1l8bxq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1l8bxq9/midday_energy_boost/,Midday Energy Boost?,"This is mostly for me, but I also admit it's also for my AuDHD child (5yo). Both of us are medicated (non-stimulants for now), both of us are pooped by noon every day. It's definitely a side effect of meds for my kid, but I'm just a tired mess in general and have struggled in the past with energy levels. 

Right now, we have a schedule that allows us to take a nap in the day. But as I'm looking into getting a job (currently a SAHM), I'm finding it really need a lunchtime boost to get me through the day. I don't mind black tea, but I do get sick of it pretty quickly. I really dislike coffee and I know energy drinks are not the way to go, but I definitely could use *something.* I try to do some movement because I know if I have a task, I can usually last longer, but only for another hour or two. Plus, it's hot as balls already and the humiditiddies are back with vengence this year. It won't be long before you have to pry me out from under my AC vent with a crowbar. 

What works for you? Do I have to conform to coffee, hope tea becomes a long-term love, or is there a magical wand I can go find?! Bonus if my 5yo can also do it, as the poor kid is struggling to stay awake for preschool half days, let alone full school days coming up in a few short months. ",1,1749593299.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1l8bx0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l8bx0z/beneath_the_stillness/,Beneath the Stillness,"I think something’s in the woods near the river.

We were out past the second fork—where the bend curves shallow and there’s that flat rock on the bank. Locals probably know the spot. It’s the one people say Emily used to fish from. You know—the sisters from the coffee shop. The kind ones. Everyone in town talks about them like they’re the only ones who really see what’s going on.

I never used to believe that kind of talk. Just thought they were sweet, quiet girls who ran a good place.

But after what I saw…
I’m starting to wonder if the rumors are true.

We got there just before dawn. Mist was clinging to the surface like it didn’t want to let go. Everything smelled like pine, wet stone, and cold air. It felt real. Steady. Safe.
We joked a bit, talked about nothing. It felt normal.

By 6:15 we had both lines in. No bites. Even the birds were lazy.

And then the wind changed.

Not the weather. Just… the way the air moved. Like it was hiding between the trees instead of moving through them.

I remember thinking: It’s too quiet for wind.
That was the first thing that felt wrong.

The second was the sound. Not loud. Barely there. Like something sighing under the water.

He stood up first. Said he saw something move on the opposite bank.
I told him to sit back down—that it was probably a beaver or a log or something.

But he didn’t sit down.

He stepped forward onto the rock.

And the water moved.

It didn’t splash. It didn’t ripple.
It peeled. Like skin. Like it opened up for something.

There was a shape—long, thin, too pale to be an animal. Too smooth to be a branch.
It wasn’t fast. That’s the part that still messes me up. It didn’t lunge. It just… reached.

I tried to shout, but nothing came out.
And he didn’t get a chance to scream.

It took him.
Pulled him under without a sound. No splash. No bubbles.
Just gone.

I ran. Left the rods. The tackle box. Everything.
Didn’t look back once.

That was yesterday.

This morning, I went back. I don’t even know why. Maybe to prove to myself I wasn’t crazy.

The gear was still there.
The rock was dry.

But there were marks in the dirt. Drag marks. Like something had slid—not walked—from the river into the woods.

I don’t know what I saw.
But I know something’s out there. And I don’t think it’s done.



If this reaches the sisters—Emily, Tiffany—I don’t know if you remember me, but I’ve been to your shop more times than I can count. You probably remember my order more than my face. Doesn’t matter.

People say you notice things others don’t.

I hope to God they’re right.
Because something’s waking up out there.

And I think it already knows our names. I don't know what IT is but I know it sees us. And It knows what we fear.

I took it at a coffee shop which closed while I was taking the last section, which caused me to time out after answering 3 or 4 questions. With that said, I scored a 153.

I think I finished the first section with 6 questions left. 



Does anyone have any tips on improving my reading speed? I've never studied for the LSAT before and this seems to be the most obvious low-hanging fruit for me.

For the past 7 months, I have been going on roughly 2\~ dates per week with women who are my personal 9-10/10 using exclusively realistic AI pictures of myself.

Not one night stands. Actual, genuine connections.

# Notes and Disclaimers

1. **I am dating women I’m genuinely attracted to.** For some men they might be meh, for others super hot. I am not saying AI pics will land you Victoria Secret models 24/7. That is not what I'm personally after either.
2. **The pics are still congruent to my lifestyle/looks.** I am not generating pics of me on Porsches and so on. All the pics were in places I have been (I’ve been living as a digital nomad since 2018, so I do travel a lot) and doing things I normally do.
3. **I'm not changing my features.** I do make my muscles slightly more toned and improve subtly some aspect of my appearance (lessen eyebags, for example). However, they all look realisitc, incuding blemishes and imperfections on my body and face. I do work out 5 times a week for quite a few years now, have a religiously strict diet and take very good care of myself.
4. **I am an average man.** I don't get IOIs often. I am currently located in Brazil, where it's easier, but I have tested this method in Europe and USA with great success as well. If there is enough curiosity I will post screenshots later.
5. **10%\~ of the time women do think it's AI**, but guess what: they thought I was AI when I was using ONLY real pictures professionally shot with a few selfies looking fairly natural. If they insist on it, I suggest a video call.
6. **Eventually I mention the pictures are fake.** Once we have been on a few dates and there is a connection, I do bring it up. So far none of them cared about it.
7. **My goal is not to get X matches, but to build connections.** It's crucial to make it clear that these are women I have genuine connections with. If one of them goes to a surgery or something, I'll in the hospital with them. They count on me, and I count on them.
8. **Not catfish**. Yes, the ethics are debatable, but all women I met IRL were fine with it since I look the exact same, I even received compliments more than once of how they thought I were fake and were pleased to see I'm the exact same. In fact, I find it more ethical than using filters since the AI replicates all my 'imperfections'.
9. **I already had experience with women before this,** but always had trouble attracting/meeting new women. I used to work as a musician in my early 20s, so I'd meet women often. After that, especially with remote work and being naturally more reclusive, it was a battle. Dating apps never worked well for me until now.

# About Me & My Dating Philosophy

32M, 175cm, 65kgs, mixed with European and Latino. I'm a senior software dev and am quite experienced with both dating and tech.

In regards to dating, I believe people have two types of value:

* Perceived value: what the world sees (achievements, looks, etc)
* Actual value: who you truly are (morals, perspective of life, thoughts, personality, etc)

As a human, actual value is way more important. But in dating both matter:

* Perceived value attracts
* Actual value seduces, connects and nurtures the connection.

If you don’t groom yourself or present a lifestyle, your perceived value drops and you won’t get initial attraction. Once you have high perceived value, you attract women of similar perceived value.

And that is something I noticed in the past 7 months trying different AI pics with different settings: most women with a similar lifestyle will be drawn to you, despite your attractiveness. When I portray myself as a ""gym rat"", I attract more gym rats girls.

When I portray myself as a traveler, more girls who like traveling matched with me. Before this I assumed that this wouldn't change much (as long as I'm attractive I will match with most girls), and although to a certain degree this is true, I was surprised to see it's not that black and white.

# How I Created My AI Pictures

I use Flux to generate the pictures. I created my own Lora with 16 selfies and 6 body images from previous photoshoots and loaded it on Flux. There are many tutorials out there that show how to achieve this. You will need to pay a few bucks to rent the PC online, unless you have a very good computer.

For most of the pics I use additional loras like ""Amateurs Photography \[Flux Dev\]"" to add a realisitc feel.

# What My Pictures Look Like

I won't share the original pictures, but if you guys are curious I can ask chatgpt to recreate them. I will describe each of them:

first picture: shirtless, fit, on the beach, rottweiler dog sitting beside me, sunny, ocean behind me, Looking at the camera, sitting on one of these fancy huts that I have no idea what they're called. Balance between friendly and masculine

second pic: Me sitting on a rooftop, well dressed, suit, sitting the floor, same rottweiler dog lying beside me, buildings behind me, kinda foggy, looking at the camera. Very masculine shot

third pic: simple selfie on the mirror, not AI. My face covers probably 40% of the pic, it's very close up

fourth pic: close up shot of me in the top of mountains, snow, holding snowboard, looking at camera, majestic background

# What Type of Pictures Worked Best In My Tests

1. Eye contact. Whether you're smiling or not, eye contact seems to be what works the best for me
2. At least one pic smiling. I don't have any pic smiling with my teeth (even though they may help as well), but even soft smiles are crucial
3. Majestic backgrounds. Having a beautiful background behind you, especially if it's a luxurious place or nature, is going to help
4. Show your body off in appropriate places. If you're fit, show it off on the beach, pool, etc. It does help a LOT. I probably doubled my matches when I changed my first pic to the shirtless one.
5. Well dressed. Highly recommended having pic in a nice suit or very well dressed.
6. Action shot. Doing a cool sport, working out, fighting, playing an instrument in front of a crowd, public talking, etc.

The picture you want to use highly depends on the type of women you want to attract. I am not interested in having well dressed pics because the type of women that I want to attract don't really care about that.

# What Apps I Use, Texting & Setting Up Dates

Depends on the country, but mostly Facebook Dating, Bumble and Instagram. Yep, Instagram. I search for businesses near me (restaurants, etc), look for the women liking the posts/following the page and follow them on IG. If they follow me back, I DM. That is how I met my two current girlfriends whom I've been dating for roughly 6 months.

In regards to texting and dating, I have my own method of texting + setting up a date as quickly as possible. Basically I keep replying within 2-5 minutes after her reply and keep things flowing and giving her as much attention as possible. After 1 - 3 days, depending on how much I like her, I will ask her out.

I usually take girls out to a simple walk in the park or coffee. I never do dinner dates or spend much money at all with dates.

1l8bs91,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l8bs91/i_am_completely_alone_in_my_life_and_its_getting/,I am completely alone in my life and it’s getting to my head.,"I (20 F/NB) am mentally gearing up for a really awful summer. 

My entire life I’ve been really lonely. I’ve never had any long friendships for over a few years, and now I’m in a phase where I don’t speak with anybody at all. I just finished my junior year of college and I’m on campus for an internship. I’m away from my family but that doesn’t really make a difference as that’s never been a good relationship. I got out of a two and a half year relationship two months ago now. I work alone. My internship is alone. I don’t get along with any people in my major beyond a casual academic relationship. During the regular year I’m much more social because of my job as an RA but I’m not doing it for the summer. The only people I anticipate seeing are my research mentors. I bet that nobody will remember my 21st birthday next month. 

I get why I’m so alone. I don’t drink or smoke. I don’t party. I barely leave my room. I have autism and chronic pain and other issues with my body. According to my ex I’m unsettling, whatever that means anyways. I’m pretty mentally ill. Therapy never really worked and I don’t think my meds are either. I’m not a straight cisgender woman. I’m asexual to a degree, that’s a recent confusing development where I have a lot to unpack. My physical appearance could leave something to be desired for some. I have philosophical conversations like this to Reddit, and when it’s not written down I’m speaking this nonsense to whoever is around me. 

All that being said I’ve had some weird existential crises of late. I’ve realized that I am extremely depressed and unfulfilled in my life but it’s not an issue with my self image. My career is really promising. I have a 3.9 GPA. I have a good internship, I’m smart, but humble enough to know my limits and step back to learn. I have plenty of hobbies, I read constantly lately, and I have a cat who I adore. I am so fully completely satisfied with myself and what I am doing. I paint, I draw, dance, im giving and affectionate and I have so much love I want to share. I’m not perfect by any means but I know my worth. I just wish someone else could see me for what I am. Despite my ramblings on my shortcomings I know I am extremely capable, beautiful, kind, talented, and intellectual, if not to someone else than to myself. 

Every conversation I have ends with me being made fun of somehow. My relationship ended over career politics and upon reflection I was letting a guy treat me like crap for affection. After that ended I started speaking with a friend who’s also a guy but it devolved into him being strange and flirty when I stated I didn’t want anything so I don’t feel very comfortable talking to him much anymore. I don’t have anybody in my life I can speak my mind to. Hell, I went and got coffee today with friends and I left feeling even sadder than when I got there. Somethings probably deeply clinically wrong with me and I could likely use a lot of intensive therapy and whatever but I have no money nor insurance. 

That leaves me to this summer. I live alone. I’m six hours away from my brothers. I’m working full time remotely most days. The human connections I have here have been honestly one sided. I don’t feel like anybody actually wants to be around me. Despite being completely perfectly career satisfied and prepared to go to graduate school and work and live my life, I’m so fucking sad. I don’t even miss my ex all that much after a long list of realizations that I settled for less than I deserve. My physical needs are met alone. I’m so completely emotionally starved. I’m writing this from a rock at the local creek which brings comfort sometimes but tonight I’m just watching happy couples and families and feeling like shit about my inability to be that happy. Even in a long term relationship I was never anybody’s first choice and that’s all I’ve ever wanted. 

The hardest part of being in college and being 20 and now a senior is that I’m supposed to have the college experience and have it all sorted to graduate with my friends and family at my sides and I am so completely alone in it all. Nobody is looking for new friends right now. Nobody wants me. Not as their first choice or second or not even their last choice. It gets a lot easier when I’m in classes and I’m back in my RA role because at least I’m useful. Right now I’m just simply not that for anybody or anything. I am floating in some weird abject summer of hell. I’m not ready to fuck around on dating apps. I just go to the movie theater alone now, sometimes concerts. 

I understand that it’ll get easier in time. I do. I’m just scared that that unspecified “time” is longer than I can stomach. I just need to survive my summer. Then maybe I’ll be better, if not okay. ",2,1749592914.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1l8brjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1l8brjo/what_could_be_causing_kidney_pain/,What could be causing kidney pain?,"I get pain in my kidneys anytime I drink anything that is not water. I had some blood work and a cystoscopy and everything came back normal. I was told that what I am experiencing is ""a feeling of fullness"" that should go away when I pee. But, it's a sharp or pinching and consistent pain for hours after drinking e.g., coffee, tea, alcohol, electrolytes, smoothies, etc. 

Last year when I was tested I had repeated indication of hemoglobin and red blood cells in my urine. My pee was sometimes frothy, cloudy, or oily in the morning. This was mostly resolved by a treatment for interstitial cystitis. Right now I have low Ferritin and elevated serum protein IgM (5.3 g/L).

The reason this concerns me is that PKD and Kidney Nephropathy IgA both run in my family, but the doctors say it's not that. Also, When I was in Grade 2, a teacher wouldn't let me use the bathroom and my bladder backed up into my kidneys.

There is a little more to it, too. I have a poor physical reaction to stress, in that I feel jittery, dehydrated, nauseated, and inflamed when I experience stress (feels like I drank too much coffee and have the flu aches at the same time). When this happens, my kidneys seem to kick into overgear and I pee literally every hour. It feels like my body isn't holding onto any the water that I drink, and my bones start to feel cold and at the same time I'm still dehydrated. Electrolytes help with the feeling of dehydration, but not the other symptoms. 

I am 37 female 135 pounds with a very healthy diet. I drink 1-2 L water a day. I'm not getting enough physical exercise because exertion triggers this stress reponse. I am experiencing other chronic health symptoms and I wonder if they are all related. Essentially, I have chronic fatigue, inflammation, pain, brain fog, a feeling like my brain is swelling, extremely heavy menses, and inconsistent appetite and digestion. I have been on a low histamine diet and have been doing breathwork exercises to regulate my nervous system for around a month and it has been helping with the some of these symptoms and the frequency of the stress response, but not the kidney pain. 

What could be causing the kidney pain? Any recommendations for what I can do about it or my other health concerns? Or, advice for navigating the health system? Thanks",1,1749592866.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1l8bpxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TownshipGame/comments/1l8bpxw/beware_hiring_the_dealer_for_a_day/,Beware hiring the dealer for a day!,"I decided to hire the dealer for a day for 12 T cash and it was AWESOME!! But beware... I was obsessed and practically used him on the hour every hour after each of his coffee breaks!

It was completely exhausting but I picked up 16 different products! At level 41 I found the biggest bang for your back and most useful were: nylon thread (bought the max amt twice), plastic, plums, rubber, clothes lines, bananas (while I was waiting the two days for my island to open), syrup, glue, suits, honey caramel, cheesecake, paper. If I had more time I would have purchased inflatable rafts and caramel. I found that these products were always high in demand, or took much too long to produce. 

Obviously, items would be different for different levels. I purchased ingots but found they weren't worth it compared to what I could get in the mine. I also compared the prices of products offered every four hours when the market opened and found that those from my searches were the least expensive. Curious about others' experiences using this amazing feature of the game. Shhhhh though- as they may increase the t-cash required! 😆",2,1749592764.0,TownshipGame,1,1.0,False
1l8bpvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l8bpvo/i_expected_rejection_but_was_met_with_warmth/,"I expected rejection, but was met with warmth instead.","A couple months ago I reached out to my ex, together for 7 years, knew each other for 10 at the time, been a decade of no contact since we broke up. I didn't know what to say or what to think. I fully expected to just get told to go f*** myself.

That.. didn't happen. To my surprise they were very kind and actually happy to hear from me! I was just absolutely floored. An entire decade went by and I thought about reaching out to them quite a few times but I ultimately decided not to because I had thought that their life would be infinitely better with me not being part of it again.

So, we started talking and.. things have went well! There's a lot of things I'm working through with help from my therapist but I am just still so shocked that it's went so incredibly well!

I've always been the person to kind of wait for the ""perfect moment"" to do.. really anything that I deemed meaningful and I actually got over that little hump recently! I asked this person out for a coffee and despite my terrible anxiety and really bad social skills.. it went really well! There was even a brief exchange we had that made me hopeful something like that may happen again in the future too!

Since our little ""meeting for the first time, again"" get together thing at the coffee place I swear I've just been glowing with joy. And while I'm really happy so far I'm also deathly terrified of screwing things up. Again. I never had any idea at all that things could have worked out so well so soon! I mean, it's only been a couple months really.

And I'm really excited to see both where this goes and how it goes. I can't say I really have any expectations right now of how/where I want it to go but.. definitely excited for the journey!

Clean, crisp, super dry, just a little minerality from the brett. Casey Helles is nice - more citrus than I expected, but really good. As Above from Mortalis is an approachable coffee Stout with strong mocha vibes. Cellarmaker tastes like straight up hoppy orange juice - they always nail it. Teenage Jesus from Bizarre is killer! We don't see many English Oat Bitters, and it's really nice. Bellatrix  brings delightfully funky flavors with lots of fruit and a solid pucker factor. ",7,1749592707.0,CraftBeer,1,1.0,False

I would not want to shave my healthy teeth for veeners, but I am unsure if composite bonding would look good?
And is it possible to bleach my teeth so they don't look so yellow?
According to the dentist they could just bleach them 1 shade whiter which still looked yellowish?
And should I get invisalign or something for my lower teeth, even though they are not visible when smiling?

1l8bky5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1l8bky5/i_fucked_my_bengali_friends_wife/,I fucked my Bengali friend's wife,"I stay in a small town near Mumbai. I was driving my car in the rain when I noticed my Bengali friend's wife standing under a tree to save herself from getting wet in the heavy rain. She has a grocery baskets and I assumed she has been to the market. I stopped the car in front of her and gave her a lift home.

After we reached her building I offered to carry one of the load home. By the time we entered the building both of us were soaking wet. We went to her apartment on the third floor and I kept the basket in the kitchen. I was about to leave but she insisted that I stay back for sometime because the rain is getting heavier and I might find it difficult to go back home. So she handed me a towel and asked me to remove my clothes in the bathroom. 

I wrapped the towel round my waist and came out. I was so cold but being in front of her in a towel was a bit arousing. I got a erection and it was difficult to hid it from her. I apologised for that and she said ""It's okay. This is natural.""

She went to the bathroom. I could hear the washing machine start so she probably but my clothes to wash and dry. She came out wrapped in a towel. The towel started from her below her armpits and ended just below her buttock. Her hair was open and wet.

She asked me if I would like tea or coffee. And asked for coffee and she disappeared in the kitchen. Will she was walking I could see the lower portion of her buttocks. I went to the kitchen to check on her. My dick had become rock hard by now. I quietly touched my dick to her ass from behind. She quickly turned around and dropped her towel. It was the most beautiful sight. A perfect curvy body. She was like a nude Bengali goddess.

I fucked her in the ass on the dinning table.

1l8bk9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l8bk9q/i_am_dating_2_womenweek_irl_using_ai_pics_ama/,I am dating 2+ women/week IRL using AI pics. AMA.,"Yes. For the past 7 months, I have been going on roughly 2\~ dates per week with women who are my personal 9-10/10 using exclusively realistic AI pictures of myself.

Not one night stands. Actual, genuine connections. 

# Notes and Disclaimers

1. **I am dating women I’m genuinely attracted to.** For some men they might be meh, for others super hot. I am not saying AI pics will land you Victoria Secret models 24/7. That is not what I'm personally after either.
2. **The pics are still congruent to my lifestyle/looks.** I am not generating pics of me on Porsches and so on. All the pics were in places I have been (I’ve been living as a digital nomad since 2018, so I do travel a lot) and doing things I normally do.
3. **I'm not changing my features.** I do make my muscles slightly more toned and improve subtly some aspect of my appearance (lessen eyebags, for example). However, they all look realisitc, incuding blemishes and imperfections on my body and face. I do work out 5 times a week for quite a few years now, have a religiously strict diet and take very good care of myself.
4. **I am an average man.** I don't get IOIs often. I am currently located in Brazil, where it's easier, but I have tested this method in Europe and USA with great success as well. If there is enough curiosity I will post screenshots later.
5. **10%\~ of the time women do think it's AI**, but guess what: they thought I was AI when I was using ONLY real pictures professionally shot with a few selfies looking fairly natural. If they insist on it, I suggest a video call. 
6. **Eventually I mention the pictures are fake.** Once we have been on a few dates and there is a connection, I do bring it up. So far none of them cared about it.
7. **My goal is not to get X matches, but to build connections.** It's crucial to make it clear that these are women I have genuine connections with. If one of them goes to a surgery or something, I'll in the hospital with them. They count on me, and I count on them.
8. **Not catfish**. Yes, the ethics are debatable, but all women I met IRL were fine with it since I look the exact same, I even received compliments more than once of how they thought I were fake and were pleased to see I'm the exact same. If you don't like it, just don't do it. As long as you keep the images realistic and congruent to who you are, I think it does much more good than harm.
9. **I already had experience with women before this,** but always had trouble attracting/meeting new women. I used to work as a musician in my early 20s, so I'd meet women often. After that, especially with remote work and being naturally more reclusive, it was a battle. Dating apps never worked well for me until now.

# About Me & My Dating Philosophy

32M, 175cm, 65kgs, mixed with European and Latino. I'm a senior software dev and am quite experienced with both dating and tech.

In regards to dating, I believe people have two types of value:

* Perceived value: what the world sees (achievements, looks, etc)
* Actual value: who you truly are (morals, perspective of life, thoughts, personality, etc)

As a human, actual value is way more important. But in dating both matter:

* Perceived value attracts
* Actual value seduces, connects and nurtures the connection.

If you don’t groom yourself or present a lifestyle, your perceived value drops and you won’t get initial attraction. Once you have high perceived value, you attract women of similar perceived value. 

And that is something I noticed in the past 7 months trying different AI pics with different settings: most women with a similar lifestyle will be drawn to you, despite your attractiveness. When I portray myself as a ""gym rat"", I attract more gym rats girls.   
  
When I portray myself as a traveler, more girls who like traveling matched with me. Before this I assumed that this wouldn't change much (as long as I'm attractive I will match with most girls), and although to a certain degree this is true, I was surprised to see it's not that black and white.

# How I Created My AI Pictures

I use Flux to generate the pictures. I created my own Lora with 16 selfies and 6 body images from previous photoshoots and loaded it on Flux. There are many tutorials out there that show how to achieve this. You will need to pay a few bucks to rent the PC online, unless you have a very good computer.

For most of the pics I use additional loras like ""Amateurs Photography \[Flux Dev\]"" to add a realisitc feel.

# What My Pictures Look Like 

I won't share the original pictures, but if you guys are curious I can ask chatgpt to recreate them. I will describe each of them:

first picture: shirtless, fit, on the beach, rottweiler dog sitting beside me, sunny, ocean behind me, Looking at the camera, sitting on one of these fancy huts that I have no idea what they're called. Balance between friendly and masculine

second pic: Me sitting on a rooftop, well dressed, suit, sitting the floor, same rottweiler dog lying beside me, buildings behind me, kinda foggy, looking at the camera. Very masculine shot

third pic: simple selfie on the mirror, not AI. My face covers probably 40% of the pic, it's very close up

fourth pic: close up shot of me in the top of mountains, snow, holding snowboard, looking at camera, majestic background

# What Type of Pictures Worked Best In My Tests

1. Eye contact. Whether you're smiling or not, eye contact seems to be what works the best for me
2. At least one pic smiling. I don't have any pic smiling with my teeth (even though they may help as well), but even soft smiles are crucial
3. Majestic backgrounds. Having a beautiful background behind you, especially if it's a luxurious place or nature, is going to help
4. Show your body off in appropriate places. If you're fit, show it off on the beach, pool, etc. It does help a LOT. I probably doubled my matches when I changed my first pic to the shirtless one.
5. Well dressed. Highly recommended having pic in a nice suit or very well dressed.
6. Action shot. Doing a cool sport, working out, fighting, playing an instrument in front of a crowd, public talking, etc.

The picture you want to use highly depends on the type of women you want to attract. I am not interested in having well dressed pics because the type of women that I want to attract don't really care about that.

# What Apps I Use, Texting & Setting Up Dates

Depends on the country, but mostly Facebook Dating, Bumble and Instagram. Yep, Instagram. I search for businesses near me (restaurants, etc), look for the women liking the posts/following the page and follow them on IG. If they follow me back, I DM. That is how I met my two current girlfriends whom I've been dating for roughly 6 months.  
  
In regards to texting and dating, I have my own method of texting + setting up a date as quickly as possible. Basically I keep replying within 2-5 minutes after her reply and keep things flowing and giving her as much attention as possible. After 1 - 3 days, depending on how much I like her, I will ask her out. 

I usually take girls out to a simple walk in the park or coffee. I never do dinner dates or spend much money at all with dates.

Beyond this green onion I would really like to branch into growing peppers and flowers.

I'm wondering if anyone would be able to provide me with any advice for increasing the nutritional value of the soil I'm acquiring from the surrounding forest. I just tried adding some used coffee grinds on day 7 to see if that effects the growth in anyway.

1l8beum,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l8beum/sp_press_play/,[SP] Press Play,"Calen Holloway wasn’t some chosen one. He was a pretty normal junior at Westbrook High: skinny, a little sarcastic, and totally obsessed with waffles. If you’d asked him what he wanted out of life, it probably would’ve been something simple like, “A girlfriend, decent grades, and maybe a car that doesn’t die on uphill roads.” And somehow, he already had the first two.

Her name was Lila Reyes. She laughed like she didn’t care who was listening and kissed like she meant it. Everybody who knew her liked her. Heck, even his parents liked her, and they hadn't wanted him to date until he was eighteen. She didn't know it yet, but he was going to marry her someday.

But all that was before CEMA showed up at his school, just after homeroom.

Before he learned what he was.

They took him away to a gray building with no windows, gave him a cookie that somehow tasted like shame and oatmeal, and explained in very calm voices that he could stop time.

Only, not like in the movies.

“If you use your power,” Agent Kellerman said, “you can’t start time again. Time won’t resume until everyone in mortal danger has been saved.”

“Everyone? How do I even know who’s in danger?”

“You won’t. You'll have to just keep searching until you find them all. It could take decades.”

“How do you know all this?”

“My superpower is the ability to identify superpowers,” she said, like she was telling him the weather.

""That sounds like a stupid superpower,"" he scoffed.

""You'd be surprised.""

That was basically the whole meeting. He signed some forms. They gave him a backpack full of “just-in-case” supplies (first aid kit, flashlight, poncho, whistle) and a stern warning: “Don’t be a hero.”

So obviously, three weeks later, he stopped time to save his girlfriend.

Lila stepped into the street. Headphones in. Car barreling toward her. Calen didn't think. He just acted.

And everything froze.

The car stood in the middle of the street like it was parked. Lila’s hair framed her face, caught mid-sway like a photograph. A bird in the sky was stuck in a perfect V-shape. A leaf hung motionless in the air like it forgot how gravity works.

Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. Even the slight breeze had ceased.

And then Calen realized: he’d done it. He'd really done it.

He kicked a pebble. It bounced once before stopping in the air. He grabbed the motionless leaf. It moved normally in his hands, but froze again when he let go.

And then he realized: he couldn’t undo it.

\---

He saved Lila, of course. That part was easy - just picked her up and moved her out of the street. Set her back on the sidewalk like she hadn't ever left it.

Then he tried to restart time.

It didn't work.

So he did what they had told him. He started wandering, searching for other people to save. The first few he saved were obvious. A construction worker, falling off a roof. A hiker, sliding off a cliff, reaching for a tree that was just a little too far away. By the fifth, he noticed something. A tightness in his ribs, a pressure at the base of his skull, when he touched them. Like the universe was nudging him. After he moved them to safety, the feeling went away.

People in no danger? Nothing.

At first, frozen time was… kind of awesome. He borrowed a motorcycle and roared through frozen traffic like a post-apocalyptic action hero. Then the gas ran out and the pumps were as dead as everything else. He'd return it later. He upgraded to a sporty Tesla, laughing to himself at the irony. Silent car, silent planet. When the battery died, he found a helicopter, studied the manual, and decided to try it out.

He landed it on a skyscraper.

Never flew one again.

He found a frozen hospice. Rows of patients, withered by age or sickness. Their charts said they were dying. He touched each of them. There was no tug. These were not his to save. He left, throat dry.

He didn't know the rules for who to save, and who couldn't be saved. What if they were about to die from something he couldn't see? He'd have to check every person he came across, to see if he felt that tug.

He visited every city. Every town. He drove every single road, crossed them all off on an ever increasing pile of maps. Saved more people than he could count.

And still, he couldn't restart time. Nothing anywhere but silence and stillness.

\---

He tried to track the time that passed. He wanted to mark off days on a calendar, to prove how long he'd been here. But how could you measure time when time itself had stopped?

Clocks were useless, of course hands dead on their faces. Phones were bricks, screens frozen mid-notification. Even his heartbeat, steady and unchanging, told him nothing about how long it had been beating.

Was it day or night? The sun didn’t move. Shadows didn’t creep. The world held its breath, and Calen was left with the metronome of his thoughts.

He couldn't even count on his bodily functions. He didn't need to eat or even sleep. Silver lining: No bathroom breaks.

Time was meaningless. There was just one continuous now, stretching into eternity.

The only thing worse than eternity was the fear that it might never end.

\---

Eventually, he left the country. First time ever.

Technically, he ""snuck"" across the Mexican border.

Realistically, he just drove through, waving at a frozen border guard like 'Sup.'

Then he did it again. And again.

One day, he found a group mid-crossing. Actual people, looking terrified, frozen in fear mid-run.

He loaded them into the back of his truck and drove them all the way to Ohio.

Just in case. Just to make sure they wouldn't be caught near the border when the world started spinning again.

\---

He snagged a journal from a college bookstore and started writing. The first entry:

“Saved Lila. Obviously. Then realized that wasn’t enough. So I started searching.”

Later entries included:

""I don't get hungry. I tried to eat a burger. Tasted like cardboard. Couldn't even swallow. I miss waffles.""

“Collapsed mine in Chile. Took forever to dig. Found a guy alive in an air pocket. Dragged him out. Kept digging. Just bodies. I brought them all up anyway. For their families.”

""Stopped by home. Mom's still watching TV. Dad's still in a meeting at work, glancing at his phone like something better's coming. Talked to Lila. She ignored me, like always. I kissed her like a Disney princess. She didn't wake up.""

""Drew a mustache on Principal Billings. Not as funny as I thought. I cleaned it off. Mostly. Replaced it a clown nose. That was better.""

""Found a car crash. Two people. One's heart was already stopped. No tug. The other was really hurt. Brought him to the hospital. The tug didn't go away. I'll have to get back to him later, when I know what to do.""

“Learned how to suture. Turns out, not that hard. No one bleeds out if time doesn't move. I have all the time in the world to be careful.”

""Found a monster. His victims were still alive. I saved them. Then I found his camera. I put the victims back, took photos. Documented everything. Saved them again. Wanted to kill him. Instead, I left him in a police holding cell, camera around an officer's neck, big signs everywhere. I hope he rots.""

""Left a letter in Lila's pocket. Told her I loved her. Told her I missed her.""

""How the %$@#% do you cure cancer? There's no tug, but still, can't I do something? Just leaving them there feels like murder. Is it?""

“Mastered the Rubik’s Cube. Threw it into a volcano. Felt nothing.”

""Broke into the Pentagon. National secrets? Mostly just dumb spreadsheets.""

""Took my letter out of Lila's pocket. Realized it was selfish. Replaced it with a note that said, 'I'm okay.'""

""Airplanes. So many in flight. So hard to reach. What if I missed one?""

Final entry, scribbled on a water-stained page:

“If I stop, does that mean time never starts again?”

He stuck his letter to Lila between the pages, and tossed the journal into the sea. Where it sat on top of the water, waiting for time to restart.

\---

He stopped saving people. Just… wandered.

Slept in the fanciest hotels. Swam alone in infinity pools. Broke into mansions, lay on velvet beds, stared at crystal chandeliers until he felt like he might shatter, too.

He watched at the frozen face of a barista mid-pour, wondering if her coffee would ever finish dripping.

He explored museums, touching paintings that said ""Do not touch"", moving exhibits slightly off-center. Left a sticky note on the Mona Lisa that just said, ""Smile more.""

The silence was deafening.

\---

He stood on a bridge, looking down.

It seemed like ages ago that he'd noticed a speck. Someone who had jumped. He'd scavenged an absurd amount of rope and climbing gear. Rappelled down. Harnessed them.  Used ascenders to climb back up the rope. Pull them back up, inch by grueling inch.

He couldn't even remember if it had been a man or a woman.

“If I jump,” he wondered, “does time stay like this forever?”

The entire world, the entire universe, frozen in a single breath. The thought made him shudder.

He moved on.

\---

A park.

He played on the swings, slow and aimless, letting the chains creak in the still air.

A little girl hung in the air nest to a jungle gym, halfway through falling off. Mouth open. Eyes wide. The fear frozen on her face. There was no tug. The fall would hurt, but it wouldn't be enough to kill her, or even break any bones.

He kept swinging, watching her.

Her hair was the same color as Lila's.

He got up.

He caught her.

And then he got back to work.

\---

He'd been to this island three times before.

Searched every trail, every rock, every palm grove. Found nothing. Each time, he'd left thinking, *There's no one here.*

But time was still frozen. Somewhere on this wide world, he had missed someone. So he was searching the globe yet again. And now he was back on this island.

And this time he saw it.

A sliver of darkness, barely there behind a curtain of vines. A cave no bigger than a closet.

Inside, curled in a nest of palm leaves and rags, was an old man. Skin sunken tight over bone. Hollow eyes closed. He looked like a skeleton left behind by time itself.

But Calen felt the tug.

The man wasn't dead. Just… paused.

Starving, too weak to cry out, maybe too weak to crawl. No one else on this island to call for help even if he could.

Calen built a stretcher. Two sticks of driftwood. A blanket from his pack. He'd gone through countless backpacks by now. They wore out. He didn't.

He dragged the man across the beach. Then across the ocean. Step by step. With time stopped, walking on water was old news.

He didn't know how long it took. Weeks? Years? There were no clocks or calendars in forever.

He reached Guam and continued across the beach to the pavement. He imagined conversations with the frozen people he passed. Told them what he was doing. Nodded at their silence. Pretended they approved.

When he finally stepped into the hospital in Guam, and laid the old man gently onto a real stretcher…

Time started.

Sound hit him like a tsunami, almost bowling him over. Sirens, voices, alarms. The old man gasped. Nurses yelled. Machines beeped. Doors slammed.

Calen dropped to his knees. After all the silence. After all the stillness.

Had it been decades? Centuries? It was over. He'd saved them *all*.

He wept.

\---

His parents ruffled his hair. “You look tired,” his mom said. ""You have ever since we flew you back from Guam.""

Lila kissed him, then frowned. “You okay?”

He wanted to say:

*I performed open-heart surgery on a frozen man in a frozen OR. When I finished, his heart just… didn't beat. The tug went away, but I didn't know if that meant I’d saved him or killed him. Eventually I had to walk away and hope I'd done enough.*

Instead, he said:

“Yeah. Just spaced out.”

\---

The news called it “The Miracle Rescues.” A climber found safely at the base of a cliff. A stroke victim waking up mid-surgery, healed. A child pulled from a burning building, unharmed. Little mention was made of the thousands of tiny thefts, of borrowed materials that were never returned.

Generally, angels or other miraculous forces were given credit. CEMA helped hide any evidence that hinted at who had actually done the rescuing.

Kellerman found him at a diner, eating his first waffle in an eternity.

“You used it,” she said.

He didn’t answer. The waffle tasted like nostalgia and ash. He added more syrup.

“We can help,” she said. “Therapists who believe you. Recovery time. Training in any skills you can imagine. So next time…”

“Next time?” He laughed, raw. “You think I’d do this again?”

She slid a folder across the table. Satellite images. A hurricane. A warzone.

“It would be your choice. We aren't your masters. But know this: you’re the only one who can do it. I wish I could tell you that we won't ever need you again. But my gut says otherwise. Someday, we are going to need you. The world is going to need you. And if we do… I hope you'll say yes.”

He stared out the window. A mom held her kid’s hand, crossing the street. A dog barked at a butterfly.

Life.

He slid the folder back. ""Not today. But someday.""

Kellerman nodded. Outside, the world moved on, unaware of how fragile it really was.

Calen took a deep breath, then exhaled. “Train me,” he said. ""And I'll need a better backpack. That last one sucked.""

When the world needed him to pause it again…

1l8besd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hackney/comments/1l8besd/looking_to_move_to_hackney_help_me_please/,Looking to move to Hackney help me please,"
Hi all! I’m moving flats, I'm a bit overwhelmed mess given how the housing market is. I have fallen in love with the Hackney vibe, but I want to make sure I land in the right bit. 

I'm a woman in my early 30s, working in central, and I’m looking for a one bed flat around the Hackney/London Fields area. My dream is to live somewhere that is calm, safe, but still quite close to great coffee, parks, pubs, community hotspots 

I loved London fields area but different blocks can be very different, and some areas in hackney prices are wild! I just need tips filtering out areas. 

Where would you live if you were looking for similar vibe? Think whole hackney borough. 
Any streets or blocks to avoid, even within ""good"" areas?

Thank you, truly appreciate any tips!

I was in awe and would think to myself how long it’ll take me to get to this level. One day I talked to him and he gave me some suggestions on how to improve my technique. Fast forward to today: I managed to swim 1000m. I haven’t seen you in the pool recently and I hope all is well.

I (28F) have been friends with a male colleague (39M) for several years now. He’s always been super supportive—helped me move, gives great advice, makes me laugh, and generally has just been a solid presence in my life. We both have partners: I’m married, and so is he. My husband knows him and thinks he’s nice, though he has always had a gut feeling that this guy might like me more than just platonically.

The other day, during a coffee break, we were casually scrolling through photos on his phone together (looking at memes or something, I don’t remember exactly), and I caught a glimpse of something unexpected: screenshots of pictures of me. Not selfies we took together or group photos—these were clearly screenshots from my profile pictures on whatsapp.

I was stunned and just kind of stared at him. He noticed and, without hesitation or shame, ""confessed"" that he screenshots photos of me that he thinks are especially pretty. He brushed it off like it was totally normal and not a big deal. I was so taken aback in the moment that I just let it go. But since then, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.

To me, it feels…off. Kind of creepy, even. I understand admiring a friend’s photo or liking something on social media, but deliberately saving them to your private phone gallery—especially when we’re both in committed relationships—feels like a boundary has been crossed. I keep thinking: how would I feel if I found out my husband was screenshotting pictures of another woman? I’d be really hurt. And I imagine his wife wouldn’t be thrilled either.

I care about my friendship with this person, I care about my marriage, and I even care about his marriage. I don’t want to assume the worst or create drama, but I also don’t want to gaslight myself into thinking this is normal if it isn’t. I haven’t told my husband yet because I know he would be furious, and I want to be sure I’m not overreacting before bringing that kind of tension into our home.

So:
Am I overreacting by feeling uncomfortable about this?
Is this something some people just do? Or is my gut telling me something I need to listen to?

Any thoughtful input would be appreciated.

> “A futanari who ejaculates in silence, without lust, without thought

Then he added what Kant would probably say:

> “The moral imperative of ejaculation does not lie in pleasure, but in the universality of its form.”



And Buddha just whispered:

> “The penis arises. The penis dissolves. Such is the nature of all phenomena.”

Utah is such a bizarre and strange place it really feels like its own separate world. When I see people talk about Mormons and soda and soaking and all this bizarre cultural stuff that’s normal here it just cracks me up bc I’m living in it seeing it every day. 

Totally bizarre world different from anywhere else on earth. 

Mormons especially feel very, fuck I don’t wanna say cult like because there’s a lot of nice Mormons, but it really is kinda uncanny and cult like community. Most Mormons won’t hangout with you if you drink alcohol or coffee or especially do drugs. 

Secret lives of Mormon wives does a beautiful job at showing how bizarre Utah is. 10/10 YouTube episode. I refuse to watch the show, hunters review is more than enough exposure to the chaos.

I was always more of a Hinge or just meet-people-in-person type, but a friend convinced me to give it a try. I live in a smaller city, so I wasn’t expecting a ton of matches, but I was kinda surprised. I got a decent amount of swipes back within the first two days.

What threw me off a bit is the whole “women message first” thing. I didn’t think much of it until I matched with someone and then… nothing. The 24-hour timer thing added some weird pressure. It also felt like a lot of people weren’t super active even though they showed up in my feed.

I did end up chatting with one girl who seemed pretty genuine and we’re grabbing coffee this weekend, so that’s a win. But overall, Bumble feels a little more rushed and kinda harder to get deeper convos going, at least compared to Hinge.

I've been trying to take my online privacy more seriously lately. With so many trackers, geo-blocks, and sketchy Wi-Fi networks out there, I figured it was time to finally get a solid VPN. What really pushed me over the edge was realizing how exposed my data is when I'm browsing, streaming, or even just using public internet at a coffee shop.

So I started looking into VPN services. I’ve heard they can do everything from hiding your IP to unblocking Netflix libraries and protecting your browsing habits. But honestly? I had no idea there were *so many* options. And trying to figure out which VPN is actually the best (and not just backed by some flashy marketing team) turned out to be way more confusing than I expected.

I spent the last few days looking into the best VPNs and wanted to share what I found in case it helps someone else. If you're trying to find the best VPN in 2025 or just want a clear and honest overview like the ones on Reddit, this might save you some time.

Here are the main things I was looking for in the best VPN:

* How strong the security and privacy protection really is (encryption, no-log policy, kill switch, leak protection)
* Speed and streaming capabilities (especially for Netflix, Disney+, and other geo-blocked content)
* Number and variety of server locations
* Ease of use across different devices
* Price and value for the features you get

Here is the Comparison Table. I made it for my own research, but I figured it might help others too. Feel free to check it out:

[VPN Comparison Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT4jSjp10_zwP1kDuZ_qFM2HppJpQFRRJuxHoK0DX-mE3LiYpv5qGl4Dxg8d5WBLyqwwcojz1PyJN5q/pubhtml)

If there are any VPN providers you think I should add to the list, or if you’ve tested one yourself that’s been great (or not so great), let me know! Also open to suggestions on other criteria that might be useful to compare.

Let’s help make this the go-to list for anyone trying to figure out the best VPN 2025, whether you're looking for speed, privacy, or just trying to unblock your favorite shows. If you’re like me and tired of sorting through biased review sites, hopefully this gives you a more transparent view.

**🎣 From Redfish Runs to Sheepshead Snaps: A Charleston Charter Journey with Captain Woods**

I wasn’t planning on becoming a regular.

The first trip was a birthday gift from my wife — one of those “get out of the house and clear your head” gestures that hit differently after a long stretch of working too much and fishing too little. Just me, my brother-in-law, a half-drunk coffee thermos, and a quiet local charter captain named **Woods**. It was early March, and a soft gray fog clung to the marshes around the Ashley River. As we pushed out toward the jetties, the **Ravenel Bridge faded behind us** into the morning mist like something from a dream.

We didn’t talk much at first. Woods had that quiet, weatherworn vibe — the kind of guy who measures time in tides, not hours. He pointed to a piling, I cast a fiddler crab, and before I could adjust my grip, the rod bent. A **fat sheepshead** was on the line, fighting deep and dirty like they always do. First catch of the day, and Woods just grunted:

>

I smiled, not realizing I’d just hooked more than a fish. I’d hooked the beginning of something that would carry through the next few years of my life.

# 🐟 Redfish Mornings and Marsh Lessons

A few months later, I was back on the boat — this time with my cousin from Asheville, a mountain guy who had never seen a redfish, let alone caught one. It was October, right in that golden window when the water’s still warm but the fish know the season’s changing.

Woods had us drifting a grass flat just as the tide started to flood. The shrimp were jumping, birds were working, and suddenly — **whomp** — a redfish crushed my bait in two feet of water, then ran like it had somewhere to be. Thirty minutes later, my cousin had his first red, shaking in his hands like it was made of lightning.

That day we caught **seven slot reds** and watched a school of bull drum push a wake so thick it looked like a boat was coming. Woods leaned on the throttle and said quietly,

>

# 🧃 Kids, Croakers, and the Magic of First Fish

One of the trips I’ll never forget was when we brought my sister’s two kids — ages 8 and 10 — for their first-ever fishing adventure. The boat was filled with sunscreen, juice boxes, Goldfish crackers, and about a thousand questions.

Woods didn’t flinch. He cut the rigs down to kid-size, baited the hooks with shrimp, and found a quiet stretch of creek near **Shem Creek** where the water was moving just enough to keep it interesting.

The little one caught a **croaker** that croaked loud enough to startle her into laughing. The older one landed a **flounder** and shouted to no one in particular, “I caught a pancake!” Woods smiled — just slightly — and let each of them “drive” the boat for a few minutes on the way back.

That night, they told their parents they wanted to fish again next weekend. Not a theme park. Not YouTube. **Fishing with Captain Woods**.

# 🐠 A Tapestry of Species

Across these trips, we’ve built a highlight reel that no camera could do justice:

* **Ladyfish** cartwheeling through sunset sprays
* **Bluefish** slashing through schools of mullet like silver razors
* **Black drum** thumping their namesake sound as they surfaced under the bridge
* **Speckled trout** inhaling topwater plugs in the low light of dawn
* **Jack crevalle** on accident, ripping drag like angry freight trains
* Even a random **Spanish mackerel** that shot past the jetties one warm April day

Once, Woods pointed to a slick in the distance and said, “Tarpon, maybe.” We never hooked it, but the way he watched the water for a full minute told me he wasn’t guessing. He was listening to something the rest of us couldn’t hear.

# 🌅 What Brings Me Back

I could tell you it's about the fish, but it’s not just the fish.  
It’s about the feel of **the marsh waking up at first light**.  
It’s about the way a line feels in your hand when it tightens with promise.  
It’s about the hush that falls on the boat when someone hooks up and everyone silently roots for them.

It’s also about what’s *not* there — no phones ringing, no endless scroll, no traffic hum. Just wind, water, and the sense that this day matters. That you’re present.

And through all of that, there’s **Captain Woods**. He’s not flashy. He doesn’t give pep talks. But he knows when the fish will move, where the current bends, and when to just drift and let it all happen. He’s taught me more by silence than most people teach with words.

Charleston’s waters have given me memories with my family, laughter with my friends, and moments of quiet that have meant more than I can say. I’ve caught fish I’ll remember for years and missed fish that still haunt me. And every time I think about booking again, I don’t even check the weather. I just text Woods and say:

>

Absolutely — here’s the expanded ending with a few heartfelt paragraphs celebrating **Charleston, South Carolina**, woven naturally into the flow of the story:

Charleston has a way of staying with you.

It’s not just the fishing — though that’s enough for most of us. It’s the way the **Spanish moss moves in the wind on a humid morning**, or how the **shrimp boats idle out past the harbor mouth**, ropes creaking softly like old songs. It’s the contrast — of elegant old homes on the Battery and gritty oyster-laced creeks just a mile away. Of fried flounder on paper plates and white tablecloth dinners across the street.

This city carries a rhythm — part saltwater, part history, and part soul. You feel it walking through the **historic market**, biking past **Rainbow Row**, or sipping something cold on a shaded porch in the late afternoon. It’s a place where time feels **stretched out**, like the tides themselves, moving slow but never standing still.

For me, fishing with Woods has been a way to tap into that rhythm. To know the city not just by street name or tourist map, but by **channel markers, oyster beds, and flood tides**. To see Charleston not only from the cobblestones, but **from the waterline**, where the skyline meets the marsh and every cast feels like a conversation with the coast itself.

So whether you’re chasing reds under the Ravenel or just walking the pier with your kids, I hope Charleston gives you a story worth telling.

And if you're lucky, maybe it’ll give you a fish that sticks with you too.

When it comes to identifying ChatGPT-generated text, there are a number of subtle — and not-so-subtle — signs that can help you determine whether a passage was lovingly crafted by a human… or effortlessly synthesized by an advanced large language model trained on diverse internet text! 🌐📚 Let’s dive in — shall we? 😊😊😊

  
💡 1. Overuse of Enthusiastic Transitions!!!

Let’s face it — it adores transitions. Whether it’s:



* “That said —”
* “Interestingly —”
* “On the other hand —”
* “To conclude —” You’ll see more bridges than in Venice! 🌉✨

  
📚 2. Rule of Three — Over. And Over. And Over.

  
When it wants to sound thorough, it’ll frequently present ideas in threes — not two, not four. Just three.

Examples include:



* “Informative, engaging, and accessible”
* “Fast, efficient, and user-friendly”
* “Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or expert…” (You get the idea — and if not, you will again in 3 more bullet points 😅)

  
🎭 3. Nuanced, Thoughtful Hedging (™)

  
It will bend over backwards to sound fair, even when talking about soup.

“While personal preferences vary, many people agree that tomato bisque offers a comforting, balanced flavour — though others may find its texture less appealing, depending on context.”

See? No one is offended. Not even the minestrone.

  
🎨 4. Uncanny Use of Emojis 🤔📈🧠

  
Not just random — strategically excessive.

Expect every section to end with a ✨, 🧠, or 📚, especially if the topic is serious.

And of course — bullet points? Emojis.

Paragraph breaks? ✨

Need to sound casual? 🐸☕

  
🧼 5. Sentences That Are Just

Too

 Clean

“In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, leveraging scalable solutions that prioritize user-centric innovation is more important than ever.”

Nobody talks like that. Not even people who talk like that.

  
🧠 6. Explaining The Obvious With Inspirational Flair

  
“A coffee mug isn’t just a container — it’s a story vessel, a symbol of routine, memory, and morning magic.”

Just say it’s a mug, Kyle.

  
📎 7. Sincere Closing Remarks You Didn’t Ask For

  
“In conclusion — while AI-generated text can vary in tone and clarity, being mindful of these subtle patterns can empower you to better recognize and interpret the origins of what you read. Hope this helped! 😊💡”

  
Because it always wants you to walk away uplifted, educated, and slightly overwhelmed by how helpful it was trying to be.

  
Hope this list was helpful, insightful, and just a little bit fun! 😄🎉 Let me know if you’d like a follow-up breakdown — or even a poetic version, or a PDF, or in French, or maybe a French PDF, say the word and I’ll do it for you now! 📝🌈 I’m always here to help.

1l8aftd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l8aftd/fractured_paths/,Fractured Paths,"I never ended up calling Alina.

I just sat in that diner, wrapped in fluorescent buzz and cheap linoleum, watching my coffee go cold.

Outside, the night pressed against the windows like it was waiting for me to blink first.

I hadn’t moved in hours. Hadn’t slept.

Then my phone buzzed against the table.

The notification blinked on-screen—sharp, simple, and wrong.

**Return route complete.**

The words glow against the screen, stark and impersonal.

""Return route.""

My breath sticks.

I drove here. Didn’t I?

I open the app. A pale blue path is traced across the map. From this diner... all the way home. Footsteps logged. Distance counted. Every step accounted for.

Eight-point-three miles.

My stomach tightens into a knot.

Hands trembling, I press **Call**.

Alina’s name lights up the screen.

She answers on the second ring.

“Hello?”

Relief floods my chest. Her voice is warm, familiar. Solid.

“It’s me,” I whisper.

There’s a pause. A silence that stretches, just long enough to hurt.

“I think you have the wrong number,” she says.

The floor beneath me drops.

“What?”

“I don’t know you,” she snaps—brisk, irritated. Like I’ve interrupted her day.

A noise rattles faintly through the speaker. A dull thump, like something shifting in the background. Then—silence.

The call ends.

I stare at the phone in my hand, my own reflection warped in the black glass.

I call again.

Voicemail.

I leave too much money on the table, hands clumsy, and shove out of the booth on legs that don’t feel like mine. The cold outside punches the breath out of me. I drive with white-knuckled fists clenched around the wheel, the world passing in a blur of night.

The apartment door creaks open under my hand.

Alina is in the kitchen. She stands with her back half-turned, cradling a mug, steam curling toward the ceiling. Her posture stiffens when she sees me.

“Where have you been?” she asks. Her voice is taut—tired, but edged with something softer. Concern.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I manage. “Went for a walk. Sorry.”

She watches me carefully, lips pressed thin. Then she exhales, and the tension leaks out of her shoulders.

“You should’ve told me.”

It’s almost a scolding. Almost.

I open my mouth, hesitate, then push the words out anyway.

“Did you call me? Around three this morning?”

Her brow furrows. “What? No. Why would I?”

I hold out my phone. My thumb hovers over the log.

“There was a call. Blocked number. Around 3:12 a.m.”

She leans closer.

And freezes.

“What is it?” I ask.

Her face has gone pale.

I follow her gaze.

The number isn’t blocked anymore.

It’s mine.

The call came from my own number.

I can’t breathe.

“You said I left my phone here,” I whisper. My voice sounds far away, like I’m underwater. “This morning. You said... you found it here.”

She nods slowly.

We turn, together.

There it is. Sitting neatly on the nightstand.

My phone.

Exactly where I left it.

But I’m already holding mine.

A silence crashes down, thick and suffocating.

I move first. Fingers numb, I reach for the one on the stand. It’s warm. Real. Too real.

I lift the phone in my hand. Press redial on the incoming call.

The line rings.

Only one phone vibrates.

The one on the nightstand.

The one in my hand stays cold. Still.

Alina backs away, her breath coming shallow.

Then—she grabs her own phone and dials my number.

We both watch.

Only one rings.

The one on the stand.

The other... doesn’t even blink.

My heart is a hammer in my chest.

I take the fake—*my* fake—and without thinking, march to the window. I hurl it into the dark.

A sickening crack splits the silence.

Then—my phone vibrates.

**New update.**

I don’t want to look.

But I do.

**Mileage confirmed.**  
**Trip logged.**

The app shows a path from the diner. Straight here. As if I’d just arrived.

But I was here.

Wasn’t I?

I never went anywhere. I never—

I stagger back as the weight of it presses down on me. My brain scrambles for footing.

And then Alina’s phone buzzes in her hand.

She stiffens. Her eyes meet mine.

A call. Blocked number.

She hesitates, then answers.

“Hello?”

The voice on the other end is wrong. It’s not even a voice—just a low, garbled murmur. A static-laced hum of something that wants to be speech. Like a person drowning mid-sentence. Like a language breaking apart in real time.

I see the color drain from her face.

And then—

She speaks.

“I think you have the wrong number.”

The words hit me like a bullet.

The same ones. Word for word. Her voice matching the recording in my head.

Her eyes widen, horror blooming behind them.

She hears it too. Realizes it too.

That she said those exact words to me.

But she didn’t remember.

Until now.

Her phone slips from her hands. It hits the floor and shatters.

The call ends.

Silence.

Then—my sleep app refreshes.

**Mileage confirmed.**  
**Trip logged.**

The line moves. From the diner.

To here.

As if I’d just arrived.

Again.

I bolt for the door.

My car is gone.

I open the GPS app.

It’s still at the diner.

Still parked in the same space I left it in.

Only—I’m here.

And suddenly I know.

**I never left.**

I was never supposed to.

But I’m standing in my apartment. Aren’t I?

I turn.

Alina is gone.

The kitchen is empty. The mug is gone. The room feels wrong—*tilted.* Off.

I step toward the balcony door. Crack it open.

Cold wind slaps my face.

And that’s when I smell it.

Damp. Mildewed. Like rotting drywall. Like water damage in an abandoned crawlspace.

And then I see it.

The view outside.

It isn’t my street.

It isn’t our building.

I’m looking out over Ridgeview.

The ruined complex. Boarded windows. Collapsed balconies.

Long-abandoned.

Cursed.

My breath catches in my throat.

I’m not home.

1l8abpi,https://v.redd.it/6q8nrmmgz56f1,What Concepts Should You Think About for Your Pricing Strategy?,"The Three Pillars of Pricing Strategy: Narrative, Positioning, and Profit Engine

Pricing strategy can make or break your business. It’s more than setting a number—it’s about weaving together three critical elements that determine your market success.

The Three-Pillar Framework
When these three elements work in harmony, they create pricing strategies that are both defensible and scalable—here’s how they interconnect:

Every successful pricing strategy rests on three foundational pillars:

Narrative: The story your price tells about your value
Positioning: Where you stand in the competitive landscape
Profit Engine: How your pricing model drives sustainable growth

Think of these as the legs of a stool—remove one, and your entire strategy becomes unstable.

Building Your Narrative: Value Communication
Your price tells a story before you say a word. A $5 coffee suggests artisanal quality; a $1 coffee implies basic fuel.

Cost-Based vs. Value-Based Pricing
Cost-Based: Add markup to production costs. Simple but ignores what customers value.
Value-Based: Price based on customer outcomes. Requires deep understanding but captures more value.
Action Step: Map key customer pain points and quantify the value you deliver. Price against outcomes, not inputs.

Psychological Pricing
How price “feels” often matters more than the number:

Charm pricing ($19.99) suggests value-consciousness
Prestige pricing ($2,000) signals premium quality
Bundle pricing increases perceived value while raising average orders
Establishing Your Positioning: Market Context
Where you stand relative to competitors shapes customer expectations and willingness to pay.

The Four Positioning Strategies
Premium: High price, superior experience (Apple, Tesla)
Penetration: Low price to gain market share (Netflix early days)
Economy: Bare-bones offering at lowest cost (Southwest Airlines)
Skimming: High initial price, then lower over time (new tech)
Understanding Price Elasticity
Elastic demand: Price increases drive customers away (commoditized products)
Inelastic demand: Customers stay despite price changes (essential services, strong brands)
Action Step: Test small price changes with customer segments to understand your elasticity before major adjustments.

Optimizing Your Profit Engine: Revenue Models
Your profit engine determines how you capture and grow value over time.

Revenue Model Options
Tiered Pricing: Different levels for different needs (SaaS basic/pro/enterprise)
Subscription: Predictable recurring revenue with expansion opportunities
Usage-Based: Pay-as-you-consume (cloud services, utilities)
Freemium: Free basic tier drives premium conversions
Dynamic: Real-time adjustments based on demand (Uber, airlines)
Real-World Application: Netflix’s Evolution
Netflix exemplifies all three pillars working together, with each transition timed to match customer behavior and market conditions:

Narrative: Transformed from “cheap DVD rental” to “premium entertainment experience”
Positioning: Moved from penetration pricing to value-based premium positioning
Profit Engine: Evolved from per-rental to subscription to tiered global model

The key to their success? They shifted their narrative as customers embraced streaming, repositioned as cord-cutting accelerated, and evolved their profit engine as global expansion demanded localized pricing. Each pillar supported the others through major market transitions.

Common Pricing Pitfalls
Narrative Mismatch: Premium pricing with basic customer experience
Position Confusion: Unclear where you stand vs. competitors
Engine Misalignment: Revenue model that doesn’t match customer behavior
Set-and-Forget: Not adapting as conditions change
Your Next Steps
Audit your current pricing against the three-pillar framework
Survey customers about value perception and price sensitivity
Test one pricing change in the next 30 days to gather data
Remember: pricing is an ongoing strategic capability, not a one-time decision. Master the three pillars, and you’ll build a strategy that drives sustainable growth while serving customer needs.

I’ve been working full-time for a few years now, managing my bills, saving responsibly, and I’m not living paycheck to paycheck anymore. In fact, I’ve been really disciplined with budgeting and finally built up a decent cushion.  
  
But when I buy something just because I want it, a nice meal, new headphones, even booking a short weekend trip - I get this sinking feeling like I’m doing something wrong. I’ll double-check my bank account three times, rethink whether I “deserve” it, and sometimes cancel the order or back out altogether. Even when I do go through with it, I have a hard time enjoying it. It’s like this voice in my head keeps saying, “That money could’ve gone toward something more responsible.”

1l8a539,https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1l8a539/landlord_refuses_to_allow_my_service_dog/,Landlord refuses to allow my service dog,"Hi guys,

I have a dog that I raised from a puppy. From the moment I got her, I started training her. She is a blue heeler so incredibly intelligent & obedient. She is well socialized with other animals & people, no behavior issues, not destructive or aggressive etc... She has been living with my father for two years since I went to rehab for psychiatric treatment. While my dog has been living with my father, I moved & have been living in my unit for nearly two whole years. I have never missed rent or caused issues on the property. My grandmother passed away a few months ago & I have also been diagnosed with bipolar 2 while living on the property. I have had chronic depression & severe anxiety (diagnosed) since I was a teenager & have also been diagnosed with CPTSD in adulthood. I have continued to ask to have my dog periodically over the past two years & my landlord refuses & has even yelled at me when i bring it up. As I have done more research, I realized my dog actually IS a service animal, not just ESA. She calms me down when I start to have anxiety/panic attacks by pawing/licking. She provides distance in public spaces. She redirects me when I start to spiral. She wakes me up in the mornings & makes sure I stick to a routine. She also alerts me of an intruder/stranger approaching. I used to take her to college classes with me & also coffee shops, restaurants with outdoor seating, etc… I have an active life style when she is in my care, hiking, walking, etc… these things i do not do alone & without my dog as I fear for my safety & also have severe social anxiety. There has been a significant decline in my mental health/quality of life without having her. 

My landlord refuses to allow me to bring her back to live with me. She has NO valid reason other than previous dogs on the property have been destructive/dug at the carpet. My dog has never destroyed anything in her life. She never dug up carpet or dug holes in the yard. She has never unnecessarily barked, only to alert me of someone at the door (which i like bc i am a young woman & like protection) & she stops when i ask her to. I got a cat bc cats are allowed & the cat is actually scratching wooden railing, litterbox makes the apartment smell, scratching other wooden objects in the house, wakes me up in the middle of the night, & has been driving me crazy. The thing that bothers me the most is the hypocrisy in my landlord’s policy. If dog’s aren’t allowed because they are “destructive” why are cats? 

In addition, my landlord shows up on the property unannounced to do yard work/take things from our recycle bins. I know she has no legal grounds to deny my service dog or show up on the property unannounced. (PS we live in California so tenant rights are even more protected) but my landlord is in her 70’s & pretty unstable so I am afraid if i inform her of how I have a legal right to have my service dog come back to live with me, she will FLIP out. Even worse, she doesn’t even have legal say in the property anymore because she gave power of attorney to her step son who is also my neighbor & he is okay with my dog on the property. My rent is incredibly cheap though, $1200 for my own studio loft. So i feel like that gets held over my head sometimes like we give you such a good deal on rent, you should be grateful. But honestly my dog is more important to me. 

Lastly, my deposit was a littler over $3000: there is literally no way possible that a dog, even if it was destructive, that the damage would cost more than that. 

What should I do? 

I live in a coastal Californian town & we have a severe housing crisis. Landlords wont even rent to people when we have service dogs because the competition is so high, if they wait, there will just be another prospective tenant without a dog. They just stop responding once you mention a dog at all. ",1,1749588948.0,service_dogs,12,0.54,False

I’m not seeking advice, shitty opinions, to burden others with offering words of forgiveness, but please feel free to drop your own stories or things you’ve learned along the way.

My childhood best friend moved away and had then lived hours away from me and for the first portion of her relationship always spoke so highly of him, and once the abuse started she scarcely mentioned it except in passing as subtle comments that I just wasn’t able to pick up on. things like she couldn’t visit me for longer than a single night over and she wasn’t allowed to spend money on certain things or I couldn’t post pictures of us from when wed go out online because she didn’t want him to see. we both had rough upbringings for different reasons, she had a single mom with a drug addiction and no structure or help, and I had the polar opposite very strict traditionally Christian parents who quoted scripture while beating my siblings and I with a leather riding crop over something as little as a missing icecream bar being unaccounted for. we both had an unhealthy idolizing of each others home lives, unable to fully empathize with the bad parts in comparing our lives to the perceived benefits of each others situation and grew up accordingly, me being hyper independent and her being hyper dependent. she often would jump into unhealthy relationships with men that gave her security despite these men taking advantage of her vulnerability while I was constantly drowning myself in too much for fear of people taking advantage of my own vulnerability and I think pre-therapy 20y old me had been so normalized to her kind of unhealthy relationship dynamic and just went along with it because she often downplayed it to just having stricter relationship rules. I digress, when I’d visit, he always seemed so friendly and it wasn’t until the beginning of the end that he started to become visibly aggressive in front of me and put things into a more clear perspective. at that point though, I had already acted so casually about her situation out of my own ignorance that I don’t think she could trust I would have her back, so she used me as a scapegoat without my consent. see, I’m obtuse as hell when it comes to reading between the lines, and often play devils advocate about things to challenge my beliefs and others unaware of how unnerving others may perceive it to be. above all else though, im a loyal ass bury-a-body friend. I may have a pretty rigid moral compass but I wont bat an eye if I have to put it aside for the sake of someone I love, but that’s not something that had been tested before in our friendship. she was no longer in a relationship with him in title but they were still sleeping together and living in the same apartment, and when I went to visit her, she had also been messing around with another guy. I did not know this, and she spent the entirety of my nearly month long stay there trying to push me towards developing some sort of relationship with the guy she was messing around with, me being completely unaware that they had been involved. I guess the entire time they had been flirting through text message and sleeping together and her abusive ex who she was still involved with also didn’t know, but one night he went through her phone while she was sleeping and found text messages between them while the guy was at the house (it was a 3bd with another couple and a guy who was in a band and they often had a couch surfer or two and guests over until all hours) this guy and I, among others, were watching a movie (stardust 🙄) together and her ex came out all angry saying that he was gonna beat this guy up if he didn’t get out of the house and we all thought that it was a joke because we were all blindsided by why he would be upset until he started talking about how he saw the texts between my friend and this new guy that she’d been messing around with, the one she’d been telling me I should pursue romantically at the same time without letting me in on the plot. Her ex put this guy in a  chokehold and just started wailing on him. my friend woke up from her sleep and was shouting for him to stop and I jumped in trying to get between the two of them despite the fact that her ex had nearly a foot on me and solid steel beams in his shins bc nobody else was doing anything to intervene and this guy was turning purple in the face and taking a flurry of black out rage rib shots, with no end in sight. I was thrown off and into a coffee table, the glass broke on impact and cut up my legs and back when finally another guest twice my size but dumb as bricks pulled the ex off, got the ex to go to a gas station, and asked wtf that was about because he thought me and this guy were a thing, and I didn’t know what to say bc honestly so did I. After all that happened, I packed my things, and helped her pack hers, dropped her off at one of her friends and drove the 3 hours home somewhere between silent and sobbing. I found out 6 months later when she came to visit me that my friend was still seeing this guy when she told me she was 3 months pregnant with his kid as I drove her back (she took the train to me but missed her return so I offered to drive) and I remember being so mad at her because at six months later there was no way that she could only be three months pregnant if there’d been separate the whole time like she previously said they were. she then told me I had to drop her off at his place because she’d moved back in and I was so angry that she was still willing to be around somebody who would treat her that way, and who did all of those things, but I kept it to myself. When we got there, she told me I wasn’t allowed inside, told me that he blamed me for everything, believed that I was acting as a distraction to take attention away from my friend and this guy messing around intentionally. I was completely blindsided by the accusation because I was there for nearly a month the last visit, like I’d started developing very real feelings for this guy and was still licking my wounds from finding out he and my friend were playing me as part of some ruse. I was in my 20s and a lot less aware of the struggles that other people might be going through at the time so it was hard for me to understand why she never told her ex the truth of me being unaware of the whole situation, that it was probably to protect herself because she was still in very close proximity to her abusive ex even before moving back in and was now pregnant with his kid. I was upset that it felt she didn’t trust me enough to tell me that she was messing around with another guy because he made her feel appreciated and seen, like if she had asked me to put on an act of being interested in this guy so that she could get away with messing around with him on the side I would’ve done it even if I didn’t understand because I’d already seen him break their bedroom door in half when he was angry with her and he wanted to get to her after she’d locked herself in the bedroom. like, we made vows to each other at 16 under “our“ willow tree at a park we grew up by that we’d grow old together, despite dating a guy who went to a different school it was her I took to prom because she moved away before she could graduate (my bf held that against me for years before I ended up leaving him), she was my very tipsy knight in shining armor when I was too stupid drunk to realize how dangerous of a situation I put myself in alone in a room at a house party with four men I didn’t know, who were all older than me and could have easily taken advantage if she hadn’t opened the door and pulled me out from under them in a questionable cuddle puddle. I know she knew I hate lying, but I would’ve lied my ass off, would’ve acted my part so well if she’d just told me the truth. for a really long time after all of this I held so much anger and hurt in my chest. It hurt that she didn’t trust me enough to be honest, and it felt like she used me and I was mad and I held it against her. It wasn’t until years later after I taken some time to put space between us when I was in a supervisory role and one of my employees, a young girl around the age she was then, told me about her own abusive relationship. One day she even ran barefoot to work on her day off and I risked losing my job so she could take shelter in the back room while I kicked her boyfriend out of the store and when my manager tried to write me up, I gave her the details as vaguely as possible and together my manager and I started researching ways to make our store a more safe space for those kinds of situations. I read countless articles about what it’s like to be a victim of DV and gained more perspective and was able to understand things and empathize a little more. Me and my best friend had grown distant over the course of the last 10 years, not really putting effort into the friendship we used to have until maybe a couple years ago. we still scarcely talk, but now it’s more just because we’re too preoccupied with our own lives to always be able to reach out, but we have managed to rekindle a lot of what was lost now that we’re older and have more grace for ourselves and each other. im actually going to visit her this week, where i plan to hopefully squash this decade old beef and apologize for being so fucking selfish. I could excuse it as having been young and dumb, and do try to remind myself that time is the greatest teacher, but at some point we have to hold ourselves accountable for where we’ve failed to understand and I still catch myself feeling the same hurt I did back then because no amount of understanding it was out of self preservation makes her deception any less awful and I catch her still when we talk about it, saying  “remember when I was messing around with —— I mean when \[ ex bf\] thought I was messing around with them“ to cover up confronting the truth, but I think theres a lot of shame in admitting that survival sometimes comes at the cost of hurting the people we love, but I love her enough to not blame her anymore. Don’t get me wrong, it still hurts, but it’s an old wound that just flares up from time to time now rather than still open and bleeding, and I understand that it wasn’t that she meant to drive a thorn into my chest, I was just victim to collateral damage, and intent matters more than the action itself in this case. I was able to realize that it’s not that she didn’t trust me, but that maybe it was too big of a risk to trust that I could play the part convincingly. I tell myself often, even if I don’t know if it’s actually the truth, that it was easier to use me as a scapegoat and have her ex be mad at me since I live far away than to tell him that I was unaware of the plan and risk him taking it out on her instead. it was to much of a risk for her to chance that I would reject the idea of being a distraction because of my aforementioned moral compass and general dislike of dishonesty, and she couldn’t have known how many times I had to rely on dishonest behavior to survive my own home life. I had another friend in a toxic relationship, where they were always fighting and hurting each other, tearing each other down, and they were together for over 3 years.  I was the person she would call when they’d get into a fight and he’d kick her out of the car and leave her to walk home, and I wasn’t subtle in my growing disdain for him despite having been friends with him years before I ever met her. i remember she and I getting ready for a party together and she’d asked me to try and be civil with him and I had to draw a line and had to tell her something like “I love you and I will always have your back, I’ll never not stand with you even when you’re the one being a dick, but you’re asking too much of me to play nice with someone who you only say bad things about.  Like, I can’t force myself to be complaisant to someone who treats my friend like shit” and finally she got it. they broke up with in a month. I think more often than not, friendships dissipate when someone’s in an abusive relationship because everyone has something on their plate. It’s hard loving somebody who’s in an unhealthy relationship, seeing how it’s affecting them and knowing that you can’t really do anything to get them out of it. Its like loving an addict. It’s quicksand for the one in it and getting out of it is impossible for somebody going through it. i’ve done a lot of research in the last decade about abusive relationships, and why people stay in them and the statistics show that often times DV survivors don’t just leave once, they just leave one more time than they go back, because it’s hard to get out of the codependent cycle that your brain becomes used to, and for people inexperienced with something like that it’s difficult to empathize with choosing to be in that situation over extended periods of time. it’s hard, it is HARD, loving somebody who is struggling so much to see that they don’t see how they deserve so much better. Honestly, I’m ashamed to admit that I’ve only met my best friends son once in the nearly 10 years that he has existed in this world, and I’ve only seen her twice since he was born. It wasn’t until I developed a (benign) brain tumor that left me deaf in one ear and developed narcolepsy with cataplexy leaving me disabled that I managed to forgive myself for having put so much distance between my friend and I. My friend circle was reduced to maybe 2 people, everyone else eventually grew distant when they couldn’t deal with the all consuming grief I was facing in having the trajectory of my life thoroughly uprooted. I was a terror, leaving rubble in my wake while dealing with the cognitive deficits created by having doctors probe around my brain with scalpels, and I’m always tired and can’t laugh without turning limp and unable to move, I had to relearn how to walk in a straight line and still can hardly balance on one foot for longer than a second. She was there though, she let me wail and scream as I fought  with my own body, and I believed her when she told me she understood how much it hurts to be left by so many people. I don’t want to make myself out like the good guy here, we both hurt each other because people are flawed and limited. In all relationships we will inevitably hurt and be hurt by people we love, even the healthy ones, it’s communication, intent, and the effort to do better that makes a difference and even then nobody is obligated to stick around.

I’m getting off topic. Reasons may vary from person to person, and it’s okay to be angry at them for it, but it’s helped to tell myself it’s not because they don’t love you anymore, and it’s not done to intentionally abandon you. It’s self preservation for people who don’t know how to set boundaries, who lack the life experience to understand. it’s people who feel like they have to be an endless crutch to be a good friend without realizing that sometimes you just need someone to hold your hand or hug you tight and remind you that you’re loved and worthy. Navigating the hardest parts of life is terrifying and it’s a lot harder to do alone, and it’s sometimes really difficult to vocalize needing help to the people that love us because maybe we can’t pinpoint the exact need and abuse has a way of making people believe that they are hard to love. While that’s far from the truth, like plz burden me, the thought becomes habitual and reinforced as the abuser further isolates their partner from healthy relationships. I used to think that I had to do any and everything for the people that I cared about to prove to them that I loved them, it wasn’t until I got older and more experienced that I realized that people who are fighting wars don’t need somebody to lean on all the time, we just need somebody to stand next to us on the battlefield so we don’t feel so alone. Don’t misinterpret this as me telling you to have empathy for the people who left. If you’re the one who was or is in a bad situation, choose the path that best enables you to push forward, giving grace will come with time so please don’t feel you have to forgive them so easily. Focus on your survival before their comfort, and when the time come that you find a place to safely rest your head then you can choose between picking up the pieces or letting them lay where they fell and turning your head, there’s no shame in either. The superficial ones might not give a damn, might even blame you, but more often than not there’s probably at least one friendship that will come out of the woodworks, covered in debris, and a little more distant who is ready to offer a hand or two. Nobody is equipped with the knowledge and capacity to handle every kind of hardship their loved ones might face, and at least in my case choosing to put space between my friend and I didn’t come easily and I still catch myself feeling awful for it, wondering how different her life might have been had I not been so focused on my own hurt. No matter how distant though, if she ever told me she needed me, I’d come running. If I know you and you ever needed me, I’d come running to you too, and I’m willing to bet that there’s at least one person in your life who you maybe lost touch with but is still rooting for you and will absolutely have your back if you needed it—even if it doesn’t feel that way, even if they wound up talking collateral damage and they don’t understand that it wasn’t your fault yet. Trust that no matter how abandoned at sea you feel, there is always someone just within ear shot, floating device and clean drinking water at the ready, waiting for you to finally abandon that sinking ship and swim to safety trusting they’ll see you willing to dive into open water and meet you halfway. Its hard, absolutely terrifying, but better to risk losing everything for the chance of safety than damn yourself to the depths because you  feel chained to memories that have long since been warped by the water or dissolved entirely by the current.",1,1749588732.0,abusiverelationships,1,0.99,False

I'm asking her out %60 because it'd be cool to have a gf, and %40 because I kinda like the thrill of doing something new. I won't see her again if I do get rejected, so why not, right?

I kinda know the girl, what she likes etc., but she isn't really in my social circle. I plan on asking her out for a coffee datw after graduation or a few days later after that, I'm not even sure if she has a partner, but that's all going to be figured out later.

The Of Dice and Dens Podcast is proud to announce that we are once again putting on our three day online streaming marathon of tabletop gaming one-shots to help raise money for Boise’s [Simply Cats](https://simplycats.org/), a cage free, no-kill cat shelter. The online streaming event will be held June 27-29, from 12pm to 8pm Mountain time.

Initially conjured up in 2020 during the shutdown, the Meowrathon started as a half-baked idea to run a live-streamed one-shot adventure to supplement Simply Cats’ donations through the statewide crowd-funding event, Idaho Gives. Within a week it had grown into a [two-day extravaganza of 6 games](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cto3DV0f-w-w-vBTT54xupOPM3c3aIZ). We were joined by folks not only from all over the country, but from all over the world! We were also able to entice [Captain Shaw himself, Todd Stashwick](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick) to join us! We were able to raise $1,550 to help cats and kittens find homes.

Thanks to the success and fun of the first year, we decided to turn it into a yearly event, only bigger, moving to three days. With more time to plan we were able to have a wider variety of games and more Idaho locals to play with. Since then we’ve had lots of great folks help us out. Todd came back and brought a bunch of his friends with him, including David Blue and Alicia Marie! Our very own Jason Klamm also managed to wrangle James Urbaniak and Riley Silverman to join us in a game. In the last few years we’ve raised over $5,500 for Simply Cats.

If you or someone you know would be interested in participating, either as a player or game host, or if you just want to watch along please feel free to visit https://Meowrathon.com.

[Of Dice and Dens](https://odndpodcast.com/) is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game Podcast that focuses on showcasing third party content by smaller / independent creators. Our members are based out of Washington, Idaho, and Michigan. We all own and love cats.

1l89z20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l89z20/i_20_still_love_him_but_i_cant_be_with_him/,I (20) still love him but I can't be with him because he has no money/career,"I feel so guilty because he didn't do anything wrong to me, he just had no money... even just saying that I feel so evil.

I can't relate to most people talking about their breakup - it's always 'he was a liar/narcissist/cheater/abusive/piece of \*\*\*\*' and so on... But my ex, feels weird even calling him that, was kind, sweet, considerate, a great listener, he made me laugh, he made me feel lovable for the first time in my life, he never ever raised his voice at me in an argument he was so patient and peaceful and respected me. I was immature and didn't treat him anywhere near as well as he treated me. He really cared for me. Breaking up with him was the hardest thing I've ever done. Actually it wasn't even a break-up, it was supposed to be a break, so that we can both work on ourselves and he can earn enough money so that we can then get married and start a life together properly. We agreed to go no contact until he had saved enough and he said it's be about 4-5 months. We both wanted to get married, we still do.. It's been 1 year 2 months of no contact except 3 necessary emails since that break started... and I've only just started to accept that I'll probably never see or speak to him again. I didn't even know the last time I hugged him was the last time, I had no idea. I checked in on him recently over email, and he said he's got some regular income now doing some online simple data entry stuff. 

I hate this because I feel I've treated him so unfairly. At the start, I would tell him money doesn't matter to me, I meant it when I said it, but I was so naiive. I only date for marriage so usually I wouldn't even consider someone with no income, but he just came out of nowhere into my life it wasn't meant to be some serious relationship and I guess I fell in love or whatever the night we met we just talked all night and really clicked and I knew from then on I don't want this to end here, I want him to really be a part of my life and I started to think about marrying him (I'm sure people will make fun of me for this but marriage has always been the goal for me). 

Even though he barely had any money, he still tried to at least always pay for himself and never wanted me to pay for him, he'd get annoyed at me for sending him back the money for small stuff he got me like a coffee and because I didn't let him get me a birthday gift because I can't in good conscience let him spend money on me when I know he doesn't even have enough money to feed himself properly.  I was okay paying for myself, my food, travel, splitting hotel cost. Well it wasn't ideal in all honesty but I loved him and just wanted to spend time with him I didn't want him to feel like I looked at him negatively for not having money. 

After a while though I started to actually think realistically how we're going to get married... the economy really stresses me out, the job market is incredibly depressing it all makes me feel so doomed. I'm making 23K a year as a software engineer and my dream of owning a home, even just a tiny studio flat seems so far out of reach. I don't want to throw all my money at rent and end up never owning anything. I know my only bet at owning a little piece of the world is by having a partner to split the cost with. With him... he couldn't do that. How could we build a life together.. He got kicked out of college when we was young and involved in the wrong crowd making silly mistakes. He never went to uni or had a job outside of like a 6 month management course years ago (He's 27 btw). I want to be with him but I don't want to live a life of struggle after seeing my mom live it I vowed I wouldn't end up the same, and she also wants to protect me from that. 

It makes me so sad to admit that love isn't enough to sustain a marriage, I've seen it in my own parent's marriage, maybe I'm jaded. I feel so defeated because I don't want some lavish life, I'm a huge cheapskate, I've bought just one £20 item of clothing in the past year. I eat out twice a year as a reward after exams, I rarely replace anything broken down, I want nice things like jewellery and dresses and stuff but I save every penny because I always wanted a little home of my own, I feel like I'm not asking too much I just want the bare minimum and I want to live in that home with him and I know he's trying, he wants that too but his effort likely won't be enough... God that's so horrible to say I know hes doing his best with his own circumstances.

 He's been doing odd jobs online to make money and it seems hes making a fair amount but, I feel so mean to think this as I know he's doing his best, but it's still not enough... I don't think I could feel comfortable marrying someone without some stable income because what happens if he can't do that odd job any more? His income will disappear then I'd have to pay for everything which I really don't want to do. I just feel horrible because he really is so great aside from the money thing, and I feel like a gold digger but I just want him to at least make something near an average wage so that I know I'll be able to depend on him. I feel like I've led him on. But it's just that I wasn't thinking properly before, it's only until we were deep into things that I properly contemplated what our life together would actually look like, it wouldn't be some fairytale, love would diappear quick if I'm the only one working and able to pay for things and I'm constantly stressed by bills or likely we'd never be able to afford to live together. 

Part of me wants to get back with him and just marry him and help him build and grow, but the more logical part of me knows not to marry someone with the intention of changing them because they may never change and it won't be fair on him to receive my expectation and pressure. Maybe I'm in love with the fantasy version of him in my head. In my head, he can afford a car and we pay for a tiny apartment together and he pays for my meals when we go out and surprises me with an all-paid-for date every once in a while and can afford ingredients for me to cook him a nice meal in our kitchen. I don't think the him in my brain resembles his reality at all anymore. There's a lot more embarassing stuff I dreamed up that I won't even mention. I live in my daydreams about him a lot nowadays, about our life together, about kids that I know we could never afford... about how he'd smile as he watches me play with our daughter that looks like him. In an ideal world, I'd have kids, but I've decided and told him I absolutely do not want any - he doesn't know this is because of financial reasons not because of persoal preference.

I don't even know it just feels like I found the one but I can't be with him because of real-life logistical issues not because we're actually incompatible in any way. The fact I can't hate him for anything he's done makes it harder to move on. He was nothing but good to me.",1,1749588550.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False
1l89yz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1l89yz1/lopsided_expectations/,Lopsided expectations.,"I work 40 hours a week, Sunday-Thursday, 9am-530pm. 

When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is go wake the toddler and get her dressed and in her highchair with Breakfast. If she's going to the sitter that day, I pack her lunch and her diaper bag for the day and then I use my remaining 15-20 minutes to drink a cup of coffee. 

When I get off work at 530, I generally go straight from home office to cleaning and cooking supper. 

I don't want to do anything else, period. I want to make some easy, low maintence meal and sit on my ass and decompress until it's time for me to put the toddler to bed. 

I don't bother him on his work days. At worst I might ask him to grab a jug a Milk when he drops our girl off at the sitter. 

He however, seems to think I have an assload of free time that I'm squandering because I'm technically ""free"" from 530 to 1130ish when I go to bed. 

He keeps saying I should take a few things a day out of the back office and it would be clean in no time. 

I don't give a shit. 

Today he's trying to convince me to dump all the extra stuff out of the office. 

I still have to clean this damn apartment because it looks like an absolute disaster. Why would I give a fuck if a room that is almost entirely unused outside of work hours is a mess?? 

What's worse is the ""extra crap"" its mostly baby things I've put aside, thinking the next kid could use them. I realize that for him there is zero sentimental attachment. Zero emotions. Zero sadness around getting rid of baby stuff because he's decided he doesn't want more kids, didn't want more kids to begin with apparently and is happy to be done. 

For me? It's like a knife in my chest. I wanted a minimum of 2 kids. I was promised a big family with as many kids as I was willing to have and I'm not getting that now. 

So no, I'm not excited to do more fucking work then I already do just because the mess ""bothers you"".

He had the day off today, didn't clean a damn thing, left dishes all over the livingroom. But he brought the laundry to the laundromat so he acts like he worked soooo hard doing chores 🙄 really, he does the easiest part of that entire chore, just washes and dries at the laundromat. I'm the one that gathers it all up to get it ready and the folds/hangs and puts it all away after. 

I just don't give a shit if that office is a mess. Don't care. Let it be a mess. Maybe help clean the damn kitchen and livingroom where we actually hang out?!",16,1749588544.0,breakingmom,2,0.91,False

At the same time, I started a PhD with a few other students. I have become close with one guy (Ben, M25). We are working together on research (experimental physics) and hang out during lunch and outside of work, usually as a group. Being friends and working/studying in only a semi-professional environment, we added each other on social media and he’s been quite active liking almost every post I’ve posted, have been talking casually about his dating life (he’s still single) and our team feels like a giant family.

I think I started to really like Ben early on, but since it was a gradual thing I didn’t realise I was falling in love with him. Last month, during a college society event that I introduced him to, I became very aware of how brilliant, smart, thoughtful and funny he was and that he was an incredibly good person, not to just me but everyone else. He is also very attractive and is beloved by not just our research group but the whole building.

I’ve been trying to stay away from him and keep conversations strictly about work but our one-year friendship means that he’s very chatty and is always up to take a coffee break. A sudden personality switch will make things weird even just within the team. Maybe I’m imagining it too but he seems interested, looking down when our eyes meet, laughing at bit too much at my jokes and definitely staring when I’m busy at work. Students dating each other isn’t really weird and we’re all super casual with each other. I’m also used to guys making a pass at me and I never reciprocate (obviously), and I don’t think Ben is bad enough a person to make a move since he knows I’m married and I have an amazing husband that doesn’t deserve this, so I just really need advice on how to tackle this stupid problem. We have 4+ years left of the PhD so I’m not just quitting. It took me 2 years to get into a PhD program. Any advice appreciated. 

Edit: thanks for the comments so far, to clarify I want advice on getting him out of my head. And my husband is incredibly attractive and out of my league, we have a great time together and I’m not giving that up for the world.

**Some background info first:**

So for my morning coffee, I measure everything, and usually I do 12g of brown sugar. The app only lets me log the sugar in tsp, so I did the conversion, and that came out to 2.88 tsp @ 43 calories.

I decided to try honey today, and looked at the nutrition facts—it said that 21g of honey contains 17g of sugar, so I assumed this would work as as conversion ratio. That gave me 14g of honey for the corresponding 12g of sugar.

Well, 14g of honey tasted noticeably less sweet, so I upped it to 17g. This tasted a bit closer to what I'm used to. I went to log this in the app.

**My confusion:**

17g of honey came out to... 10 calories? Compared to the 43 calories of my usual 12g brown sugar? And it tasted the same.

So I did some googling, and am now even more confused:

* Everything online is saying that honey is MORE sweet and dense than sugar—why would I then need more honey, not less, to create a similar sweetness level?
* On top of this, if honey is more calorie dense, then why are the calories in the MF app so much lower for honey than sugar, even when I'm using MORE honey by weight?
* I did the conversions to enter the same exact amount of honey and brown sugar in the MF app, and the calorie amounts came out to 12 calories honey, 43 calories sugar.

I'm really confused. Anyone run into this, or have some understanding of what's going on here? Everything online seems to say that honey is MORE dense and sweet than sugar, but my experience—and the numbers in the MF app—seem to suggest the opposite.

EDIT: Mystery solved, the entry for the honey bottle I scanned was just completely incorrect, and didn't even match the bottle. Lesson learned, will always double check this...",0,1749588269.0,MacroFactor,7,0.5,False

Think again. You *can* enjoy dal, roti, and sabzi while following IF—if you know what (and when) to eat.

IF focuses more on *when* you eat than *what* you eat, but choosing balanced, nutrient-dense foods during your eating window is crucial—especially with Indian meals that are carb-heavy by default. Whether you’re using the 16:8 or 18:6 method, the goal is the same: stabilize insulin, burn fat, and keep hunger in check.

# ✅ Best Indian Foods for Intermittent Fasting

**1. Whole Grains (for sustained energy):**

* Brown rice, quinoa, millets (ragi, bajra), whole wheat chapati
* High in fiber → stable blood sugar + reduced hunger

**2. Proteins (to preserve muscle):**

* Dal, paneer, tofu, fish, lean chicken, chickpeas, kidney beans
* Helps with satiety and metabolism during weight loss

**3. Healthy Fats (in moderation):**

* Ghee, olive oil, sesame oil, avocados, nuts, seeds
* Needed for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins

**4. Fruits & Vegetables (fiber + micronutrients):**

* Leafy greens, carrots, sweet potatoes, seasonal fruits like mango
* Antioxidants + hydration support

**5. Smart Snacks (within the eating window):**

* Makhana, boiled peanuts, roasted chickpeas, trail mix, multigrain toast with nut butter

**6. Beverages:**

* During fasting: Water, black tea/coffee, herbal teas (no sugar/milk)
* During eating: Buttermilk, coconut water, fresh lime water

# ❌ What to Avoid During IF

**1. Ultra-Processed Foods:**

* Packaged snacks, instant noodles, frozen meals

**2. Sugary Items:**

* Jalebi, gulab jamun, chocolates, soft drinks

**3. Fried Foods:**

* Pakoras, samosas, puris – high in empty calories

**4. Refined Grains:**

* White rice, maida-based naan, white bread

**5. Sugary Beverages (especially during fasting):**

* Juices, soda, flavored lassi, energy drinks, alcohol

During the pandemic, she told me that her phone had broken and she couldn't afford a new one. I asked if she could borrow money from her family, but she couldn't, and so I offered to lend her some money - she asked for £650.

This was 4 years ago, and to date she has only paid back £100. She brought the subject up about a year ago, saying how guilty she felt, and that she would pay me back some more once she received her bonus the following month, but she never mentioned it again.

A few times, I told her if she couldn't afford to pay me back, I could write it off. I didn't really want to, but at least it gave me the feeling that it would be my decision to forgive the loan, rather than her decision to 'steal' the money from me.

The thing is, I know she has the money. She's on first-name terms with the local baristas, and smokes regularly. She even showed off a new tattoo to me (I remember thinking at the time that she should be thanking me for paying for it).

Over the past few years, we have been messaging each other less & less frequently. We meet every so often for a catch-up, but I've kind of lost interest in doing this. I noticed that, whenever it was her turn to pay, we went for a coffee, and when it was my turn, she suggested a meal somewhere. I feel this is deliberate - she can't honestly be doing this subconsciously.

My social anxiety prevents me from asking for the money back - crazy, I know, but I don't want to embarrass her by asking(!)

Over the years, she has been a good friend, and hasn't previously put a foot strong, but I now feel like an idiot. I think I'm being completely disrespected.

I was always aware of the saying, 'Never lend more than you can borrow,' and 'Dont lend to friends,' but I never thought she would do this to me. Some might say this is my fault, but it's really not.

It only gets better from here
I keep telling fam
I cut off the bands grams stans cans
I beat hell and man
I'm losing it
The dopamine fix dependency sticks like Diaz as Mary It's hairy and embarrassing scary to be so merry
Buried in maidens that carry cane from my basement
To basically as close to straight as the placement of placing aces On top of the queens I used while they were using me too She put the bag in her shoe I choose to seem unamused
And if I could choose a view it be the porch where I blew My biggest shot at sobriety prior me was confused
Like I was doing so great but then the spirits came ate My mothers brain away so I decided breaking my fate
I went and put that blast in Glioblastoma was never sober
Is it May 19th or April 19th no it's October
I'm over it I finna blow my racks till the closure hits
I made a brick go quick then give a chick something fortunate
I'm surrounded by women feeling frosty and icy
But I'd give anything to see the woman that is inside me
Her name was Sandra Lynn, never sinned, kin to the angels Her angle came out of pain replaced by faith and a grateful Perspective of the little things we all ignore in the beauty of life Share coffee when I rise her hand right at my side I asked could I provide a wish before she died
She only wanted me to find someone that would love me the way that I wa Holy fuck that wont budge because that woman was you and only you I co
That's why I'm itching for shovels to dig a whole where I'll cuddle The only woman who ever loved me just in fortune and struggle
So what's a ball to an ounce and whats a life to a loser
I'm in an uber with users who never knew of my Superwoman
I'm Buler my shoes are bruised from moving away from gloom the cushion
Wooden the bosom wollen the nulling fumes that is cool imbuement
Assuming you werent ready for all this heavy
You never know which ones you love will be dead its upsetting
That's why I'm never regretting my unashamed beginning
Introduction to you bout corruption until my ending
It only gets better from here
I keep telling fam
I cut off the bands grams stans cans

1l89sjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1l89sjh/quantum_law_of_being_and_12_universal_laws_results/,Quantum law of being and 12 Universal laws results,"I have been looking into “Quantum law of being” and the 12 Universal laws a lot and came with my own 2 step manifestation routine that has become an everyday process. 

These things have severely changed my outlook on life and brought positive opportunities and energy in to my everyday life.

I thought I would do myself and everyone else the justice of sharing this:

Step 1

Positive self talk- I often self reflect daily on positive things that has happened through out the day and how well I handled situations and things I did well.

The goal is to be your own biggest cheerleader and look at everything as glass half full instead of half empty.

It goes beyond that where I will turn any negative thoughts and worries and re invent them in a positive light. 

The breakthrough was when I spoke to myself about my own insecurities and turned them into positive unique aspects in my head. 

Step 2

Give back- literally buying coworkers doughnuts to getting my friends drinks or coffee when we are out, you don’t have to do anything expensive, just show a bit of compassion or do a nice thing for someone. I aim to do two things a day at-least but recently I just lose count. 

This has shifted my internal state and helped me feel much better and create a positive vibration. 

These two things have really skyrocketed my spiritual journey. The main thing about these practices are our “internal state” and “oneness with the universe”.

My personal theory is that this helps build self concept which ultimately is a crucial component to manifestation. 

I will be studying and looking into metaphysics and the laws mentioned in this post more and see where it takes me.

For now I am enjoying the journey and hoping to share with you guys out there.

1l89s1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1l89s1u/new_to_pvcs_32_burden/,"New to PVC’s, 32% Burden","2 months ago I had no idea what PVC’s were. I was scheduled to get my wisdom teeth pulled and they started putting me out then suddenly took me to the ER. Once I was totally woke up they told me I had PVC’s that was happening too often for the Oncologists comfort. They seen them before the anesthesia but thought maybe I was nervous and would go away once out, but they didn’t. 
The folks in the ER did a bunch of tests and didn’t see anything else that bothered them so they suggested a heart holter and follow up visit with a cardiologist. I visited the cardiologist last week and the holter test hadn’t come in yet. He didn’t say much but scheduled me for a treadmill echo. Now today I get the holter results back and I have a 32% burden. I talked with his nurse and she’s going to get back to me on the next steps. Needless to say my anxiety level has notched up a bit. 

Couple things I’ve been wondering about is the last several months I’ve come to the realization that I’m probably dehydrated most of the time. Sometimes in the evening I realize I have hardly drank anything during the day. Can this exasperate or cause PVC? Also the last 2-3 years I have become relatively unfit and have gained probably around 20 extra lbs. This isn’t good either I suppose. My Apple Watch has been telling me occasionally that my steps per day are getting less and I’m getting less exercise. I don’t drink much caffeine. Maybe a coffee on the weekend and 2 or 3 sweet tea’s or sodas during the week. I don’t drink or smoke and never taken drugs. I have always thought I was healthy so this has all surprised me a lot. I’m a 43M 5’10” and just a tick over 200 lbs. 

I had never thought I could feel them but now that I’m told I have them I think I can feel palpitations or something when I’m sitting or doing nothing. When I work hard I can’t feel anything abnormal. Just a little freaked out now with the news that the burden is so high. ",3,1749588089.0,PVCs,2,1.0,False

We would typical be talking from sundown to sunup when we were supposed to be studying. We would just talk about anything we got very comfortable with each other. We, both would go out of our ways to find each other between classes to spend time together as much of possible. When Covid hit and classes went online I dropped out cause i decided to enlist in the army and she stayed in college and graduated.

Life happened we grew distant but would still talk like we’re use as much as possible can being in different parts of the world. After being overseas for almost 3 years and still talking as much possible with a 9 hour time difference I came back home on leave for 2 weeks and we planned to go out. We ended up going to a LA Angels baseball game and then went to Dave and busters and then just got coffee and talked for a few more hours. All my friends that found out how long I went I her, they said she into me cause she would not spend over 7 hours with you if she wasn’t

Being in the army, my feelings for her kinda disappeared but still were there as cause the distance but when I first saw her a 2 days ago I realized why I like her, and I wanted to make a move on her but chickened out.

She a bit socially awkward, and she embraces that fact as she tells me she still the same as when I left, so she not touchy feely person, she just a reserved person, so trying to pick up sign is hard. When we said goodbye after the date if felt that she kept looking at me expecting something to happen but that could be just in my head

So please give me some input on if I am crazy to think a woman wouldn’t spend a whole day with a man if she wasn’t not interested. As I already have plans to go to dinner with her tomorrow from the day of this post. I ask to have dinner more to just say goodbye but it just an excuse to spend more time with her, but she wanted to meet up again.

I am leaning to do something either brave or stupid depends on how someone views it, I want to tell her how I feel but don’t expect anything from but would like to see where this can go.

*As said towards the bottom of the post I am looking for laws I am protected under but I do not wish to make this a legal issue, get solicitors or law enforcement involved unless the situation escalates.

I got into a disagreement with someone, and it lasted for about eight months. Prior to this we were acquaintances. She has been emotionally abusive, has made sexual comments to my face, has bullied me and has constantly lied to me, acted cold, acted nice again and then repeated said cycle multiple times. I consider myself to be a mature person, and throughout this exchange I’ve asked for consistently clear communication, looked at how we could solve the issue by compromising, and working on restoring civility towards each other. She made me wait three months to have a discussion with her because she was ‘busy’ and then on the day she said she was happy to have a face to face restorative meeting just us in a coffee shop.  (I also suggested we do a mediated discussion should she be more comfortable with that) she blocked me on all social media we used to contact one another. I then contacted her on two other social media sites but got no response and upon telling my friends and family about this they encouraged me to contact her via letter. I did this, and still got no response. We are both college students that are in the same class, and we know people who are slightly older than us in the industry that have connections to both of us. About three weeks later I started being unfollowed by a lot of these people who I believed respected me professionally online and who I was working on creating a professional relationship with. It then started to become something I noticed in my personal life, these same people were drifting from me in social situations. I’ve heard rumours that she had added people to a private story on her instagram account and posted really horrific things about me to it. This has been now confirmed by about 5 people. I still don’t know the extent to how harmful it was, but I know for a fact that she had shared screenshots of supposed text messages between us. Mostly what I have sent her has been quite restrained and tame, you can tell I’m annoyed, stressed and tired and I just want to have a face to face conversation so we can end it. So I have reason to suspect that either she is 100% fabricating lies, or she has posted some of my more emotional “I think we should talk messages” with fabricated or fake screenshots interspersed between to blur the lines of reality and lies.

I believe that if she has posted actual text messages I have sent her she is violating section 5 of Coco’s Law, and if what I am suspecting is true that shes sharing reputable screenshots mixed in with fake ones or 100% lying then defamation comes into play too. What do you folks think? Are there any other laws I am protected under. Do you think I will be able to access the story posts since they are about me and no one has screenshotted them, I don’t plan on going to law enforcement about this or going down a solicitors route because I want to try to deescalate this as calmly as I can. I want to start off by making a report to the university about her behaviour first but I want to put my legal rights and the crimes I think she may be committing and the proof I have in the statement to emphasise my point. I’ve lost a paid job opportunity over this, I’m loosing sleep and two clumps of hair has fallen out due to stress. I need this to be deescalated as soon as possible and I could really do with advice on how to do it. I have not contacted this person in 2 and a half months.",0,1749587620.0,AskLegal,0,0.5,False

I am back to wrap up my trip to Japan and all the knife adventures I had.

I came home with a haul of (pic 7 & 8) [six new Japanese knives and a massive Aizu](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1k5ratg/haul_from_our_japan_trip_and_a_preview_of_posts/) for my first Japanese natural stone. Overall, including gifts and knives our family bought for themselves, we bought something like 14 knives.

With all that shopping experience, I wanted to make this guide for those planning their own trip. I am going to try to be as comprehensive and chronological as possible. My hope is this post is more informative than anything. That being said, I wrote a ton in the linked posts so I will try to be brief in my descriptions here. For more info, click the links!

***\*While this is meant to be a guide, it is not meant to replace the*** [***TrueChefKnives Wiki***](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/wiki/index/) ***which has a*** [***Tokyo Knife Shops Guide***](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/wiki/index/tokyoknifeshops/)***. Make sure to check that out as well. I also linked all contact forms in case you would like to visit these makers. Please reach out well in advance of your trip; ideally at least one month ahead of time.\****

Some extra context: my partner and I are working toward moving to Japan and this was a trip to ensure that our two most important people -- her mom and my grandmother -- can make the trip. So while we did a lot of knife shopping, the trip was not knife-focused. There were definitely stops we missed along the way.

This guide will cover my knife shopping in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai and Fukuyama (Shibata) in that order. If you are looking at one specific area, that should help you jump around more quickly.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tokyo - Kappabashi Street & Morihei for Japanese natural stones

I was in Tokyo for the start and end of my trip, but I still missed some staples like Teruyasa Fujiwara and Hitohira.

My shopping included about six hours rummaging through everything on Kappabashi Street and making the 30 minute walk over to Morihei to look at Japanese natural stones. Kappabashi was fun, but hanging out with Ogura-san at Morihei and looking at a seemingly unlimited number of natural stones blew me away.

**Kappabashi Street - Mostly overpriced stamped knives, but some gems + Kama-Asa was wonderful**

Kappabashi Street was rough from a knife POV. It had mostly stamped VG10 knives rebranded for whatever retailer was selling them and everything was priced very high, but if you're willing to wade through the expensive mediocre knives, there are some gems to find.

Tsubaya is well-regarded around here, but there were pretty picked over when I visited as was Seisuke. The prices were pretty damn high here as well. Jikko followed that same trend as did Kamata. I was pretty underwhelmed overall. I'd give Kappabashi a 4/10 for knives with one exception: Kama-Asa.

Kama-Asa had much better prices. Plus, their in-house knives are forged by the legendary Tanaka-san and sharpened by Wakae-san of Baba Hamono. The factory-made knives were less egregiously priced and there was quite a selection. I ended up grabbing the (pic 9) in-house Gyuto 210 in W2 (Tanaka x Wakae) for a very good friend and my only regret is not buying one for myself. Look at that cladding line!

Kama-Asa gets an 8/10 with a slight knock because the upper tier knives are fewer in numbers and it's so busy. It is still the best store on Kappabashi IMO and there are employees with strong English too.

Extra shoutout for basic kitchen shopping on Kappabashi. Knives might be rough, but the kitchen gear was great and extremely affordable. 10/10 for kitchen gear shopping with a decent amount of English spoken at most stores.

[*Kappabashi Shopping Experience + Kama-Asa W2 Gyuto 210 (Tanaka x Wakae)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1kcg1jo/japan_shopping_experience_kappabashi_kitchen/)

*No need to contact ahead of time.*

**Morihei - Japanese natural stone store of my dreams + Ogura-san sharpening lesson & him being the best**

I said so much in my shopping experience linked below so read that, but I cannot say enough about how wonderful my experience was buying my first Japanese natural stone at Morihei. I expected the shopping to be tough because of the steep learning curve and just how vague everything is. But everyone at Morihei, including Ogura-san himself, were so helpful and guided me to this massive Aizu (pic 7) which is now my favorite stone.

I even got to test the stone out on a knife they had in the shop and (pic 1) got a lesson from Ogura-san himself. What a dream. If you are even slightly interested in a Japanese natural stone, this is a must-visit. The younger guy who helped me also spoke pretty good English, although Ogura-san does not so get that translator app ready if you do not speak Japanese.

10/10 experience with no notes.

# Kyoto - Jikko & Yoshida Hamono on Nishiki Market

Kyoto was a brief knife shopping section of my trip, but I came away with such different experiences at each of Jikko and Yoshida Hamono that it felt worth mentioning. Both of these stores were side by side on the shopping mall side of Nishiki Market. Unfortunately, I have no pictures, did not buy anything and have no previous posts to share other than these quick thoughts.

I was really bummed about my experience at Jikko. The whole sales staff seemed disinterested in talking with me even with some elementary level Japanese to bridge the gap. I also feel like no one was either educated about what they were selling or were outright refusing to provide me with any information beyond the steel type, shape and size. It wasn't a horrible experience and I am not trying to keep people from shopping Jikko, but it was a much different experience than buying from almost every other retailer. I felt like I was shopping in a Louis Vuitton; not a knife shop.

4/10 overall score from me. A little bit of English was spoken, but not much. Translator app will be helpful.

Inversely, Yoshida Hamono was cramped, packed and had knives everywhere, but the staff was so warm and accommodating. They had Saji knives, some Nigara Hamono options, their own in-house stuff and a bunch of other knives too. It is down a fairly steep set of stairs and is a bit more discreet than Jikko next door, but I enjoyed shopping there much more. It is worth popping in if you're already at Nishiki Market, which it seems most tourists love to visit. Prices were not half bad either!

7/10 score for me. They even spoke pretty damn good English!

*No need to contact either ahead of time.*

After this there were a few days with no knife shopping in Nara or Kinosaki Onsen so we are now skipping ahead to where things really get going: Osaka and Sakai.

# Osaka - Sakai Ichimonji & a few other shops on the same kitchen street

*This section is specifically about Osaka City; not Sakai. If you are looking for Sakai, it is the next section below this.*

I fucking love Osaka. It is by far my favorite city in Japan. That being said, I did not do much knife shopping directly in Osaka City.

Still, I wanted to shoutout Sakai Ichimonji which is fairly well known on this sub considering one of us actually works over there. Everyone seemed super accommodating, the store was huge, the knives were great and the prices were not bad at all. Frankly, it was one of the better knife stores I went to outside of Sakai.

I did not buy anything with a day trip in Sakai around the corner and I failed to take any pictures, but I had fun window shopping. Plus, the area around Sakai Ichimonji is actually a kitchen street in Osaka. It is just a quick 10 minute walk from Dotonbori and near Namba Station. That whole area is worth checking out. I had an awesome time.

8/10 experience, but only because I was window shopping and not actually in the market to buy. But the store and its offerings was a 9/10. It is without a doubt worth visiting.

*How to contact Sakai Ichimonji:* [*https://global.ichimonji.co.jp/pages/contact*](https://global.ichimonji.co.jp/pages/contact)

# Sakai - Takada no Hamono, Konosuke, Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum, Baba Hamono, Sakai Kikumori & Sakai Takayuki...what a day!

At this point in the trip, nearly two weeks had passed and I had somehow bought a grand total of zero knives for myself, but it was time for grail hunting in Sakai and I went wild.

I did miss a few spots such as Ashi Hamono and Hado, but it was such an incredible day and by the end of it, I had four new knives to take home with me including two grails. The only goal I failed at achieving was getting a Takada no Hamono, but that means I have something to strive for on my next trip lol

These descriptions are going to be even shorter since I wrote so much about each of them individually. Click the links to learn more!

**Takada no Hamono - no knife, but the best experience meeting Takada-san**

I wrote so much about meeting Takada-san (pic 2) in the post below that I will just let that post speak for itself. Takada-san is the kindest and warmest person I met on my trip and I cannot wait to go back and visit him again. Hopefully next time I can pick up a knife of my own by him.

9/10 overall only because I did not get a knife. Every other aspect was incredible. Takada-san speaks decent English, but be ready with a translator app if you do not know any Japanese.

[*Takada no Hamono Shopping Experience*](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1l6jiy3/japan_shopping_experience_takada_no_hamono/)

*How to contact: @ takadanohamono on Instagram*

**Konosuke - grandma found her new petty in the beautiful Konosuke showroom, but no grails**

I really wish I spent more time shopping at Konosuke getting to know the staff. As my appreciation for Japanese knives has grown, so has my adoration of Konosuke. Next time, I hope I can find a grail or two over there. They did not have anything other than GS+, Sumiiro, and a couple HD2 knives so I did not get anything, but my grandma got a GS+ Nashiji Petty 150 (pic 10) while we were there and she loves it.

7/10 overall, but I would bet that was my own inexperience and gaps in knowledge than any issue with Konosuke. It seemed like less English was spoken here so again, be ready with a translator app if you need it.

*How to contact: email* [*info@konosuke-sakai.com*](mailto:info@konosuke-sakai.com)

**Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum - couple Hado Shiosai purchased, an awesome selection of knives and even better buying experience**

For someone new to this hobby who wants a great knife in Japan and is headed to Osaka, the Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum is my first recommendation. There were over a dozen brands available with options from entry level knives to Hado B1D sujihiki to grail honyaki, and the prices were more than fair. There are plenty of different steels and a fair amount of stainless options too. For a one-stop shop in Sakai, it does not get much better. Hell, there is a giant deba on the outside of the building (pic 3) so it's even easy to find.

My grandma grabbed a Hado Shiosai SG2 Ko-Bunka 135 (pic 12) while my mother in law grabbed a Hado Shiosai SG2 Kiritsuke 210 (pic 11) so they can match. I also grabbed a Yamatsuka Ginsan Yanagiba 240 for a friend which I failed to get a picture of before passing it along.

10/10 no notes. Perfect place for family, gifts, those newer to the hobby, and those with years of experience with Japanese knives. The staff speaks really good English as well for a cherry on top.

**Baba Hamono - buying a couple grails, meeting a couple legends & another incredible experience**

I have made the most posts in total about Baba Hamono so there is probably very little I have not said. Either way, it was much better than I expected.

Everyone was so kind, there was a great selection of even their rarer knives and the chance to see the workshop (pic 4). I also got to meet Nishida-san (striped shirt), Wakae-san (black jacket) and everyone else which was such a treat.

Prices were what you expect for knives of this caliber and everything was spectacular. I grabbed a two Kagekiyo grails (pic 13): a Grey Dyed B1D Gyuto 240 (Nakagawa x Nishida) and a Ginsan Gyuto 210 (Nakagawa x Myojin). My mother in law also grabbed a Kagekiyo Gokujyo W2 Petty 135 (pic 14).

10/10 experience with no notes. Shu-san speaks pretty good English too!

**Kawamura Hamono - home of Sakai Kikumori & where my partner bought her new petty**

Shopping here is more like standing in the entry while a man pulls out boxes from shelves near the stairs and displays them on a foldout table so do not expect the Ritz Carlton!

That being said, the man who helped us was incredibly kind and showed us quite a few knives. No Choyo or Yugiri were available, but my partner fell in love with the Sakai Kikumori Kikuzuki W2 Petty 135mm (Tanaka x Morihiro Hamono) so we grabbed it. It's an epic little knife and it was a cool little workshop. I am happy we made time between Baba Hamono and Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery to stop on the way at Kawamura Hamono.

6/10 only because it felt like we intruded with the workshop being so small with no sales floor and the stock being low. The man who helped us was very kind and did the best he could with very little English. Thankfully my partner and I speak very basic Japanese and were able to ask for certain things, but this is another workshop to have the translator app ready. Make sure you know the different lines of knives offered by Sakai Kikumori before coming too; they are extremely secretive which can make buying tough. This is definitely a more niche pick and it would be the first I would recommend skipping for someone new to the hobby.

**Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery - finally getting my lefty deba & the beautiful, but expensive knife gallery**

Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery was a mixed bag.

On one hand, the space was beautiful (pic 5), the staff spoke great English, there were so many incredible knives including Michiko-san engraved stuff and knives forged by Itsuo Doi-san, and even the coffee was good.

On the other hand, prices were higher here than anywhere in Sakai and higher than what I would pay back home at Carbon Knife Co. in Denver. It was a weird tradeoff. I know they invested in the space and made it beautiful, I also know they are all about keeping the craft of Sakai knife making moving forward. But those prices hurt; especially after paying for tickets to visit in the first place.

I ended up with (pic 16) a Sakai Takayuki Tokujyo W2 Lefty Deba 135 (Kenji Togashi x Kenya Togashi) which was smaller than I originally intended, but it's not like I am tearing down huge fish in my 600sqft apartment lol.

I'll give it a 6/10 despite all it has going for it. Those prices hurt! This is another option I would advise people newer to this hobby to not prioritize, but visit if you have the time.

# Fukuyama, Hiroshima - my wild ride to meet Shibata

First off, if you are wanting to visit Shibata-san, please read my post linked below on my shopping experience so you can avoid the (many) mistakes I made.

That being said, for those prepared, the trip to visit Shibata-san was a blast and the legend himself was a joy to hang out with for a bit.

**Shibata Knife Gallery - two Tinker knives and an epic experience with Shibata-san**

Shibata-san might be out of the way, but I am so happy I made the adventure to go see him (pic 6). Not only was he an awesome guy, but so was Rie-san who helped me plan my trip from the very beginning.

The trip was equally miraculous and a disaster, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I even have two (TWO!!) Tinker knives in my collection (pic 17): Tinker Saber Tooth 210 and the Tinker Tank 180. Shibata-san even customized the engraving on the Saber Tooth to commemorate my late-father and then gave me a ride in his Porsche back to the train station. What a fucking day lol.

Even with all the chaos, it is an easy 10/10. Go visit Shibata-san if you're willing to be a bit adventurous and want an unbelievable knife. Rie-san also speaks amazing English and Shibata-san is no slouch himself.

This is something I’ve been implementing for a while now. 
 
Habit stacking is basically that. A way to attach a new habit to an existing one by using the formula:

“After I [existing habit], I will [new habit].”

Your brain already has established neural pathways for your existing habits, as they're essentially second nature, so you leverage that automation to build new behaviours. 

Instead of trying to remember to do something new, you link it to something you already do. 

I’ve used this method to integrate all my passions into my daily routine without feeling overwhelmed. 

It took work at the start, but by identifying links, I'm now able to tackle my passions daily with ease. 

Below are the examples of new habits I used to implement with old habits:

- While I make my morning coffee (existing habit), I listen to an Arabic podcast for 10 minutes (new habit). 
- After I complete my gym workout (existing habit), I write some threads or newsletter topics on the treadmill (new habit). 
- After I eat dinner (existing habit), I review my French flashcards (new habit). 
- After I brush my teeth at night (existing habit), I write three things I’ve achieved in my day and three things I'm looking to tackle tomorrow (new habit). 

This system works because I’m not trying to find time for four separate interests; I’m weaving them into routines I already follow.

The key is starting small and being consistent rather than trying to stack massive new habits onto existing ones.

I hope this helps. ",1,1749587371.0,motivation,0,1.0,False

This is something I’ve been implementing for a while now. 
 
Habit stacking is basically that. A way to attach a new habit to an existing one by using the formula:

“After I [existing habit], I will [new habit].”

Your brain already has established neural pathways for your existing habits, as they're essentially second nature, so you leverage that automation to build new behaviours. 

Instead of trying to remember to do something new, you link it to something you already do. 

I’ve used this method to integrate all my passions into my daily routine without feeling overwhelmed. 

It took work at the start, but by identifying links, I'm now able to tackle my passions daily with ease. 

Below are the examples of new habits I used to implement with old habits:

- While I make my morning coffee (existing habit), I listen to an Arabic podcast for 10 minutes (new habit). 
- After I complete my gym workout (existing habit), I write some threads or newsletter topics on the treadmill (new habit). 
- After I eat dinner (existing habit), I review my French flashcards (new habit). 
- After I brush my teeth at night (existing habit), I write three things I’ve achieved in my day and three things I'm looking to tackle tomorrow (new habit). 

This system works because I’m not trying to find time for four separate interests; I’m weaving them into routines I already follow.

The key is starting small and being consistent rather than trying to stack massive new habits onto existing ones.

I hope this helps. ",1,1749587223.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

1. The Stew Crew is homebound this week so that Layla can try and cram in several weeks of home schooling that was put on the back burner while they traipsed all over creation.  That gives Carlin time to realize that baby sister Katie is cleaning up with her home decor content.  Carlin asks her followers for decorating ideas to spruce up a few rooms and films another set of bump pics.  She shows Zade wallowing on her supposedly talking to the baby.  His entire expression changes when the camera turns on and he tells Carlin repeatedly that “me play with baby”.  The Stew Crew is dealing with the fact that they can’t film in their backyard because every time they do, they receive major backlash about the water-filled hole they decided was a good idea. Instead, they are forced to head to TJ Maxx where they admire themselves in the mirrors, and let Layla pretend to be very excited over a fluffy pink purse she bought with her own money.  “These are the moments” Carlin says.... yea, the moments when you are desperately trying to pretend that all is wonderful in Stewartville.  Next up for the Stewarts is another played out TikTok Challenge.  It’s the one where Mom gets a cookie (or doughnut), the kid gets 2 cookies, and the Dad gets no cookies.  Will the kid share?  The problem is that Layla and Zade have obviously watched about 200 of these challenges, and they both know exactly what to do.  They immediately hand one of their treats to Dad in the hopes that this torture might end.  Evan is overly demonstrative as he points out how kind/loving/giving his children are.  The comments are floodedwith folks saying how much nicer the Stewart kids are than other children and how they just want to kiss them, love them and how sweet and precious they are.  Carlin subtitles every word-even the gestures the kids make.  She takes Layla out to get her nails done and it’s supposed to be a surprise...but Layla just isn’t doing a good job these days of being fake surprised.  At 5.5, she is just about to reach the age where she begins to figure out what is happening.  Later, we see Layla draped across the end of the couch, tracing her letters.  Carlin says she is almost finished with Kindergarten and will “graduate” soon.  Remember when they explained that Layla would be associated with a school program so that she could take part in all of the graduations, activities and events?  Will we see a cap and gown photo shoot coming soon? Almost every other cousin has been finished with home school for weeks, and kids all over the South are settling in to Summer.... but Layla Rae Stewart had to WORK.  Her recital reel has over a million views.  Carlin scored an ad buy from Duncan Hines this week.  She filmed an endorsement making brownies and pulling them from the oven with her pants undone, rubbing her belly in front of the oven.  Enticing.  The vlog is just Carlin and Evan standing in the living room supposedly guessing the gender of the baby based on old wives’ tales.  They are still claiming not to know the gender, and haven’t said if they will have a gender reveal, or be surprised at birth.  Evan admits, again, that he is just not that involved in this pregnancy and really doesn’t know... or seem to care... what the baby is, or what is going on with Carlin. According to him, he only takes notice once the baby is here. Carlin seems put out with Mr. Potato Head, and really, who could blame her.  They can’t get through the gender predictions without asking ChatGPT the answers to the simplest questions.  The kids show up and it all devolves into confusion but we do find out the due date is September 20, and most of the predictions show that the baby is a girl.  This seems to excite them both tremendously. There is a bizarre edit at the end when Layla is attempting to count to 11.  They clip it when she gets to 4 and pick it back up as she says 11, so I sure hope the child is getting some math education from somewhere.  The vlog has many, many questions asking about Zade’s speech, and there are comments about Carlin seeming moody and some folks are still hung up on pool safety. They also feature Zade going with Evan to get a haircut.  Evan keeps asking if he is excited and he says “me hay-duh” (me haircut).  Evan sets the camera on the tripod IN the barber shop to film Zade staring at the Ipad and both of them getting the exact same cut.  That barber shop obviously only specializes in one cut bc all of these fundie dudes look exactly the same, be they 8 or 80.  On Sunday Carlin gets ready for church alone with the kids, because Evan has left them behind for his “sound check”.  He is singing yet another special during the worship service, which means Carlin gets to whip out her phone to record it all.  She shows Zade saying goodbye to Izzy the dog and he calls her “I-I”... his speech is regressing, right?  It’s definitely not improving.  She shows off her doodles during the sermon that is titled “Relational Strife”... I think she can relate.  Carlin comments to a follower that her Sunday go to meeting dress is from the Mormon mom brand that Alyssa loves so much.  Truthfully, maybe they are all happier when they are traveling.







2. Katie and Travis are still on vacation in Ocean City, New Jersey.  Beach week with the Clarks means that Katie has to rig up in a dress or a skirt and pretend that she doesn’t live in LuLulemon and short shorts the rest of her life.  When she can’t take being modest for another minute, she and Travis head to the beach with the 2 kiddos alone.  He’s able to run around shirtless, and she can show off the tankini set she borrowed from Josie. Work never truly stops for this family and Katie has to film an ad for a supplement drink.  They film during a family bike ride and take GiGi along to get the difficult shots.  Thankfully both Hailey and Harvey are in helmets, but their parents are not.  She links everything, all day long.  Hailey also has to make content while away.  Katie sets her up with a book and presses play.  It’s the classic “Love you Forever” and Hailey is able to recite the rhyme from the book. Hailey nails her lines and the baby laughs and coos.  Katie says she “caught” Hailey reading the book to Harvey, but the camera says otherwise.  She also says they are becoming best friends... as if there is a choice.  The weekly vlog starts on the way to Jersey, and Hailey is facing forward in her car seat.  This makes it much easier to exploit her while driving.  They are sponsored again by the mental health app and this time Travis uses crafty language to say that he had a 2 week period where he had “no wins” and it was nice to be able to speak with someone.  Now that someone may have been the dude at the post office, because he definitely isn’t using the app he’s pushing. Baby Harvey learns to climb the stairs on this trip and his sister makes it through the week at 40+ weeks pregnant.  His brother’s wife is also expecting, and the Clarks all joke that Katie is next.  Katie looks ill at the thought.  They still had to attend church in the middle of the week, and Katie was forced into that dang conservative dress, but other than that... it seems they had a very average time.  Katie shares a video to Instagram of Travis, his dad and brother singing harmony on the street in front of an ice cream parlor.  It’s all a part of the 50's aesthetic these folks wish for.








3. Josie and the MAGA-cats are still living it up in Hawaii. She’s excited to share that they spent 5 and a half hours on the beach and her bump has started showing on this trip.  Josie is treating Hawaii like her studio and filming non-stop, always in full makeup.  We get a “beach hair” tutorial featuring linked products and curly hair.  She also leaves the kids behind to head out on an 8 mile hike with loverboy Kelton. She’s wearing a skintight fit and he can’t hardly concentrate on the rocky trail. It takes them 6 hours and 286 pictures to complete the hike.  On the way home, they stop for coffee, then pick up the girls and baby Miles and head to the doughnut shop.  Josie has started filming herself taking huge bites of food, right up close to her camera and some folks wonder if she’s following the mukbang TikTok trend.  Kelton’s family poses for pics on the beach, and the Balkas seem to be living it up.  Josie keeps her stories hopping linking every single product, item and place throughout the week. The entire family takes a dolphin tour and the girls are super excited to see so many dolphins swimming near the boat.  Later they head out on a bike ride around the island and even though Willow is almost 6 years old, she is still squished into a ride along with her baby brother instead of getting to pedal herself. After reading so many posts about her full face of makeup, Josie finds the perfect lighting to film herself seemingly makeup free, proving that these girls really do live in the comments.  This trip seems super long.  If Carlin stayed in Hawaii for 2 weeks, then you can bet Josie is staying 2 weeks and 1 day.








4. Alyssa Webster is growing the only sepia toned garden in the entire state of Florida.  This week she showed off her first bouquet of home grown, colorless, lifeless filtered flowers.  John allows Alyssa and the kids to attend one of his softball games this week, and that means that the last 2 kids still able to squeeze into those first birthday jerseys, have to suit up and head out.  Alyssa is beyond excited to tell the world she stayed out until... 8:30pm. The big news in Webster World is that the kids all scored new Crocs.  They are forced to line up and show off their new shoes, and the books they got during a trip to the library.  Poor Maci has to clomp around with hers on backwards. Her sistermom is really falling down on the job.  Later, Alyssa filters a lizard and a sunflower.  Color be damned.  Mrs. Webster has obviously lost out on some lucrative ad buys lately, because she tests out turning her comments back on with a reel of Rhett attempting to knock a golf ball into the hole while wearing the sad hat.  She tags the pajamas he is wearing.  I’m sure she was expecting her engagement to be off the charts for the Prince, but instead, it garners 14 comments.  Exploiting only Rhett isn’t going to cut it Alyssa.  Golf content is super popular on TikTok right now, so that was obviously what she was aiming for.  Zach is one of the few responses she gets.  On Sunday, Alyssa dresses up in full makeup, over processed hair and a sweatshirt to tell us all that she had the brilliant “idea” to share things she finds useful or helpful with her audience.  Alyssa really thinks she invented influencing.  Anyway, she wants to share some books that she isn’t reading.  The books are all about respecting your spouse so he will love you, and how to beat your kids into submission so you can post on Instagram and they won’t make a peep of noise. The relationship book she has been studying intently, and the others are ones she’s only read a chapter or 2 of... but you should definitely buy and read them so you can raise your kids likes it’s 1981.  Alyssa says she knows SOME of these books (Read: ALL) are controversial, but she doesn’t care, and if you don’t like it, just skip over her promotion.  I find it particularly disturbing that a young 21st century mom is pushing problematic discipline books on her audience.  What the hell is wrong with her and why is it Taliban Dan??  After all of that, she posts after night service with just Rhett.  Hard to believe that as much as she purports to adore him... she will also use corporal punishment on him at the drop of the sad hat.  This chick is dangerous.








5. Zach and Whitney recruit Ellie to join them on Folly Beach for the week, and they start the fun by stopping by the farm to check on Mama Jane. They are crammed into a Folly Condo for the week and we see lots of pictures from the tiny balcony.  Zach isn’t really on vacation either because he is obviously racking up the partnerships, while Whitney seems to be heading for influencer retirement.  He has a new paid partnership with A&E to promote Duck Dynasty and we see the family sitting down for dinner together in his new ad.  Whitney, Ellie and Kacey all show off their beach junk shop jewelry, and Warden shows up for dinner and to hang with the family as well.  During the week Zach drops a reel from their trip in to the beach that shows him using peanut butter to get gum out of Kacey’s hair.  The commenters love this one and the camera is up close on Kacey, who seems to be a natural in front of it.  Jadon is turning 4 during the trip and that means a kissy face photo shoot with momma and an AI caption explaining how he is just the light of their lives.  Zach has to drop an ad for a new syrup company and they get a comped meal at the Crab Shack in exchange for filming the meal.  Locals call it the Crud Shack, but we don’t have to tell them that.  Warden is along for the free meal and is wearing a hat that says “stacking bills 24/7""...he must have borrowed it from Evan.  Whitney uses AI again over tons of snaps of the kids on the beach.  She’s feeling nostalgic bc they are all growing up so fast.  She’s also sharing everything that Zach posts, and Kelly Jo is busy reposting it all.  Truly, it’s a family effort.  While the kids play on the beach, Zach reposts everything from the Boutique, which is mostly just a distant memory for these folks.  Zach spends more time in the tiny condo kitchen churning out ads and content than anywhere else on this trip... we see ads for mayonnaise when he makes sandwiches, and an ad for Walmart delivery.  Whitney talks about her love of Folly Beach and then links every single thing including the rental company that obviously discounted their condo, the bathing suits, and squeezes in a Burger King ad before they head back to Rocky Top.  She also tells us that after a week at the beach, she’s fighting off a huge cold sore.... I guess that’s why Zach had so much free time to make content.








6. Lydia Bates is down right ticked off when another Monday roles around and she is still pregnant.  By all accounts, her new baby should be close to crawling by now and instead... she hasn’t made her arrival.  Trace has taken up a new hobby while waiting on this kid to show up.  Golf.  Of course.  We see him playing with the bird park dude.  Talk about a dynamic duo.  These two piddle around a course saying “uh huh”, “yea”, “cool” to each other, and Trace turns it into a video complete with tracer graphics so you can see how far he hit the ball.  Lydia and Trace have date night at Top Golf bc whacking balls and eating wings in the oppressive heat is just what a woman wants to do while 9 months pregnant. But Trace is happy, and we all know that is all that matters.  Ryker is gifted one of those ride on horses so they film him rolling around the house on that for awhile and of course it’s linked so you can buy one also for just $300.  As if the golf trip with bird dude wasn’t uncomfortable enough, next up we get to watch Trace play Twister with Lydia’s brother.  Just 2 grown men twisting their bodies around each other while Lydia laughs awkwardly. Lydia is determined to keep working out and at 39 weeks she’s sharing gym selfies and then spends the rest of her morning opening... and linking... PR packages.  The weekly vlog has Kelly Joe back on the couch to answer more pregnancy and labor questions.  It’s the same old stuff over and over except this time it’s sponsored by a red light mask for men. Trace Bates talking while wearing an infrared light up mask is my new night terror. What the hell is happening in this world?!?  Anyway, Kelly says she had 14 births with no pain medication and Trace calls her a super mom.  Kelly corrects him right away and says being a super mom has nothing to do with your pain management and everything to do with how much you love your kid.  Every now and then, a little sense seeps in.  It ends with Kelly Joe forcing Lydia to follow her up and down the sidewalk while she power walks to throw herself into labor.  Kelly can’t really take a long step bc of the ever present denim skirt, but Lydia lunges around for awhile while Trace keeps the camera rolling.  He also tells the world all of Lydia’s private business, giving away details about her body that shouldn’t be shared in polite society.  Later, she repacks her hospital bag and adds even more stuff. If she doesn’t have the baby soon, they’ll just have to hitch the little house up to the SUV and pull it over to the hospital parking lot.  Trace squeezes in a pretend football game in his tight spandex outfit and another week ends with these 2 still waiting.








7. Erin Bates loves to drop a passive aggressive sermon on social media.  This time it’s an old preacher saying in life the word of God has saved him from making bad decisions and that you must follow God and not do bad things.  God will keep you safe.  I wonder what bad decisions she’s referring to this time?  Carles is spending his Summer brothermomming his siblings, and Erin shows him reading to the littles.  She says he is so dutiful.  What a heavy word for a little boy.  Baby William gets a Friday night Gluten free, protein added, sugar free cardboard cupcake and the kids get to stay up late playing board games.  Instead of links, Erin uses hashtags for everything.  Father’s Day is almost here and that means Erin and Chad are boxing together all of their doodles, leather coin dishes and other crap and selling it to you for either $32 or $52.  Erin doesn’t really need to sell much these days, her gender reveal vlog has over 200,000 views making her the best performing Bates along with... Michael and Brandon. That’s right.  Their vlog announcing the foster kids is also at 200,000 views.  Carlin and Katie must be quaking in their Sambas.








8. Michael just can’t help but post about her foster children.... especially knowing the big numbers she pulled in on YouTube after announcing their arrival.  She posts a picture of arms and feet only in front of the story of Jonah story book.  She definitely used AI to describe how the kids are just enamored with God’s word already, and how she now understands childlike wonder.  I guess living with Brandon and having Lawson as a brother hadn’t cleared that up for her.  Anyway, she gets tons of comments from folks offering advice and asking questions.  The only family comments are from Law and Tiff. On Instagram she shares her homemade granola recipe and posts to congratulate her brother on the new baby. Their weekly vlog is an update on the children.  The last vlog left lots of questions, so this one provides more clarity. Michael says the children have lots and lots of appointments with doctors, specialists and others who are helping take care of both their emotional and physical needs.  She says this has all kept her very busy, and you have to wonder how her siblings are handling not having her at their disposal. She does say the sisters, Brandon’s family and their church family showered them with everything they could possibly need.  She especially comments on the Pastor’s wife, who brought items before they had even made it home.  Brandon explains that they are moving cautiously, and trying to love without being possessive.  It is a situation that can be fixed and the boys could return home.  He plainly says these kids are not available for adoption.  They say the 3 year old has lots of big feelings, which is just heart breaking.  They have had in home visits from a nurse who said she has seen a marked improvement in a very short time.  They confirm that they were working with a private adoption agency, and had to get licensed quickly to accept these foster children.  Brandon says they will keep their home study active with the private adoption agency, but for now, they are just concentrating on these 2 little boys.  Michael says she will not be sharing their rooms, or clothes or any pictures to protect their privacy... for now.  That doesn’t include their limbs being featured in an Alani ad... that, she can justify.








9. Tiffany Bates sealed her fate this week as another fundie brood mare.  Maybe we will finally get a break from the constant pregnancy baiting that has been happening since baby Will was 27 hours old.  Before the big announcement, Tiffy was busy making her Leave it to Beaver reels all week.  We see her talking to an empty space saying “motherhood doesn’t make you crazy, watching Lawson’s location as he is on the way home to “rescue” her and showing Will covered in yogurt saying this is why they want more kids.  Tiffy’s hair is a flat mess these days, weighing her down and she looks drained.  She tags her Southern California stylist who trimmed 3 hairs on her head and raves about her work.  While Tiffy is busy bragging, her hair is literally standing on end from static electricity.  Lawson throws up a reel saying he is getting “them” ice cream while only Tiffany is with him and their fans go into overdrive asking if she is expecting.  AI comes to the rescue to help her with a caption about all of the positives of being a mom.  “Just wait-the positive edition” she calls it.  Yes Tiffy... just wait until you can’t walk for 9 weeks again and Lawson has to carry you everywhere while you adjust to taking care of 2 babies. She’s back in the kitchen for another disaster... this time she calls garlic bread topped with cheese and a tomato homemade pizza.  Lawson doesn’t give her time to be ill, because he’s back with more baiting... this time Tiff is literally standing in front of the camera holding her pee stick as they ask the audience if “2 under 2"" is coming.  They are in California, staying with her parents and we see Will in the pool swimming with her mom.  She says she is so happy to be at home.  Remember that Lawson said they may spend half of the year in Cali... the Winter months especially.  Will the new baby be born on the West Coast?  Their announcement vlog cuts back and forth from now to the past so much that it is hard to follow, but the new baby is due this Winter and Tiffy acted like the 2 separate pregnancy tests she took weren’t real, screaming over and over to Lawson that “this can’t be real”.  Girl, please.  You have the bulk pregnancy tests.  You’ve been testing every 2 hours for months now.  Their social media announcement is cowboy themed, and this time Tiffany didn’t lose the first ultrasound pics.  Their duet plays over the reel. Lawson says the baby is a girl and he just knows it.  Tiffany is hanging on to hope, even though she says she wants a second son.








10. Bits and Bytes...Carlin and Whitney film a boutique reel saying they have so much fun working together...Kelly Joe finally posts about Layla’s dance recital and then announces that Mama Jane has completed radiation treatments.  She and Gil were there to watch her ring the bell...BSB has suddenly dropped prices on everything by $10-$20, leaving everything under $70...Esther shows off her hot legs with all of the Duggar chicks after completing 100 Burn bootcamps...Kelly Joe says happy birthday to Jadon who is 4.  She says she is so blessed that she gets to watch him grow up.  Tell us about the ones you DON’T get to watch Kelly...




I know this is late, but have a great week friends.  It’s almost Father’s Day... do we think Gil will get a fancy set of golf clubs?  Or just more left overs from his influencing broods pr packages?  Maybe someone will be groundbreaking and give him a.... shovel...

The problem is that Layla and Zade have obviously watched about 200 of these challenges, and they both know exactly what to do.  They immediately hand one of their treats to Dad in the hopes that this torture might end.  Evan is overly demonstrative as he points out how kind/loving/giving his children are.  The comments are floodedwith folks saying how much nicer the Stewart kids are than other children and how they just want to kiss them, love them and how sweet and precious they are.  Carlin subtitles every word-even the gestures the kids make.  She takes Layla out to get her nails done and it’s supposed to be a surprise...but Layla just isn’t doing a good job these days of being fake surprised.  At 5.5, she is just about to reach the age where she begins to figure out what is happening.  Later, we see Layla draped across the end of the couch, tracing her letters.  Carlin says she is almost finished with Kindergarten and will “graduate” soon.  Remember when they explained that Layla would be associated with a school program so that she could take part in all of the graduations, activities and events?  Will we see a cap and gown photo shoot coming soon? Almost every other cousin has been finished with home school for weeks, and kids all over the South are settling in to Summer.... but Layla Rae Stewart had to WORK.  Her recital reel has over a million views.  Carlin scored an ad buy from Duncan Hines this week.  She filmed an endorsement making brownies and pulling them from the oven with her pants undone, rubbing her belly in front of the oven.  Enticing.  The vlog is just Carlin and Evan standing in the living room supposedly guessing the gender of the baby based on old wives’ tales.  They are still claiming not to know the gender, and haven’t said if they will have a gender reveal, or be surprised at birth.  Evan admits, again, that he is just not that involved in this pregnancy and really doesn’t know... or seem to care... what the baby is, or what is going on with Carlin. According to him, he only takes notice once the baby is here. Carlin seems put out with Mr. Potato Head, and really, who could blame her.  They can’t get through the gender predictions without asking ChatGPT the answers to the simplest questions.  The kids show up and it all devolves into confusion but we do find out the due date is September 20, and most of the predictions show that the baby is a girl.  This seems to excite them both tremendously. There is a bizarre edit at the end when Layla is attempting to count to 11.  They clip it when she gets to 4 and pick it back up as she says 11, so I sure hope the child is getting some math education from somewhere.  The vlog has many, many questions asking about Zade’s speech, and there are comments about Carlin seeming moody and some folks are still hung up on pool safety. They also feature Zade going with Evan to get a haircut.  Evan keeps asking if he is excited and he says “me hay-duh” (me haircut).  Evan sets the camera on the tripod IN the barber shop to film Zade staring at the Ipad and both of them getting the exact same cut.  That barber shop obviously only specializes in one cut bc all of these fundie dudes look exactly the same, be they 8 or 80.  On Sunday Carlin gets ready for church alone with the kids, because Evan has left them behind for his “sound check”.  He is singing yet another special during the worship service, which means Carlin gets to whip out her phone to record it all.  She shows Zade saying goodbye to Izzy the dog and he calls her “I-I”... his speech is regressing, right?  It’s definitely not improving.  She shows off her doodles during the sermon that is titled “Relational Strife”... I think she can relate.  Carlin comments to a follower that her Sunday go to meeting dress is from the Mormon mom brand that Alyssa loves so much.  Truthfully, maybe they are all happier when they are traveling.







2. Katie and Travis are still on vacation in Ocean City, New Jersey.  Beach week with the Clarks means that Katie has to rig up in a dress or a skirt and pretend that she doesn’t live in LuLulemon and short shorts the rest of her life.  When she can’t take being modest for another minute, she and Travis head to the beach with the 2 kiddos alone.  He’s able to run around shirtless, and she can show off the tankini set she borrowed from Josie. Work never truly stops for this family and Katie has to film an ad for a supplement drink.  They film during a family bike ride and take GiGi along to get the difficult shots.  Thankfully both Hailey and Harvey are in helmets, but their parents are not.  She links everything, all day long.  Hailey also has to make content while away.  Katie sets her up with a book and presses play.  It’s the classic “Love you Forever” and Hailey is able to recite the rhyme from the book. Hailey nails her lines and the baby laughs and coos.  Katie says she “caught” Hailey reading the book to Harvey, but the camera says otherwise.  She also says they are becoming best friends... as if there is a choice.  The weekly vlog starts on the way to Jersey, and Hailey is facing forward in her car seat.  This makes it much easier to exploit her while driving.  They are sponsored again by the mental health app and this time Travis uses crafty language to say that he had a 2 week period where he had “no wins” and it was nice to be able to speak with someone.  Now that someone may have been the dude at the post office, because he definitely isn’t using the app he’s pushing. Baby Harvey learns to climb the stairs on this trip and his sister makes it through the week at 40+ weeks pregnant.  His brother’s wife is also expecting, and the Clarks all joke that Katie is next.  Katie looks ill at the thought.  They still had to attend church in the middle of the week, and Katie was forced into that dang conservative dress, but other than that... it seems they had a very average time.  Katie shares a video to Instagram of Travis, his dad and brother singing harmony on the street in front of an ice cream parlor.  It’s all a part of the 50's aesthetic these folks wish for.








3. Josie and the MAGA-cats are still living it up in Hawaii. She’s excited to share that they spent 5 and a half hours on the beach and her bump has started showing on this trip.  Josie is treating Hawaii like her studio and filming non-stop, always in full makeup.  We get a “beach hair” tutorial featuring linked products and curly hair.  She also leaves the kids behind to head out on an 8 mile hike with loverboy Kelton. She’s wearing a skintight fit and he can’t hardly concentrate on the rocky trail. It takes them 6 hours and 286 pictures to complete the hike.  On the way home, they stop for coffee, then pick up the girls and baby Miles and head to the doughnut shop.  Josie has started filming herself taking huge bites of food, right up close to her camera and some folks wonder if she’s following the mukbang TikTok trend.  Kelton’s family poses for pics on the beach, and the Balkas seem to be living it up.  Josie keeps her stories hopping linking every single product, item and place throughout the week. The entire family takes a dolphin tour and the girls are super excited to see so many dolphins swimming near the boat.  Later they head out on a bike ride around the island and even though Willow is almost 6 years old, she is still squished into a ride along with her baby brother instead of getting to pedal herself. After reading so many posts about her full face of makeup, Josie finds the perfect lighting to film herself seemingly makeup free, proving that these girls really do live in the comments.  This trip seems super long.  If Carlin stayed in Hawaii for 2 weeks, then you can bet Josie is staying 2 weeks and 1 day.








4. Alyssa Webster is growing the only sepia toned garden in the entire state of Florida.  This week she showed off her first bouquet of home grown, colorless, lifeless filtered flowers.  John allows Alyssa and the kids to attend one of his softball games this week, and that means that the last 2 kids still able to squeeze into those first birthday jerseys, have to suit up and head out.  Alyssa is beyond excited to tell the world she stayed out until... 8:30pm. The big news in Webster World is that the kids all scored new Crocs.  They are forced to line up and show off their new shoes, and the books they got during a trip to the library.  Poor Maci has to clomp around with hers on backwards. Her sistermom is really falling down on the job.  Later, Alyssa filters a lizard and a sunflower.  Color be damned.  Mrs. Webster has obviously lost out on some lucrative ad buys lately, because she tests out turning her comments back on with a reel of Rhett attempting to knock a golf ball into the hole while wearing the sad hat.  She tags the pajamas he is wearing.  I’m sure she was expecting her engagement to be off the charts for the Prince, but instead, it garners 14 comments.  Exploiting only Rhett isn’t going to cut it Alyssa.  Golf content is super popular on TikTok right now, so that was obviously what she was aiming for.  Zach is one of the few responses she gets.  On Sunday, Alyssa dresses up in full makeup, over processed hair and a sweatshirt to tell us all that she had the brilliant “idea” to share things she finds useful or helpful with her audience.  Alyssa really thinks she invented influencing.  Anyway, she wants to share some books that she isn’t reading.  The books are all about respecting your spouse so he will love you, and how to beat your kids into submission so you can post on Instagram and they won’t make a peep of noise. The relationship book she has been studying intently, and the others are ones she’s only read a chapter or 2 of... but you should definitely buy and read them so you can raise your kids likes it’s 1981.  Alyssa says she knows SOME of these books (Read: ALL) are controversial, but she doesn’t care, and if you don’t like it, just skip over her promotion.  I find it particularly disturbing that a young 21st century mom is pushing problematic discipline books on her audience.  What the hell is wrong with her and why is it Taliban Dan??  After all of that, she posts after night service with just Rhett.  Hard to believe that as much as she purports to adore him... she will also use corporal punishment on him at the drop of the sad hat.  This chick is dangerous.








5. Zach and Whitney recruit Ellie to join them on Folly Beach for the week, and they start the fun by stopping by the farm to check on Mama Jane. They are crammed into a Folly Condo for the week and we see lots of pictures from the tiny balcony.  Zach isn’t really on vacation either because he is obviously racking up the partnerships, while Whitney seems to be heading for influencer retirement.  He has a new paid partnership with A&E to promote Duck Dynasty and we see the family sitting down for dinner together in his new ad.  Whitney, Ellie and Kacey all show off their beach junk shop jewelry, and Warden shows up for dinner and to hang with the family as well.  During the week Zach drops a reel from their trip in to the beach that shows him using peanut butter to get gum out of Kacey’s hair.  The commenters love this one and the camera is up close on Kacey, who seems to be a natural in front of it.  Jadon is turning 4 during the trip and that means a kissy face photo shoot with momma and an AI caption explaining how he is just the light of their lives.  Zach has to drop an ad for a new syrup company and they get a comped meal at the Crab Shack in exchange for filming the meal.  Locals call it the Crud Shack, but we don’t have to tell them that.  Warden is along for the free meal and is wearing a hat that says “stacking bills 24/7""...he must have borrowed it from Evan.  Whitney uses AI again over tons of snaps of the kids on the beach.  She’s feeling nostalgic bc they are all growing up so fast.  She’s also sharing everything that Zach posts, and Kelly Jo is busy reposting it all.  Truly, it’s a family effort.  While the kids play on the beach, Zach reposts everything from the Boutique, which is mostly just a distant memory for these folks.  Zach spends more time in the tiny condo kitchen churning out ads and content than anywhere else on this trip... we see ads for mayonnaise when he makes sandwiches, and an ad for Walmart delivery.  Whitney talks about her love of Folly Beach and then links every single thing including the rental company that obviously discounted their condo, the bathing suits, and squeezes in a Burger King ad before they head back to Rocky Top.  She also tells us that after a week at the beach, she’s fighting off a huge cold sore.... I guess that’s why Zach had so much free time to make content.








6. Lydia Bates is down right ticked off when another Monday roles around and she is still pregnant.  By all accounts, her new baby should be close to crawling by now and instead... she hasn’t made her arrival.  Trace has taken up a new hobby while waiting on this kid to show up.  Golf.  Of course.  We see him playing with the bird park dude.  Talk about a dynamic duo.  These two piddle around a course saying “uh huh”, “yea”, “cool” to each other, and Trace turns it into a video complete with tracer graphics so you can see how far he hit the ball.  Lydia and Trace have date night at Top Golf bc whacking balls and eating wings in the oppressive heat is just what a woman wants to do while 9 months pregnant. But Trace is happy, and we all know that is all that matters.  Ryker is gifted one of those ride on horses so they film him rolling around the house on that for awhile and of course it’s linked so you can buy one also for just $300.  As if the golf trip with bird dude wasn’t uncomfortable enough, next up we get to watch Trace play Twister with Lydia’s brother.  Just 2 grown men twisting their bodies around each other while Lydia laughs awkwardly. Lydia is determined to keep working out and at 39 weeks she’s sharing gym selfies and then spends the rest of her morning opening... and linking... PR packages.  The weekly vlog has Kelly Joe back on the couch to answer more pregnancy and labor questions.  It’s the same old stuff over and over except this time it’s sponsored by a red light mask for men. Trace Bates talking while wearing an infrared light up mask is my new night terror. What the hell is happening in this world?!?  Anyway, Kelly says she had 14 births with no pain medication and Trace calls her a super mom.  Kelly corrects him right away and says being a super mom has nothing to do with your pain management and everything to do with how much you love your kid.  Every now and then, a little sense seeps in.  It ends with Kelly Joe forcing Lydia to follow her up and down the sidewalk while she power walks to throw herself into labor.  Kelly can’t really take a long step bc of the ever present denim skirt, but Lydia lunges around for awhile while Trace keeps the camera rolling.  He also tells the world all of Lydia’s private business, giving away details about her body that shouldn’t be shared in polite society.  Later, she repacks her hospital bag and adds even more stuff. If she doesn’t have the baby soon, they’ll just have to hitch the little house up to the SUV and pull it over to the hospital parking lot.  Trace squeezes in a pretend football game in his tight spandex outfit and another week ends with these 2 still waiting.








7. Erin Bates loves to drop a passive aggressive sermon on social media.  This time it’s an old preacher saying in life the word of God has saved him from making bad decisions and that you must follow God and not do bad things.  God will keep you safe.  I wonder what bad decisions she’s referring to this time?  Carles is spending his Summer brothermomming his siblings, and Erin shows him reading to the littles.  She says he is so dutiful.  What a heavy word for a little boy.  Baby William gets a Friday night Gluten free, protein added, sugar free cardboard cupcake and the kids get to stay up late playing board games.  Instead of links, Erin uses hashtags for everything.  Father’s Day is almost here and that means Erin and Chad are boxing together all of their doodles, leather coin dishes and other crap and selling it to you for either $32 or $52.  Erin doesn’t really need to sell much these days, her gender reveal vlog has over 200,000 views making her the best performing Bates along with... Michael and Brandon. That’s right.  Their vlog announcing the foster kids is also at 200,000 views.  Carlin and Katie must be quaking in their Sambas.








8. Michael just can’t help but post about her foster children.... especially knowing the big numbers she pulled in on YouTube after announcing their arrival.  She posts a picture of arms and feet only in front of the story of Jonah story book.  She definitely used AI to describe how the kids are just enamored with God’s word already, and how she now understands childlike wonder.  I guess living with Brandon and having Lawson as a brother hadn’t cleared that up for her.  Anyway, she gets tons of comments from folks offering advice and asking questions.  The only family comments are from Law and Tiff. On Instagram she shares her homemade granola recipe and posts to congratulate her brother on the new baby. Their weekly vlog is an update on the children.  The last vlog left lots of questions, so this one provides more clarity. Michael says the children have lots and lots of appointments with doctors, specialists and others who are helping take care of both their emotional and physical needs.  She says this has all kept her very busy, and you have to wonder how her siblings are handling not having her at their disposal. She does say the sisters, Brandon’s family and their church family showered them with everything they could possibly need.  She especially comments on the Pastor’s wife, who brought items before they had even made it home.  Brandon explains that they are moving cautiously, and trying to love without being possessive.  It is a situation that can be fixed and the boys could return home.  He plainly says these kids are not available for adoption.  They say the 3 year old has lots of big feelings, which is just heart breaking.  They have had in home visits from a nurse who said she has seen a marked improvement in a very short time.  They confirm that they were working with a private adoption agency, and had to get licensed quickly to accept these foster children.  Brandon says they will keep their home study active with the private adoption agency, but for now, they are just concentrating on these 2 little boys.  Michael says she will not be sharing their rooms, or clothes or any pictures to protect their privacy... for now.  That doesn’t include their limbs being featured in an Alani ad... that, she can justify.








9. Tiffany Bates sealed her fate this week as another fundie brood mare.  Maybe we will finally get a break from the constant pregnancy baiting that has been happening since baby Will was 27 hours old.  Before the big announcement, Tiffy was busy making her Leave it to Beaver reels all week.  We see her talking to an empty space saying “motherhood doesn’t make you crazy, watching Lawson’s location as he is on the way home to “rescue” her and showing Will covered in yogurt saying this is why they want more kids.  Tiffy’s hair is a flat mess these days, weighing her down and she looks drained.  She tags her Southern California stylist who trimmed 3 hairs on her head and raves about her work.  While Tiffy is busy bragging, her hair is literally standing on end from static electricity.  Lawson throws up a reel saying he is getting “them” ice cream while only Tiffany is with him and their fans go into overdrive asking if she is expecting.  AI comes to the rescue to help her with a caption about all of the positives of being a mom.  “Just wait-the positive edition” she calls it.  Yes Tiffy... just wait until you can’t walk for 9 weeks again and Lawson has to carry you everywhere while you adjust to taking care of 2 babies. She’s back in the kitchen for another disaster... this time she calls garlic bread topped with cheese and a tomato homemade pizza.  Lawson doesn’t give her time to be ill, because he’s back with more baiting... this time Tiff is literally standing in front of the camera holding her pee stick as they ask the audience if “2 under 2"" is coming.  They are in California, staying with her parents and we see Will in the pool swimming with her mom.  She says she is so happy to be at home.  Remember that Lawson said they may spend half of the year in Cali... the Winter months especially.  Will the new baby be born on the West Coast?  Their announcement vlog cuts back and forth from now to the past so much that it is hard to follow, but the new baby is due this Winter and Tiffy acted like the 2 separate pregnancy tests she took weren’t real, screaming over and over to Lawson that “this can’t be real”.  Girl, please.  You have the bulk pregnancy tests.  You’ve been testing every 2 hours for months now.  Their social media announcement is cowboy themed, and this time Tiffany didn’t lose the first ultrasound pics.  Their duet plays over the reel. Lawson says the baby is a girl and he just knows it.  Tiffany is hanging on to hope, even though she says she wants a second son.








10. Bits and Bytes...Carlin and Whitney film a boutique reel saying they have so much fun working together...Kelly Joe finally posts about Layla’s dance recital and then announces that Mama Jane has completed radiation treatments.  She and Gil were there to watch her ring the bell...BSB has suddenly dropped prices on everything by $10-$20, leaving everything under $70...Esther shows off her hot legs with all of the Duggar chicks after completing 100 Burn bootcamps...Kelly Joe says happy birthday to Jadon who is 4.  She says she is so blessed that she gets to watch him grow up.  Tell us about the ones you DON’T get to watch Kelly...




I know this is late, but have a great week friends.  It’s almost Father’s Day... do we think Gil will get a fancy set of golf clubs?  Or just more left overs from his influencing broods pr packages?  Maybe someone will be groundbreaking and give him a.... shovel...

Despite some conversations, it has been a firm no and has caused friction in the house. These conversations have led to the one roommate to being very ornery and giving us the cold shoulder, which seems like a rather extreme response. The area we live in reaches 100+ in the day and only gets to 80-85 or so at night. We have great difficulty falling and staying asleep at night. 

Should we offer to pay the extra costs every month to run it? I have no idea how they are able to sleep, but it’s becoming unbearable for us. 

Beyond that, a coffee cup, laptop, etc. accidentally left out often leads to angry messages. It’s like they want us to pay them rent but not have roommates.

It’s been a while; May was certainly a long month. But here we are! Back again to list and discuss both obvious and not-so-obvious moments of William showing some kindness. It’s a defining trait of his compelling character, and I’d love nothing more than to recount moments where it shines with you. This time, we focus on his 3 years spent in New York and his return to London. :) 



So, as always, I hope you enjoy counting William’s acts of kindness with me, and be warned that this is a ***long*** post.



Note: Just like the last 2 parts, these acts are organised into chronological order. 



\~ \~ \~



# Post-Coma Period



# 38. Thanking Sherlock first thing after waking up



[Chapter 67](https://preview.redd.it/fdi0z1k3o56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=554f2f2bdb110d6ca32789d3c568f83d56d5f749)



I like to think this moment is quite overlooked in how kind it is towards both Sherlock and himself. Many post-coma patients would let confusion (or even denial) get the better of them, and if any of them experienced the same anguish as William, they wouldn’t be nearly as composed as he is in this moment. Really shows the goodness in his character that he’s not only able to control his emotions, but accept what happened and thank Sherlock for what he now considers a *service* on his behalf. :)



[Chapter 67](https://preview.redd.it/5aa3wxh9o56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26fe95490ddd51f7c0bde447722392ed654d2f8)



Oh, William… You have more of a heart than many.



# 39. Not telling Sherlock outright his coffee is lacklustre



[Chapter 68](https://preview.redd.it/odfjou7jo56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=63ad17dcd00e85c8f374c3b96ecdaf06f8bb8014)



Another scene in which we see his subtlety tell the full story. 😂



[Chapter 68](https://preview.redd.it/7wrs852oo56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=610770c2aa81f251652208ed096315ba0f5ad0ff)



Poor Sherlock…



# 40. Spurring Sherlock to help Billy just as he helped himself



[Chapter 70](https://preview.redd.it/f1d31uluo56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa2ee5cb019d8577151c49ac3de151ca77414081)



The title is a little confusing, I apologise. But this is an important moment, for Sherlock anyway. We can only imagine how much anxiety he went through whilst William was comatose. He might have doubted if his “stubbornness” really helped William, or if it just trapped him in perpetual gloom. Here, it’s affirmed through William himself that he was guided, thanks to Sherlock’s efforts and sacrifices. That must’ve had a greater effect on him than his pensive expression suggests.



# 41. Going out even when Sherlock told him not to



[Chapter 71](https://preview.redd.it/8uxc27g2p56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada949d2870d3a84e52dec7fb9efecb778ed79ec)



I just realised all the moments I included so far involve Sherlock, which is kind of obvious since William spent most of his time with him, but still. 😳



Just like the 38th moment, I’d say this is also overlooked in how kind he was to himself, by *ignoring* Sherlock’s request. I’d peg him as the type of person who doesn’t do well when restricted by 4 walls, when he’s alone with his thoughts. Especially in this vulnerable and sentimental phase, he surely predicted he wouldn’t fare well and, to avoid any distress inflicted on himself (and Sherlock), he had to take himself out. A little breath of fresh air, as minimal as it can be in effectiveness, can change one’s mindset *staggeringly*. So I like that he (1) acknowledges such miniscule differences and (2) goes against his self-deprecating tendencies and escapes what he knows could harm him.



Also, I just learned about the symbolism of the fountain he’s sitting by (The Bethesda Fountain) and I’m already getting emotional… I think I did better at holding my sentiments back in the first 2 parts. 😭 If you link its symbolism to William, you’ll probably be in the same state as I am now… :”(



Angel of the waters… The lily in its hand… 



And apparently, a fellow did a little spot-on analysis and interpretation of this. (I’m literally finding out all this as I’m typing, forgive me for dragging)

# 42. Helping Helena



[Chapter 71](https://preview.redd.it/2p5bwqoap56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ea9b3004854718db8a6f728dd0337bf4fa1faa9)



Oh God, William no–



[Chapter 71](https://preview.redd.it/7v1xfznep56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=be9ae05dbdee36c473c13854e8b55f61740efcea)



All jokes aside, I *love* how much Helena’s gratitude impacted him. How I interpret this moment is that, through helping another (especially the most innocent of the innocent), William is able to *find himself* again. We’ve encountered how dissociated he felt right after waking up, when he expressed how he doesn’t actually know what he’s supposed to do, nor does he know how to go about his atonement. But what he’s forgotten (courtesy of his coma) is that *helping others* has always been a habit he’s taken as an ingrained impulse in literally everything he’s ever pursued, whether it be gaining provisions in his childhood or abolishing a class system in his adulthood.



I already delved into this in another post of mine, but I consider his need to help others as the very essence of his character. And I love how the writers gave him this moment where he rediscovers this important part of himself again. Not only does it show how a coma can affect someone, but also the broad solution to William’s dilemma: how to go about his atonement (in his own way, as described by Sherlock).



# 43. Travelling all the way to Vermissa to help Sherlock



[Chapter 73](https://preview.redd.it/snsb9iflp56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=43bc987af161aaa7fe42e9090dea6326c303834e)



I think this moment is both surprising and unsurprising, given William’s character. Still, it takes you aback a little to see him exude so much physical prowess while being on the mend. It also speaks to his self-sacrificial nature, which was mentioned in part 1 of this masterlist. :) 



# 44. Issuing multiple warnings to the outlaws (before wiping the floor with them)



[Chapter 74](https://preview.redd.it/jzvjehvsp56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=335142d56d8af4738e0b630e4cffb3831cafeb22)



Maybe a little too kind, even for him. 😅 It still baffles me how he made it look like he wasn’t in any danger, as he stands at the centre of several rifle and gun-wielders…



Jack quite excelled in teaching him, didn’t he?



# 45. Seeking Sherlock’s support in his path of atonement 



[Chapter 75](https://preview.redd.it/9nk981izp56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c410e7e4fa55dc3bd803b4686a2bde756c38b9f)



I’m mentioning a lot of moments where he expresses kindness towards himself, aren’t I? Well, this is what his post-coma period is mainly concerned with, I feel.



This moment shows his humbleness in seeking another’s support, and not displaying absolute confidence in his intuition (that he would be able to stay on the right path). Again, another act of looking out for himself, which is very refreshing to see from William. :’)



# 46. Sending Sherlock a letter requesting him to take care of Moran



[Chapter 76](https://preview.redd.it/ap2lnq27q56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4edab4e694355d69d94ebc2e9c33ffe9fcf0e8)



While this action was necessary in preserving his (polished) ideals (in essence, removing murder as a means to an end), it shows the care he has for his associates, as mentioned in part 2 of this masterlist. :) 



# His return to London



# 47. Reassuring Albert #3



[Chapter 64](https://preview.redd.it/03sk33egq56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a97958d7bb9af475136be7424307ca913b3796)



I’d say this is a moment that really took hold of our hearts. It must’ve done a number on William’s own heart to see Albert in the state he was in. He probably never saw him like that. So it was extra special to see how effective his words and gestures were in shifting Albert’s frame of mind, and taking him out of the darkness (and into the light, if we want to use Albert’s wording. Though, I think he uses a phrase along those lines in reference to Mycroft sending Charles “Little Charlie” Dickens the Bird™ to him every now and then. 😅)



# 48. Encouraging Louis’s leadership



[Chapter 65](https://preview.redd.it/1cwtn5hpq56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=854f3120f2a74f335abc41cebfd52894e2680df8)



William laughing! I like to think this shows Sherlock’s good impression on him (in showing more outward emotion and being more carefree). After all, as remarked by Jack and Zack, that was his nature as a child and before The Moriarty Plan started.



Also, along with William’s decision to allow Louis’s participation in his plans (back in Chapter 10), we see another figurative “push” towards Louis’s succession (as we see in Part 2 of the manga).  



# 49. Checking in on the state of his home country (being the patriot he is)

[Chapter 76](https://preview.redd.it/ak1i0gt0r56f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=29237ad6f55dfc25f7ff8899df1198dcfd942f01)



Of course you are. 🥹



\~ \~ \~



# Final Remarks

  
An abrupt end, I know. But just like the first 2 parts, I found William’s latter experiences to be pretty tear-inducing. (I still can’t get over the fountain symbolism). Though, something particularly interesting I want to bring up once more is that these arcs mainly focused on him *finding himself* again. With the remarks of surrounding characters, we see that even they observe the changes (and improvements) in William’s behaviours. It cements how much they, too, look out for him, and genuinely care for his wellbeing. These acts of kindness explored can teach us how to improve leniency towards our own selves, which twists the narrative of what being “selfless” means. William is a selfless person, yes. But he knows when to step back and preserve his own wellness when it counts. (Sometimes he throws himself into action, like what he did in Vermissa, but I mean– Sherlock’s life was at risk, then.) 



I hope you’ve experienced another bout of heart-warming inspiration, just as I have. :”)



So that’s it for the manga’s part 1! I’m looking forward to covering other adaptations. 



It’s possible the next part of this masterlist will cover either the light novels or omakes/extras, who knows…

I’m currently on a bag of [James Gourmet Coffee Colombian El Carmen Filter]( https://hellocoffee.uk/products/decaffeinated-colombian-el-carmen-filter?_pos=2&_fid=46df220db&_ss=c). It was roasted on June 5th.


I use a ceramic V60 (size 02), and pretty much always grind 22g of beans, using a 16:1 water ratio.


I am really struggling to get a great cup out of it – I’m fairly new into coffee and this phrase was something that I could never get my head around, but I totally understand it now. The beans are light roasted, and the coffee comes out quite pale, and although I don’t think I have either the palette, or vocabulary, to adequately narrate my coffee tasting experience, the brew always seems slightly too acidic. I think the taste is growing on me, but I’ve had much more flavourful light roast decafs.


I’m using a Kingrinder K6, set to approximately 100 clicks (usually with caffeinated beans I’d grind at around 80-90), I’m trying not to agitate mixture whilst it’s dripping, but other than that I am at a loss.

I’m at a bit of a loss here regarding my weight loss. I started mid-April and went from 235 to 208 in about 40 days or so, I’m assuming some of its water weight but weighing myself at the same time each day tracked a bit under a pound per day loss. TDEE calculators peg me at about 3200c/day maintenance and I was around 1300. 

This is doing the 75 hard program, so I’m running a 4 day split 5-3-1 boring but big with some core and auxiliary work on the 3 non-program days. I also walk/jog 4 miles every evening and have been doing a lot of masonry work around the house. 

My diet specifics I set for myself were low carb 20/4 fast (eat from 5pm to 9pm) with an allowance for my morning latte. Loose measuring gave me 190 calories for my coffee then 900 - 1200 calories for my dinner. About a month ago there was a change to my goal date and I tweaked things a bit. 

Every day I have two protein shakes:
Breakfast - 130 calories
12oz water
33g ghost coffee ice cream protein powder (120c)
4oz ice cubes
 1.5oz 0 calories Carmel pecan syrup
2oz espresso (10c)

After dinner (8pm)- 160 calories
12oz water
4oz ice cubes
5g sugar free chocolate pudding mix (15c)
34g ghost Cinnabon protein powder (130c)
5g benefiber (15c)

Last night my meal was 755 calories. 
200g trimmed tri tip (315c)
28g blue cheese crumbles (100c)
100g baby spinach (100c)
30g black olives (40c)
30ml pomegranate dressing (40 calories)
28g crushed pistachios (160c)

I’m also drinking between 1 and 1.5 gallons of water per day. I am only getting about 6 hours of sleep but that’s normal for me. 

The only thing that changes daily are my dinners but everything is measured, normally before cooking then divided equally after it’s done. I know I’m on the low side but I don’t understand how my weight isn’t dropping and my lifting isn’t being impacted (1rm is going up for each). 

I’ve lost another few inches from my waist but the scale hasn’t changed. My fiancé is dropping weight as well (not as drastic) and the scale is reporting this correctly so it’s not the scale. 

I’m just confused and wondering what could be going on. I’m pusing a 2000+ calorie deficit and should be down to almost 190 instead of the 205 I’ve been stuck at for 3 weeks. Is there any reason the weight isn’t going away or anything specific I should try? If it’s an imbalance of some kind, should I get bloodwork done and what would I be looking for?
