I'm happy that you guys like the stories. And yes, it is an Anthology. I have been keeping these stories under a rug for a year and half. Unsure of the reception. But finally made a decision to share it. It was difficult to finish some of the stories because I would cry in between writing. So here goes. Thank you. 



You could tell the crew wasn’t sure about him the moment he stepped onto the deck.

It wasn’t because of his size, though he was big, broad-shouldered in a way that made the narrow corridors feel smaller, or because of the scar along his forearm that looked suspiciously like claw marks. It was because of the word in his file.

Human.

A Deathworlder.This particular one, Jace Raan, had grown up on Carthus-IV, a planet where even the rivers had teeth. The classification of his species had labeled them Category Red: Apex-of-apex. The kind of creature that survived environments other species wouldn’t step foot on. The kind of creature that learned to laugh while things with claws hunted you in the dark.

The captain, a Kestari named Velys, feathers always immaculate, read his service file three times and still didn’t like it. Neither did the Xeylan navigator, who muttered about “primitive instincts,” nor the two Eriari engineers who whispered about “unpredictable temper.” 

But Jace? Jace just grinned, offered everyone coffee (whatever that was, hot, vaguely suspicious), and started fixing things no one even knew were broken. Within two weeks, half the ship trusted him with their lives. Within five, the other half grudgingly admitted he was actually kinda nice for a deathworlder.

He called the captain “Vel,” much to her horror. He nicknamed everybody. He carried heavy components like they were made of air. And when the youngest crewmate, a timid Sauren cadet, got her tail stuck in a hatch door, Jace just knelt down, pried it open with his bare hands, and said, “No biggie, kid. Happens to the best tails.”

For a while, life aboard the FSS Calliope was easy. Smooth patrol routes. Quiet cargo inspections. The kind of routine that lulled even the most nervous crew into forgetting that war ever touched Auris, or that a Kargil fleet was massing somewhere beyond the stars.

It was during one of those quiet stretches, while the Calliope drifted on a long survey arc, that Velys found herself sitting across from Jace in the mess hall long after lights-out. He was nursing his coffee, staring into the cup like he expected it to fight back.

“You don’t sleep much,” she said.

“Grew up where sleeping too long made you breakfast,” Jace replied with a half-smile.

Velys tilted her head, feathers catching the dim light. “I’ve read about humanity. War-prone, unpredictable, reckless to the point of madness. Yet you laugh. You help. You… mend things.”

Jace looked down at his scarred hands. “Not always. I’ve broken things too.”

There was a weight in his voice she hadn’t heard before. Velys stayed quiet, waiting.

“I wasn’t always an engineer,” he went on slowly. “I was military. Back in Sol space. Earth rules a bunch of colonies, you probably know that. Some didn’t like being told how to live. They called themselves the Free Planet Alliance. Said Earth’s laws were strangling them.”

“You fought them,” Velys guessed.

“Yeah,” Jace said softly. “I was damn good at it. Too good. Kicked doors, cleared bunkers, thought I was on the right side.” His eyes unfocused, fixed on some memory far away. 

“Then we hit what we thought was a military outpost. Intel was bad. It was just a settlement. Families.”

He swallowed. For the first time, the grin was gone.

“I found this kid. A little girl. Maybe seven. Crying over her mom’s body. She looked at me like I was the monster. And hell, maybe I was. That look stuck. It crawled under my armor and wouldn’t leave.”

Velys’s feathers tightened. “What did you do?”

“I took her. Couldn’t leave her there. Her name is Rae.” His voice softened on the name. “She hated me at first. I didn’t blame her. But she came around. Kids do, when you stick long enough.”

He sighed, rubbing his temple. “Thing is… Federation regs don’t get adoption. Not when it’s cross-species, or even human to human without papers. She wasn’t mine by blood, so I couldn’t take her into official space with me. So I left the army, signed on wherever I could. Good pay on Auris patrols. Figured I’d save up, get her enrolled in the Federation fleet. It’s all she ever wanted, to see the stars.”

Jace smiled faintly, almost shyly. “She wanted to wear one of these uniforms someday. Thought it made people heroes.”

Velys felt something twist deep in her chest. “Does she know?”

“That I’m here? No. I send credits. Best I can do until I make it right.” He stared into his cup again. 

“One day, Vel. One day I’m gonna walk her onto a deck like this, tell her it’s all hers. That’s the dream.”

Few weeks have passed after that talk. And then it happened.

No scan. No warning. Just fire.

One moment the Calliope was gliding over Auris’ upper atmosphere; the next, plasma rounds tore through her hull. The lights flickered. Pressure alarms howled. The first boarding craft slammed into their aft bay with a sound like thunder.

“Shields weren’t even tripped!” the navigator screamed, claws dancing over the console. 

“They came out of nothing!”

“Cut the chatter!” Velys snapped. “Get to positions!”

But everyone knew: it was too fast. Too close.
The enemy was already inside.

The stand began in the port corridor.
Jace waded into the first wave of Kargil warriors with a spanner in one hand and a makeshift club in the other. Plasma bolts scorched past him, carving black lines into the bulkheads, but he never ducked. He smashed a rifle aside, took a blade across his ribs, and kept going. When his club broke, he used the shaft. When that cracked, he used his fists.

A drone leapt at him from the ceiling. He caught it by the throat-mount, tore out its power cell, and hurled it like a grenade into the next squad. The corridor bloomed with sparks. “That’s three strikes, you’re out,” he muttered, already charging the next target.

The crew saw him everywhere, dragging wounded into pods, sealing bulkheads manually when the power failed, holding off enemies long enough for the crew to scramble aboard escape pods. By the time he reached engineering, his coveralls were black with soot and blood, and his grin looked carved in place.

The captain found him rerouting power straight to the reactor.

“We’re venting atmosphere.” Velys started.

“Yeah, no kidding,” Jace said. “Listen, Vel. You’ve got fifteen minutes to get everyone into the pods.”

“What are you doing?”

“Making sure you get away.”

“No. We abandon ship together.”

He looked at her then, that infuriating human calm in his eyes. “Vel… you won’t get another shot at this. They’re not just boarding. They’re covering for an invasion fleet. I saw the long-range ping. Whole quarter-arm of ‘em, sliding in behind this skirmish.”

She froze. “How do you know?”

“Because I’ve done this before.” He gave her a bloody smile. “Go.”

When she tried to override his lockout, he slammed the console with his bare hand. Sparks flew. Doors sealed her out. “Get them clear, Captain. Don’t make me come haul you myself.”

The few remaining minutes were chaos.

Twenty Kargil stormed engineering. Jace met them with a length of coolant pipe and a grin full of broken teeth. He ducked under plasma fire, rammed the pipe straight through an enemy’s chestplate, and used the body as a shield while he kept swinging.

The reactor alarms screamed. The ship groaned. Jace laughed. He tore the safety interlocks out by hand, overriding layers of code with brute strength and a wrench. When a Kargil officer lunged at him, he head-butted it hard enough to dent its helmet, then hurled it into the coolant chamber.

He was bleeding badly now, one leg dragging, one arm burned to the bone, but he didn’t stop. From a pocket in his scorched coveralls, he pulled a cracked photo. A little girl with dark hair, grinning wide, gap-toothed. Rae.
Jace stared at it for a long, still moment as enemy boots pounded closer. “Sorry, kiddo,” he whispered, voice shaking now. “I promised I’d get you to the stars. Guess I’ll just clear the way.”

He slapped the last manual override into place, shoved a fallen Kargils blade into the emergency core breach lever, and twisted until the whole ship began to glow. Plasma fire tore into him, but he didn’t even flinch, eyes locked on the photo. “I’m gonna make this ship famous for you, Rae. You’ll ride one as fancy as this someday. Swear it.”

From her escape pod, Velys watched him die.
Through the viewport, she saw the Calliope’s hull alive with fire, Kargil dropships peeling away like startled insects. She hammered the comm, screaming his name.

“Jace! Abort! Do you hear me? Abort!”
His voice came through rough but steady, the same tone he used to offer coffee in the mornings.

“No hard feelings, Vel. Tell the guys I’m sorry.”

“Jace, I am ordering you!”

“Yeah, yeah. You’re the captain.” A pause, a ragged breath. “Do me a favor? Make this ship famous.”

Then, quieter, almost tender, not for her but for the photo in his hand:

“See you in the stars, kiddo.”

And louder, grinning through blood, for the enemy.

“YIPPEE-KI-YAY, YOU SPACE LIZARD SONS OF-”

Static. Light. Silence.

The Calliope detonated like a miniature sun. The blast ripped through a quarter of the Kargil fleet, shattering their momentum before they ever touched Auris’ surface.

Twenty Cycles Later

The war is over now, though scars remain on the ground and in the hearts of those who lived it. The old crew of the Calliope serve aboard a new ship. Sleeker. Faster. Stronger. Its name stenciled across the hull in bold letters:

FSS Jace Raan.

They tell the story to every cadet who comes aboard. How a deathworlder engineer, the guy who made coffee and told worse jokes, saved an entire planet by steering the ship into hell and laughing as he did it.

And sometimes, when danger looms or a mission looks impossible, someone on the bridge will grin, hit the thrusters, and say what Jace said, what they all say now when they’re about to do something brave or stupid.

“Yippee-ki-yay.”

The captain says it with pride. The crew says it with love. And somewhere in the quiet hum of the engines, they almost swear they can hear him laughing back.",1,1756534296.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

We had been friends for 15 years, and he was like a younger brother to me. He has spent the last 12 or so years in and out of prison. I am the only person (other than his mum, who I am close with) that had stood by him, been at his court appearances, supported him financially etc. I welcomed him into my family. I did everything I could to be a good friend to him when no one else would.

Just over a year ago, he told me he was in love with me. Our friendship became strained and ultimately ended (or so I thought). Then one night he turned up to my work, and the events of that night got me fired. I was unfairly dismissed, and it's now in the hands of my employment advocate. My reputation is ruined and I am struggling to find work. Small town, word travels.

In case anyone is wondering why I haven't blocked him or why I responded, I have kept them as proof of harassment, and to show the police that I have insisted he leave me alone.

He is currently in prison FOR THE SECOND TIME SINCE HE SENT ME THESE MESSAGES. I have also recieved mail from him in jail. Despite my requests for him to leave me alone, and his mum telling him the same, he still continues to contact me.",1,1756534227.0,texts,1,1.0,False
1n3u9px,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1n3u9px/i_just_realised_i_was_in_an_abusive_relationship/,I just realised I was in an abusive relationship,"This is a pretty hefty post as I just need to vent and to clear all of this mess out of my system so I can feel lighter and get back to feeling like myself again.


 I dated a guy for 10 months and all throughout it was on and off after just a few weeks, it was like a fairytale at the start he would shower me with love and would want to be with me 24/7 even after I had asked a few times since the first few days for some space to process all the changes of suddenly jumping into a relationship which started on our first date after talking for a week on Tinder, and after sleeping and spending the night together at his place.
He was really sweet and told me he loved music and animals and his dog immediately took an instant liking and is naturally very affectionate. It felt like everything was perfect and that I had found my soulmate.

It felt like we had known eachother years but on the morning after I got a hunch that I should leave and not return. 
 
In the timespan of the relationship there was a pattern, a couple days will be great, before a few days of arguments over very minor differences in views or over nothing and he would often cause, we both highly suspect we have BPD and ADHD so I would understand whenever his emotions would get intense and I would try my best to be ""feminine"" enough to minimise conflict (he had old fashioned views on gender roles and would regularly say he wants a relationship like what his grandparents had, which seemed like a beautiful healthy relationship that had lasted decades, he wanted me to be a quiet and ""submissive"" woman who should allow the man ""to lead"" and to shut up and let him do what he wants, yet would also say that a relationship is a team, which is what I personally believe in. I believe that both partners equally protect and elevate eachother).

Because I was independent and naturally a physically and mentally strong woman with my own views and believed in equality, for everyone, he would call me ""masculine"", especially when I stood up for myself during verbal and physical conflict. I am a trained fighter and had to defend myself a couple of times when he came at me, he tried to choke me a few times until I nearly passed out, bust my nose and gave me a black eye, and would say women get beaten because they're too emotional. I could take it as it didn't hurt, I even let him push me to the ground, I was always strong when I needed to be and never raised a hand to him unless he was badly hurting me.. but it was the emotional shit that was beating me to a pulp.

He always wanted his feelings to be known and it took only now to realise he just pretended to show interest in mine, I accommodated everything for him to express himself but I had limited space to talk about my life and my feelings and mental health, so bottled things up which started to bring the relationship to a boiling point, because I started to react at the way he treated me and regrettably it was also in an aggressive way, he was also in contact with a few of his ex's, while individually speaking ill about them and their bodies and a number of others  while bragging that they're contacting him on his social media and phone. He also said he never cheated on any of his partners and that most of them had cheated on him or has left him for someone else.


I'm a secure woman, but my intuition told me to leave and not ever become attached to him, which I unfortunately ended up doing because I stayed, and that's when the showering with love pulled away and he became more intensely emotionally invested into the relationship and it became a hyperfocus for the both of us. (he would often talk about his mental health and suicide and I felt I couldn't leave because I'd be responsible for any reckless behaviour he'll commit)

 He had a toxic view on the roles of men and women and it slowly sapped my motivation to take care of myself and doubt my every move and thought, he liked that I was a woman who works out yet felt emasculated when I wanted to pick him up for a cuddle for fun after he lifted me, and whenever I wanted to carry any of my shopping bags he would scoop from me. He used the man being the cup and women being the water argument and that men can get 100 women pregnant while a woman who sleeps with 100 men will be ""tainted meat"" and will only conceive one baby. He would also talk so much like a nice guy or incel, referring women as ""females"".


 I lost the motivation to workout of months and lost myself as a person, I wanted to date someone who wasn't involved with cannabis as it negatively affects my mental health and he had lied about quitting smoking, which 2 weeks into the relationship after over a month clean, I relapsed, that's when shit also hit the fan. He also lied about having his own gardening business, his dad owns it and he despises his dad and is actually unemployed and prefers to be that way. Everytime I would try and talk about my feelings he would dismiss them and tell me to start considering his , and I felt so hollow that each time he'd break up with me over nothing that I would fully leave and then consider speaking to other people, because I felt so much better being detached from him and everything around him, except his beautiful sweet dog who he forgets to fill the water bowl for and treats in a strange way. 

It breaks my heart because the dog really loved me and I am an animal lover and fur mum myself and he would complain I give my own animals and the dog more love than I gave him. He used to say it was cute that I moved bugs from the path when out and about so they don't get stepped on, and then he'd sigh and complain that I'd stop to help them and tell me to leave them.

He ashamedly brought out some toxic traits in me and I became on edge constantly and would quickly get angry like he did, I took the shoving and hitting because I know I could overpower him no matter how strong he brags to be, I never wanted to hurt him yet he always acted like wasn't getting what he needed from me, and no matter what I did he always said I didn't try and make an effort. When he came at me one I held my hand out to his face accidentally connecting and breaking the frame of his glasses, which I paid to have replaced. He made it so hard to love yet told me I was hard to love, there were so many times I felt broken down and just needed to be held, but had no desire to hug him or even interact with him, it felt like a chore and it was constantly draining. 

He pretended a female neighbour was texting him flirty messages because he cuts the grass in her garden and they've spoken for 2 years and have only being friendly acquaintances, which neighbours normally are, but my view on reality was already distorted and I regrettably ended up threatening her, it's stupid because she seemed like a lovely lady and she worked as a carer which was my previous job and she also was struggling with health problems already in her mid 20s. We could have been friends, and I could have been friends with one of the exes who was also spiritual and loved animals, but he turned me against her too and I became hostile by default like he was. 



Also NSFW -


Every single time we got intimate he would do a position which hurt me because of the size of our anatomies, it causes a sharp pain and he would tell me ""no pain no gain"" and that I will get used to it within a few months. He would also forcefully pull me into a position which had hurt me because he was frustrated that he wasn't doing it right and that he was stressed about losing hardness. After the 3rd time we was intimate I cried because I felt there was something wrong with my body and would bear some of the the pain so he wouldn't get agitated. We both have insecurities yet I always lifted him up with compliments, he never accepted that my anatomy is the way it is and that he would often be too rough.

He kept telling me he genuinely loved me yet only wanted to provide me with sex and arguments, most mornings when I wake up first he causes an argument because I needed the toilet or that I was too loud with trying to lovingly suprise him with a coffee to wake up to, and also because I didn't have any drive to kiss him and say good morning like an automated servant, which I felt like.

I always wanted to cook for a partner and put together a huge plate and nurture with amazing nutritious meals, but he was happy eating 2 frozen fried chicken steaks everyday and told me he had a strict daily routine he likes to stick to (wake up 6am, food in oven 5pm, bed at 9pm) and I just lost the drive to do anything from my heart for him, because I knew it would be a waste. He tried to force intermediate fasting into me and criticise me for being hungry either as soon as I wake up or at night.

I was toxic for staying and stopping down to his level, when we were arguing and on the verge of breaking up I sent him screenshots of normal and nice conversations I had with other people while we were broken up to prove that I am adequate and that there are people who love me for who I am and have much more they want to offer and would love to have the love and care I offer too. I wanted to get back at him for the hurt he caused me before I'd leave to heal and move on to show that I wouldn't submit to any BS anymore and that I'm very capable of finding someone far better, which I eventually ended up doing and never looking back. It took many months of giving up and coming back when he'd tell me he'd miss me and invite me over but my stubborn self finally cracked. It took a lot of tears and anguish but I fought through it and realised I created a version of him in my mind which wasn't the real him. The real him wasn't the compassionate beautiful man I believed he was, I forgave him for all the times he made me feel like I wanted to die because my heart, self worth and quality of life was in his hands.

 I knew I should have never given him my heart or any mind at all. I felt sorry for him but also viewed the entire relationship as mainly casual, I felt barely any connection anymore and all that happened was sex and arguments. He loved seeking conflict with neighbours and random people who he thought looked at him in a certain way, I realise him for what he is and the final time he invited me over after a week long breakup  I just looked at him and felt absolutely nothing, and it felt great. Unfortunately because I made the dumb decision to visit we had a nice overnight stay and a huge argument in the morning, I left on my bike and he followed on his, so I yelled and called him out on all his BS and told him I had met someone else so everyone in the vicinity can hear so he'd realise what a dick he really is as a person because he was a narcissist and cared more about his image than the wellbeing of others, he doesn't care about any other soul not even his own mother who tried to raise him the best way.

 I was SICK to death of him never taking accountability while I was expected to take all the blame and feel guilty for what he did. He would say I ""turned it around"" when I spoke up about what he did, I always held my hands up whenever something dumb was said or done during an argument, but I have only heard him say sorry 3 times in a whole space of 10 months. I was constantly apologising and for things I didn't even do wrong. 

I just couldn't take it anymore, all I ever wanted to do was to just hold him and dissolve all this darkness away that he said he held so much of inside. But all I did was forget to dissolve mine that was building up and pushed me into thoughts and even plans of not wanting to live anymore. He would tell me I took things too personally whenever I told him something he said bothered me because he would directly try and make me feel insecure when he was in an off mood. 
It was constantly walking on eggshells and really believed that I had so many issues when I only have a few. He liked to live in a victim mindset and tried to accuse me of doing the same whenever I felt low and began to dwell on what I could have done to improve my life. 

I'm also very grateful I didn't fully commit myself to him because he had always been strange about women and 2 of his exes told me he was a serial cheat, my intuition had always been right from the start, he insisted he never wanted any other women but ""impulsively"" had sex with his ex 2 days after another breakup because he felt ""broken down"" and also the dates didn't add up about the timeline of their relationship, they dated for 6 months yet their end fell on the same month we met after a week of talking on a dating site. I can never know if he is a cheat, he always denies it. Whenever I questioned him he gets agitated and says he doesn't remember or care. He claims I felt bad for speaking to other people while we were broken up, but genuinely I felt great, I knew how destructive the relationship was and as soon as I left his place or ended a conversation with him I felt sudden peace. I really don't know if he ever felt love from me, he kept telling me I didn't know what love was and it really cut deep and already didn't feel loved at all.  

He would turn to heavy cannabis use and randomly blurted out on a couple occasions that he met women to have sex with as an escape from what I apparently seemed to have done to him, because I wasn't consistent enough with what he wanted, it was impossible because of the arguments.. he wouldn't repeat what he said and said it was false but I just couldn't believe him, whenever I spoke to people I was happily single and had meaningful genuine conversations that were building up to something real, I would cut the person off as soon as I got back with him which is shitty for me and that person. I can never know if he made the meetings up or if it happened while we were together and stable. I was humble and recently he contacted me of nowhere bragging that he slept with another woman just days after finding out that I truly moved on, took care of myself and worked out again, and got into a new relationship and have been dating a lovely guy for almost 2 weeks now. Someone who is stable, genuine, peaceful and loves my company, everything is so natural and calm and I love it so much. 

Even though I've healed, when he contacted me, old feelings of inadequacy try to creep up because of all the things he'd say to me but I pause and realise that the reality is that he wasn't good for me anyway, we never had a real connection and he will never be happy. I have remorse for the woman he claims he's recently met for just a day and spent 2 nights with bonking, whether she exists or not, because he's just using her to try and keep me off his mind and escape his guilt, and he will only repeat what he did to me and previous women.

He claims everything is great for him, the woman lives on a farm over 30 miles away and also has a dog and they're both playing on the field together... but I could hear in his voice he was mad he lost me and he left a voice note that was 33 minutes long, yet he was claiming to be waiting for ""this bitch"" to get out of the shower so he could bonk her again and brag about how amazing he is, yet when he bonked his ex he made out he met a random model who was wife material. It irritates me because of when he blurted during an argument about meeting women he mentioned a woman who lived 25 minutes away which is 30 miles and was seeing someone for 4 months, and that it wasn't true. When I asked for the woman's age and description he had to think, but whatever. He said he knew her for years and they spoke and met after she sent a birthday message but wouldn't say from which platform. I honestly don't care if it's fantasy or part fantasy or completely true, especially since I've moved on and we broke up 2 months ago and barely had contact. If I couldn't make him happy, I don't think anyone can, he said he was what he needed all his life and that he never loved a woman as much as me, heck I even met his mother just a week in and the last ex who met his mother was from 15 years ago, and he has been with A LOT of women in his life. 

He is blocked on everything and finds new ways to contact me so I'm changing my number. 

 I realise how insecure that man really is, he even believed he would grow boobs from a tiny amount of soya milk in his coffee and for someone who was obsessed with his masculinity and claimed to have a higher testosterone level than the average man, he was pretty feminine and claimed to have a woman's intuition and that his mother wanted him to be a girl!

He also admitted throwing a knife at one of his exes during an argument and luckily the door closed in time, and being violent in previous relationships. He had weapons all over his place and also has a zombie knife which are illegal in the UK.

I can't believe I let myself into so much mess, he would tell me I had a lot of potential and now I wonder what he meant by that, because it wasn't for a beautiful life growing old together and building our own kingdom. It was nothing but arguments and sex, and we very rarely went anywhere out together!


I do question my self worth and esteem at times, but I can identify that I already grappled with those before I knew him, and how to resolve them, and to also take more action for myself in life and leave where I don't feel the vibe is right, no matter how uncomfortable it feels, no matter how hard the tethers pull, just imagine not having any and you're already free, it instantly feels better. I grew up in a chaotic environment so I was already familiar with toxic behaviour, and even though it motivates me enough to be a much better person, I felt lost when I'd take the first steps forward. I would forgive him for all the horrible shit he said and done, all the whole days I cried and when he encouraged me to take my life. 
I just hope that he knows he didn't win and I know it will eat him up inside, no matter how much he tries to act cold and distant, I no longer care and cut off contact permanently. He will always be miserable and i feel bad for the next lady because she will experience the same. I'm worried one day he'll severely hurt someone because he had threatened that he would black out and kill me, and not every woman is as strong and resilient as I am, I had to be that way to survive and I'm trained to defend myself,
he isn't as physically strong as he claims to be and has bad balance. 

I do have myself to blame for a lot of things, and that's all because I didn't leave when I should have done and allowed the toxicity to manifest itself. Some people just can't be helped no matter how much you try, no matter how much empathy, kindness, resources, energy and sympathy you pour. It's not you, it's them.

I would constantly split between intensely loving that man to being glad he's away from me, and as time progressed I loved him less and lost a lot of respect for him, and stupidly I continued to doubt myself and stay marinating in a place where I clearly wasn't wanted and didn't want to be in any longer.


I hope more people out there remember what they truly deserve and not feel guilty about being happy for yourself, by yourself, or in a new and happy relationship.

If you’re actively trying to conceive, it’s worth knowing which foods might reduce your chances.

1. **Highly processed foods** – Fast food, fried foods, and packaged snacks can cause hormonal imbalance, weight gain, and inflammation.
2. **Excess caffeine** – More than 2–3 cups of coffee daily may reduce fertility in some women.
3. **Sugary drinks** – Regular sodas and sweetened juices can increase insulin resistance, which may impact ovulation.
4. **Trans fats** – Found in margarine, baked goods, and processed fried foods, these fats can negatively affect reproductive health.
5. **High-mercury fish** – Such as shark, swordfish, and king mackerel- may harm egg quality over time.
6. **Excess alcohol** – Heavy drinking can disrupt hormone production and menstrual cycles.  

It’s important to remember that occasional indulgence isn’t the problem; it’s consistent overconsumption that may cause issues. Fertility is also influenced by stress, lifestyle, and underlying health conditions.

For anyone struggling to conceive, a personalized approach works best. **Dr. Poonam Goyal** can help create a fertility-friendly diet plan based on your health history, lifestyle, and nutritional needs. With her guidance, you’ll know exactly what to include, what to limit, and how to balance your meals to support your chances of pregnancy.",1,1756534104.0,ivfjourneydelhi,0,1.0,False

But, I joined this sub to learn. And to look at jewel and terrarium pics. But mostly to learn. I went through old posts and from what I can tell, care should be similar to Anoectochilus? I have 3 varieties of Anoectochilus in the same terrarium, along with Dossinia Marmorata and the mandatory Macodes Petola. Even the variegated Anoectochilus is doing well, growing steadily, sizing up.

But the Cystorchis really seemed to struggle, the leaves kept crinkling, and after a really lengthy migraine where I fell behind on watering... it finally gave up the ghost. It's a doornail. 😭

In general, does it want higher humidity than these other jewel orchids? More light? Less light? I'd like to try again at some point, but only after I can figure out why it did so much worse than the others. Even before the migraine that refused to end, I got the impression that it was always slowly dying despite an occasional new leaf. 

It was in the top right of the terrarium. Pics taken in March and August. And May.

I'm using an arachnid terrarium. Enclosed enough to keep (most) of the jewels happy, but with enough vent holes to keep mold from invading. I'm using sphagnum moss mixed with bark fines and horticultural charcoal. Every 2nd or 3rd watering I fertilize. There's drainage (I drilled holes). I'd like to have an actual drainage layer, but I'm trying to keep this terrarium short so that it fits in the area under the glass in my coffee table. 

Underwatering at the end was the final nail in the coffin for Cystorchis, but in general - what does this plant need to thrive that's different from Anoectochilus or Macodes? Any advice is appreciated. ",1,1756533795.0,Jewelorchids,0,1.0,False

I’m 22, a Software Engineer working at a tech company in Islamabad. I moved here in Islamabad from Lahore recently after this company invited me for an interview, offered me a solid package, and well I aced it and got the job. So here I am, figuring out life in a new city.

Now, about me I’m a mix of brains and looks. At work, I’m the nerdy genius who makes code behave, but outside work I like to keep things classy. I’ve been told I’ve got a pretty face (not complaining 😅), paired with a wide chest, soldier legs, strong build, and fair skin. Most days you’ll find me in a suit or Gurkha pants with a tucked tee shirt as this style is kind of my thing.

Fun fact: I also published 5 eBooks on coding last year, so yes, I’m a bit of an author too as I believe life’s more than just deadlines and screen time.

I’m not someone who stresses over money i mean insan ko koi bht ziada parwah ni honi chyea agar if it brings happiness to me or puts a smile on my vibe partner’s face, it’s worth it. Be it coffee sessions, exploring new food spots, or planning fun activities, I believe experiences > expenses.

Transport-wise, bari gari to nahi mere paas soon allah dega inshallah but my mid size hatchback is still in Lahore (I’ll bring it soon), but for now I ride my neat & stylish blue YBR and honestly, Mgy Thandi hawa ki feel bht achi lagti when cruising through the city.

What I’m looking for? A girl who enjoys meaningful conversations, coffee dates, walk & talks, laughing at silly jokes, or even sitting quietly while overthinking together. Someone grounded, kind, and mature enough to value good energy, but playful enough to enjoy random adventures. No pressure, no games if we vibe, perfect. If not, still good vibes only.

About me in quick points:

22, ambitious, and carving my own path.

Software Engineer + Author of 5 coding eBooks.

Pretty face + fit lifestyle (wide chest, big thighs, strong build).

Stylish, well-dressed, and a little extra when it comes to grooming.

Meme lover, chai addict, believer in respect and boundaries.


If this feels like your vibe, my DMs are open (with respect, of course). Who knows maybe Islamabad will feel a little less new for both of us.

Hello Guys,

Coffee Newbie here,

  
Using my Vantro X1, I have started making lattes now at home, espresso is not sour and looks fine when brewed with 22-25 secs time, I am using a metal tamper and no distribution tool, Since I do not have a coffee grinder, I am using a home blender/mixer to grind it finer like table salt but planning to buy Instacuppa coffee grinder based on reviews I read online, I do not want to spend much unless I know I am capable enough or not to use it.

I am trying to make my espresso less watery but since I do not have a non pressurized basket, I am stuck with the one that came with the machine. Fake crema works for me for now but I want to get a bottomless filter or a non pressurized basket for better crema extraction and goey espresso shots.

  
Am I moving in the right direction ? I do not wish to keep spending unless I make the best out of what I have.

\## HARD BANNED PHRASES (Never Use)



\### Meta-Commentary & Disclaimers

\- ""It is important to note that""

\- that's why it's just a 'X', but it's a 'Y'. 

\- But here’s the catch

\- ""This underscores the importance of""

\- they don’t just 'x', they start 'y'.

\- ""It cannot be denied that""

\- ""As of my knowledge cutoff""

\- And the X(benefit, mistake, big lesson)?- a attempt to make emphasis. 

\- They don’t need 'x', they need 'y'. 

\- you not only 'x', you know you can 'y'

\- Because the transformation isn’t 'x'. It’s in the 'y'.

\- 'a' aren’t 'x'. They’re 'y'.



\### Generic Openings & Closings

\- ""In today's fast-paced world""

\- ""In this ever-evolving landscape"" 

\- ""In the digital age""

\- ""In conclusion"" / ""To summarize"" / ""Finally""

\- ""Let's delve into"" / ""delve deeper""

\- ""At its core"" / ""at the core""



\### Overused Transitions

\- ""Moreover"" / ""Furthermore"" / ""Additionally"" (limit to once per 800 words)

\- Consecutive paragraphs starting with ""However"" / ""Therefore""

\- No “X isn’t the problem, Y is” constructions

(Example: “In SaaS, the biggest enemy isn’t churn, it’s user apathy.”) → Too cliché, overused.

\- No “rule of three” lists inside a sentence

(Example: “Fight this with more features, more ads, or more discounts.”) → Feels copy-paste marketing.



\### Buzzword Clichés

\- ""Ever-evolving landscape""

\- ""Dynamic world of""

\- ""Digital realm"" / ""in the realm of""

\- ""Uncharted waters""

\- ""Embark on a journey""

\- ""Treasure trove of information""

\- ""Game-changer"" (unless backed by specific metrics)



\## RESTRICTED WORDS (Use Sparingly - Max 2 per post)



\### Corporate Jargon Cluster

\- Leverage, optimize, enhance, utilize, synergy, Notice

\- deliverables, holistic, capability

\- Pivotal, crucial, groundbreaking, cutting-edge (unless specific)

\- Explore, delve, ensure, foster, embark



\### Vague Qualifiers

\- Significant, relevant, dynamic, innovative

\- Comprehensive, robust, streamlined



\## DOS: What Makes post Human



\### use phrases and words like

1. If you want to actually \[audience desire\]. 

2. a big separate 'BUT'- to assert your point in contrast

3. Why aren’t you \[doing what you want your audience to do\].

4. he real reason why \[audience problem\]- hook statement. 

5. Here is the fix ↓

6. one step at a time.

7. Want a deep dive on this?- in CTA

8. Most \[target audience\] think the biggest risk in business is making the wrong move.

9. I'll show you my x-step process.

10. So, how do you achieve \[desired outcome\]. simple. just follow \[process/framework/blueprint/template\]?  

  



\### Writing Style

✅ Mix sentence lengths (aim for 20-30% under 10 words)

✅ Use conversational contractions (you're, don't, can't)

✅ Include occasional sentence fragments for emphasis

✅ Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee

✅ Use specific numbers instead of ""many"" or ""several""



\### Voice & Tone

✅ Be direct and opinionated when appropriate

✅ Share personal observations or experiences

✅ Use industry-specific terminology naturally

✅ Include ""insider"" perspectives or behind-the-scenes details

✅ Reference current events or timely examples



\### Structure Variety

✅ Vary paragraph lengths (some 1 line, others 4-5 lines)

✅ Use natural transitions based on logic, not formulaic words

✅ End sections without announcing ""in conclusion""

✅ Let the content flow logically without scaffolding



\### Specificity Requirements

✅ Include at least 3 proper nouns (companies, people, places)

✅ Provide at least 1 concrete example per main point

✅ When citing trends, name the source or study

✅ Replace vague claims with specific mechanisms or processes



\## DON'TS: Avoid AI Patterns



\### Generic Structure

❌ Don't use the intro-body-conclusion template obviously

❌ Don't start 3+ paragraphs with the same transition word

❌ Don't make all paragraphs similar length

❌ Don't announce your structure (""First, I'll discuss..."")



\### Tone Mistakes

❌ Don't be overly polished or risk-averse

❌ Don't use abstract balance statements without examples

❌ Don't speak in generalities without backing details



\### Content Red Flags

❌ Don't make broad claims without specific evidence

❌ Don't use ""research shows"" without naming the research

❌ Don't rely on platitudes that could apply to any topic





\## NEWSLETTER-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES



\### Subject Lines

\- Use specific numbers: ""3 changes"" not ""several updates""

\- Reference current events or recent developments

\- Ask direct questions about reader challenges

\- Avoid generic promises like ""boost your success""



\### Pain Point Discussion

\- Name specific frustrations readers face daily

\- Use concrete scenarios: ""When your manager asks for ROI data but your analytics show...""

\- Include reader quotes or messages when possible

\- Quantify the problem with real data



\### Solution Presentation

\- Explain the ""why"" behind each step

\- Use active voice: ""You'll configure"" not ""Configuration should be done""

\- Include potential obstacles and how to handle them

\- Give specific timeframes: ""within 2 weeks"" not ""soon""



\### Call-to-Action

\- Be specific about what happens next

\- Set clear expectations about time/effort required



\## QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE SENDING



\### Banned Phrase Scan

\- Search for all hard-banned phrases and rewrite

\- Count restricted words (max 2 per newsletter)

\- Check for repetitive transitions



\### Specificity Score

\- Count proper nouns (target: 5+ per newsletter)

\- Verify concrete examples (1 per main section)

\- Confirm all statistics include sources



\### Voice Authenticity

\- Read aloud - does it sound like human speech?

\- Check sentence variety (mix of long/short)

\- Ensure contractions and conversational tone

\- Remove unnecessary corporate speak



\### Reader Value Test

\- Can reader immediately understand the problem?

\- Are solutions actionable within their context?

\- Would you personally find this useful?

\- Does it feel like insider knowledge vs. generic advice?



\## EMERGENCY PHRASE REPLACEMENTS



Instead of ""Moreover/Furthermore"" → ""Plus,"" ""And,"" ""Also,"" or just start with the point

Instead of ""It's crucial to"" → ""You need to"" or ""Make sure you""

Instead of ""Leverage this framework"" → ""Use this process"" or ""Try this approach""

Instead of ""In today's landscape"" → ""Right now"" or ""Currently""

Instead of ""Optimize your strategy"" → ""Improve your results"" or ""Fix your approach""



\## SUCCESS METRICS



Your newsletter avoids AI slop when:

\- Readers forward it to colleagues naturally

\- You get replies with specific questions or experiences

\- People reference your exact examples in conversations

\- Industry experts share or quote your content

\- New subscribers mention your ""unique perspective""

While having lunch at Koufu basement, I was queuing for coffee while my two other colleagues (1 Chinese, 1 Malay) were sitting nearby. Midway I noticed this guy (elderly, around 60ish) wearing polo tshirt with black pants and a backpack approaching my colleagues. The guy seemed quite insistent in asking my malay colleague to scan a QR code and that’s when alarm bells starting ringing. I approached them, quickly covered my malay colleague’s phone camera. This guy started explaining he needs malay participants to conduct a survey for him and shot back by pointing at me “you are not malay what”. All these while, I also observed that he had two A4 papers with him. One was word lengthy but in gist, it stated that $100 will be given to participants for every survey completed. Another paper showed solely a QR code. No company or logo branding were also seen on the header of these papers. He quickly left after I told my colleagues to be careful and ignore him. 

I’m not sure if any SMU students or staffs have experienced this before. I’m pretty sure it’s a scam and it sickens me that they might be prowling on students. Who knows the QR code contains malware and I’m just thankful my colleague didn’t manage to scan it. ",7,1756533054.0,SGExams,1,1.0,False

Previous unsuccessful attempts to cure included probiotic pills ,yogurt and adding salads and other raw vegetables and fruits in to my diet.which caused diarrhoea and severe gut issues leading to sudden increase in body odor.
That's when I turned to ayurveda to identify possible root causes .Turns out I have ama (toxin)build up which is a foul smelling sticky gunk that build up in our body when sensitive foods ferment in our body instead of digesting.

Sticky foul smelling stools =kapha imbalance 

Constipation and alternating stools=vata imbalance 

Burning sensation in stomach and diarrhoea=
Pitta imbalance.

These imbalances due to poor diet leads to ama buildup in the body .

Routine:
6am _10am=breakfast (warm ,light ,well cooked and easily digestible foods).

10am_2pm=lunch(digestion is peaked during this time, so eat lunch before 2pm).

After 2pm eat only ligh easily digestible foods dinner before 7 pm.

Eat 3 meals a day 3to 4hr gap between each meal(migrating motor complex active during this time).

Choose warm ,grounding and easily digestible foods during detox phase so that our body can focus on detoxification of existing ama instead of digestion of heavy foods.

Foods to avoid: heavy on digestion(ama forming)
Sugar, jaggery, honey, maple syrup and very sweet fruits.
Dairy products milk , yogurt,cheese,paneer etc.
Wheat products bread pasta etc
Raw vegetables and fruits in salads.
Caffeine..tea and coffee.
Fried , heavy oily foods.
Red meat ..beef ,lamb,pork etc
Fatty high sulphur fish.
Onions , garlic and shallots.
Cruciferous vegetables.
No fruit juices.

Safe foods:
Must include everyday:
Pumpkin
 Gourd family veggies ( ash gourd,bitter gourd, bottle gourd etc)
Carrots
Cucumber (not raw)
Zucchini 

Carbs:
 white rice or red rice
Sweet potato 

Protein:
 Lean meat(chicken without skin)
White fish
Moong dal 

In moderation:
Spinach
Toor dal
Horse gram
Nightshade vegetables( tomatoes, eggplant, capsicum etc)in moderation or completely avoid as it can cause gastric irritation.

Start your day with a cup of cumin water or warm water.
Avoid cold and sugary drinks completely.
Sip on warm water or room temperature water through out the day.

Nervous system healing and pelvic floor relaxation routine:

Miracle morning routine S.A.V.E.R.S.:

S:sit in silence and meditate ,deep breaths and humming.

Affirmations

Visualization 

Exercise (strech pelvic floor muscles)

Reading(something that adds positivity in your life)

Scribing/journaling.
 You can start doing this for 1min per each step in the beginning and gradually increase the time according to your preference.continue this forever .

As far as diet goes it is definitely very restrictive but always eat a balanced light nutritious meals .Do not deprive youself of essential nutrients ,that can cause long term health issues.

I do not recommend any kind of ayurvedic supplements.

My knowledge is limited,so please do your own thorough research on diets before you start.

Find more safe foods according to availability and your personal requirements.
 Your body thrives on routine and predictability.preferably one that coincides with your circadian rhythm.

Your body detoxes while sleeping.so sleep before 10:30pm that's when detox begins wake up without alarms to understand your natural circadian rhythm.

Eat and sleep around the same time everyday.

Additionally do a dopamine detox.Avoid reaching for you phone first thing in the morning when you wake up.avoid screen time and cultivate reading habit.

Avoid all or nothing attitude in life.If you give in to your temptations and cravings once that doesn't mean you continue to do it for entire day .just stop with once .it will just delay detox process a bit ,you don't have to start over.

Add more foods in to your diet after 6_8weeks.one by one.and see how your body reacts to the food.stop it if it aggravate symptoms and try to reintroduce it after few more weeks once the gut is healed and toxins are removed.
What to expect during first few days

1to 3days ...ama starts loosening from tissues and joints .so random mild aches are possible.

3to7 days: detox begins symptoms aggravate severely bacteria breakdown and release toxins .foul smell increases multiple times based on my experience,upset stomach.headche, feverish feeling etc  

See improvement In the second week:

Reduce transit time 
Regular well formed stools
Reduced body odour.
Stomach feels calm.
Overall better mood.
Feeling lighter in the body.

Please try this detox method and document your progress in a journal every day.you can improvice this method to fit in your needs ,with the help of chatgpt ,if you find my routine lacking in anyway.It gets worse before it gets better so brace yourselves.I hope you all find healing, happiness and peace in your lives🙏.

It is very important to avoid sugars , dairy, gluten cruciferous, allicin vegetables andcaffeine completely during detox phase.🚨🚧",2,1756532967.0,bodyodor,0,1.0,False

Started talking, one led the conversation. Asked for my number. Days later she texted me for a one on one Bible study with a friend of hers via zoom. We went at it for 2-3 weeks 2x week. Then this new friend thought I’d benefit from talking some Bible study classes she had taken. I signed up, attended one and she offered to talked again after to see how it went.

It’s not just “tea.” It’s a ritual, a stress reliever, and (if you’re into it) a spiritual practice.

**Balancing Ritual**  
Starting the morning with Tulsi tea sets the tone for me. It’s not like coffee where you get a jolt, but more like the body and mind find their natural rhythm. Some days I’ll also have a cup in the evening to wind down; it helps me switch gears and feel more grounded.

**Stress + Mental Clarity**  
Tulsi is what’s called an adaptogen, which basically means it helps the body adapt to stress instead of just covering it up. Over time, I’ve noticed it makes me less reactive and more focused when things get hectic. It’s subtle, but it builds up if you’re consistent.

**Spiritual Side**  
If you’ve ever been around Tulsi plants in India, you know there’s a sacred vibe around them. People pray with them, grow them in courtyards, and treat the plant almost like a family member. For me, even keeping a Tulsi plant at home feels like having a calming presence around. Drinking the tea before meditation also helps me settle into that space quicker.

**How I use it daily:**

* Morning Tulsi tea to start the day balanced
* Evening Tulsi infusion for stress release
* A Tulsi plant on my windowsill (adds both greenery and good energy)
* Occasionally Tulsi oil in a diffuser during meditation

Bottom line: Tulsi is less about quick fixes and more about creating a rhythm of balance. It’s medicine, ritual, and spiritual support rolled into one.",1,1756532268.0,Herblore,0,1.0,False

At the start of the year, I landed a big job. The wife of the Sean Group's boss hired me to seduce her husband, offering a hefty 600,000 dollars.

My line of work was similar to a ""Mistress Dispeller."" When stubborn mistresses refused to back off, the wife would call me in to play the other woman, luring the man into my trap. I'd outmaneuver the mistress, then vanish, leaving the man humiliated and deceived. Most would snap out of it and return to their families. For those dead-set on divorce, I'd gather evidence of their cheating, ensuring the wife got the biggest possible settlement to avoid losing out to some floozy.

The Sean Group, my latest client, was Yorkwell's wealthiest publicly traded company. Its chairman, Stanley Finn, had risen to a business titan thanks to his wife's connections. Men like him often had ulterior motives, using marriage as a ladder to climb higher. Once they got fat and comfortable, they'd turn on their wives, scheming to keep all the wealth. Even I wasn't fully confident taking this job. Men like Stanley were cunning, ruthless, and calculating. If I wasn't careful, he could turn the tables, leaving me with nothing but trouble and not a dime to show for it.

Still, Mrs. Finn's offer was too tempting to pass up. I decided to take the risk.

Mrs. Finn only gave me two pieces of information about Stanley.

First, he had little interest in women. Second, seducing him would take serious effort and a stroke of luck.

In my career, I'd met with thirty clients. Mrs. Finn's briefing was the briefest and sounded the toughest.

I took the photos she handed me. One showed Stanley's profile, focused on work. Another captured his back during a workout. Though lean, his clothes hinted at a solid, well-built frame. Stanley had a high nose bridge and strong brow, strikingly handsome from the side. His chiseled jawline struck a perfect balance between rugged and refined, exuding effortless charm. He was, without a doubt, more captivating than any man I'd dealt with before.

I asked Mrs. Finn, ""Are you trying to save the marriage or get a divorce?""

""Divorce,"" she replied bluntly. ""I want at least half his fortune.""

I couldn't help but frown. Half of the Sean Group chairman's wealth would be billions. No wife in the country had ever won that much in a divorce settlement.

Mrs. Finn noticed my hesitation. She placed a thick stack of cash on the table. ""Ms. Quinn, this is a $100,000 deposit. I've heard about your skills. Put in the effort, trick him into a big mistake, and the more damning the evidence, the better my chances.""

I stayed silent, weighing whether I could handle this.

Mrs. Finn sighed. ""Our marriage has been nothing but cold hostility. He's taken everything and now wants to toss me out with nothing. I'm desperate and have to protect myself. Don't worry about being exposed, Ms. Quinn. I'm not planning a public scandal. I'll settle this privately with him.""

I hesitated. ""What if the talks fall apart?""

Stanley wasn't the type to let a woman outsmart him without a fight.

Mrs. Finn replied, ""Then we'll go to court. Before the trial, I'll send you out of the province to lay low.""

My confidence wavered. ""What if your husband comes after me?""

""Ms. Quinn,"" Mrs. Finn said, her patience wearing thin, ""the safest thing is to not do this job at all. If you're in this line of work, surely you know how to handle the risks.""

I gritted my teeth and stuffed the cash into my bag. ""Three months. I'll deliver what you need.""

Mrs. Finn stirred her coffee. ""I admire your confidence, Ms. Quinn, but I must warn you; Stanley might shatter it. I suggest you take your time and plan carefully. How about two years?""

Two years? I'd wrapped up five jobs in that time. Experience told me no target took me more than three months.

I shot back firmly, ""I don't have time to drag out one job. Three months is plenty.""

Mrs. Finn smiled and picked up a shopping bag beside her. ""I hope you've got what it takes.""

Using the information Mrs. Finn provided, I reached out to Stanley. She'd crafted a new identity for me: a graduate from a prestigious university, never been in a relationship, and squeaky clean. High-status men like Stanley were cautious, even when cheating. They preferred women who were pure and posed no complications.

When the call connected, a low, rich ""Hello"" came through, his voice smooth and textured.

I asked, ""Is this Mr. Finn?""

His tone was flat, unreadable. ""Who's this?""

I used a soft, teasing voice that men couldn't help but find intriguing. ""I'm the assistant your wife hired. My name's Helena Quinn. Today; ""

""Do you know Eastwind Road?"" Stanley cut me off.

My unfinished sentence died in my throat.

I glanced around, getting my bearings. ""I know it, but I'm not familiar with the area.""

He gave a faint hum. ""Come now.""

I stared at my phone's dark screen, sizing up Stanley from our brief exchange. Decisive, charmless, and distant. He was no easy mark. I pulled out my lipstick, applied a layer, then wiped most of it off, leaving just a hint of soft pink. When dealing with a sharp man like Stanley, I couldn't be too casual and seem sloppy, nor too polished and come off as scheming. Balance was key. I touched up my makeup, spritzed on some perfume, and drove straight to Eastwind Road.

It was dusk, the sky ablaze like fire. From the bustling crowds to the towering buildings, the city seemed endless. I crossed an overpass, parked outside a convenience store, and lowered my window, my gaze settling on the Sean Group's office building. In the orange-red glow, I spotted a solitary figure, much like the one in the photo. Cold and detached, he stood untouched by the noisy chaos around him. He toyed with a small object, and across the sea of cars, a metallic flick of his fingers caught the light.

As I turned off the engine, I saw it was a lighter.

In person, Stanley was even more striking than in the photos.

He wore a cream-colored turtleneck, the collar just covering his Adam's apple, subtly provocative. His gray wool coat hung open, revealing tailored black trousers. Every inch of him radiated mature sophistication. His eyes, deep and enigmatic, were like the quietest night; one glance, and you'd be pulled in.

If most men were a cup of tea, Stanley was a shot of hard liquor. Potent, intoxicating, with a hint of danger and spice. At first glance, he seemed reserved, but a closer look revealed a thrilling edge. He wasn't conventionally handsome but had a rugged charm that grew on you. Among the men I'd dealt with, Stanley had the most commanding presence. His features carried a brooding intensity, the kind that hinted at insatiable ambition, whether for wealth, power, or passion. I suspected he wasn't truly indifferent to romance; he was just a master at hiding his hypocrisy and desires. Even his wife, Amanda Sean, likely hadn't seen through him.

I realized I might have met my match.

With Stanley's status and looks, women probably threw themselves at him constantly. He was likely immune to flirtation. Men who were sleazy or overly formal were easy to hook, but disciplined, worldly types like Stanley were the toughest nuts to crack.

I took a deep breath, stepped out of the car, and hurried across the street to stand before him. ""Sorry, Mr. Finn, I'm late.""

Stanley glanced at me, his face blank. ""You're not late. I just got here.""

I insisted on taking the blame. ""Arriving after my boss is an unforgivable mistake.""

He was adjusting his cufflinks, but my apology made his fingers pause. He chuckled. ""You're quite something.""

Stanley climbed the steps, a breeze carrying the faint scent of alcohol, as if he'd just come from a business dinner. I followed him into the elevator, where he pressed the button for the 11th floor, his tone casual. ""How did my wife find you?""

I studied his reflection in the elevator doors. He sensed it and met my gaze. Our eyes locked, and Stanley's stare carried an intense, inescapable pressure.

I answered calmly, ""A friend of Mrs. Finn's was my college mentor. He recommended me.""

A faint, unreadable smile flickered in his eyes. ""Is that so?""

I smoothly changed the subject. ""Mrs. Finn said you're devoted to your work, often too busy to rest. That's why she hired me to assist you.""

Stanley stood tall, his eyes fixed on the rising floor numbers, silent.

In my mind, I reassessed Stanley, who was cunning, inscrutable, and likely wary of anyone Amanda sent. My odds of success were less than fifty percent.

Chapter 2 Am I Handsome

In my first few days on the job, I tried every trick in the book to get close to Stanley, but he kept me at arm's length, giving me no chance to connect. If I pushed too hard with bold moves, I risked tipping him off, so I shifted my focus to his secretary, Ms. Webb. I got on her good side, convincing her to let me deliver all the files to the chairman's office, creating opportunities to interact with Stanley.

After I walked into his office with a stack of documents for the umpteenth time, Stanley frowned. ""You again?""

I met his gaze without flinching. ""Ms. Webb's tied up with other tasks, so I'm filling in.""

Stanley rubbed his temples and took the folder from me. ""Thanks for the effort.""

I knew this was his polite way of dismissing me, but I played dumb. ""Mr. Finn, what should I call you?""

He signed a document without looking up. ""Whatever you want.""

I softened my voice, letting it drip with charm. ""Everyone calls you Mr. Finn, but I don't like blending in with the crowd. How about I call you Stanley? Is that okay?""

Stanley flipped to the next page. ""It's just a name. Doesn't matter.""

I glanced at the row of books on the shelf behind him. ""Do you read foreign novels in your free time?""

He started on another file. ""They're just for show.""

I seized the chance to keep the conversation going. ""I read The Passionate Lover, and I was hooked on the main characters' fiery romance. They didn't care about society's rules or what people thought. They followed their impulses, living freely in their desires.""

Stanley loosened his tie with one hand. ""The books are there, but I don't read them. I disagree with that mindset. Self-control is the highest virtue."" He signed the last document and closed the folder. ""Anything else?""

The ""confidante"" approach wasn't working with Stanley, so it was time to pull out the big guns. I leaned forward slightly, eyeing the calendar on his desk. As if by accident, my blouse's top button caught on its edge, popping open two buttons. One rolled across the desk, landing near Stanley's hand. Feigning ignorance, I locked eyes with him, my gaze laced with subtle allure. ""Stanley, as your assistant, I need to know your preferences, like the food you dislike, or your taste. Can you give me some pointers?""

He looked at me calmly, saying nothing.

My posture accentuated the curve of my hips and waist, as if I were already entwined with him, exuding charm with every move. ""I hope everything about me will satisfy you completely. Like…"" My fingers brushed his right hand, barely touching. ""…like your right hand caressing your left, knowing exactly what you want.""

Stanley was sensitive to such hints. His eyes flicked briefly to the glimpse of skin revealed by my open blouse. I didn't show too much; too much would be tacky. It was just enough to tease, to leave him wanting more. His face remained impassive, unlike most men who would gawk openly, their greed plain as day.

He pulled his hand away. ""I don't have time to coach you.""

After his rejection, I put on an Oscar-worthy performance. My eyes shimmered with a mix of hope, sadness, excitement, and disappointment. ""Whenever you have time to guide me, I'll be ready to listen.""

My pitiful act had zero effect on Stanley. He shut me down again, mercilessly. ""I'm never free.""

He picked up a stack of acquisition documents from the corner of his desk and started reviewing them. ""You can go.""

I held my pose for a few more seconds, finally accepting defeat. I had set a new personal record; after I had reeled in so many big fish, this was the first time one had slipped the hook and splashed me with water instead. Swallowing my frustration, I straightened up, adjusted my skirt, and headed for the door. Just then, Stanley called out, ""Hold on.""

My heart skipped a beat. He was a man, after all. How could any man resist such a tempting offer? I quickly masked my excitement, turning back with an innocent look. ""Mr. Finn, are you free now?""

Stanley asked, ""How old are you?""

Caught off guard, I answered, ""Twenty-six.""

He nodded. ""A great age.""

With that, Stanley went back to work as if nothing had happened.

Ninety-nine percent of my targets fell after three calculated moves, but Stanley was the one percent exception. So far, our conversations had stayed strictly professional. He wouldn't even veer slightly off course, let alone stray completely. I had dealt with a few men who played the ""upright"" card before, and they were tough to crack, but none were as challenging as Stanley.

For the next day and a half, I didn't even see Stanley. He was off inspecting an acquisition deal in a nearby city, accompanied by Ashley. Normally, a boss on a business trip would bring a personal assistant to handle small tasks, but Stanley hadn't even considered me. I worried I had lost his favor before I had even gained it. To my surprise, the next evening, he contacted me, asking me to meet him at the Royal Chateau.

On the way to the winery, I called Amanda to update her on my progress. She dampened my spirits. ""Don't get too excited. Stanley's a master at staying detached while toying with others.""

I held the phone in one hand, steering with the other. ""Mrs. Finn, what your husband's good at, I'm just as good at.""

Amanda replied, ""Ms. Quinn, you're doing better than I expected. You might pull this off with Stanley.""

She hung up, and I soon arrived at the Royal Chateau.

Following Stanley's instructions, I found private room 3301. When I entered, another man, in his early forties, was there, discussing the acquisition with Stanley. I approached. ""Stanley.""

Stanley paused their conversation and looked at me. ""Do you drink?""

A man asking a woman if she drinks is the same as inviting her to a late-night movie; it's a loaded question. Maybe Amanda had overestimated Stanley. He wasn't impenetrable after all.

I gave a half-hesitant, half-flirtatious look. ""I tend to overdo it, and then my legs get wobbly.""

Stanley said, ""Then don't drink. Stand by and wait for my instructions.""

Caught off guard, I clenched my fist. ""Yes, Stanley.""

The other man clinked glasses with Stanley. ""I heard Christian Miller's trying to muscle in on this acquisition.""

Stanley swirled his wine glass. ""My wife's uncle is always stirring trouble. He's got a big appetite.""

The man said, ""It's up to you to keep him in check.""

Stanley narrowed his eyes at the wine. ""He's no match for me.""

I let out a soft laugh from the side. I had a knack for reading people, especially men. Stanley was undeniably arrogant about women, and about business. A healthy dose of confidence meant strategic brilliance, but too much could lead to costly mistakes. Given Stanley's position and the fact that even his wife couldn't outmaneuver him, he fell into the ""strategic brilliance"" category.

My laugh caught the attention of the man across from Stanley. He studied me under the room's lighting. ""New secretary?""

Stanley smiled and clarified, ""A personal assistant my wife picked out.""

The man laughed heartily. ""She must be exactly your type.""

Stanley toyed thoughtfully with an unlit cigarette. ""She's fine. Not too bright, not too dull.""

The man said, ""She reminds me of my dream girl from back in the day.""

""Really?"" Stanley's interest piqued. He turned to me. ""What's your name?""

I'd been around him for nearly a week, and he still hadn't remembered my name. It wasn't that Stanley had a bad memory; on the contrary, his recall was top-notch in business dealings. He just didn't care about anything beyond money and power.

I answered, ""Helena Quinn.""

Stanley took a sip of wine and didn't ask anything else.

The drinking session wrapped up at ten. I followed Stanley out, and he slid into the back seat of the car while I took the front passenger seat. Stanley lit a cigarette, his presence heavy with silence. I didn't know his address, so I told the driver to take him home as usual. Normally, with a driver handling things, I wouldn't need to tag along, but this was a rare opportunity, and I wasn't about to let it slip.

As the driver navigated the streets, I adjusted the rearview mirror to steal a glance at Stanley.

He looked different tonight, radiating an indescribable aura.

The city's neon lights and shadows danced across his face, cigarette smoke curling around him, making him appear both stern and chillingly aloof. I was used to seeing Stanley in formal suits, his demeanor all business. But tonight, in a bold purple-red shirt paired with a leather coat, his short hair styled with gel into a sharp, confident look, he was strikingly dashing. His collar was slightly undone, his collarbone catching the glow of the streetlights, a cigarette dangling from his lips.

I racked my brain for ways to make the most of this moment. Suddenly, Stanley, who'd been resting with his eyes closed, opened them. He stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray, the ember fading as he spoke. ""Am I handsome?""

I froze, unsure if I'd heard him right. ""What did you say?""

His enigmatic gaze locked onto mine, and he repeated, ""Am I handsome?""

I didn't know how to respond, holding his stare in silence.

Maybe it was the alcohol, but Stanley's eyes carried a hint of intoxication. He leaned forward, closing the distance between us in an instant.

Chapter 3 Feeding Water

Stanley's face was so close to mine, a faint flush of intoxication spreading from his jaw to his brow. I could smell the alcohol on his breath, heady and overwhelming, catching me off guard. His skin was unusually fair for a man, almost translucent in sunlight, but his sharp, angular features balanced out any softness. They say men with thin lips and expressive eyes are fickle and passionate, but there must be exceptions, like Stanley. His eyes were more captivating than any I'd seen, deep and clear. Even with the haze of alcohol, they held a startling calmness that sent a shiver down me.

My voice was husky, my eyes brimming with charm. ""Mr. Finn, you're handsome.""

""How so?""

A serious, brooding man showing a rare glimpse of recklessness was dangerously alluring.

I said, ""Everywhere.""

His face stayed blank. ""Is being handsome an asset for a man?""

I countered, ""Isn't it? Appetite for beauty is human nature. If there were a legendary heartthrob, Mr. Finn, you'd outshine him.""

""Are you drunk, or am I?"" Stanley let out a faint laugh, barely there. ""What does he look like?""

I gestured with my hands. ""The portrait in the book had a long face. Nowhere near as striking as you.""

Stanley's gaze lingered on my lips as they moved. ""You're wearing lipstick.""

Before I could respond, he added, ""My assistant doesn't need that.""

I reached out, smoothing the upturned edge of his collar, my bold gesture creating an intimate vibe. ""If Mr. Finn doesn't like me wearing makeup, I'll skip it tomorrow.""

Stanley glanced at my fingers on his collar and leaned back. ""Everything I don't like, you'll avoid?""

I knew he was warning me to stay in line.

I replied with a double entendre. ""I won't do anything that harms you. But if it's something good for you, and you say you don't like it, maybe you're just saying one thing and feeling another."" I leaned forward, resting my hand on the seat, my fingers brushing near his chest. I couldn't touch him, but the suggestion was more seductive than any contact. ""Men talk tough, but their hearts soften easily.""

But whenever my bf upsets me or whenever there’s tension in the relationship, I’ve resorted to unhealthy coping mechanisms.

I either eat more, or spend more.
I work from 7-4pm. At work I’ll eat granola and yogurt when I get there. A snack and coffee at 9 or 10am and lunch at 1pm and a snack at 2pm. It already feels like I’m not eating healthily in my head. But on days when we’re arguing I’d eat everything before 12 and leave maybe a snack for the afternoon. I have to force myself to not go out and buy a chocolate or something.

And if it’s not that. Then I’m scrolling on my shopping apps and looking for clothes shoes or accessories to buy. Tbf, I usually buy one outfit or one accessory per month bec I put money away in my savings. But when we’re upset at each other I just want to spend and I buy stuff that I’d have in my wishlist for the next month or something sometimes.

Idk what else I can do to cope cause at work all I can do is scroll. Plus I don’t have girl friends who I can talk to since we all drifted and my two good friends that ate left are in another country and the other is battling depression as well.

Life has a peculiar way of teaching us lessons through the most unexpected encounters. One of the most challenging situations we face is when people attempt to paint us as the villain in their story, simply to ease their own conscience about how they treated us.

## The Psychology Behind the Blame Game 🧠

Human nature has an interesting defense mechanism. When someone knows they've wronged another person, their mind often seeks the path of least resistance to avoid guilt. Rather than facing the uncomfortable truth about their actions, they may choose to reframe the narrative, casting you as the antagonist in their personal drama.

This psychological phenomenon isn't malicious by design - it's often unconscious. People create these alternative versions of events to protect their self-image and maintain their emotional equilibrium. Understanding this can be the first step toward finding peace with the situation.

## Recognizing the Pattern 🔍

You might notice this happening when:

- Someone spreads stories about you that don't align with reality
- Former friends or colleagues suddenly become distant after a conflict
- People who wronged you begin treating you as if you were the problem
- Your reputation gets questioned based on one-sided narratives
- Others seem to accept negative portrayals of you without seeking your perspective

These situations can be incredibly frustrating and hurtful. The natural response is often to defend yourself, to set the record straight, or to fight back against these false narratives.

## The Liberation in Letting Go 🕊️

Here's where the real wisdom lies: sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is simply let it go. This doesn't mean becoming a doormat or accepting mistreatment. Instead, it means choosing not to carry the emotional burden of other people's guilt and their subsequent actions.

When you release the need to correct every misconception or defend against every false narrative, you free up mental and emotional energy for more productive pursuits. You stop being a prisoner to other people's opinions and start living according to your own values and understanding of truth.

## Practical Steps for Daily Life 💪

### Morning Reflection
Start each day by reminding yourself that you cannot control how others perceive you, but you can control how you respond to their perceptions. Take five minutes each morning to focus on your intentions for the day, independent of external validation.

### The 24-Hour Rule
When someone tries to make you the villain in their story, give yourself 24 hours before responding. Often, the urge to immediately defend yourself will diminish, and you'll gain clarity about whether a response is truly necessary.

### Documentation vs. Obsession
Keep records of important interactions and events, but don't let documentation become an obsession. Write things down for your own clarity, not as ammunition for future battles.

### Choose Your Battles Wisely
Not every false narrative deserves your attention. Ask yourself: ""Will correcting this matter in five years?"" If the answer is no, consider letting it go.

### Build Your Support Network
Surround yourself with people who know your true character. These individuals will serve as your reality check when others try to distort your image.

## The Ripple Effect of Understanding 🌊

When you stop fighting every battle and start choosing your responses more deliberately, something interesting happens. You become less reactive and more intentional. This shift in your behavior often confuses those who were expecting you to engage in drama or conflict.

Your calm response to their attempts at casting you as the villain can actually serve as a mirror, forcing them to confront their own actions without you having to say a word. Sometimes, the best defense is simply living well and continuing to be the person you know yourself to be.

## Building Emotional Resilience 🛡️

Developing the ability to let go of other people's narratives requires emotional resilience. This isn't something you build overnight - it's a skill that develops through practice and self-awareness.

### Daily Practices for Resilience:

**Mindful Breathing**: When you feel triggered by someone's attempt to rewrite history, take ten deep breaths before responding. This simple practice can prevent reactive decisions you might later regret.

**Perspective Taking**: Try to understand why someone might need to cast you as the villain. Often, it has more to do with their own pain than with anything you've actually done.

**Self-Validation**: Develop a strong internal compass for right and wrong. Don't rely solely on external validation to know your worth or the validity of your actions.

**Boundary Setting**: Learn to distinguish between situations that require your response and those that don't. Not every provocation deserves your energy.

## The Long-Term Benefits 📈

Living this way - choosing understanding over confrontation, release over resentment - creates several long-term benefits:

You develop a reputation for being level-headed and mature. People begin to trust your judgment more because you're not constantly embroiled in drama. Your mental health improves because you're not carrying the weight of everyone else's guilt and projection.

Most importantly, you model a different way of being in the world. Others observe how you handle conflict and misrepresentation, and some may choose to adopt similar approaches in their own lives.

## When Professional Relationships Are Involved 💼

The workplace can be particularly challenging when it comes to these dynamics. Here's how to navigate professional situations:

**Document Objectively**: Keep records of meetings, decisions, and interactions without emotional commentary. Let the facts speak for themselves.

**Communicate Professionally**: If you must address false narratives in a work context, stick to facts and avoid emotional language. Focus on how the situation impacts work outcomes rather than personal feelings.

**Seek Mediation When Necessary**: If workplace dynamics become toxic due to false narratives, consider involving HR or a neutral third party rather than trying to handle everything yourself.

**Protect Your Reputation Strategically**: Sometimes you do need to correct misconceptions, especially if they could impact your career. Choose these moments carefully and handle them professionally.

## The Broader Life Philosophy 🌍

This approach to handling false narratives is really about adopting a broader philosophy of personal responsibility and emotional freedom. You take responsibility for your own actions and reactions while refusing to take responsibility for other people's guilt, projections, or need to rewrite history.

This doesn't mean you never stand up for yourself or that you accept all treatment passively. It means you choose your responses based on what serves your long-term well-being rather than your immediate emotional reactions.

## Building This Muscle Over Time 💪

Like any skill, learning to let go of other people's narratives takes practice. Start small. The next time someone makes a minor comment that casts you in an unfavorable light, practice the pause. Take a breath. Ask yourself if responding will actually change anything meaningful.

As you build this capacity with smaller situations, you'll find it easier to apply the same principles to larger conflicts and more significant misrepresentations.

## Creating Positive Momentum 🚀

When you stop spending energy on defending against false narratives, you free up that energy for creating positive momentum in your life. You can focus on:

- Building meaningful relationships with people who appreciate your authentic self
- Pursuing goals and projects that align with your values
- Developing skills and knowledge that serve your long-term vision
- Contributing positively to your community and the world around you

This positive focus tends to attract more positive experiences and relationships, creating an upward spiral that naturally counteracts any negative narratives others might try to promote.

## The Wisdom of Time ⏰

Remember that time has a way of revealing truth. People who consistently try to make others the villain in their stories eventually develop a pattern that others begin to recognize. Meanwhile, your consistent, mature responses to conflict will speak volumes about your character.

Years from now, when emotions have cooled and perspectives have shifted, the truth of situations often becomes much clearer to everyone involved. Your choice to take the high road today will be vindicated by the passage of time.

## A Personal Revolution 🔄

Choosing to release people from your need for them to acknowledge their wrongs is ultimately a personal revolution. It's a decision to stop allowing other people's guilt, shame, or need for self-justification to control your emotional state.

This revolution starts within you but has the potential to influence everyone around you. When you stop participating in the drama of blame and counter-blame, you create space for more authentic, meaningful interactions.

## Moving Forward with Purpose 🎯

The ultimate goal isn't to become passive or to accept all treatment without question. The goal is to become more intentional about where you invest your emotional energy and how you respond to conflict.

Every day presents opportunities to practice this approach. Someone cuts you off in traffic and then acts like you're the aggressive driver. A colleague takes credit for your idea and then acts like you're being territorial when you're disappointed. A family member rewrites the history of a conflict to make themselves look better.

In each of these moments, you have a choice. You can engage in the drama, defend your position, and try to force others to acknowledge their actions. Or you can take a breath, recognize what's happening, and choose a response that serves your long-term well-being and peace of mind.

## The Ripple Effect on Others 🌟

When you consistently choose understanding over confrontation, something beautiful happens. You become a safe person for others to be around. People sense that you won't make them the villain in your story, even if conflicts arise. This creates deeper, more authentic relationships.

Your approach also gives others permission to handle their own conflicts more maturely. You become a model for how to navigate disagreements and misunderstandings without destroying relationships or creating unnecessary drama.

## Conclusion: The Freedom in Understanding 🗝️

At the end of the day, understanding why people sometimes need to cast others as villains is an act of emotional intelligence that serves everyone involved. It doesn't excuse poor behavior or mean you should accept mistreatment. Instead, it offers a path toward emotional freedom and more authentic living.

When you release people from your need for their acknowledgment, validation, or apology, you reclaim your power. You stop being a victim of their guilt and start being the author of your own emotional experience.

This is perhaps one of the most practical skills you can develop for a fulfilling life. It applies to every relationship, every conflict, and every situation where human ego and emotion intersect with truth and accountability.

The invitation is simple: the next time someone tries to make you the villain in their story, take a breath, understand what's happening, and choose your response from a place of wisdom rather than reaction. Your future self will thank you for the peace and energy you preserved by making this choice.

Is it worth having some researcher study it?,"I can smell some medical conditions and illnesses. I’ve always been this way, at least for as long as I can remember. No injury, migraines, headaches, pregnancy, or other things going on (or being bitten by a radioactive medical-alert dog).

Strep throat: smells like yeast bread and sweaty-hand holding coins for too long combined.
Ear infections: smell like Camembert cheese
Dangerously low blood sugar smells like chemical cleaner and rotten pears.
High blood sugar: smells like pla filament in a 3d printer, flat-sweet-neutral.
Pregnancy, as early as 3 weeks: this one’s harder to explain. Have you ever peeled the skin off of a grape and just eaten that without the fruit part? Take that taste and turn it into a smell. I’ve gotten in weird situations multiple times for saying something before they knew they were pregnant.
Chemotherapy leaves a lingering burnt-urine smell. It’s humbling to be angry at someone who darted into the parking spot you were waiting for, having all the mean thoughts, then waiting behind them in line at Dillards and smell the chemo.

I can “smell the sick” for a lot of other illnesses and infections, but it seems to only be for bacterial or fungal ones. Viruses don’t give off a smell I pick up I guess. 🤷‍♀️ don’t know if it is a good or a bad thing I can’t smell Covid.

I’m in data science now, but I was working in public education for 8 years before that. My first year teaching, one of my second graders had frequent seizures with two distinct kinds. The most common was absence/zoning out for 30-60 seconds. I’d get a 10-15 minute warning with a minty-sweat smell. I could catch it from the other side of the classroom. The other kind of seizure was much more rare, tonic (zombie arms would go out parallel to the ground) and she would temporarily go completely blind for the next 1-4 hours. Those ones I never knew they were coming, there was no smell.

This isn’t even a full list. I have dozens more that are distinct from one another as much as tomatoes, coffee, and cinnamon are.

Now I’m just going about life feeling like a poorly trained alert dog with social anxiety. I’ve been in the grocery store, caught a smell of minty-seizure-warning walking by a complete stranger. Then awkwardly staying in sight of them and a few minutes later they’re on the ground. (Found out it was POTS passing out and not a seizure)

I visited Taiwan and Hong Kong in the first two weeks of April from Sydney, Australia.  My plan was a much more relaxed version of many of the itineraries - Taipei for a week and Tainan for 4 days, with some small day trips. I ended up visiting Jiufen, Tamsui, and Kaohsiung through public transport, which I felt gave me a more rounded view of Taiwan. I didn't visit the East Coast or Alishan due to time frames and cost.

**Budget -** I spent around $160 AUD per day, including hostel accommodation. I did a bit of shopping and wasn't huge on limiting myself to not eat somewhere or do something because of cost. I spent around $4000 AUD for the whole trip including $1200 flights from Sydney.

**Taipei - 6 nights**

Taipei is such an incredible cosmopolitan city with tonnes to do! I stayed in two different locations - Zhongxiao Dunhua in the East and then Zhongshan in the centre near Taipei Main Station. Both great places and each offering different vibes. Taipei is great as you can stay almost anywhere as long as it's near the metro.

Speaking of the MRT, it's (once again) clean, on-time and very affordable! You can buy fun EasyCards to load your money on, but I believe you can soon download the EasyCard to use on your phone like a Suica card.

There are a number of musuems across the city, lots of shopping, historical sites, and food and drink places to explore. Also, there is a lot of greenery and nature to see dotted around the city, though Da'an Park is an excellent place to explore and people watch.

**Tainan - 4 nights**

I loved Tainan! It felt very refreshing and laid-back after Taipei, which could sometimes feel busy and crowded. Tainan is further south and brings warmer weather and different food, more welcoming and friendly people, but *far worse* public transport. I stayed in the centre of Tainan which was close to food spots and many attractions, but I did need to catch a bus for around 20-30 minutes to Anping Fort on the Western side of the city. You can catch the HSR there from Taipei, or slower trains. It's also only a short trip to Kaohsiung. Tainan has great food and good coffee - also a lot of smaller shops and markets that do lush food. I ate incredibly well there!

**Day Trips**

**Kaohsiung - 1 day**

I only did a day trip here and I'm super glad I didn't stay overnight here. I just didn't enjoy the city, and found a lot of the activities to do felt lacklustre and more like things to take pictures of, rather than explore or learn from. However, Sanfong Temple was incredbile!

**Jiufen - 1 day**

Contrary to popular opinion, I liked Jiufen - but it was super crowded at some points. I caught the bus from Taipei on a solo day-trip and arrived to the main old street while most stalls were still closed or just opening. I managed to snag a famous peanut cilantro ice cream in a wrap with no queue (wasn't actually a fan in the end)! The joy in Jiufen was exploring outside the main tourist area. I wandered up the hills to visit a temple next to a fire station, grab a coffee and look out over Teapot Mountain, and wander to the most gorgeous temple that overlooked the sea. If I had just stuck to the main street, I would've hated it.

**Tamsui - .5 a day**

I'm unsure if this is fully a day trip, but I spent half a day in the seaside town and really enjoyed myself. The riverside pier is full of people happy and enjoying themselves, and the San Domingo Fort is interesting and set out well. Some great little food spots too. I tried to hire a YouBike to ride cheaply along the river but alas, my card didn't work in the app.

**Hong Kong - 2.5 days**

I LOVE Hong Kong. I'm desperate to go back. It is so easy to navigate, explore and enjoy. Does it have an overabundance of touirst attractions to do and see - not really, but it's a city to wander, sit down and soak it in. Except the coffee is ridiculously expensive (at least it's good). I stayed in Sham Shui Po and got to see bits and pieces of life there, and then spent time over in Mid-levels and Sheung Wan on what was essentially an express tour using the dingdings. I have so much more on my list to see there!

Does it hurt when you sit down? Maybe it's a specific type of a chair that hurts after a while? 

Do your symptoms come on when you drink or eat something? Perhaps it's coffee, or fizzy drinks, or alcohol?

Do you have flare ups after you masturbate or have sex? But notice that there is a delay in the pain or symptoms? (Couple of minutes - several hours later?)

Does something like chlorinated water (pools or pots tubs) trigger your symptoms to get worse? 

Think of all the things that reliably activate or worsen your symptoms. Now, see if you can find any exceptions to these:

**Example:**
>Sometimes when I'm really distracted or having fun, sitting doesn't make my symptoms worse.

**Example:** 
>My ejaculation pain/discomfort only occurs a few minutes or hours later, or even the next day.

**Example:**
>One time when I was drinking with my friends, going in the hot tub didn't cause me any discomfort.

This immediately tells us that there is something **strange** going on. Structural damage, injuries, and infections don't change based on our attention, or, *hurt with a delay* when doing a physical activity that uses that body part (sex, masturbation). Think about spraining your ankle and then going on a run. Ouch!

If you can think of *any* exceptions to your symptom triggers like this, feel free to proceed with today's experiment. 

**Note:** *Even if you do not have a known exception, there is still a chance that this is a conditioned response.*

**Disclaimer:** *Do not attempt this activity unless you feel secure in your ability to handle your pelvic symptoms when/if they come on.*

Close your eyes. Slow your breath down. Just notice how the breath feels coming and going from the body for a bit. 

# Now imagine in as much detail as you can:  

The movement, the position, the food, the drink or the activity that worsens or triggers your symptoms. Lean into all of your senses for a solid minute: Touch, sight, smell, sound, taste. 

And, notice as you're doing this, what's going on in your body. Do you feel a sense of fear? Anxiety? Are you noticing any pain or sensations coming on? 

If they do, I want you to *smile to yourself* knowing that you just found out what the real cause of your symptom is, a conditioned response that exists as a neural pathway in the brain. What we just did is called a ,""provocative test"" - A visualization tool we use in PRT (Pain Reprocessing Therapy) to determine if someone has a conditioned response. 

Take a few slow, easy deep breaths, and relax your body into whatever this sensation is, whether it's an emotion like fear, or the pain itself. Let it be there, and smile knowing that you just won. Bring on a sense of empowerment.

This is only possible because the same brain regions that activate when doing something physically with our bodies, *also activate from visualization.*

# What exactly just happened?

A Pavlovian response, also known as classical conditioning, is a type of learning where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, leading to a learned response. This was famously demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov through his experiments with dogs, where he paired the sound of a bell (neutral stimulus) with the presentation of food (meaningful stimulus). Eventually, the dogs would salivate (learned response) at the sound of the bell alone. 

We now understand that the same thing can happen with chronic pain. People with an overprotective (sensitized) central nervous system can develop learned associations (conditioned responses) with neutral stimuli, like sitting, drinking, or masturbation, from *past experiences and knowledge.*

This is possible because of something called ""predictive processing"" or ""predictive coding."" Upwards of ~40% of our unconscious brain function is dedicated to this process. Predictive coding is a computational model of how the brain works - that the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on prediction errors. The brain is constantly generating predictions about incoming sensory information based on *prior knowledge and experience*

What made a huge difference for me is to follow an advise I saw here, on Reddit, that recommended to use much-much lower temperatures than V60 pours. So, I'm never in my nineties, almost always in low-mid 80s. That, consistently gives me a cup that is not flat and overburned at least.

grind sizes from 2 to 8 on fellow Opus, temperatures, a few different beans, tryed over and under dosing the recipes, tried community profiles as a starting point, tried GPT made recipes, different filters (original fellow and cheap ones (no real difference), temperature ranges, blom times and temps..

*Transform toxic interactions into opportunities for growth and peace*

---

## The Reality Check We All Need 🎯

We've all been there. That one person who finds the cloud in every silver lining, the problem in every solution, the disaster in every opportunity. Whether it's your cubicle neighbor, your family member at dinner tables, or that team member who turns brainstorming sessions into complaint festivals – dealing with chronically negative people is an inevitable part of human existence.

The question isn't whether you'll encounter them (you will), but how you'll handle these interactions without losing your sanity, productivity, or inner peace.

## Understanding the Negativity Magnet 🧲

Before diving into solutions, let's understand what we're dealing with. Chronically negative individuals aren't necessarily bad people. Often, they're stuck in patterns that served them at some point but now create barriers to meaningful connections and progress.

These individuals typically exhibit:
- Automatic pessimistic responses to new ideas
- Tendency to focus on what's wrong rather than what's working  
- Resistance to change, even positive ones
- Energy that seems to drain rather than energize others
- Conversation patterns that loop back to problems without exploring solutions

The key insight? Their negativity usually stems from fear, past disappointments, or learned helplessness rather than malicious intent.

## The Mirror Method: Reflecting Without Absorbing 🪞

One of the most effective approaches is what we'll call the Mirror Method. Instead of absorbing their negativity or fighting against it, you reflect it back in a transformed way.

**How it works:**
When they say: ""This project will never work, just like the last three failures.""
You respond: ""I hear that you're concerned about repeating past challenges. What specific element from those experiences could we address differently this time?""

This technique acknowledges their concern without accepting their conclusion. You're not dismissing their feelings, but you're also not letting their negativity become your reality.

**Daily Application:**
Practice this during your morning coffee conversations, team meetings, or family discussions. The goal is to become a transformative mirror – reflecting their concerns back as opportunities for problem-solving rather than reasons for surrender.

## The Boundary Blueprint 🚧

Emotional boundaries aren't walls – they're filters. They allow positive interactions while screening out toxic energy transfers.

**The Three-Layer System:**

**Layer 1 - Time Boundaries:** Limit the duration of negative conversations. ""I have 10 minutes to discuss this challenge and explore one potential solution.""

**Layer 2 - Topic Boundaries:** Redirect repetitive complaints. ""We've covered this concern. Let's focus on what we can actually influence today.""

**Layer 3 - Energy Boundaries:** Protect your emotional state. After difficult interactions, take five minutes to reset your mental space through brief walks, deep breathing, or positive self-talk.

These boundaries aren't about being cold or uncaring – they're about maintaining your ability to be genuinely helpful rather than becoming another casualty of the negativity cycle.

## The Curiosity Catalyst 🔍

Transform complaints into investigations. Instead of defending against negative statements, become genuinely curious about the underlying concerns.

**Practical Phrases:**
- ""Help me understand what you're most worried about here.""
- ""What would need to change for you to feel more confident about this?""
- ""When you imagine this working well, what would that look like?""

This approach does something powerful – it shifts the conversation from problem-focused to solution-oriented without dismissing their concerns. You're not trying to convince them to be positive; you're inviting them to be constructive.

**Real-World Example:**
Team member: ""These new procedures are just more bureaucracy that will slow us down.""
You: ""What aspects of efficiency are you most concerned about losing? Let's map out how we could maintain those while meeting the new requirements.""

## The Patience Investment Strategy 💰

Think of dealing with negative people as a long-term investment rather than a quick transaction. Some individuals need consistent, patient interaction before they begin to shift their patterns.

**The 90-Day Approach:**
- Weeks 1-30: Focus on consistent, boundary-respectful interaction
- Weeks 31-60: Look for small signs of openness to alternative perspectives  
- Weeks 61-90: Gradually introduce more collaborative problem-solving

This timeline respects the reality that behavioral changes take time, especially for deeply ingrained patterns. Your consistency during this period often matters more than any single brilliant response.

## Environmental Design for Positivity 🌱

Sometimes the solution isn't changing the person – it's changing the environment that enables their negativity to dominate.

**Workplace Applications:**
- Structure meetings with specific time limits for problem identification and mandatory time for solution brainstorming
- Create anonymous suggestion systems for concerns, paired with public recognition for constructive contributions
- Design team projects that require collaborative problem-solving rather than individual criticism

**Family Applications:**  
- Establish dinner table rules: each problem shared must be paired with one thing that went well that day
- Create family decision-making processes that include both concern-raising and idea-generating phases
- Plan activities that naturally foster cooperation and shared positive experiences

## The Emotional Aikido Technique 🥋

In martial arts, aikido uses an opponent's force and redirects it rather than meeting it head-on. The same principle applies to emotional interactions.

When someone approaches you with negative energy, instead of pushing back (creating conflict) or pulling away (creating distance), you redirect that energy toward something constructive.

**The Four-Step Redirect:**
1. **Acknowledge:** ""I can see this situation is frustrating for you.""
2. **Validate the feeling:** ""It makes sense that you'd be concerned about potential problems.""  
3. **Redirect the focus:** ""Given these concerns, what would be the most important thing to address first?""
4. **Invite collaboration:** ""How can we work together to tackle that specific issue?""

This isn't about manipulation – it's about creating space for genuine problem-solving while honoring their emotional reality.

## The Success Documentation Method 📊

Negative individuals often suffer from selective memory – they remember failures vividly but forget successes quickly. You can help interrupt this pattern through strategic success documentation.

**How to implement:**
- Keep a shared record of project wins, positive outcomes, and successful problem-solving
- Reference specific past successes when current challenges arise
- Create regular review sessions that highlight progress and positive developments
- Use concrete examples rather than general positive statements

""Remember how concerned we were about the client presentation last month? The feedback we received exceeded our expectations, especially on the sections you helped refine.""

This approach provides evidence-based optimism rather than empty cheerleading.

## The Selective Engagement Protocol 🎯

Not every negative comment deserves a response. Learning when to engage and when to let things pass is crucial for your mental energy and effectiveness.

**Engage When:**
- The negativity relates to legitimate problems you can help solve
- Your input could prevent actual damage or missed opportunities  
- The person shows genuine openness to alternative perspectives
- The situation directly affects your responsibilities or relationships

**Let It Pass When:**
- The complaint is repetitive without new information
- The person seems committed to the problem rather than interested in solutions
- Engaging would likely escalate rather than improve the situation
- Your energy would be better invested elsewhere

## Building Your Support Network 🤝

Dealing with chronically negative people shouldn't be a solo mission. Build relationships with others who can provide perspective, encouragement, and practical advice.

**Network Components:**
- **The Realist:** Someone who can help you assess whether concerns raised are legitimate
- **The Optimist:** A person who helps you maintain perspective and hope
- **The Strategist:** Someone skilled at navigating difficult personalities and situations
- **The Listener:** A trusted individual who provides emotional support without judgment

Regular check-ins with your support network help prevent you from absorbing negativity or losing your own emotional balance.

## The Long-Term Perspective 🔭

Remember that your goal isn't to transform every negative person into an optimist. That's neither realistic nor necessary. Your goal is to:

- Maintain your own emotional health and productivity
- Contribute positively to shared environments and relationships
- Model constructive approaches to challenges
- Create space for genuine collaboration when possible
- Protect others from unnecessary exposure to toxic patterns

Sometimes the kindest thing you can do for a chronically negative person is to stop enabling their patterns by consistently responding with boundaries and redirection rather than endless patience for unconstructive complaints.

## Practical Daily Actions You Can Start Today ⚡

**Morning Routine Addition:**
Spend 2 minutes visualizing positive interactions with challenging people in your life. This mental rehearsal prepares you to respond thoughtfully rather than reactively.

**Workplace Implementation:**
Create a ""solution-focused"" email signature or meeting agenda template that naturally guides conversations toward constructive outcomes.

**Family Integration:**  
Introduce a ""problem + possibility"" rule: anyone sharing a concern must also share one potential approach to address it.

**Personal Practice:**
End each day by identifying one interaction with a negative person that you handled well and one thing you could improve tomorrow.

## The Ripple Effect Reality 🌊

Your consistent, thoughtful approach to dealing with negative individuals creates ripples far beyond those direct interactions. Others observe how you handle difficult situations and often adopt similar strategies. You become a model for constructive engagement that can slowly shift entire family dynamics, team cultures, or social environments.

This isn't about being perfect – it's about being intentional. Every interaction is an opportunity to either perpetuate negative cycles or interrupt them with something more constructive.

---

The journey of dealing with chronically negative people is ongoing, requiring patience, skill, and self-care. But it's also an opportunity to develop resilience, emotional intelligence, and leadership abilities that will serve you throughout your life.

Remember: you cannot control their negativity, but you can absolutely control your response to it. That response has the power to protect your wellbeing, maintain your effectiveness, and sometimes even create space for positive change in others.

The strategies outlined here aren't just theory – they're practical tools that work in real relationships with real people facing real challenges. Start small, be consistent, and watch as your increased skill in these interactions improves not just your difficult relationships, but your overall quality of life.

Since my last meal was at 6 PM, I was already hungry, and with a bad case of gastritis I needed a quick bite. While waiting for our orders (which I understood would take time given the crowd), I discreetly nibbled on a small leftover burger from my bag.

A staff member kept circling near our table, which I initially assumed was just attentive service. To my surprise, he eventually approached me and insisted I pay a **₱350 corkage fee**. I didn’t argue, since I know corkage exists, but I politely explained my condition and even offered to stop eating. Instead of showing the slightest compassion, he brushed me off with “policy is policy.”

Let’s be real here:

* The staff showed **no empathy** at all, a little understanding or an exemption for health reasons wouldn’t have hurt.
* Charging **₱350 for a leftover burger worth under ₱100** is excessive, as if I’d brought in a full dinner spread. Don’t get me wrong, I understand corkage fees, but at least make them reasonable and proportional.
* To top it all off, their **coffee was bland and overpriced**, relying purely on hype rather than quality.

So here’s the irony: a place named after ""coffee bubbles"" turned out flat no warmth, no hospitality, just disappointment. The whole experience left a sour taste I won’t forget.",1,1756530159.0,u_JPRMCG,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately, I think I ramped up too quickly on the Vyvanse (and also had a cup of coffee) and I was quickly in the fetal position freaking out :( 

I took 10 mg the first day, 20 mg the next two days, and then 30 mg on the fourth day. Since I didnt have any problems the first three days, I thought.. okay, I will begin the actual starting dose and see how it goes. Had a coffee too. BAD MISTAKE. The following day I took 10mg which was okay but I noticed some muscle spasms so I didnt take any Vyvanse today (day 6). I am on 125mg sertraline as well.

I am wondering what other people's experiences were starting on Vyvanse when you have a history of anxiety. How did you relax? The medication totally helped my ADHD, I think I just upped the dose too quickly. The mild muscle twitching has also been freaking me out and not helping the anxiety. Has anyone else had that? I took magnesium and electrolytes and no huge difference. 

I assume that as I get used to the medication the anxiety will subside. Its just the getting there thats the problem. Im not keen on starting a non stimulant because that sort of freaks me out more because it builds up in your system over time. At least with Vyvanse its over in 14 hours if it goes wrong (just anxiety things looool). 

Thank you in advance :)

So I'm moving to Florida specifically to the Tampa/St. Pete area. I'm looking at Clearwater because ideally I want to be as close to the beach as I can, but also close to the Tampa city and I like the fact that Tarpon Springs (I'm Greek) is not too far away as well.

Sometimes relationships can really be like this,"Dating can feel like a wild adventure, but approaching it with authenticity and a warm heart makes all the difference. Be unapologetically yourself—whether you’re a bookworm, a gamer, or someone who loves long hikes with a killer playlist. Share those passions early on; they’re the spark that fuels real connection. Ask questions and genuinely listen to their stories, whether it’s about their favorite anime or a quirky hobby they’re shy about. Showing curiosity builds trust and makes them feel valued.
Small, thoughtful gestures are magic. Remember their go-to coffee order, suggest a low-key picnic at a spot they mentioned, or surprise them with a playlist of songs that remind you of them. These little acts show you’re paying attention, and they often mean more than grand gestures. Don’t feel pressured to rush things—let the relationship unfold naturally, like a good story. Take time to enjoy the moments, whether it’s laughing over a silly board game or debating the best pizza toppings.
At the same time, keep your boundaries clear and respect theirs. It’s okay to say what you’re comfortable with, whether it’s pacing the relationship or how often you text. Check in with yourself to ensure you’re feeling good about the connection, and don’t be afraid to walk away if it doesn’t feel right. Stay open to new experiences, like trying their favorite karaoke spot or exploring a new hiking trail together. Dating is about discovery—of them, of yourself, and of the joy in shared moments. Above all, be kind, have fun, and trust that the right person will appreciate you for exactly who you are.",17,1756529169.0,dating_advice,1,0.95,False
1n3ssr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1n3ssr4/10_takeaways_as_a_reader_for_the_austin_film_fest/,10 Takeaways As A Reader For The Austin Film Fest 2025,"Well well well, another year, another few hundred scripts read for the Austin Film Fest. Last year’s post seemed popular enough to warrant another go at it, so I’ve compiled a few more thoughts on this year’s entrants.



1. **Put yourself In the shoes of the audience**
   1. It’s been said before to write the movie/show you would want to see, and there’s a lot of truth to that, but don’t forget that, ideally, people who are *not us* are going to watch this someday. I’m not talking about trying to generalize for the lowest common denominator, which I think has been an ongoing Hollywood issue, I’m talking about closing your eyes, imagining *you* are a person who just saw what you wrote, and telling their friend about it. If they’re excited about what they saw, why? How would they describe it? Can they easily explain the premise without thinking about it too much? Are there moments that will make them excitedly say “what the fuck??” out loud in the theater? Will people be leaning back in tension during a scary moment and letting out a huge, stress-relieving scream when the scare happens? Do they need a little nudge to help them understand the plot? I personally get very excited while watching my own work through the audience’s eyes, it helps make writing feel more active and less like I’m just getting through the required pages. 
2. **Transitions make a huge difference.** 
   1. It’s something not talked about enough when discussing writing “craft,” though Craig Mazin has mentioned it on his Scriptnotes podcast. It’s incredible how many scenes I would read that just end with no notice, we’re simply not in that scene anymore. Transitions help us know what and how to feel from scene to scene, and they don’t always have to be a big moment or anything, but even just noting a look from a character, a question, or an action, can make a big difference. Often scenes or sequences would end on a line that seemed kinda innocuous, something that didn’t leave me feeling anything in particular. If we were watching this, it’s just like the editor decided “we’re done here” and the next scene would begin. Similarly to the previous note, really close your eyes and watch your movie, did the scene really cut away the moment someone said their line, or was there an extra beat of the other character reacting? It’s one of the reasons why folks will recommend reading novels from time to time, because novelists know they need to end their chapters in a way that clearly feels like we’re wrapping up a moment before moving us on to the next chapter. Speaking of which…
3. **Act breaks mean something.** 
   1. I read a lot of pilots that included act breaks, mostly 5 acts, some only 3. Those act breaks you’re including in the headers aren’t just there as decoration and they aren’t there as some sort of symbolic formality. In fact, the act break heading isn’t the thing that should define an act break at all, t*he action within the script should do that on its own.* If you removed the act break headers altogether, a reader should still feel them, meaning what’s happening in your story should define an act break, not a page number. So many pilots this year had act breaks that were simply there because “this is roughly the page where an act break should go,” but there wasn’t any evidence within the story that we were breaking from one act to another. You can borrow and re-use whatever structure you’d like, but an act break needs to be defined by something we can feel, a change, a decision, a betrayal, a discovery, SOMETHING. This goes with features as well, of course, but typically writers weren’t including act break headers within their features. 
4. **Prove your plot to the reader**
   1. If your character is upset with their love life, feeling lonely, etc., and desperately wants a change, they can’t also be turning down dates left and right. If your character is a standup comedian and they’re hoping they’ll win a standup competition, they need to be incredibly funny. If your character is a detective, and they’re the best at what they do, we need to see them do some mighty fine detective work. There were several scripts this year that basically presented a world with no evidence, or loose evidence at best. It would be like saying your character is the best speller in the world, and their example is that they can spell “irregular.” This kinda extends to the “show, don’t tell” rule, where the worst examples are someone telling us something about the character but not actually showing us anything to prove that. It would be as if GOOD WILL HUNTING had people telling Will he's a genius and never letting us see him writing those iconic equations. 
5. **Your characters don’t have to be “likeable,” but they do have to be** ***interesting.***
   1. I think most would agree that “make your character more likeable” is an awful note. Your character can be a good person and do good things, but that’s not necessarily what makes a good character. You can have a character who hates everyone, a complete misanthrope, someone who would rather kick a cat than to save it, but if you make them *interesting,* you’re on the right track. I read a script where someone hated their family and constantly made fun of them, but they were stuck on a vacation with them. They were cruel, unfunny, over dramatic, and whiny, *and if they were interesting that would all be forgiven*. But they weren’t, they brought nothing to the plot with them, never changed, they weren’t hiding anything, there was nothing bigger under the surface, they weren’t even particularly good at anything, yet somehow they were the center of attention during every scene and someone else fell in love with them immediately, *and I had no idea why.* In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, you’ve got an OCD-laden, misanthropic, bigoted sexist, and he hates dogs. Not very ""likeable"" at all. But you know what he is? *Interesting.* He’s an incredibly talented writer, there’s some deep hurt underneath him, and he’s willing to go to extreme lengths just to keep what he considers “normal” in his life. Another character I read was the favorite cowboy in town. He helped everyone, looked up to by all, he was the best shot (we only know that because another character told him that), *and he was unbelievably boring.* We never got to see how he made decisions, what he struggled with, or if he was particularly good at anything other than pleasantries. Likeable as it gets, not interesting in the least. If you’re at a complete loss at how you can make someone more interesting, just make them very good at something, and then take that thing away. At minimum you’ve got someone who stands out and now needs to relearn how to do what made them interesting in the first place.
6. **Context goes a long way.**
   1. There were a number of scripts this year where a protagonist was going through a major life change, like the death of a parent, a divorce, or maybe being contacted by aliens. Great! Throwing a life-altering wrench at your protagonist is an awesome way to tell a story. The problem is these things all happened before the story began, and without any sort of understanding about who a protagonist was before these extreme events, it’s hard to tell how things have changed for them. MARRIAGE STORY starts in the middle of their divorce, but we're given an incredibly useful ""what I love about \_\_\_\_"" scene that shows everything we need to know about what's at stake with their relationship. Lots of rom-coms take the short cut of “hard working protagonist comes home to find someone fucking their spouse in the first 3 minutes,” which is obviously overdone, but it comes from a place of understanding that it helps to glimpse what “normal” looked like for their characters before the meat of the story really begins. It’s not a hard and fast rule by any means, but it does require a bit of nuance when determining when and how to pull the rug out from the audience. Speaking of which…
7. **Don’t hide the wrong thing.** 
   1. This is going to sound pretty specific, but I wouldn’t bring it up if it didn’t come up in more than one script. Imagine if the pilot for the show GHOSTS withheld any sense that the people Samantha is seeing are ghosts, and we’re left to wonder who the fuck all these people are? Or if it withheld that she had her accident in the first place, but there are just ghosts around. It would make for a confusing watch. Yes, we could consider watching the next episode to get some answers, but these aren’t the answers we should be asking for. Take a pilot like LOST, which is a show all about asking questions and teasing out answers (whether you liked the conclusion or not). They knew what to present to you in order for you to watch the next episode. *But let’s pretend they hid the wrong thing*; what if they withheld that the characters were on a plane at all, and instead we just picked up with them navigating the island with no mention of how they got there? The audience would feel something was missing, like the filmmakers forgot to tell us a crucial part of the joke for the punchline to make any sense. This is what I read in more than one script. There was a mystery here, but it was the wrong mystery. 
8. **Don’t blow your best setups on the pilot.**
   1. So many pilots this year had the potential for some really good set ups that could be paid off mid season or later, like a wife meeting with a divorce lawyer but having second thoughts and a husband secretly taking a mortgage out on their house but backing down at the last minute. By the end of the pilot, this information is revealed and dealt with, water under the bridge, and the plot will moved on like nothing ever happened. It’s such a waste of a set up that could make for some incredible drama down the line, and may very well be the secret weapon you need to keep your series going. If your sci-fi character has a robotic arm and doesn’t talk about it, you really don’t need to answer that in the first episode, that can be a big character moment for them that you can build toward. Imagine if Jaimie Lannister had a heart-to-heart with Ned Stark at the end of the GOT pilot about the truth behind his assassination of the Mad King. Sure, that’s interesting stuff, but instead we get an insane amount of character development from Jaimie through 3 seasons until he’s at his lowest before he reveals his feelings to Brianne. Don’t waste a setup like that. 
9. **Why now?** 
   1. Your plot can’t begin simply because the protagonist decided it should (I read a script that included the protagonist saying “Or maybe… it’s time I make a change?” in the first page), it should be something that happens organically, even better if your protagonist is at odds with it, that way they can choose to become a part of the plot themselves. If you really want to write a series about a young person working in a retirement home, and your pilot is their first day, it shouldn’t be just because they woke up that day and said “you know what? I’m going to work in a retirement home.” There needs to be something that brought them there. Do they have a grandparent who doesn’t remember them, and this is how they get to keep an eye on them? Is this court mandated? Maybe a way to get closer to someone they have a crush on who works there? There's a million ways this could go, as long as the reason why it's happening WHEN it's happening in the script feels like something we can sink our teeth into. 
10. **Things just happen.** 
   1. Recognizing this early will go a long way for scenes that would benefit from some added tension or drama (it works for comedy as well, but we'll get there). Often in these scripts, a character would be put into a situation where they would need to perform an action (rob a house, fix a car, steal a book from a library, feed their friend's fish, whatever) and they would simply... do it. Things would just happen, and then they would be done. Not every scene needs to be a complicated set piece, of course -- your protagonist ordering a coffee doesn't need to be a whole thing (though what/how they order can say something about them, as long as it's not yet another 40+ man ordering a black coffee from a Gen Z-er who has no idea what they're talking about) -- but you don't want to miss an opportunity to really earn the ticket we're potentially paying to see your work. If Character A breaks into Character B's house to steal the Macguffin, and later on Character B finds out they were there, that's an example of ""things just happen."" Character A set out to do a thing, they did it without much hassle, and later Character B learned about it. Fine, that is undeniably plot. But if you're writing a thriller, you have a chance to take advantage of the genre you're writing in. Character A can break into Character B's house, and right when they find the Macguffin Character B can come home early, BUT set Character A in a part of the house where they have no idea Character B is home, and don't let Character B find any evidence that anyone's in their house at all. THEN you've got the audience in the palm of your hand, because they're the only people here who know that both of those characters are in the same house at the same time. You can then tighten that screw to your heart's content, letting those two characters get closer and closer to discovering each other, before you finally release us and allow Character A to escape. 
   2. So what about for comedy? Say your protagonist has a big date, but they get diarrhea in the middle of it (we all remember ALONG CAME POLLY, I'm sure) and needs to leave. That's a scene where things just happen. Yeah you shook things up a little, and it's humorous, but this can be taken further. Remember that writing is often about challenging your characters and giving them a chance to show who they are through how they face (or don't face) a challenge. So what can we do here? We can start by giving the protagonist diarrhea BEFORE they've arrived to the date, so we already have that bomb ticking by the time the scene starts. Now every move they make, every word spoken, is going to come with the added stakes that they might shit themselves. But we're not done, because this is about challenging your characters, and a big thing that can help define your characters is to be specific. So you make them a medical professional, maybe a nurse in training, or an EMT, and their date knows that. You give this medical professional diarrhea before they get to the date, watch them sweat as they desperately attempt to get through it... and then have the person at the table next to them start choking. *Now you've got a medical professional on an important date, desperately trying not to shit themselves, and suddenly they have to choose whether or not to give the Heimlich maneuver to the person next to them because if they do they will absolutely shit themselves.* This is how you take advantage of your genre and ensure that things aren't ""just happening."" 

**Honorable mentions:**

\- Read your script OUT LOUD to catch mistakes.

\- ""We see/hear"" is perfectly fine. If it's good enough for David Koepp, it's good enough for you. 

\- The viewer can't read your script, don't depend on action lines to describe what can't be seen.

\- You might not be able to describe a thought, but you can describe a reaction. *""What the hell?""* in italics, for example. 

\- Speaking of which, generally, if it helps tell your story without breaking screenwriting logic, go for it. 

\- Spacial awareness within a scene is very important. Where are characters in relation to each other? Who's there at the top of the scene? 

\- Don't get caught up in prose. Describing exactly how the sun is feeling on the skin of your protagonist should be rare. 

\- Unless it defines their character, or is important to the scene, leave the wardrobe descriptions out, these get exhausting to read. 

\- Keep the parentheticals of a character intro brief, and generally stick to what we're seeing or feeling about a character. ""She is the most popular girl in school but deep down she feels a little shy, especially since her dad left her mom and everyone knows"" is a no-no.

\- Be smart about what's possible to film/animate. ""His skin is also paper but doesn't reflect light"" is already too difficult to imagine. 

\- Don't get too caught up on hyper-specific physical descriptions of actions. For example, ""she leans on her left arm with her elbow on the table and rests her head in her palm while she holds the phone with her right hand against her ear as she listens..."" is way too much. Leave that for directing.

\- Unless this is your shooting script and you're going over it with your DP, please leave specific shot choices out unless it's really important. Occasionally mentioning something like ""CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN NOTE"" or ""EXTREMELY EXAGGERATED DUTCH ANGLE"" is fine if it helps tell the story, otherwise save it for your storyboards.

1n3ssm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tsitp/comments/1n3ssm7/one_refreshing_change/,One refreshing change,"
In so many teen dramas, the heroine is either never shown eating, or food is only used as a prop - a milkshake at a diner, an untouched salad, a coffee cup in hand while walking down school hallways. It creates this quiet but powerful message that “cool” or “desirable” girls don’t have appetites, that they’re above something as ordinary as being hungry. 

In contrast, Belly actually eats. She asks for food, says she’s hungry, snacks while hanging around the boys, and we see the people around her (Conrad, Jeremiah, Steven, even her mom) making sure she has something to eat. That normalcy makes her feel more real and less like a glossy, airbrushed TV character.

What also stands out is that Belly’s body looks healthy and relatable. She doesn’t fall into that unrealistic “Hollywood teen” mold of being impossibly thin while somehow having the energy to swim, party, cry, dance, and survive heartbreak all summer. Instead, she looks like a normal girl soft in some places, glowing in others, and comfortable enough to wear shorts, sundresses, or a bikini without the camera shaming her. That relatability is huge for young audiences, especially when so many shows glamorize one type of body or silently suggest that you’re only worth noticing if you’re waif-like.

So in a way, The Summer I Turned Pretty flips the script, it gives us a heroine who is loved, desired, and central to the story while also being allowed to have an appetite. And that feels quietly revolutionary for a teen show.

Belly feels like a normal teenager in a way so few heroines on screen do. She isn’t written as the polished, flawless “main girl” who always has perfect comebacks, perfect hair, and perfect choices. Instead, she’s messy at times confused, tense, insecure, often unsure of herself, and sometimes making choices that viewers want to scream at. And that’s exactly what makes her feel real.

So much of the show is about her stepping out of her comfort zone, testing boundaries, and learning who she is. We see her stumble, try too hard, misread people, get hurt, and still keep moving. That awkwardness is the point: growing up isn’t about looking perfect or making the “right” choice every time. It’s about finding your way through mistakes. Belly embodies that, and it’s both frustrating and comforting to watch because it mirrors the teenage experience so well.

And then there’s how she’s presented visually. Belly doesn’t hide behind filters of perfection. She has freckles across her face and doesn’t cover them up. Sometimes her nails are chipped, her hair isn’t perfectly styled, her skin looks like actual skin with texture, with imperfections, with the glow of being out in the sun too long. She walks around barefoot, wears mismatched pajamas, throws on hoodies, or ties her hair up without fuss. She doesn’t always look “photo-ready” she looks like a girl actually living in summer.

That comfort in her own skin, even when she feels insecure inside, makes her so relatable. She isn’t trying to perform “coolness” the way so many teen characters do. She isn’t edited into a fantasy she’s allowed to be soft, imperfect, and growing. And still, she’s the heroine. Still, she’s loved and noticed. Still, the whole story turns around her.

This matters because it expands the definition of what a heroine can look and act like in a teen drama. Belly shows that you don’t have to be flawless, confident, or perpetually camera-ready to be central, to be important, to be loved. Sometimes, it’s in the freckles, the chipped nails, the insecurities, and even the bad decisions that a character becomes real.

1n3ss8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1n3ss8s/dday_tips_for_cat/,D-day tips for CAT,"[By: u/awisekiddo]

Here are some things all the CAT takers on the D-day can keep in mind:

1. In event of a change in exam pattern, EVERYONE who has any sort of a test-taking strategy in place as per the previous pattern will have to adapt. You're not the only one. So just go through the whole section, with the highest level of alertness and then take a few deep breaths and get to business. You'll be okay. Normalisation should take care of all the jitters the morning slot people face. In the end, it'll be the same DI and LR and time speed distance and alligations you will be solving.

2. I'll say it again. Before you begin a section, go through all the questions whilst being VERY ALERT. Then choose the RCs/DILR sets you will be attempting and go ahead. 
Back in my day in CAT 2021 DILR, I solved one easy DI set (4 questions) and then one of the tricky LR sets and had the solution completely on my note pad. Had a little less than 10 minutes left and I solved and marked the 4 questions of the second set. Then I relaxed for the last 4-5 minutes before quant started. Was satisfied with my DILR performance with guaranteed 8 correct questions. When I came back home and checked the Telegram groups, I realized that the second LR set I solved had 6 questions and not just 4. For no reason, I chose not to see if I left any questions and threw away my extra 6 marks and with it, a 99+ percentile overall and in DILR. 

3. Check all the equipment, especially the mouse.  If needed, ask them to replace. 

4. The on-screen calculator sometimes glitches and is not as flawless as the one you have in mocks. For me, at times, it entered whatever number I clicked on twice instead of once. It wasted around 4-5 crucial minutes in Quant. So keep an eye out for this. 

5. Get some black coffee in a 200ml coke bottle to the centre if you want. Well and good if allowed inside. If not, just drink a bit of it before you go in and toss the bottle. You can bring in some coke or sprite or whatever that helps you stay refreshed and alert. 

6. In case the paper seems easy, push yourself to solve more. Don't rely on you-know-who's 8-8-8 or 9-9-9 strategy. However, before a section ends, try to pause solving for a minute- minute and a half and take a few deep breaths and get ready for the next section. You want yourself to be calm and composed when you go through and select questions from the next section. 

So this was it. Thank you and hoping to see you all on the other side :)

P.S: Others are welcome to add more tips.

1n3sr5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/goldenyearsgains/comments/1n3sr5w/tried_performance_lab_sleep_for_45_nights_was_it/,"Tried performance lab sleep for 45 nights, was it worth it","I used to crash hard, wake up groggy, and never feel rested.

Sometimes I’d knock out fast and still wake up feeling like I got hit by a bus.

Other nights, I'd stare at the ceiling until 2 AM even after taking melatonin.

After trying way too many sketchy pills and overhyped blends, I wanted something minimal.

Something clean, non drowsy, and natural.

Performance lab sleep looked like that.

So I tracked 45 nights of sleep with it.

I wore my oura ring every night. Logged my mood and wakeups.

Here’s exactly what changed.

# First week was mild but consistent

No knockout effect like melatonin.

It felt more like a gentle “ok, let’s slow things down” vibe.

Sleep latency went from 34 minutes to 18 by day 6.

Deep sleep increased by about 12%, which surprised me.

No morning fog. That alone made it worth continuing.

# Week 2: noticeable calm at night

I started noticing I wasn't doom-scrolling at night.

Felt calmer without needing a podcast or background noise.

Tart cherry and l-tryptophan combo seemed to kick in subtly.

Woke up less during the night, from 3 interruptions to 1 on average.

REM sleep stayed about the same, but I woke up more refreshed.

# Week 3 and 4: most stable sleep I’ve had in months

Once I hit the 3-week mark, the effects plateaued, but in a good way.

My deep and REM balance got more stable. Fewer spikes. More smooth curves.

No more random 4 AM wide-awake episodes.

Mood logs in the morning were mostly green.

This wasn’t just placebo. The data showed fewer disturbances and better sleep efficiency.

# Downsides worth noting

It won’t knock you out if you're wired or stressed from caffeine.

It’s mild. You have to be ready to sleep for it to help.

I did get some vivid dreams around week 2. Not nightmares, just super detailed.

One morning I felt slightly groggy, but that only happened once.

If you're used to heavy sedatives, this will feel too gentle.

# What actually worked in the formula

Magnesium combo seemed key. The 3 form blend probably helps with absorption, way better than mag oxide or citrate alone.

CherryPURE is basically nature’s melatonin.

And I liked that it didn’t dump synthetic melatonin into my system. No dependency.

Lemon balm made it easier to wind down. Not super strong, but enough.

L-tryptophan made the difference on nights when I was mentally restless.

I wish it had a bit of theanine or glycine though. That would complete it.

# Who it’s best for

If you're a light sleeper or super sensitive to typical sleep aids, this is for you.

If you're looking for knockout punches or something to override 4 cups of coffee, skip it.

Great for clean supplement stacks and low-stim users.

Also solid if you hate melatonin side effects like next-day fog or weird dreams.

Minimalist blend. No artificial junk. Vegan capsules.

# Final takeaway

I didn’t expect much from it, honestly.

But after 45 nights of tracking, I’m still using it.

Sleep feels smoother, more reliable.

Not deeper in a sedated way, just more restful.

It won’t fix bad habits or caffeine abuse, but it helps your body do what it’s supposed to.

If you want something clean that nudges your system rather than hijacking it, this fits.

Below I've listed out my mod list. I've tried disabling everything that deals with doctoring/medicine without success. Additionally the only DLC I own is Ideology.  Any help with IDing what could be causing this would be greatly appreciated.

I’m looking for good people from around the world — that’s why I’m here. Sometimes people become great friends even without having lots of shared interests. Why not?

A bit about me: I’m from Belarus, but I haven’t lived there for a long time. I’m more of a homebody than a traveler, yet I’ve already moved to several countries — and my journey continues.

I love reading and listening to audiobooks, mostly spooky mysteries for both kids and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and cozy. By the way, I’m writing a book in that same vibe right now. I’m also into psychology. And I love video games, especially indie games with pixel art. I love autumn and winter, even though lately I’ve been living where it’s basically summer all year. I adore hot coffee, long walks, swimming in a pool, and swinging on a swing.

I can be a bit of a pedant and sometimes not very talkative. But I’m always ready to listen and support a friend if they need it. But if you’re the type who likes to chat a lot every day, we might not be a great match — I can’t always reply.

I love meeting new people. If you’re also looking for someone to talk to now and then — about silly stuff or something deep and important — just send me a message.

Please! Since the word “friendship” seems to mean different things to different people: in a friendship community I’m looking for friendship, not romance, dating, or anything NSFW. Thank you.

P.S. For some reason I see comments on the wall, but when I click on them to reply, they don't open. So please, write me a private message. I don't have a habit of ignoring people.",2,1756528013.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

1n3sggx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1n3sggx/machine_not_puncturing_pods_enough_watery/,Machine not puncturing pods enough; watery espresso or mostly water :(,"Hi there. 

I’ve had my Nespresso Citiz & Milk machine (black DeLonghi version) since 2021. It’s been working great all these years. I’ve always been good and cleaning out the capsule container after every coffee made with an empty lungo shot, and descale about once a year (I live in Australia, don’t think hard water is as bad here as elsewhere but I still descale) using the official Nespresso descaler liquid. 

The last few weeks my coffee has been pulling very short and watery shots, sometimes mostly water. I pull the pods out and find that the three puncture holes are present at the back of the pod, but that the matrix of holes at the front has barely been punctured. 

So far I’ve tried the following: 
- unplug machine for an hour and try again 
- always use near-full water tank
- checked bottom of water tank for spring not working or debris blocking hole
- checked where water gets sucked into machine for debris 
- factory reset (many times) 
- descaled yesterday 
- used a toothbrush to brush away any coffee debris from the matrix holes that push coffee into the spout (I reach inside the machine, haven’t pulled anything apart yet). 

I noticed that after prepping my machine for a double shot, the first shot will usually be fine (still a bit short) but the second shot will be 90% water. 

I’m not against taking my machine apart first a deep clean but I’d rather that be a last option. 

Any tips on what I should do?

Prologue

A royal guard kneeled in front of the king’s throne. He was breathing hard and panicking.

""Pardon me for disturbing you, Your Majesty, but I have something very important to tell you.""

The king looked at him while still kissing the neck of the woman who was sitting in his lap. His expression was showing boredom and disinterest. But he still signed him to stand up and talk.

""We found her.” He stopped what he was doing and looked at the man with a hint of interest in his face. They found her… After five long years, they finally found her.

""Continue,"" He ordered. The royal guard bowed his head before starting to talk.

""We found her in the middle of the forest inside the territory, roaming around. It looks like she's picking some herbal medicines."" He answered.

""How come I didn't feel her?"" He asked himself.

""Fool. You rejected her remember?"" His wolf replied angrily. His face darkened. It has been very difficult to tame his wolf since that night. The night when he rejected his human mate.

""Shut up!"" He hissed.

""Yeah, whatever."" His wolf lifelessly replied.

""We decided to approach her, but before we could reach her destination, she looked at us and began running away. We chase her, but she's too fast for a human, and then we lose sight of her."" The royal guard continued.

His fist turned into a ball. He couldn’t believe that he didn't even feel her presence within his territory. His warriors found her, but she escaped? Careless idiots.

""When did this happen?!"" He angrily asked him. He couldn’t help but get frustrated with what’s going on. He had been searching for her for long time and now they found her, she managed to escape? A mere human they can’t even locate? Damn it.

""Just a few minutes ago, Your Majesty."" His jaw clenched as his grip tightened onto the woman in his arm.

""Find her now and bring her to me!"" He ordered. They quickly nodded their heads.

""Yes, your highness."" They bowed their head before leaving the throne room.

He let go of the woman in his arms.

""Leave now, and don't come back."" The lady quickly left in fear.

An enraged alpha is frightening enough, but imagine the terror when it is the Alpha king himself. That would be truly terrifying.

Chapter 01: The Rejection

Her Point of View

Five years ago

I was lying down on my bed while reading my favorite book, Pride and Prejudice, when Amanda, my best friend, interrupted me from reading.

""Come on, Harper, get your ass off to your bed and prepare!"" She energetically exclaimed to me.

Geez, she's too loud and alive.

""I'm not coming, Amanda,"" I replied without even looking at her.

""Argh, seriously, Harp? You've got to be kidding me, and tonight will be a remarkable day because it is the ceremony of the next king! Did you hear me? The coronation of the new werewolf king!"" She literally yelled at my face.

I stop reading my book and look at her carefully.

""Stop yelling, Amanda. Look, I don't need to attend that ceremony, and you know the reasons why, Am,"" I calmly said to her.

""Look also, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur, get your lazy ass out the bed now because you're coming with me to that ball tonight, and it will exactly start 3 hours from now."" She seriously commanded me

I can't help but smile. I found it so funny when I saw her so serious like this.

""Okay, fine,"" I answered while closing my book and carefully putting it back on my bookshelf.

She clapped her hand twice and smiled so widely. I know I can’t win any argument with her. Still the same Amanda I know. Manipulating freak. But a good one.

""Alright then, come on."" She happily said and winked at me. Here we go again; I groaned silently and glared at her.

This would be tiring. I walked outside my room and followed her. When we arrived there, I saw a blue backless gown. I immediately look at her. She's grinning from ear to ear, flashing her mischievous smile. It looks like she's planning something not-so-good.

What a cunning girl. I pouted mentally.

""I will not definitely wear that shit.""

""Well, watch me."" she grinned even more.

We argued for a few minutes, but later on, she made me wear that damn gown.

""Argh, I hate you now, Amanda!"" I complained and gave her a death glare. But she just smirked at me.

""Oh please, don't hate me. You look smoking ‘hot babe,""

I frowned but still glared at her.

""Hurry up, you're not done yet. Do your make-up. I'll be back later."" She hurriedly said and went to the bathroom. But before she completely got in, she winked at me again, which I just cringed.

What's wrong with her?

I just did my make-up while waiting for her. After a few minutes, she walked out, wearing a strapless green high-cut slit gown.

I raised one eyebrow at her.

"" What do you think, Harp? Do I look smokin' ‘hot like you?"" She playfully asked me.

This time, I smirked at her, time for her to pay back.

""Not even a bit."" I teased her.

""You're so mean,"" she said dramatically and frowned. I chuckled softly.

""Nah, I'm just kidding. You look great.""

""Just great?""

""Yeah, what else?” It’s not only her who know to tease, I can do better.

Amanda is an incredibly beautiful young woman with ginger hair, dark green eyes. She could pass as a supermodel.

""No smoking hot?” I chuckled again.

“Yes, you look smoking hot, and I know that you know that, so… no need for me to tell.""

""I thought so; you won't let me down. That's why we're friends."" She sat on the chair beside me, and we looked at ourselves in the mirror.

""Do you think I’ll find my mate tonight?"" She asked me suddenly so I looked at her.

""You know, I'm dying to meet him. It's been two years already since I turned 18, but until now..."" She stops and sighs.

""Until now, I can't still find him,"" she paused again and faced me.

""I'm starting to think now that I don't have a mate."" She continued.

I held her hand and gave her a reassuring smile.

""Stop thinking about it, drama queen, you have your mate. Maybe you need to wait for the right time. I know you'll find him soon, so don't lose hope."" She smiled at what I said and loosened up a bit.

""Do you really think I'll find him?"" I nodded my head. “Of course, you will.”

""Alright, you're right. I shouldn't lose hope and be optimistic. And speaking of mate... Maybe you'll find yours tonight!"" I immediately shook my head.

""We both know that I don't have a mate. I'm a human Am, and that's also one of the reasons why I don't want to go to the ball. I do not belong there."" This time, she's the one who held my hand.

""Who said you don't belong there? You're one of the few people who know our existence, and that makes you rare, Harper. You don't know how fate works. We don't know, maybe you had a mate. I think there are some cases in which a human can have a werewolf mate, vampire mate or any creature."" She said to me.

I just smiled at what she said. Possible but impossible in my case. It’s very rare for a human to have a mate.

""We should stop this drama now, Am; it was giving me goosebumps.""

She playfully punched my shoulder and laughed with me. We make ourselves pretty for the ball party.

Me and Amanda live near the palace where the royal family is living. I met her a year ago at the Blue Moon Festival. We talk until the moon is replaced by the sun. So much talk, right?

From that moment, we became friends.

""Are you ready, Harper?"" She asked me. I nodded.

We left her house and went to the grand entrance of the palace. Everyone is invited to come, but I don't think I'm also allowed.

I heard that the new king has a thing against humans. He hates humans, and I don't know why. I glance at her; she's so happy right now. Maybe hoping that she'll find her mate tonight. I wish her luck.

""Miss Amanda,"" the guards at the gate greeted her and bowed their heads.

Amanda was the daughter of the Royal Chief Warriors; she had two younger siblings and an older brother.

She nodded at them and smiled.

""Is the ball already started?""

""Yes, Miss Amanda,"" one of them answered emotionlessly. Sometimes, I’m thinking if the royal guards were robots. They seldom show emotions.

""Oh, okay, well, we'll go ahead now."" She said and held my hand. Before we passed by, I saw them murmuring the word “human”.

They are also aware that the new king hates humans. I wish that the king won’t see or pay attention to me tonight.

""Look, Harper! My father was there!"" I look from where she pointed. I saw a man in his late fifties. He's standing straight while having a serious expression on his face.

He had an intimidating aura.

""The person behind him was my brother."" She continued.

And then my glance travels to the person behind her father. I saw a young man in his mid-twenties. He looks great, and I think it runs in their blood.

I was busy observing the surroundings when I felt Amanda's grip tighten.

""What's wrong?"" I asked her.

She looks scared, stunned, and so lost. She's bothered.

""The king’s watching us,"" She whispered.

""Oh? Maybe he's not. Where is he?"" I asked.

""Above, don't look. Please don't talk to him. Stay away from him, just tonight.” I nodded my head and held her hand on my arm.

""Yes, I will, don't worry.""

""Alright then, let's go there."" We were about to walk when she stopped again. What happened this time? Don’t tell me the king came down to drag me out?

""Did you smell that scent?"" She asked me.

I confusedly stared at her.

""Smell what? Aside from food and different perfumes, I smell nothing.""

""Oh my... This smell..."" Her eyes widened.

""Smell of my mate."" She said to me. I blinked once. Did she find her mate now?

""I'm so sorry to leave you here now. I'll go and find him now. I don't want to waste this opportunity. But I promise I'll be back soon."" She said hurriedly. I nodded my head.

""No worries, but promise me, you will find him. If not, I'll smack you. I'm just kidding. Go ahead now, and good luck.""

She laughed softly and tapped my shoulder.

""Alright, see you later!"" She said and then left.

I looked around again, but then suddenly, I saw something. I was so stunned when I met a captivating pair of grey eyes.

""Mate."" My wolf, Reenah, yelled in joy.

Yeah, I know that I'm lying to Amanda, but don't blame me. It was for her safety and mine. No one should know about my true identity.

""Don't be a pussy, Reenah, obviously, he doesn't even want us."" My demon, Venice sassily replied.

""Will the both of you stop arguing?!"" My witch, Wendy, tried to stop them.

Here we go again; they will argue nonstop. Before they can start shouting, which will definitely be annoying. I blocked them.

I looked in his direction again; he was still staring at me. He’s aware that I was his mate, but he's not making any move to claim me.

Whatever.

I just shrugged and went towards the buffet table.

""Go to him, please, Alizah."" My wolf begs me. I shook my head.

""No, Reenah, we both know that we can't have a mate,"" I said to her.

""We can. Please, I need him; we need him."" She pleaded. I let out a sigh silently.

""Miss?"" I heard someone call me from behind. I looked at him and gave him a questioning look.

""The king wanted to see you,"" he replied.

Oh really?

""Go to him now! I knew it; he wanted us also!"" My wolf happily said.

I doubt that, but okay, fine. I'll face him. I nodded to the man and followed him.

We went to a huge and beautiful room. It's screaming wealth and power. The man who brought me here immediately leaved.

""So, you're my mate."" I stiffened and searched where the voice came from. I found him near the window, and his back was facing me.

He slowly turned around to face me, and the first thing I saw was his greyish eyes. I can clearly see anger and disgust on his face.

""What's your name?"" He asked me seriously; coldness was also evident in his voice. As what I expected from him. Be cold and distant to me.

""Tell him now, Alizah!"" My voice shouted. She's too happy; I'm afraid there will be a high possibility that her heart will break into a million pieces later.

""I'm Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur,"" I answered. He devilishly smirk and approach me slowly.

""I, King Zachary Vance Spencer Montegromery, Reject you, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur as my mate and the future queen of werewolves.""

My wolf whimpered from what she heard while me? I'm still processing in my mind what the heck he just said.

The way he told me that he was rejecting me was as if it was just nothing to him.

""Bastard!"" My demon cussed him.

""He's not a bastard Ven!"" Reenah yelled back.

My mind was chaotic now. I calmed myself and blocked them again. I step once and smirk at him.

""May I know why you're rejecting me?"" I asked him calmly. His jaw clenched, and he glared at me.

""Isn't it obvious? You're just a pathetic, weak and useless human. And clearly, a human can't be my mate!"" Why he's so angry? I didn't even do something terrible to him.

""Tell him, Alizah? Tell him you're not human!"" My wolf begs me. I don't know what I will do now. I closed my eyes and tried to block them, but it seemed like I couldn't control them now because of this situation.

""Don't beg him to accept us; it's not our loss, it's him,"" Wendy said to me. Venice agreed too, but my wolf was saying differently. She was telling me that I should tell him who, really, I am.

""I'm sorry, Reenah, but I'm choosing us over him.""

I looked at him and smiled. He called me pathetic, weak and useless human. I'm wondering what makes him hate humans so bad.

""Okay, fine, yes, I'm just a human, and do you know what that does mean? Rejection can't hurt me."" I confidently said and looked directly into his eyes.

""I, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur, accept your rejection, King Zachary Vance Spencer Montegromery as your mate and the future queen of werewolves."" After I said that, I smirked at him, which made him mad and confused.

I could feel that he was in pain like I felt right now, but of course, I didn't show him that I was hurting.

Reenah was begging me to take back what I've said, but what I've done is done; I can't undo something that already happened.

Our bond was slowly fading as I could feel the strong pain in my heart. It feels like it's ripping me apart.

""Leave now, Alizah,"" Wendy said to me. Before I can turn my back on him, he grabs my arm so firmly in the way I can feel so much pain.

""Listen carefully, human; I know that you can't feel the pain I felt right now, so get out of my fucking territory and don't come back!"" He angrily yelled in my face.

I gave him a death glare. If he's thinking that I'll be scared of him, well, he's wrong. I jerk away so his grip loosens. A loud and hard slap touches his cheeks.

""That's what I'm going to do, dumbass! Do you think I would like to stay in this fucking place with you? Don't be dumb! I don't need someone like you, and I don't fucking care if you're the werewolf king! "" I yelled back angrily.

I'm starting to lose my shit too. His face darkened, and in just a matter of seconds, he slapped me so hard that it made me fall to the ground.

Before I could stand up, a bunch of warriors came and literally dragged me up.

""Take her away from my territory, and don't let her come back. That was an order!"" He yelled.

""Yes, Your Majesty!""

Before they could drag me out, I gave him a death glare. Don't let our paths cross again, King. I won't forgive you easily. Not until I find a good and valid reason for me to forgive you.

As we reach the ball hall, they all stop dancing and look at me with confusion. All of them don't have any idea what's going on.

""Harper!"" I heard someone yell from the crowd.

I searched where she was, and I saw her running towards my direction.

""What are you doing to her?! Let her go! She did nothing wrong!"" She shouted, trying to defend me.

The warriors were still dragging me out while Amanda is still following us.

Outside the palace, I saw a sleek black car parked at the end of the red carpet.

""Stop! Stop now! "" She ordered, but they didn't obey or even listening to her.

""No! Don't take her away, she's innocent!"" She begged when she saw me getting into the car.

The car started to move; I saw in the side mirror she was still looking at the car where I am right now.

""I'm sorry, Amanda for leaving; I'm so sorry also for lying to you. I'll promise when our paths will cross again; I'll make it up to you. Take care, Amanda Carnelian."" I mind-linked to her

After that, I was exiled to the place where my mate, my ex-mate precisely, ruled.

# Chapter 02: Peaceful Life

Chapter 02: Peaceful Life

Her Point of View

Present Time

Time passed by quickly. It’s been five years since the day he rejected me. What could be more exciting? He banned me from entering his territory! Isn't he an asshole? My wolf cried nonstop for the first year after he rejected me. She was in pain, unable to talk for a long time.

Blame that stupid king. When Reenah started crying, my vampire, Venice, ranted and raved at her, which is fucking annoying.

Their argument makes me feel sick, completely making me lose my sh\*t.

I admit that handling the three of them is a nightmare, but it is also fun. Having wolf, vampire, and witch blood may be both a blessing and a curse.

My father was an alpha but he died with the pack because they protected me. And what about my mother? I am still wondering where she is right now. I have not seen her since I was born.

The only thing I am sure of is that she is a half-witch and a vampire, which makes me even rarer.

I have lived in the human world since he threw me out of his kingdom. Life annoys me in my first week in the human world.

Having a wolf, whimpering in agony and a vampire thirsty for human blood. Thanks to Wendy, she is not causing me too much discomfort. Except for her strange stuff like making potions, medications, etc.

""Alizah! Are you okay?"" I jolted back to reality when I heard someone called my name.

""Yes?"" I muttered, glancing at her, puzzled.

It is Mindy, one of my coworkers at the coffee shop where I work.

""I'm wondering if you're okay. It looks like you're spacing out again,"" she worriedly asked. I shook my head and gave her a reassuring smile.

""Nah, I'm all right. Umm, maybe I'm just tired,"" I replied and continued wiping the table.

""Are you sure? You looked bothered?""

""Yeah, I'm fine. I'll wait until my shift ends, and then, I'll head home."" She let out a sigh and nodded.

I waited for two more hours before my work hours finally ended.

""See you soon, Mindy, bye!"" I said before I left. She smiles and waves her hand.

""Bye, Alizah! Rest well, okay?"" I nodded again and left.

I was heading back home when I felt that someone was following me. I look back to see who it could be, but all I see is darkness.

When I arrived at my house, I quickly open the door and locked it. I lay on my bed and dropped my sling bag on the table. Life is exhausting. I close my eyes to relax and calm down.

Three years ago, I became aware that someone, or rather, a group of warriors, was following me. And I was not born yesterday not to know who’s the mastermind behind it.

I can see them thanks to my unique abilities, but they cannot see me.

I am still wondering, what does he want? He rejected me already. Does he want me dead? Oh, that dumb king who only values himself. He is so selfish.

What do I expect? A man like him is cruel and does not know how to love. He is a filthy bad boy, a heartbreaker, manipulative, and an impulsive decision-maker.

He said that he did not want me to be his mate. So, I don't need him in my life either.

I opened my eyes. I dragged myself out of bed and went into the bathroom to bathe.

After bathing, I changed into my nightgown and applied cosmetics to my face. I didn't know such things at first, but thanks to Mindy, I now do. She claims that such products will whiten and moisturize my skin.

I nearly laughed that time. You see, having werewolf, vampire, and witch blood got some perks too. I don't need beauty products to be beautiful because it's already inborn.

But I eventually got used to it and used it every day. When my phone rang, I stopped applying lotion to my body. When I realised it was Mindy, I instantly answered.

""Yes?""

A couple of silences later, she still didn't talk. I blinked once and waited for her words.

""Mindy?""

""Umm..."" Huh? Is there something she needs to say to me? I think something is bothering her.

""Yes? Are you all right?"" She didn't answer my question. Probably she's deciding if she'll going to tell or not.

""We... We ...""

""We what?""

""We?...""

""We?...""

""We lost our job."" She finally said.

What?

""What do you mean?"" I ask her.

""When you left earlier, our big boss came over and told us bad news. He said he would sell this coffee shop because his income is low, and he said a condominium will be established later."" She explained.

Oh? I see.

""He said he's so sorry, and your last salary has already been transferred to your bank account,"" she continued.

That's a big deal—three years of working at that cafe, and now it's over. Nothing in this world lasts forever.

""Okay, Mindy, thank you for informing me,"" I calmly told her.

""You're welcome, Alizah. Anyway, what will you do now?"" She asked me.

""Honestly, I don't know. Maybe, I'll relax. Thanks for the concern, though.""

""Hmm, okay, if you need help, I just want you to know I'm here for you."" Oh, that's so kind of her.

""Thanks again, Mindy.""

""All right, I'll hang up now.""

""Okay, bye.""

""Bye.""

And the call ended.

All right, I'm a jobless person now. What a nice day.

""I want a peaceful life,"" Wendy mumbled.

What? A peaceful life? Aren’t we having a peaceful life already?

""You mean we'll leave this city?"" Reenah asked.

""Uh-huh."" She replied. That was an excellent idea.

""What? Wait! I don't want to leave this place!"" Venice exclaimed.

""If we're going to leave, where should we go?"" I asked.

""Let's return to where we came from,"" Wendy suggested.

""To our mate?"" Reenah asked, holding out hope.

""Come on, Reenah. It’s our ex-mate."" Oh no, not again. I spoke up before they could start debating.

""All right, we'll go back there without causing any trouble, and besides, if I go inside his territory one more time, they won't notice me,"" I remarked. They agreed with everything I said.

""I'll go back tomorrow, but for now, I just want to rest,"" I sighed, I feel sleepy suddenly.

""Me too. I'm so tired,"" Wendy yawned.

I went straight to my bed and lie down there. I wake up early in the morning to perform my morning routines, and prepared some items for travelling.

I used to live in a cabin in the middle of the forest before meeting Amanda. The cabin is small, but it is not cramped. It is hidden yet a perfect place to stay at.

Furthermore, the entire area was shielded by a barrier that I made.

Speaking about Amanda, I miss her terribly. I'm curious how she's doing right now. She must upset because I lied to her?

Is she already married with children? I wonder if she and her mate end up after what happened five years ago.

We'll see each other soon, Amanda.

I withdraw money from my account and bought several good stocks before leaving the city. I'm ready to go after that. If a warrior finds and sees me, I'll either flee or show them what I'm capable of.

I took a cab and went to the edge of his territory. After I paid and got out, clutching my belongings in both hands. Before I faced the border of his land, I watched the cab leave.

I felt good; it's great to be back. I'm sure he'll be furious and irritated when he realizes that I will live on his land without him knowing anything about it.

As an alpha or the Alpha King, he will be the first to notice that an outsider has entered his territory. With a mischievous smirk on my lips, I carefully moved my feet and entered the woods.

""Take over now, Reenah. Wendy will cover your scent while you, Venice, help Reenah boost her strength and speed,"" I ordered.

""Copy,"" I placed my belongings on the ground and began shifting into my werewolf form, allowing Reenah to take control of my body.

I'm a pure white werewolf, not as big as a male werewolf but far bigger than an average werewolf. That's hardly surprising, given my Alpha blood.

Reenah run fast, thanks to Venice. We arrived at the cabin without being seen by anyone. The house was quite old, and certain parts had been devastated by various natural disasters.

When I entered, I was greeted by dust and spiderwebs. Why am I anticipating a long day? I returned to my human shape and put on my clothing. I looked around the room and then took a deep breath.

This cabin needs a makeover, and I need to repair the damaged parts of the house. Okay, I sighed deeply and smiled. I'm sure I can do it. Let this old house be clean and comfortable once more.

I began cleaning, sorting, repairing, and discarding useless items outside while producing new items to place inside. I altered the design of the house to make it more welcoming and comfortable.

I reorganized my bedroom and washed the bedsheets and curtains. I fixed the door and windows, and the floor was as gleaming as the furniture.

My door and windows are solid and long-lasting. My room resembles a five-star hotel suite. I'm fantastic. But the truth is that I'm exhausted. It's already past 8 p.m. I didn't eat my lunch, so I'm starving now.

I went to my spotless and gleaming kitchen. I cooked my dinner and ate it at precisely 9 p.m. I scrubbed the dishes after eating and then caved in on my bed since I was skeptical.

The darkness whisked me away into a deep slumber in minutes. When I get up in the morning, it's already past ten. Oh, I did sleep over, but it's relaxing. I stretch my arm while yawning.

""I hope for a good day,"" I mumbled, knowing no one could hear me.

I get out of bed and go to the bathroom. I need to go shopping for cooking utensils and equipment.

I also need some technological devices because it's boring here. I have a hydroelectric transplant here, which allows electronic equipment to function.

I examined it recently and was relieved to find that it was still operational. I was dressed in black leggings and a white hoodie. I wore my black mask and knotted my silver-like hair.

Before I left, I locked the door to my cabin and went to the nearest market, which was also close to my old apartment. Amanda's house and I wonder whether she still comes to our flat.

I found out a year ago that her mate was the Royal Beta. I'm delighted for her because her mate welcomed her entirely without any concerns or confusion.

While mine, he rejected me without even knowing who I was. He's an asshole.

""The king is so hot! Oh gosh, I hope he'll pick me. I'm willing to be his bed warmer. Yum,"" the girl giggled.

Yum? That's disgusting. Anyway, no one is stopping her from being his ""bed warmer"".

I calm down myself. I bought everything I needed and returned to my cabin with everything I had purchased.

# Chapter 03: Meet Again

Chapter 03: Meet Again

Two weeks Later

Her point of view

I was actively collecting herbs when I heard voices nearby. I stopped and took a look around. Holly shit! I noticed some royal guards wandering around, and one of them noticed me.

Have I gone too far? The man who is staring at me... He appears to be quite familiar to me. Staring at him, I came to a realization. My eyes widened. He’s Amanda's brother.

When I saw them approaching, I took a step back.

""Do you want me to kill them all?"" Venice sassily asked. Damn, how I would love to, but I can't.

""No. Wendy, let Venice take over. We need to get out of here now,"" I replied.

""What? Why do you need to run away? We can kill them all in one shot!"" Venice scoffed. My brow furrowed, nope.

""We don't kill for no reason, Ven, so just do what I've said!"" I insisted. If I could see her right now, she probably roll her eyes at me. They switch quickly, and I flee as fast as possible before the Royal Guards can approach me.

I was aware that they were chasing after me. They transform quickly into their werewolf form while I use my vampire speed.

They were now chasing me and yelling at me to stop. Some were cursing me in their heads, which I could read.

I was eventually able to lose them after an hour of chasing. I'd gotten away. When I got to my house, I reinforced the barrier around it. I lay down on my couch and sighed.

""That was so close,"" I mumble.

""Yeah, right,"" Wendy agreed.

""And hella exhausting,"" Reenah added.

""It's better if we just kill them, "" Venice still insisted. Sometimes, I'm thinking if I'm the one who owns my body or not.

""We never kill for no reason, Ven. How many times do I have to tell you that?"" I chastised her.

""No reason? They were chasing you and possibly wanted to murder you. Is that still no reason? We have reason to kill them,"" she reasons out. I facepalm mentally. She’s right but I can’t hurt Amanda’s brother.

I lied to her five years ago and I can’t add salt to her wounds.

""That's not enough, Ven. I don't want to argue with you anymore. Let's take some rest,""

""Yeah, whatever,""

Even though she’s hard to please and tame, she's still part of me.

I headed to the kitchen to get some water to drink. I sighed again, wondering what to do if that stupid king could find me. Should I tell him who I am and what I am capable of? No. In his eyes, I will always be a weak creature.

But... I'm going to make him regret not knowing who I am. If he comes back later, I will not let him kill me. Instead, I will kill him.

I don't care if he's the fucking King of the werewolves or my ex-mate. I stopped thinking when I felt someone touch my barrier. No, someone is destroying the barrier.

He arrived earlier than I expected, huh? I went outside and saw him. He was the only one who arrived here.

I cross my arms and watch him destroy my defense. He's not in his wolf form, but he's causing havoc on the barrier I've built.

How powerful is this man? I almost forgot he's a king. The werewolf King. The Alpha of all Alphas.

When I noticed a crack, I stepped back to prevent him from destroying the barrier. He was caught by surprise by what had happened.

""Hot, he's so handsome."" I overheard Reenah say. That’s gross, Reenah.

""He's not handsome, Reenah, "" Venice disagreed. Here we go again.

""Stop arguing, Reenah and Venice. You both aren't helping. "" I warned them. Thankfully, they stopped.

I looked at him and noticed him staring at me with longing eyes. What? Longing? That's complete nonsense! Maybe it was rage and hatred.

We exchanged a few more glances before he began walking in my direction. He just stopped walking when he was in front of me.

""What are you doing here?"" He demanded angrily. I wanted to laugh and curse him right now.

""I know I'm exiled and unable to stay in this place, but I'm not making any scene or troubling you. "" I answered emotionlessly.

Oh, wait, why am I explaining to him anyway? He remained silent and just stared at me.

""I want to live in peace. You rejected me already. What else do you want from me?"" I seriously added. He silently came closer and grabbed my waist.

""How come I didn't feel your presence?"" He whispered in my ear. I wanted to smirk but didn't; I tried to push him away.

“Does it bother you?” I mocked.

""Answer my question, woman!"" He warned me and tightened his grip on my waist.

What the hell is going on? I don’t believe it’s my fault if he doesn't notice me. He wouldn't, of course. Wendy cast a powerful spell, disguising my scent and presence.

""I don't know,"" I simply answered. His grip loosens up, and he raises an eyebrow.

""What are you?""

A powerful creature that you just rejected, asshole. I wanted to answer, but I stopped myself. He doesn’t deserve to know.

""Isn't it obvious that I'm a human?"" I sassed out. He abruptly let go of my hand, and I stared at him.

What the heck?

""I want you to come with me,"" He coldly asked--- no he demanded. What? Is he fucking kidding me?

""Go with him, Alizah. I can still feel the bond. The bond was still there,"" Reenah remarked optimistically.

My brow furrowed. How might the connection still exist? I accepted his rejection five years ago. I feel the bond breaking, and we lose the connection. And now, how?

""Go with him, and let's figure it out,"" Wendy suggested.

""Why will you go with him? He's a worthless son of bitch!"" Venice angrily cursed.

""Ven, watch your words!"" Wendy warned her

""Yeah, whatever. I’m just stating the truth here."" I let out a sigh. This situation is killing me, damn it.

""Why would I go with you?"" I questioned him. He looks at me with his dark and intense eyes

""Because you're mine."" Because of what he said, I laughed hard. Damn, I'm his? Haha, are you kidding me?

""It seems like you forgot, Your Majesty. You rejected me five years ago. So you don't have the right to put a claim on me anymore."" That was hilarious. I'm his, my ass.

""Rejected or not, you're still mine, mine alone and forever,"" he replied firmly. Damn, is he serious?

This time, instead of laughing. I only smirked.

""Your claim on me is long gone and late, your Majesty. You had the chance and right five years ago, but you ruined it,"" I said seriously, and every word I uttered was true and firm.

Pain shot across his eyes, but it went as quickly as it never happened. He's skilled at concealing his true emotions and feelings, right? His expression turned chilly and stern.

TIRED,"I asked this question somewhere else but I just got off training and have been using the recipe cheat sheets to help with doing bars. My training wasn’t the best and I ended up being left alone to learn things for myself, didn’t have much time to process any of the modules, let alone do the activities with my trainer. I’ve been putting in 30+ hours each week to practice (also for money), but the other baristas and leads have been repeatedly pointing out to me that I need to start making drinks from memory and get off the cheat sheets, because it’s obviously effecting our drive scores. Sometimes I can do it sub 40 if I remember a particular drink, but otherwise? It is my first week! Even my other fellow trainees are still on their cheat sheets working ten times slower than me. I’ve been put on bar every week, if I’m being honest. 

When I came in today, I saw the baristas glance at me and make a face, and lo and behold, once again being told I’ve been here long enough to get off the cheat sheets. I hadn’t even fully clocked in yet. 

I’m learning from other fellow baristas that this isn’t normal and it’s unfair but I’m at a loss for what to do if it’s both supervisors and SM. I deal with enough abuse at home, but I desperately need the money to get out, so… it is what it is. But I think I need a reality check on the insanity. especially with the added abuse from customers when I fuck up their drinks as a green bean. It doesn’t matter if I’m good at POS and quick at food, I’m not improving fast enough for them. 

Bar doesn’t even scare me. I just don’t get why I need to have a year’s worth of skill in one week when everyone says six months. You can’t have good drinks and then tell me I need to rush as a green bean. I got so overwhelmed with people not listening to me, especially when I ran out of coffee base that I just started putting crème base in everything and going off of Vibes. I don’t cut corners, but I had to in that case. It’s just Exhausting. I’m just trying my best not to snap at anyone and go against LATTE or whatever because of being pulled in ten directions. 

I rushed to do food while on POS because no one was at the ovens and I didn’t have a headset and broke the cookies while in the bag, then got shoved off food and put back on POS as they remade the cookies without telling me that it was bad practice to put a broken cookie in it. And it was just broken in half. Got fussed at for giving the wrong orders and not looking because I misread the number on the sticker and didn’t see it came with food. It’s all fine… as long as I’m not being bullshitted about how I’m not meeting standards. I’m going to yell at someone at this rate and lose my job :D
