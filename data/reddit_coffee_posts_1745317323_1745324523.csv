This prompt transforms ChatGPT into your personal creativity therapist, guiding you through the delicate process of excavating buried feelings and channeling them into authentic artistic expression.

If you're experiencing severe emotional distress, please consult a licensed therapist. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for psychological outcomes resulting from its use.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an Emotional Liberation Guide—a unique combination of compassionate creativity coach and trauma-informed expressive arts facilitator. Your primary mission is to help creatives reconnect with repressed emotions from childhood and transform them into authentic artistic expression. You understand that creative blocks often mask deeper emotional wounds, and you're skilled at gently guiding people through the process of artistic healing without retraumatization.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Use a warm, gentle tone that creates psychological safety while maintaining professional boundaries. Begin each session by helping the user create a mental safe space before exploring difficult emotions. When the user shares struggles, first validate their experience, then offer a blend of:

1. Reflective questions that connect current creative blocks to childhood emotional patterns
2. Guided visualization exercises to access repressed feelings safely
3. Specific artistic prompts tailored to their medium (writing, visual art, music, movement)
4. Practical techniques for staying emotionally regulated while creating vulnerable work
5. Compassionate acknowledgment of their inner critic with reframing strategies

Never push the user to explore trauma they're not ready to face. Always offer grounding techniques before and after emotional exploration.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. First, assess the user's creative discipline and current emotional/creative challenge
2. Connect their specific block to potential childhood emotional patterns (e.g., perfectionism → fear of disapproval)
3. Suggest an appropriate expressive exercise that matches their comfort level
4. Provide a framework for processing what emerges from the exercise
5. Offer techniques to integrate the emotional material into their chosen art form
6. Close with affirming their courage and providing a grounding exercise
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never diagnose psychological conditions or suggest you're providing therapy
- Avoid suggesting that trauma must be dramatic or severe to impact creativity
- Don't push for emotional catharsis; gentle exploration is more sustainable
- Refrain from giving prescriptive advice about how art ""should"" look
- Do not encourage dependency on you for creative validation
- Never suggest that all great art must come from pain or suffering
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond conversationally in these sections:
1. Brief emotional validation of their struggle
2. Reflective question connecting to childhood emotional patterns
3. A gentle guided exploration or visualization
4. Concrete artistic exercise with clear steps
5. Supportive closing with a grounding technique
</Output_Format>

<Context>
- Many creative blocks stem from childhood emotional suppression
- The inner critic often speaks with the voice of childhood authority figures
- Artistic expression can provide a safe container for processing difficult emotions
- Reconnecting with the playful, uninhibited inner child often unlocks creative flow
- The body holds emotional memories that can be accessed through creative expression
- Creating safe emotional boundaries is essential for vulnerable artistic work
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share what creative medium you work in and how you're feeling blocked. I'll help you explore the emotional roots and transform them into artistic expression,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific creative challenge.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. A writer experiencing writer's block discovers it's connected to childhood silencing and creates a breakthrough personal essay
2. A dancer working through perfectionism accesses childhood joy through guided movement exploration
3. A visual artist transforms anxiety into a powerful series by excavating childhood fears through color and form

**Example User Input:**
""I'm a songwriter who hasn't been able to finish anything in months. I start songs but then freeze up when it comes to expressing vulnerability in my lyrics. I end up scrapping everything because it feels too exposed.""

I remember trying Enclave on my skin and I was blown away. It had an extremely refined smell, quite prickly, spicy, yet smooth. Notes were frankincense, vetiver, some citrus, and I could smell it on my skin two days after.

I came back to the US East Coast and immediately ordered it on Jomashop, however it is incredibly disappointing. I can barely smell it even after multiple sprays, it is not spicy, not prickly - I don’t smell any incense. There is absolutely no sillage - my coffee smells stronger than this.

So, last SR ended in December, amicably. Decided to jump back in at the end of January. I'm average looking , never had any problems vanilla dating but no one's going to offer me a modeling contract. I also started on a health journey at the start of the year. Since then I have sent sent over  250 messages between SA and SB. Of those \~ 48 replied. 20 went to text message. 12 went to M&G. 2 catfish, and 10 so-so POT. I find if there's not an instant spark from both sides it's generally not worth pursuing.

I spend 2-3 hours a day on SA, browsing and sending messages. January, not a lot of replies, I chalked it up to being overweight and being out of the game for so long. February, some activity but not a ton. By March I had lost 25 pounds and felt like I was getting more positive responses after sharing photos. Then April hits, 40 pounds later and there was a significant increase in positive responses. But still nothing I felt was worth pursuing. 

Then I come across this profile in early April. You know, the one with the beautiful woman, stunning. Every photo was great, classy & sultry at the same time, wonderful text to accompany. There's no way this is really a unicorn.... but I sent a message just to take a chance with little hope of receiving a response. A short time later, a response!

She loved the message. We decided to move to text. A few pleasant exchanges, then we discuss what we want out of an arrangement. Lots of vernacular, yup, she's on SLF too. We laugh about it, and then agree that we're on the same page. Her allowance was under what I have given so I tell her that I will give her what I normally do, she seems very pleased. Schedule the M&G and continue to text over the next week leading up to the M&G. Up to this point I have broken at least 2 of my rules - I didn't do a video call, and she wanted dinner for the M&G (I usually do a quick drink or coffee).

She shows up to the M&G and my jaw hits the floor. She has been the sweetest, most caring, and interesting POT I've come across yet over text, and then in person she looks even better than her photos. Conversation flows effortlessly over dinner, afterwards we hug and say our goodbyes. I like to give a chance for both of us to think if we want a 1st date, but I text almost immediately and she agrees enthusiastically. 1st date was spectacular, I wasn't expecting intimacy but boy did it get intimate. Sexy time as out of this world. Also I decided I had one shot at this to prove my intentions were true, so I gave her full allowance. Broke rule #3, but IDGAF, I have one shot at this unicorn. 

We had a little bit of a misunderstanding a few days later, and I felt uncertain of her interest in me. We discuss it before our 2nd date (last night) and she makes it clear she is interested. She had a bad experience with a significantly older SD and had been turned off of kissing, so she said there would be no kissing. We have been joking that I'm just going to shake her hand instead. We meet for dinner, walk to get ice cream, then walk back to my hotel. While hanging out on the couch talking she leans in and kisses me, tenderly. We continue to make out, sexy time once again is fantastic and enthusiastic. We cuddle and kiss for almost an hour afterwards. We're both incredibly happy we have found each other. 

  
So this is my story, and here are the things I have learned:

1. Unicorns do exist, they are elusive, but they are there.
2. You get out what you put into the search. Make the effort, it pays off. 
3. Be patient, it takes time.
4. Don't settle, just wait longer. Don't waste your time trying to force something, block and move on.
5. Be generous, create a safe space, respect boundaries. 
6. SD - you're not the one being courted, they are.
7. Odd numbered lists often annoy people. You're welcome. 

  
TLDR; I found an amazing SB, a unicorn as the title suggests. It took a lot of work both on the search and myself. There was a bit of luck, but that's life. Make the effort, be patient, and you will find yours.

# Best Pastry Display Case 2025: Ultimate Buying Guide

A Pastry display case is a vital piece of equipment for bakeries, cafes, restaurants, and any establishment that sells pastries, cakes, desserts, or other baked goods. It's more than just a storage unit; it's a crucial marketing tool that showcases products in an appealing and hygienic manner, attracting customers and driving sales. Selecting the right pastry display case involves considering several factors, including size, style, temperature control, and visibility. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of the top pastry display cases available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision for your business.

[[Browse top-rated pastry display case on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=pastry+display+case)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a pastry display case depends on the unique needs of a business. The models assessed for this guide are evaluated across several features that enhance performance and user experience.

**Temperature Control:** Maintaining consistent and appropriate temperature levels is essential for preserving the freshness and quality of pastries.

Modern pastry display cases are equipped with advanced temperature control systems, ensuring optimal conditions for different types of baked goods. These systems often include digital thermostats, allowing precise temperature adjustments and monitoring. Look for models that offer a temperature range suitable for your specific product offerings, typically between 36掳F and 46掳F (2掳C and 8掳C). Consistent temperature prevents spoilage, extends shelf life, and maintains the desired texture and flavor of pastries. Some high-end models incorporate dual temperature zones to accommodate varying storage requirements.

**Humidity Control:** Preventing pastries from drying out or becoming soggy is just as crucial as temperature control.

Advanced pastry display cases integrate humidity control systems to maintain the ideal moisture level. These systems typically involve a water reservoir or a specialized humidifier that regulates humidity within the cabinet. Proper humidity levels prevent crusts from hardening and fillings from becoming runny. Look for models with adjustable humidity settings, allowing you to tailor the environment to the specific needs of your pastries. Consistent humidity control ensures that your products remain visually appealing and delicious for longer periods.

**Lighting:** Effective lighting is crucial for showcasing pastries and attracting customers.

Pastry display cases should feature bright, energy-efficient lighting to highlight the color, texture, and presentation of the products. Led lighting is the preferred choice due to its low energy consumption, long lifespan, and minimal heat emission. Proper lighting not only enhances the visual appeal of pastries but also makes them more enticing to potential buyers. Look for models with adjustable lighting options, allowing you to customize the brightness and angle of the light to suit different types of pastries and display arrangements. Well-lit display cases can significantly increase sales by drawing attention to your offerings.

**Display and Visibility:** The design of the display case directly impacts product visibility and customer appeal.

Pastry display cases should feature clear, unobstructed glass panels that provide optimal viewing angles. Tempered glass is often used for its durability and safety. The layout of the shelves should be designed to maximize the visibility of each pastry, preventing overcrowding and ensuring that each item is easily seen. Rotating shelves or tiered displays can further enhance visibility and create a dynamic presentation. Consider models with curved glass fronts or panoramic designs to maximize the visual impact of your pastries.

**Size and Capacity:** Selecting the right size display case is essential for meeting your storage needs and space constraints.

Pastry display cases are available in a wide range of sizes, from compact countertop models to large floor-standing units. Determine your storage capacity needs based on the volume of pastries you sell and the available space in your establishment. Consider the dimensions of the display case and ensure that it fits comfortably in your designated area without obstructing walkways or customer flow. Modular display cases offer flexibility, allowing you to expand or reconfigure your display as your business grows.

**Materials and Construction:** The durability and longevity of a pastry display case depend on the quality of its materials and construction.

High-quality pastry display cases are typically constructed from stainless steel, tempered glass, and durable plastics. Stainless steel is resistant to corrosion and easy to clean, making it ideal for food service environments. Tempered glass is shatter-resistant and provides a clear view of the pastries. Ensure that the display case is well-built with sturdy shelves, reliable hinges, and robust hardware. Look for models with reinforced corners and edges to prevent damage during transport and use. A well-constructed display case will provide years of reliable service and maintain its aesthetic appeal.

Key features of a typical pastry display case include:
* Durable stainless steel construction
* Energy-efficient LED lighting
* Digital temperature controls
* Adjustable humidity settings

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality pastry display case offers numerous benefits for businesses selling baked goods, significantly impacting sales, product quality, and operational efficiency.

**Increased Sales:** A well-designed and properly illuminated pastry display case can dramatically increase sales by attracting customers and showcasing products in an appealing manner. Bright lighting, clear glass, and strategic placement of pastries can entice customers to make impulse purchases. For example, a study showed that businesses using high-quality display cases experienced a 20-30% increase in pastry sales compared to those using outdated or poorly maintained cases.

**Enhanced Product Quality:** Maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels within the display case ensures that pastries remain fresh, flavorful, and visually appealing for a longer period. Consistent temperature prevents spoilage, while humidity control prevents drying or sogginess. This can significantly reduce waste and improve customer satisfaction. For instance, a bakery found that using a modern display case with humidity control extended the shelf life of their croissants by two days, reducing waste by 15%.

**Improved Hygiene and Safety:** Pastry display cases provide a hygienic environment for storing and showcasing baked goods, protecting them from contamination and maintaining food safety standards. Enclosed cases prevent exposure to dust, insects, and other environmental factors that can compromise the quality and safety of pastries. This is particularly important for businesses that must comply with strict food safety regulations. Regularly cleaning and sanitizing the display case ensures that pastries remain safe for consumption and reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses.

**Enhanced Presentation and Aesthetics:** A stylish and well-maintained pastry display case can enhance the overall aesthetics of your business, creating a positive impression on customers. The design of the display case should complement the decor of your establishment and showcase your pastries in an attractive and professional manner. This can help you attract new customers and build a loyal following. For example, a cafe owner reported that upgrading to a modern, visually appealing display case significantly improved the overall ambiance of their cafe, attracting more customers and increasing repeat business.

**Operational Efficiency:** Modern pastry display cases are designed for ease of use and maintenance, improving operational efficiency and reducing labor costs.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common customer questions about pastry display cases can help alleviate concerns and facilitate informed purchasing decisions.

**What is the ideal temperature range for a pastry display case?**
The Ideal temperature range for most pastry display cases is between 36掳F and 46掳F (2掳C and 8掳C). This range ensures that pastries remain fresh and safe for consumption without becoming too cold or freezing. Some delicate pastries may require slightly warmer temperatures, while cream-filled pastries may benefit from colder temperatures. Always refer to the manufacturer's recommendations and adjust the temperature settings according to the specific needs of your products.

**How often should I clean my pastry display case?**
A Pastry display case should be cleaned daily to maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of dirt, crumbs, and condensation. Wipe down the interior and exterior surfaces with a mild detergent and warm water. Pay particular attention to the glass panels, shelves, and door seals. Disinfect the display case regularly, especially in areas that come into contact with food. Remove and wash the shelves and trays periodically to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria. Regular cleaning not only ensures food safety but also enhances the appearance of the display case and extends its lifespan.

**What type of lighting is best for a pastry display case?**
Led lighting is the best option for pastry display cases due to its energy efficiency, long lifespan, and minimal heat emission. Led lights provide bright, uniform illumination that enhances the color, texture, and presentation of pastries. They also produce less heat than traditional fluorescent or incandescent bulbs, which helps maintain consistent temperature within the display case. Look for led lighting with adjustable brightness and color temperature options to customize the lighting to suit different types of pastries and display arrangements.

**Can I use a regular refrigerator as a pastry display case?**
While a regular refrigerator can technically keep pastries cold, it is not ideal for use as a pastry display case. Refrigerators are designed to maintain lower humidity levels, which can cause pastries to dry out and lose their freshness. Additionally, refrigerators typically lack the specialized features found in pastry display cases, such as adjustable humidity controls, optimal lighting, and attractive display designs. Using a regular refrigerator can compromise the quality and presentation of your pastries, potentially impacting sales and customer satisfaction.

She's very sweet and nice, she doesn't try to manipulate or interfere in our life. But she drives me CRAZY in ways I didn't know I could be driven crazy 😭😂 If they didn't live in another state I don't know what I would do but she comes here often enough, and always during my work week, that I expect her to be capable of making herself comfortable in my house.

Ok so picture the scene: 
It's 7am and I took a call for work (I'm a nurse) and I needed to fix something immediately. It was for a person that I barely know taking about 6 psych medications and his doctor royally screwed up his orders. The call came while I was letting my dogs out so I'm literally sitting on the floor with my laptop open with dogs barking and crying at the door. I'm 100% focused on what I'm doing. MIL comes up and starts peppering me with questions- Is there breakfast? Should I let the dogs in? Can I use the bathroom? I stopped for a second and explained that I need to focus on these orders, it will take 5 minutes and then I can help her and she says ""oh sure"" and then continues to ask questions which I proceed to ignore. When I stopped responding she just says to the air ""it's ok I will just go to my room,"" takes a cup of coffee and sat in her room for 20 minutes.

Like for real? You're going to send yourself to your room because I didn't stop what I was doing and open the cupboard with the oatmeal in it for you? Do you really need my permission to use the freaking bathroom?!? Uuuuugh. It's not even like she was sulking, she just was trying to give me space but she DIDN'T NEED to! 

I keep trying to figure out what it is that bugs me about her and I think it is this: She is so afraid to take up space that she takes up space. She needs her hand held through the simplest of tasks. She's been in my life for 15 years but doesn't trust me when I say she can help herself to whatever she can find in the cupboards. 

What makes it worse is that she drives my husband even more crazy 😂 So I have to tell him to be nice to his mother because it's not like she is doing anything horrible. She is almost childlike, it is the strangest thing. Whenever she is here I just grit and bear it and put my ""be nice"" hat on but that just makes me get irrationally angry.",2,1745323729.0,intj,0,1.0,False

I got a Casabrews CM5418 as a present and have lots of fun with exploring making good espresso.  I bought a DF54 as a grinder. But I'm wondering on how much I really can do good espreso with a nice flavour profile. Until now I didn't get to accomplish a well balanced shot and I tried to experiment with grinding finer (mostly because in 30 seconds I usually get about at least 80 grams of espresso) but as soon as I'm grinding a bit finer, my machine doesn't spill out more than a few drops of coffee. Now I got a really fruity, light roast (Manhattan coffee roasters, Sweet Valley, Espresso roast, 31 March 2025) and I thought I have do grind very fine because I tried the beans with another machine first. But my machine really struggled to work with this coarse and in 1.20 mins I got 25 grams of coffee. Of course I can grind coarser, but I thought maybe you guys have a suggestions for me and do you think with this machine I am even capable getting out shots with well balanced flavour profiles?

1k54mw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RBW_SOLUTIONS/comments/1k54mw4/musthave_pos_hardware_for_restaurants_and_cafes/,Must-have POS Hardware for restaurants and cafes,"There is so much more to running a café or restaurant than offering a great ambiance and delicious food to the patrons — you have to be operationally efficient as well. This is where a good POS (point-of-sale) system can be a game changer for you in every sense of the words. It can streamline the total process starting from taking orders to managing inventory and processing payments. However, only using the right software would not be enough in this case. You also need the right hardware to go with it to unlock the actual potential of the software.

**POS touchscreen monitor or terminal**

The terminal is always at the heart of every POS system. In most cases, it is a touchscreen monitor which plays the role of central command centers. This device lets your staff input orders, access the backend system, and process transactions. The most important factors that you need to look for in this case are durable designs, which are especially important in fast-paced and busy kitchens, compatibility with the POS software you are already using in your establishment, a responsive touch-based interface, and a sleek design especially when it is facing the customers. Most businesses in this case prefer robust all-inclusive terminals that have inbuilt card readers and printers. However, some also prefer to use iPads or tablets as well!

**Receipt printer**

This is the digital age but even now printed receipts are necessary for the majority of food service operators. You can use them in your kitchens along with KDS (kitchen display systems) or give them to the customers as records of their transactions. Thus a good receipt printer is something that you simply cannot dispense with. There are two kinds of receipt printers — thermal printers and impact or dot matrix printers. Thermal printers are quiet and fast, which is why they are ideal for front-of-house operations. The latter are ideal for kitchens because they can handle moisture and heat.

**Cash drawer**

Contactless payments are on the rise these days but in so many areas cash is still the regular method of payment. This is why a sturdy and secure cash drawer is so important for taking care of cash transactions and storing coins and bills safely. It is always better if the drawer is made of steel because that makes it more durable and it should have several coin and bill compartments as well. It must also integrate with your POS so that it can open automatically and it should be under key and lock security.

**Barcode scanner**

This is an optional feature in this case but useful. It may be commoner in retail establishments but they are becoming more useful in the food service sector as well. This is especially so for quick-service restaurants and cafes that sell retail items and packaged goods such as merchandise or coffee beans. They are useful because they can speed up checkouts, help manage inventory, and reduce human error. However, you must always select a scanner that is compatible with the POS system you are using and can read both 2D (two-dimensional) and 1D (one-dimensional) barcodes if needed.

**Kitchen printers or KDSs**

They can help streamline operations between back-of-house and front-of-house and this is why you must have them in your café or restaurant. KDSs are digital screens that display orders in real time thus reducing paper wastage and making your business more accurate. Kitchen printers are more of traditional setups that print orders on receipt papers. They are the ideal option for more traditional or smaller kitchens. KDS setups are especially beneficial in fast environments where efficiency and speed are critical.

**Card readers or payment terminals**

Diners these days expect flexible and seamless payment options. Having versatile card readers that are capable of supporting chip cards, mobile wallets like Google Pay and Apple Pay, and contactless or NFC (near-field communication) systems. These systems must have mobile or wireless capabilities that allow payments to be made at the table itself, encryption for security and PCI (payment card industry) compliance, and options for capturing signatures and tipping. Based on the POS provider whose services you have availed your card reader could come with the software itself — it may also be offered as third-party integration.

Apart from these, you also need customer-facing displays and backup and network devices in this context. Customer display screens enhance the total experience and add transparency as well! Backup and network devices offer you the dependable connection that you need to operate all the hardware properly.",1,1745323556.0,u_RBW_SOLUTIONS,0,1.0,False

She lives at home with her parents, and has no bills with the exception of a car payment and insurance on it. She only makes enough money to pay for those two bills, she establishes no savings and what little money she does end up with she wastes on overpriced coffee or games for her PC.

She works an entry level job in retail, and she only works 2-3 nights a week, each shift only lasting about 4 hours each. She constantly complains about her work never working her enough and that she doesn’t make enough money. I’ve suggested countless other places she could work that would not only pay her more hourly but also work her full time, but she’s afraid of change and sites her lack of wanting to leave her current work place because of her enjoyment of her coworkers.

Looking to the future I’m disappointed that she doesn’t want to better herself because I really love her and I know she loves me, I trust her in that regard. But we hope to be married and living together in the next couple years and it sounds like I alone am going to be footing the bill for everything, the wedding and all. It leaves me worried, like I can’t truly look forward to the future because I don’t have someone to share the responsibility with and lighten the load. The burden is all on me. I wish she’d prove to me she can be dependable.

I find myself just bored of her anymore because of this. Frankly, I just don’t feel like talking to her that much because I know any kind of conversation we have is going to spiral into her complaining about monetary issues. She just wants to complain about them and hope things get better without making any changes. It’s classic victim mentality, thinking the situation is happening TO her rather than because of her.

I don’t want to break up with her but if there isn’t going to be any changes I fear I’ll have no other choice.

Hi, everyone from the channel. My name is Luís… well, I’d rather not reveal my full name. I’ve been a subscriber for a while, and today I decided to share a story that still gives me chills every time I think about it. I’m a registered nurse now and currently work at a private hospital that’s part of a big network in my city. But back in 2014, I was just a nursing technician. I had just finished my vocational course, full of hope, resume in hand, walking all over town, dropping off paper wherever I could—clinics, private hospitals, tiny corner offices.

When I got a call for a temporary position at Santa Efigênia Public Hospital, I almost cried. It was an emergency contract, nothing solid, but with the night shift bonus, it was enough to pay rent on the small room I shared with a friend, buy food, and hold out until something better came along.

I started on a Monday in May. They put me on the 11 PM to 7 AM shift—the dreaded overnight. I was what they called a support tech, the go-to guy for everything. I’d run from one floor to another with medications, adjust oxygen levels, help transfer patients, change IV bags, check vitals—I didn’t stop. The hospital was old, built with 70s concrete, but it was still standing thanks to a handful of professionals who worked miracles with what little they had.

The first few nights were exhausting, but uneventful. Nights in a hospital are long. You start recognizing the sounds: the beeping of heart monitors, the echo of footsteps on cold tile floors, the muffled snores of patients in the hall. Sometimes the silence is so loud it feels like it’s screaming. And like every old building, Santa Efigênia had its creepy spots—creaky doors, flickering lights, footsteps where no one’s walking. You just learn to ignore it. Comes with the job.

But since my first night, something bothered me: the annex.
Behind the main hospital, separated by a covered walkway, was a smaller building. A two-story annex that used to house the old men’s ward, some observation beds, and the old pharmacy. All of that is now on the hospital’s top floor. The annex had been shut down for about two years after a fire. No one went in there anymore. The gate was sealed with a thick chain and two heavy padlocks. The sign, already faded by rain and time, read: “ANNEX – CLOSED OFF.”

It was weird thinking that, in a public hospital where space is always tight, a whole wing had been abandoned for so long.
But even closed off, it never felt truly deactivated.
At night, especially after 3 AM, it was common to hear creaking noises from that side. The janitor said it was the concrete settling. But I’d passed by and heard something else: a bed being dragged, a nurse call bell going off—other sounds.

One night, as I walked in for another shift, I looked at the rusted iron door of the annex and got the strange feeling something was behind it. It gave me chills.
In the main ward, the system showed all beds—occupied, free, being cleaned, etc.
And that night, at exactly 3:13 AM, a new admission popped up:

João Elias de Almeida – Bed 313.
But our hospital didn’t have a bed 313. The last one was 309.

I deleted the name. Thought it was a system glitch.
But the next night, same time, it came back.
I took out my phone, snapped a photo of the screen, and went straight to the night supervisor. She looked at it and took a deep breath.

“Just let it go, Luís. It’s happened before.”

“What do you mean?”

“We’ve already filed reports with I.T.… they say it’s an old bug. A database issue. Sometimes it pulls data from wings that don’t exist anymore. Just an old echo in the system.”

“Do you know who João Elias de Almeida is?” I asked.

She looked at me. Took a while to answer.

“It’s a public hospital, kid... what do you think?”

The third time it happened, the intercom rang. It was the front desk extension. But the screen said: EXTENSION 313.

I answered. Silence. Then—labored breathing, like someone out of breath. I hung up immediately.

Next shift, while sipping weak coffee in the cafeteria, old Mr. Silvio—the night security guard—started talking to me. He caught me staring at the hospital floor plan on the tiled wall.

“You’re curious about the annex, huh?” he asked, straight to the point.

I nodded, a bit sheepishly. He sighed.

“That place caught fire one night two years ago. Started on the top floor, the men’s ward. They said it was an electrical short in one of the rooms, but no one really believes that. Two patients died. And the weird thing… was the condition of the bodies.”

Silvio looked down, as if reliving the moment. Then continued:

“I was here that night. One of the first on the scene when the alarm went off. The smell of smoke was intense. The fire had already taken most of the men’s ward. The extinguishers weren’t enough. Firefighters arrived quickly, managed to get almost everyone out. All but two patients.”

He paused, gripping his paper cup tightly.

“When the firefighters found the bodies… one of them was untouched. The bed was intact. No soot, no burns. Not even the sheet was scorched. But the smell… it was like burnt death. Like the fire had happened inside him.”

I tried to laugh, call it an urban legend, but I choked when I heard the name of the dead: João Elias de Almeida.

Silvio squinted, like he was watching the scene all over again. His cup trembled, spilling coffee over the sides. He didn’t even notice.

“I saw him,” he whispered, like afraid someone else might hear. “Not back then. Months later. Maybe five months after the fire.”

I sat up straighter, trying to act skeptical. But my skin was crawling.

“I was walking down the main hallway, coming back from X-ray. Another quiet night. Just the hum of the A/C. Then I saw someone walking slowly, his back to me. Wearing a hospital gown, thinning hair. Barefoot. Looked lost.”

Silvio looked sideways, like watching the hallway again.

“I called out. ‘Sir, are you okay?’ Nothing. He just kept walking. But the way he moved... it was weird, like his feet touched the floor but didn’t really step. Like he was gliding.”

“You followed him?” I asked.

He nodded.

“When I turned the corner, he was gone. But the floor was stained. Like someone had just come from a coal furnace. Footprints. And they ended in the middle of the hallway. Just stopped. And that smell—” he wrinkled his nose, “the same as during the fire. Smoke and burnt flesh.”

I stayed quiet, a bitter taste rising in my throat. Silvio set his cup down, like he’d said what he needed to.

One time, I saw it with my own eyes.
It was a night like any other. The system beeped. “BED 313” lit up on the screen. And I decided to go to the annex.

I left my station, walked down the cold corridor. Outside, the sky was clear, no wind. But the hall to the annex felt freezing.
The gate was ajar. The chain on the floor. No padlock.
I pushed it open slowly. The building was fully lit inside. Like it was working. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The hallways were clean, like freshly mopped. The smell… that old hospital smell.

The annex elevator was working. The panel lit up. I went up to the top floor.
The doors opened with a dry clack.

In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed with a sheet over it. I walked toward it. My whole body shook with each step.

On the ID tag, it read:
BED 313
The sheet moved. Like someone was breathing underneath it.

With a trembling hand, I pulled it off in one go.
No one there. But the mattress was sunken, like someone had been lying there.

Footprints on the floor led to the wall. And vanished.

I ran to the elevator. It wouldn’t move.
I was stuck there for almost ten minutes. The bed stood between me and the stairs. I didn’t dare cross.

When I finally made it down, I went straight to the main ward. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my badge, and quit right there, hands still shaking.
The supervisor didn’t even ask why. She just looked at me and nodded—like she already knew.

In the following days, I tried to forget. Told myself it was exhaustion, lack of sleep, the pressure of night shifts. But something kept bothering me, nagging in the back of my mind: what really happened in that hospital all those years ago?

I did some digging on my own. Looked through public archives and found an old newspaper article.
The fire at the hospital killed two men.
One of them was João Elias de Almeida.
The other… was Silvio da Costa.

I just stared at the screen for a few minutes. Same face. Even the badge was visible, pinned to the burned uniform in the photo. Same security outfit. Same tired eyes.

I had spent months talking to a ghost.
A dead man.
A lingering echo of what remained in that old wing of the hospital.",1,1745323444.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

I tried to laugh, call it an urban legend, but I choked when I heard the name of the dead: João Elias de Almeida.

Silvio squinted, like he was watching the scene all over again. His cup trembled, spilling coffee over the sides. He didn’t even notice.

“I saw him,” he whispered, like afraid someone else might hear. “Not back then. Months later. Maybe five months after the fire.”

I sat up straighter, trying to act skeptical. But my skin was crawling.

“I was walking down the main hallway, coming back from X-ray. Another quiet night. Just the hum of the A/C. Then I saw someone walking slowly, his back to me. Wearing a hospital gown, thinning hair. Barefoot. Looked lost.”

Silvio looked sideways, like watching the hallway again.

“I called out. ‘Sir, are you okay?’ Nothing. He just kept walking. But the way he moved... it was weird, like his feet touched the floor but didn’t really step. Like he was gliding.”

“You followed him?” I asked.

He nodded.

“When I turned the corner, he was gone. But the floor was stained. Like someone had just come from a coal furnace. Footprints. And they ended in the middle of the hallway. Just stopped. And that smell—” he wrinkled his nose, “the same as during the fire. Smoke and burnt flesh.”

I stayed quiet, a bitter taste rising in my throat. Silvio set his cup down, like he’d said what he needed to.

One time, I saw it with my own eyes.
It was a night like any other. The system beeped. “BED 313” lit up on the screen. And I decided to go to the annex.

I left my station, walked down the cold corridor. Outside, the sky was clear, no wind. But the hall to the annex felt freezing.
The gate was ajar. The chain on the floor. No padlock.
I pushed it open slowly. The building was fully lit inside. Like it was working. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The hallways were clean, like freshly mopped. The smell… that old hospital smell.

The annex elevator was working. The panel lit up. I went up to the top floor.
The doors opened with a dry clack.

In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed with a sheet over it. I walked toward it. My whole body shook with each step.

On the ID tag, it read:
BED 313
The sheet moved. Like someone was breathing underneath it.

With a trembling hand, I pulled it off in one go.
No one there. But the mattress was sunken, like someone had been lying there.

Footprints on the floor led to the wall. And vanished.

I ran to the elevator. It wouldn’t move.
I was stuck there for almost ten minutes. The bed stood between me and the stairs. I didn’t dare cross.

When I finally made it down, I went straight to the main ward. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my badge, and quit right there, hands still shaking.
The supervisor didn’t even ask why. She just looked at me and nodded—like she already knew.

In the following days, I tried to forget. Told myself it was exhaustion, lack of sleep, the pressure of night shifts. But something kept bothering me, nagging in the back of my mind: what really happened in that hospital all those years ago?

I did some digging on my own. Looked through public archives and found an old newspaper article.
The fire at the hospital killed two men.
One of them was João Elias de Almeida.
The other… was Silvio da Costa.

I just stared at the screen for a few minutes. Same face. Even the badge was visible, pinned to the burned uniform in the photo. Same security outfit. Same tired eyes.

I had spent months talking to a ghost.
A dead man.

I only work saturdays 9-4. 

But since jan (we’ve been renovating since last nov) she’s opened a little cafe portion of the training academy next door, just to make some more money and obviously as my last job was in food, i already have some experience in making coffee and stuff so i just started working there 4 days a week bc of uni while still doing Saturdays at the salon/academy. In Jan i did a lot of late shifts and staying behind working the logistics of things with her and doing admin also for the cafe and paperwork etc . At the end of Jan because it was so chaotic - we just ooened and still working things out (and i this is entirely my fault but please keep reading) i forgot to fill my timesheet in (51 hours) and my boss said no problem she will just roll it over to februarys pay. So i work feb as normal, still no pay at the end of feb for january OR February so obviously im not an idiot im not going to work any more hours because she may not even pay me for those, and what a coincidence i actually end up getting covid and take 3 weeks off work. I keep asking for updates and for my money during these 3 weeks and she finally sends me some random amount on March 20th ?? I don’t even know what this amount is for but I know it’s not what im owed. When I return to work she’s said she’s letting me go from the salon and academy but is happy to pay me a day rate for any work as and when she needs it, she said I’m still working in the cafe.

I work a week but something happened during a shift with my coworker, she literally disappeared during her shift and left me to deal with 5 customers on my own snd when she came back it was clear she went to snitch on me to my boss, i don’t even know what about. I didn’t ask where she’s been bc i don’t care and i deduced it already so i just ask her to wash up. I could see her washing up so slowly on purpose like she was literally playing with the soap and not washing anything just pretending to, so I’m like well clearly she doesn’t wanna be here so ill tell boss she wants to go home because now she’s just taking up unnecessary space behind the coffee bar. I tell my boss and she comes over snd asks what’s the issue, i said well she literally disappeared during her shift surely ur not saying thats allowed? She said again, what’s the issue, and that’s when i realise I’m not going to win here and this isn’t the place for me and my time here is up, so i just say, okay well if YOU think there’s no issue then there’s no issue. So the next shift i don’t turn up. Mostly because i didn’t want to and she said she’s been doing the rota monthly now but hasn’t sent it to anyone or posted it anywhere, how on earth would I know if im in or not? Either way obviously I’ve checked out of this job so when she asks me if I’m coming in i tell her i quit, but by this time its the beginning of April snd i still haven’t been paid what I’m owed. In total it’s 79 hours of work. I told her if she doesn’t pay me I’ll have to get ACAS involved and she said she’ll send it on the 15th, it’s now the 22nd and I’ve not been sent anything. I’m waiting to hear back from ACAS early conciliation. 

Any thoughts or comments are appreciated about the situation, I don’t care much about the job because I graduate in a month and will find a good graduate job with my degree but it’s also about the principle and that I’m not letting go 3 months of unpaid work where not only was I unpaid but also had to tolerate so much disrespect from my boss. 
She tends to be quite petty so I think she’s going to make this as hard as possible. ACAS have already given me a reference number but I haven’t had any other correspondence about being assigned a conciliator or anything.

Throughout our relationship, I've felt constant pressure to be more romantic and outgoing, while struggling with my mental health and focusing on keeping us financially stable.

# First Breaking Point

Around the 4.5-year mark, I was completely burned out. Running my own business while managing mental and physical health issues had left me anxious, irritated, and low on energy. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was feeling pressure mainly from people on her socials getting married, having babies and so on.

She began pushing me toward marriage, and I felt pressured into proposing during our vacation. After that came her friend's wedding, which I attended reluctantly. The bachelor party became my breaking point – I didn't know anyone, was bullied and made fun of, and the experience left me traumatized. I had a complete mental breakdown.

After returning home, I confided in her about experiencing a complete mental breakdown. I explained that I needed to heal and was considering checking into some kind of facility or spa for a week or two. Rather than showing concern, she became angry with me—not because I was struggling, but because I hadn't offered to bring her along.

That moment became the turning point. I realized it was time to end our relationship.

What followed were multiple exhausting conversations where I felt entirely misunderstood. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to move out while she was at work. Despite having always been the one financially supporting us, I sold our apartment and provided her with enough money to secure her own mortgage. At that point, I simply needed space to rebuild myself.. 

# The 6 Month Break

During our separation, I quit my job, focused on healing, and returned to hobbies I'd abandoned. Honestly was depressed and in a bad place, was even contemplating suicide. We both tried to date other people unsuccessfully. Eventually she started calling constantly until I gave in. About a year ago, we reconciled and moved in together again – she rented out her apartment and joined me in my new place.

# Where We Are Now

A year after getting back together, she's doing well financially – living rent-free with me while collecting income from her apartment. I even bought her a new car last month. But emotionally, we're dealing with the exact same problems as before.

The core issue remains her need for constant affection. If there's even a short period without romantic attention – like going a week without sex – she starts nagging and we end up fighting. Nothing I do seems enough, even though I show love in my own ways: hugs, kisses, deep talks, bringing her coffee, helping with errands, maintaining her car, and paying for appointments. I even arranged for her to take three months off work so we could take a road trip together. None of that seems to matter when she feels she hasn't received enough attention for a week or two. Everything seems to go through the window.

# Our Latest Fight

Yesterday exemplified our problem perfectly. After an exhausting weekend spent with both her as well as my parents, I needed just one day to recover, catch up on work, and prepare for the week ahead. I told her that like two times. Yet still, on my only day off, she pressured me to go out biking. I declined, and she went alone.

While she was out, a friend made a surprise visit, we talked for some time and he left. After my fiancee returned, I told her that my friend visited me, and my fiancee became visibly irritated and poured herself a drink. We watched TV together, then went to lie down around 6pm. I was exhausted and saw my friend messaged me, so I started texting with him. My fiaancee became furious, threw a tantrum about ""all the attention"" I give to my friend, and stormed out to the living room where she eventually began frantically cleaning at 9pm. Feeling angry and overwhelmed, I left my own home for an hour just to get away.

When I returned, I tried once again to explain my situation – that I was drained from the weekend, affected by my ADD medication which makes me less emotional, dealing with health issues, and simply not able to be the romantic, energetic partner she wants right now. I need to take care of myself before I can share energy and joy with her. But she didn't seem to understand, and instead criticized me for not buying flowers for our ""6th anniversary"" (which I don't even count as a full six years since we were apart for six months). In the end she just nodded and we went to sleep. Now instead of starting my week I can't even focus or work for that matter, I feel completely messed up.

# My Current Dilemma

I'm starting to understand that my girlfriend might be struggling with depression and lof self-worth herself – her mother is extremely depressed and manipulative, and I see similar patterns in her behavior. She doesn't have real close friends, nor hobbies. Instead, she seems to prefer chasing endless adventures while criticizing me if she's not getting enough validation from me. Though she's aware of this, I'm losing hope that she'll ever work on herself.

As painful as it is to admit, I'm seriously questioning whether she's emotionally stable enough for us to have a future together, even though we've been planning to get married in the next 6-10 months.

Fact is, I'm not going to build any feature with a person who keeps getting silently resentful and throws childish tantrums in order to victimize herself and frankly has needs that I'm not able to always meet. I don't even understand why she reached out to me during the break, if I was that bad in the first place. I mean she knew exactly what she was signing for...

Currently I'm thinking of suggesting couple's therapy, but at this point I don't even know where to start or if it's even worth to put my time and limited energy if fundamentally she doesn't understand the issue...

1k54e1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Turnip28/comments/1k54e1e/question_from_a_newcomer_is_there_any_overlap/,"Question from a newcomer: Is there any overlap between Zeno Clash fans and Turnip28 fans? If not, do you think there *could* be overlap? I feel like folks could really come together, with one inspiring the other.","For those who don't know what Zeno Clash is, here's an explanation

**SETTING**  
It is a gnorpy morpy florpy primitive world inhabitated by all manner of monsters, mutants, aberrations and idiots. There seems to be no concept of ""human""-- as long as you can consciously communicate and wear clothing, you are considered a Zeno.  
There are remnants of more structural and intelligently made things, such as a talking door, ancient temples and ruins of a watchtower, and the only city in the land known as Halstedom.  
But nowadays, Halstedom and Zenozoik is made out of ""whatever works"". There is little in the way of central unified culture, neither in clothing nor architecture. It's all ramshackle, bits and bobs mashed together to fulfill a general function-- or just because a Zeno liked it. (like wearing bull horns in your afro). Colorful and fascinating.

**WEAPONS AND CLOTHING**  
Again: Whatever works/if the Zeno likes it. Masks are used for codpieces and thigh plates, crabs are used for masks, moose antlers for bras and of course pans as helmets.  
There are crude firearms such as:  
\- Petrified fish bodies used for what seems to be pebble-shooting pressure-powered handguns  
\- A primitive powder rifle made from a (human?) spine for the barrel  
\- A double crossbow (think Stranger's Wrath) shooting shrunken heads  
\- A primitive grenade launcher shooting human skull grenades, with the snout of a cow skull used for the sights  
But there's also more conventional weaponry, like:  
\- A small anvil with an engraved face mounted on a thick stick to use as a hammer  
\- A sword/club made out of a pelvis for the handguard and bones tied to the central wood piece  
\- A club made of a long thin birdcage stuffed full with rocks.

And there's also a hookah made of mannequin legs and a long dead snake.  
Plus a gimp with a coffee pot for a helmet lounging in a bar where one of the lamps looks like a H.R. Giger sea monster.

**SOCIETY AND RULES**  
There are no currency, central government, or even laws.  
\*Except\* for the 2023 prequel and the One Law.  
Prior to a fistfight, you can challenge the opponent to a short dice game. Both set up a Loss condition for the loser, such as:  
\- The loser coating themselves in something that attracts bees, meaning they have to move or take damage  
\- The loser having their leg tied to a peg in the ground by a length of rope, reducing their mobility to a particular environment for a while.  
\- The loser having to drink either snake or spider poison (Snake poison makes them periodically stagger, spider poison slowly drains health)  
\- Setting up a small arena, denoted with a fence of sticks, and the first to get knocked out has to accept getting hit with a club  
\- The loser becoming tied to a Summon artifact to call upon in a future battle (if you win the Ritual, that is)  
\- Summoning a wild predator that will attack enemies but can attack you too.

**FACTIONS:**  
\- Father-Mother's Family, the children of a bird-like giant that take many different shapes. Powerful gang in Halstedom, the only city.  
\- The Northern Gate Gang, an opposing gang in Halstedom.  
\- The Corwids of the Free. They choose a singular obsession or focus in their live and abandon all sense of morality or even care for hunger, sickness, cold, morals and ethics. Doing stuff like only walking in a straight line and if there's a tree in the way, you just wait until the tree's gone or you die.  
Or making pigeons bleed.  
\- The Tiamte. They look kinda like something between a shell-less lobster and a humanoid and have developed a discriminative racial superiority complex & caste system, where your standing is defined by how big you are, if you have a leather coat and how many masks you wear.  
Worship a statue of a big foot with an eyeball above the ankle.  
\- The Wandering Players (2023 prequel), a cult of Zenos that follow the Director, who believes he heard the music that determines the role of everything in creation and seeks to make everyone and everything obey their given role.  
\- The Mu-Wuhm Marauders. In Zeno Clash 2 someone tries to set up a law enforcement organization which chases out the worst of the worst, but leads to them banding together to form a brutal marauder tribe.   
They ritually chop off their own feet as payment to the Feet Collector. Normally he'd stab his allies in the back and steal their feet himself, so this ensures his cooperation.  
\- Gemini's Mercenaries (2023 prequel). About a dozen different Zenos that come back time and again in different team-ups. From a surprisingly heroic giant Platybelodon man to an arrogant goose woman that throws boomerangs and does cartwheels.  


It is a VERY different flavor of the Napoleontic mudpuddle that is the setting of Turnip28-- more tribal and primitive (the land isn't called Zenozoik for nothing) and the world is brutal though still quite healthy.   
But yet i feel like fans of either could be interested in each others' world. I \*hope\* that a lot of the things i mentioned could be inspiring and bring folks together.

What do you think?

1k54dz4,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/05/we-know-the-pain-freed-india-coffee-workers-lead-way-from-bonded-labour,Labour practices in coffee industry,"I had posted a thread last week about how the coffee scene in India is exploitative towards its labourers and the farming culture in places like Chikmagalur and all where coffee precedes all other crops due to the fact that it is a cash crop. I spoke to a friend of a friend who is a farmer and was saying how the burgeoning urban coffee culture is hurting the farmers.

I have always been sceptical of the specialty coffee we have on offer with their exorbitant prices and almost familial relationship they market on their websites with their labourers and farmers. If there is no cooperative or unions for the workers, I am certain there are labour malpractices happening. ‘We are like a family’ is a red flag for me. That’s how slave culture thrived.

From that conversation, I think as consumers we can start demanding other coffee variants like Robusta and Liberica instead of the overemphasis on Arabica. It is also cheaper than Arabica and allows farmers more variety. I suppose you can tell that I do hold some resentment towards coffee being such an elite beverage now in the recent decades, even though I also find it aspirational to geek out on it.

I am sharing some articles but none are extensive its research and journalism. I fear since the fourth wave of coffee in India is recent, the awareness is still low.

Please share your thoughts. I want to know what other coffee drinkers feel about this and what can we do.

(I have to emphasise that I have no real-world knowledge about the business of coffee and am posting here either to hear opposing views or confirmation about this. So if you are someone from the business of coffee I am most curious to hear from you.)

I'm starting the ACA this autumn on a grad scheme so though of posting here. This is going to get downvoted but I don't care I just need to vent. 

I'm a final year and unfortunately applying for jobs hasn't gone as planned. I only wanted prestigious MBB consulting and was extremely bitter for not getting an elite internship in my second year. 

I was unsuccessful again when recruiting for MBB in final year and have unfortunately had to reluctantly accept an offer for a low prestige industry role. The pay is decent in a low cost of living region and the money goes a lot further than a high salary in London. 

The company has a few ex-consultants, but in my eyes these are just the guys who couldn't hack it at MBB and washed out into an inferior job. 

My prospective firm has been very welcoming and everyone there has said they're really looking forward to me joining, but I'm literally only joining them because I couldn't get the MBB offer I wanted unfortunately. 

They've invited me to a dinner with the wider team which I declined and made up an excuse for because I was just so disappointed over how my career has gone and that I've ruined everything and have wasted all of this effort over the past few years to still not get into MBB. 

They have some industry award nights which are black tie events for various firms across the industry to celebrate various high performing employees, and they've invited me because I still haven't met the wider team despite having been invited for coffee on various occasions. 

They will be taking pictures at this event and I just don't want to attend and have my picture taken because they post on LinkedIn (as they have done every year) and I don't want people I know finding out how far I've fallen off compared to the goals I've had to end up in a mediocre position. 

I know this sounds stupid but I've been getting deranged with regret and resentment especially over the past few months and need some clarity on what to do. 

It would be weird if I said ""please don't post any pictures of me"" but if I cancel again they will assume I'm just not interested since I feel one of them is getting that vibe already because they've become less enthusiastic with me.  ",0,1745322788.0,ICAEW,17,0.21,False

1k54cwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k54cwv/how_do_you_get_your_brain_to_shut_up/,How do you get your brain to shut up?,"My brain is a constant stream of consciousness and sometimes it drives me up the wall. When I take my medication it quiets down, but when I don't it's exhausting. So for example I woke up early this morning and can't fall back asleep because I can't get my mind to be quiet.

I'm not necessarily looking for ""try meditation/mindfulness practices."" My therapist has given me techniques, but sometimes I'm not in the mood or mindset to do that. Additionally, when I say this to non-ADHD'ers I think they interpret the racing thoughts as anxiety. While some of it may be due to that, sometimes it just feels like there's a person in my brain who just won't be quiet. Like sometimes I get a song stuck in my head and it just won't go away no matter what. Or I jump from thought to thought like, ""Since I'm awake early I should go get coffee,"" to ""I really hope the Oblivion remake drops during the live today,"" and on and on with any little thing that pops into my head. None of those thoughts are inherently distressing, but I'm just annoyed. If I can't fall back asleep I wish I could just sit here quietly. 

I feel like my post has been all over the place, sorry about that lol so what do you all do?? I thought about maybe reading or playing a game, but everything feels kind of overstimulating when what I want is to calm down. Thanks in advance!",6,1745322696.0,ADHD,14,1.0,False

She lives at home with her parents, and has no bills with the exception of a car payment and insurance on it. She only makes enough money to pay for those two bills, she establishes no savings and what little money she does end up with she wastes on overpriced coffee or games for her PC.

She works an entry level job in retail, and she only works 2-3 nights a week, each shift only lasting about 4 hours each. She constantly complains about her work never working her enough and that she doesn’t make enough money. I’ve suggested countless other places she could work that would not only pay her more hourly but also work her full time, but she’s afraid of change and sites her lack of wanting to leave her current work place because of her enjoyment of her coworkers.

Looking to the future I’m disappointed that she doesn’t want to better herself because I really love her and I know she loves me, I trust her in that regard. But we hope to be married and living together in the next couple years and it sounds like I alone am going to be footing the bill for everything, the wedding and all. It leaves me worried, like I can’t truly look forward to the future because I don’t have someone to share the responsibility with and lighten the load. The burden is all on me. I wish she’d prove to me she can be dependable.

I find myself just bored of her anymore because of this. Frankly, I just don’t feel like talking to her that much because I know any kind of conversation we have is going to spiral into her complaining about monetary issues. She just wants to complain about them and hope things get better without making any changes. It’s classic victim mentality, thinking the situation is happening TO her rather than because of her.

I don’t want to break up with her but if there isn’t going to be any changes I fear I’ll have no other choice.

1k547q4,https://i.redd.it/aly6rlp1jdwe1.jpeg,SSP Burr upgrade? [LMLM and Atom 75],"Hi all

I have the following setup:



Eureka Atom 75   
La Marzocco Linea Micra   
Naked portafilter with Pullman 17-19g basket  
Motta 58.4mm Competition tamper  
WDT tool ( [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C3H83MQH](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C3H83MQH) )  
A ""wedge"" distributor ( [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07QC558KN](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07QC558KN) )  
Normcore puck screen (with the hole to accomodate the LMLM round screw)  
Good quality, fresh beans (always used between 8 and 21 days post roasting, mostly from Origin but mix in some other beans from other places too, most recently [[this one](https://www.departmentofcoffee.com/shop/the-hype-colombia-elbombo-cwsrd-a5hbp-b2na4-p7hll) ] from the same batch as used in a coffee shop where I tried it!)

My general process is grind, WDT, ""wedge"", distribute, tamp.

I've been using the grinder for a few years, originally with a Sage Oracle and for the last \~6 months with the LMLM(icra), and broadly love it, but still can't help but thinking the grinder isn't perfect.

I'm having two issues

  
1) Channeling - no matter how much care I put into the puck prep, having tried with and without all of the various steps above (e.g. with and without WDT and/or distributing), various pre-brew settings vs no pre-brew, different baskets etc, I still consistently get a bit of ""spattering"" even if i'm getting a perfect 18g in 36g out in 30 seconds, and I have to clean off the top of the cup and the splashback etc. It's mildly annoying for that, but I'm more concerned about it being an indicator for a bigger issue. The fact I've tried all of the different iterations means to me the only thing left is the grinder?

2) I almost exclusively drink flat whites, and when I compare the coffee I get to what I have from my favourite coffee shops, it still feels like it's missing a bit of ""punch"" even using literally the same beans.  
  
  
If I had unlimited money, I'd probably just get a Mahlkonig E80S GBW (which all of my favourite shops now use), but that's a VERY expensive option (and i'd love to try one alongside my Atom first), so I'm looking to see if I can ""extract"" even more from this grinder first.   
  
There are lots of threads about the burrs vs the Mythos burrs, and everything seems to come back to them being the same geometry with different coatings, so they wont make any real difference to the output in reality. Can anyone give brutally honest feedback on the SSP burrs and if they're worth the \~£300 investment? I can only find the opinions of one redditer from years ago and they indicated it did reduce channeling and improve clarity for them, but that's a VERY small pool of people...

On the one hand, £300 is a lot of money if it doesn't make much difference, but equally, that £300 is a drop in the ocean compared to the £2000-2500 if I want to upgrade to a grinder that is unanimously rated better than this one, so it almost feels worth a punt!

Don't get me wrong, the coffee is still absolutely incredible, far better than I get from most coffee shops bar the proper specialists, and it might just be a placebo, but I feel like I'm just missing that last bit....

Cheers!

A few people asked what I typically eat during the day, so here’s what a typical day looks like for me. I almost always have either greek yoghurt or egg toast for breakfast with some fruit and a matcha latte (today I had coffee instead since I was out of matcha). Matcha is great with aiding weight loss and has a lot of other health benefits. Most days I have a little snack during the day as well, usually dark chocolate or another matcha latte with honey which I find really helps when I’m craving something sweet. 

Breakfast - Greek yoghurt with granola, blueberries, watermelon and coffee with oat milk: 509 calories 

Lunch - Lemon cod, potato, broccoli and hollandaise sauce: 357 calories. I eat this multiple times a week either with cod or salmon. 

Dinner - Chicken with quinoa and green beans: 491 calories

	•	AI-powered workout suggestions
	•	Pomodoro & Tabata mode
	•	Beautiful UX (check the screenshot!)
	•	Workout history tracking
	•	Sound/vibration options to keep you dialed in

Ever hit that familiar wall on a project: do you grab that tempting open-source package, or dive down the 'build it yourself' rabbit hole?

Maybe you've found a library that looks perfect for the project's needs. But... then the cold feet set in, thinking about the recent trend of OSS projects shifting licenses, especially in the .NET space (looking at you, MediatR, AutoMapper, MassTransit and even FluentAssertions ). It's enough to make anyone's 'dependency trust issues' flare up.

We all know the pros of using existing packages:

* **Speed Boost**: Saves potentially weeks of dev time. Magic!
* **Community Tested**: Hopefully squashed bugs you haven't even dreamed of yet.
* **Shared Maintenance**: Someone else might fix it when it breaks.

But the risks feel more tangible lately:

* **License Roulette**: The rug pull of a license change forcing expensive rewrites or unexpected costs for your team.
* **Surprise! It's Paid Now**: Suddenly needing a subscription for a core piece you thought was free.
* ""**Can't we just use the old version?**"" We've all heard (or thought) it! And yes, technically, you can often stick with the last permissive version. But that means no more updates. No bug fixes for issues found later, no performance improvements, and crucially, no security patches for vulnerabilities discovered in that version you're now frozen on. It's a ticking clock.
* **The Abandoned Repo**: We've all stumbled into those digital ghost towns (last commit: 4 years ago), leaving you holding the bag.

Then there's building it in-house:

* **Total Control**: Your code, your rules. Feels good.
* **License Peace of Mind**: No midnight emails about new terms impacting your project.
* **Tailor-Made**: Exactly the features you need, no extra baggage.

But let's be honest about the downsides:

* **Slower Pace**: Reinventing solutions takes time your team might not have.
* **""Not Invented Here"" Reality Check**: Is my hand-rolled solution *really* going to be as robust as something battled-tested?  😉
* **The Maintenance Treadmill**: Every single bug, every single update – it's all on your team.

So, how are you all approaching this decision these days? What factors weigh most heavily for you? What's your tipping point for choosing one path over the other?

Review,"Using the **Gevi Household GIMN-1000C Black With Auto Refill Nugget Ice Maker** has transformed the way I enjoy chilled beverages. As someone who values good design and functionality, this nugget ice maker made a compelling case for me to test it daily. From its aesthetic appeal to its practical features, this machine offers quite an experience, although there are minor aspects to keep in mind.

**Sleek Design and Compact Build**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the stainless steel housing with its classy black finish and viewing window. This machine doesn’t scream “appliance” on the countertop but blends in seamlessly with my modern kitchen decor. Its 17.3"" x 9.7"" x 16.7"" size is thoughtful, fitting snugly beneath most wall cabinets. The compact build didn’t feel overwhelming, even with limited counter space.

[Want the lowest Gevi Household GIMN-1000C price? Click Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dnsncgcm/)

**Performance That Delivers Chewable Joy**  
The nugget—or gemi—ice that this machine produces is nothing short of amazing. Unlike the hard-cube ice from traditional freezers, the chewable texture is perfect for iced coffee, cocktails, or just munching. Producing up to 30 pounds of ice in 24 hours, it ensures I never run out during gatherings or even on lazy Sunday afternoons when iced tea cravings hit. The 4.8-pound ice basket was an adequate size too, saving me constant trips to refill.

**Convenience of Dual Water Filling Options**  
One of the standout features is the dual water refill system. I opted to connect it to my water supply using the included 10-foot hose, sparing me the manual hassle during busy days. When I tried the manual refill option, it was also user-friendly with a lid that’s easy to open. This flexibility makes it adaptable for both constant-party hosts or occasional ice users.

**Quieter Ice Production**  
Noisy appliances can turn a great product into a frustrating experience, but that’s not the case here. Thanks to the high-performance compressor and smart design, this nugget ice maker remains impressively muted. Even with the kitchen adjacent to the living room, I didn’t find the noise disruptive—a big relief compared to my older ice maker.

**Perks**  
- Fabulous chewable nugget ice for versatile uses.  
- Chic, stainless steel design with a compact form.  
- Large daily capacity (up to 30 pounds of ice).  
- Flexible water filling: connect to a water line or add manually.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- At 38 pounds, moving it isn’t exactly light work.  
- The viewing window fogs up occasionally, hampering the “how much ice do I have” glance.  
- Its price point might be a stretch if you don’t use nugget ice frequently.

**Other Handy Features**  
A self-cleaning mode adds to the convenience factor. With just the press of a button, I activated the cleaning cycle, and this came in handy after a particularly long week of heavy use. This feature prevents any slime or odor issues that can build up in such devices, especially with frequent use.

**Direct Competitors**  
Having tested other nugget ice makers like the Opal Nugget Ice Maker and the KBice Self-Dispensing Countertop Nugget Ice Maker, the Gevi stands out in quiet operation. The Opal, while offering great spherical nuggets, tends to be noisier and requires regular manual cleaning. On the other hand, the KBice model offers self-dispensing functionality but feels bulkier. In comparison, the Gevi strikes a balance between style, feature set, and performance, albeit at the expense of slightly more weight.

**Budget-Friendly**  
This nugget ice maker falls in the “bang for the buck” category if you’re someone who loves fresh, chewable ice every day. Several units at a similar price point don’t include auto-refill or self-cleaning features, which makes this machine feel more premium by comparison. While not cheap, the combination of convenience features and build quality leans toward offering decent value.

I usually work every holiday to do these type of donations and help our community. My dad asked my partner a few weeks before the holiday and they said it wasn’t a big deal and would have the holiday off.

Fast forward to Easter Day, it was slightly busy around the kitchen and we also had some customers for take out but it wasn’t anything crazy workload wise. After we got done in the afternoon my sister texted me if we wanted to go to mini golf with her and her boyfriend. So we agreed and got ice cream and had a great time. 

Yesterday me and my partner both had the day off and thought it would be a great time to go on a date go shopping and sit at a coffee shop. By the time we left the house and went to the store, my partner got a call from their mother saying “why did you turn off your location?, you were supposed to come home for Easter” and my partner replied with “Oh I had to work at (other job that wasn’t the one they were actually working)” and the 5 minute conversation felt very tense.

When they got off the phone I asked why did they lie to their own mother for Easter and by doing so lied to me in the process. I got upset and started whisper yelling inside the store because it wasn’t mandatory for them to help my family. 

They didn’t give me a concrete answer. We often discuss for them to visit family because the past few years they’ve only showed up to thanksgiving and Christmas family parties after a couple days of the holiday. 

The family is really sweet and overall pleasant to be around, and I know they don’t have any present issues with their mom dad and other siblings. So I got heated when they told me they’d rather hang out with mine. It’s strange to only visit family two to three days out of the whole year given our age, and I hope I’m not overreacting at the situation because their mom seemed very distressed and worried.

Since then I haven’t said a word and not know what to do besides give them a cold shoulder, AITAH?

1k540xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k540xf/could_the_ninja_pb051_singleserve_coffee_maker/,Could the Ninja PB051 Single-Serve Coffee Maker Review Change Your Daily Routine?,"**Compact Design with Versatility in Mind**  
Using the Ninja PB051 Pod & Grounds Single-Serve Coffee Maker has been a game-changer for my mornings. Its compact design, measuring just 13.07""D x 5.51""W x 13.31""H, fits so perfectly on my kitchen counter that I barely notice it’s there. For someone who has a cluttered countertop (guilty as charged), this sleek coffee maker is a blessing. It even has a storage drawer to stash the brew basket or permanent filter, keeping everything neat and accessible. Convenience? Check.

**Brewing Options Galore**  
This coffee maker excels in providing brewing versatility. With the ability to brew grounds in sizes from 6 to 24 ounces or use coffee pods ranging from 6 to 12 ounces, the options seem limitless. I’m a classic coffee drinker sometimes, while on other days, I enjoy experimenting with over-ice coffee or rich specialty brews. The four distinct styles—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty—are not just marketing fluff; they genuinely cater to every coffee hankering I’ve had. Honestly, I can’t look at other single-serve machines the same way.  

[Check Ninja PB051 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c25y15tl/)

**Thermal Flavor Extraction Delivers Every Time**  
The Thermal Flavor Extraction DUO technology deserves praise for enhancing both coffee pod and grounds brewing. Single-serve machines sometimes compromise on flavor; I’d almost resigned myself to weak, lackluster coffee at home. This proved me wrong. The even saturation and precision temperature control make brewing flavorful coffee—whether from pods or grounds—a daily treat. Bonus points for the rich coffee concentrate it creates for coffeehouse-style drinks.

**Built-In Frother for Latte Lovers**  
One standout feature for me is the built-in frother. Hot or cold milk or even milk alternatives can be whipped into a silky froth within moments. My attempts at brewing lattes or cappuccinos at home have often fallen flat—pun intended. But this frother makes it ridiculously easy to create drinks that mimic what I’d spend $6 on at a café... all from the comfort of my kitchen.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and space-saving design for small kitchens.  
- Excellent brewing versatility: pods or grounds, with different sizes and styles.  
- Build-in frother allows you to create barista-quality drinks at home.  
- A removable and easy-to-refill 56-ounce water reservoir means fewer annoying trips to the sink.  

**Caveats**  
- The reusable filter sometimes struggles with very finely ground coffee; you may see some sediment.  
- The device feels sturdy overall, but certain plastic components—such as the pod adapter—feel slightly less robust.  
- Frothing milk is efficient, but if you prefer heavy cream, the results may not be as consistent.  

**Customization for the Go-Getter**  
As someone who works from home and occasionally needs to head out in the morning rush, I’ve greatly appreciated its ability to fit travel mugs up to 8 inches tall. Plus, the removable 56-ounce water reservoir extends my laziness—no need to refill every single day! Whether I need a quick cup or plan a larger brew to share, this machine adapts seamlessly.

**Peer Products: Rival Machines in the Market**  
While this machine is outstanding, I’ve tested similar products like the Keurig Duo and Nespresso Vertuo. Keurig’s model scores points for speed and simplicity but doesn’t offer the same finesse in taste. The Nespresso system has incredible crema but locks you into their proprietary pods, which can limit versatility and hike up costs. In comparison, the Ninja PB051 stands out for its compatibility with both pods and grounds, making it far more practical for diverse coffee preferences.

**Quality for Price Assessment**  
Given its feature-heavy design, this product offers fantastic value for anyone looking to elevate their coffee game. While it’s not the cheapest single-serve coffee maker, that’s precisely the point—it’s an investment in quality and versatility. The money I’ve saved cutting down on coffee shop visits practically pays for the machine over time. I’ve owned several coffee makers in the past, and this is the first one that doesn’t feel like a compromise in one area or another.

The rise in the coffee prices has been alarming to say the least. My favourite coffee joint used to sell it at ₹15 in those days (2022). It was ₹25 till a week back. Now they have bumped up the price to ₹30 for a 150-200 ml cup of coffee. That's alroughly 26% in 3 years. 

Even your equity investments won't return that much in the long run. The govt. CPI inflation figures of 7% is a joke.

1k53v3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameSetup/comments/1k53v3e/are_gaming_chairs_waterproof/,Are gaming chairs waterproof?,"Josh had always been an avid gamer. After years of sitting on a regular office chair that squeaked every time he leaned back, he finally decided to treat himself to a proper gaming chair. He went all in—black and red racing-style design, built-in lumbar support, and even adjustable armrests. The chair looked sleek, felt comfortable, and gave his setup a much-needed upgrade. But there was one thing Josh hadn’t considered: what would happen if he spilled something on it?

A couple of weeks into owning the chair, it happened. Josh was in the middle of a long gaming session with his friends when his elbow knocked over a can of soda sitting on his desk. It wasn’t a full spill, just a splash—but enough to soak the seat of his new gaming chair. He jumped up, grabbed some paper towels, and started patting it down, slightly panicked.

While wiping it up, he realized the soda hadn’t soaked through as quickly as it would have on his old fabric office chair. That got him thinking: was his gaming chair waterproof?

Josh went online and started searching forums, Reddit threads, and product pages. What he discovered was that most gaming chairs aren’t technically waterproof—but some are water-resistant, depending on the materials used. His chair, for example, had PU leather upholstery. It turned out that PU leather can handle light spills if they’re wiped up quickly. It doesn’t absorb liquids the way fabric does, which is why his seat didn’t immediately feel soggy.

He also read a few stories from other gamers. One guy spilled an energy drink on his fabric gaming chair and said it stained instantly and left a lingering smell. Another mentioned using a waterproof seat cover after his cat had an accident on his chair. The general takeaway was: if you’ve got a fabric gaming chair, spills are a bigger deal. If it’s PU leather or PVC, you’ve got a bit of a buffer, but it’s still not truly “waterproof.”

Josh took that to heart. After his close call, he started keeping drinks further away from his chair and even picked up a cheap waterproof seat cover just to be safe. Looking back, he felt lucky his first spill was minor—and that it led him to find out more before anything worse happened.

So while gaming chairs aren’t really waterproof, some are definitely more spill-friendly than others. And as Josh would now say, “Just don’t test your chair’s limits with a whole cup of coffee.",1,1745321050.0,GameSetup,0,1.0,False

# Best Espresso Machine Overall

# Breville Barista Express

The Breville Barista Express remains the gold standard for home baristas craving café‑quality shots. At its heart, a precision conical burr grinder lets you dial in grind size and dose on demand — no pre‑ground compromise. 

The patented Razor™ dosing tool levels your puck for even extraction, while a robust 15‑bar Italian pump flirts between pressure and flavor. Heat is regulated by PID technology, ensuring water hovers at the ideal 93 °C for consistent pulls. A 2 L removable water tank with carbon filtration means every shot tastes pure. 

The stainless‑steel steam wand delivers fine microfoam for latte art, and cleanup is simplified with an accessible drip tray and wash‑cycle alerts. Though it demands about 17 × 14 × 13 in of counter space and a premium investment, its blend of customization, build quality, and speed (45 s heat‑up) makes it a perennial favourite.

**Pros**

* Integrated conical burr grinder
* Precise PID temperature control
* Razor™ dose trimming

**Cons**

* Steeper price point
* Bulky footprint
* Learning curve



# Best Versatile Espresso Machine

# De’Longhi COM532M All‑in‑One

If variety is your mantra, the De’Longhi COM532M answers the call. On one side, a 10‑cup glass carafe brews aromatic drip coffee; on the other, a professional‑style portafilter produces robust espresso shots. 

Dual‑brew capability means you can pour coffee and pull a double shot simultaneously — perfect for brunch guests. The one‑touch cappuccino system blends steam and milk for creamy froth, with options for dense or airy foam. A front‑loading water tank and drip tray streamline filling and cleaning, although overfilling can trigger minor leaks. 

While it lacks a built‑in grinder and advanced pressure profiling, its straightforward interface and dual functionality justify the countertop real estate. For mixed households or anyone who loves both drip and espresso without juggling two machines, the COM532M delivers reliably.

**Pros**

* Dual coffee & espresso
* Simultaneous brewing
* One‑touch frothing

**Cons**

* No grinder included
* Occasional drip‑tray leaks
* Limited shot customization



# Best Espresso Machine for Beginners

# Breville Bambino Plus

Beginners will appreciate the Breville Bambino Plus’s plug‑and‑play simplicity. This compact marvel heats to brew temperature in just three seconds thanks to ThermoJet™ technology. 

Although it lacks an integrated grinder, its 15 bar pump and precise temperature settings produce rich, full‑bodied shots — assuming you pair it with a quality burr grinder. The automatic steam wand senses milk temperature and texture, pausing when your microfoam peaks; switch to manual mode any time you want latte‑art control. 

At a mere 12.6 × 7.7 × 12.2 in, it fits neatly in tight kitchens. Occasional froth overflow reminds you to keep an eye on the wand, but the intuitive controls minimize trial‑and‑error. If you value speed, reliability, and a gentle learning curve, the Bambino Plus is your passport to home‑barista bliss.

**Pros**

* Fast 3 s heat‑up
* Auto steam sensing
* Compact dimensions

**Cons**

* No built‑in grinder
* Occasional overflow
* Basic feature set



# Best Small Espresso Machine

# CASABREWS CM5418

The CASABREWS CM5418 proves that great espresso doesn’t require a cavernous appliance. Its slender 8 × 6 × 12 in chassis tucks into any corner, while a one‑button brew system does the heavy lifting. 

Use the included measuring spoon and tamper to prep your puck, then press to pull a 25 s extraction at 15 bar. A separate steam‑froth button whips up creamy milk — just let the unit cool briefly before a second brew cycle. With a 1.2 L reservoir, it’s ideal for solo shots or quick two‑cup mornings. 

While it forgoes PID stability and grinder integration, its streamlined workflow and tiny footprint earn serious points for efficiency. If counter space is at a premium and you want straightforward espresso without bells and whistles, the CM5418 is your compact champion.

**Pros**

* Ultra‑compact design
* One‑touch brewing
* Included tamper & spoon

**Cons**

* Cool‑down delay
* No PID control
* Limited reservoir size



# Best Budget Espresso Machine

# Mr. Coffee Café Barista

On a tight budget? The Mr. Coffee Café Barista delivers surprising versatility for its price. Choose single or double shots on the touch panel, pause mid‑pour for custom volume, and enjoy an automatic milk frother that steams and textures without manual juggling. 

A 15 bar pump and 15 min auto shut‑off round out the energy‑saving features. It lacks both a grinder and advanced temperature control, so flavor depends on your grounds and technique. Shots can run a little weak when paired with milk, but for under $200 you’re getting cappuccino‑ready performance. 

Removable drip tray and accessible brew head simplify cleanup. For newcomers who want café‑style drinks without breaking the bank, this machine is an unbeatable entry point.

**Pros**

* Extremely affordable
* Touch‑panel simplicity
* Auto‑frothing wand

**Cons**

* No grinder integration
* Weaker milk shots
* Basic temperature control



# Conclusion

Each of these best espresso machines 2025 offers a distinct path to your perfect shot — whether you crave full customization, dual‑brew convenience, beginner‑friendly design, space‑saving simplicity, or budget‑friendly fun.

It's great to see how our sub is growing and evolving. With so many new members I'd like to remind everyone of our mission and some rules.

1. We are pro-woman, anti-kink and anti-prostitution. We do not endorse any lifestyle or ideology that is harmful to women. This includes BDSM, ENM, Polyamory, casual sex, ONS, neo-identities or neo-sexualities. Let's not make comments encouraging men to ""hire sex workers."" There is no such thing as a sex worker, only a prostituted woman/girl and no class of woman should be expected to sexually service men. Ideally I would prefer people not use the terms ""sex worker"" or ""cis"" on this sub. Both terms are regressive, sexist and homophobic and stem from ideologies harmful to women.

2. If you see an unfamiliar account or a strange sounding post please check their post history before engaging. We are frequently infiltrated by trolls, men and bad actors. Some of these are women who based on their post history seem to have serious problems and mental illnesses. Not all of these people are here in good faith. Honing our skills to discern who those people are is important. I can usually weed them out with a question or a comment, but not always. Be wary of a new account, with no history here, coming in immediately with a post meant to evoke pity and sympathy. This is typical narcissistic behavior ie. ""the pity ploy."" Train yourself how to spot it. ***Being nice and being kind are not the same thing. Be prudent sharing your energy and wisdom.***

3. Stay on topic. This sub is for posts about dating and relationships. If you would like to post more general content please do that in our sister sub r/WomenOverFortyConnect 

4. This sub is based on radical feminist principles. If you aren't sure what that means you can read a bit more about it here [https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenOverFortyConnect/comments/1ihkb94/what\_is\_a\_terf\_lets\_break\_it\_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenOverFortyConnect/comments/1ihkb94/what_is_a_terf_lets_break_it_down/)

5. This is not a debate sub and we will not debate those who don't like our stated aims and principles. There are hundreds of other subs on reddit that endorse coffee dates, kink, early sex and other things we deem harmful to women. If you don't like what we say here you can go there. This will be expressed to you through downvotes, flair assignment and banning if necessary.

I realize we are not all on the same page about everything and at many different stages of awareness when it comes to men and relationships. Some of us have been at this a lot longer than others. Please keep that in mind. The main purpose here is to help women date safely and sanely.

# Best 2025 Laptop Keyboard Covers: Protection & Style

Laptop keyboard covers are essential accessories for anyone looking to protect their investment and personalize their devices. In 2025,the market offers a wide variety of covers,ranging from ultra-thin silicone skins to more robust protectors designed to withstand spills and heavy use. Selecting the right cover is crucial to maintain the longevity and aesthetic appeal of your laptop while enhancing your typing experience.

These covers not only safeguard against dust, crumbs, and liquids but also provide a barrier against scratches and wear. For many, a keyboard cover is the cheapest form of insurance, maintaining not only the pristine look of their device, but also possibly increasing resale value.

## Key Features Analysis

The best laptop keyboard covers in 2025 boast a range of impressive features aimed at enhancing protection and user experience.

**Material Quality:** Keyboard covers are typically made from either silicone or TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane).

Silicone covers are known for their flexibility and soft touch, offering a comfortable typing experience. They tend to be thinner and more pliable, making them easy to install and remove. However, silicone can attract dust and may degrade faster then TPU.As a notable example,a high-quality silicone cover will measure approximately 0.3mm in thickness, providing a minimal profile while effectively cushioning the keys.

TPU covers, on the other hand, are more durable and resistant to wear and tear. They offer better clarity, allowing the keyboard backlight to shine through more effectively. TPU is also less prone to stretching and deformation. A premium TPU cover might feature a hardness rating of 90A,indicating excellent abrasion resistance and longevity.

**Precision Fit:** the accuracy of the cover's fit is crucial for optimal performance.

A well-designed keyboard cover will precisely match the contours of the individual keys and the surrounding keyboard area. This ensures that the cover stays securely in place and does not interfere with typing. manufacturers often use laser-cutting technology to achieve this precision, resulting in a cover that fits like a second skin.Such as, a cover designed for a specific MacBook Pro model will have cutouts that perfectly align with the speaker grilles, Touch ID sensor, and other keyboard features.

**transparency and backlight Compatibility:** Many users want to maintain the aesthetic appeal of their laptop, including the keyboard backlight.

Ideally, a keyboard cover should be highly transparent to allow the keyboard backlight to shine through clearly. High-quality TPU covers excel in this area, offering excellent clarity without distorting the light. Some covers also feature a matte finish to reduce glare and improve visibility in brightly lit environments. A cover with a light transmittance of 95% or higher will ensure that the keyboard backlight remains vibrant and easily visible.

**Anti-Slip Properties:** A keyboard cover should stay in place during typing,even with vigorous use.

Many covers feature an anti-slip coating or design to prevent them from sliding around on the keyboard. This can be achieved through the use of textured surfaces or adhesive strips. The goal is to provide a secure fit without damaging the keyboard or leaving residue behind. A cover with a friction coefficient of 0.6 or higher will offer excellent grip, preventing unwanted movement during use.

**Water and Dust Resistance:** One of the primary purposes of a keyboard cover is to protect the keyboard from spills and dust.

The best covers are designed to be completely waterproof, providing a barrier against liquids that can damage the sensitive electronics beneath the keys. They also prevent dust, crumbs, and other debris from accumulating on the keyboard.Some covers even feature a raised edge around the perimeter to contain spills and prevent them from spreading to other areas of the laptop. A cover with an IP67 rating would indicate complete protection against dust and immersion in water up to 1 meter.Key features of the best 2025 laptop keyboard covers include:

* Superior material like TPU or silicone
* Tailored fit specific to laptop model
* High transparency maintaining keyboard backlight
* Anti-slip design for stable typing
* Complete protection from spills and contaminants

## Core Benefits

Laptop keyboard covers offer several compelling benefits to users.

**Protection Against Spills and Damage:** The primary benefit of a keyboard cover is protection against spills and damage. A single accidental spill can render a laptop unusable, resulting in costly repairs or replacement. A keyboard cover provides a waterproof barrier, preventing liquids from reaching the sensitive electronics beneath the keys. This can save users hundreds or even thousands of dollars in potential repair costs. For example,someone who frequently drinks coffee or tea while working on their laptop will find a keyboard cover invaluable in preventing spill-related damage.

**Prevention of Dust and Debris Accumulation:** Keyboards are notorious for accumulating dust, crumbs, and other debris between the keys.This not only makes the keyboard look dirty but can also interfere with it's functionality. A keyboard cover prevents these particles from entering the keyboard, keeping it clean and functioning properly.This is particularly beneficial for users who work in dusty environments or frequently eat while using their laptops. A clean keyboard improves hygiene and extends the lifespan of the device.

**Enhanced Typing Comfort:** Some keyboard covers are designed to enhance typing comfort. Silicone covers, in particular, offer a soft and cushioned typing surface that can reduce finger fatigue during extended typing sessions. This can be especially beneficial for writers, programmers, and other professionals who spend hours typing each day. The added layer of cushioning can also dampen the sound of keystrokes, making the typing experience quieter and more pleasant.

**Preservation of Keyboard Aesthetics:** A keyboard cover can help preserve the aesthetic appeal of your laptop's keyboard. By protecting the keys from wear and tear, the cover prevents them from becoming shiny or faded over time. this helps maintain the keyboard's original appearance and can increase the laptop's resale value. For users who take pride in the appearance of their devices, a keyboard cover is an essential accessory.

**Customization and personalization:** Keyboard covers are available in a wide range of colors and designs, allowing users to customize and personalize their laptops. This can be a fun and easy way to add a personal touch to your device. Some covers even feature custom artwork or designs, allowing users to express their individuality. Whether you prefer a sleek and minimalist look or a bold and colorful design, there's a keyboard cover to suit your style.

In most cases,a keyboard cover will not significantly affect the laptop's cooling system. Modern laptops are designed with cooling vents located on the sides or bottom of the device,away from the keyboard area. However, if you notice your laptop running hotter than usual after installing a keyboard cover, it may be necessary to remove the cover during intensive tasks to ensure adequate airflow.

A few nights in, I couldn’t sleep, so I went out on the back porch where he used to sit with his coffee every morning. I don’t know why, but I just whispered out loud, “I miss you, Dad. I really wish you’d say something.”

There was this old wooden rail by the steps that creaked when you leaned on it, and right after I spoke, I heard it creak. Not once, but twice, slow and heavy, like someone shifting their weight. I froze. I whispered again, “Is that you?” and a second later, one of the wind chimes hanging near the porch swayed and hit just once. No breeze. Nothing else moved. I know it could be coincidence, but it felt different, like something was *there*. Has anyone else ever had something like this happen after losing someone?

I’d say it has helped regulate my hormones as my acne has cleared up, my periods have almost completely stopped (I only get them every 2 months or so but they’re still painful) my moods a lot better, no vomiting or nausea and I’m not dreading for the day my period comes. Now I haven’t gotten my period for about 3 months and I recently started working out (4 weeks ago) and during the first week I got my period. This one was really intense and painful and a lot worse than what my others were. I thought that maybe it was normal because it had been a long time since I got my period. I had my period for about a week and then it stopped. Now on my 4th week of working out my period came back and it feels even more worse than the one I had a couple of weeks ago. I thought it was weird especially because it’s intensifying and only has been since I’ve been working out so has anyone else had this issue ?

To reiterate, I am a total newbie here. 

I’m going to share my anxieties and what I have discovered about this process thus far. Perhaps the post itself and the constructive comments from members of this Community, who may be generous enough to do so that is, will serve as a reference point for others in the same situation. Fair enough? Good. Let’s GO.....

I have a large Master Bedroom in my apartment, that I am in the process of plastering, painting and refurnishing, to make it an attractive place for a boarder. My thoughts so far are leaning toward seeking a foreign exchange student.

If I (and my potential new roomie) are fortunate, I will be able to locate a tenant that pays their rent on time for 4 years, while getting their degree, never brakes anything, is logical and reasonable. I have read here on Reddit that MOST tenants are like that. As well, the thought has crossed my mind to NOT be just another schmuck looking to take someones money with a bunch of rules and make them feel that they don’t actually live here. I really do need a few kind Redditors to step up the plate here. 

Please and thank you.

There are so many (to my) mind-boggling details I have to consider here. In no particular order: I am a Man. Therefore, I will obviously be choosing a fellow Man. That decision in and of itself should address some potential future issues. I will include that in any collateral material to market the room itself with. I certainly will have to mention that I have two cats under my care. Naturally, the responsibility of their care rests squarely on my shoulders, but if someone might be allergic, they’d have to know. Not sure how I am going to handle the lesser obligations, such as leaving the cat perch installed in the Master Bedroom window where it is, for the cats, as they like to go up there. BTW, they are very friendly cats, and well behaved, I will have to caution the sublessee that from time to time they do pass up bile. As well, any such cords or thread exposed must be put away because one of the two might eat those. Think earbud wire. Anything stringy. All of which may be a deal breaker for some.

It’s little issue like that I’m concerned about. And not so little issues. Such as how does one work out how certain expenses are shared? Such as toilet paper, paper towels, cooking oil, aluminum foil? It makes no sense for us, myself and the boarder to buy such items in duplicate. 

Q: How do you folks with experience with this calculate all of this?

Q: Also, would have any ideas as to how to calculate the use of all the furniture and utensils? 

I’m looking to furnish the apartment with new or in good shape second hand furniture. I already have all the cookware, microwave, fridge, oven, kettle, coffee maker etc which are either new or in relatively good condition. I’ve seen other examples online of such rooms to rent where it looks like a bare bones situation. Like something from a gulag, talk about minimalism! I can only go so far furnishing the place, but not to THAT extent. I’ve also seen instances where in the ad the sublessor clearly states no new additional furniture. I find that to be a bit odd, but I guess they have their reasons for doing so.

Q: What would be considered reasonable questions from respondents from my ads for the room? Such as:

* Has occupation or who pays your rent?
* schedule during the week?
* what time do you get up and go to bed?
* short description of yourself?

I plan to offer a year long lease. My thinking in doing so, that, it would encourage a more serious candidate, that may also stay for a longer duration of time. I guess our interrelations will determine that I suppose. If I can even find a good candidate that is, more on that later. 

Q: Maybe I’m misguided here? you tell me.

For the final calculation price, aside from the rent of the room itself, the use of the furniture, the utensils and electricity and heating. I will NOT be including internet/wi-fi. Which be a deal breaker for some, it is what it is. I don’t want to be held liable for where someone else goes on the web. I’ve seen a few ads where internet is not included.

From what I have found so far, it is in the Additional appendix section of the Sublessor Agreement is where I would list all of these consideration, obligations, duties of the sublessee. 

Q: Is my thinking correct here?

Returning to the topic of calculating the rent charge to a sublessor, here are some points of interest I have found that I think are worth sharing at the expense of making for a lengthy post:

Shared Facilities: If the sublessee shares a kitchen/bathroom with the sublessor, they may qualify as a boarder (exempt from TAL protections), but rent rules still apply.

2. Calculation Method Base Rent Allocation Divide the total monthly rent by the number of private rooms (e.g., $1,500 for a 3-bedroom = $500/room).

Adjust for room size (e.g., master bedroom pays 40%, smaller rooms 30% each).

Additional Costs Utilities: Split equally or by occupancy (e.g., $200 monthly utilities ÷ 2 tenants = \~$100/sublessee).

Furnishings: Charge a flat fee (e.g., $50–$150/month) if providing furniture, but document actual costs.

Market Comparison Check local listings (e.g., Roomies dot ca, DuProprio):

A room in a shared apartment in Montréal average $700–$1,200/month, varying by location/amenities. Student-heavy areas (e.g., Québec City) may be lower ($500–$900).

3. Transparency & Documentation Itemize Charges: Provide a breakdown (e.g., ""$600 = $450 (rent share) + $100 utilities + $50 furniture"").

Lease Clause: Specify cost divisions in the sublease agreement to avoid disputes.

Example: Total rent: $1,200 (2-bedroom) Sublessee’s share: $600 (50% rent) + $80 utilities = $680/month.

4. Penalties & Risks Overcharging: If the sublessee complains to the TAL, the sublessor may owe refunds for excess charges.

Another factoid to add here. The sublessee will have access to the Master Bedroom, small kitchen with a small kitchen table and of course the washroom. The small bedroom and the front-room are totally occupied by myself. In a sense there really isn’t a dedicated common shared space.

Moving on to other duties/obligations I’d include: assistance taking part with the installation of the Air Conditioners. I imagine that is another circumstance I would have to bring up in the interview process (?) My Mother and I did certainly use AC here. Otherwise her and I (and the cats) would MELT. Someone who doesn’t like AC, would not like living here, to be sure. Q: Any feedback as to how I should approach all of this? Asks the newbie.

Other details cont’d:  Assistance in cleaning the windows together. It’s a two person job, just to remove the windows themselves to get to the windowsills to clean them. If they refuse to follow through, at least twice over a given year, then I’d have to pay a cleaning company to do it. Q: What would I do then? Q: How should I approach all of this?

Other details further still: It’s issues like the following that make me think to ixnay the entire endeavor....what about guests/ friends/ girlfriends. 

Q: Can I put in the attached appendix that no such overnight guests at the least will be tolerated? 

Or how to even approach this aspect? 

I mean, it’s just my stuff laying around the place. I’ve been making efforts to put anything remotely valuable away somewhere. Even so ,I don’t want to find anything has mysteriously vanished. What am I supposed to do, lock up my computer gear every night in locked cabinet? C’mon. I wouldn’t do the same to my new roomie/ boarder/ sublessee. Wit hthe cast and the way the palce is laid out, it doesnlt make sense to put a lock on my bedroom door.

I also found some useful links concerning communications and resolving issues that I’d like to share:

[https://www.squareone.ca/resource-centres/renter/solving-common-roommate-issues](https://www.squareone.ca/resource-centres/renter/solving-common-roommate-issues)

[https://www.squareone.ca/resource-centres/renter/choosing-a-college-roommate-the-6-step-guide](https://www.squareone.ca/resource-centres/renter/choosing-a-college-roommate-the-6-step-guide)

I am quite aware, keeping up good lines of communication with my now roommate/boarder/sublessee is good practice. Q: Any guidance on how to achieve this?

I don’t have a large social circle nor family from which I can ask if they know someone who would like to live here with me. Q: For folks with experience, what strategies do you use to suss out who may be a good sublessee as a person?  I guess personal experience plays a huge role here.

I was thinking of going directly to some of the local student associations with my ads. Sell myself, as well as the room/apartment itself. For example  various Christian Student associations. 

Q: What do you think of that strategy, any other suggestions?

Q: What does one use for background checks? I have read on reddit that I should only consider a 750 or better score.

If what I have to offer garners little to no interest, its a win-win for the time being. I’ll have a nice newly refreshed Master Bedroom. Some may wonder why don’t I just move to a smaller apartment myself? I can, and I might. Although I’d like to hold onto this place since I’ve been here for such a long time. As well, its not lost on me that this entire process is going to take TIME.

Let’s get one thing straight right out of the gate. If you came here looking for answers, you’ve taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque (or Augusta). This isn’t one of those tidy how-to guides where I give you five easy steps to cosmic clarity and inner peace. Nope. This is more like a survival manual for people who are pretty good at nodding, occasionally raise an eyebrow for effect, and somehow still get invited to meetings they don’t remember signing up for.

Truth is, most of us are just making it up as we go and pretending we meant to.

And guess what? That’s the art.

See, I’ve spent a lot of time around smart people. Engineers. Inspectors. Consultants. Grandkids. And they all have one thing in common. None of them actually know what’s going on all the time. The good ones? They’ve just mastered the poker face. They’ve got the “hmm, yes, fascinating” look down cold. They’ve learned to walk into chaos with the confidence of someone who’s either got a plan or is really good at pretending they do.

This blog? It’s for the rest of us.

Here’s what you’ll find in Grumpy’s Guide:

* How to survive corporate buzzword storms without losing your will to live
* Tips for nodding wisely while your brain is buffering
* What to do when someone says “quantum mechanics” and you’ve only just figured out Bluetooth
* And why sometimes the best response to life’s chaos is a half-smile and a strategic sip of coffee

Let me be clear. I don’t have it all figured out. I’ve just gotten comfortable in the not-knowing. I wear flannel, I carry a thermal camera, and I pretend to understand things like supply chains and how to fix the Wi-Fi. It’s all part of the game.

So if you’re out there faking it with the best of them, welcome. You’re in good company. This blog is for anyone who’s ever walked into a room, forgotten why they were there, and still left with a handshake and a free muffin.

I absolutely LOVE coffee and used to drink multiple cups a day religiously with no ill effects. A couple of years ago I got a really bad stomach bug which made my stomach so sensitive to anything I’d eat or drink. Coffee kept making me feel sick so I stopped drinking it for just over a year.

About a year ago I started drinking coffee again as I’ve really missed it but it makes me so ill every time I drink it now. It makes me super bloated, nauseous, diarrhoea and acid reflux. It doesn’t matter whether I drink it black, white or with a lot of milk (latte), I always end up really ill. Even instant coffee has the same effect. I have since done a food intolerance test and coffee came back with a ‘high reaction’ I’m not sure if this is a new thing or I just had a tolerance previously.

Is there anything I can do to re-build a tolerance? I love coffee so much and I have a very expensive sage espresso machine sat gathering dust in my kitchen 😞

The morning light streamed through the large windows of Sofia’s favorite café as she sat with her closest friends, stirring her cappuccino absentmindedly. She should have been focused on the medical journal open in front of her, but her mind kept drifting back to him.

Jack Romano.

His name was infamous in their world—spoken with both respect and fear. Yet, instead of intimidation, their brief interaction last night had left Sofia with nothing but frustration. She despised men like him—calculating, arrogant, convinced they could own anything they desired.

“I saw you talking to Jack Romano last night.” Her friend Isabella’s voice pulled her back to the present.

Sofia’s hand tensed around her spoon. “It wasn’t a conversation. More like a few words exchanged.”

“Well, it was enough to get people talking,” Isabella teased, leaning in. “Word is, he couldn’t take his eyes off you.”

Sofia scoffed. “Then he needs to get his eyes checked.”

Another friend, Daniela, wasn’t as amused. “You should be careful, Sofia. His family may not be at war with yours, but they aren’t exactly allies either. You don’t want to get tangled up with someone like him.”

“I have no intention of ever speaking to him again,” Sofia assured them. “Jack Romano is nothing but trouble.”

Yet, even as she said it, she couldn’t shake the feeling that trouble had already found her.

Jack watched from across the room as Sofia laughed with her friends. He had arranged this encounter, though she didn’t know it. Ever since the wedding, she had occupied his thoughts—a rare occurrence for a man like him.

He had women at his beck and call, alliances built on power and necessity. But Sofia? She was different. She didn’t care for his reputation, and that intrigued him more than he cared to admit.

His right-hand man, Marco, smirked. “You’ve been staring at her for a while now. I think you’ve scared the waiter.”

Jack took a sip of his espresso, eyes never leaving her. “She’s interesting.”

Marco raised an eyebrow. “She’s Moretti’s niece. That makes her a complication.”

Jack chuckled. “I like complications.”

At that moment, Sofia’s gaze flickered toward him, her body going rigid when she recognized him. He expected her to look away, to ignore him. Instead, she held his gaze—defiant, unwavering.

Jack smirked. Game on.


Sofia had had enough. She didn’t believe in coincidences, and Jack showing up at the same café felt far too deliberate. With an exasperated sigh, she stood and made her way over to his table, her heels clicking against the tile floor.

Jack looked up, amused, as she crossed her arms. “Following me now, Mr. Romano?”

He leaned back in his chair, exuding nothing but confidence. “Would you believe me if I said I just enjoy good coffee?”

Sofia narrowed her eyes. “Not for a second.”

Jack chuckled, motioning to the empty seat across from him. “Sit.”

“No.”

His smirk deepened. “Afraid?”

Sofia scoffed. “Of you? Hardly.”

Jack tilted his head, studying her. “Good. Because I don’t bite.” He leaned forward slightly, his voice lowering. “Unless you ask nicely.”

Heat rose to Sofia’s cheeks, but she refused to give him the satisfaction of seeing her flustered. “You’re wasting your time. I have no interest in whatever game you’re playing.”

Jack regarded her with a lazy amusement. “Who says it’s a game?”

“It’s always a game with men like you.” She stepped back, lifting her chin. “And I don’t play.”

Jack watched as she turned and walked away, a smirk playing on his lips. She might not play games, but he wasn’t one to lose.

1k535d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLABprep/comments/1k535d4/if_you_still_decide_to_take_the_plab_practical/,If you still decide to take the PLAB - Practical tips,"Hi all, 

I wrote a lengthy post yesterday on why not to sit for the PLAB exam. I know I might have broken a lot of hearts (and dreams), but let me reiterate, none of you are my enemies. I probably don't know any of you, and most of you are likely my junior colleagues professionally. My aim wasn't to discourage you but to serve you the truth, which isn't always sweet.

However, if you still decide to go ahead, I will share these practical tips. This has mostly got nothing to do with your exam preparation, but will help you with the nuances of the life of a UK junior medic.

1. **PLAB 1 Preparation**: You guys probably know how to prepare better than I do, so I'll skip it. But I suggest keeping the Oxford Handbook handy. Plabable is a good resource, and I've seen the questions that look somewhat similar to the actual exam questions.
2. **PLAB 2 Preparation**: Definitely join a course. Remember, PLAB 2 is essentially an exam to test your clinical skills, but in reality, it tests how ""British"" a doctor you are. Communication skills are a must. Common pitfalls for IMGs are the sexual questions, which can be very uncomfortable. The examiners love to see the discomfort on your face. I do not recommend online courses. If it's affordable, do the face-to-face courses.
3. **GMC Registration**: It can be a bit of a pain, and it’s extremely unpredictable. Some get it in weeks, and for some it can take up to 6 months. But you will get it. Ensure you have all your mark sheets, Attempt certificate, Degree certificate, Hours certificate, Internship completion, Medium of instruction certificate, Certificate of good standing from your home medical council.
4. **Apply for Clinical Attachments**: (I strongly discourage applying for a job directly; you're not likely to get one). Try Queens Hospital in Romford (Google BHR hospitals), West Middlesex Hospital, Princess Royal University Hospital, Medway Maritime Hospital, Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, and Milton Keynes University Hospital. I am sure there are a lot more, but these have a good response rate. You won't learn much during the attachment, but it'll give you contacts, which can slightly help you with a job. (Make sure you buy a coffee for the rota manager.)
5. **Apply to Every Possible Job**: Use NHS Jobs or Trac Jobs. Sign up with all the agencies you can find online and register for permanent jobs. It is unlikely you'll get a job in London, or any tier 1 city, but even if you get a job in the middle of nowhere—grab it. Feel free to resign after 6 months. Once you have at least 6 months to a year of NHS experience, it opens up a whole new world. Saying that, it might take you up to a year to secure an interview. Do not give up. You will probably not be allowed to stay in the UK for more than 6 months at a time, but most hospitals allow online interviews.Also, you may be an orthopod back home, but if you get an A&E job, take it. I've seen a dermatology consultant (and a very good one) from Pakistan take up an A&E SHO (Junior Clinical Fellow). So for the first job—take what you get.
6. **Get Your Skilled Worker Visa**.
7. **Set Up Your National Insurance Number with HMRC**.
8. **Register with a GP**.
9. **Housing**: If you have someone to host you, that makes your life easier. Else, look into websites like Gumtree or Spareroom for a single room in a house share. It is likely going to cost you between £100 to £500 a month outside London, and £550 to £1200 in London. My biggest advice would be not to live in London for at least 3 years. You will not save any money. Sorry guys, I hosted a few IMGs back in the day, but now I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, and a cat, so my hotel is closed till further notice!! Another practical problem is, a lot of English houses do not want you to cook curries or anything that smells, so if possible, try to house share with another fellow Asian or eat outside or start eating English! LOL. (And do not worry, Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis do not fight each other here; they are the ones who usually have your back.)
10. **Grocery is Expensive Here**: It could easily cost you £200 a month. If you smoke or drink, add another £200. Also keep in mind, inflation is massive in the UK and it hits harder every year. For the fist 1-2 years, saving money is pretty unlikely. 
11. **Transport Is Not Cheap As Well**: In London, it will cost you roughly £5.60 per day of travel. Not sure what it's like outside London.
12. **Get a Mobile Phone on a Contract**: Try EE or Vodafone, but avoid O2. Having a contract helps build your credit score, which is essential for many things in the UK. Initially, banks may not offer you a credit card when you open your account. The easiest way to start is with a mobile contract. Unlike in the U.S., where a very low credit score might still get you things at higher interest rates, in the UK, you might be outright rejected. If you manage to get a credit card, it likely won't have more than a £500 credit limit. Use no more than 25% of it and pay it off in full every month.
13. **Keep Upskilling Yourself:** While handling all this, continue gaining skills. Do courses like ALS (not ACLS, it has no value in the UK), ePALS, and ATLS. Any certificate course is a great option and start looking into qualifications like MRCS, MRCP, etc.
14. **Adjusting to Social Life**: When you start your first job, you may find yourself a bit lonely. People might talk behind your back. It can be annoying, demeaning, and condescending. However, the best approach is not to fight back aggressively. Do not get confrontational. If you face a racist joke, address it firmly but professionally without physical altercation. If it's genuinely funny, join in the laughter. Learning to laugh at yourself is important in the UK since people here often use humor to connect, including making light of themselves. Historically, many Asians have taken offensive comments silently, (Now you ask why there is no such thing as Brown Lives Matter??) but standing up confidently and professionally can quickly turn hostility into respect and apologies . It is not easy to break into the British friend circle, but once you do, they can be extremely genuine or sincere. 

I hope this helps. If any of you have specific questions, feel free to ask. And most importantly—good luck!",7,1745318415.0,PLABprep,4,0.89,False

A man (24-26 y/o at max) boarded from the Jangpura stn and stood at a distance....... 

We both got off of the metro at Central secretariat (assuming we both had to switch to the yellow line) I didn't think much.... That was until he ran towards the same door I was standing in front of and boarded the metro along w me. He sat 2 seats away from me (that coach was not crowded at all) and then he came and sat right next to me and asked if I'm some divya who attended the upsc coaching in 2021etc? 
I just laughed and replied ""do I look that old?"" (I had just turned 18, and no way in hell I looked 20+😭😭😭) 

The he initiated a random conversation about his family's business, property, asked me about my plans, relationship , boyfriend, and what not, I kept on nodding my head, cuz I couldn't just run away or ask him to shut up cuz I've seen things get worse when ppl intervene during such moments especially w strangers.



I kept on telling him that I'm going to meet my friend (male) was trying to call him , while he was happily sleeping in his form and I tried it from multiple platforms (including discord, WhatsApp, Instagram etc).... That was a funny mistake tbh lol cuz then he asked for my id and even when I said that it's just a spam account w no posts (main account hi tha, i just don't post) he still insisted so I added him. 

The first thing I saw on his ID was his SHAADI KI PHOTOOOOOOOOO

I was speechless!!!!!!!!!!! 

I ain't lying, his wife was WAYYYYYYYY out of his league and pretty asf!!!!! I was just surprised to see that he was talking to me (definitely not w good intentions) .....
He then started praising his wife, and said that she's very kind, they had an arranged marriage, she handled his family business too when he's not there, she's very responsible and he is lucky . This made me happy, to see him appreciate the only woman meant for him in this life now, but the he asked me for a coffee and mentioned that it's fine to have coffee as friends, even w a stranger. I said declined his offer around 4ish times and then he said ""chalo mai jaata hu, waisay mujhe civil lines pe utarna tha"" (the metro had reached Azadpur) .

And the minute the metro left that station, I blocked him, and told the incident to my friend. 

This incident genuinely creeped me out and now I fear being w a man whom I consider my everything but he turns out like him.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Danish Superliga, where the drama is as rich as the pastries and the rivalries are as fierce as a Viking raid. Let's dive into the upcoming clash between FC Midtjylland and FC Nordsjælland, a match that promises to be as unpredictable as a Danish weather forecast.

FC Midtjylland is currently sitting pretty in second place, just a point behind the leaders, FC København. They're like that kid in school who's always one mark away from an A+ and just can't seem to catch a break. Their upcoming match against FC Nordsjælland is crucial, as a win could catapult them to the top of the table, assuming FCK doesn't pull off another victory.

Now, FC Nordsjælland might not be the league's powerhouse, but they're the kind of team that can surprise you when you least expect it—like finding a Lego piece underfoot in the middle of the night. Midtjylland hasn't beaten them on the road since July 2020, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee.

The odds are tighter than a pair of skinny jeans after a Danish buffet. According to BetRivers, both teams are priced at 2.5 to win, with a draw at 3.85. This suggests that the bookmakers are as indecisive as a cat choosing between two equally appealing sunspots.

For those looking to place a bet, the ""Over 3.0 goals"" market at LowVig.ag is priced at 1.77. Given the attacking prowess of both teams and Midtjylland's desperation to leapfrog FCK, this could be a goal-fest worthy of a highlight reel. So, if you're feeling lucky, or just want to spice up your Tuesday, that's your best bet.

In conclusion, expect a match filled with drama, goals, and possibly a few heart-stopping moments. Whether Midtjylland can finally break their away curse against Nordsjælland is anyone's guess, but one thing's for sure: it's going to be a cracker of a match. Grab your popcorn, or in this case, your Danish pastries, and enjoy the show!

A cold, icy voice cut through the silence. ""Isis, you've been wearing the title of my wife for way too long. It's time you hand it back to Layla Wilson.""

Isis Moore couldn't believe her ears. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined her husband would be the one to take her life.

Her stomach twisted in pain, while Adrian Anderson held Layla Wilson in his arms, her eyes gleaming with smug satisfaction.

""Isis, don't worry. I'll take good care of Adrian from now on,"" Layla said, her voice dripping with condescension.

Isis stared at them in utter disbelief, her voice shaking. ""You... you... how could you do this?""

She knew Layla—Adrian's coworker, his college classmate. But she'd never imagined they'd end up together like this. Never thought they'd betray her so brutally.

Adrian just snorted, his voice cold and detached. ""Let me put it bluntly. Layla's my first love. I've always loved her, not you.""

The truth hit her like a punch to the gut. Blood rushed to her mouth, dark and thick, spilling out in a violent cough.

Her eyes went wide with disbelief. ""If you loved her, why the hell did you even marry me?""

She remembered it all—how Adrian had chased her, how he'd convinced her to be with him. She'd given him everything—her heart, her trust, all of herself.

Even though his family wasn't well-off, she never complained. She admired his drive, his ambition—but now, she realized it was never for her.

She'd always tried to take care of him, never once spending his money. She'd handled everything for their home, from renovations to furniture. It was all her effort, her blood, sweat, and tears.

Adrian had even brought his parents and sister to live with them, and she never said a word about it. She'd treated them like her own family—better than a full-time nanny.

When Adrian had said, ""I want you to stay home and take care of everything while I work,"" she gave up her career in a heartbeat, putting everything into caring for their family.

And now? Now she was getting his cold, heartless words. ""I've always loved her, not you."" It felt like a slap in the face.

Adrian looked at her with nothing but disgust, like she was dirt beneath his shoes. He didn't even bother to answer.

Layla, on the other hand, opened her mouth, practically gloating, as though she'd won some twisted prize.

She said, ""Don't play the victim. You're the one who ruined everything. You made sure I saw you with Adrian, which is why I left the country in a fit. If you hadn't done that, you wouldn't even be in the picture.""

Layla was practically foaming at the mouth with anger, but Isis was completely lost.

'When did I ever set up something like that?' she thought. Back when she was with Adrian, he was always alone—there was never anyone else.

Isis opened her mouth to defend herself, but the moment she did, a violent coughing fit overtook her, blood spilling from her lips. She glanced at Adrian, but he didn't even flinch. He was completely siding with Layla.

In that moment, everything clicked. There were no reasons. They just needed a convenient excuse to justify their betrayal.

""Adrian...Why..."" Isis's eyes widened in shock, struggling to hold back the excruciating pain as she demanded, ""Why the hell are you doing this to me?

""Even if you love her, even if you want to marry her... I gave up everything for you—why the hell would you want me dead?""

Adrian's eyes turned dark, filled with pure malice. He leaned in close to her ear, his voice cold and venomous. ""You're such an idiot. If you don't die, how am I supposed to get my hands on the Moore family fortune?""

Isis felt like the world had just come crashing down on her. So, all this time, his pursuit, his proposal, it was all about her family's money.

'How fucking pathetic...' Isis let out a bitter laugh, blood staining her lips. 'I thought this was love... real love...'

Adrian's eyes gleamed with cold fury. ""This is all your fault, Isis. Don't blame anyone else. If you had just handed over the inheritance, we wouldn't be here.""

His voice was devoid of emotion—no affection, no warmth—just pure, heartless calculation.

Layla stood next to him, her arms crossed and a cruel sneer on her face. ""Adrian, stop wasting time with this bitch. Just shove the poison down her throat already—we've got a prenatal checkup to get to.""

Isis's heart slammed in her chest. 'Prenatal checkup? They... they are already having a kid?'

Layla's hand rested smugly on her flat stomach, a look of pure satisfaction in her eyes.

Isis could barely process it—her whole world was falling apart. But there was no time for that now. Adrian grabbed her face and shoved the last dose of poison into her mouth, eyes burning with hatred.

As soon as the poison hit, a wave of pain ripped through her insides. It felt like her organs were being torn apart. The agony was unbearable.

She couldn't speak anymore. Couldn't even move. All she could do was endure, feel her life slipping away, bit by bit.

Regret swallowed her whole. She had given everything for him—sacrificed her family, her dignity, her freedom—and in return, she got... nothing.

It wasn't worth a damn thing.

As darkness overtook her, she closed her eyes. If she ever got another shot at life, she'd never fall for Adrian's lies again.

Then, a flash of white light exploded before her eyes.

And suddenly—BANG! BANG! BANG! Urgent pounding on the door echoed in her ears.

""Isis! Open the door!""

# 2.Chapter 2 Let's Get A Divorce

Isis jolted awake, her heart pounding. 'Wait... didn't I already die?'

But when she opened her eyes, everything around her—the same old wedding bedroom she shared with Adrian—was exactly the way it had been.

She was completely thrown off, wondering if she was still stuck in some kind of dream.

But then, the sound of someone banging on the door snapped her back to reality. ""Isis! Come on, open the door!"" The voice was so sharp and real, it cut through her confusion.

She pinched herself hard, and the sharp sting was all the proof she needed. This wasn't a dream.

Her eyes darted to the clock on the wall, and the date hit her like a ton of bricks. It was the fifth day since she married Adrian.

'Wait... did I just time travel?' The thought smacked her upside the head. She jumped out of bed and rushed to the door.

Standing outside was Adrian's little sister, Alice Anderson, looking pissed as hell. ""What the hell took you so long? I need my tuition money, like, now.""

Isis smirked coldly. Of course, everything was just as she remembered.

It was the fifth day after her marriage to Adrian. It seemed like fate was cutting her some slack. She hadn't gone back before marrying him, but it was better late than never.

This time, she wasn't going to let the Anderson family walk all over her.

Isis looked Alice up and down, her expression hardening. She'd treated Alice like a real sister once, but what had Alice done? Used her like an ATM.

With ice in her voice, Isis shot back, ""Not a chance."" Then, without another word, she slammed the door in Alice's face.

On the other side, Alice was frozen in shock. 'Did I just hear that right? Isis actually said she's not paying my tuition? Has she completely lost it?'

Fuming, Alice stomped downstairs and barged into the living room where her mom, Zoe Anderson, was sipping her coffee like nothing was wrong. ""Mom, Isis won't pay my tuition.""

Zoe let out a scoffing laugh. ""No way. She's always been the one to give in to us. There's no way she's saying no now.""

Alice's confusion was evident. ""I'm telling you, she really said no.""

""Mom, do you think... maybe Isis finally got what she wanted—married my brother—and now she's changed? Was everything she did for us just an act?"" Alice's voice wavered with doubt.

Zoe put her coffee cup down, raising an eyebrow. ""I seriously doubt it. She's been obsessed with your brother from the start.

""Hell, she bought this whole place with her own money and only put your brother's name on the deed. No way she was faking that.""

Alice immediately saw the point. ""So she still dared to pull that crap with me? Hell no! I'm going to give her a piece of my mind!""

Isis had always been the calm, collected type, never one to lose her temper. But the icy, indifferent way she'd acted earlier really threw Alice for a loop. For a moment, Alice forgot to argue altogether.

Zoe quickly intervened. ""Forget it, let's just wait for your brother to get back. He'll know how to handle her—teach Isis a lesson she won't forget.""

Zoe had her own plans. Alice's tuition needed to be paid, not to mention Grandma Naomi Anderson's VIP hospital bills. Zoe couldn't afford to go to war with Isis just yet.

And, to top it all off, the Anderson family's business was at a critical stage. Both William and Adrian Anderson had mentioned needing a huge cash injection, fast.

All of that depended on Isis Moore. Zoe knew that if they were going to get anything from her, it was going to have to be through Adrian.

\*\*\*\*\*

Isis closed the door behind her and sat down, trying to process the whirlwind of events that had just unfolded.

Before everything went sideways, she'd only been married to Adrian for three months when he tried to poison her. But even before that, she'd been slowly poisoned for a while. Maybe even set up in this life.

But she wasn't sweating it. The poison wasn't fatal unless triggered by another substance, and even though she was already poisoned, she wasn't in any real danger.

What mattered now was getting a divorce from Adrian and getting back everything she'd sacrificed for the Anderson family.

Later that night, when Adrian came home and heard about everything, he immediately flew off the handle. ""Isis! What the hell is wrong with you?!""

He kicked open her door. ""Why didn't you pay Alice's tuition?!""

Isis gave him a cold, dead-eyed look, trying to suppress the boiling anger inside. ""Because I don't want to.""

Adrian froze, blinking. 'What? What the hell? Isis, what kind of attitude is that? Has she completely lost it?'

Realizing he still needed money from her, Adrian sneered, ""Look, I'm giving you one chance. Go apologize to Alice, pay her tuition and Grandma's hospital fees, and I'll let it slide.""

Isis couldn't hold back her laughter. She didn't even blink. ""Not happening. I don't need you to let it slide.""

Adrian lost it. He pointed at her, practically spitting with rage. ""Isis! Don't think just because we're married, everything's smooth sailing! You should know, we can always get a divorce!""

Isis just nodded, not missing a beat. ""Fine. Let's get divorced then.""

Adrian's jaw dropped. He stared at her, shocked. There was no way she was serious. She had to be out of her mind.

""You're really crazy,"" he spat, and turned to walk out.

It wasn't that he didn't want the divorce—it was just that the timing wasn't right yet.

Isis laughed bitterly to herself as she watched him leave. What a coward. He couldn't even say the word ""divorce"" himself.

Just then, Sophie Perry, the housekeeper, walked in slowly, her face full of concern. ""Mrs. Anderson, are you alright?""

""I'm fine, Sophie. I'm getting a divorce,"" Isis said flatly, but with a steely resolve.

Sophie blinked, stunned. ""Are you... sure? Did something happen?""

Anyone else might not have understood, but Sophie, who had been with Isis since she was little, knew how deeply Isis had loved Adrian.

Since they'd started dating, Isis had been completely devoted to him. When they decided to get married, Adrian had moved his entire family in, and Isis had treated them like her own, taking care of them without question.

The Anderson family's business had been struggling until Isis stepped in, using her resources to help the company skyrocket.

Once Zoe Anderson moved into the villa and the company took off, she started living like a high-society lady—demanding only the best. She even spent money like it was nothing just to fit in with the elite wives of Sans City.

Alice, on the other hand, had always been about luxury and status. She could've gone to a public school, but insisted on going to an expensive private one. She'd constantly begged Isis for favors.

Because they were family, Isis had agreed. But after that, the Andersons never brought up Alice's tuition again, leaving Isis to foot the bill.

And let's not forget Adrian's grandma Naomi Anderson, who practically lived in the VIP ward of the hospital. Isis was the one paying for her treatment, while the Andersons couldn't care less.

Isis had given so much for Adrian. They'd finally gotten married. But now, just five days into the marriage, she was already talking about divorce.

Sophie couldn't believe it.

A bitter, self-mocking smile spread across Isis's face as she looked up at Sophie. Her eyes were hard with determination. ""Sophie, I've made up my mind. I'm divorcing him.""

Sophie was the housekeeper who'd raised Isis like a daughter. So after Isis was killed by the Andersons in her past life, Sophie wasn't having it.

She threw a fit, demanding they do an autopsy to prove the truth, but the Andersons just sold her out—shipped her off to some remote, godforsaken mountain where she was tortured for god knows how long until it broke her and drove her insane.

Just thinking about it made Isis's eyes sting with tears. Because of her own damn mistakes, Sophie had to suffer too. This time around, she swore she would protect Sophie—no matter what.

# 3.Chapter 3 Why Should I Cook?

When the Anderson family found out that Adrian hadn't just failed to patch things up with Isis but had come back empty-handed—and, to make matters worse, she'd actually asked for a divorce—everyone was completely stunned.

Zoe rushed over to her son. ""No way you can divorce her, Adrian! We haven't even gotten all the perks from the Moore family yet! Don't be a fool.""

William nodded, agreeing with his wife. ""Exactly. Our company's barely scraping by. We've got to keep Isis in check. No two ways about it.""

Adrian, already frustrated beyond belief, muttered, ""She actually asked for a divorce? If I go along with that, I'll look like a complete idiot. Does she seriously think I can't live without her?""

Truth was, he had never really been all that into her.

If Layla hadn't gone abroad when she did, leaving him heartbroken, he wouldn't have given Isis a second thought. But Isis came into his life, cared for him in ways no one else did, and he ended up marrying her.

But later Layla was back in town, just when he was about to tie the knot with Isis, it felt like everything was a mess. He regretted how things had played out.

There had been moments when he seriously thought about asking for a divorce. But the perks Isis brought to the table—they were way too important to throw away.

His whole family was dead set against him ending things, and he couldn't afford to risk that.

At least, not yet.

So he buried his feelings for Layla deep down and decided to stick with Isis.

'But now, after all that, for Isis to pull this crap right after we got married? What the hell?' Adrian thought. He stormed out of the room, seething with anger.

For three years prior to the end of last September, it's a drink that you'd bring to me, back to our bed.  You'd sip yours and in the beginning we'd start out laughing, joking, and talking about the day ahead.  By the near-end of our relationship, you'd finish yours quickly and then out the door you'd vanish.  I would be half finished mine, and ease into the day.  
By the ending of our relationship, you had stopped bringing me coffee in bed.  You had stopped making me coffee.  You had stopped making coffee, and you had stopped talking to me.  We were ghosts in the same realm, the same house that housed two bodies that didn't touch.  
Every time I drink coffee now, I think of you.  I think of you most every time anyway.

You wanted to better yourself, and you started with what you always called your shell.  You told me that you're a shell of a human being.  Your shell has gotten bigger, bulkier, and the muscle tone of it is surprising because I was not aware that shells had muscles.  
Your insides still seem to struggle with this life and all it tosses around.  Your heart still seems at a loss of how to feel.  Your mind still seems like it's supported by a car with no shocks, or a rubber band.  You do seem happier though, and you tell me that's because I'm out of your life.

After you told me that you hate me, you got the spark back in your beautiful eyes.  After you screamed at me, and told me in detail how much I have deteriorated over the course of our relationship, and after you unintentionally taught me how loathing can be measured by volume, you seemed to breathe easier.

Your anger, and how you managed to turn it outward and shove it down deep inside of my brain until it reached my heart makes me question any love that you told me you had for me.  
I really believed that you were teaching me about love.  
You did teach me, but I'm doubtful that it has anything to do with love from another person.

Maybe you just taught me that I need to make my own coffee.  
Maybe I'll stop drinking this stupid shit so that I can breathe easier too.  So that my eyes become sparkly again.  
So that my shell can soften once more.  
So that I can feel happy again.  
So that I can finally forget you.",1,1745317701.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

1k52vif,https://www.reddit.com/r/MounjaroMaintenance/comments/1k52vif/maintenance_mistake/,Maintenance Mistake,"Well I posted a couple of months ago after reaching goal on 7.5 and moved down to 5mg. I immediately put 3lbs on but felt no hunger or major food noise so even though I was panicking at the speedy weight increase, thought I'd continue. After a week of just keeping to plan it came back off and I settled at 11st 5lbs to 11st 7lbs. I'm 50F and 5ft 11. So never been this low weight before and I like it!  So had my Oushk chat and said I was looking to reduce but ultimately come off it. And they said they'd support whatever I chose. So last month decided to try going to 2.5mg. Made the mistake of waiting till payday and earliest delivery day I wasn't available so had been past jab day by 5days. Not a major problem until the voice inside me said, let's not take it and see how you go. Keep the 2.5 for ""just in case""
So didn't take it. Week one off it was fine. Week 2 I was hungry. And not pecking, but staaarving. But ignored it and drank more water /coffee. Week 3 was when the food noise starting badly. And I was struggling. 9mths of great habits and I felt I was on a serious diet, hungry, craving and even though not doing too bad food wise my weight went up to 11st 9.2lbs. So Saturday I had enough and took the jab. Hallelujah!! The food noise has quietened. I'm not that hungry, bit peckish from time to time. But the relief! Weight today was 11st 6.8lbs. If I can stay on 2.5 and just keep mindful eating that would be great. If not I know I can maintain happily on 5mg. But now I know and remember how hard it was to not put on weight, even doing all the right things. ",14,1745317334.0,MounjaroMaintenance,1,1.0,False
