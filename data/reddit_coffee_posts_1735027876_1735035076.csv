I wrote here a short ""HOW-TO"", please let me know if something is not clear, because my all point is to share my knowledge with you all.  
  
lets start:   
**1. Discard Coffee Grounds**  
Open the lid and remove and discard the grounds and filter.

**2. Clean the Carafe**  
Wash the glass carafe and lid in a sink of warm, soapy water or place them on the upper rack of a dishwasher. Rinse well and dry with a lint-free microfiber cloth.  
*--- end of daily clean ---*  
**3. Start a deeper cleaning procces (vinegar ..soap ...DO NOT DO IT EVERY DAY!)**  
Unplug the unit before removing components, lift the coffeemaker lid, and remove and discard the paper filter and ground coffee. And wash the filter basket in warm, soapy water or place it on the upper rack of the dishwasher. Rinse the basket well and dry it with a lint-free microfiber cloth.  
**4.** **Wipe the area under the brew basket** with a damp microfiber cloth to capture loose coffee grounds. Wash the carafe and lid in warm, soapy water or place on the upper rack of a dishwasher. Do not use harsh scouring powders or scrubbing brushes in the carafe that can cause scratches.  
**5. Rinse well and dry with a microfiber cloth.**  
**6. Removing Coffee Stains From a Cuisinart Coffee Maker - NOT A MUST.**  
If you have stains remaining in your carafe, fill the carafe half-full with hot water and half-full with distilled **white vinegar**. Allow the solution to soak in the carafe for at least 30 minutes (overnight is fine) and then wash in warm, soapy water. Use a bottle brush to help reach all of the interior surfaces. Or, fill the carafe with hot water and add a denture-cleaning tablet. Soak for at least 30 minutes and wash well in warm, soapy water.  


total cost of the deep cleaning about 3.95$ **- a win!**

The barista just handed me my oat milk latte (extra shot, of course), and I’m staring at my laptop, watching Google’s search results do their thing. It’s mesmerizing, really, like watching waves crash at the beach… but for nerds like me, who obsess over SEO.

I’ve been a digital marketer for years, but cracking the [local SEO game in Austin](https://rabbitrank.com/why-i-think-rabbit-rank-is-the-best-seo-agency-in-austin/)? That’s a different beast entirely. If you’re reading this, I’m guessing you’re either trying to rank your business or you’re just mildly curious about what makes this city tick in terms of search rankings. Either way, buckle up—I’m spilling all the secrets today.

# Why Austin’s Local SEO is a Whole Vibe

First, let’s talk about Austin. It’s not just the live music capital of the world or the home of breakfast tacos that make you believe in miracles. It’s a fast-growing tech hub with people who are as serious about their craft beer as they are about supporting local businesses. This means competition is fierce. If you’re a business owner, you’re not just competing with the guy across the street—you’re up against an army of ambitious entrepreneurs who probably know what a meta description is.

The kicker? Austin folks *love* local. Whether it’s a boutique selling handcrafted cowboy boots or a food truck doling out vegan BBQ (yes, that’s a thing here), people want authentic, Austin-born businesses. But Google isn’t a mind reader. It’s up to you to make sure your biz shows up when locals start typing, “Best tacos near me” or “Top yoga studios in Austin.”

# Step 1: Google My Business (aka Your Bestie)

Let me start with a confession: I used to underestimate [Google My Business](https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-my-business/) (GMB). I mean, it’s just a free profile—how much weight could it actually carry? Oh boy, was I wrong. If you don’t have a killer GMB setup, you’re basically playing Austin’s SEO game with one hand tied behind your back.

Here’s what worked for me:

* **Name, address, phone number (NAP)**: Keep it consistent. If your GMB says “Suite 203” but your website says “#203,” Google starts having an identity crisis. Ain’t nobody got time for that.
* **Photos, photos, photos**: I uploaded high-quality pictures of every angle of my client’s business. Customers love them, and apparently, so does Google.
* **Reviews that don’t sound like robots wrote them**: Look, I’m not saying bribe your customers for reviews (that’s shady), but a gentle nudge? Totally fine. The more authentic, the better.

And don’t forget to post regularly on your GMB profile. Think of it as a mini social media account but with fewer memes.

# Step 2: Content is (Still) King, but With a Local Twist

Remember that time you Googled **“best pizza in Austin,”** and the results were dominated by blogs, listicles, and Yelp reviews? That’s because content drives local rankings. But you can’t just throw up a 500-word post and call it a day. Your content needs to scream, “I know this city better than anyone else.”

For one of my clients, a small boutique hotel, I wrote blogs like, “**10 Hidden Gems Near South Congress”** and **“How to Spend a Weekend in East Austin.”** Not only did these posts rank like crazy, but they also made visitors stay on the website longer (thank you, internal links!).

**Pro tip:** Use local keywords naturally. “Austin pet groomers” is fine, but something like, “Looking for the best pet groomer in Austin who can make your goldendoodle look like a show dog? We got you,” feels more personal—and Google notices.

# Step 3: Links, Baby!

Okay, [let’s talk backlinks](https://rabbitrank.com/guest-posts/). They’re like the cool kids in high school—if they think you’re worth their time, everyone else does too. But in Austin’s local SEO scene, not all links are created equal.

* **Local news outlets**: Get featured in *Austin Chronicle* or a local blog, and you’re golden.
* **Community involvement**: Sponsor a local event, and you’ll likely land a backlink on their website. Bonus points if it’s a charity event—Google loves that warm and fuzzy stuff.
* **Neighborhood-specific links**: For example, if your business is in East Austin, focus on getting links from other East Austin businesses or neighborhood directories.

I also made a habit of pitching guest posts to local blogs. Sure, it takes time, but when your article on **“Best Coffee Shops for Digital Marketers in Austin”** gets published, you’re not just boosting your rankings—you’re solidifying yourself as a go-to expert.

# Step 4: Technical SEO (Don’t Zone Out, I’ll Keep It Quick)

I know, I know—technical SEO sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry. But hear me out. Google needs to crawl your site without hitting speed bumps, especially when you’re competing in a hot market like Austin.

* **Fast load times**: Nobody wants to wait more than three seconds for a page to load. Not in Austin, not anywhere.
* **Mobile-friendly design**: Austin’s always on the move, and so are its residents. Your site better look amazing on a smartphone.
* **Local schema markup**: This is like giving Google a cheat sheet for what your business is all about. If you don’t know how to add schema, hire someone who does. Trust me, it’s worth it.

# Step 5: Analytics—Because Data Doesn’t Lie

You know what’s more satisfying than ranking #1 for “Austin’s best margaritas”? Knowing *why* you’re ranking. I live for the nerdy stuff like checking which keywords bring in the most traffic or which blog posts make readers stick around the longest. Tools like Google Analytics and Search Console are your best friends here.

One day, I discovered that a random blog post about Austin’s weirdest landmarks was driving a ton of traffic to my client’s website. Guess what we did next? Doubled down on “weird Austin” content. Because in this city, weird wins.

# My Final Thoughts (and a Little Pep Talk)

Look, local SEO in Austin isn’t easy. It’s competitive, ever-changing, and sometimes it feels like Google’s playing a giant game of “gotcha.” But it’s also insanely rewarding. There’s nothing like seeing a business go from invisible to the top of the search results, all because you cracked the code.

If I can do it from a coffee shop with an oat milk latte in hand, so can you. Start with the basics, keep testing what works, and don’t forget to embrace the weirdness—after all, this is Austin we’re talking about. Now go forth and conquer those local search results! 🚀

Let me know how it goes—I’m rooting for you! 😊",1,1735034673.0,RabbitRank,0,1.0,False

1. There is no persistent self.

- preferences, opinions, personality traits

- memories, knowledge 

- habits, addictive behaviours

1hlai8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1hlai8l/my_steady_recovery_story/,My steady recovery story,"Hello,

I've had DPDR for 5 years. When it came on it was out of the blue on a hangover and the terror that came with it was immeasurable. I know there can be a lot of introspection and gloom that comes with searching this condition online so I wanted to share some positive things I've done whilst DPDR'd and how I've reduced it to more of an occasional annoyance without medication.

Whilst DPDR'd I've been best man at my mates wedding doing a speech in front of 100s of people, been sober for 5 years tomorrow, dated and moved in with a long term girlfriend, travelled to different countries for weeks at a time, picked up basic mechanic skills, go to the gym 5 nights a week, maintained a regular social life (this took some time to achieve) and got a new full time office based job. Leaps and bounds ahead of when it first kicked in, house bound for months, researching cures and tips online. Dwelling and ruminating on the strange sensations and unfamiliarity that comes with the anxiety.  
  
Pushing through those feelings and carrying on with life is what **reduced it for me immeasurably**. The first few months were uncomfortable to say the least, staving off frequent panic attacks but overtime I saw it as less and less important. My brain slowly adapted and my focus shifted from the obsessive reality testing to getting on with life again. Seeing the direct correlation between anxiety and dpdr flares really took the edge off it from terrifying to more of an occasional annoyance.

I noticed that I wasn't totally numb at all. I was expecting to panic before I even left the house. ""What if I have a panic attack and feel derealised?"" this for me was the anxiety building before the event even began, a self fulfilling prophecy. I don't think like this at all before I go out now. I just go and do. If I do get any dpdr feelings now I focus my thoughts on what I'm doing in the moment and the feelings pass as quickly as they came (within minutes literally).

I went from limiting what I ate/drank out of fear of ""triggering episodes"" to literally having whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it. I drink coffee, eat chocolate you name it. Life is too short.  

I don't research the condition at all anymore. I don't frequent online forums regarding the condition (this is the first time I've been on in along time and that's just to share something positive for those suffering) or engage in talking about it in real life as there's so many more important things to talk about. Distraction is key, embrace your hobbies. If you don't have any yet, now is the time. Engaging your mind in different things breaks the obsessive cycle.

Yes I still feel off on occasion. I do still get the odd panic flare, head pressure, visual snow you name it but it doesn't control me at all anymore. It's more of an occasional fleeting annoyance than an all consuming fear. I don't sit in waiting to feel better. Push through the sensations that tell you to stay at home, stop logging in and researching it and carry on with your life.  It takes time but its worth it. **The only way out is through**.

1. the ability to sharpen blades with the unglazed ring on the bottom of mug's

This trick pops up a lot in any industry with a lot of knife handling and is common enough that I'm surprised it's not in the game. We can already use things like Metal files to poorly sharpen them in an emergency so why not add coffee cups to the mix?

Just Flip over a ceramic mug, grab your knife, and run the edge of the blade against the unglazed ring on the mug's bottom at a 15- to 20-degree angle. It's nowhere near a good as a whetstone but it definitely gets the job done and would be a great bit of detail of it was added to the game.

2. Sharpening/honing Steels

With butchery, skinning and blade sharpening all added to the game I'm surprised by the lack of Sharpening/honing Steels in the game.

For starters the larger ones would make a great weapon on their own (like a police baton) but they're just as important as a whetstone for maintaining blades

Game Mechanics wise honing a blade before butchering or skinning could be used to avoid muscle fatigue (a real issue in the industry that i thought would be in the game ) and even give you a tiny bit of mantanince xp",3,1735033802.0,projectzomboid,0,1.0,False

**Resources I used:**

**e-Book from Dest Cert** \- Bought this at a super rate (think USD2) when they just launched the 2024 edition. I read this cover to cover once. Kindle app. Looking back, I'd try to read it twice.

I tried the official study book (e-Book) however it is super dry, and I will fall asleep almost immediately.

**Audio book from Dest Cert** \- I listened to this while commuting. I used an app call Audipo where you can bookmark where you stopped - 10/10! IMO, don't have to listen twice.

**Mind Maps from Dest Cert** \- This gives a great overview of how each topic / sub-topic connects. 

**Dest Cert CISSP videos -** Watch all the domains. Their videos are bit sizes, and really good quality production.

It started off pretty normal in the office at work, except the desks were laid out differently and there was a coffee shop on site. I was doing standard things at work, one girl went home as she was upset she hadn't got a promotion she went for (4 girls at work are actually finding this out today). 

And then suddenly I was in some weird version of New York with my parents and we were walking a across a bridge, but on the train tracks and not the path, we tried to walk on the path bit then Kathy Bates who was happily walking her dog appeared and told us we had to stay on the tracks. 

Off the bridge, but by myself now, and it's night and there's a purple hue over the city, and then this group start busking a Lacuna Coil song, it becomes a Flash mob and turns into a different song and I see some of my work girls and we're laughing and having fun (obviously they didn't look at all like my real friends). 

And then suddenly, we're all together, it's day time and it's somber and we're all in this organised line walking down this slope into the water. The City is still around us, but there are hundreds of bodies in the water, wrapped in black plastic. They are, lined up, lining a pathway for us. There's sombre music and we have to try and swim to an unseen platform without dying. But as we get in, we realise that as we swim, we move the water and the bodies start moving with the current and crush us. The water turns bloody with every wave of movement. A few of us make it through, and after evading some skeletal creatures with massive skulls we make it to the platform where everyone is laughing and happy. Then a boat appears and I see more people I know waving. It's like one of the boats from jungle cruise but white, and them I'm telling my friends I'm so happy we're alive and we made it, and she tells me we're dead and we did in fact die back there in the water, but now we're getting on this boat where my friends are waving at me. 

And that's when I woke up and came straight here. 

I also dreamt I was at Universal at one point before all this and we were showing my in-laws around the park, including one who sadly passed away years ago and I'd never met.

","**Calgary, Alberta**

  


*The Conservatives do not understand Provincial Autonomy. Are they really to be taken seriously as a Federal Party?*

  
  


Today while having coffee in my office, I came across a report that the Conservatives are attacking the Liberals and NDP over our Federal Education policy. I, of course, did not think much of it - until the candidate in question began blaming the federal government for a teacher shortage. I comically spat my coffee out of my mouth, laughed, and realised that the Conservatives are **not** as serious as they might seem.

  


Firstly, let’s discuss the responsibilities of education for the Federal Government. We:



1. Do nothing, because we do not have a Minister of Education.

  


Instead, this responsibility is entirely mandated to the Provinces. Yes, the Federal Government can provide additional emergency funding to provinces - but it is largely the responsibility of the Provincial Government to handle their education policy. This means that the Conservatives:

  


1. Seek to destroy our Constitution,
2. Inflate our federal taxes by taking on additional educational responsibilities,
3. Don’t know what they’re talking about

  


This is supposedly the party of common sense in Canada. How can we, as Canadians, hold any faith in an organization which does not understand their powers in a federal government? We in the Liberal Party are champions of Liberty, and we will **defend** our constitution and uphold the rights and powers of the Provinces. We will work with all premiers and their elected Governments, and not seek to strip their powers away from them in a totalitarian powermove.



I am growing increasingly concerned that the Conservatives do not understand the powers the Federal Government has. Our provinces enjoy great autonomy, and I respect our Premiers and the jobs they do. Sometimes it can be hard to govern a province, and we of course will assist when we can - but we will **not** grab at power.



The candidate for Laval-Gatineau-North Shore, Jeremy Hunt, claims that we should be doing “more” to stop the teacher shortage. He actually implies we should offer higher salaries for teachers. As a note: teachers in Quebec earn roughly $32 per hour - as well as a healthy pension and benefits. If there is a teacher shortage in a province, it might be due to other issues unrelated to throwing money at an issue. For example: many new teachers struggle to find LTO in a school board, so they find new careers or move overseas. There might be an issue with this, but again:



**This is not within the power of the federal government to stop.** His heart is, of course, in the right place. Children deserve great education within this country, which is why I (personally) support federally mandated policies such as the RESP. 



Once again, it is the Liberals who have common sense policy. We want to expand the wallets of Canadians, so they can invest in federal programs such as the RESP. This will not only help a teacher shortage (as people can build up tax-free savings to help their children go to school, including teacher’s college) - but offer support and protection.



Our job is to encourage and guide, not to force and demand provinces to follow our whims and wants. If you want the **true** governing party of Canada to lead us, vote Liberal in the election. We actually know what our powers are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding how much water you should consume in a day is crucial for maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Water plays an essential role in virtually every function of your body, from regulating temperature to aiding digestion. Here are ten compelling reasons why knowing your daily water intake needs can greatly benefit your health.

### 1. Boosts Energy Levels

Staying hydrated helps combat fatigue. Even mild dehydration can greatly influence your energy levels. When you drink enough water, you ensure your body operates at peak performance, making you feel more alert and energetic throughout the day.

### 2. Supports Digestive Health

Water is vital for proper digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients so your body can absorb them effectively. Additionally, drinking an adequate amount of water prevents constipation by softening stools and facilitating smoother bowel movements.

### 3. Enhances Weight Management

If you're looking to control your weight, understanding how much water you should drink can be a game-changer. Drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller, which may lead to reduced calorie intake. Often, we mistake thirst for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Staying hydrated can minimize these behaviors.

### 4. Improves Skin Health

Water helps maintain skin elasticity and hydration. When you’re adequately hydrated, your skin looks plumper and more radiant. Drinking enough water can also help reduce the appearance of fine lines and dry patches, promoting a healthy complexion.

### 5. Regulates Body Temperature

Your body uses water to regulate temperature through perspiration. Staying hydrated allows your body to cool itself effectively, which is especially important during hot weather or when exercising. Inadequate water intake can lead to overheating and heat-related illnesses.

### 6. Boosts Physical Performance

Water is key to maintaining performance during workouts. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, reduced motivation, and increased perceived exertion. To maximize your workout and keep your body in top shape, ensure you're consuming enough water each day.

### 7. Supports Kidney Function

The kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste from your blood. Adequate hydration allows them to function effectively, preventing kidney stones and urinary tract infections. Drinking the right amount of water daily promotes optimal kidney health.

### 8. Aids in Nutrient Absorption

- Water is essential for transporting nutrients throughout your body.
- Adequate water consumption helps prevent nutrient deficiencies.
- By staying hydrated, you support the absorption of vitamins and minerals from food.

### 9. Enhances Cognitive Function

Did you know that even mild dehydration can affect your brain function? Water is crucial for concentration, memory, and overall mental performance. Drinking enough water helps maintain focus, reduces anxiety, and promotes a clear mind.

### 10. Promotes Healthy Heart Function

Water plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular health. Staying hydrated ensures your blood volume is adequate, making it easier for your heart to pump blood efficiently throughout your body. This can lower your risk of heart-related issues.

Understanding how much water you should consume in a day is not just about adhering to a guideline; it's about recognizing the many benefits that proper hydration brings to your life. By actively monitoring your water intake, you can experience significant improvements in your physical and mental well-being. Aim to drink enough water daily and enjoy the positive changes in your health.

The Role of Hydration in Boosting Your Energy Levels
----------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is more than just a recommendation; it's a crucial element for maintaining optimal health and energy levels. When you think about feeling tired or sluggish, hydration is often overlooked. However, drinking the right amount of water can significantly boost your energy. Here are some key points explaining the vital connection between hydration and your energy levels.

### Understanding Hydration

Hydration refers to the process of providing adequate fluid to your body. Water is essential because it plays a fundamental role in almost every bodily function. When you are dehydrated, your body can’t function properly, leading to decreased physical and mental performance. You might find it hard to concentrate, feel fatigued, or even experience headaches. This makes understanding how much water you should consume in a day essential for avoiding energy drains.

### Why Hydration Matters for Energy Levels

Here’s why drinking enough water is essential for boosting your energy:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Maintains Essential Bodily Functions:** Water supports digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. When your body functions at its best, your energy levels will naturally rise.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Staying cool helps you maintain your energy. Water regulates your body temperature, preventing fatigue caused by overheating.
- **Supports Cellular Functions:** All cells need water to produce energy. If your cells lack water, energy production slows down, which can lead to feelings of tiredness.
- **Aids in Nutrient Transport:** Water helps transport essential nutrients and oxygen to cells. When your cells receive what they need, they perform better, giving you a natural energy boost.
- **Enhances Physical Performance:** Whether you’re exercising or just going about daily tasks, your physical performance is tied to hydration. Dehydration can lead to poor performance and fatigue during physical activities.
- **Boosts Mental Clarity:** Dehydration affects cognitive function. Staying hydrated can clear up foggy thinking, helping you maintain focus and energy throughout the day.
- **Prevents Fatigue:** When you’re dehydrated, your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This extra strain can cause fatigue, making hydration key for sustained energy.

How Water Intake Affects Your Skin Health
-----------------------------------------

Did you know that your skin health is closely linked to how much water you drink? Staying hydrated is not just important for your overall well-being; it plays a vital role in maintaining vibrant and healthy skin. Let's explore how water intake can significantly affect your skin health.

First off, water is essential for cellular health. Skin cells need water to function properly and remain plump. When you're well-hydrated, your skin appears tighter and more elastic. On the other hand, dehydration can lead to dry, flaky skin. Here’s how adequate water intake can directly benefit your skin:

### 1. Promotes Hydration

Drinking enough water ensures that your skin remains hydrated. When your skin cells hold onto moisture, it gives your skin a youthful appearance and reduces the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles.

### 2. Enhances Elasticity

Proper hydration helps maintain the skin's elasticity. This means that your skin is less prone to sagging and has a healthier bounce. With good elasticity, your skin can better withstand environmental stressors.

### 3. Improves Complexion

When you are hydrated, your complexion looks bright and fresh. On the contrary, dehydrated skin can lead to a dull appearance. Drinking sufficient water helps in flushing out toxins, giving way to clearer skin.

### 4. Reduces Acne and Breakouts

Hydration plays a crucial role in regulating oil production. When your body lacks water, it can overcompensate by producing more oil, which may lead to acne and breakouts. By ensuring adequate water intake, you help minimize these skin issues.

### 5. Aids in Skin Cell Regeneration

Your skin is constantly renewing itself. Water is necessary for this process, as it helps facilitate the removal of dead skin cells and encourages the growth of new ones. A well-hydrated system enhances overall skin texture.

### 6. Helps Prevent Premature Aging

Drinking enough water can help delay the signs of aging. Proper hydration assists in flushing out harmful substances from your body, which prevents damage that could accelerate aging. This means fewer wrinkles and a more youthful glow.

### 7. Supports Nourishment

Water aids in delivering essential nutrients to skin cells. Nutrients from your diet, such as vitamins C and E, are more effective when hydrated properly. This nourishment is vital for maintaining healthy, glowing skin.

### 8. Supports Healing

If you experience cuts, scrapes, or other skin injuries, hydration is key for faster healing. Water helps to reduce inflammation and will speed up the recovery process by delivering nutrients to the impacted areas.

### 9. Buffers Environmental Stressors

Your skin is constantly exposed to environmental pollutants, UV rays, and harsh weather. Adequate water consumption helps to create a barrier against these stressors, maintaining your skin's integrity and vitality.

### 10. Reduces Inflammation

Hydration can help decrease inflammation in the skin. Drinking water has been known to soothe conditions like eczema and psoriasis, providing relief from dryness and irritation.

As you can see, the benefits of staying hydrated go far beyond thirst. To maintain optimal skin health, it’s essential to consider how water intake affects your skin. Aim for at least eight glasses of water per day, adjusting according to your activity levels and environment.

Adding fruits and vegetables with high water content, like cucumbers and oranges, can also aid in hydration. Remember, keeping your skin healthy is not just about applying creams and serums; it starts with what you put into your body. You may be surprised by how much better your skin feels with intentional hydration!

The Connection Between Proper Hydration and Weight Management
-------------------------------------------------------------

Staying properly hydrated is essential for maintaining a healthy weight. When your body is well-hydrated, it can perform essential functions more efficiently. This is particularly crucial in the context of weight management.

Here are several key aspects of how proper hydration plays a significant role in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 1. Reduces Hunger

When you feel hungry, it might be easy to confuse thirst with hunger. Drinking water can help quell those false hunger signals. This can lead to you consuming fewer calories. If you find yourself reaching for a snack, try drinking a glass of water first.

### 2. Supports Metabolism

Your body uses water to process calories. If you're even mildly dehydrated, your metabolism may slow down. Staying hydrated helps in maintaining your metabolic rate, ensuring that your body burns calories more efficiently.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 3. Enhances Physical Performance

Proper hydration is crucial during exercise. When you're well-hydrated, your body can work at peak efficiency. This means you can exercise harder and longer, helping you burn more calories and, in turn, manage your weight more effectively.

### 4. Reduces Liquid Calorie Intake

Choosing water over sugary beverages is one of the simplest ways to reduce your calorie intake. Sugary drinks typically contain empty calories that provide little to no nutritional benefit. By replacing these drinks with water, you can significantly cut down on your daily caloric intake.

### 5. Aids Digestion

Water is essential for digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients and soluble fiber, making it easier for your body to absorb them. Adequate hydration can prevent digestive issues like constipation, a situation that can hinder weight management efforts.

### 6. Improves Mood and Reduces Stress

Dehydration can lead to feelings of fatigue and irritability, which may disrupt your capacity for making healthy food choices. On the other hand, when you're hydrated, you're more likely to maintain a positive mood, making you less inclined to crave unhealthy comfort foods.

### 7. Keeps You Energized

When your energy levels dip due to dehydration, it often leads to a desire for quick fixes like snacks or high-calorie foods. Consuming enough water throughout the day keeps you energized, helping you make better choices instead of reaching for that unhealthy snack.

### 8. Promotes Healthy Skin

Staying hydrated helps maintain skin elasticity and hydration. While it doesn't directly influence weight management, feeling good about your appearance can motivate you to stick to your weight management goals. You might find that you are more inclined to lead an active lifestyle and eat better.

### 9. Helps Control Portions

Drinking a glass of water before meals can help you control portions. It fills your stomach, making you less likely to overeat. This simple habit can be a game-changer in ensuring you don't consume more calories than necessary.

### 10. Creates a Healthy Habit

Making a habit of drinking adequate water can pave the way for other healthy lifestyle choices. When you are mindful of hydrating, you’re more likely to think about your nutritional intake and physical activity as well. It can create a ripple effect, encouraging other positive changes.

### Final Thoughts

By prioritizing hydration, you can significantly enhance your weight management efforts. It’s a simple yet effective strategy that can yield remarkable results. Whether you are looking to lose weight, maintain a healthy weight, or simply feel better overall, don’t underestimate the power of water. Aim for the recommended daily intake and observe how it can transform your life.

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health, but sometimes it can feel challenging to drink enough water throughout the day. Here are some simple tips to help you stay on track and ensure you consume the right amount of water.

### Carry a Water Bottle

One of the easiest ways to remind yourself to drink water is to carry a reusable water bottle with you wherever you go. Choose a bottle that you love, and fill it up in the morning.

### Infuse Your Water

If you find plain water boring, consider infusing it with fruits, herbs, or even vegetables. Here are some ideas to make your water more exciting:

These additions not only enhance the taste but can also provide extra nutrients, making hydration more enjoyable.

### Drink Water After Every Bathroom Break

Use bathroom breaks as a natural reminder to drink water. After you finish, take a sip of water to replenish what you’ve lost. This can help create a consistent routine throughout your day.

### Limit Caffeinated Beverages

Caffeine can lead to dehydration, especially if consumed in excess. While enjoying your favorite coffee or tea is fine in moderation, be mindful of how much you consume. Try to balance it with additional water intake to stay hydrated.

These simple tips into your daily routine can make a significant difference in your hydration levels. By being proactive and using a mix of strategies, you’ll find it easier to consume enough water each day, leading to a healthier lifestyle. Keeping yourself hydrated will not only improve your physical health but can also boost your mood, energy levels, and overall wellness.

### Conclusion

Understanding how much water you should consume in a day is vital for maintaining overall health. Proper hydration plays a key role in boosting your energy levels, allowing you to stay active and focused throughout your day. When you're well-hydrated, your body operates more efficiently, reducing feelings of fatigue and enhancing your overall mood.

At some point, the water is saturated and doesn't extract anymore. 

So I thought, can't you make espresso better by extracting with espresso? To test this, I pulled 10 double shots from my Linea Micra. Then, I emptied the water reservoir and filled it up with the 10 shots to pull another shot. 

This was honestly the best espresso I ever had in my life. It changed my understanding of espresso. Amazing body, very balanced acidity, and outstanding clarity. I haven't seen that much flavor separation before. I could clearly taste all the notes of wood, cereal and napalm in my Starbucks light roast.

But please don't take my word for it, try it out yourself. It's really simple. Just fill the reservoir with espresso, flush, and pull another espresso. Here, I had to grind slightly coarser.

In 2019 i met this guy at the gym, i was coming off an abusive relationship and didnt allow myself proper time to heal. We had seen each other at the gym but he wasnt really my type. I kind of brushed it off Until one day he walked up to me and started flirting. In my mind i was like ha! This naked mole rat kinda has a personality. Long story short we exchanged numbers and went on our first date. This man started love bombing the heck out of me, something i was deprived from in the previous abusive relationship (compliments, physical touch, etc). We end up having a conversation and we decide to become bf/gf. About a month after we start dating, im clocking into work when i get a frantic call from him. He says hey im in a lot of trouble. Ive been lying to get benefits saying im married and my command wants some kind of documentation or im super f**ked. He was in the 160th in ft campbell so im listening on the other side and me trying to be helpful say what needs to happen? He says we need to go get married now. Im like now? Like today? Im hesitant because its only been a month of dating. I accept because i was like dang that would suck for him to loose his military career. To cut the story short, i end up deciding to join the military so i could go to school. I never in my heart thought such an ugly guy would cheat because i was a model signed by an agency, very bubbly personality and i like to think a reasonable person. Anywho, i met his daughter and family before going to basic training. Im gonna skip many details but we wrote each other every day. Im religious and often times i have dreams that are revelations. So one night i have this terrible dream where im video chatting him and he answers short of breath, i ask him whats going on and he says nothing. I tell him to show me the house and he says no so i threaten to leave him and he spins the camera and shows me around the house to which there is a woman wearing my lingerie holding my dogs. I woke up from this dream drenched in sweat, vomitting and shaking violently. I wrote him about it and he said i love you id never cheat on you. Letters later he starts introducing a woman who was mentoring him in his photography business named izzy. Basic training ends and i get my phone back. On the first day i arrive at AIT, he asks me straight up if i wanted to do a 3-some, me being petty i was like what are you gonna do with 5 inches on a good day and a 5 minute pump and dump bc you suck in bed and now u want a 2 nd person involved? He started gaslighting me and then hangs up and stops talking to me for like a week as a form of punishment for rejecting his proposal. I was ashamed, disgusted and felt betrayed, I just got to AIT, weve been married 6 months at this point and i have shared my beliefs and that im a monogamous person. Normally, i loose my sh*t and begin questioning where the question came from and was there someone else to which he denies. After opening my instagram (which he had my passwords to all my socials) i realized i had some girls who had been messaging me pictures with him naked in bed, guys that were my friends and knew him that had seen him clubbing and going home with 3 girls etc. mind you there was at least 12 different people confirming he was out there super throwing that dangalang around town. I was disgusted and disappointed. But something stood out. I find izzy on instagram and realized shes married and has a son. I look for the husband of izzy on instagram bc i wanted to ask him about why my ex had been over at her house until 3am about 4 weeks after i got to AIT for reference, We had the my location 360 and this day he was there he had ignored my phone call and wasnt even texting back. I didnt know it was her address but i went full fbi investigation mode and found the address belonged to a man with the last name izzy had. I check my blocked contacts on instagram and low and behold, it was izzys husband we can call him carter that my ex husband had blocked. I unblock him and we begin going back and forth. Turns out My ex husband we can call him brayden and carter had almost killed each other over izzy bc carter caught them cheating. Many other things happened but the funniest thing is when i confronted him he said im sorry, i accidentally slipped into her vagina. It was an accident but can we just talk about this later its cold outside. When i got back 9 months later, i filed for divorce. He wanted me to forgive him and come back to live with him but i cut him off completely. Ladies, never betray your beliefs for a man, itll leave you feeling disgusting. Im glad i didnt because i married my soulmate we can call him marcus. My husband marcus had been trying to win me over but i tried to decline kindly by saying i just wasnt in a place to love anyone because i had to learn to love myself.I was convinced id never date again after that trainwreck.  my plan was to go out for coffee and then let him down gently. His mother was in town and she was precious, she told me she would make me a keto friendly meal and to come over for dinner. after meeting his mother on that faithful day, i was enamored at how he treated her with such love and respect. I knew then and there i wanted to be a part of their family. For reference his parents are hapily married 28 years going strong, they are everything i never had in my family (stability, emotional maturity, nurturing and kind, educated, and overall amazing people) and my husband is like an angel. Hes never put me through any bullshit, or heart ache, he always thinks about my feelings, he constantly validates me, has amazing communication skills, is extremely loving, faithful, and speaks to my love language every single day, hes also super handsome and takes his fitness seriously and has even taken care of me financially so i could finish school. We bought a house together, got married, got 2 pugs, and im almost done with engineering school. Im so glad that day just happened to be the beginning of our love story because when i say, a real man will do all the things these yucky boys could never do for you. Best of luck to all the girlies reading/hearing this, please run at the first lie, or fishy thing you see. Its not worth it. I should have ran from brayden when he asked me to marry him because he lied.. btw, hes ugly asf😂 never settle for anything less than the best 💅🏽💀 my revenge is that he is still dating around and im over here thriving and going strong!

- 20grams of coffee

First Brew:

Grind size: 4.0 (1Zpresso ZP6)

Water temp: 94°C

Total brew time: 2:45

Brew technique: Bloomed with 50ml water for 45 seconds. Second pour untill 200ml. Third pour untill 300ml. Swirl at the end.

Result: Muted flavors, lacked clarity. Couldn’t pick out the tasting notes.


Second Brew:

Grind size: 3.7

Water temp: 96°C

Brew technique: Same method as above. Total brew time stayed around 3:15.

Result: Better extraction but now tastes bitter, almost like supermarket coffee, and still no distinct specialty coffee notes.

I’m aiming to bring out the passionfruit, prune, and creamy notes but can’t seem to find the right balance. Any tips to improve clarity and balance? Should I tweak the grind, pouring technique, or ratio?

These prints there not good like. But my roof is shiny and the only way to not make Is to smudge your hand into it like if your hand was moist and leaves a print behind.

1hl9nj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitiligo/comments/1hl9nj8/5year_change_compact_summary_future_plan/,5-year change compact summary + future plan.,"Born 1983.

Vitiligo since age of 10.

Started researching 2020.

Started taking 60K IU vitamin D3 per day for 3 months.

Instant repigmentation started.

Herpes Zoster erupted on back of my neck (probably due to vitamin D blasting.. don't take more than 10K per day, every other day, and have 1-month off every other month)

The herpes zoster healed and turned to granuloma anulare (probably an inflammatory process.. creating some excess skin bumps and actually depigmented areas inside)

Half a year after - I completely stopped gluten \\ grain, and all processed food.

Also avoiding solanine and lectins.

(Plant based diet.. no dairy.. lowering citrus fruits amounts)

Also in that period I stopped coffee and caffeine.. but unfortunately got back to it now. (1 cappuccino  a day.. need to stop)

Current situation:

Any area with vitiligo that is exposed to the sun daily - is almost 90-95% repigmented.

My first ever patch from age 10 on the forehead - remains.

All other parts - no change.

Tried NBUVB treatment.. not for me. (too much time and mess and I don't want to affect healthy skin)

So **SUN** is a major contributor to the process of repigmentation.. once all the vitiligo conditions are cancelled. (And vitamin D levels are ok, especially if you have genetic vitamin D polymorphism)

Vitiligo, and any other autoimmune.. starts from the gut, brain and nervous system.

I took probiotics for gut microbiome (C-sected so my microbiome is forever damaged)

I took chlorella to remove toxic metals from body and brain.

And avoiding gluten allowed to heal gut (leaky gut and villi health).

Reducing stress is also very important (grounding, ashwagandha, no chemical stress - removing caffeine, physical activity and intense workout.. walking.. sleeping...)

BUT - the patches that matter to me the most - around the lips - still there.

(Probably not seeing sunlight...)

So future plans may include:

1. Sun exposure for face.. 15-30 minutes a day, with eyes NOT covered! (but protected from direct sun)
2. NBUVB for face areas. (I have the small Dermapal lamp.
3. Excimer UVB laser for face. (this is just a focused UVB beam).. might lead to good results.
4. Opzelura for face (last option)

(I'm now taking 5000-10000 IU vitamin D daily, 2mg copper, zinc, probiotics and 2g chlorella)

1hl9mmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1hl9mmm/24122024/,24/12/2024,"Today has been…. busy. Again. More prep. God. 

I have - 

* Made a quiche and a frittata for tomorrow, the frittata is a spring greens one with asparagus, spinach, leeks and caramelised onion and Parmesan. The quiche is a roasted veggie, spinach, caramelised onion and Parmesan one. They both turned out well I think, though idk how they’ll taste and I don’t follow recipes just eyeball it all sooo guess we’ll see. 
* Potted my plants again because the other ones were a failure 
* Tidied the living area - that’s a bigger job than it sounds 
* Cleaned the kitchen
* Helped dad hang the big massive mirror in the bathroom 
* Helped dad hang more paintings around the place 
* Hung the fairy lights up 
* Moved mums desk and set it back up again

That doesn’t sound like much but some things took awhile and there were other bits and pieces throughout like some laundry and training pups and whatnot. 

I’m truly so excited for Boxing Day when I can finally relax and open up one of my books! 

I’m nervous about tomorrow. I know they’re my family but that doesn’t really lessen any anxiety, tbh it makes it worse because I feel like there are additional expectations eg I should be comfortable with them and I should be able to easily make conversation with them and all that when I don’t feel that way. And I’m nervous the kids won’t like me because I didn’t go to the last birthday because I basically had a minor breakdown. And idk. I’m just nervous. And I’m nervous no one will like their presents. And if no one eats my quiche/frittata? Or worse, they put it on their plate, take a bite and then leave the rest for the bin. And I know I’m going to look even uglier than usual, my allergickyness is a lot better to be fair which is a godsend but they’re not entirely back to normal yet and also I just feel so pasty and blah and ugly. I don’t mind being pale so much, I don’t ever use fake tan anymore and haven’t in ages, though I might try a gradual very light one this summer for a bit of a subtle glow not a tan but just to take the edge off because otherwise people think it’s okay to comment and say “wow you sure don’t let yourself see the sun” or “wow look at my arm compared to yours you’re so white” and while it’s not the end of the world it also makes me feel ugly because ever talks about pale skin being nice or the ideal, it’s always a golden tan. Idk. Anyway it doesn’t matter. I hope they all go home earlyish tomorrow. I think they’re arriving at midday and then probably leaving around 5? I know it’ll be okay enough - I mean tomorrow isn’t life or death or anything is it. 

I’m also not really looking forward to presents in the morning with mum and dad. Mum got me some and idk how to say this but she never really picks things I want or like. And it makes me feel bad. I obviously don’t show even an ounce of this but I wish she’d just get me nothing instead. She hasn’t wrapped mine so they won’t be wrapped either which is whatever. Tbh I don’t care anymore. I do care, I care a lot, but what’s the point, so I don’t. The thing is I love Christmas, it’s my favourite holiday, but idk maybe I love the idea of it more than the day itself. It just feels like no one puts the thought or detail into it that I want. It’s not my day though so that’s just me being picky and difficult in thinking that. Why am I so awful? I live the gesture and everything like I am definitely not upset or anything, it just feels wasteful I guess. Idk. I think I’m equally very easy and very hard to buy presents for. 

Tomorrow’s going to suck because a whole lot still hasn’t been done - ie moving the furniture. And I have to wrap all the presents mum bought for the others and tidy up again because dads left his tools everywhere and help mum make the salads and pick flowers from the garden for around the house and all that. It’s fine. It’s just not one thing about this holiday so far has been relaxing and I feel like I’m going to cry because I’m a baby. I just wish more prep had been done in the lead up to this. Don’t offer to host and then transfer all these jobs to me who said DONT HOST IT. I’ve already suggested future years no one hosts and we all take a dish and have a picnic somewhere and then all go separate ways - that seems way better in my head. No house prep, no one person having to shoulder the cost and cooking, you can leave when you want to leave and you can go somewhere pretty. Perfect, no? I’ll make a note to suggest it properly next year. I wonder what Christmas with Andy’s family will be like? Will I be invited? I feel like his Christmas Eve with his mum and sister would feel really gatecrashy? Family time with the OG’s… and then there’s me hanging about getting in the way. It feels less gatecrashy with his dad as it’s not the OG’s as he has his partner and her daughter so it feels less intimate? But then it’s not like I can just stay at Andy’s place alone can I? Well I could, but a) I know he wouldn’t allow that b) it would be weirder knowing I’m not there and sat alone in his apartment than me being there and c) if his sister had a partner I’m sure they would go? Maybe? Idk. Also I want to wake him up on christmases with a bj and have him fuck me senseless, he can’t do that at his mother’s. Well he *could* but I’d really rather not. But then he also couldn’t do that here either at my parent’s house. Hm. Okay well anyway who knows. Maybe we can also sometimes just have Christmases just us two? I’d really love that a lot tbh. Maybe rent an airbnb and go away for a few days just us two, maybe somewhere we can do swimming and laze about and read and play games and cuddle and all sorts. And just have our own Christmas lunch and not have it be a big song and dance just be nice and chill. I wonder if Christmas lingerie should be red or green? I wonder if there’s actual Christmassy lingerie? Like imagine a red sheer bra with a lil white trim along the top? And same for the underwear? Or a red sheer babydoll with white trim? Cute, no? Then again I don’t want *cute*. It’s not cute though, I’m just lazy with language. But green is also nice. Like a deep pine forest green. And suspenders and thigh high stockings. This would all be a lot better if we weren’t going to be in 10,000° Sydney heat. What’s the bet I get all dolled up in some outfit and do my hair and makeup and then by the end of it I’m dead and a pool of sweat. ICK. So idk. Anyway. 

So tomorrow I need to be up early, like 8am, to keep setting up and then also for family presents time where we have croissants and coffee and orange juice - basically the only tradition we have. And it was almost not going to happen. That’s what I meant before, we have ONE tradition and they weren’t even bothered about it. It makes me feel stupid and sad. But they got them and so we can have it. I didn’t make a big deal at all, it sounded like I did didn’t it? Idk. 

I’m showered and in bed now. He’s having dinner with his mum and sister, I hope it’s going well. I love him so much. 

I feel weird. 

I think I’ll do some meditation now, because I can feel how tight my jaw is clenched from anxiety and stress and I’m not breathing well it’s all shallow and anxy-esque so I shall do some guided meditation and just try relax.

I work at a supermarket thing, as a cashier, and sometimes there’s like 4-5 people standing around talking in customer service. Like. I can list 10 things you could be doing right now. No wonder we’re constantly behind and piling up on tasks?  
It just pisses me off SO much that there’s so much to do, and no one doing it. It’s stressful to me?  

I’ve seen a lot of different memes / texts posts and such online, where the idea is that “we show up to work, pretend to work, but really no one knows what they’re doing” kind of?  
Work is just socializing, drinking coffee and going for lunch almost? They don’t do the work. They don’t even know what the work is. 

Imagine if NTs actually *worked* while they were at work? I am willing to bet my ENTIRE book collection that the average work week would be *way* less than 36.9 (EU average) / 38.6 (USA average) hours.  
I’ve also seen quite a few people taking less time to finish a task, and then being assigned more work, and not just being done for the day. I obviously understand why it’s like that, but imagine if people actually just did their jobs? That speed (aka, actually doing it) would make everything run so much smoother. 

THEY are the lazy ones. They are the ones who don’t want to work (in comparison to NDs). They’re the ones “raking up” the average work hours. I imagine we could almost half the work week if everyone was ND.  
And because some people slack off, it impacts everyone. If you can’t get a reply, then you can’t answer whoever, and they can’t do whatever they have to do, and so on and so forth. 

Am I the only one who has noticed that? Am I the only one who’s actually so exasperated by the NT work ethic?  
I went on sick leave last month, due to stress and overstimulation and being discriminated at work and winter depression, and it’s been tough.  
I think back on working, with very fond memories (even though it was really difficult at times). I love my customers and making them smile and all that I do. But then I remember the sheer lack of interest in anyone doing any actual work.  
I’ve started volunteering, just 2 hours 4 days a week, it’s overstimulating, but it’s good. It’s at a kindergarten (with my mom) so it’s a noisy environment, but I really just have to color and build legos while also being in charge. A dream come true. Totally chill. A little noisy, but otherwise surprisingly okay.  
Like, I *want* to work, but NTs make it impossible?

Scouring through the DeFi space it can be hard to differentiate the diamonds from the trash.

so how do you make the judgement on what is truly good? I have seen so many communities claiming ""Mine is the best! we are different!""

Thats not to mention how many are made on a daily basis,

""Every day, between 40,000 and 50,000 new meme coins are created, according to BDC, an Estonia-based blockchain consultancy. Nearly 13 million have already been created in 2024""

There often remains a clear lack of alpha, genuine content and general conviction in the shilling methods I see. Just AI images that dont reveal anything.

\-----------

**Let me introduce to you, what I believe is King.**

The market just had a massive correction the a few days ago and saw billions wiped out. Everything crashed and saw negative.

During this - Kendu gained holders and outperformed the market. The community kept doing what it does best, working and showing how diamond handed they all are. The level we are at now is a complete bottom that genuinely only has upside.

[Certik Audit](https://preview.redd.it/2qr841gmcr8e1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f00146be3eeab2a6aa954034d24f7962fe3c179c)

Kendu has recently become the second of all time to complete the massive 50 000 certik votes organically, only behind Pepe which is 10B+ now.

The audit has been signed and is currently in the works. Certik even was so impressed by our communities efforts that they will begin doing an awareness campaign for Kendu . They similarly have posted about Pepe in the past in where the posts saw view counts in the 200k +

We are also only 1 of 2 memecoins in existence with our own dedicated stocktwits page. Them also consistently making posts on X about Kendu being in the top 10-5 most active cryptos on all of stocktwits. The CEO of the company even recently mentioned the Kendu ticker in one of his posts.

Not only do we dominate the digital scape though, but we have transcended beyond ""memecoin""

Our community knows that it is a game of awareness, so we do exactly that.

[Kendu Mural](https://preview.redd.it/2rj4a9mncr8e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb119faff208b168b187863b9c4724da25cc514)

Recently one of our community members (OG chadette who helped run up Shiba inu to the billions) is smashing out murals in the middle of Miami.

She attended the Miami Art Basel event handing out hundreds of our energy drinks cans, and placing this painting right on one of the busiest intersections where it will now remain.

We also have branding that is simply not seen elsewhere in memes, such as our energy drinks that can be seen in front of the mural.

In addition to that, we have just had a new addition to our products, Kendu Gum. Thats now alongside our jewellery, hot sauce, coffee beans and even a protein supplement range on the whey.

We have chads jumping out of planes, 12 community tattoos (one on a guys willy), people climbing off buildings, smashing plates and going out on the streets everyday all in the name of getting Kendu to be number 1.

This is what sets the community apart.

All of this is decentralised community effort, all individuals initiatives who know Kendu is going to the billions this cycle and who know Kendu is their ticket to financial freedom.

Kendu is more than just a memecoin. We are a genuine movement with branding and products alike.

Our ethos is ""we do not gamble, we work"" and we are using the Kendu canvas to paint our wildest imaginations.

Kendu has recently become the second of all time to complete the massive 50 000 certik votes organically, only behind Pepe which is 10B+ now.

The audit has been signed and is currently in the works. Certik even was so impressed by our communities efforts that they will begin doing an awareness campaign for Kendu . They similarly have posted about Pepe in the past in where the posts saw view counts in the 200k +

We are also only 1 of 2 memecoins in existence with our own dedicated stocktwits page. Them also consistently making posts on X about Kendu being in the top 10-5 most active cryptos on all of stocktwits. The CEO of the company even recently mentioned the Kendu ticker in one of his posts.

Not only do we dominate the digital scape though, but we have transcended beyond ""memecoin""

Our community knows that it is a game of awareness, so we do exactly that.

1hl96to,https://www.thedriftmag.com/in-ruins/,"In Ruins​ | Archaeological Warfare in the West Bank, Palestine ","On the quiet afternoon of March 5, 2024 in the northern occupied West Bank, I watched as a convoy of Israeli military jeeps drove along a narrow, winding road lined with terraced olive groves, passing the remnants of at least ten major civilizations dating back to the Bronze Age, to the summit of the tallest hill in Sebastia, a Palestinian village of about four thousand people. Near the hilltop archaeological site, a squadron of soldiers climbed out of their jeeps, toppled the flagpole erected there, and removed its Palestinian flag. Whether the soldiers were following orders or going rogue — an IDF spokesperson said that “IDF soldiers are prohibited from removing flags that are not associated with terrorist organizations or unauthorized unions” — the flag disappeared with them. Within an hour, a group of teenagers arrived and raised a new one in its place.

If God shook a dice cup of stone ruins and rolled them across the green earth, it might look something like Sebastia. The main acropolis slopes into a small town square, where locals sit in plastic chairs under towering arches. Some of the homes are built from Roman blocks; some are dotted with bullet holes. To the neighboring settlers, Sebastia is known by another name: Samaria, after the three-thousand-year-old capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and their preferred term for the surrounding region. Settlers refer to the entire West Bank as “Judea and Samaria,” reverting to biblical toponyms to bolster their religious entitlement to the land. Just past the valley, on top of another hill, you can see where the settlers live: a plot of cream-colored houses with terracotta roofs known as Shavei Shomron, or Returnees to Samaria.

The high-stakes game of capture the flag has been playing out intermittently for years, but since October 7, soldiers have been coming to the hilltop with increasing frequency and hostility, sometimes firing warning shots as they drive up the road. On March 6, they turned their guns on a crowd and hit Ayman Shaer, a 27-year-old construction worker, in the thigh with a butterfly bullet. He collapsed near the acropolis. Shaer’s father told Al Jazeera that the soldiers beat him when he tried to help and blocked an ambulance from reaching his son. The soldiers continued up the hill and left with the flag. Before nightfall, the teens had raised a new one: an act of defiance not without its risks. Sebastia’s Mayor Mohammad Azem told me that earlier this year an IDF commander warned him that if the flag-raising continued, the recently renovated village center would be demolished — even though it is situated within a forum built by King Herod of Judea in the first century B.C.E., a landmark of the Jewish history that, in the settlers’ view, gives them a right to Sebastia in the first place. (The IDF declined to comment on the shooting of Shaer and on Azem’s allegation.)

The struggle over the flag, fought among the ruins, is also a struggle over the ruins themselves, the history those ruins speak to, and what they say about who gets to live on this land. With the world’s focus on Israel’s multi-front war across the Middle East and its continued destruction of Gaza — a place with relatively little religious significance for Jews — the most extreme right-wing cabinet ministers in Israel’s history have kept their eyes on the true prize: “Judea and Samaria.” This summer, two new policy initiatives, both nominally limited to governing archaeological practice, opened a bureaucratic pathway for Israel to annex the West Bank. So far, these measures have gone mostly uncovered by the international press. 

When I checked into Sebastia’s Al-Kayed Palace Guest House in March, its owner told me I was his second guest since the start of the war — the first was in January, and it was also me. I met Zaid Azhari, a tour guide who offered to take me around town and translate my interviews, at a chicken shack warmed by vats of boiling olive oil. The locals were discussing what they termed the “ice cream ceasefire,” a reference to Biden’s recent remark — made while holding a mint chip cone — that he hoped a deal would be announced soon. “Once Israel has wiped out Gaza,” Azhari asked me, “will your media pay attention to what’s happening here?”

 

On October 1, 2023, a group of IDF soldiers and settlers from Shavei Shomron accompanied a cohort of Israeli politicians on a visit to Sebastia. Among them were Yossi Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council, who oversees 35 settlements in the northern West Bank and would be photographed just weeks later distributing assault rifles to settlers, and Idit Silman, Israel’s Minister of Environmental Protection. A video Silman shared on Facebook depicts the pair strolling through part of Sebastia’s acropolis, where a Roman basilica once stood. Now, it is a two-thousand-square-meter expanse of patchy grass and stone formations framed by three surviving colonnades. They take selfies with settler children and pose with men in Israelite costumes. “Only those who aren’t connected to this place, only those whose hearts are not here, could destroy and desecrate this historical place,” reads the text overlay. “The amazing land of Israel belongs to us,” a caption adds, “and we will continue to expand in and settle it.”

The visit marked the festival of Sukkot, but the entourage was also celebrating something else: the Knesset’s approval, that May, of Silman’s $8.8 million proposal to transform Sebastia’s ruins into an Israeli tourist destination, akin to the City of David, a theme park in Palestinian East Jerusalem that critics have referred to as a “biblical Disneyland.” In July, Israel allocated an additional $32 million to preserve and develop heritage sites across the West Bank, with what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as a “significant budget” for cameras, drones, and other security measures. Announcing the investment, he said, “In every corner of Judea and Samaria, one need only put a spade into the ground in order to uncover archaeological finds that attest to our deep roots in the Land of Israel.” 

Even within the region’s extraordinary archaeological landscape, Sebastia stands apart for the remarkably diverse range of civilizational remains found within its soil — only some of which come from the Israelites. First settled by the Canaanites as far back as 4,000 B.C.E., Sebastia is among the oldest continuously inhabited places in the area. According to the Bible, King Omri purchased the land for 150 pounds of silver thousands of years ago. The city, located at the crossroads of one trade route from the mountainous north and another from the fertile Jordan Valley, became a cultural and commercial hub. The Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians then took turns conquering and ruling the region. In 331 B.C.E., Alexander the Great destroyed and rebuilt the city of Samaria. Some three hundred years later, the Romans seized the land, and Emperor Augustus (Greek name: Sebastos) handed it to the Judean King Herod, who renamed it in the emperor’s honor. Over the next 1,500 years, Sebastia saw the rise and bloody fall of the Byzantines, Abbasids, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, and Ottomans.

The seeds of an archaeological program connecting the Bible to the land were planted well before Netanyahu’s government began converting ruins into theme parks. In 1867, anticipating the Ottoman Empire’s fall, British explorers from the Palestine Exploration Fund descended on Jerusalem for an extensive land surveying campaign. The Archbishop of York spelled out the true aspiration of this self-proclaimed scientific expedition in a speech at the group’s inaugural meeting: “No country should be of so much interest to us as that in which the documents of our Faith were written.” 

For as long as archaeology has existed — straddling the pliable boundary between the hard and soft sciences — it has been implicated in contests over historical narrative and national identity. In her landmark 2002 book, Facts on the Ground, anthropologist Nadia Abu El-Haj argued that science and ideology are inseparable in archaeology. The “empirical facts” of the discipline are actually cultural products shaped by land access, funding, political interests, excavation methods, the prioritization and interpretation of particular artifacts, and the physical impact of archaeologists’ practices on the land — the laboratory itself is changed with each new study. Abu El-Haj asserted that the Israeli nation-state, its cultural imagination, and the field of archaeology developed in a “mutually constitutive relationship,” each reinforcing and shaping the others. This interplay, she wrote, generated a network of “common-sense assumptions” that formed the epistemological foundation of the Zionist project, influencing everything from national mythology to civic planning. 

When early Zionists arrived in Palestine at the turn of the century, they, like the members of the Palestine Exploration Fund, searched for evidence of Old Testament stories. In 1908, the prominent Jewish American financier Jacob Schiff funded the first dig of Sebastia — which was also the first wholly American excavation in any part of Ottoman Palestine. As the Palestinian architect and artist Dima Srouji has documented, Harvard archaeologists relied on the labor of local men, women, and children to execute the project. They extracted thousands of artifacts and effectively looted the town of its treasures, which they shipped to universities and museums across the world. Such archaeological projects across Palestine grew in scope, reappropriating the Bible into a definitive history upon which a lost people could reclaim their land and rebuild their nation. 

Soon after Israel was founded in 1948, the state’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, encouraged archaeological work, writing that “many mounds await a Jewish spade to disclose the riddle of their past.” Yigael Yadin, who served as the IDF’s chief of staff from 1949 to 1952, went on to lead digs at important sites like Hazor, Masada, and Megiddo in the fifties and sixties. Archaeology became a national obsession, taught in schools, highlighted in museums, and practiced by amateur volunteers. The rugged Israeli Jew, unlike his bookish, diasporic cousins, was to be rooted in the land.

After the Six-Day War in 1967, the Israeli government quickly set in motion plans to excavate newly occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank. These digs violated the spirit of the Hague Convention of 1954 and UNESCO recommendations, which all together affirm that people under military occupation do not forfeit ownership of their cultural assets and that an occupier’s activities must be limited to salvaging and preserving antiquities. But few in Israel objected to the post-war wave of excavations. As Rachel Poser wrote in Harper’s in 2019, “The most fervent critics of archaeology at the time were ultra­orthodox haredim, who believed that the dig was disturbing Jewish graves.” In the seventies, eighties, and early nineties, they threw stones at archaeologists and burned their offices. But opposition began to cool as some rabbis were brought into the bureaucratic bodies that oversaw archaeology and right-wing settlers recognized the discipline’s power to advance their agenda. In 1981, Israel Harel, a founder and chairman of the Yesha Council — a successor to the religious ultranationalist Gush Emunim movement that had been instrumental in the 1977 establishment of Shavei Shomron — sent a memo to Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s administration concerning the occupied territories’ archaeological potential that urged the government “to ensure that the Jewish people are in control of the sites which embody its history, its memories and the most obvious and direct testament to its roots and right to the land.” 

As the archaeologist Alon Arad, the head of an Israeli NGO that fights against the instrumentalization of archaeology in Israel, pointed out to me, the connection between the presence of artifacts and current land rights does not withstand much scrutiny. Following the same logic, Arad said, “Italy can claim ownership over half of England, Mongolia can claim ownership over most of Eastern Europe. Greece can claim ownership over India. It depends where you cut in time.” But the Israeli state has constructed an effective machine for converting archaeological discovery into territorial power. The same year Harel wrote his memo, Israel established the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) to coordinate its administrative activities in the West Bank, including issuing travel permits, managing infrastructure, and overseeing archaeological heritage sites. The new body created an ostensible firewall between governance of the West Bank and governance of Israel proper. Technically subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, the ICA has demolished Palestinian buildings, evicted residents, and seized land under the pretext of “salvaging or preserving antiquities.” (The ICA declined to comment on these practices.) To the extent that the ICA’s Archaeology Unit engages in authentic research, it largely operates within a black box and is known for publishing its findings selectively, a taboo practice in any scientific community.

Israel’s control over West Bank antiquities tightened with 1995’s Oslo II Accord, which placed more than half of the region’s six-thousand-plus archaeological sites under Israel’s jurisdiction — part of a broader agreement dividing the territory into areas of Israeli and Palestinian control. Arad posited to me that, following the Oslo Accords, religious Zionists “understood how vulnerable the settlements in the West Bank” were, and as part of their “search for new and innovative ways to anchor” the Jewish connection to the land, they embraced projects such as the excavation of the City of David. Settler-driven archaeology “escalated dramatically when they got a second reminder” of their vulnerability following the 2005 withdrawal of Israeli troops and settlers from Gaza. Today, members of Netanyahu’s far-right cabinet endorse the settler movement’s view of archaeology as a tool for dispossession. Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu, for instance, has pointed to Jewish “roots and history” on both sides of what he refers to as the “fictitious” Green Line separating Israel from its occupied territories, effectively erasing the distinction between the two — an essential rhetorical and legislative step in the plan for complete annexation.

 

“Here, I can build,” Jihad Ghazal said, pointing to an interactive map of Sebastia on a dusty monitor. “Here, I can’t.” Ghazal, the town’s municipal engineer, sat chain-smoking in his office, surrounded by half-filled cups of coffee. On his screen, a red zig-zagging line separated Sebastia into zones marked “B” and “C,” denoting two of the three jurisdictions established by the Oslo II Accord. Area A, which does not overlap with Sebastia, is administered by the Palestinian Authority; Area B, where much of the village sits, is under Palestinian civil and joint Palestinian and Israeli security control; Area C, where some of Sebastia’s most cherished archaeological sites are located, is under full Israeli authority.

To rationalize control over West Bank archaeological sites and their surrounding areas, settlers and right-wing Israeli officials frequently accuse Palestinians of raiding and vandalizing ancient Jewish sites. “We must put an end to the extensive looting and destruction that the Palestinian Authority carries out in our country,” Shlomo Ne’eman, a former head of the Yesha Council, told The Jerusalem Post. When Netanyahu announced the latest round of funding, he promised that $4.5 million of it would go to “rehabilitating archaeological sites that have been damaged by the Palestinians.” According to Adi Shragai of the settler lobbying organization Preserving the Eternal, “eighty percent of these sites were damaged severely” as a result of “an organized plan of the Palestinian Authority to take control over these sites and to eliminate the connection of the Jewish people to this country.” 

The use of archaeology to justify contemporary claims to the land may incentivize exactly the behavior Netanyahu and his allies claim they are trying to prevent. “If one knows for a fact that once a new ancient Israelite site or Judaic remain is uncovered that land is going to be expropriated,” Abu El-Haj asked in a 2014 interview, “why wouldn’t one want to hide it — destroy it even?” As she observed, “One’s very ability to live on one’s own land, in one’s own home, hangs in the balance.” Yet some of the damage to Sebastia’s ruins can be attributed to the fact that the town is a “living and breathing archaeological site,” as Srouji put it. “The ruins of Sebastia are not merely property of the deceased to be collected by institutions,” she wrote. Instead, Sebastia’s residents treat its ruins as “parts of a living heritage and a local economy.” 

The most glaring contradiction to Shragai’s argument is the damage caused by Israeli excavations. According to Abu El-Haj, Israelis have used bulldozers at digs to quickly “get down to the earlier strata, which are saturated with national significance.” In one dig she participated in, organized by the Department of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University, she claimed that bulldozers “summarily destroyed” the remains above the layer of interest. Poser also recorded the use of tunneling — “considered bad practice by most archaeologists, who ordinarily excavate from the topsoil down, removing each layer one by one to avoid conflating time periods” — at an excavation led by the settler organization Elad in East Jerusalem. After we spoke in his office, Ghazal led us through the village and down a staircase to a graveyard of Roman monuments shrouded in weeds and moss: an eroded lion’s head, a cracked coffin, fragments of a sarcophagus half-buried in dirt. There, in 1979, Israeli authorities attempted to transfer a portion of the stone ruins out of Palestinian control. The extraction ultimately failed, leaving the artifacts in pieces at the bottom of a pit alongside the abandoned Israeli equipment.

The IDF’s operations around Sebastia have also harmed artifacts. Azem and Ghazal described how soldiers demolished twelve newly installed streetlights in 2023, disrupting the electrical system and toppling ancient Roman columns in the process. (An IDF spokesperson told me that “the matter involved enforcement against lighting fixtures that were installed at an archaeological site in violation of the law, causing damage to it,” but did not address the allegation that the soldiers themselves had damaged the columns. I saw the downed poles and columns, and reviewed an official municipal document that reported the details of the incident.) Before a storm in January, Azem said, he sent a worker to clear water channels of debris. While the job was underway, Israeli soldiers allegedly detained him and confiscated his bulldozer. (The IDF declined to comment on this incident.) As the rain fell, Azem recounted, water overflowed from the channels and flooded the streets, halting activity in the town and upending another Roman column. 

If not for the occupation, Ghazal said, his top priority would be “to restore our archaeological sites so we can share our history with the world.” Today, empty soda cans and candy wrappers litter the ancient sites. Small flowers bloom from the cracks of the fallen columns. Local officials can’t perform even the most basic cleaning and maintenance tasks in Area C. Beyond the ruins, Israel has restricted the movement of Sebastia’s garbage trucks; settlers have dumped wastewater and sewage on Palestinians’ land. 

Disruption of the town’s basic civic functions was constant — Ghazal’s tour was interrupted by news that an Israeli bulldozer had driven into Sebastia and deposited a mound of dirt and boulders in the middle of a busy agricultural road, isolating dozens of homes. Azem picked me up in his truck and drove me to see it. The sharp smell of freshly turned soil hung in the air. I asked Azem what the Israelis’ justification had been, but he laughed off the question. (When I reached out for comment, the IDF did not provide any.) That afternoon he spent much of his time on his phone, speaking with families blocked in by the dirt. He was doing all he could, he assured them, though it didn’t seem like there was much he could do. When he finally put his phone down, I asked about his plans for Sebastia’s future. “There is no time for future plans,” he said. “First, I build it, then they knock it down, then I build it again.” 

Azem told me that in May 2023, Israeli forces showed up at his home at night, locked his wife and children in a separate room, and presented him with a summons to appear at the police station at the Ariel Settlement. (Though I saw the summons, the IDF declined to answer my questions about the incident.) According to an ICA spokesperson, the mayor was summoned over a newly opened road in Area C that damaged ancient burial caves. But as Azem pointed out, and satellite imagery confirms, the road had existed since at least 1997, and had recently been paved. Moreover, Azem claimed that at the Ariel Settlement, the ICA’s Deputy Head Archaeological Officer Benny Har-Even warned him that he would be arrested if his town conducted work in or around any of its heritage sites, including those in Area B. (An ICA spokesperson confirmed that the meeting with Har-Even occurred, but declined to answer questions about the warning.) Azem was then arrested in November 2023. He alleged he was detained at gunpoint, handcuffed and blindfolded, thrown on the floor of a jeep, and dropped off on a dark military road. The IDF declined to comment, and Azem said he was given no explanation for the arrest.

Azem is a sturdy 49-year-old man with a thick, graying mustache on a weathered face. He looks the part of a politician, dressed in typical mayoral attire: a carefully pressed gray suit, oxford shirts, earthy sweaters. When we spoke in his office, portraits of former and current Palestinian Authority presidents Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas peered down from behind his desk, and Al Jazeera was playing on the television over the conference table, sharing one of the first reports of children starving to death in Gaza. 

In 2021, Azem told Ha’aretz, “There is nothing in Tel Sebastia related to the history of the Jews or Israel.” When I asked him about that comment, he explained how politically difficult it was to acknowledge Jewish heritage in the area. “When we try to develop anything in Sebastia, the occupation may come in at any moment and accuse us of destroying Jewish history,” he said. In his view, the ancient peoples living in Sebastia, of all religions, were ancestors of its current inhabitants. He said he’s been unable to conduct repairs on the Roman columns for years, and “they’ve threatened to arrest anyone who touches them.” He added, “Who is really destroying history?”

 

When Azhari and I visited Sebastia’s forum, the Roman archaeological site that also serves as the anchor of the town’s civic life, children hopped from block to block. Two sweaty teenagers in gym clothes stopped to greet me, assuring me that peaceful visitors from anywhere in the world were welcome. Just then, Azhari received a Telegram message from a community member alerting him of the IDF’s arrival, and within seconds, multiple jeeps sped into the forum. Masked soldiers charged out, cocked their rifles, and aimed them at the four of us. One pointed the barrel of his gun toward me and shouted, “What the fuck are you doing here?” Azhari answered for me: “Tourist! He’s an American tourist!” They gave us five seconds to leave the forum, keeping their guns trained on us as we hurried to Azhari’s car with our arms raised. (In response to my questions about this incident, an IDF spokesperson said only that the army “has been required to operate in civilian environments due to the nefarious use by terrorist organizations of civilian infrastructure and local residents themselves as human shields.”)

To get a better sense of the quotidian violence residents of Sebastia face, I talked to Nemer Ghazal, who said he was shot in the thigh as a teenager during a protest, and Mofeed Shihab, who said his left leg was shot off while he was walking home from school in 2009. “I felt like I was set on fire,” he told me. I also met a seventeen-year-old named Nawar, who hasn’t been able to play soccer or concentrate in school since he was shot in the thigh while picking up lunch for his family. (I am withholding the last names of minors for their protection.) While we spoke, his friend Islam walked by and waved me off when I offered him a seat. “He can’t sit,” Azhari said. “They shot him in the ass in November.” 

The mayor’s children have their own way of dealing with the violence: over coffee and cookies in their living room, they reenacted for me the night the Israeli forces came into their home to issue their father the summons. Azem’s twin fourteen-year-old sons laughed, ran outside, then pounded on the door. As Azem mimed rubbing sleep from his eyes, the twins burst in, pointing finger guns, while their six-year-old sister rolled on the floor giggling. During the performance, real gunshots sounded, and Azem’s phone started ringing. It was the news that soldiers had shot Ayman Shaer, the 27-year-old construction worker. 

Less than eight months earlier, the town had experienced its greatest shock in living memory. On July 21, 2023, a squadron of soldiers opened fire on the car of eighteen-year-old accounting student Fawzi Makhalfeh as he was driving to his father’s plastics factory to warm up the machines. They killed Makhalfeh and injured Mohammad Mukheimar, his best friend since childhood, who was in the passenger seat. “I will never be happy again,” Mukheimer, who was shot in the arm, told me. After the killing, soldiers sprayed tear gas at the gathering crowd, some of whom hurled stones back. Skull fragments and brain matter were found on the road several meters from where Makhalfeh was shot, according to Azem. Makhalfeh’s family said that hospital workers removed fifty bullets from his body. 

Hours after the shooting, the IDF tweeted that soldiers had “neutralized” a driver engaged in “a car ramming attempt.” Military officials never produced any evidence to back up this allegation, and the Israeli human rights NGO B’Tselem found that there was “no reason” for the shooting. In a comment to me, the IDF repeated the line about the car-ramming, but when I spoke with a settler archaeologist, Yair Elmakias, in February, I heard an altogether different story. A doctoral student at Ariel University, one of the primary institutions that conducts archaeological work in the West Bank, Elmakias had recently returned from fighting in Gaza. He’d heard from a military official, he told me, that the shooting of Makhalfeh had been a mistake — an admission the IDF had never publicly made, and declined to comment on to me. Still, Elmakias seemed to blame the shooting on the locals’ hostility toward Israeli visitors to the archaeological sites. “If you throw rocks at them, if you mean by that you don’t want them to come, you need to face the consequences,” Elmakias said. “Maybe a soldier will shoot you.” (To reach Sebastia’s main archaeological site in Area C, Israeli visitors must cross the busy forum in Area B, where Palestinians sometimes greet them with stones. Azem said this only occurs when visitors are accompanied by belligerent soldiers, and that there is no armed resistance in Sebastia.)

The settlers I spoke with often invoked the specter of Palestinian violence to explain why military and bureaucratic force so often accompanies what they frame as a quest to reclaim their heritage. To cross over from Sebastia to Shavei Shomron, I was transported to a tucked-away backroad by a Palestinian driver, dropped off like a bag of drugs, and picked up by my settler tour guide, Miri Bar-Tzion — a ninety-minute journey to cover approximately a thousand meters as the crow flies. On a hilltop overlooking Sebastia, Bar-Tzion flipped through a binder documenting Jewish history in Sebastia, including a tax bill with ancient Hebrew lettering and ivory carvings that supposedly belonged to King Omri. She was showing me these objects in order to establish Israel’s right to Sebastia. But whatever role archaeological narratives play in justifying territorial claims, it’s guns and power that enforce them — also in the binder was a famous 1975 photograph of religious Zionists celebrating the agreement that allowed them to move to Palestinian land the IDF had seized near Sebastia.

After we finished our history lesson, Bar-Tzion introduced me to Yair and Hen Weisz, the couple that manages security for Itamar, a nearby settlement of 1,500 residents. “Terrorism needs infrastructure,” Yair explained. It’s much easier to catch a terrorist, he said, if a city’s ten exits are reduced to one. The pair’s explanation for the violence I’d witnessed was simple: “It’s a war zone.” I checked to make sure we were still talking about Sebastia, which I’d emphasized was a quiet, nonviolent town. “Yes,” Yair said. “Why are you so surprised?” Hen cited a 2011 incident in which two Palestinians, who weren’t from Sebastia, breached Itamar’s gates and killed five members of the same family. More recently, October 7 had strengthened Yair’s resolve. “It was like the Holocaust on steroids,” he told me. “Now, we are the strong ones, but we still remember what happens when we’re weak.” As far as the future was concerned, the couple’s message to the Palestinians was clear. “If you want to stay here, and you don’t accept me as a landlord,” Hen said, “we have to fight, we’ll fight hard, and we’ll fight to death.”

 

In June, Israel’s Security Cabinet approved Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s proposal to extend the ICA’s authority over heritage sites from Area C into Area B, effectively erasing the lines on Ghazal’s map. Smotrich, who was granted sweeping powers over the West Bank in 2023, had previously promised to “establish facts on the ground that will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian terrorist state,” dropping the pretense that Israel’s occupying presence in the West Bank is intended to be temporary. A little more than a week after the cabinet decision, Israel’s Ministerial Committee on Legislation gave preliminary approval to a bill transferring oversight of West Bank archaeology from the Israeli Civil Administration to the Israel Antiquities Authority, the body responsible for sites within Israel’s 1948 borders — a step toward the far-right goal of dismantling the ICA piece by piece until the separation of governance across the Green Line disappears, turning the West Bank into de facto Israeli territory.

These new developments represent a bold gambit engineered to unravel key components of the most significant peace deals between Israel and Palestine, the Oslo Accords and the Camp David Accords — strengthening Israel’s control of the West Bank while setting the stage for annexation. Donald Trump’s return to the White House seems likely to embolden the settler movement further. On November 11, Smotrich called Trump’s election an “important opportunity” to “apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements in Judea and Samaria” and said that he had no doubt that President Trump “will support the State of Israel in this move.” Smotrich is probably right — in November, Trump nominated former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel. In 2017, Huckabee said, “There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria.”

Israeli archaeologists who flout international law by operating in the occupied West Bank are shunned by much of the global field. Some of their peers inside the Green Line, including the head of the Antiquities Authority, have opposed the plan to transfer oversight of West Bank archaeology away from the ICA — out of concern for their own interests, according to Arad. He said his establishment colleagues understand that erasing “the separation between legitimate archaeology in Israel and non-legitimate archaeology in the West Bank” would mean international organizations’ “boycotting the Israeli Antiquities Authority.” Funding could dry up, and even Israeli archaeologists unwilling to cross the Green Line might be barred from attending conferences and publishing in scientific journals.

For decades, mainstream Israeli archaeologists have allowed the far-right to use their discipline as a weapon for chipping away at the brittle veneer of laws protecting Palestinians. It’s a familiar story in Israel: a powerful group of cynical actors aggressively seeks to oppress and displace Palestinians; a left-wing minority belatedly emerges to protest in vain; meanwhile, the majority of the population carries on as if nothing is wrong. And by the time they recognize the threat they’ve nurtured within their society, it’s too late to stop it.

In July, the IDF issued an order to seize 1,300 square meters of Palestinian land around the contentious hilltop flagpole in Sebastia for unspecified “military needs.” The head of infrastructure for the Israeli Civil Administration reassured a committee of concerned Knesset members that an Israeli flag would soon replace the unsightly Palestinian one. Assaf Cohen, an aide to Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu, told the Financial Times that the goal is to convert Sebastia into “a tourist site accessible to all the people of Israel,” complete with a “gigantic” flagpole. Elmakias approved. “It’s very simple,” he said. “It’s symbolic to put the Palestinian flag over the palace of the biblical king of Israel.” I asked him directly if the land grab and new legislation were part of a larger project to erase the Green Line and break down the difference between Israel and the West Bank. “We are going step by step,” he said, “doing what you just described, making life in Judea and Samaria more similar to life inside Israel.” 

Aharon Tavger, another settler archaeologist at Ariel University, contends that the law around the occupied territories has never made much sense. “If we accept the recognition of Israel — the Israeli state,” Tavger said, “because of the historical right, or the connection of the people of Israel to the land, there is no difference between Tel Aviv and Sebastia.” He continued, “And I can say even the opposite: The heartland of Israel, of the ancient Jewish land, is Judea and Samaria — the West Bank — much more than Tel Aviv.” The whole argument against excavating in the West Bank, in his view, raises a thornier question. 

“In 1948, Israel also occupied territory,” he said. “So what’s the difference?”

The routine. The 6am alarm, working 7-3, dinner at 5:30., the dishes, laundry, bed at 9:30. Try to make time to learn and exercise. Maybe do some stuff on the weekend. 

But I’m realizing how I’m working for the weekends. I’ve become a cliche. All I look forward to are my days off and then I get there and it hits me what my life is like. 
I honestly don’t see the point in any of it. 

And the moments that are an escape from it all, the long weekend camping, the week long visit with old friends, hiking a great trail, seeing a great sunset, a great cup of coffee and a good book… it’s not enough for some reason, like it’s frosting on the cake, but I want something more substantial in my life. 

I can’t turn to things that numb me anymore but I don’t know how I’m gonna do this another 30 plus years.
