Is it the climate change?,"It is not only my opinion. I could say the same for Kenyan coffee also. But let‚Äôs speak about Ethiopia. I love the taste of good Ethiopian coffees. But it is meanwhile so difficult to find a really good one. Chelchele is not like before, Shakiso Sidamo is not like before, the last good Harar coffee I drank is 15 years ago ( ok, I know the reason is mainly export of khat to Yemen which brings more money than coffee cultivation ). 5 years ago I had a great no name washed Yirgacheffe from a German roaster, the R√∂start in Bochum, and paid 5,40 ‚Ç¨ for a 250 g bag!! It was a fantastic Yirgacheffe with all that characteristics we appreciate for. Nowadays? Good Yirgacheffe disappeared or became very rare. I ordered Gesha Village from Tanat (formerly Kawa, very good French roaster) last year, paid really a lot of money, at about 30‚Ç¨ for a 200 g bag and it was nothing special‚Ä¶This year it is the same price for 100d, I did not buy of course. The Yirgacheffe of 5,40 ‚Ç¨ was much better. But even that specific roaster, R√∂start, does not offer so good quality of Yirgacheffe any more. 
Maybe the best coffee I have drank in my life was 2008, it was the legendary ‚ÄúMisty Valley‚Äù from the farmer Abdullah Bagersh in Yirgacheffe Aricha. Any efforts in the next years to find this specific coffee ended in failure. There are in the market some roasters who sell Yirgacheffe Aricha or even ‚Äúmisty valley‚Äù but it is no way that fantastic quality I had the pleasure to have 2008. Since that time I am like somebody who is looking for his lost love‚Ä¶
I buy coffee from very good roasters mainly in Germany, Netherlands, France. I use Hario V60 every day many times. 
I am only a consumer of good coffee and do not know details of the coffee market. My opinion is that the climate change is the main reason for the worsening quality of Ethiopian (and not only) coffee. Maybe there are some other reasons like political decisions or situations, financial issues, costs of production etc‚Ä¶
What do you think? Do you have the same issue like me? What is the reason? Can I find this quality of Misty valley coffee again or is it a lost case? ",0,1752444325.0,pourover,1,0.5,False

Why $100 in $BRO (0x3081220ab18ddc56d8ee8f2aad68108a69f18d8a) Might Be the Smartest Dumb Bet You Ever Make

Let‚Äôs be real for a second. This is the meme coin space. It‚Äôs high risk. Most of us have gotten rugged, chased candles, or round-tripped a 10x back to breakeven. But every now and then, something drops that actually checks every box‚Äînot just vibes, but real technical, structural, and psychological advantages. That‚Äôs $BRO.

TL;DR
Contract: 0x3081220ab18ddc56d8ee8f2aad68108a69f18d8a
Launched ~24 hours ago
Already built a floor without blowing off top
Still under $2M market cap = massive upside
Devs are active, meme game strong, tokenomics tight
Risk-reward? Outrageous. $100 here is like buying Shiba before Binance



Time + Price = Opportunity

Most meme coins explode and die in the first 12‚Äì18 hours. They pump straight up, then dump even harder. Not $BRO. This thing ran early, then based, and is now coiling for another leg. That‚Äôs the same structure SHIB, PEPE, and WIF showed before their first real exponential impulse.

Reminder:
	‚Ä¢	SHIB dropped 75% before it 1000x‚Äôd
	‚Ä¢	PEPE lost 68% before catching fire
	‚Ä¢	WIF went totally sideways for 3 weeks before melting faces

$BRO? We‚Äôve barely started.



The $100-to-Millions Math Actually Checks Out

Let‚Äôs not pretend this is a blue-chip portfolio play. This is a moonshot. But the math makes sense:
	‚Ä¢	At $1.8M market cap, a 100x = $180M
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs peanuts in meme world (WIF hit $4B+, PEPE hit $1.5B+)
	‚Ä¢	A $100 bet becomes $10,000 at 100x
	‚Ä¢	$100 becomes $1,000,000 at 10,000x (yes, SHIB did more than this)

If you‚Äôre spending $20 on coffee, not tossing $100 here is almost irresponsible.


Fundamentals in a Meme Coin?? Yup.

It‚Äôs rare‚Äîbut $BRO isn‚Äôt just vapor. Here‚Äôs what sets it apart:
	‚Ä¢	Locked liquidity
	‚Ä¢	Ownership renounced
	‚Ä¢	Real community forming fast (not just bots or paid shills)
	‚Ä¢	Chart shows actual buyers, not just launch hype
	‚Ä¢	Early meme culture forming around ‚ÄúPump Master Flex‚Äù and BRO vibes

This isn‚Äôt some zero-utility Chinese contract with 99% supply in dev wallets. This is organic, clean, and technically gorgeous.

It‚Äôs Early‚Ä¶ But Not Too Early

You don‚Äôt want to be the first 10 buys‚Äîthat‚Äôs rug territory.

But you also don‚Äôt want to be the guy buying at $80M thinking it‚Äôs still ‚Äúearly.‚Äù

Right now is that sweet spot. It‚Äôs young, liquid, stable, and coiled. The kind of entry point that, in hindsight, looks obvious‚Äîbut only to the brave and smart.




If you‚Äôre reading this‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre early.
Buy some $BRO.
Hold.
Let them FOMO in later.

Ever wondered why some ebook landing pages convert like crazy while others barely get a second glance? You're not alone! The secret isn't just about having great content ‚Äì it's about knowing exactly how to present it.

Picture this: You've just finished writing your masterpiece. Your ebook is ready to change lives, solve problems, and maybe even make you some serious money. But here's the thing ‚Äì without a killer landing page, even the best ebook in the world might sit there collecting digital dust.

That's where the magic happens. A well-crafted landing page doesn't just showcase your ebook; it practically sells itself. We're talking about pages that turn casual browsers into eager buyers, skeptics into believers, and visitors into loyal customers.

**Ready to transform your ebook marketing game?** [Check out how systeme io can help you build stunning landing pages that convert](https://www.marlenekonu.com/sio). Want to see real results? [Read this honest 6-year review of systeme io](https://www.reddit.com/r/systeme_io/comments/x3nkgz/systeme_io_review_my_honest_thought_after_1_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and discover [exclusive lifetime deals with bonuses](https://www.reddit.com/r/systeme_io/comments/1frpj1r/systeme_io_lifetime_deal_use_this_systemeio_promo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that'll blow your mind!

# Why Your Ebook Needs Its Own Landing Page (And Not Just Any Page!)

Let's be real ‚Äì throwing your ebook on Amazon and hoping for the best is like fishing with a safety pin. Sure, you might catch something, but wouldn't you rather use proper bait?

Your ebook landing page is your digital sales assistant. It works 24/7, never takes a coffee break, and doesn't judge customers for buying at 3 AM in their pajamas. But here's what makes it truly powerful: it captures leads while it sells.

Think about it. When someone downloads your ebook, they're not just getting content ‚Äì they're raising their hand and saying, ""I'm interested in what you have to offer."" That's marketing gold right there!

# The Hidden Benefits You're Missing

Most people think landing pages are just fancy download buttons. Wrong! A strategic ebook landing page becomes your secret weapon for:

* **Building trust** before asking for contact information
* **Demonstrating expertise** through valuable content previews
* **Creating urgency** that makes people act now, not later
* **Generating qualified leads** who actually want what you're selling
* **Ranking higher** in search results for your target keywords

Here's something most marketers don't tell you: the best landing pages don't feel like landing pages at all. They feel like conversations with a trusted friend who happens to have exactly what you need.

# The Psychology Behind Pages That Convert

Want to know a secret? People don't buy ebooks ‚Äì they buy transformations. They buy solutions. They buy the promise of a better tomorrow.

Your job isn't to list features like ""120 pages"" or ""10 chapters."" Your job is to paint a picture of their life after they've absorbed your knowledge. What will they be able to do? How will they feel? What problems will disappear?

# The Power of Emotional Triggers

Smart marketers know that humans make decisions with their hearts and justify them with their heads. That's why the most effective ebook landing pages tap into these psychological triggers:

**Social Proof That Actually Matters** Instead of generic testimonials, showcase specific results. ""This cookbook helped me lose 15 pounds in 30 days"" beats ""Great book!"" every single time. Numbers tell stories, and stories sell ebooks.

**Scarcity Without the Sleaze** Limited-time offers work because they mirror real life. Opportunities don't wait forever. But here's the key: your scarcity must be genuine. False urgency kills trust faster than a bad first impression.

**The Authority Advantage** People buy from experts, not strangers. If you've been featured in major publications, worked with big brands, or have impressive credentials, don't hide them. Authority builds confidence, and confidence converts browsers into buyers.

**The Freebie Factor** Free samples work in grocery stores, and they work online too. A free chapter, bonus material, or complementary mini-course can tip the scales in your favor. Give them a taste of your expertise, and they'll hunger for more.

# Designing for Conversion, Not Just Beauty

Pretty pages are nice, but profitable pages are better. The most successful ebook landing pages follow a simple principle: every element should either help convince visitors to convert or get out of the way.

# The Distraction Elimination Method

Here's a brutal truth: every clickable element on your landing page is a potential escape route. Navigation menus, social media links, footer links ‚Äì they're all conversion killers in disguise.

Your landing page should be like a funnel, not a maze. Guide visitors from curiosity to conversion without giving them seventeen ways to leave. The only clicks that matter are the ones that lead to your opt-in form or purchase button.

# Content That Convinces

For free ebooks, keep it simple. Show the value, highlight the benefits, and make it easy to download. People expect less friction for free content, but they still want to know what they're getting.

Paid ebooks require more persuasion. You're asking for real money, so you need to provide real value proof. This means:

* **Detailed benefit explanations** that connect features to outcomes
* **Social proof** from real customers with real results
* **Preview content** that showcases your expertise
* **Clear value propositions** that justify the investment
* **Risk reversal** like money-back guarantees

# The Form Factor

Long forms kill conversions faster than popup ads. For most ebook downloads, you need just two pieces of information: name and email address. That's it.

Why? Because you're starting a relationship, not conducting a census. You can learn more about your subscribers later through email marketing and engagement tracking.

# Real-World Examples That Actually Work

Let's look at some landing pages that get it right (and wrong) so you can learn from their successes and mistakes.

# The Minimalist Approach

Some of the highest-converting ebook landing pages are surprisingly simple. They feature clean designs, plenty of white space, and laser-focused messaging. These pages work because they eliminate decision fatigue ‚Äì visitors see exactly what they need to do next.

The key is balancing simplicity with persuasion. Too simple, and you don't provide enough value proof. Too complex, and you overwhelm visitors with choices.

# The Content-Rich Strategy

For high-ticket ebooks (think $50-$200), more content often means more conversions. These pages might include detailed descriptions, author bios, table of contents, sample chapters, and extensive social proof.

The secret sauce? Organization. Content-rich pages work when information is presented in digestible chunks with clear visual hierarchy. Break up text with headers, bullet points, and visual elements that guide the eye naturally down the page.

# The Common Mistakes to Avoid

We've analyzed hundreds of ebook landing pages, and the same mistakes keep appearing:

* **Buried download buttons** that require scrolling to find
* **Vague benefit statements** that don't connect to real outcomes
* **Too many form fields** that create unnecessary friction
* **Missing social proof** that leaves visitors questioning credibility
* **Unclear value propositions** that don't differentiate from competitors

# The Technical Side of Landing Page Success

Here's where most entrepreneurs get stuck. You know what makes a great landing page, but how do you actually build one without becoming a coding expert?

# The Platform Decision

Choosing the right platform can make or break your landing page success. You need something that's powerful enough to handle complex designs but simple enough to use without a computer science degree.

Modern page builders offer drag-and-drop functionality, mobile optimization, and integration with email marketing tools. The best platforms also provide templates specifically designed for ebook promotion, saving you hours of design work.

# Speed and Mobile Optimization

Your landing page could be the most persuasive piece of content ever written, but if it loads slowly or looks terrible on mobile devices, you'll lose visitors before they even read your headline.

Page speed affects both user experience and search engine rankings. A one-second delay in loading time can reduce conversions by 7%. That's real money walking out the door.

# Integration Capabilities

Your landing page shouldn't exist in isolation. It needs to connect with your email marketing platform, analytics tools, and customer relationship management system. Seamless integration ensures you can track performance and nurture leads effectively.

# Advanced Conversion Optimization Strategies

Once you've mastered the basics, these advanced techniques can take your conversions to the next level:

# The Preview Strategy

Give visitors a taste of your content through sample chapters, page previews, or bonus materials. This builds trust and demonstrates value before asking for commitment.

# The Urgency Amplifier

Create genuine urgency through limited-time bonuses, early-bird pricing, or exclusive access periods. The key is authenticity ‚Äì fake urgency backfires spectacularly.

# The Social Proof Multiplier

Beyond basic testimonials, consider featuring:

* **Success stories** with specific metrics and outcomes
* **Media mentions** that boost your authority
* **User-generated content** that shows real people using your ebook
* **Download counters** that demonstrate popularity

# The Follow-Up Sequence

Your landing page is just the beginning. Plan your entire funnel from first visit to final purchase. What happens after someone downloads your free ebook? How do you nurture them toward paid products?

# Measuring What Matters

You can't optimize what you don't measure. The most important metrics for ebook landing pages include:

* **Conversion rate**: The percentage of visitors who complete your desired action
* **Traffic sources**: Where your highest-converting visitors come from
* **Time on page**: How long visitors engage with your content
* **Bounce rate**: The percentage of visitors who leave immediately
* **Email open rates**: How your new subscribers engage with follow-up content

# The Testing Mindset

Even the best landing pages can be improved. Split testing different headlines, images, form placements, and calls-to-action reveals what resonates most with your audience.

Start with big changes that could make significant differences ‚Äì testing button colors probably won't move the needle as much as testing entirely different value propositions.

# The All-in-One Solution

Building high-converting ebook landing pages doesn't have to be complicated. With the right platform, you can create professional pages that capture leads and drive sales without technical expertise.

Systeme io provides everything you need: drag-and-drop page builders, email marketing automation, sales funnel creation, and detailed analytics. Their templates are specifically designed for digital product promotion, and their free plan lets you test everything before committing.

The platform handles the technical complexity while you focus on what matters most: creating compelling content that converts visitors into customers.

# Your Next Steps to Landing Page Success

Ready to create your first high-converting ebook landing page? Here's your action plan:

1. **Define your target audience** and their primary pain points
2. **Craft a compelling value proposition** that differentiates your ebook
3. **Choose your platform** and select an appropriate template
4. **Write persuasive copy** that focuses on benefits, not features
5. **Add social proof** that builds trust and credibility
6. **Optimize for mobile** and test loading speeds
7. **Set up tracking** to monitor performance and conversions
8. **Plan your follow-up sequence** for new subscribers
9. **Launch and test** different elements to improve results
10. **Scale what works** and eliminate what doesn't

Remember, the best landing page is the one that connects with your audience and drives real results. Start with solid fundamentals, test continuously, and always prioritize user experience over flashy design.

Your ebook deserves a landing page that sells as hard as your content delivers. The only question is: are you ready to build it?

I (30F) recently went through a breakup with someone (30M) I was with for a year who truly my best friend, my safe place, the most generous and emotionally available partner I‚Äôve ever had. We are no contact, he told me never to contact him again. From day one, it felt natural. We were ourselves completely with each other. He would fly across the country to see me without hesitation. I never doubted how much he loved me, and I‚Äôve never felt so prioritized in a relationship.

But a few months ago, he ended it suddenly.
We had been navigating a long-distance relationship and having hard conversations about our future: where we‚Äôd live, the fact that he doesn‚Äôt want kids, and whether our lifestyles truly aligned. I was trying to be honest about how hard it would be to leave my community, hobbies, giving up the idea of motherhood and future dreams behind to move. He knew I was struggling, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to end so suddenly.

He canceled a trip to visit me, refused to talk, and ultimately ended the relationship via text. No closure, no face-to-face conversation after a year together. I was blindsided and heartbroken, again - we had broken up about 6 months into our relationship over similar reasons in a similar way, he blocked me on everything, and a month later he wrote me a letter and texted me he regretted everything and I could be his person and we got back together for 5 months until the 2nd breakup.

Even though I was hesitant about uprooting my life, I would have met him halfway, or was willing to give up important parts of myself because what we had was so special and safe. I thought we‚Äôd keep working on it. But he gave up. And now, over a month after the breakup questioning everything.

I went on a coffee date recently and found myself disappointment that this new guy didn‚Äôt even pay for my drink, meanwhile, my ex used to fly across the country, bought me thoughtful gifts, and would constantly pay for me. I miss the way he loved me. I miss being someone‚Äôs priority. I miss the comfort and closeness we had from day one.

Since the breakup, I enrolled in grad school and adopted a cat, and continued enjoying time with friends and my hobbies, all things I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do had I moved and/or followed his life, but yet, I‚Äôm still sad. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never be loved like he loved me again. Someone so dedicated, loving, caring, and thoughtful is hard to find these days, and the first date I went on after the breakup really discouraged me.


If he really loved me the way he said he did, why wasn‚Äôt that enough? Why couldn‚Äôt he be flexible? Was I too scared? Did I not try hard enough? Did I lose the right person?

If anyone has gone through a breakup that wasn‚Äôt about a lack of love but about misalignment of life plans, how did you move forward? Did you find someone better when you didn‚Äôt think it was possible?",0,1752443641.0,ExNoContact,0,0.5,False

I hope you all enjoy this, and it will be posted to AO3 one day with extended scenes (if I get around to it, of course.).

  
Characters:

  
Yuta = Yuna  
Maki = Masaki

  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Her lip quivered as she felt him pin her down against the mattress. Her body soft in his grasp like a putty, while his fingers gripped her thighs like putty. His hips pushed up against her, and his gaze bore into her soul. Those golden eyes shot sharply into hers, making her feel even more queasy and weak.



""M...Masaki..."" She whimpered, the heat of his dick and the strings of precum on it's tip lacing her inner thigh..



He let out a dark chuckle, his voice laced with dominance and desire. His thumbs slowly rubbed on the skin between her inner thigh and her pelvis, while he leaned forward to whisper down to her. Something that proved way harder due to her height, even sprawled out on her back like this.

  
""Yuna."" He groaned, his nose running along her neck. When her hips started bucking against his, he growled and pushed her down with his hand.

  
""Yuna!"" He barked, stifling her movements. His eyes gazed down into hers, hungry and demanding. ""I didn't say you can move, and I didn't give you permission to speed things up. You said you wanted me to be gentle with you, right?"".

  
She nodded, her skin tense from his tight hold. Any harsher of a grip and her leg might snap under his thumbs.

  
""Ye....Yeah, Masaki.-san."" She muttered, desperation gripping her heart and the heat between her legs growing by the second. Even when she was pinned down, weak and whimpering like this, she still said his name like a prayer, a gentle whisper laced with syrupy sweetness and perfection. ""I...I just can't...wait..."".

  
His lips ran along the skin of her neck in rough kisses and his tongue traced over the faded marks of their last time together, while he lined the tip of his throbbing shaft up under her. Each little touch held such potency it crumbled her walls, and every second of teasing pushed her further and further to the edge.

  
""Masaki..."" She called out, tilting her head and trembling. Her fingers reached to grip firmly onto his shoulders, digging into the powerful muscles and her legs opened up on his touches.

  
Slowly, delicious inch by delicious inch of his cock pushed into her, sending jolts of pain ricketing into her bones.

  
""Oh....Oh god, Masaki!"" She moaned, resisting the urge to snap her legs shut on his hips. Her fingers dug into her bedsheets while her lip hung open and loose. ""Masaki! Masaki, Masaki, Masaki...Fuuuck!!!!"".

  
""Mmmmghn, Yuna."" He groaned, the feeling of being squeezed by her inner walls pleasant and relieving. ""Fuck, you're being such a good girl."".

  
He sat up, grappling her hip and thigh with his hands. The calloused skin of his burns, mixed with the softer touches of his smooth skin made the grab feel that much better. The dual sensations of rough and soft on her skin sending tingles down her spine.

  
And then, his thrusting began.

  
""M......MASAKI!!!"" She wailed, her back arching off the bed. If she had felt wrecked before, his movements made her feel ten times worse. Each slam of his hips shook her legs and stirred her insides. Each thrust rocked her body, making her eyes roll back in her skull and her legs quake. ""Masaki!!! Masa!!! Masa!!! Maaasakiiii!!!"".

  
""Yeah, like that pretty girl."" He grunted, pounding her pussy hard. He held her hips harshly, fingers clawing into the skin and feeling the curve of her bone. His body moved with such power. His cock forced itself deep into her, stretching her inner walls like dough. ""Say my name, as I fuck your brains out. Keep spilling those pretty sounds from your mouth, slut!"".

  
""Maaasaki.....Maaaaasaaaki....."" She whined, drool pouring from the corner of her lips. Her body became limper and limper, yielding to his dominance like a puppet.  Each pump, each slam, each THRUST cracked another part of her psyche and unwound another string in the coil of her thoughts.  ""Masaki! Masaki! Maaaasaaakiii!!!"".

  
Every single moment of pounding melted her mind like butter.

  
And then, when the sensations hit too much, her whole body shook.

  
""Ahhhh..."" She let out weakly, her orgasm crashing through her. It dirtied her, making the bedsheets under her become tainted, and covered the entirety of his rapidly pumping dick. The slickness made him move faster, laughs escaping his lips.

  
""Good girl."" He praised, thumbs drawing around her waist, and fiddling with her back. ""Cum just like that. I plan to fuck you for hours, Yu\~"".

  
""Maaaasaki...."" She whined, chanting his name in a similar vein to how a sorcerer would use chants to increase their technique's effectiveness.

  
""Masakai! Masaki! Masaki!"" She chanted, repeating his name like a dying prayer. Her body jolted at each thrust, with her hips feeling soreness upon the impact of every connecting slam.

  
""Mmmngh, yeah, like that babe."" He groaned, his hands moving down to her thighs. The way his fingers dug into her skin left deep, angry red marks and the way he praised her sent shivers down her spine. ""You feel so good. Fuck..."".

  
""Maaasakiiii...."" She weakly moaned, her voice cracking. His pounding was making every part of her sore. It was only by the thinnest strings she held out enough thought to pump her body with the reversed curse technique so that her hips wouldn't snap, and even that was proving to be difficult.

  
Just like the unwinding of a spring, she came again. Her eyes rolled back in her skull. Her legs trembled, knees pushing up into his sides. Her hips ground against his as he sped up his fucking, making him groan in estacy.

  
""Fuck, Yuna!"" He gasped, pumping into her faster. ""Oh, I'm so close. Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this a lot..."".

  
Licking his lips, he lifted her hips, fucking her even harder at this better angle. The position made her scream, a loud, blood curdled screaming chant of his name.

  
""MASAKI!! MASAKI!!! MASAKI!!!!"" She screeched, the only word on her mind, in her thoughts and out her mouth being his name. ""MASAKI!!! MASAKI!!! MASAKI MASAKI MAAASAAAAKIIIIII!!!!!"".

  
""Fuck yeah, baby. Say my name."" He ordered, continuing to relentlessly drill into her. His dick felt like it was burning from how fast and hard he pushed it in and out of her wet folds, and his hands dug into the muscles of her legs. ""Say my name again and again. Say who you belong to, slut."".

  
""MASAKI!!! MASAKI!!! MASAKI!!!"" She chanted, her voice cracking with each repetition of the word. She was wrapped around his finger, and he knew it. He revelled in that fact, relished it like gold.

  
She was the subject of his spell, caught at the strings of her mind and heart.

  
He was god and she was the puppet upon the strings he twirled.

  
""I'm so close, Yu."" He groaned, picking up the power of his thrusts. Each slam was world shattering, turning her eyes even further back in her skull. ""God, I'm so close...."".

  
His thumbs curled into the gap between her thighs and his waist, prying her legs apart with monstrous strength. She didn't even have the capability to fight back on it, her lips warbling a weak, wanton moan of his name.

  
""Maaasaaakiiii....."".

  
""Fuck, I can't hold it back."" He gasped, sliding his member out of her slick folds, erect and wet. He let it plop onto here pelvis, spray ropes of cum onto her stomach and tits, and even hitting her neck.

  
She could only sit there, her body painted by the essence of his release. His climax didn't last long, but it felt like he was cumming for years on end.

  
""Ma...Masaki..."" She croaked weakly, her fingers loosely twisting into the sheets.

  
He let one final huff, dick plopping onto her thigh. Sweat beads had formed on his forehead, and his shoulders heaved with every breath he took. Even from this angle, he looked heart twistingly hot.

  
""Fuck..."" He muttered, leaning down over her body. His face tilted up as he moved close to her ear.

  
""Use your cursed energy to heal up, and meet me in the shower for round two."" He ordered.

  
Yuna nodded, catching back a hold of her thoughts. Her body felt weak, tainted and broken, but her mind felt bliss. Her entire body felt the cool sensation of reversed curse technique burning through her sore bones and muscles, like icy flames upon beach of glass.

  
And the promise of more....that stirred her on. Her cursed energy surged as her heart beat stupid fast.

  
His lips met hers, kissing her soft but firm. The overwhelming sense of bliss made her shut her eyes, pouring all her energy into the healing while he kissed her.

  
When his body's weight and warmth left her, she was tempted to give a whine. Her mouth hung open and her fingers slowly reached up to try grab him, but the door to the bathroom had already opened.

  
Her arm plopped down on the bed. Her eyes opened, staring at the ceiling.

  
Then, with the speed of a snail, blush creeped up on her face. It covered her red from the neck to the forehead, and from ear to ear.

  
""Oh god..."" She muttered, putting her hands on her face. The feeling of pain was dissipating from her lower body, but her legs still trembled as she sat up. Her mid length, dark hair fell around her in a messy streak, sticking to her sweat slicken neck, back and shoulders. ""Oh god, that felt good...."".

  
Her mind couldn't stop thinking about him. Everytime she thought she knew him well enough to endure his physicality, and also his love.

  
And everytime, she proved herself wrong. His smile, his laugh, his words, his tone....it all drove her into something stupid and sickly. His muscles, his skin, his tone, it all matched up the perfect slots of her heart for a jackpot. It was like a perfect key code he had in his spirit that could open the safe of her thoughts and force his image to override her very senses.

  
Her fingers gripped the bed as she stood, knees shaking. God she was so dirty, and god did she need him again. 

  
""Masaki..."" She murmured in her perfect, softened tone that fit his name like sugar sweetens a black coffee.  Her feet swept along the floor toward the bathroom. Her teeth sucked in air at every step, already feeling the unease of walking creep over her.

  
Her ears picked up on the sound of the shower, making her heart stir on. She wanted to hurry. She wanted to be there with him.

  
She wanted his roughness and his love again.",2,1752443358.0,FreakyKaisen,0,1.0,False

From day one, it felt natural. We were ourselves completely with each other. He would fly across the country to see me without hesitation. I never doubted how much he loved me, and I‚Äôve never felt so prioritized in a relationship.

But a few months ago, he ended it suddenly.
We had been navigating a long-distance relationship and having hard conversations about our future: where we‚Äôd live, the fact that he doesn‚Äôt want kids, and whether our lifestyles truly aligned. I was trying to be honest about how hard it would be to leave my community, hobbies, giving up the idea of motherhood and future dreams behind to move. He knew I was struggling, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to end so suddenly.

He canceled a trip to visit me, refused to talk, and ultimately ended the relationship via text. No closure, no face-to-face conversation after a year together. I was blindsided and heartbroken, again - we had broken up about 6 months into our relationship over similar reasons in a similar way, he blocked me on everything, and a month later he wrote me a letter and texted me he regretted everything and I could be his person and we got back together for 5 months until the 2nd breakup.

Even though I was hesitant about uprooting my life, I would have met him halfway, or was willing to give up important parts of myself because what we had was so special and safe. I thought we‚Äôd keep working on it. But he gave up. And now, over a month after the breakup questioning everything.

I went on a coffee date recently and found myself disappointment that this new guy didn‚Äôt even pay for my drink, meanwhile, my ex used to fly across the country, bought me thoughtful gifts, and would constantly pay for me. I miss the way he loved me. I miss being someone‚Äôs priority. I miss the comfort and closeness we had from day one.

Since the breakup, I enrolled in grad school and adopted a cat, and continued enjoying time with friends and my hobbies, all things I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do had I moved and/or followed his life, but yet, I‚Äôm still sad. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never be loved like he loved me again. Someone so dedicated, loving, caring, and thoughtful is hard to find these days, and the first date I went on after the breakup really discouraged me.


If he really loved me the way he said he did, why wasn‚Äôt that enough? Why couldn‚Äôt he be flexible? Was I too scared? Did I not try hard enough? Did I lose the right person?

If anyone has gone through a breakup that wasn‚Äôt about a lack of love but about misalignment of life plans, how did you move forward? Did you find someone better when you didn‚Äôt think it was possible?",1,1752443160.0,Codependency,0,1.0,False

She lost her husband of almost 50 years a little over a year ago. She's really struggling. I knew that but today she shared with me that she needs to talk with someone, and she wants me to help her find a psychologist.  She says there's something inside of her, a heaviness that she can't seem to get rid of. Months ago she had confided in me that she had guilt,, he did not want to go through chemo, he just wanted to go back to be with extended family but she wanted him to do treatment. He lived about 8 or 9 months and for a while it looked like he was going to make it. He was the kindest sweetest man you'd ever want to meet. I never once saw him in a bad mood, he was always so welcoming. Even when I went to see him in the hospital he was laying in bed on oxygen ...he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee... forever the host! I actually didn't know him that well and I still cried my eyes out at his funeral. 

There's a little bit of a language barrier and there's a generation gap but I sincerely want to help her.
To be honest I don't know her that well either..we frequented their establishment and have been calling on her more since his passing because I've been worried about her. I truly hate to see her sad. I know her husband would want people watching over her and I would do anything for these two kind souls, one living and one passed. 

The thing is, I have had the worst luck with psychologist since before the pandemic. And she's asking me to help her find someone? I'm sorry but I've really lost faith in the profession. A few weeks ago I just dumped the fifth one in 5 years. They don't even listen to you, they don't show up for appointments and then bill you for that appointment, they're talking to you while they're walking down the hall or they're driving, one dumped on me for about 20 minutes about HER divorce! I'm not kidding. 

What can I do to help her? I'm actually not very good at talking to people. Maybe the best I can do is give her a big hug which seems pretty lame.

I'll take any advice at all. Thank you!

PS I had no idea what tag to apply, maybe I'm in the wrong forum? I don't understand Reddit.

I started Trintellix at 5 mg the first week of May and then went up to 10 mg the first week of June. It‚Äôs now July 12th, so I‚Äôve been on it for about 10 weeks total, and 5‚Äì6 weeks at the higher dose.

I really wanted to give this med a fair chance, so I quit drinking, smoking weed, and even stopped coffee ‚Äî hoping it would help. But ever since I made those changes, the brain fog/motivation/cognitive issues have actually gotten worse.

I also stopped a bunch of other meds in May, so maybe my body is still adjusting. But right now, I‚Äôm really struggling with day-to-day life. I know I‚Äôm a smart person without meds, but on Trintellix, it feels like my brain just won‚Äôt turn on. Even writing this post is hard for me, and that‚Äôs not normal. 

I‚Äôve had success with Prozac in the past, but it eventually stopped working, and have tried many meds since without success. Mainly because the onboarding sucks and I don‚Äôt see benefits in the first 1-2 months. I feel so lost on what to do. 

I‚Äôve heard you‚Äôre supposed to wait 8‚Äì12 weeks, and I‚Äôm around week 10 on 10 mg‚Äî but I honestly don‚Äôt know if I should keep pushing through or stop.

Does it get better, and if so WHEN?",1,1752442537.0,trintellix,0,1.0,False

So I decided to sleep in because I knew I'd I went id be non functional. Not so much in the taking photo sense but in the observational sense
Luckily I knew where the shuttles came from so after the race I headed down to the coffee shop. With the shuttle location being so close it was almost a guarantee that they would come to the coffee shop. I was right.

Yes there some filters involved but still doesn't take away the image. Yes. The table Is in all the photos. I wouldn't have it any other way.  
The camera never left the table.  Thus the reason I called this grounded.   The camera was still.

It ties in to false awakening. This is a real story. Frankly this is the type of story I usually chose not to share because it makes you come off delulu, making stuff up, causes you to lose credibility and so on. In any case, I don't care, so here it goes:

Me and my partner are in bed sleeping. We both hear someone knocking on the door, and it wakes us up. I'm half awake, but my wife just gets up and goes to answer the door. I look at my phone, and it's like 2 AM. I yell at her -""Why the Hell are you opening the door at 2 am?! Are you crazy?!"" (she some times sleep walks). I follow after my wife, and the girl is actually opening the front door. Before I can get there, I just see a guy standing on the street looking at us, he wasn't really at the door, more on the actual street past our garden. Really weird looking guy.

My wife is not responding to me, she's just standing at the door looking at him. All of a sudden, the weird guy ""rushes"" in to our house, goes right through my wife. Immediately when this happens, we both wake up and our 3 dogs are losing their mind. We have 3 shiba inus, which if you don't know, they don't bark, they scream really loud. So we both just jolt awake, and I thought someone broke in to the house, so I grab a gun and go in to the living room. I still had that weird dream in my head, but at this point I thought I just had a really disturbing nightmare. The dogs are all barking at our trash can, of all things.

We have one of those electronic trash cans. The type where it's really heavy, made out of metal, and you can't just ""open it"". To open the trash can, it requires you to place your hand over a sensor, located on the top of the can, this is to avoid having to touch the can. After a while that you do that, and it opens, a few seconds later it closes on it's own. So I come in to the kitchen, I look at the trash can, and it's open. The dogs are barking at it, losing their mind. The can then closes on it's own, as it's designed to do. I search the house, I look for an intruder, but I can't find anyone. So I assume maybe a rat got in the house.

I look through the can, trying to see if I can find a rat, nothing. I check the house, try to be quiet and listen to see if I can hear a rat going through our house, nothing. So I say screw it, and go back to bed. I lay down in bed and my wife apologizes. I say, hu? She says, -"" I thought it was UPS and it was my amazon package"". I ask her what the hell she's talking about again, and she is clearly half awake-half a sleep. That freaked me out, but I figured - Maybe she just heard me getting up or something, and dreamed that she told me to go check, I don't know. I'm tired, half awake, my heart is racing because I thought I was about to have to kill someone, so I just want to go back to sleep.

Next morning, I wake up and my wife is not sleeping next to me, which is odd, I always wake up first. I go to the kitchen and she's there drinking her coffee, doesn't look well. I ask her if she's ok, she tells me she had a really bad nightmare. I told her I also did, and I thought someone broke in to the house, but the dogs were just being annoying. She looks at me with a weird face and tells me, what do you mean? I told her that the dogs started barking like crazy last night, don't you remember? I even got up and went to check. She then tells me she had a really bad nightmare, where she woke up to answer the door and a really weird guy was standing out in the street, then all of a sudden, he rushed in to the house. So you can imagine how I felt hearing that, my heart sank to stomach. I told her I had the same dream, and we both decide we are going to sage our house that day.

I am then cutting the back yard grass that same morning, and I notice our shed is open. Here's what you gotta understand about our shed - It's bolt locked. Neither me or my wife ever use the shed, we just mostly store firewood in there, some camping stuff, and it's fairly small. It's not like a huge barn or something. The shed does have a strong, heavy, rusted lock, but it's not designed to keep people out. It's hard to describe the mechanism, but it's basically a bolt that locks it in place, but if anything with thumbs and a good amount of strength wants to open it, they can. It's not like it requires a key or something to unlock, just hands and strength. You gotta twist the metal open that locks it and pull the bolt, then open the 2 doors. Anyway, it's open. I have never found my shed open, ever, because the lock is so heavy. Yes, some times we have foxes and racoons, my logical answer is that it was an animal. My dog also keeps avoiding the shed, one of them usually likes to sleep next to it for shade, but he will not go near it. I'm assuming because he can smell an animal was there last night, and he's afraid or something, even though he's a hunting dog and the issue is usually the opposite. My dogs always kill the bunnies that come in to our yard, it's pretty depressing.

Anyway, I close it and assume it was a fox or something. The following evening, my wife is still at work and I'm on my computer working. All of a sudden someone is banging on my door, I go answer it and it's my neighbor. My neighbor tells me my dog got lose and is running around the neighborhood. This has NEVER happened before, in years of living here. The backyard has a door that locks in a similar way to the shed, you need thumbs to open it. It's also super high, the dong can't reach it. I think to my self, this damn fox is really being annoying... Maybe it unlocked the door yesterday and I just didn't notice, so when I let the dog in to the backyard, it just got out because the door was already open. I chase my dog for an hour, finally get him, and put him back inside the house. My neighbor gives me a spare lock he has, and I put it on the backyard door.

Following night, I get home from work. Before letting my dogs out, I go check to see if the door is still locked, because shiba inus, if don't know, once they escape, you will likely never see them again. I go to check and there it is again, the shed is wide open. You gotta understand that it's not just that you have to ""unlock"" the shed, the doors don't just open when you unlock it, you have to actually use force to then pull both doors open. Even if an animal did that, which I'm sure that's what it was, it wouldn't really open the doors like that. It would likely just have opened one, or made a small entrance and got out, the door would be half open, not wide open like a storm did it. So at this point I'm bothered, but It's just an animal, so I'm not losing my mind. I figure over the weekend I'll go to the hardware store and buy a lock or something, what ever. Couple nights go by, and one day I'm sleeping. I then hear from outside the shed door slam. My room has a window that looks out at the backyard, so we can hear pretty easy, but the shed is on the other side behind the house, in other words, out of view. The way it slammed open, I was sure it was a person. I assumed it was a homeless person sleeping in my shed, since it gets pretty cold during winter.

Again, I go out there with a gun, hoping I don't get shanked. I look in to the shed with a flashlight, nothing. Even the logs look unturned. The back yard door is also closed and still locked. Here's the other weird thing, if it was a person, that shed has camping supplies, and a really nice weather proof pop up tent. If I was homeless, that's the first thing I would steal, but nothing was ever stolen. Also, you can't slam these doors open like that, it has to be a huge animal or human, not a fox or a racoon, and we just don't have that here. I don't live in the country side, it's just a suburb. This happens enough times that me and my wife are thinking about buying a camera.

Finally, I buy a lock for the shed, one that requires a key. That same night, we both hear what sounds like something trying to open it, like yanking it open. I go outside, again expecting to see an animal, nothing. I get so paranoid I file a police report, and a cop actually comes over. I tell him what's been going on, and I'm concerned maybe it's a person breaking in to my yard, and ask if anyone else reported this. He said no, the neighborhood is really safe and nothing happens there usually, certainly nothing like this. He also tells me it's just an animal.

So me and my wife are deciding what camera to get, and we are debating on getting like a smart house type security system, where everything is watched from our phone. How ever, since the night we put the lock there, it just stopped happening. That was the end of it. We have had weird things happen in our house everywhere we lived, but I felt this one was interesting because we shared in a dream, where we both had a false awakening event, and then something physical coincidentally happened and kept happening.

Did we just share a weird dream? probably. Did the trash can malfunction or was it maybe a rat? sure, maybe. Was it an animal opening the shed? probably. I just thought I'd share. Sorry if it was to off topic for this sub, again, the only reason I posted here is because I thought the shared false awakening event was interesting, I didn't know that could happen. My wife has had very weird dreams since the day we moved in to this house a few years a go, dreams that are really disturbing and I don't even want to share because it's so over the top. Why not move out? Cause we like our house lol.

No the story does not have a more incredible ending where a priest came over and had to perform an exorcism on the shed or something, lol. It ended just like that.",2,1752442185.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False

I look through the can, trying to see if I can find a rat, nothing. I check the house, try to be quiet and listen to see if I can hear a rat going through our house, nothing. So I say screw it, and go back to bed. I lay down in bed and my wife apologizes. I say, hu? She says, -"" I thought it was UPS and it was my amazon package"". I ask her what the hell she's talking about again, and she is clearly half awake-half a sleep. That freaked me out, but I figured - Maybe she just heard me getting up or something, and dreamed that she told me to go check, I don't know. I'm tired, half awake, my heart is racing because I thought I was about to have to kill someone, so I just want to go back to sleep.

Next morning, I wake up and my wife is not sleeping next to me, which is odd, I always wake up first. I go to the kitchen and she's there drinking her coffee, doesn't look well. I ask her if she's ok, she tells me she had a really bad nightmare. I told her I also did, and I thought someone broke in to the house, but the dogs were just being annoying. She looks at me with a weird face and tells me, what do you mean? I told her that the dogs started barking like crazy last night, don't you remember? I even got up and went to check. She then tells me she had a really bad nightmare, where she woke up to answer the door and a really weird guy was standing out in the street, then all of a sudden, he rushed in to the house. So you can imagine how I felt hearing that, my heart sank to stomach. I told her I had the same dream, and we both decide we are going to sage our house that day.

I am then cutting the back yard grass that same morning, and I notice our shed is open. Here's what you gotta understand about our shed - It's bolt locked. Neither me or my wife ever use the shed, we just mostly store firewood in there, some camping stuff, and it's fairly small. It's not like a huge barn or something. The shed does have a strong, heavy, rusted lock, but it's not designed to keep people out. It's hard to describe the mechanism, but it's basically a bolt that locks it in place, but if anything with thumbs and a good amount of strength wants to open it, they can. It's not like it requires a key or something to unlock, just hands and strength. You gotta twist the metal open that locks it and pull the bolt, then open the 2 doors. Anyway, it's open. I have never found my shed open, ever, because the lock is so heavy. Yes, some times we have foxes and racoons, my logical answer is that it was an animal. My dog also keeps avoiding the shed, one of them usually likes to sleep next to it for shade, but he will not go near it. I'm assuming because he can smell an animal was there last night, and he's afraid or something, even though he's a hunting dog and the issue is usually the opposite. My dogs always kill the bunnies that come in to our yard, it's pretty depressing.

Anyway, I close it and assume it was a fox or something. The following evening, my wife is still at work and I'm on my computer working. All of a sudden someone is banging on my door, I go answer it and it's my neighbor. My neighbor tells me my dog got lose and is running around the neighborhood. This has NEVER happened before, in years of living here. The backyard has a door that locks in a similar way to the shed, you need thumbs to open it. It's also super high, the dong can't reach it. I think to my self, this damn fox is really being annoying... Maybe it unlocked the door yesterday and I just didn't notice, so when I let the dog in to the backyard, it just got out because the door was already open. I chase my dog for an hour, finally get him, and put him back inside the house. My neighbor gives me a spare lock he has, and I put it on the backyard door.

Following night, I get home from work. Before letting my dogs out, I go check to see if the door is still locked, because shiba inus, if don't know, once they escape, you will likely never see them again. I go to check and there it is again, the shed is wide open. You gotta understand that it's not just that you have to ""unlock"" the shed, the doors don't just open when you unlock it, you have to actually use force to then pull both doors open. Even if an animal did that, which I'm sure that's what it was, it wouldn't really open the doors like that. It would likely just have opened one, or made a small entrance and got out, the door would be half open, not wide open like a storm did it. So at this point I'm bothered, but It's just an animal, so I'm not losing my mind. I figure over the weekend I'll go to the hardware store and buy a lock or something, what ever. Couple nights go by, and one day I'm sleeping. I then hear from outside the shed door slam. My room has a window that looks out at the backyard, so we can hear pretty easy, but the shed is on the other side behind the house, in other words, out of view. The way it slammed open, I was sure it was a person. I assumed it was a homeless person sleeping in my shed, since it gets pretty cold during winter.

Again, I go out there with a gun, hoping I don't get shanked. I look in to the shed with a flashlight, nothing. Even the logs look unturned. The back yard door is also closed and still locked. Here's the other weird thing, if it was a person, that shed has camping supplies, and a really nice weather proof pop up tent. If I was homeless, that's the first thing I would steal, but nothing was ever stolen. Also, you can't slam these doors open like that, it has to be a huge animal or human, not a fox or a racoon, and we just don't have that here. I don't live in the country side, it's just a suburb. This happens enough times that me and my wife are thinking about buying a camera.

Finally, I buy a lock for the shed, one that requires a key. That same night, we both hear what sounds like something trying to open it, like yanking it open. I go outside, again expecting to see an animal, nothing. I get so paranoid I file a police report, and a cop actually comes over. I tell him what's been going on, and I'm concerned maybe it's a person breaking in to my yard, and ask if anyone else reported this. He said no, the neighborhood is really safe and nothing happens there usually, certainly nothing like this. He also tells me it's just an animal.

So me and my wife are deciding what camera to get, and we are debating on getting like a smart house type security system, where everything is watched from our phone. How ever, since the night we put the lock there, it just stopped happening. That was the end of it. We have had weird things happen in our house everywhere we lived, but I felt this one was interesting because we shared in a dream, where we both had a false awakening event, and then something physical coincidentally happened and kept happening.

Did we just share a weird dream? probably. Did the trash can malfunction or was it maybe a rat? sure, maybe. Was it an animal opening the shed? probably. I just thought I'd share. Sorry if it was to off topic for this sub, again, the only reason I posted here is because I thought the shared false awakening event was interesting, I didn't know that could happen. My wife has had very weird dreams since the day we moved in to this house a few years a go, dreams that are really disturbing and I don't even want to share because it's so over the top. Why not move out? Cause we like our house lol.

No the story does not have a more incredible ending where a priest came over and had to perform an exorcism on the shed or something, lol. It ended just like that.",2,1752442178.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

Lads. LADSSSS.

I don‚Äôt want to alarm anyone, but I think we may have accidentally turned into the Canary Islands. For two whole days now, the sun has been visible. In the actual sky. Not a hallucination, not a filtered Instagram post from someone in Spain ‚Äî the real sun. It‚Äôs like Ireland went on a retreat, found itself, and came back wearing sunglasses and smugness.

The transformation has been biblical. Yesterday I saw three men shirtless in a Lidl car park, all of them the exact shade of microwave pizza. Not a cloud in sight, just 19 degrees of pure, unfiltered national euphoria. I went out to put the bins out and accidentally stayed in the garden for seven hours. No sunscreen. No water. Just vibes.

Every problem in Ireland vanishes when the sun appears. The mortgage crisis? Irrelevant. We‚Äôll just live in tents in the back garden now. The healthcare system? Bit of sun and Sudocrem will sort that. Political corruption? If Leo promises us three more sunny days, he can have my vote and my last Club Orange.

And somehow we all become weather experts overnight. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just warm, it‚Äôs a dry heat.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming up from the Azores, you know.‚Äù Karen from Accounts, who hasn‚Äôt said a word to me in years, gave me a full forecast using only her knees and a jug of diluted MiWadi.

People are barbecuing things that should never touch charcoal. I saw someone grilling a lasagne outside a Centra. A full, bubbling lasagne, on a disposable barbecue. And I let it happen. That‚Äôs the sort of ambition solar power gives us.

And the outfits. Merciful hour. Men are wearing shorts so tight they look vacuum-sealed. Women are pulling out sundresses that haven‚Äôt seen daylight since Electric Picnic 2016. Teenagers are dissolving into the pavement, clutching iced coffees like holy relics.

Dogs have lost the run of themselves. Fields full of topless lads booting footballs like they‚Äôre trying to impress the Virgin Mary. My neighbour burned his shins so badly he now walks like a malfunctioning robot but insists he‚Äôs ‚Äúgrand, sure.‚Äù

And without fail, someone says ‚ÄúIreland‚Äôs actually lovely when the weather‚Äôs good,‚Äù as if we haven‚Äôt spent the last 300 days existing inside a damp hoodie.

But we know it won‚Äôt last. This is the Irish summer. A 48-hour heat-induced hallucination, followed by six months of drizzle and despair. We are Cinderella at the ball, except instead of a glass slipper, we leave behind a half-melted Twister and a peeling sunburn.

So get out there. Sit on a wall. Drink a warm can. Burn your shoulders. Because when the sun shines in Ireland, we become the happiest, thirstiest, most unhinged little nation on Earth.

TL;DR: The sun came out, and now we‚Äôre all feral Mediterranean goblins. 10/10, would sunstroke again. ‚òÄÔ∏èüáÆüá™",38,1752442085.0,CasualIreland,8,0.84,False

Fights that you thought were total bs the first few times you fought them but as you ground your way through the optional quest list or whatever you finally had that lightbulb moment where it all made sense and that fight suddenly became really fun.
Zinogre is not that for me, this thing is just agonisingly unfun no matter how I fight the bitch.

The piece of shit‚Äôs combos never fucking end! They just don‚Äôt stop! And that in itself wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, he‚Äôs not the first hyperactive dog in World after all. Unlike Odo though, he‚Äôs fucking enormous and he loves ending off his combos with some massive AoE with an inflated hitbox. I can get morph sweep combos off against Odo on the regular because he‚Äôs small enough and his hitboxes are clean enough that you can wind up a big combo while he‚Äôs still attacking with one dodge. Zinny forces you to stay miles away from him until he‚Äôs done his full fucking combo chain unless you‚Äôre willing to take a trade with his weeaboo breakdance or puppy back slam, both of which has big downtime to punish but will knock you down if you get hit and he‚Äôll be up again by the time you‚Äôre on your feet and healed so you have to wait all over again!

This shit took me 25 minutes with Switch Axe taking trades and the same amount of time with Hunting Horn playing it safe.
So what about using the leftover pieces from his dead body to craft that railgun HBG of his and stick a shield on it? A wonderful idea! That way I can completely disengage with the fight and kill him in under 10 minutes! But uh-oh! Looks like that random lightning bug circle went behind your shield and flinched you into a follow up! Looks like he zoned you up against a wall or a ledge so now you can‚Äôt back away from his cocksucking pin attack that ignores shield and has a longer recovery time for you than the windup for some of his follow-ups! Or you‚Äôre out of bullets but he won‚Äôt fucking stop constantly mashing 5 piece combos in your face so you have to wait for minutes at a time before you can reload or just wait for the constant chip damage to finally kill you! Or you got a GOLD CROWN in the fucking arena again and he‚Äôs so fucking massive that you can‚Äôt see anything when he‚Äôs teabagging you like a toxic COD player! He‚Äôs already big enough to call Anjanath tiny and the visual clarity when he‚Äôs slamming all over you is already so bad, I don‚Äôt need it made worse but here we fucking are!

And he‚Äôs so fucking weeby too, he has an ok design but always had this anime over the top flare that didn‚Äôt click with me, which was made even worse by the moveset. Seeing that breakdancing spin he does made me cringe so fucking hard the first time I saw it, and now that I‚Äôve seen it for the 200th time it‚Äôs honestly not any better.

I know he‚Äôs the most popular monster after all, but maybe there‚Äôs other people who feels the same somewhere. Or better yet, maybe there‚Äôs other people who actually like the fight and they know some kind of a way to make it fun. Let me just look online real quick and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all just dog shit. ‚ÄúHis pin attack looks like he‚Äôs licking me, I want to pet him so bad!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a cute doggo!‚Äù ‚ÄúHis slam where he leaves his tummy in the air is so cute, he just wants to play!‚Äù ‚ÄúZinogre is a ronin, roaming masterless from land to land‚Ä¶‚Äù
Blud what the absolute fuck is this? How much of this is irony and how much of this is people genuinely writing this in their fursuits while drinking from their ‚Äòdogs are better than people‚Äô coffee mugs? I just want to know how to make this fight fast and fun. Here for a good time not a long time type deal, please just someone tell me how you find this fight fun!
It feels like this whole fight is designed less about engaging with the player and more like playing action figures with your 7 year old adhd cousin who just ate 20 sugar cubes and discovered Naruto last week.
‚ÄòNo it‚Äôs not your turn yet! Just watch, this is really cool, WHOOSH WHOOSHWHOOSHOOSHOOSH! And he does a super cool spin and then BOOM! He does a slam and lightning EXPLODES all over the place, and.. NO! IT‚ÄôS NOT YOUR TURN YET! And then he HOWLS! And BOOSH! SKIDOOSH! SKIDOOSH! He SLAMS all over the place! And then‚Ä¶‚Äô

Bro, I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt want to stand 20 feet away from a monster and watch it do weeb combo after weeb combo after weeb combo before I can finally go in and take my hits, or just beat his face in for minutes at a time while he stands there doing nothing before deciding to explode into lightning again.

Well, thank fucking god I only need to do it a few times and there‚Äôs no incredibly bad rng deco farm attached to it.
Thanks fucking Jesus tap dancing Christ on a bike with boxing gloves that I don‚Äôt need to fight it in the Ancient Forest, the most horrible cramped location with the most annoyingly varied terrain, the absolute WORST PLACE IMAGINABLE TO FIGHT A MASSIVE HIGHLY MOBILE CONSTANT HITBOX!

The ability to accommodate everything from small coffee cups to oversized water bottles is essential for versatility.**Durable Construction Materials:**

The materials used in constructing the cup holder expander play a significant role in it's overall durability and longevity. Many high-quality models are made from ABS plastic, which is known for its impact resistance and heat resistance.

The ability to rotate 360 degrees allows users to position their drinks in the most convenient and accessible location. This is particularly useful in vehicles with awkwardly placed cup holders or when multiple passengers need to access the same drink.

1lz4bco,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1lz4bco/dating_an_avoidant/,Dating an avoidant,"Turned out to be a long message. Please, read it. This avoidant situation is new to me, and I would love feedback.

I've been dating a girl for about 6 weeks. I've never met someone as enthousiastic about me as she was. She's very vocal about being attracted to me and our personalities match perfectly. She called herself very lucky to date me. Told me she was looking forward to seeing me every time, and said she was having a great time and wanted to know how this would develop in the future. 

I had an tattoo appointment in a city that's a 2 hour drive. I asked her to come along, so we could spend the rest of that day together (coffee, shopping, dinner, whatever). We would return home the same day. She liked that, and said we should go a day before and sleep at a hotel. A couple days later I asked if she was sure about that. She was, so I booked the hotel.

6 days before the trip, we had our first sleepover and we had sex for the first time. It was very intimate and loving. We hugged before and afterwards for a long time.

3 days before the trip, she called to cancel the weekend. She had some personal things to work out, but didnt want to say what. She said that if, with those emotions/thoughts, we went on that trip, she would completely shut down. I told her thats okay and told her she could talk to me about the problems. She wasnt comfortable sharing that. I stopped asking her about it to respect her boundaries. I asked if I did something wrong. She said I didnt. I asked if the sex/sleepover had anything to do with it. She said she was looking forward to that/was curious about our sex for a while, and that she was comfortable during and after. I asked her twice if she wanted to stop seeing me, or if she wants to continue dating. She wanted to continue dating, but needed that weekend to think some things over. 

She stopped texting me since then. I texted her 2 days later saying that I'm not looking for a conversation and that she doesnt need to answer. I just reassured her in that message that I'm not in a hurry and that i dont have any expectations for her, that we can take it as slowly as she likes and that I will give her the space she needs. No answer.

Its been 3 days since then. Nothing. Before that, we texted throughout the entire day, every day. She was always online on whatsapp talking to me or friends. I've not seen her online for days.
Just now send her a text: 'Hi, how was your weekend? I got this tattoo and I love it.' No demands or intrusive questions about her situation. Just a very short message so she knows I'm still there. I got no reply.

What do I do? I really like her. The way she compliments me, talks to me, looks at me, laughs at my stupid jokes and tells me she wishes I was there to hug, tells me enough. I think she likes me too.

Does the thought of scaring me after 6 weeks scare her? Did she shutdown or want space because of that? Surely, if she wanted to stop dating, she would have told me. I asked her twice when she called to cancel our trip, so I gave her the oppertunity to let me know she's not interested in me...",2,1752441824.0,emotionalintelligence,14,0.63,False

I posted an ad on reddit recently seeking an affair and received a ton of messages. I‚Äôve done this many times over the years with varying success so I‚Äôm no newbie.

One guy stood out and we instantly hit it off. Both aligned on what we‚Äôre seeking, exchanged photos and established mutual attraction, traded lots of flirty texts for about a week. Our schedules finally synced and we decided to meet for coffee. 

The date was great, albeit I was incredibly nervous and yammering on about god knows what. That didn‚Äôt seem to faze him because about 30 minutes in, after we both finished our drinks, he said, ‚ÄúDo you want to go make out in my car?‚Äù 

The physical chemistry was electric (at least from my side). We got handsy. One of the best makeout sessions I‚Äôve ever had. We both had to get to work but we picked our texting back up immediately. We sent some spicy photos. He told me he was looking forward to more meetups in the future. I suggested we try to find a time in the next week for a hotel meet. 

He mentioned he had some stuff that would probably keep him busy that week but that maybe later in the week could work. He kept me up to date on his week but then the communication started to drop. Five days passed with no message. I figured I was getting ghosted.

Then on the sixth day with no contact, he reached out and apologized for ghosting. Said there had been some health issues in his wife‚Äôs family and he was trying to be present at home for her. He then said he needed to pause things with us and was hoping I‚Äôd be open to reconnecting when things calm down for him and he‚Äôs in a more available space. I told him of course and to take care of himself and his family. 

That was two weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about him. I‚Äôve chatted with some others and even met another guy for coffee who seems promising, but I can‚Äôt get this man out of my head. It‚Äôs almost obsessive. I know he‚Äôs on a family vacation this week but I‚Äôm really hoping when he returns, he reaches out.

But am I deluded? Did I just get let down gently? Did he meet someone else he likes more? What is the likelihood that he really is just overwhelmed with life and will reach out soon?",0,1752441222.0,adultery,5,0.5,False

I want to share some practical tips that have worked really well for me.

First, let's talk about lighting. I've found that string lights are absolutely game-changing for gazebos. They create this amazing ambiance that transforms the space completely after sunset. I usually go for warm white LED lights because they're energy-efficient and create a cozy atmosphere. Hanging them in a zigzag pattern across the top gives the best coverage.

Plants are another essential element. I love using hanging baskets with trailing plants like petunias or ivy. They add life and color without taking up floor space. For larger gazebos, I've had success placing potted plants in the corners - they really help soften the structure's lines.

Furniture is crucial for comfort. Recently, I found some amazing weather-resistant furniture sets at https://athometouch.com/gazebos that perfectly fit my space. The key is not to overcrowd - you want enough room to move around comfortably.

For privacy and shade, outdoor curtains work wonders. I use weather-resistant ones that can handle rain and sun. They're great for blocking harsh afternoon sun or creating a more intimate setting for gatherings.

Speaking of comfort, adding outdoor cushions and throws makes the space much more inviting. I keep a storage bench inside the gazebo to store these when not in use. This prevents weather damage and keeps everything clean.

One often-overlooked aspect is flooring. I added an outdoor rug that really tied everything together. It helps define the space and makes it feel more like an outdoor room. Just make sure to get one specifically designed for outdoor use.

For year-round enjoyment, I installed a ceiling fan in my gazebo. It keeps air circulating during hot summer days and helps with mosquitos too. You can find some great options at https://athometouch.com/gazebos along with other gazebo accessories.

Sound is another element that can enhance the space. I use small, weather-resistant bluetooth speakers hidden in planters to create atmosphere without visible electronics.

Remember to consider seasonal decorations too. I switch things up with different pillows and decor pieces according to the season. During holidays, I add themed elements that make the gazebo feel festive and current.

The key to successful gazebo decoration is creating layers of interest while maintaining functionality. Start with the basics - seating and lighting - then build from there. Don't feel pressured to do everything at once; let your space evolve as you use it and understand what works best for your needs.

My final piece of advice is to make it personal. Add elements that reflect your style and how you plan to use the space. Whether it's for quiet morning coffee or entertaining friends, your gazebo should feel like a natural extension of your home.",1,1752441211.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False
1lz41vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaysian/comments/1lz41vh/the_legendary_babylon_sauna_in_bangkok_closed/,"The legendary ""Babylon"" Sauna in Bangkok closed four years ago: What's your most beautiful experience?","In 2007, the Babylon Sauna was Bangkok‚Äôs premier gay sauna and a global standout, often hailed as the ‚Äúmost beautiful sauna in the world.‚Äù Located on South Sathorn Road Soi 1, near the vibrant Silom gay district and just behind the German Embassy, it was a sprawling, tropical oasis in the heart of the city. Although I had spent two weeks in BKK, I only managed to visit the Babylon right before heading to the airport for my flight back home. My first and only visit at this paradise.

The complex blended Thai Deco aesthetics with lush gardens, a large outdoor swimming pool, and modern facilities like steam rooms, dry saunas, jacuzzies, a gym, and a maze of private cabins. Guests, who were mostly international visitors (99% of them flight crew members of all airlines!) in their 30s alongside some local Thai men, received a towel as the dress code (except during special events) and could use secure lockers for valuables. The atmosphere was relaxed yet lively, especially on weekend afternoons after 4 p.m., when the sauna buzzed with activity, drawing a diverse crowd seeking both relaxation and connection.

The sauna was part of a unique gay complex that included a hotel, the Babylon Bangkok, offering barrack-style rooms and upscale suites with Burmese furnishings and marble bathrooms. Guests staying at the hotel enjoyed free sauna access, making it a seamless experience for travelers. The on-site restaurant was a highlight, serving surprisingly high-quality meals in a stylish setting with views of the pool and gardens. A coffee shop, courtyard bar, and pool bar added to the resort-like vibe, while professional massage services, a barbershop, and a fitness center catered to those seeking a full pampering experience. The design, inspired by the vision of its founder Khun Toc, emphasized a blend of masculinity and elegance, creating a space that felt like both a sanctuary and a social hub. The crowd at Babylon in 2007 was diverse, with a mix of international ‚Äúfarangs‚Äù (foreigners) and local Thais, though reviews noted fewer locals compared to other venues.

I enjoyed a haircut, had a snack at the restaurant, checked my Gayromeo messages in the business center since back in 2007, I had no smartphone. Then I got a great two hour massage by a 21yo, very gifted young man. His name was Somchai, he had some acne issues in his face but I found him very cute, all in all. Also, I never reduce someone to just a bunch of pimples. I made him a compliment, and he told me that he had never gotten a compliment ever from any customer. His massage was a real, almost medical, very relaxing massage but with the obligatory happy end, of course. I paid 600 Thai Baht for it, roughly 20 US dollars or euros, same thing. I gave Somchai a 500 Baht tip, and he was shocked and wanted to BJ me in return, but I just wished him well, told him again that he was a cutie and that acne is a sign of youth, and thanked him for his excellent service. After the massage, I joined a foam party in the pool with 200 naked men or so. I recall a Japanese boy in his mid-20s being very naughty, hugging me from behind and kissing me all over without even asking for permission to do so. I eventually turned around and just rubbed my body against his front as a dominant way to tell him who I am but this weirdo obviously enjoyed it and came. A very strange foam party in retrospective.

Prices were reasonable for the time, with entry around 260 Baht (roughly 8 dollars/euros), cheaper than competitors like R3 or Mania, and drinks like a vodka tonic at 120 Baht were seen as a bargain. Overall, Babylon in 2007 was a unique blend of luxury, community, and adventure, leaving a lasting impression as a gay paradise that combined Thai hospitality with a global, inclusive vibe‚Äîa place where visitors could relax, connect, and create lasting memories. I took a taxi directly from the Babylon to the airport and flew home.

If you see it on my profile I just really want some support on my decision. Alexa is one of my few remaining friends in life and has been my friend for about four years.

Small trigger warning topics of abusive relationships and physical abuse from an ex

Okay so I 18 F (genderfluid) went on my senior trip with my school on May 13 and came back on May 15. I‚Äôm being loose with the information because I graduated May 29th 2025 and honestly don‚Äôt care anymore. On day one we got there at the bus stop at 3am all was good me and my friends were excited and happy. We get on the bus and I wanted to sit with my friend will call her Tammy. Before I could sit with Tammy Alexa sat down next to her. Me and Tammy said it‚Äôs whatever because Alexa is our best friend. Day one is fine other than the short waits at universal studios and Alexa refusing to redo a few fun rides and threatening to move on to the next ride without me or Tammy. 

Now here‚Äôs where things started to really go south. By morning I got up super early I‚Äôm talking 5:30am early. Tammy was cool with it because she wanted to find the perfect outfit for Disney in the morning. While I on the other hand needed to shower before I was on my cycle again. Things were perfect Alexa decided that she wanted to sleep in as she should since out of the three of us she stayed up super late. Probably about 1:00am or 2:00am me and Tammy on the other hand slept fell asleep probably around 12:00am. Regardless we waited to wake her up around 6:40am which would give her 20 minutes to get ready before breakfast time. By the time it was breakfast we showed up late because it took forever to wake up Alexa. By the time we got downstairs we were ready for some food. Alexa had snapped at me and Tammy for multiple reasons. For starters we got up to early even though we discussed that we would be waking up this early multiple times throughout the day before we got to the hotel. Then we didn‚Äôt wake her up early enough even though she said not to wake her up. Then there was us being ready before her and ready to get food without her. Check out was at 7:40am and we all had to be downstairs and ready to go at 7:50 so we could leave at 8:00am. Finally the last reason she snapped at us was because we left our luggage in the room and convinced her to do the same since me and Tammy both thought we would come back to the room after Disney land which we were wrong. Alexa yelled at us over the situation making me and Tammy feel really bad about the situation. Which we know it was a mistake which led us to being even more late to breakfast we had to get staff to get us a card to let us into the room. Alexa with a attitude grabbed her stuff and left while me and Alexa had to scramble together to grab the food that was in fact mostly Alexa‚Äôs and pack pack up what remained of our supplies from the day prior. We made it out around probably 7:45am and got lucky because the teachers went to the bathroom and we‚Äôre taking a super long time the didn‚Äôt leave till around 8:00am to 8:10am.  Me and Tammy got food which Tammy was super happy while I was still stressed out from the morning and struggled to eat a pancake. Alexa‚Äôs excuse for her attitude was that she was hungry and needed her coffee as well. So we brushed it off because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day over such a petty thing. We walked a few blocks to the park which let me calm down. We got food at the Starbucks which was pretty good Tammy tried my food which was the impossible breakfast sandwich and a custom drink from Lemon8 and Tammy was impressed. While Alexa judged my food choice and insulted my impossible breakfast sandwich (I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian but for context back in 2015 to 2016 then 2018 to 2019 my parents became vegetarians so I‚Äôm open to a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and love the breakfast sandwich from Starbucks). 

Now fast forward after several long waits throughout the park Alexa is asks ‚Äúdo we want to have dinner with my boyfriend and his friends?‚Äù Me and Tammy said ‚Äúno‚Äù. For context we aren‚Äôt a fan of one of Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs friends for some stuff he did to my other friend which I won‚Äôt be getting to into at the moment. The rest of his friends we don‚Äôt know or like he‚Äôs friends with a few dirt bags and some don‚Äôt know how to act in public. Think the stereotype of a group of guys in 7th grade but just stuck in the body of 17, 18, and 19 year olds. Gross people who make inappropriate jokes that make others feel uncomfortable while being obnoxious and very loud. Some of them have been kicked out of places because they made people feel uncomfortable or upset. Another way to think of them would be the people who participate in Minecraft movies type of guys. Throwing buckets and bags of popcorn yelling causing a scene dancing but hitting people around them and making messes they won‚Äôt clean up. Overall we weren‚Äôt going anywhere near that chaos. So I explained after everything the guy did that hurt my friend I just don‚Äôt want to be around him because I know I won‚Äôt be able to hold my tongue if he says anything to me. (Off topic he started dating a girl who threatened harm towards me when me and my ex got into a fight. It was so bad I had to get a form of restraining order against her which he knows I was and still am very mad at him. I can‚Äôt be around him.) Alexa didn‚Äôt like my response and made the statement of ‚Äúcommon op please I just want to spend time with my boyfriend if I can make sacrifices for you and your ex when you were 15 then you can make sacrifices for me and my boyfriend and his friends‚Äù. For context the ex she‚Äôs referencing if my abusive ex that I got with when I was 15 and he was almost 18 I don‚Äôt want to get into the details of what happened in this post but when he turned 18 and I was still 15 he became abusive and then wanted me to become a teen mom to his children (I posted on this in the past it was a traumatic experience and I overall don‚Äôt talk about it often now without having a panic attack). Thanks to this I stopped talking for a good 15, 20 minutes just from shock since the topic of my ex was out of nowhere I almost cried I had to pull myself together since I was in public. Honestly I say I did a pretty good job covering how I felt but Tammy checked in on me a lot I went from super chatty and happy to super quiet and distant. Which shoutout to Tammy for being awesome and taking a calmer approach to the situation of comforting me without being over the top. Alexa didn‚Äôt apologize we got on the ride after a few minutes then Alexa ignored the tension and started talking about how we should get on the boat ride to rest and see where it goes which was just in a giant circle. I told Tammy that I need some space because I felt very overwhelmed she understood that and distracted Alexa while I called my girlfriend and told her what happened without crying. She comforted me as best as she could even though she all the way in New Mexico while I‚Äôm in Disney land we hung up and I realize I was being selfish by feeling how I felt. So I sucked it up and tried my best to go back to how I felt. We went to a gift shop so I can buy a plushie but I started to actually feel unwell. It was in the 70 something degrees I felt nauseous and lightheaded (I‚Äôm low on iron and bleeding a lot walking in the heat with a sweater on) and had to sit down. Everyone was getting so I took us to downtown Disney for lunch. 

By the time I got us to Splitsville Alexa was mad because it would cost us a lot of money that we didn‚Äôt have. When I told them they don‚Äôt charge too much and a good amount for the three of us. When Alexa got mad at me and I suggested we go to California adventure and look for something there she refused. In Alexa‚Äôs own words she said ‚Äúthey charge us for being inside the restaurant and we have to order other wise we will get charged for stopping by at any other shop or restaurant.‚Äù I was very confused.  She wouldn‚Äôt elaborate no matter how much I asked. So we sat down and she gave both me and Tammy the silent treatment. Tammy on the other hand was nervous she thought we would pay around 100$ or 200$ on the food and entry fee. I love Tammy being that she‚Äôs my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt go to many restaurants compared to me or Alexa. She didn‚Äôt know if I was right or she was right but she was stressed out because she didn‚Äôt have more than 12$. I told her multiple times I‚Äôll pay for her portions but she was very nervous. Tammy was so scared she ordered a water so the bill won‚Äôt go up be to much. Me Tammy and Alexa got a cheese pizza and chicken fingers with I think a Dr Pepper and root beer with a water. Our total bill about 53$. Alexa kept looking for an entry fee saying it‚Äôs only this high because our entry fee. When I broke down the cost she was shocked. We left with our pockets still full and our stomach fuller. 

We had hopper passes so we moved to California adventure. We got there and Tammy wanted to do the guardians of the galaxy ride. Alexa was terrified and in the process got in line and out of line multiple times eventually she chose to not get in line. We waited in line for two hours. Within the two hours me and Tammy talked about the situations throughout the day Tammy was mad at Alexa for how she acted in the morning then what she said. By the time Tammy came back in line I needed to make a quick call to Amazon over an issue with a package that didn‚Äôt come on time. Yes I called Amazon at Disney in a super long line it was just to get a boring task out the way in a super long boring line. Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them. For lack of better words me and Tammy said ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù (side note look up a video of California adventures giant Ferris wheel it is actually terrifying especially how some of the carts slide and rock) we didn‚Äôt want to 3rd and 4th wheel their date. Something to take note of where not supposed to split from our group by doing so if we‚Äôre caught we will face serious consequences once where back at school. They also made the plans that if me and Tammy won‚Äôt go to dinner with Alexa and boyfriend she‚Äôll go regardless. They went to the Spider-Man ride I was annoyed so I went to tell my girlfriend again what happened. Which shoutout to my girlfriend for being so supportive and caring during that day listening to my rants on Alexa. It took them a while to get in and out which like I warned them multiple times the ride broke down on them Alexa ditched me and Tammy to hang out with her boyfriend after. Long story short me and Tammy had a great time five hours. We got boba from San Fran, Tokyo.and Tammy got to try clam chowder bowls for the first time which she‚Äôs in love with. (Off topic bread bowls besties forever need to be a shirt she loves them so much and so do I) now this is finally part that is the main reason for this post. 

As I said it‚Äôs been five hours since we heard from Alexa. It‚Äôs time to go and Tammy and I have to find her. Not just that we‚Äôre at the meeting place and couldn‚Äôt find anyone there. We called Alexa and she immediately hung up on us(side note there‚Äôs a app we were supposed to download to get updates on where we‚Äôre supposed to go Tammy is a android user and Alexa is iOS user). I didn‚Äôt have the app because we weren‚Äôt supposed to split up at all Tammy and Alexa had the app. I now know how stupid that was. Tammy‚Äôs phone was at 2% and we tried to find the meeting spot. Alexa texted the group chat and said ‚Äústop calling I‚Äôm at 25% and I need my phone we can talk on the bus‚Äù we texted saying it‚Äôs an emergency. We thought the bus got the students early because none of our classmates were around and we didn‚Äôt see our bus either. Turns out you need special permission to bring a bus to Disneyland so we had to walk to the bus about 3 miles out. The group thankfully didn‚Äôt leave yet everyone just shifted to Disneyland for the firework show. After spam calling Alexa here‚Äôs the main interaction once answer after 10 calls.

Heres a recap of the call:
Alexa: What do you want you‚Äôre killing my phone battery.
Tammy: Dude where are you me and op are lost and were freaking out did the school leave Disney.
Alexa: No where all here by the fountain.
Tammy: Cool which fountain and by what shop there‚Äôs a lot of fountains.
Alexa: The fountain on the way to the place we had lunch at.
Tammy: op said there‚Äôs a bunch of fountains Alexa where are you close by so we can head towards that location.
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Oh my f***ing gosh your friends are so (he calls us the R slur).
Alexa: you‚Äôll see it once you‚Äôre close by. 
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Tell them to use the f***ing app.
Tammy: My phone is at 2% nothing is loading I‚Äôm calling from OP‚Äôs phone.
Alexa: Just start walking when I see you I‚Äôll let you know.

I don‚Äôt recall the rest of the call other than Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend calling us the R slur and cursing at us. Alexa didn‚Äôt stop her boyfriend at all and eventually said to call her boyfriend for instructions to find the place. Me and Tammy walked almost to the monorails in downtown Disney and saw no one we had to walk back to the gates and still saw no one. It was 11pm I‚Äôm about to cry because me and Tammy are lost we don‚Äôt see anyone we recognize were getting called the R slur and cursed out by our friends boyfriend it‚Äôs late my feet hurt I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm feeling sharp pains in my legs (I have issues with my feet so if I‚Äôm on them for too long I feel sharp pain in my feet and legs I had been on them for two hours at that point with no breaks and a total of three four hours). Tammy saw my eyes start watering and started yelling and cursing at both Alexa and Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend. Their response, hang up on us. Tammy hugged me and comforted me because the whole day overall had been a drag. We got lucky and found a teacher from our school and followed him turns out they moved the first meeting spot to this random hidden corner. We later go to the main meeting spot around 11:30pm. By the time Alexa reached out to us which was 11:40 she sent the text of a shitty photo of where we later meet at to Tammy‚Äôs phone. After all this I‚Äôm thinking about going no contact with my bestie.

1lz40wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1lz40wg/suspected_water_damage_under_shower_pan/,Suspected water damage under shower pan,"tl;dr: Suspect hidden water damage from faulty drain in center of downstairs shower (and potentially faulty waterproofing of surround). Unrelated window and roof leaks may speak to other potential builder issues. I'm not sure what all I should be doing, what recourse I have, if I'm missing anything. 

\---

I'm writing this post to get general advice, as I am feeling lost and tossed around by the insurance and various contractors/technicians. 

I live in a two story condo in central Texas. I bought the place new in Aug 2015. A month or so ago I became aware that the master (downstairs) shower drain grid would not close properly and that the gasket (a cylindrical one) had almost shimmied up a bit, thus preventing the grid plate from sitting flush. I couldn't push it down myself; it was almost like caught on the central pipe as if there wasn't room for it around it. I didn't think much of it initially but it did not take me long to realize a lot of various ""symptoms"" I'd been noticing may have been related. 

I had been occasionally smelling cat smells (cat litter dust and cat vomit), despite my cat having passed away four years ago and not having another one in here since. With the layout of my house, the closet where her litter box had been is on the wall outside one wall of the shower, and the wall/corner where she had thrown up several times in her last days is on the outside of another wall of the shower. There had also been a general musty, rotten smell that I would occasionally smell in my bedroom (the bathroom is off my bedroom). 

Since I am very sensitive to smells, I didn't think much of it. I also keep my coffee machine on my nightstand so I can hit go on that when my alarm goes off and snooze to the aroma of fresh brewed coffee and awaken to a fresh cup - so I assumed maybe some musty odors were just coming from there. 

But it all just sort of came together for me that there is a very good chance that that shower pan drain apparatus had failed and was no longer water tight (and who knows when it officially started leaking!) and that the floor underneath the pan had been getting water-logged and that water (vapor at minimum) is seeping towards the surrounding walls and thus causing those odor particles to off-gas. 

So I stopped using that shower as soon as that occurred to me, and lo and behold the smells stopped pretty quickly. I tried to do some of my own diagnostics - got a little endoscope to look in between the walls, but that didn't end up helping much because in the litter box closet wall, while I got the scope in there, I wasn't really sure what I was looking at. It didn't seem overtly water logged or covered in mold, but idk. And then I couldn't get a hole in from the living room b/c I kept hitting what seemed like wood studs (though I have a stud finder, and I was def in between vertical studs). There is no visible water damage anywhere around any of this. Just the smells that magically disappeared upon stopping using that shower. 

I pre-emptively asked my insurance agent what filing a claim would entail. He answered those questions but didn't really give me any guidance. 

I called a plumber in who looked at the drain. He wrote: ""...shower pan that is no longer waterproof with a offset drain at slab level. The shower pan gasket and grid strainer are also compromised and failing."" My impression from what he said to me in person was that the construction was wonky and may have contributed to it eventually failing. He basically said that I would need to tear the whole thing out to fix it, and that to take out the shower pan (acrylic) to get to the subfloor and pipes, they'd need to take off the wall tile, and so he referred me to a GC.

Then I had the remodeler come out, and he basically just quoted me on redoing the shower, not including if any water damage of mold was found upon demo. \~14K plus tile/grout (\~500). 

I officially filed a claim with my insurance, and they have been pretty annoying. I want to give them some grace since central Texas did just get hit by catastrophic floods and I'm sure they are busy, but still. I uploaded everything and did a video call with the adjuster, feel like I explained my story a million times. And the adjuster basically said he was going to close the claim since there was no visible damage, but I could reopen it if I found damage. He also said that they wouldn't pay for any plumbing repair (the pipes, the entire floor of the shower) but only anything that got water damaged. He also insinuated that if any mold was found they likely wouldn't cover any of it b/c then they would say it had been going on too long. 

I've also contacted the builder, but obviously the warranty was over long ago. I have about 3 weeks until the statute of limitations for bringing suit against faulty construction comes due, and I am reaching out to an atty to get some input too, because this doesn't seem like wear and tear but like something that finally broke from not being built correctly. 

Now I am having a leak detector specialist come in tomorrow to try to get me some evidence to give my insurance that water damage is likely so they can hopefully at least pay for part of this. 

One other thing - if they demo it, which they almost certainly are going to have to do, I imagine, and they find that, not only was the drain done improperly but that they didn't even waterproof the surround correctly (because why is water vapor reaching the rooms outside the shower?) then maybe I need to have them peek behind the upstairs shower's tile for that too before my 10 yr SOL is up. 

I also notice that the humidity in the bathroom stays elevated compared to the bedroom, even correcting for any temperature differential. This is despite having the exhaust fan and a small dehumidifier running almost non-stop for the past month. 

Unrelated, unless it relates to the builder being crap - in these recent storms a couple of my windows started leaking and an old roof leak came back (very tiny). The HOA is responsible for all exterior things, but they are the worst. I don't know if they windows leaked from faulty building or HOA not keeping up with exterior stuff like sealant or something. And it isn't like I own a two story ladder where I can be casually checking exterior 2nd story windows and roofing - nor do I feel I should have to for the monthly fee they get. 

I guess I am asking for any input on anyone who knows anything about building, plumbing, insurance, windows, roofs, laws around this stuff in Texas. I'm not just made of money where a 5 figure sudden repair is no big deal. :/",1,1752441106.0,homeowners,0,1.0,False

Jerry bonds with a kid over their mutual disdain for people. Elaine learns she is an emergency contact for Sue Ellen Mischke. Kramer starts a transportation service where its free if the convo is good.","One of Susan's friends is hospitalized. She drags him for a visit. It lasts a long, long time and he leaves to get food. The hospital offers free egg salad or tuna sandwiches for visitors, and the waiting room coffee is pretty solid. 

George comes back the next day as the hospital is right down the street from a client he has a meeting with. The staff asks if George is visiting someone when he starts pouring coffee and he says ""no"" and isn't served. He then says he just hasn't visited Susan's friend *yet* but is here for a visit. They seem suspicious and he swears staff are watching him (maybe the library cop??) So he goes in for a visit with the confused patient. He starts trying to build a relationship so they'll keep letting him visit. Susan meanwhile thinks that George is falling for her friend and has Florence Nightingale effect. 

Jerry is dragged along by George because ""i always do better in a crowd. 1 on 1, I'm very tense. Like a coiled spring. I need a buffer, someone to break the silence with anything. A bad joke, inane ramblings..."" ""so you chose me?!""

Jerry waits outside the room at one point and is seated by the patient's nephew. The nephew is as unhappy as Jerry. Jerry and the kid roll their eyes at the same obnoxious person and Jerry makes a comment. They start talking and Jerry realizes they both just hate people. They bond. Jerry mentions it to his girlfriend and she takes that as a sign that he wants kids. 

Elaine runs into the gang at the hospital one day. She was called because Sue Ellen Mischke got in a car crash and for some reason Elaine was her emergency contact. 

Elaine is confused because they are more enemy than frenemy and thinks it was done purely to inconvenience her. She tries to determine if that's the case or if sue Ellen actually wants to he friends. Either way she wants to subtly convince her to not have her as am emergency contact anymore. Elaine tries to demonstrate her own lack of responsibility and unreliability, but ends up getting herself in trouble at work. 

Kramer offers a stranger a ride when they mistake his car for a cab. The conversation is stimulating. The guy offers him $20 but Kramer says the conversation was worth it.

I spent the first half of the summer traveling internationally before coming back to the US.

**About the Trip/Disclaimer** - this was ""part 2"" of my first trip around the world, after 3.5 weeks in South Korea that I posted about [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lv3y0j/trip_report_35_weeks_in_south_korea/). My original plan for this ""leg"" of the trip was the MUCH MORE REASONABLE idea of visiting two or three Balkan countries, but I was invited to an event in Lyon that I really wanted to attend. Normally I'm more of a ‚ú®slow traveler‚ú®, but I thought, ""what the hell, it'll be fun to try and cover so much distance by land."" Even so, I know this itinerary is a bit bonkers in places lol so that's the disclaimer. 

**Itinerary**

**Skopje (2 days)** - I'd heard kind of mixed reviews on Skopje before visiting, but I found it to be an interesting, fun, eclectic city, very affordable, some great food, and slightly ""gritty"" but not in a bad or uncomfortable way. Not hard to find local restaurants with live folk music oriented towards what seemed to be a mostly local audience, which was great. Also went in without really realizing how much of a Muslim community there is in Skopje, and it was really cool to hear so many calls-to-prayer, something I'd not heard in European cities before.

**Lake Ohrid (2 days)** - because my original plan had been a ""Balkans trip,"" I did want to spend a bit more time lingering in North Macedonia before heading off. Parts of Ohrid's old town felt slightly tourist trap-y but I didn't have to walk too far to get away from that, and it was a nice relaxing place. And the bus ride from Skopje to Ohrid and back was a nice way to see more of the scenery in the country

**Skopje (with daytrip: hiking near Tetovo) (2 days)** From Skopje, I took a bus to Tetovo for the day. Tetovo itself didn't strike me as super interesting, though its ""colorful mosque"" was pretty. BUT the hiking nearby was gorgeous. I just picked a few random nearby mountain villages to walk to, and it ended up being a truly beautiful day, and one of the highlights of the whole summer. Some lovely farmland in the mountains, the villages themselves were gorgeous, and the mountain scenery was also beautiful. It was an absolute whopper of a hike, little over 14 miles, by far the longest distance I've hiked in a day. Partly for the kinda dumb reason that near the end I just walked for a while until a cab came by to take me back to the Tetovo bus station. 

**Skopje to Ljubljana via Belgrade** I originally wanted to take several days in Bosnia + Herzegovina en route to Slovenia, but I was having a hell of a difficult time finding public transit links to Sarajevo from Skopje. Maybe there are routes that I just couldn't figure out? Anyway, by contrast, it was easy to find Flixbus bus tickets to Belgrade, but I wasn't all that hyped about Belgrade. So I made the questionable choice of (1) early AM bus departing from Skopje to Belgrade, and then (2) another bus leaving that same night and running overnight from Belgrade to Ljubljana. Kinda stupidly this meant 7 hours on a bus from Skopje to Belgrade, about nine hours in Belgrade, and then another 7 hours of overnight bus ride from Belgrade to Ljubljana. This added up to...really a lot of time on buses, and one of the more grueling public transit days of the trip. IDK, it was kind of an adventure at the same time. Bus #1 from Skopje to Belgrade gave me a chance to see some Serbian towns in passing. In Belgrade I went to a random free classical music concert, which turned out to be a performance by some child prodigies, slightly odd but kinda fun. And I visited Belgrade fortress before going back to the bus station for bus #2. I managed to get some sleep for the second overnight bus from there to Ljubljana, but was fucking wiped out the next day. Worth it? IDK, maybe I could've done this part in a smarter/less masochistic way. But I'm glad to have spent more time in North Macedonia even if it meant rushing through Serbia afterwards

**Ljubljana with day trip to Postojna (two days)** - I liked Ljubljana despite being pretty tired after powering through those back-to-back bus rides. Ljubljana was a cute, peaceful, walkable, approachable little city, kinda touristy but not in a depressing way. The day trip to Postojna cave was really cool even if very crowded, and the nearby cliffside castle was also beautiful if a bit logistically odd to get to without a car.

**Milan (one day)** - I'd previously been to Italy for a month-long trip (and a more reasonably paced one than this lol), so this time I was just using Milan as a one-night stopover en route to Lyon. Milan honestly isn't my favorite place in Italy but I enjoyed having some Italian food again, and had more time to wander around compared to last time I passed through Milan. Last time I was in Milan was also in February 2020, right around the time that northern Italy's covid outbreak started, so I enjoyed passing through Italy in a less grim time.

**Lyon (three days)** - this part of the trip was mostly non-solo, but I did do a bit of ""tourist stuff"" on my own including a nice walk through the old town and up to the hilltop cathedral. I took a ""rest day"" here as well given the pace I'd been moving at. I liked Lyon, it felt pretty down-to-earth and I'm a sucker for a place with a nice river running through a city.

**Malbun, Liechtenstein (3 days)** - due to some screwups on my end and some public transit delays as well, getting here from Lyon was a bit of a mess, but once I arrived, I *loved* it here. And taking trains across Switzerland was a nice callback to my first-ever substantial international trip, which was a non-solo trip to Switzerland. Anyway, I loved Malbun in Liechtenstein! It's a small village up in the mountains, superb base for insanely beautiful hiking, and a lovely place to relax and read and unwind. Aside from the painfully expensive cost of food here, this was another highlight of the trip, and the hike I did in this area is one of the most beautiful experiences I've had when traveling, anywhere. 

**Hall-in-Tirol, Austria (three days)** - a kinda chill small town close to Innsbruck but a bit smaller and more relaxed. I did a bit more (short) hiking around here, enjoyed some food and sampled some Austrian schnapps with a drunk Austrian old lady, and took the ""top of Innsbruck"" cablecar for a kind of expensive but still cool look at the town (and the mountains) from above. It was refreshingly pretty easy to get here from Liechtenstein, and not as expensive an area as I was worried, at least compared to Liechtenstein.

**Zagreb, Croatia (one day)** - I had non-solo plans to meet a loved one for a week in coastal Croatia, so I started making my way there. I took my first ever sleeper train from Innsbruck to Zagreb. I spent the extra money for a private car on the sleeper train and the novelty of it was fun even if the rocking of the train meant I didn't actually sleep that much. Still, the sleeper train felt pretty luxurious compared to the overnight bus from earlier on this same trip. Zagreb was sweltering on the day I was there, and more of a stopover destination for this trip, and other than a bit of wandering around I mostly took it easy here and rested. 

**Trogir, Croatia (one day)** - this town has a really beautiful if sometimes crowded old town, and is a nice place to relax and chill by the water. Sunset was gorgeous here and it was one of the last solo days of the trip so I enjoyed that.

**Dubrovnik, Korcula, and Cavtat, Croatia (~1 week)** - this part was non-solo so I'll mostly skip it. But, after weeks of traveling on my own, it was great to spend some time with someone I've traveled with many times before, share some travel stories, and relax in some beautiful places. Nice to do some swimming and/or wading on the hot days too.

**Dubrovnik to Skopje via Pristina** - this was another of my craziest transit days. It took me kind of a lot of time to figure out a reasonable way to get back to Skopje for my flight out, and this was the best I could come up with overland. The first bus was a long overnight ride from Dubrovnik to Pristina, Kosovo. I didn't sleep a whole lot but I enjoyed chatting with this ethnically Albanian guy from Kosovo who, among other things spoke about Bill Clinton's support for Kosovo in the 1990s. He handed out some snacks and drinks both to me and surrounding folks on the bus which was friendly of him. The bus passed through Montenegro by night, Albania mostly by night, and crossed from Albania into Kosovo by day. When not half-asleep, I enjoyed seeing more of the mountainous scenery, and enjoyed a very quick look at Pristina before catching bus #2 back to Skopje

**Skopje to home, via layover in Frankfurt** - I didn't have a ton of time in Skopje again, but enjoyed a (small) breakfast for 2 Euros, a far cry from prices elsewhere on this trip. And had some Turkish coffee as well, before catching a cab to the airport. I had an overnight layover in Frankfurt, and stayed in a hotel near there, but didn't really explore Frankfurt much. But I did realize at this point that I'd been in, or at least passed through, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, N Macedonia, and Germany in ~48 hours, which by some measures at least on paper is one of the craziest things I've done on a trip

**What went well** 

I saw a lot of beautiful places. North Macedonia was an interesting place which, at least in some areas, seemed mostly pretty distant from international mass tourism, and I'm really glad to have lingered there for a while. Liechtenstein hiking was another major highlight, and in general, I'm happy to have pushed more into hiking during my travels this year. The balance of solo time and time meeting with some friends/family was also nice especially on a longterm trip. 

I'm normally not inclined to move at this fast a pace, but I did still enjoy some really restful days. Even some of the long bus rides were kinda peaceful, I'd just read books or zone out and enjoy the scenery. Considering the distance covered, it felt doable, but it required some stubbornness and a bit of masochism. 

On the immediately preceding trip in South Korea I'd been ruminating a bit, on some days, about a painful social situation back home in Atlanta. Towards the end of this time in Europe, I surprised myself by choosing to pull the plug on that social connection completely, and it led to a brief and painful text conversation, but a lot of relief afterwards, because the dynamic there had been confusing and weird and ultimately not great. I probably wouldn't have made that choice without all this time on my own to think. Looking back on that whole situation, I think I've learned quite a bit from it. The other person could've communicated a lot better but I also could have done some things better, both for the sake of my own peace, and in terms of communication with the other person. IDK, it's nice to feel like I actually learned something from all that, and again I think the time alone helped a lot.

I enjoy trying different types of alcoholic spirits (within reason) and the Balkans in particular love their fruit brandies, so sampling some of those added some extra liveliness in the evenings sometimes. 

Though normally I wouldn't cross so many countries back-to-back, the ""cross section"" of so many different parts of Europe all in one trip was really cool, and just seeing the contrast in culture and ""vibe"" between all these different areas was really rewarding.

**What didn't go well**

A few of the longest public transit days were pretty grueling. Especially the Lyon to Liechtenstein day: I missed the first train by like 5 fucking minutes, then the next train was substantially delayed, so I got to Liechtenstein much later than expected, and once I arrived I realized I hadn't brought the right kind of power adapter for Liechtenstein. These little things can pile up and feel demoralizing when on your own so that day in particular just sucked. 

There was a pretty intense heat wave coming through Europe for parts of this trip, which didn't necessarily ruin things, but it did mean I spent less time outdoors in some areas.

With more time I could've done this same itinerary and just taken more time to chill out along the way. I had a concrete commitment back in the US that constrained the timing a bit, and made the trip more intense than it would've been otherwise. 

**Safety**

Never really felt any danger of robbery or scams or whatever.

But one thing did happen that actually could've had pretty serious consequences: I hike a lot, but it's been a long time since I've hiked in a place where tick-borne illness is a major concern. Because of this, I honestly just didn't think to research it, but I ended up getting a tick bite in a VERY UNFORTUNATE PLACE while hiking in Austria. Austrian ticks have decently high rates of tickborne encephalitis, a disease I'd never even heard of because it hasn't really reached the US. Tourists hiking in Austria are advised to get vaccinated for that disease, but I wasn't vaccinated since I hadn't even thought to research this. The tick bite was ~2 weeks ago, and I still have no symptoms, which means I'm *hopefully* not gonna get any disease, but I feel kinda dumb and tbh a bit irresponsible for not even thinking about this in advance...so this is your PSA: if hiking in Europe, do your research about tick safety in the countries you're visiting!!!! One other more minor hiking note: if planning to hike in Liechtenstein as I did, and especially if wanting to do routes higher in the mountains, I'd advise not jumping into it unless if you're a reasonably experienced/sure-footed hiker. 

The only other safety ""incident"" was when my cab driver in Milan almost got into a road-rage brawl with a cyclist :| they actually did exchange a few blows through the open window and the cyclist was trying to pull the driver-side door open. I guess direct risk to me was low, but it was still something I've never experienced before. Never had anything like that happen on my prior trip to Italy, probably the sort of thing that could happen anywhere with some bad luck.

**Logistical stuff**

Some of the buses especially in North Macedonia varied in comfort level and amenities at least by European standards. One of the local ""buses"" was more a sort of cramped van, and even some of the long-distance international buses in the Balkans didn't have bathrooms, though they made bathroom stops at least (Serbian bus stop bathrooms win the prize for grossest I've seen in Europe) Also, even with fully prepaid bus tickets, in North Macedonia and iirc Serbia, I had to pay a small extra fee to print an extra ""ticket"" just for access to the bus-boarding area. Kinda weird?

Flixbus, Omio, and Girafa Travel were the websites where I found and/or booked most of the international bus and train routes. The normally reliable Rome2Rio didn't always line up with the bus routes that are currently running, at least for a few legs of this trip.

In North Macedonia, I booked a cab that barely worked. The cab driver had me literally get out and push to get the cab started. Not a huge issue, but it was funny and honestly kind of amazing.

Ultimately, covering this much distance by land was a fun ""adventure"" even if it was honestly a bit grueling at times. I'm glad to have done it and felt legitimately proud when I got back to Skopje at the end. That being said, I think next year I'll spend the summer in two or three countries instead of ten.",1,1752440627.0,solotravel,0,1.0,False

We got by with our little single-burner butane stove, but went through four butane canisters on the trip overall.

1lz3soc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1lz3soc/a_time_when_a_shared_dream_became_physical_i_cant/,A time when a shared dream became physical (I can't explain this one),"This was an experience I shared with my partner, and it was very bizarre. It ties in to false awakening. This is a real story, and the only reason I'm sharing it in this sub and not just some paranormal sub is because it has to do with a shared FA, and I figured it might be interesting to some here. Frankly this is the type of story I usually chose not to share because it makes you come off delulu, making stuff up, causes you to lose credibility and so on. In any case, I don't care, so here it goes:

Me and my partner are in bed sleeping. We both hear someone knocking on the door, and it wakes us up. I'm half awake, but my wife just gets up and goes to answer the door. I look at my phone, and it's like 2 AM. I yell at her -""Why the Hell are you opening the door at 2 am?! Are you crazy?!"" (she some times sleep walks). I follow after my wife, and the girl is actually opening the front door. Before I can get there, I just see a guy standing on the street looking at us, he wasn't really at the door, more on the actual street past our garden. Really weird looking guy.

My wife is not responding to me, she's just standing at the door looking at him. All of a sudden, the weird guy ""rushes"" in to our house, goes right through my wife. Immediately when this happens, we both wake up and our 3 dogs are losing their mind. We have 3 shiba inus, which if you don't know, they don't bark, they scream really loud. So we both just jolt awake, and I thought someone broke in to the house, so I grab a gun and go in to the living room. I still had that weird dream in my head, but at this point I thought I just had a really disturbing nightmare. The dogs are all barking at our trash can, of all things.

We have one of those electronic trash cans. The type where it's really heavy, made out of metal, and you can't just ""open it"". To open the trash can, it requires you to place your hand over a sensor, located on the top of the can, this is to avoid having to touch the can. After a while that you do that, and it opens, a few seconds later it closes on it's own. So I come in to the kitchen, I look at the trash can, and it's open. The dogs are barking at it, losing their mind. The can then closes on it's own, as it's designed to do. I search the house, I look for an intruder, but I can't find anyone. So I assume maybe a rat got in the house.

I look through the can, trying to see if I can find a rat, nothing. I check the house, try to be quiet and listen to see if I can hear a rat going through our house, nothing. So I say screw it, and go back to bed. I lay down in bed and my wife apologizes. I say, hu? She says, -"" I thought it was UPS and it was my amazon package"". I ask her what the hell she's talking about again, and she is clearly half awake-half a sleep. That freaked me out, but I figured - Maybe she just heard me getting up or something, and dreamed that she told me to go check, I don't know. I'm tired, half awake, my heart is racing because I thought I was about to have to kill someone, so I just want to go back to sleep.

Next morning, I wake up and my wife is not sleeping next to me, which is odd, I always wake up first. I go to the kitchen and she's there drinking her coffee, doesn't look well. I ask her if she's ok, she tells me she had a really bad nightmare. I told her I also did, and I thought someone broke in to the house, but the dogs were just being annoying. She looks at me with a weird face and tells me, what do you mean? I told her that the dogs started barking like crazy last night, don't you remember? I even got up and went to check. She then tells me she had a really bad nightmare, where she woke up to answer the door and a really weird guy was standing out in the street, then all of a sudden, he rushed in to the house. So you can imagine how I felt hearing that, my heart sank to stomach. I told her I had the same dream, and we both decide we are going to sage our house that day.

I am then cutting the back yard grass that same morning, and I notice our shed is open. Here's what you gotta understand about our shed - It's bolt locked. Neither me or my wife ever use the shed, we just mostly store firewood in there, some camping stuff, and it's fairly small. It's not like a huge barn or something. The shed does have a strong, heavy, rusted lock, but it's not designed to keep people out. It's hard to describe the mechanism, but it's basically a bolt that locks it in place, but if anything with thumbs and a good amount of strength wants to open it, they can. It's not like it requires a key or something to unlock, just hands and strength. You gotta twist the metal open that locks it and pull the bolt, then open the 2 doors. Anyway, it's open. I have never found my shed open, ever, because the lock is so heavy. Yes, some times we have foxes and racoons, my logical answer is that it was an animal. My dog also keeps avoiding the shed, one of them usually likes to sleep next to it for shade, but he will not go near it. I'm assuming because he can smell an animal was there last night, and he's afraid or something, even though he's a hunting dog and the issue is usually the opposite. My dogs always kill the bunnies that come in to our yard, it's pretty depressing.

Anyway, I close it and assume it was a fox or something. The following evening, my wife is still at work and I'm on my computer working. All of a sudden someone is banging on my door, I go answer it and it's my neighbor. My neighbor tells me my dog got lose and is running around the neighborhood. This has NEVER happened before, in years of living here. The backyard has a door that locks in a similar way to the shed, you need thumbs to open it. It's also super high, the dong can't reach it. I think to my self, this damn fox is really being annoying... Maybe it unlocked the door yesterday and I just didn't notice, so when I let the dog in to the backyard, it just got out because the door was already open. I chase my dog for an hour, finally get him, and put him back inside the house. My neighbor gives me a spare lock he has, and I put it on the backyard door.

Following night, I get home from work. Before letting my dogs out, I go check to see if the door is still locked, because shiba inus, if don't know, once they escape, you will likely never see them again. I go to check and there it is again, the shed is wide open. You gotta understand that it's not just that you have to ""unlock"" the shed, the doors don't just open when you unlock it, you have to actually use force to then pull both doors open. Even if an animal did that, which I'm sure that's what it was, it wouldn't really open the doors like that. It would likely just have opened one, or made a small entrance and got out, the door would be half open, not wide open like a storm did it. So at this point I'm bothered, but It's just an animal, so I'm not losing my mind. I figure over the weekend I'll go to the hardware store and buy a lock or something, what ever. Couple nights go by, and one day I'm sleeping. I then hear from outside the shed door slam. My room has a window that looks out at the backyard, so we can hear pretty easy, but the shed is on the other side behind the house, in other words, out of view. The way it slammed open, I was sure it was a person. I assumed it was a homeless person sleeping in my shed, since it gets pretty cold during winter.

Again, I go out there with a gun, hoping I don't get shanked. I look in to the shed with a flashlight, nothing. Even the logs look unturned. The back yard door is also closed and still locked. Here's the other weird thing, if it was a person, that shed has camping supplies, and a really nice weather proof pop up tent. If I was homeless, that's the first thing I would steal, but nothing was ever stolen. Also, you can't slam these doors open like that, it has to be a huge animal or human, not a fox or a racoon, and we just don't have that here. I don't live in the country side, it's just a suburb. This happens enough times that me and my wife are thinking about buying a camera.

Finally, I buy a lock for the shed, one that requires a key. That same night, we both hear what sounds like something trying to open it, like yanking it open. I go outside, again expecting to see an animal, nothing. I get so paranoid I file a police report, and a cop actually comes over. I tell him what's been going on, and I'm concerned maybe it's a person breaking in to my yard, and ask if anyone else reported this. He said no, the neighborhood is really safe and nothing happens there usually, certainly nothing like this. He also tells me it's just an animal.

So me and my wife are deciding what camera to get, and we are debating on getting like a smart house type security system, where everything is watched from our phone. How ever, since the night we put the lock there, it just stopped happening. That was the end of it. We have had weird things happen in our house everywhere we lived, but I felt this one was interesting because we shared in a dream, where we both had a false awakening event, and then something physical coincidentally happened and kept happening.

Did we just share a weird dream? probably. Did the trash can malfunction or was it maybe a rat? sure, maybe. Was it an animal opening the shed? probably. I just thought I'd share. Sorry if it was to off topic for this sub, again, the only reason I posted here is because I thought the shared false awakening event was interesting, I didn't know that could happen. My wife has had very weird dreams since the day we moved in to this house a few years a go, dreams that are really disturbing and I don't even want to share because it's so over the top. Why not move out? Cause we like our house.

No the story does not have a more incredible ending where a priest came over and had to perform an exorcism on the shed or something, lol. It ended just like that.

If this story doesn‚Äôt belong on this sub, that‚Äôs completely fine. I just figured some might find it interesting. Especially sharing a false awakening with the same premise, I find that wild. ",2,1752440527.0,AstralProjection,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a hot beverage dispenser involves careful consideration of several key features that directly impact its performance and suitability for a breakfast buffet setting.

**Capacity:** the capacity of a beverage dispenser is a crucial aspect to evaluate. Larger capacity dispensers reduce the frequency of refills during peak breakfast hours. Look for models with a minimum capacity of 3 gallons (approximately 48 cups) to minimize disruptions. Certain high-volume options can even exceed 5 gallons.

The capacity directly impacts the operational efficiency of the buffet. A smaller capacity dispenser will require frequent refills, perhaps leading to longer wait times for guests and increased labor costs. Larger capacity units, while initially more expensive, can offer long-term cost savings and improved customer satisfaction by streamlining the service process.

**Temperature control:** Precise temperature control is essential for maintaining the quality and flavor of hot beverages. Dispensers with adjustable thermostats and digital displays provide accurate temperature settings to prevent overheating or under-heating. Ideally, dispensers should maintain a temperature range of 150-180¬∞F (65-82¬∞C) for optimal coffee and tea service.

Maintaining the correct temperature not only impacts the flavor but also prevents potential safety hazards. Overheated beverages can cause burns, while under-heated beverages may not be adequately sanitized. Accurate temperature control ensures a safe and enjoyable experience for all guests.

**Insulation:** Effective insulation is key to minimizing heat loss and maintaining consistent beverage temperatures for extended periods. Double-walled construction with vacuum insulation or high-density foam insulation is preferable. This will reduce energy consumption and prolong the usability of each dispensed batch.

Adequate insulation considerably reduces energy costs by minimizing the need for constant reheating. It also contributes to a more enduring operation by reducing energy waste. Furthermore, effective insulation prevents condensation from forming on the exterior of the dispenser, maintaining a clean and professional appearance.

**Material and Durability:** The construction material significantly impacts the dispenser's durability and longevity.Stainless steel is a popular choice for its resistance to corrosion, ease of cleaning, and sleek aesthetic.look for dispensers with heavy-duty stainless steel construction in both the inner tank and the exterior housing to withstand the high-traffic demands of a breakfast buffet.

Choosing durable materials reduces the frequency of replacements and minimizes maintenance costs. Stainless steel not only provides resistance to corrosion but also inhibits the growth of bacteria, ensuring a sanitary surroundings for beverage dispensing.Additionally, high-quality materials contribute to a more professional and polished presentation.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Proper hygiene is paramount in a buffet setting. Dispensers should be designed for easy disassembly and cleaning. Removable drip trays, spigots, and internal components facilitate thorough sanitation. Opt for models with dishwasher-safe parts to minimize labor and ensure consistent cleanliness.

Dispensers that are easy to clean reduce the risk of cross-contamination and maintain a sanitary environment. Regular cleaning not only protects the health of guests but also extends the lifespan of the dispenser by preventing the buildup of mineral deposits and other residues.

**Spigot Design:** The spigot design influences the ease of dispensing and prevents drips. Look for self-closing spigots that minimize spills and waste. Drip trays are also essential for capturing any stray drips and maintaining a clean dispensing area. Certain models feature adjustable spigot heights to accommodate different cup sizes.

A well-designed spigot ensures a smooth and controlled dispensing process, reducing the risk of accidents and spills.self-closing mechanisms prevent staff or customers from accidentally leaving the spigot open, leading to significant wastage.Adjustable spigot heights accommodate various cup sizes, reducing splashing and improving the overall dispensing experience.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right hot beverage dispenser provides several tangible benefits for your breakfast buffet.

**Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Offering a consistent supply of hot, flavorful beverages significantly enhances customer satisfaction. Dispensers with accurate temperature control and effective insulation ensure that beverages remain at optimal serving temperatures throughout the breakfast service. This results in a more enjoyable and fulfilling dining experience for your guests.

Providing high-quality hot beverages is a key differentiator in a competitive market. A well-maintained and efficient beverage station can significantly improve customer perception and encourage repeat business.

**Reduced Labor Costs:** Larger capacity dispensers with efficient temperature control features reduce the need for frequent refills and monitoring. This frees up staff to focus on other essential tasks, such as attending to customer needs and maintaining the overall cleanliness of the buffet area.

By automating the beverage dispensing process to some extent, labor costs can be reduced significantly. The savings achieved can be reinvested into other areas of the business, improving overall profitability.

**Improved Operational Efficiency:** Dispensers designed for easy cleaning and maintenance minimize downtime and streamline operational workflows. Models with removable components and dishwasher-safe parts can be quickly and efficiently sanitized, ensuring a smooth and hygienic beverage service.

Efficient operation translates into faster service times and reduced customer wait times. This contributes to a more positive and hassle-free dining experience.

**Waste Reduction:** Self-closing spigots and drip trays minimize spills and waste, reducing product costs and promoting a more sustainable operation. Dispensers with accurate temperature control also help prevent beverages from spoiling due to overheating or under-heating.

Reducing waste not only saves money but also enhances the business's environmental obligation. This resonates positively with increasingly environmentally conscious customers.**Consistent Beverage Quality:** Temperature control ensures that coffee, tea, and other hot beverages are consistently served at the optimal temperature. This control is essential for maintaining the intended flavor profile and preventing beverages from becoming bitter or stale.

Consistent beverage quality builds brand reputation and customer loyalty, leading to increased revenue in the long term.

## FAQs Section

**How often should hot beverage dispensers be cleaned?**
Hot beverage dispensers should be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each service period,typically after breakfast hours.rinse the unit daily to remove any excess coffee. A more detailed cleaning, including disassembly of components, should be done at least once a week, or more frequently during periods of heavy use.

**Are stainless steel dispensers prone to staining or corrosion?**
High-quality stainless steel is resistant to staining and corrosion, but improper cleaning or the use of abrasive cleaners can damage the surface. Always use mild detergents and avoid harsh chemicals. Regular cleaning will prevent the buildup of mineral deposits and maintain the dispenser's appearance.

**Can I use a single dispenser for different types of beverages (e.g., coffee, tea, hot chocolate)?**
While it is indeed possible to use a single dispenser for different beverages, it is not recommended. The residue from one beverage can affect the taste of another.Ideally, dedicate separate dispensers for each beverage type to maintain optimal flavor and prevent cross-contamination.

**What are the best practices for maintaining beverage temperature in a dispenser?**
Ensure that the dispenser is preheated before adding the beverage.use the adjustable thermostat to set the desired temperature and monitor it regularly with a thermometer. Avoid opening the dispenser frequently, as this can lead to heat loss. Regularly inspect and replace any worn-out seals or insulation to maintain optimal performance.

1lz3ooa,https://www.reddit.com/r/agoraphobic_archives/comments/1lz3ooa/the_home_i_dropped_out_of_college_to_work_at_an/,"The Home (I dropped out of college to work at an Old-Folks Home, and now I can't sleep at night)","This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.¬† Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn‚Äôt own a lot, and anyway, I wasn‚Äôt coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of¬†*Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn‚Äôt like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn‚Äôt. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn‚Äôt bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn‚Äôt been updated since the 80‚Äôs, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn‚Äôt too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA‚Äôs, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident‚Äôs beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly.¬†

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I‚Äôve never told anyone:

I‚Äôm terrified of old people.

I don‚Äôt know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it‚Äôs just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn‚Äôt bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading¬†*Salem‚Äôs Lot*¬†by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn‚Äôt need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA‚Äôs, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn‚Äôt want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch¬†*Supernatural.*¬†Sometimes we‚Äôd shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched¬†*Nosferatu*¬†at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria‚Äôs are garbage, but the Home‚Äôs food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA‚Äôs and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn‚Äôt for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they‚Äôd quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn‚Äôt complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing¬†*Elden Ring*¬†and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn‚Äôt have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn‚Äôt mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn‚Äôt want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn‚Äôt looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my¬†*Beserk*¬†brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn‚Äôt know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into¬†*Beserk*¬†too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. ‚ÄúFor shift exchanges,‚Äù she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying ‚Äúsure.‚Äù I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn‚Äôt have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we‚Äôd play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn‚Äôt have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I‚Äôd ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn‚Äôt really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA‚Äôs hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn‚Äôt talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn‚Äôt really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That‚Äôs when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won‚Äôt go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don‚Äôt know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena‚Äôs phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena‚Äôs name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn‚Äôt respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she‚Äôd ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn‚Äôt risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn‚Äôt hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

‚ÄúGet up. Get over it. You have a life to live,‚Äù she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn‚Äôt a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena‚Äôs apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn‚Äôt want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn‚Äôt true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don‚Äôt think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a ‚ÄúLena‚Äù living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I¬†*knew*¬†I wasn‚Äôt crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn‚Äôt said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for:¬†

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn‚Äôt a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn‚Äôt do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss‚Äôs office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home‚Äôs records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.¬† I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss‚Äôs door was locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA‚Äôs about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read ‚Äúarchived footage‚Äù. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said ‚ÄúFootage moved to Secondary Storage.‚Äù

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren‚Äôt allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn‚Äôt closed the camera window.

She didn‚Äôt look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

‚ÄúI always forget the damn spoon.‚Äù

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA‚Äôs in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren‚Äôt usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that¬† I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss‚Äôs keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn‚Äôt even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet‚Äôs handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn‚Äôt recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.¬† I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don‚Äôt know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn‚Äôt care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn‚Äôt say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn‚Äôt go home. I didn‚Äôt trust my apartment was safe.¬†

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS‚Äôs and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled ‚ÄúLena‚Äù and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn‚Äôt remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn‚Äôt turn. It didn‚Äôt look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena‚Äôs neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms began to expand and contort. Lena‚Äôs body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs fingers and into her body.¬†

Lena‚Äôs body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena‚Äôs mouth was open in a scream I couldn‚Äôt hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn‚Äôt look away. I hated it, but I couldn‚Äôt stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word ‚ÄúEvidence‚Äù written on it.

I was a coward. I should‚Äôve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should‚Äôve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I‚Äôve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don‚Äôt require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don‚Äôt ask questions.

But I know now I haven‚Äôt run far enough. For the past month, I‚Äôve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last.

There‚Äôs a reason I haven‚Äôt said the location of the Home, or even which state it‚Äôs in.

I can‚Äôt remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can‚Äôt even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there‚Äôs a blank space where it should be.

I can‚Äôt find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm going crazy.

But I know it‚Äôs real. I can‚Äôt forget what I‚Äôve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it‚Äôs only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can‚Äôt say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It‚Äôs like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can‚Äôt sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

1lz3mfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GBDA/comments/1lz3mfk/a_frank_experience_tips_for_gbda_and_university/,A Frank Experience & Tips for GBDA and University Life as a recent GBDA graduate,"As a recent GBDA graduate, I‚Äôd like to share my experiences and tips for navigating the program and university life. This overview covers my GBDA journey, recommendations for free activities and local restaurants, specific class advice, general degree insights, and personal reflections I wish I‚Äôd known at 18.

 Disclaimer: My opinions‚Äîespecially on food‚Äîmay differ from others. This post reflects my perspective alone. If I‚Äôve missed anything, feel free to add suggestions below. 

GBDA Experience & Academic Tips 

GBDA offers significant software and skill variety, making it a worthwhile investment... if you enjoy learning new tools. Be prepared for limited hand-holding from professors‚Äîsuccess depends on self-advocacy. Professors Terry and Achenbach stood out as exceptional. Team projects are frequent, so prioritize building a positive reputation; peers will choose partners based on perceived reliability (e.g., avoiding those rumored to slack). 

For electives, smaller classes often mean better professor rapport, leading to higher grades. Simple gestures like consistently greeting professors or answering questions can set you apart‚Äî80% of students don‚Äôt do this. Building a repor with your professor is worth its weight in gold for when you need to be granted leeway for mistakes and assignment help.  

Class-Specific Advice: 

Film/Video/Photoshop: Rely on YouTube tutorials. Master 4‚Äì5 specific techniques not covered in class and apply them to projects. Take the Photoshop elective and focus on the writing first, then build the image around it. 
Business/Marketing: Prioritize exams. Use Pomodoro study sessions, flashcards, and ChatGPT for multiple-choice prep.  
UX/UI: Master auto-layouts on figma, layer organization, and spacing via YouTube tutorials‚Äîessential for the degree.  
Quantitative Statistics: It‚Äôs manageable with consistent effort, ei. Watch tutorials and study with a friend.  

Social & Cohort Dynamics:

Our cohort varies yearly on personality but usually splits into business-focused and design-focused students, plus the high/low achievers of those two groups.  Avoid limiting social circles to roommates. Most co-op students enter marketing, digital media, or UX/UI roles.  

Exchange Programs:
I highly recommend exchanges, especially to the UK. The culture is lively, courses are relaxed, and travel via Ryanair is convenient (e.g., Manchester). However, prioritize easy courses and triple-check credit transfers with UW‚ÄîI had to take an extra course abroad. Note: UK food is often underwhelming, beige with a side of beige, so cook greens yourself if you‚Äôre health-conscious.  

Food Recommendations in waterloo/kitchener
Top Tier:
- Champas Kitchen (affordable, amazing mom-and-pop).  
- Ken‚Äôs sushi (pricey but worth occasional splurges).  
- King Katsu (Kitchener-based gem).  
- Caf√© 33 (great coffee, atmosphere).  
- Four All Ice Cream (Waterloo‚Äôs best).  
- Kebab Hut (delicious kebabs/rice).  
- Sowan Korean Dining (excellent fried chicken).  

Mid Tier:  
Tim Hortons (fast, cheap; burnt coffee but good Ice Capps).  
- Fat Bastard Burritos ($20, filling).  
- D Spot Desserts (wide selection but crowded/pricey).  
Fuwa Fuwa (quality shaved ice; limited seating).  
- Beertown, Abe Erb, Pure & Simple (ideal for groups, but declining quality for the price).  

Avoid(Do not flame me):
- Lazeez.
Campus Pizza (poor quality; Pizza Nova nearby is better).  
- Jugo Juice (mostly apple juice, overpriced).  

Waterloo Life & Activities:  
Free/Low-Cost: WUSA events, Blue Jays games (discounted bus+ticket), free dance lessons in the square, pop-up markets, and library perks (free Switch games, park passes, board games like Potion Explosion or Jamaica).  
Fitness: The Group Fitness Pass (yoga, spin, barre) is unmatched value.  
Clubs: I didn't really participate in clubs, and if you're living in stratford, you can bet you won't be able to do most of the club circuit due to distance. I tried the ""Art Club,"" but that leans to extremely anime-focused; GBDA Artist Collective is better for creatives.  
Nature: Elora Gorge is a beauty and other conservation parks.  
Nightlife: I found the clubs here to often have lackluster music and passive crowds; house parties are hit-or-miss.  The Drink Uptown is usually the best value, and I hope on that guest list if you can.
Haircuts: Ginas hair school is quite good and done by students, but they are just as good

Stratford Campus Considerations
Are you thinking of living in Stratford? Many students I know enjoy its artistic, kind community, but it lacks nightlife and affordable food. Groceries require a car (Walmart is a 40-minute highway walk). There isn't a great public transport. And rent is pricier, though 3-person setups help. Winter is brutal‚Äîheavy snow, poor plowing, and extreme cold. It is in the middle of a snow belt. I strongly advise against winter stays. No Uber exists; the shuttle bus (now available) or carpooling is essential. Always have a local friend for emergencies. Activities are limited: walks by the lake, gym, reading, or student-priced Shakespeare tickets (rare). I really wouldn't recommend it as you will remove yourself from university life entirely and can feel isolated. I know people that it worked out for them, but the Uni makes it seem easier than what it is. 

Social/Dating Advice
Avoid dating within your cohort early term‚Äîbreakups complicate group projects. If you must, date outside your year. Prioritize partners who actively choose and adore you. Reject people-pleasing; it undermines confidence. Listen more than you speak, and avoid oversharing or trauma-dumping; it‚Äôs often inappropriate and passive-aggressive.  

General Life Tips
- Social Media: Block rage-baiters/drainers immediately; don‚Äôt feed their revenue.  
- Conflict: Remember others‚Äô behavior reflects their issues, not yours.  
- Health: Consistent portion control and a Mediterranean diet work best. Learn cooking basics via ""Binging with Babish,"" then advance to Bon App√©tit or Serious Eats. Aim for 2‚Äì3 weekly gym sessions (20+ mins weights + cardio).  Meal prep lunches.
- Community: Volunteer, join events, help peers, and participate in ux surveys that always need support‚Äîgive without expecting returns. Cultivate hobbies that keep you fit, fed, and socially connected. Loneliness is costly.  

So would I recommend GBDA? 50/50, a lot of the courses are very surface level and broad. I've gotten completely railroaded into doing all the work for a couple of group projects. The commute is shit and horrible in the winter. I wasn't able to connect with most of my cohort, so I made friends with ppl outside GBDA. I still loved the small classes, and the profs actually do care and are always quite passionate about their work. The work and projects are fun, and I like doing new stuff. Waterloo is a great city. So I can't really say other than the most beautiful flowers are the ones you water.

On April 3^(rd) of 1978 Bravo came to Stockholm to do a photo shooting of ABBA after a long time, once more Bubi Heilemann took great pictures of ABBA. ¬†The article about the photo shooting was in Bravo nr 17(April,24 1978) and the pictures/posters was in Bravo nr 20 (May,15 1978). In the article Benny and Frida say that they are coming back from a ski vacation on Lech, Austria. ¬†Based on that I could put a date in a picture that I found at the Hotel Kristberg (Lech, Austria) website long time ago and I didn‚Äôt know when was taken. It is a picture of Benny, Frida and their friends Egon Zimmermann (World Cup¬†[alpine ski racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing)¬†and Olympic gold medalist from¬†[Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria)) and Egons‚Äô fianc√©e Charlotte Klingspor. Also is very interesting when Benny says that they are planning to get married in the summer , Frida says that this is Benny‚Äôs idea, and she is not so keen on it. Three pictures posted, first the picture of Benny, Frida, Egon Zimmermann and Charlotte in Lech doing Heli ski, probably around Easter 1978 (March, 26 of 1978). The second picture Bravo nr 17 of 1978 article and third picture the poster included in Bravo nr 20 of 1978, one of the pictures took by Bubi Heilemann on April 3^(rd) 1978 photo shooting.

BRAVO photographer Bubi Heilemann

\----

If it were up to the photographers, we wouldn't have any time left for concerts, TV appearances, and recordings. We'd have to be photographed every day. That's why we try to avoid photo shoots as much as possible,"" says Bj√∂rn.

¬†

ABBA is back in a photo studio for the first time in months. It's the first session since the birth of Peter Christian, Bj√∂rn and Anna's son. And the last one for several months...

¬†

At 11:00 sharp, Bj√∂rn and Anna arrive at the photo studio with Lars Svensson, their costume consultant. ""We almost had to cancel the session; Anna was still in bed yesterday. She had the flu. But now she's feeling better,"" reports Bj√∂rn. Anna is wearing a light leather coat with a fur collar, skin-tight yellow corduroy jeans, and a T-shirt. Bj√∂rn is casually dressed in blue jeans, a white shirt, and a black, almost floor-length coat. Lars Svensson is lugging 14 suitcases filled with the latest costumes he designed for Abba.

¬†

Five minutes later, Benny and Annafrid arrive in a dark red BMW. They've owned the car for over four years. The two look good, with a light tan. ""We just got back from vacation. We went skiing in Lech, Austria,"" they laugh. ""While we're freezing to death here in Stockholm in the ice and snow,"" Bj√∂rn and Anna say.

¬†

The mood within the group is fantastic; it's never seemed better. The two girls immediately disappear into the dressing room and apply makeup to their eyelids and lips. Annafrid powders her face. ""So the skin doesn't shine so much, it doesn't look so good in the photos,"" she explains to me.

¬†

Benny reveals a real surprise to me: ""We're planning to get married this year. In May, we'll be going to America for two weeks, doing TV shows there, giving interviews. Finally, on May 11th, we'll be in Germany for the 'Starparade'. Then, in the summer, we might go to the registry office.""

¬†

I can't believe it, but Annafrid confirms it: ""It's Benny's idea. I'm not too keen on it. After all, I've been married before. But the final word hasn't been spoken yet. Benny would really like to get married. It's his first marriage.""

¬†

Abba are changing; for nine hours ‚Äì until after 8 p.m., they patiently change costumes, pose, and laugh in front of the camera. They've brought the double LP ""Saturday Night Fever"" with them. The page with the Bee Gees songs plays over and over again for hours. Annafrid: ""That's our favorite record at the moment.""

¬†

The four of them don't even allow themselves a lunch break. Hellas, an employee of their record company, gets two hamburgers for each of them. Bj√∂rn and Benny drink beer, and Anna and Annafrid drink black coffee. In between, they sign autograph cards. Finally, it's time to call it a day. Exhausted, Anna admits: ""That was the longest photo session we've ever done. But after all, we have a special relationship with BRAVO. You were the first to show interest in us, even before we achieved great success."" Annafrid: ""And ultimately, it was BRAVO that helped me find my long-lost father, Alfred Haase.""

¬†

Finally, we get to see the recording studio that Abba is currently building for over two million German marks. It's scheduled to be completed at the beginning of May. Then Abba also plans to record their new LP here.

¬†

You'll soon be able to see the photos taken during the session in BRAVO: We're preparing a major Abba star album for issue 20...

Last month, I heard about this small caf√© owner. Super hardworking guy, running his own business, collecting GST/HST on all his sales like he‚Äôs supposed to.

Here‚Äôs the problem: every quarter, he‚Äôd look at his total sales, calculate how much GST/HST he collected, and just send that whole amount to the CRA.

He completely forgot about input tax credits ‚Äî meaning the GST/HST he‚Äôd already paid on things like coffee beans, milk, paper cups, cleaning supplies, repairs‚Ä¶basically all his business expenses.

The result?
	‚Ä¢	He overpaid CRA by more than $8,000 over two years.
	‚Ä¢	He thought he was ‚Äúplaying it safe.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Meanwhile, his cash flow was tight, and he was stressed about money.

Luckily, he figured it out and got help. Adjustments were filed, and he was able to claim back the overpaid GST/HST. But it took time, paperwork, and a ton of stress that could‚Äôve been avoided.

Takeaway:
If you‚Äôre collecting GST/HST, don‚Äôt forget your input tax credits. Every dollar of GST/HST you pay on business expenses reduces how much you owe the government. Keep good records and save yourself money.

Just wanted to share in case it helps someone avoid the same headache. If anyone‚Äôs ever confused about GST/HST or bookkeeping stuff, feel free to ask questions. Not trying to pitch services ‚Äî just here to help.",6,1752439832.0,SmallBusinessCanada,14,1.0,False

I (32F), was recently using the Salt dating app and came across the profile for a guy (32M) that I know from church years ago. Like, I've known him since I was 15/16? He still attends that church but I've since moved to a different city (only an hour away) and attend one of it's sister churches, my parents still attend that church and they know him pretty well. I used to have a bit of a crush on him when I was younger, but we didn't talk all that much, so it never really went anywhere.

I jokingly said to my mum that I'd seen him on the app and she commented that she always thought we'd make a good/interesting couple...

Anyway, I don't pay for the app and don't know if he ""liked"" me back, but we're friends on social media and I'm wondering if it would be totally weird to reach out there and mention I saw him on the app and would he like to get coffee?

I'll be traveling to Sicily this September for about 15 days, and I'd love to get your thoughts on my itinerary. I‚Äôll end the trip with 2 days in Rome before flying back home. I'm looking for a mix of adventure, beach time, and relaxation ‚Äî but without renting a car, so I'll be relying entirely on public transport.

Here‚Äôs my current plan:

-Palermo (3 nights)

Explore the city: Palermo Cathedral, Quattro Canti, Palatine Chapel, Teatro Massimo, and Mondello Beach.
Day trip: Full-day guided tour to San Vito lo Capo + Riserva dello Zingaro (swimming & hiking).


-Cefal√π (4 nights)

Travel from Palermo.
Rest days at the beach, explore the village, hike La Rocca, visit the Cathedral, and enjoy seaside dinners.


-Taormina (3 nights)

Stroll along Corso Umberto.
Visit the Greek Theatre, Isola Bella Beach, optional visit to Castelmola.

Day trip: Mount Etna + winery tour.


-Ortigia / Syracuse (2 nights)

Walk the seafront, sunset views, seafood dinner.
Explore the Duomo, Fountain of Arethusa, local market, and swim.


-Catania ‚Üí Rome

Morning train to Catania. Quick city visit (Piazza Duomo, Via Etnea, market), lunch.
Flight to Rome in the evening.


-Rome (2 nights)

Day 1: Vatican Museums, St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo.

Day 2: Relax, shop, drink coffee, and enjoy the city before flying back home.


I‚Äôd love any suggestions or improvements. Does this seem doable without a car? Are there any hidden gems or must-dos you think I shouldn‚Äôt miss?

Thanks in advance!

Went through a rough time last year, did therapy. Made me realize how individual my Austrian coping is.

First time eating with my hands was Ethiopian food in Vienna. Then learned to cook doro wat myself. The communal aspect seems so different from Austrian individualism

**Questions:**

* How do you personally get through dark periods?
* How does Ethiopian community/family support work?
* What role does coffee ceremony play in healing?

Planning to travel and understand these differences. Any advice on:

* How to respectfully discuss struggles with Ethiopians?
* Orthodox Christian/cultural sensitivities I should know?
* Best ways to connect with real families?

It‚Äôs been hard to meet people outside of work, and I‚Äôd really love to find a sweet girl friend (not romantic, just a friend!) to grab coffee with, chat about life, maybe try new cafes or explore the city a bit together. Someone to laugh with and share storiesü•≤you know, just those little things that make life warmer.

I‚Äôm 25, easy-going, love long walks, deep talks, good coffee, and discovering cozy spots around the city. If you‚Äôre also looking for a new friend or just someone to hang out with occasionally, feel free to message me! ü´∂",11,1752439647.0,stuttgart,16,0.87,False

Outside I look, and I see, through the waving branches with flowing leaves, I see him. He was walking, maybe even running, no, he was doing neither, he was driving. He had walked to his car, I saw that too, that‚Äôs why I got confused. So through my window I saw him get into his car and drive, and he drove away to someplace, I don‚Äôt know where. And I looked, as I watched him drive away, at the lady sitting next to him in the front seat. I wanted to be in the back seat so I could see them both better, so I wouldn‚Äôt be here by myself, but then I see the car pull away, without me, to a place I couldn‚Äôt see.¬†

I shove him down the stairwell and the rest of them quickly follow. Someone tied a string around their bellies, it wasn‚Äôt me, that‚Äôs what I would tell her if she saw me, but she doesn‚Äôt, she‚Äôs somewhere down the stairs, probably on the couch, sleeping. He is thrown off the mountain and he hits every step on the way down until he lands in a small field of rice, and the others fall also, but the string is too big, and they do not all fall, as I wish they had, but slip down the steps, bruising their behinds instead, when most should be dead.¬†

He gets up again uninjured but then trips and falls, I push him, and this time he goes all the way down. His head hits the wall, and I get scared because it makes a large thump thump thump on the way down, and the rest follow, and I don‚Äôt remember if she was still here or not, hopefully she‚Äôs not, hopefully she‚Äôs in a place where she couldn‚Äôt hear that. I would ask Tony but he‚Äôs not here, right now, or then, I look up at the light of the stairwell and I see a shadow, but it was not mine, mine would not sneak across the wall like that. Tony is that you, wait who am I talking to, Tony is not here, not with me, he only comes out when I'm alone, and I'm not alone, looking at a shadow with no face.¬†

I can‚Äôt move. I want to but I can‚Äôt. It stares at me but I can‚Äôt move, I want to run but I can‚Äôt, I want to scream but I can‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt do anything but stare back. And it does not move, it must be scared too, but then it opens its eyes and I can see it‚Äôs face. It‚Äôs not mine. It‚Äôs an old man. That‚Äôs not me. He picks up my toys and takes them away from me. Says I need to be a man. What are you saying, I hear someone saying, but I don‚Äôt listen to anyone anymore, so I plug my ears. Then that pile of wrinkles grabs my wrist, forcing the words inside me, and I want him to stop but I can‚Äôt .¬†

I can‚Äôt remember her, can‚Äôt remember her name, but I do remember her telling me this place was haunted, I should have believed her. She told me that she talks to them quite often, and right here in this spot she saw her red ball bounce down the stairs, that there was no one else there, only a spirit, the spirit of someone who died here, a boy, like me, but not. How could he still be a little boy when he had died so long ago, I wanted to ask her. But I didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want her to tell me that he was me. She would push me down the stairs if I said that, and I would die for real, and if I didn't, then that would be awkward for me and her, because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play in this house anymore. And I liked her, even if she was a girl, I didn‚Äôt care, even if she tried to kill me, I didn‚Äôt care even if she did.

It‚Äôs pitch black in here, and I can‚Äôt see anything when I close my eyes, and the brownish light above me stains everything it touches, and it touches everything. Don‚Äôt look, I hear crying through the walls, so I don‚Äôt look. I am hiding from the yelling in the corner, but I‚Äôm not afraid, I'm never afraid, I only pretend to be afraid because that‚Äôs what I'm supposed to feel. He told me he would send me to a place where bad boys like me lived. You didn‚Äôt even cry, you didn‚Äôt even cry when they died. But that was a lie, I don‚Äôt know what, but it was a lie. But If someone told you that you would get mad and you would hit him, so that‚Äôs what I did, but I didn‚Äôt hit him with my fists but with my hammer, and he fell down the stairs with a thump thump thump as he hit the wall, when I pushed him.¬†

She pushed me out the door, outside a long time ago, I don‚Äôt know when, but a long time ago, to the great big cattle fields in front of her house. I never saw any cows there, but I believed her when she said that when it gets hot the cows come back, but at that moment the field was empty and the air was cool. And out there in the field she wants to show me something, I don‚Äôt know what, what could be in the middle of that field. Barbed wire pricks at my finger and it bleeds, I didn‚Äôt think it was actually sharp but I pretend to be a man and suck it up, putting my finger in mouth, tasting the hot fire slide down my tongue, and she couldn‚Äôt care less as she crawls underneath the fence, through a small hole, and so I follow.

I follow the ball as it fell down the stairs, and I catch it, or I try to, and it rolls on the steps. But I didn‚Äôt care about that ball anymore so I don‚Äôt look, even if it wakes her up I won‚Äôt care, I don‚Äôt try to stop it anymore, and instead I look up at the sky, but only see the ceiling, and no matter how hard I think, I could not see the sky. The sky is not narrow like this stairwell, thump thump it goes down, and down there there's more room to walk, but up here there‚Äôs not as much. Then I hear the sound of the ball rolling away on the floor, the sound that hollow balls make, that weird sound, twirling sound that comes from inside that ball. Later I will open that ball with my knife, and It will pop, and I will find nothing. This is her favorite ball, so afterwards I'll hide it someplace where no one will find it.¬†

No one will find us, she says. The cold air runs through my shirt, the wind howls, and I shutter. No one will find it, I say back. And she can tell I'm scared, but I'm not, I'm just pretending like always, but she doesn‚Äôt buy it, I can tell that by the gleam in her eyes, the gleam like the eyes of a tiger I‚Äôve seen on the television, and she laughs, or something, I can‚Äôt remember, maybe barks. And out from her winter coat pocket she pulls out a sharp knife that hurts. I‚Äôm jealous and angry, mostly angry, but not really, that she put on her favorite jacket without telling me to put on mine, and now I'm cold, but men don‚Äôt get cold, so I'm not. She says something about the knife, I‚Äôm not impressed with whatever she said.¬†

She said something to me, but I couldn‚Äôt understand it. I‚Äôm going to be honest, I zoned out, like I always do, and her lips moved but words didn‚Äôt come out, at least to me. Something was on the T.V. I couldn‚Äôt see. Bright summer light stained the glass of the old box, I could only make out two shadows. It looked like mom and dad, from where I was, and they were crying, it wanted me to see the lady crying. But I knew they were both crying as they kissed. They kissed a grownups kiss, I could tell. Rain pouring on them, they didn‚Äôt care, a dropped umbrella at their side, how romantic, I hear, they must really love each other. I play in the rain too, never like this, I wouldn‚Äôt want to. The deep puddle of water splashes at my feet, the rain keeps falling down, my foot sinks into a pothole, or just a normal hole, or into nothing, my shoe was now heavy with something.

My shoe was heavy with snow. They buried me in the frozen sand up to my head, and I still felt warm.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work out between us, she finally said, or maybe I finally said. And I don‚Äôt think it mattered who had said it, we both felt it, at least I think I did, so all that matters is that it was said between us, to us. I thought that I would get angry, that I would beg, that I would cry, but no, I must have anticipated it, for now I don‚Äôt feel anything at all, and that might be worse. I should turn off the car, I thought, so I do, and I sit there, waiting for something. We are in her driveway, and the cool nights air drifting through my window smells crisp. Crisp with the scent of cow shit, I‚Äôm not going to miss this place afterall, cow shit and all, but I'm a little sad,I never got to ride her horse, I‚Äôve always wanted to ride one, now I probably never will. The car stereo is still on. It‚Äôs quiet, at a gentle hum, as if it were whispering to me in a frequency I couldn‚Äôt understand. La-di-da-da La-di-da-da, I think it went. I hate this song. I turn off the radio. Now the only sound is from the wind pouring in. It‚Äôs cold, I shiver, even though I have a coat on. It‚Äôs all over. Then I look over and see that someone's in the passenger's seat. It‚Äôs her, she hasn‚Äôt left, I thought she would, but she hasn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs crying, I think, I don‚Äôt know why, no, I have an idea why, so I wait, wait for her to say it.

Say it, she says, tell me everything‚Äôs going to work out. The lady is crying. Say it, the crying lady whimpers, say it. The man holds the woman in his arms and he kisses her, it‚Äôs a fake kiss I can tell, the music swells, how romantic she says, and I imagine how shallow her life is and will be. Then she looks at me, with evil intentions in her eyes, I can tell, I don‚Äôt know how. Her lips smack. Hey, have you ever kissed a girl before, she asks. She looks straight into my eyes, and something was there, something strange, I‚Äôve never had anyone look at me like that.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I‚Äôm so sorry I got you involved with me, you‚Äôre so much better than me, you deserve someone better than me, you‚Äôre great, I‚Äôm just bringing you down, I need to work on myself, I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a long time, I need space to think, I need to learn to love myself, I can‚Äôt love anyone until I do that, I still want to be friends, I care about you, all I've done is care about others, I‚Äôve never tried caring about myself before. She says all that. No more words to be said. She‚Äôs done with her script, her part has been played, and that part had been played well, and when she‚Äôs done I can‚Äôt tell if any of it was an act or not. Well, like I have any right to complain, you are an awful, awful, person, is what she really said to me, she might as well have, and I would have agreed with her. There‚Äôs a monster living inside of me, I can feel it. I can feel it‚Äôs touch. Thanks for everything, I say, Thanks for all the memories, all the experiences, I‚Äôll never forget you, I say, absolving all involvement I had in this play. She smiles, she looks beautiful, I really do love her. Not a trace of her tears are left in her eyes anymore. Of course, she says. I forget the rest, they were probably lies anyway, so why bother, it‚Äôs useless, so instead I listen to the wind, It‚Äôs howling.¬†

Across the field and into the woods I hear the howling of the wild dogs, and I get scared, but not really, I‚Äôm safe, she told me she would protect me, and I believe her, the knife dazzles in her hand once again. Just a little father she says, we‚Äôre almost there, I can feel it getting closer and closer, that boy told me about this place, he said you would like it, like it a lot, especially you. And that last part really made my blood shiver, as they say, why a ghost would be talking about me, I‚Äôm not that interesting, I'm not that special in any way, I know it, I can feel that inside of me.¬†

I feel my heart break inside of me as she gets out of the car and goes inside the warmly lit house that I had never been inside. Of course I have been inside her house before, but for some reason she never lets me in her room, I don‚Äôt know why, I do now, I feel stupid not to have seen it earlier, for being so na√Øve. I can still smell the fragrance of her perfume in the car, I bet her room smells like that, but probably not, I bet when she goes inside there she‚Äôs a completely different person, not like it matters anymore, I know it‚Äôs all over. I‚Äôll never see this house again in my life. I study it‚Äôs features for the last time, then I twist the key into the ignition, the car rumbles, a false start, I can hear it whimpering, so I twist it again, this time I can feel the car shake awake. I take one last look around, but I don‚Äôt take any of it in, it doesn‚Äôt feel real for some reason, I could wake up at any moment, but that‚Äôs probably only what I want, to be asleep, I‚Äôm awake, i‚Äôm not sleeping, I‚Äôm not dead, I‚Äôm awake, I just have to keep telling myself that until I get home, I don‚Äôt want to go home, but I know I have to. If I don‚Äôt move now, I won‚Äôt move ever, ever again, I can feel it, someone is trying to tell me to go home, and I can feel my body listening to them as my hand grips the shifter, and my foot presses the brake, and my mind vanishes, and I move.¬†

I move my body up and down the stairs, or at least I try to, but after playing all day I'm tired and I don‚Äôt want to do anything anymore but sit and watch the colors move along the glass box, so I stop. Teddy, I say out loud, but he‚Äôs not here, he‚Äôs not real, no matter how much I pretend that he is. I know that but I still try because I always see little kids telling the adults about their imaginary friends, at least in the movies, about how their imaginary friend told them to do this or that, or about how their imaginary friend suddenly came to life, how I would like that, but then again something bad always happens afterwards, like it was actually a ghost, or a evil demon, or something like that. I ask Tony about it. He laughs, I think, and tells me all those things were made up by people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about, he seems kind of mad about it, I can tell. Don‚Äôt believe them, I think he says, Papa and Mama don‚Äôt love you anymore, don‚Äôt believe their lies.¬†

Don‚Äôt believe what they tell you, someone says, he says, I think, I think. And I believe him, that there was nothing wrong, I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong. Reaching down into the cooler he pulls out a tin can, no, a normal can, whatever that is, and he hands it to me. It‚Äôs cold and wet and it smells. My fingers scratch the opening trying to force it open but I can‚Äôt, he laughs, I run away with it, I know he‚Äôll try to take it back from me, I won‚Äôt let him. Then I notice my finger bleeding. The sharp tab cut me, I think, It stings, and it‚Äôs hot, I‚Äôm bleeding, I can‚Äôt believe it. Somehow I got it open, and I smell the opening, and it smells bad, but it‚Äôs not bad, I see guys doing it and they tell me it‚Äôs not bad, so I drink it.

So I drink my coffee to stay awake, it‚Äôs no longer hot, it tastes bitter on the way down, it makes me feel intoxicated. No, that‚Äôs wrong, I feel intoxicated before that, the night, the snow falling heavy on the car make me feel so. And I have to stay awake. I smell her leftover scent drifting throughout the car. I wonder how long until it disappears, how long until I forget this smell. I love you, I can hear it say to me from the back, but she‚Äôs not there, she doesn‚Äôt say things like that anymore, not for a long time now. And this snow makes me tired, like a blanket across the road, the cold from the window makes.

Makes me sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm laughing, I don‚Äôt know why, but someone is sick to their stomach. We‚Äôre almost there, she says, We‚Äôre almost there, I say, just a little longer, just a little longer. I can‚Äôt stand the cold any longer so I go to close the window, but I can‚Äôt, the cold wind flies down my shirt and I'm cold, out there, in the middle of that field, where she‚Äôs leading me by the hand, and I can feel the warmth in her palms, and I feel alive, truly alive, with her, and I want to cry but the tears freeze up before they leave my eye, and I know I'm going to die. We‚Äôre here, she stops, she says, she turns, we‚Äôre here near the entrance to the forest, and I look back and I can see her house, but it isn‚Äôt her house I see, It can‚Äôt be, but I don‚Äôt know, It must be, that towering shadow in the distance must be hers. Look, she says. There‚Äôs something on the ground, and just a few more steps will bring us to it, and we do so, creeping forward step by step, my feet sinking into the dirt of the forest, and I see it. It was a bone, bone of something I don‚Äôt know, a cow, she says, I told you there were cows here you didn‚Äôt believe me. I believed you, I said, but that's not a cow, that‚Äôs a bone, a single round bone. I see he raise her hand preparing to hit me, but I don‚Äôt flinch, I expect it to hurt, and her hand punches my shoulder, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt, I can‚Äôt feel anything in this cold. Where do you think that came from Idiot, she says. A cow, I say. It looks like it‚Äôs the hip bone, I can tell, and I see some flesh still fresh on it, and I look around the woods, trying to see if there are any wolves nearby, maybe hiding behind the trees, there are none. And I look back towards the bone. Somehow I didn‚Äôt notice it, somehow I didn‚Äôt notice there was something else near it. It was a foot, the foot of a cow, and I look up expecting there to be one in front of me, but there isn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs only a missing foot. I call for the girl but I can‚Äôt, I‚Äôve forgotten her name, I‚Äôve forgotten how to talk, I look behind me to where she is, where is she, she‚Äôs not there anymore, I look around and I‚Äôm all alone. I see it, I don‚Äôt know what it is, something coming towards me.

Something screams. Thump Thump Thump, something in the road. The car is sliding. My brakes don‚Äôt work. I keep sliding, into the ditch, the snow compacts around me. Branches knock against me. The windshield cracks. The snow catches me. I stop. I hear something make a piercing cry, and then it‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm awake.¬†

The ditch had turned into a decent. The car had slipped down the hill and into the field. The front of it was buried in sand. Not a scratch is on me, no, I'm bleeding. I go to open the door, but it catches dirt, and I can‚Äôt squeeze out. Salt drips in through the crack, so I close it, but it won‚Äôt close, it‚Äôs filling with water, or something like that. It doesn‚Äôt matter what, it‚Äôs all the same. It‚Äôs dark, there is no sign of the light, I turn the keys in the ignition and it does nothing, but the lights do come back momentarily, just momentarily, and in that brownish light I see nothing.¬†

And the moon is not out tonight, not a trace of it, I can tell, here at the bottom of this well, I might as well be, I might as well not have eyes, I might as well be asleep, here in this darkness, in this cold, the heat dispersing, I know it, this time I can feel it, I can feel it leaving me, I can feel it in the backseat, blood pouring from its broken head, judging me, stealing my breath, stealing that scent, and outside I can hear the wolves feeding, I can hear the howling, I can hear the front door open, and I hear them calling to me, We‚Äôre home, and as I run down the stairs I step on something red, and I fly",1,1752439093.0,u_Vivid_Engineer_5425,0,1.0,False

1lz362k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lz362k/should_you_try_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_coffee/,Should You Try the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker Review for Compact Brewing?,"The **Nespresso ENV92BCA Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker and Espresso Machine, Licorice Black** caught my eye as a compact yet stylish addition to my morning routine. I've been using it daily for the past three weeks, testing every feature, and trying to figure out if it really lives up to its hype. While I ended up satisfied overall, there are a few nuances that stood out (both good and bad), which I'll walk you through here.

**Build and Design Appeal**  
This coffee maker doesn‚Äôt just deliver coffee; it‚Äôs also something of a statement piece. Its glossy licorice black finish adds a sleek touch to my kitchen counter, and its compact size is perfect for smaller spaces. Measuring just 14 inches by 8.6 inches by 10.4 inches, it fits on a side counter without being an attention hog. The design also pairs beautifully with contemporary kitchens or more minimalist set-ups. However, I did notice the plastic exterior, although high-quality, can attract smudges easily. Keep a microfiber cloth handy because, if you‚Äôre like me, any hint of fingerprints might drive you nuts.

**Ease of Use**  
What really stood out to me is the simplicity of this machine. The one-touch brewing function is a game changer during hectic mornings. Paired with the fully automatic operation mode, all you need to do is pop in a Vertuo capsule and hit the button. No confusing dials or settings here‚Äîit‚Äôs incredibly intuitive. Even my less coffee-savvy partner managed to master it on the first try. That said, the unit lacks adjustable brewing temperature settings, which might frustrate coffee enthusiasts seeking a more tailored experience.

[Check Nespresso ENV92BCA price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c3p9p7b3/)

**Functionality and Performance**  
This machine isn‚Äôt just about appearances. It delivers six different coffee sizes‚ÄîRistretto, Espresso, Double Espresso, Gran Lungo, Mug/Coffee, and Alto‚Äîalongside a Cold Brew style coffee functionality. I particularly loved switching between these for different moods (and caffeine tolerances). The machine‚Äôs results are consistent, producing a rich crema every time, especially for espresso shots. And if you‚Äôre someone like me who occasionally drinks cold coffee, the Cold Brew feature is a very welcome bonus. However, households with more general coffee consumption preferences might find the reliance on Nespresso capsules inconvenient or even restrictive.

**Upsides**  
- Compact and lightweight, ideal for small counters or tight spaces.  
- One-touch brewing makes operation effortless, even for beginners.  
- Six coffee size options tailored for varying moods and occasions.  
- Consistently delivers high-quality coffee with creamy, smooth crema.  
- Sleek licorice black finish adds an elegant touch to most kitchen setups.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Requires frequent descaling if used daily, which might feel tedious.  
- Limited to Nespresso‚Äôs capsule system, reducing broader compatibility for users.  
- No adjustable temperature settings for customizable coffee brewing.  

**Versatility Meets Technology**  
What‚Äôs surprising for such a small unit is the inclusion of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities. This isn‚Äôt just a gimmick‚Äîit‚Äôs practical. Using the app, firmware updates come automatically to enhance brewing performance. The app also lets you monitor brewing stats and reminds you when it‚Äôs time to reorder capsules. While I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd use this feature at first, it‚Äôs grown on me. On the downside, the Bluetooth pairing set-up had me scratching my head for a while‚Äîan easier walkthrough video could be helpful.  

**Energy Use and Maintenance**  
Noise-wise, this little machine is about average. It won‚Äôt wake your entire house but isn‚Äôt exactly whisper quiet either during operation. It operates at 120 volts and offers impressive energy efficiency, auto-shutting down after nine minutes of inactivity. Cleaning is relatively simple, thanks to the capsule collection bin holding several used pods, but liquids from used capsules occasionally drip into the tray if you don‚Äôt empty it often enough.

**Alternative Products**  
While the Vertuo Pop+ stands out as an all-rounder, I‚Äôve used other single-serve brewers, such as the Keurig K-Express and Breville Bambino Plus. Compared to the Keurig, Nespresso offers a more premium coffee experience with a richer crema, though Keurig pods are cheaper and more widely available. The Breville Bambino Plus, on the other hand, caters to more serious coffee enthusiasts with manual espresso-making options but lacks the Pod simplicity and compact design of this unit. If ease of use and space-saving are priorities, Nespresso takes the lead.

**Smart Spending**  
You‚Äôre not just getting a coffee maker with this machine; you‚Äôre paying for an integrated coffee system experience. Given its functionality, built-in technologies, and reliable brewing results, it offers decent cost efficiency. It particularly shines if you value ease of use premium-grade single-serve coffee at home. What you may need to consider, though, is the ongoing cost of capsules, which could add up quickly depending on how much coffee you consume.

Hello, sa mga tulad ko pong nag move-out nang kulang sa budget, ano po magandang bilhin muna? I plan to buy quality products na din for the long run. Parecommend din naman po ng affordable and mid-range option if meron po kayong maisip.

**1.  Mattress - Mandaue Foam**

**2. E-fan (Stand fan or Tower fan)**

>Not sure kung bibili na ko neto or next time na. May clip fan kasi ako na ginagamit at di naman masyadong mainit dahil sa ulan. Gusto ko tower fan kasi space saving kaso sabi ng workmates ko malaki daw konsumo sa kuryente?

**3. Cabinet**

>Torn between drawer cabinet or wood cabinet. Gusto ko kasi siyang gawing room divider na din between my bed tsaka sa living area since studio lang apt ko. I might have to spend 4k-10k on a wood cabinet while yung drawer cabinet, 1k lang malaki na at quality. 

**4. Bed frame (metal or wood) or Induction Cooker with pots and pans.**

>Not sure kung ano uunahin sa dalawa. Tumaba ako recently so back to OMAD po ako in which sa work po ako kumakain kasi may free meal. Sa weekend lang ako kakain sa apt at may carinderia naman sa malapit.

>Gusto ko ng bed frame kasi para madali makatayo kasi pang 50 yrs old na po likod ko and di ako comfy na sa sahig yung mattress in case may gumapang na kung ano.

**5. Washing Machine or Refrigerator**

>On the other hand, malaki tipid ng washing machine kasi around 200-400 gastos ko sa laundry every 2 weeks.

I have not been able to finish a painting in three months now. I‚Äôve started and stopped, and next to my stool on the ground of my studio is a pile of almost blank frames, half full of thoughtless, effortless blobs and strokes of meaningless color

As I sit, listening to my music, Christine uses her key and comes into the apartment, ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù me with the same breakfast sandwich and black coffee that she drops off every Wednesday morning. They‚Äôre ‚ÄúTo get the juices flowing,"" she says. I don‚Äôt care enough to tell her that whatever creative juices I had have spilled, pooled, and dissolved. I have nothing to show her except a fresh, empty canvas on my easel, crusted dry brushes, and an array of paints on which I spent my last paycheck. I sit like that all day, trying painfully to think of something, and when that doesn't work, I scroll for hours, willing the internet to show me something that might spark even the tiniest bit of inspiration. But nothing does, and I waste the day and night scrolling, staring, brooding, eating little, and drinking less, leaving my studio well into the next morning.

The winter air feels good as I walk onto the fire escape for a smoke break. Pink dawn cracks through the black sky to end twenty-four hours with no progress to show for it. When I am finished, I stub my cigarette out on the railing and stumble to my bed, and after much thrashing and pillow fluffing, I fall into the sleep you can only have after being up for a full twenty four hours. 

My dreams are fragmented and barely coherent, the way dreams are, most of them boring. I stumble through white hallways, one white room after another, as if the wallpaper and tiles were bleached and never touched again. The lamps and chairs are white, and even the world beyond the pale windows is white. I reach a door at the end of a colorless hallway, grab the blank knob, and snap awake. 

All I can see is white.

And then I roll over, and pull the bedsheet down from my eyes, looking out the window at the happy blue sea of the sky, fat chalky clouds voyaging across its waves. After breakfast, Christine comes by again and asks to look at my painting. She doesn‚Äôt usually come two days in a row. She hasn‚Äôt spent the night in weeks, and neither of us have had the money to go out to dinner. She must be worried. I tell her I'd rather keep it a surprise until it's done, and we chat about how her mom‚Äôs hip is doing and the weather and other things I don't care about. The whole time she talks, I think about how if I could just see my canvas, I would be able to finally see what I need to do. Eventually, she takes the hint and stops mid-sentence halfway through a story about her dad's cholesterol or about how she almost got into an accident last week or something else you couldn‚Äôt convince anyone on earth to care about. When she finally does leave, I put on my smock and grab my supplies. 

I once again sit silently, unmoving, in front of my blank canvas. I was wrong, and have been sitting here for an hour with nothing to show. I pick up my brush and dip it in a blob of yellow-orange paint that has mostly dried out. I study the canvas and put the brush back down, washing off the paint as I do. 

I am only aware I have fallen asleep when I realize I am dreaming again. I try my best, but I cannot wake up and am once again in an all-white room. It is different from any of the rooms the last time. This one is much tighter, and the ceiling, which holds a motionless, completely bland fan in its center, is only a few inches from my head. I walk across this barren room to the door and nearly trip on a rug that was almost impossible to determine from the snow-white floor it lays on. On the other side is another hallway with windows that stretch from ceiling to floor, nothing but an unmoving white abyss beyond them. At the end of the hallway is yet another door, and behind this one lies a room so white I almost didn't recognize that it was identical to my studio, except of course bleach white. 

On my stool, looking at the blank canvas in my blank room is an entirely blank man, his pale white back to me.

I wake up, not to the white of my bed sheet but to the white of my canvas. I have fallen asleep in my chair, my back curled and chest slumped into my lap. My back hurts. My canvas looks down on me, unmoving, imposing, empty. My neck is stiff, and my arms are tired, but a wave of hunger hits me so painfully that I crawl to the kitchen instead of returning to my bed. As I cook, I turn on the weather and listen to a man who is more excited about an upcoming snowstorm than a man his age should be. I watch as he trips over his words in anticipation while the ice-blue snowflake graphics float behind him on a green screen. It has been a while since we got a good coating of snow in the city. When it snows, the whole city goes to sleep. The endless movement slows for a while, everyone tucked into a cold and cozy white blanket. I always liked snow.

I can barely eat. The fat yellow pupil of a cooked egg stares back up at me, making me queasy. The bacon it took me so long to prepare looks limp and slimy, and the longer I study, the more apparent it is that I burnt it, and I choke down what little I can and throw the rest away. I don‚Äôt want to stay in my house or think about my nightmare, so I bundle up and go out into the slowly freezing world for a walk. 

I almost turn right around and go back inside the second I step out. The snow has begun to fall, slow, but determined, and it is bitterly cold. It claws through all three layers I have on and chills the marrow in my bones, but I need to clear my head. The streets are empty, with no cars drifting through the road and no one bold enough to brave the elements to walk their dogs or run errands. I take advantage of this emptiness and approach the park in the city's center. The snow is falling harder now, sticking aggressively to the branches and beginning to coat the undisturbed roads. The world is slowly being painted over white. I am cold, and I second guess how smart it was to leave just as the storm began in earnest. But I am here and will not waste this opportunity to enjoy the park free of the rest of the annoying world. The pale green trees bend their branches under the weight of the snow and nearly pat my head as I stroll through the path. Nothing is moving besides the steady fall of snow, and there is no sound but my feet crunching. It is calm, and it is quiet, and it is cold. I pass a frozen pond that no one has yet thought of ice skating on and continue into a woodier, even more secluded area. 

I turn a corner into a clearing and see a blank man sitting on a rock. His back is to me, and when I approach, he stands, sidesteps the rock he sat on, still backwards, and takes a step towards me. I don‚Äôt move. The snow falls, the rich green grass dissolving under layers and layers of cruel white I take a step back, confused, but not scared. The blank man copies me, his footstep softer than mine, a faint crunch crunch as he moves. I step backwards again, and so does he. I turn and run. The snow is falling hard now, uncaring, and a tree branch that was high and dry a moment ago is drooping, sagging level to my face. I ran straight into it and skidded, dropping to the ground. I wipe the snow from my face and stare back towards the man. 

A fat white blob sits unsteadily on a rock, silent and unmoving. Then a group of kids crawl out from behind their snowman and stare at me confused, giggling. Flakes collect on their fuzzy beanies as one bends to brush through the snow. She finally finds something, pulls out a stiff, pale, orange carrot, and slams it into the unfeeling face of their creation. I leave the artists to their work. More people are out playing in the snow, a firm inch or two already coating the ground, with no sign of stopping soon. Kids build snow forts and throw snowballs, and I watch a woman walk a toddler down their front steps. He sticks his tongue out of his fat little face, catches a flake, and stumbles, landing butt-first in the snow. His mom laughs with him as he flails around, watching him make his first snow angel. 

I go home and watch the snow fall while wrapped in a thick blanket. Everyone goes back inside, the coldness and the wetness and the allure of warmth too strong to ignore anymore. White overtakes everything again. I do not fall asleep for hours when I finally return to bed. I toss, turn, wait, and try to relax, but I cannot stop thinking about the snow, white rooms, and canvas. When I fall asleep, I am again in the hallway full of windows. There is movement beside me for the first time in any of these dreams. Outside the windows, pure white flecks pass through a pure white haze and land on pure white ground. 

Behind me, the blank door to my studio opens. The man, who is nothing but white, has his hand on the knob and is looking at me. He has eyes now, pale orbs that  He lifts a hand that drips like it‚Äôs melting, leaking fat, thick globs of white and beckons me. 

I can do nothing but follow. 

We walk together into the studio, and he pats the seat of my stool, telling me to sit. He leaves sticky pale handprints where he touches it, and I sit. He walks behind my canvas, which matches the rest of this room, empty and colorless, and rips it in half. He tears at the frame until it is nothing but paper, wood, and staples crumpled together in a pile at our feet. He simply kneels, picks up a piece, a beam of wood with the paper still stapled to it and puts it in his mouth. He didn‚Äôt have a mouth before. I don't think he did. I'm not sure. I Hear the wood snap and pop in his mouth as he grinds the staples between his teeth. There is paper sticking out of his chapped, white lips, and as he swallows the wood, he pulls in the paper with a white tongue that seems to stretch endlessly back into a deep, pale throat. I see the wood bulge against his neck as it struggles down. I see the prick of the staple point from inside his skin as it falls. 

He looks up and hands a piece to me. 

I sit there and stare at him. I turn the frame over in my hands, studying the wood. It is sharp and splintered where he broke it, and he waits and eats another piece, expecting me to follow suit.  

I only put it in my mouth because I am sure I‚Äôm dreaming. He smiles, exposing the bits of paper and wood wedged between the gaps in his teeth, and that pale tongue again emerges and licks those same chapped lips as I begin to chew, grinding the frail wood the best I can, the paper going down first, and quickly. After a moment, the wood becomes soft enough for me to mash it and get it all down. My throat is filled with a million splinters as it travels down to my stomach, and the wood does not stay down for long. As soon as it is swallowed, my stomach begins to reject it. I fall to my knees and retch up the wood and paper, a pulpy mess of curdled liquid white erupting, the thing behind me watching thoughtfully. It shambles back in front of me and drops to his hands and knees, paralleling me. It looks into my eyes, never blinking, never closing, as a river of color rushes out of its gaping mouth. Reds, greens, blues, purples, and yellows slam out of its maw, collecting on the floor in a chunky, runny mess. Orange, pink, and violet tears leak from his eyes and bubble as his stomach bulges and pushes more and more out. It goes on for minutes, spreading towards me and coating my hands in its slick, viscous contents, meeting, mixing with, then overtaking my pale white puke. When it is done, the thing now half white half everything else lays face down in his bile and rolls over. Then rolls over again and again, soaking his arms, legs, and bare scalp with what he has just released. He collects it in his hands to slurp it back down. Flakes of solid color dribble out of his mouth and down his arms, and he just as quickly sucks them back into himself. He cackles as I try to stumble to my feet and begin to crawl away, the only sound he has released this entire time. He moves towards me with hands that drop clotted lumps of muddied colors. His fingers touch my mouth, and as they begin to break through my tightened lips, fingertips dripping with a mixture that fills my mouth until I begin to choke, I finally wake up.     

My bedroom is cold, and outside, the snow has stopped. I walk to the fire escape in a daze, and my hands shake as I light a cigarette. The storm has done its job, and the pale black arms of street lights illuminate nothing but a sheet of pure white. I breathe deeply, forget my dream, and watch the street as a plow truck hauls through, throwing mountains of snow on the sidewalk. 

The thing from my dreams is lying in one of the piles the plow has formed. 

It languishes there, stretching and convulsing, staring straight into my window. As it thrashes, the snow around it turns into a collage of light blues, neon greens, reds, and oranges that slowly mix into an ugly brown. Its blank eyes look everywhere, and nowhere and straight into my apartment window, and as they lock with mine, it smiles. His plump, purple-yellow gums are filled with the most brilliant white teeth I‚Äôve ever seen. He moves his arms up and down and back again, kicking his feet to the left and right while that smile spreads across his face. As he gnashes his teeth, he bites at the air. He rolls forward and off the mound to display his work to me. In the place where he laid sits the colorful impression of a snow angel; underneath it, the snow is pitch black. 

I am not dreaming. 

In the last week, I have accumulated twenty-three missed calls, fourteen voicemails, and two hundred and seven missed messages. I know most of them are from Christine because I keep seeing her photo as the phone lights up, but I cannot answer. She can live with another missed dinner date, and there is no use in answering her anyway. I barely move, I can barely think, I barely exist for hours at a time, then snap back as I feel myself drifting off. I cannot sleep. I refuse to. I sit alone in my room, not the studio, not my bed, but on the floor. The two meals I‚Äôve had in the last three days do not give me enough energy to stay vigilant, and I do not have the strength to make another dazed trip into the kitchen for granola bars and water. I have not slept even one minute since I saw that thing. I do not ever want to see it again. 

So I sit on my floor, stare at the wall, and try to think of nothing, but can only think of that thing. I still feel like it can see me, even as I look and see nothing but the plain white wall. I am so hungry. I am so tired. My eyes are so heavy. Closing them for just a moment will be ok.

I open my eyes to merciful color. 

I am in a field of beautiful green grass. In the distance, there is a small stream that bubbles, sings, and moves, a gorgeous blue-green. The sky above me is cloudless and a pretty pinkish purple. I lay down and brush my fingers through the soft blades of pale, verdant grass, pushing them down into the brown-gray mud below. Beautiful yellow flowers blossom all around me, and disgusting, slimy, and wonderful red and orange bugs parade in the dirt all around me. I lay down in the weeds, bask in the warm summer air, slip a strand of grass between my teeth, and chew hungrily on the sweet strip. 

As I stare into the sky, a fat snowflake lands on the edge of my nose and melts against my skin. The grass grows pale under my fingers, and the ground hardens and cracks under my feet. The flowers freeze up and wither and fade and the bugs stop their endless squirming and stiffen and pop. The river in the distance is quieted and becomes a frail frozen white, and the sky is circled and devoured by unfeeling and uncolorful clouds. Drops of ice begin to rain from above me, and the snow begins to coat everything I see. As the stiffened corpse of the world is again covered by a mortician's sheet of white, I hear a burst of wheezing laughter grow louder in my ears until it breaks me from my dream.   

I am alone in my studio. I am in my smock, and my canvas is before me. It is blank and stiff. The night sky is black and unfeeling from beyond my window. The faint stars peek in and see me alone, with my brushes and paints laid out, just as I assemble them, red to violet and everything in between. But I didn‚Äôt do this. I don‚Äôt think so. I am so confused, and hungry. And I am so, so tired. My eyelids sink again, and I once more fall asleep in my chair. 

Blank eyes meet mine as I awake from a peaceful, dreamless sleep. The thing is back. He stands before the open window, breaking daylight illuminating the drying paint that still flakes from his emaciated body in brittle clumps. It still drips from his mouth, where his colorful spew has yet to dry. Minutes pass, and we just stare at each other. He smiles, gurgles and a bubble of puke pops out of his mouth and sprays my face with yellow and red dots. My stomach grumbles, and my eyelids grow heavy again. The colorful thing with a smile that goes on forever and dead eyes that burn with neon fire lurches forward to pick up a jar of my bright orange paint. He dips his fingers into the still, thick fluid and pulls them out the blazing color of flame. Hands strong as iron grab my face, and nails that are cracked and blistered with blues and reds dig into my cheeks as he spreads my lips apart. I fight to keep them closed, I try to scratch his face and pull away, but he feels nothing. My nails cannot pierce his goopy, gushing skin, and I cannot break from his grip. He pushes his fingers deep into my mouth and fans them out until my tongue is coated with a layer of orange scum. As he pulls his hand out of my mouth, he dips it again into a mason jar of purple and pulls out a handful of syrupy paint. He forces his coated hand deep into the back of my throat and opens his palm. I feel the ropey, thick paint slide down and into my body as it cools my throat and floats to my stomach. A fat burp crawls from my lips as the paint is swallowed, and my stomach screams in delight. For a second, I am not so hungry anymore. Then he pulls my head back and reaches for the largest jar, a stocky container of the brightest red money can buy. I can do nothing but close my eyes and wait. The cold, wet paint splashes onto my open lips and spills out onto my chin and up my nose. It flows in rushing torrents down my throat, spills onto my pants, and mixes through my hair. It fills my stomach and I can feel as it covers my intestines in a fresh coat of ruby. He smashes a jar between the wall and his hand and shards of glass embed themselves into his palm, dripping dark red blood onto the rug that is already splattered with so many colors. He drips his thin wet fluids into my mouth, and they cascade down into my gut, mixing with the paint that is beginning to turn and revolt. As he pours another jar of sweet sickly green into my mouth, the previous two jars‚Äô contents explode back to the surface in a fountain of sickly browned colors. The thing ignores this and still forces my head back as I gasp, jerk, choke, and erupt with the mixture he has poured into me, a mixture that lands right back on top of me in chunky, sticky globs of colorful vomit, and finds its way right back down to my stomach as he pours another jar in. I cannot breathe, and I cannot stop sucking at the air and gagging as the paint spills out of my full mouth, onto my chest, between my fingers, and under my clothes. I gulp it down as more is piled, dripped, and forced into my mouth. My eyes are so heavy, and I am so tired, but I am not hungry anymore. Not at all. The melting colorful man steps back, admiring his work, smiling and licking his lips. He runs to the wall and mashes his face into it, rubbing his wet cheeks into the plaster, leaving a leering imprint. The clotted, dripping paint covers my face and mixes into my eyes. He keeps thrashing from wall to wall, dancing, colliding his painted image into the studio all around me. I see that in front of me, the mess of color and puke has not reached my canvas mere feet away from me. It is still empty and white. A dry, heaving chuckle bubbles past the paint and out of my throat, and I fall asleep laughing.  

I do not remember much of what happened the days after they found me. A neighbor had grown concerned at the heavy pile of mail collecting on my welcome mat, and called for a welfare check. When I didn‚Äôt answer, and my door was found to be unlocked, the police sent to conduct it walked right in and found me unconscious in my studio, covered in a layer of paint an inch thick. Christine says she still isn't comfortable talking about it yet, but the doctors were, with the little that they knew. They told me that after my stomach was pumped, the room it was done in had to be bleached and repainted. Twice. 

I tried explaining that there was someone else there but it was no use. It looked insane. I looked insane. I felt insane. So they sent me here. 

Christine comes in to check on me, as she has begun to do less and less frequently. I remember seeing her while I was recovering, how the harsh fluorescent lighting that would make anyone else look washed out and wretched combed around her fiery golden hair as if it was a halo. She still supports my painting even after all that‚Äôs happened, and just the other day brought me new supplies and an old canvas. She says that the doctors and her think this could be a healthy outlet for me.

It is because of her that I sit here, staring at my almost finished painting, thinking it still needs something. A fantastic mess of color stares back at me, an army of red zigzags colliding with blue dots and orange stripes that stitch together greens and browns, blacks and violets, any and all colors I could make. It is beautiful, and yet I'm sure I'm missing something.

A nurse comes in and tells me the lights are out in fifteen minutes and to start cleaning up. I ask her what she thinks, and she grunts, gives it a glance and claims that it‚Äôs just perfect the way it is. She tells me to put my supplies away and one her way out glances at my jars to see if there‚Äôs more paint gone than there should be.

When I no longer hear her footsteps, I pick up the brush. There is a fat bulb of pink sliding off its edge, and I swiftly lick it off. I move it back and forth in my mouth, until I can feel it coat my teeth and gums, and I swallow the rest. I study my work again, and dab the clean brush in a jar of bright yellow. I add a dash right in the middle, covering up an almost unnoticeable hint of white, and step back to examine my painting. 

That‚Äôs just what it needed. Now it‚Äôs finished.

Single father 6 yr old boy, ended a LTR last yr and feel like it's time to dabble in the market again...

I have almost no online dating experience, probably spent 2 weeks on the app's last time before I ended up in a relationship.

Profiles here: https://imgur.com/a/ci1YkZ9

I came up with this job application gambit which I thought was fun, but bumble removed it for spam... so I had to make a normal profile here.

I figured this was a good opportunity to get some opinions on which path is better, A/B test etc.

One thing I'm considering is replacing the about me in the job posting with my bio from bumble, sounds a bit more direct/normal?

In my last relationship I felt like I wasn't able to be myself, my partner kept complaining and trying to change me, so this time I'm going to embrace myself.

The giant picture at the bottom is just for reading clarity, it's not on bumble.

Other things I'm debating.
Is the trader meme too much?  I thought it was hilarious but probably doesn't make sense for people not on /r/wallstreetbets. I figured it was fine since I am calling myself one.

I use to rock climb casually and have a SUP, but they aren't passions and I have no pictures, should I mention them somehow?

I have more controversial opinions like, coffee and pastry for $14 are not for me, or $200 dinners are meh.  But I swear 95% of profiles are dogs, travel, foodie, cafes.  

Being a single dad I already feel like my dating pool is significantly smaller, and I'm trying to balance embracing myself and scaring litterly everyone away.

1lz2uyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sunnyvale/comments/1lz2uyo/kurated_kitchens_need_it_or_keep_it/,Kurated Kitchens - Need It or Keep It?,"Welcome to the first installment of the brand new post series Need It or Keep It, where you the readers and posters of r/Sunnyvale discuss and share opinions on whether a given Sunnyvale business or fixture deserves to stick around (Need It) or should go (Keep It).

Today's topic is [Kurated Kitchens](https://kuratedkitchens.com/), the new shared kitchen space/food hall on the corner of Maude and Borregas.

My Preliminary Thoughts:

# NEED IT

* **Revival State Burgers:** The old MTV Buffalo menu is back, BAY-BEE!
* **Srasa:** Again, we are so fucking back bros.
* **An Alternative to the Murphy Ave Strip:** A nice middle ground between the full sit-down spots on Murphy and the more to-go type spots elsewhere downtown.

# KEEP IT

* **Generic Gentrification Grey:** Uninspired aesthetics and looks out of place for its location and opening a business like that there seems almost like a big deliberate tech yuppie middle finger to that area of Sunnyvale. I guess they couldn't afford a spot in the new Cityline development.
* **Poor Website Design:** Listed hours say they're closed weekends but people are saying they actually aren't apparently, online menu on their website doesn't have prices listed unless you order online which seems like an intentionally deceptive way to hide markups for takeout orders and hide the cost until you're already there and can't compare against other similar options in the area. 
* **Odd Hours:** Why dafuq are they not open at all on weekends?!?! Seems like a major missed opportunity for business given that area of Sunnyvale is typically much busier on weekends now that there's not as many in-office workers anymore.
* **808 Drip:** Do we REALLY need another overpriced coffee spot around here? Also kind of a weird naming choice considering this isn't Hawaii (All of Hawaii has the 808 phone area code, every other local business in HI has 808 in its name).
* **Hatched:** Same as above, do we REALLY need another overpriced avocado toast brunch spot around here?

# My Final Verdict:

**A Weak ""Need It""** \- Some of their current food offerings seem redundant and unnecessary for the area, they have somewhat odd/inconvenient hours and location but have the potential to do very well and be a credit to the area once they fill out all the food spaces and find their niche.",0,1752438231.0,Sunnyvale,16,0.38,False

Basically, I‚Äôm looking to throw a REALLY FUN baking-inspired (really cookie inspired) bash for my bakery‚Äôs one year anniversary. I‚Äôm calling it Cookie Fest and it‚Äôs going to be a Sat & Sun. I have some simple ideas that I‚Äôm working on fleshing out, but I was wondering if you guys could give me any ideas of what you‚Äôd like to see at an event on that title! 

My thoughts so far: 
- coffee tasting (we held one last year and it was a huge hit)

- cookie tasting (like cookie flights maybe?)

- ‚Äúname our next cookie‚Äù challenge

- recommend our next 3 recipes we try kind of thing

- cookie printing demo! we have an edible ink printer that prints right onto cookies so something where they can submit their fav selfies and come in to get it printed on a cookie‚Äî thinking maybe the first dozen who submit it online and register get it for free, then the first 10 who come in also get it for free but then it‚Äôs open for $5-8/cookie or something to the public for that hour or 2 hour period 

- royal icing making demo

- cookie painting demo

- how to monetize your bakery idea mini 101 like a 15-30 minute talk

- I reached out to a friend who makes macarons to see if she‚Äôd do a macaron demo

- I‚Äôd like to have the entire weekend long kids can come and draw a picture of their favorite cookie or something and then they get it printed on a cookie and maybe people on fb vote for their  favorite and we print it on cookies in the bakery all month long, with parental permission of course (this I‚Äôve actually been wanting to start anyway, I just think this weekend would be a fun one to kick it off with, maybe a % of sales of that cookie get donated to a local kids fund)

**Peter Ellingsworth.**

My name is Peter Ellingsworth, and this is a detailed account of what happened to me and my friends.

All my life, I‚Äôve been an adrenaline junkie‚Äîand so have John, Patricia, and Andrew. I‚Äôve known them since middle school. We‚Äôve done everything you could imagine together: explored abandoned buildings, jumped from rooftop to rooftop, wandered deep into forests, hunted for ghosts and demons‚Äîanything that gave us a high. But lately, everything else began to feel repetitive. and it started to lose its enjoyment.

Until one party came to save the day.

The four of us lived in the same neighborhood, and this party was just a few blocks away. It was hosted by a guy named Kirk‚Äîhe was known for throwing massive ragers. Nothing particularly wild happened at the party itself, but something important *did*.

Kirk came up to us, clearly a little drunk. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall‚Äôve done everything, right? Like, you‚Äôve jumped off buildings‚Äîskyscrapers‚Äîdone all kinds of crazy stuff?‚Äù

I smirked at his obsession with heights. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done a lot.‚Äù

He leaned in, slurring slightly. ‚ÄúHave you guys ever thought about going underground? Like caves‚Äîunderwater ones, even. I saw this video once‚Ä¶ people squeezing through these tight-tight spaces. Seems like something y‚Äôall would be into.‚Äù

I paused. It wasn‚Äôt a bad idea. It actually *did* sound like something we‚Äôd try.

John spoke up before I could. ‚ÄúYou know, that might be kinda cool.‚Äù

And just like that, we were sold. A new thrill.

After doing the same things five, six times over, even jumping off buildings starts to feel routine. But caves? Tight, cold, silent places where the only light is strapped to your head? That‚Äôs something new. Something raw.

Something‚Ä¶ terrifying.

It took us an agonizingly long time to get ready.

Sure, we‚Äôre adrenaline junkies‚Äîbut we‚Äôre not trying to die. The best way to enjoy a *long* adrenaline rush is to live a long life.

So, we did our homework. We researched every angle: what gear to bring, how to handle cave-ins, hypothermia, water pressure, oxygen loss‚Äîyou name it. We consulted professionals, watched documentaries, read horror stories from cave forums, even mapped out the entire area.

Eventually, we found a guy willing to go with us. A real pro‚Äîan actual cave diver‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs what they're called. His name was Ted. And he agreed to tag along, saying he‚Äôd help if anything went wrong. Honestly, having him there made the whole thing feel more real‚Ä¶ and a little safer.¬†

Saturday finally came, and we all met at the cave. The group was there‚Äîexcept Ted.

After about five minutes of waiting, Patricia let out a groan of disgust. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we just start without him?‚Äù

She had never liked the idea of bringing a professional along. Said it ruined the life-or-death thrill of it all.

Andrew immediately pushed back. ‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôd be here in fifteen minutes. It‚Äôs only been five.‚Äù

As the two started to argue, our phones buzzed. A text popped up in the group chat we‚Äôd been using to plan everything:

**Ted:** *Hey, something came up. I won‚Äôt be able to go underground with you guys. If you‚Äôd like to reschedule, I‚Äôm completely open to do so‚Äîand I won‚Äôt charge you for this.*

*Andrew read the text and slumped, staring down at his feet.*

*Patricia immediately pointed at him. ‚ÄúHa!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what, we‚Äôre doing this next Saturday now?‚Äù Andrew asked, glancing at the rest of us.*

*John stayed quiet, as usual. He was the mediator of the group‚Äîthe calm one who kept us from tearing each other apart. But the moment he hesitated, Patricia and I both turned on him. I couldn‚Äôt help myself‚ÄîI shouted.*

*‚ÄúNo! We waited all week for this. We prepared, we researched, we bought the gear. I‚Äôm not giving up now.‚Äù*

*John raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúAre you suggesting we just‚Ä¶ go in? Without Ted?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhat else does it sound like I‚Äôm suggesting?‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve prepared for this.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYeah, but‚Äî‚Äù*

*I cut him off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going in. I already know Patricia‚Äôs coming. John, you‚Äôre on the fence. Andrew... you can come if you want. But you‚Äôre not going to stop me.‚Äù*

*Patricia smirked and strolled toward the cave entrance like it was calling her name. John looked torn‚Äîexcited, anxious‚Äîbut then determination settled on his face. He followed.*

*Andrew looked around, clearly weighing his options. But when he saw that none of us were backing down, he finally sighed and stepped toward the cave with the rest of us.*

*I glanced at each of them, then gave a slow, satisfied nod.*

*A new journey awaits.*

*I stepped into the cave.*

Chapter 2

We stepped into the cave, turned on our headlamps, and began looking around. Fifteen minutes in, and so far, it had been easy‚Äîno tight squeezes, no weird terrain. Still, walking through what felt like a stone maze, surrounded by nothing but rock and shadow, steadily descending deeper into the earth‚Ä¶ that was enough to get our hearts pounding.

And if you looked at the group, you‚Äôd see it wasn‚Äôt just me. That creeping, electric buzz of adrenaline had hit all of us. So yeah‚Äîoff to a successful start.

This cave had been visited a few times before, but one of the main reasons we picked it was because three people had gone missing in it.

Now, I bet you‚Äôre wondering: *Why on Earth would we do this?* I don‚Äôt know. You figure it out.

As we kept going, we used glow-in-the-dark spray paint‚Äîthis bright, neon-green stuff that glows faintly once on the walls. It made a perfect trail to mark our way. Andrew voiced concern about it being graffiti, but John was more worried about something else: being able to get in *and* get out alive.

We kept walking for what must‚Äôve been another hour before stopping to rest. We clicked on a couple of lanterns and set up what looked like a comically stereotypical picnic. Sandwiches came out of backpacks like this was a family hike and not the start of a horror movie.

Then Patricia wandered off.

John immediately looked at me. ‚ÄúYou gonna go get your girlfriend?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúA partner in crime and a girlfriend are two *very* different things.‚Äù

‚ÄúTomato, apricot‚Äîgo get her.‚Äù

I let out a long, dramatic sigh and glanced at Andrew, hoping I could silently nominate him. But his expression was pure panic. Poor guy looked like he‚Äôd seen a ghost already.

I just shook my head and stood up. *Dang,* I thought as I walked off, *Ted‚Äôs absence is really taking a toll on Andrew‚Äôs sense of security.*

*‚ÄúPATRICIA!‚Äù*

*I began to call out repeatedly. but she wasn't responding. and that really started to get me on edge. she wandered off for no good reason because she's just so chaotic. and now she's not responding when we yell it. I begin to turn the corner, and then ‚ÄúBOOO!!‚Äù¬† Patricia had jumped out from around the corner and I hit my head in the ceiling of the cave. she started to laugh as I rubbed my head. I had a helmet on, however my head still hurt like crazy from the Collision with the cave ceiling.*

*‚Äú What the heck?‚Äù¬† I asked her quite angrily.*

*‚Äú I'm just having fun.‚Äù*

¬†*before I could say anything she continued, ‚Äúalso I found something that you guys need to see.‚Äù*

*I looked at her kind of puzzle, but she didn't waste much time. she turned around and immediately started to walk towards what she thought was interesting. ‚Äú wait! I need to grab John and andrew. they're still sitting and eating far away because you wandered off‚Äù*

¬†*she turned around and gave me a look of disgust, not just that I was telling her to wait, but she could taste the bitterness and the words. We walked over to the group while they were eating. Andrew didn't say anything, he just looked at us and then continued to look around. but John did not hold back a snarky comment, ‚Äú I'll look you finally found her and took you long enough. might I ask though, with a thud and the loud ow, who found who? Was it your girlfriend in crime?‚Äù*

*Patricia left, I'm glad at least somebody found it funny. but before I could tell anybody anything. she immediately started talking frantically and excitedly, ‚ÄúI found something that I really need to show you all.‚Äù¬† The group looked at her confused and you even stopped frantically to look at her to see if he could figure out what she's talking about.*

*‚ÄúW-what is it?‚Äù Andrew asked very timidly.*

*‚Äú no spoilers.‚Äù¬† Patricia said, then turned on her heel and began to walk towards it. I followed closely behind Patricia, As I was following, I heard John stumbling to get up and grab his stuff and move with us quickly. and I heard Andrew let out a faint ‚Äúwait‚Äù before following.*

¬†*we went through twists and turns, and had to even crawl through small cracks. but eventually after a few minutes of walking we finally found what got Patricia so excited.*

¬†*to all of our amazement, we were all standing at the gates of an underground city.*¬†

Chapter 3

¬†We all stood there, dumbfounded, staring at the shadowy expanse of a city.

Then I noticed Patricia shifting her weight like she was about to sprint forward. I grabbed her arm and hissed, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

Patricia flashed me a teasing grin. ‚ÄúWhy are you whispering? You afraid the monsters in the city are gonna hear you?‚Äù

I glanced back at the looming arches, chilled by the thought that she might not be joking. We had no idea who‚Äîor *what*‚Äîhad built this place. Or if anything still lived there.

That‚Äôs when John stepped in.

‚ÄúWe should explore this. Absolutely.‚Äù He swept his light across the towering stone walls. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre all thinking the same thing. We should stay silent. We have no idea what‚Äôs in here, no idea who built it, no idea what they‚Äôd think about people wandering in.‚Äù

Relief washed over me. John was being the voice of reason, stepping up when both Andrew and I were too rattled to say anything.

I turned to Patricia, still gripping her arm. She looked utterly disappointed, pouting like a kid denied dessert. I could practically see the gears turning in her head, plotting how to sneak off and mess around in the dark remnants of the city.

Before I could say anything else, John and Andrew slipped past Patricia and me, already moving deeper into the city. Their footsteps echoed softly as their headlamps swept beams of light across the stone walls.

I let go of Patricia and hurried to catch up.

We wandered through the streets for a while, silent and wide-eyed. The city was‚Ä¶ bizarre. It felt almost like an architect‚Äôs experiment‚Äîor like an AI-generated cityscape pulled from someone‚Äôs fever dream. The buildings looked vaguely human-designed, but they twisted off into impossible angles.

One square building rose straight up before tilting sharply to the left, then spiraled like a giant stone drill. Another seemed normal from the ground, but halfway up, it split open into latticework arches that wove together overhead.

Everywhere we turned, there were signs‚Äîstreet signs, business signs, billboards. But none of them had any recognizable writing. Just strange markings, geometric symbols, and looping characters that never repeated or seemed connected to one another.

It was all familiar enough to look almost normal‚Äîuntil you stared at it too long. Then the shapes and symbols started to feel *wrong*, like the city was playing tricks on your brain.

Everything about the place was just‚Ä¶ bizarre.

That‚Äôs when we stopped outside what I thought was a bakery‚Äîor a horrifying attempt at copying one.

We all stepped inside, and at first glance, it actually looked‚Ä¶ normal. Almost disappointingly normal.

Counters stretched along the front where a cashier might once have stood, ready to exchange change for trays of pastries. Along the right and left walls ran long tables, each lined with high stools tucked neatly underneath. In the center of the room, clusters of small tables and chairs waited, as if expecting customers to sit, sip coffee, and chat.

It was eerie. Familiar, yet *off*.

I found John crouched behind the counter, tugging at the cash register.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked, already annoyed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing if I can break this open and get some cash,‚Äù he said, not bothering to look up.

‚ÄúAre you kidding me, dude? That‚Äôs literally stealing.‚Äù

John let out a sharp sigh and finally glanced up, frustration in his eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been through this a hundred times. If they needed this stuff, they would‚Äôve taken it with them when they left the city.‚Äù

This had been a constant tension point between me and John. I was here for the adrenaline‚Äîthe thrill of exploring places no one else dared to go. He was here for the same rush‚Ä¶ but also to find valuable things he could take and sell.

And it always pissed me off.

‚ÄúOW!!‚Äù

Andrew screamed from the front of the store. I spun around just in time to see him flailing his hand, then shoving his finger into his mouth.

Confused, I rushed over. ‚ÄúAndrew, you all right?‚Äù

He pulled his finger out, grimacing. ‚ÄúYeah, I just pinched it. I was reaching under that chair‚Äù‚Äîhe pointed to a chair now flipped on its side‚Äî‚Äúand I think something *pinched* me.‚Äù

I stared at him, frowning, then leaned closer to look at his finger. My confusion twisted into something darker.

Because right there on the pad of his fingertip‚Ä¶ were tiny bite marks. Like a miniature set of human jaws had sunk into his skin.

Andrew and I both stared at it in silence. Finally, I muttered, ‚ÄúYou should probably wash your hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll be looking for some mouthwash,‚Äù Andrew shot back, shuddering.

Before either of us could say anything else, John‚Äôs triumphant yell rang out from behind the counter. ‚ÄúGOT IT!!‚Äù

But his voice was immediately drowned out by an eerie glow flooding the room.

All the lights flipped to a deep, pulsing red‚Äîas if an alarm had gone off.

Except there was no sound.

Just the red light, bathing everything around us in an ominous glow.

‚ÄúGood going, John,‚Äù I said sarcastically, shooting him a look.

He ignored me, staring down into the cash box he‚Äôd just pried open.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù John exclaimed, genuine confusion in his voice.

I hurried over. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, leaning in to look.

He didn‚Äôt even need to answer.

Inside the cash box wasn‚Äôt money‚Äîat least not *our* kind of money. Instead of green bills, it was filled with paper the color of dried blood, covered in strange symbols. No faces of presidents or monuments, just swirling markings scattered across every note.

And each bill was unique, like snowflakes‚Äîdifferent patterns, different shapes, no two the same.

John scowled, shaking his head. ‚ÄúCounterfeit bullshit,‚Äù he muttered, then threw the cash box down.

‚ÄúAll that effort for nothing‚Äî‚Äù

He was cut off by Patricia gasping sharply and ducking under the window.

John blinked at her, irritated. ‚ÄúWhat, the cash box clanking to the ground startled you *that* badly?‚Äù

John might have been blinded by frustration, but Andrew and I weren‚Äôt.

Patricia, who‚Äôd been ecstatic, energetic, and fearless this entire time‚Ä¶ was now trembling in horror.

Seeing her like that nearly sent me into a panic attack.

But what nearly gave me a heart attack was the look on her face‚Äîtears glistening in her eyes‚Äîas she whispered:

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

1lz2t0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1lz2t0k/get_me_out_of_110_summers_midsized_cities_pnw_co/,"Get me out of 110* summers. Mid-sized cities PNW, CO, or East Coast?","I grew up and went to college in Northern California. Today‚Äôs high is 107 degrees. I‚Äôm 26 and applying for jobs in social services or education. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in Santa Rosa, Chico, SF and Sacramento. I‚Äôve visited my friend in Seattle a few times. I like the city. The transit was easy to figure out, I felt safer walking in Seattle than SF, and I liked being surrounded by nature. I‚Äôve been looking at jobs in Tacoma since it‚Äôs in proximity to Seattle, but seems more affordable and less busy than Seattle. People warn you about Seattle and the ‚Äúgloom‚Äù, but as someone who grew up in a town where you have to spend the summer inside because its 100+ degrees outside, I don‚Äôt think the cloudy weather would bother me. I like the idea of staying on the west coast since it‚Äôs a shorter flight than flying across the country. I‚Äôve thought about Colorado, maybe Denver, but I don‚Äôt know anyone who lives in CO and I‚Äôm not sure I would want to deal with the snow. I think it‚Äôs more not knowing anyone in the state than the snow. I have a couple friends who live on the east coast. I liked Boston when I visited as a teenager, but it seems a lot more difficult to uproot my life across the country than from CA to Oregon or WA. 

Does anyone have recommendations for cities?

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:

-Cooler weather (anywhere where the summer peaks 90s max) I‚Äôm done with 110 degree summers. 
-Nature accessible within an hour. I like hiking, camping, kayaking, and enjoy a good city park to walk and read in. 
-Mid sized city, or a city with distinct neighborhoods that are easy to get around. I liked Fremont and West Seattle as Seattle neighborhoods. 
-Decent transit or walkable neighborhood (anywhere less stressful to drive in than SF) 
-More affordable rent or affordable with roommates. The reason why I‚Äôm hesitant about Seattle proper is that I don‚Äôt know if I could afford it. Most of the jobs I‚Äôm looking at pay about 60k-70k, which doesn‚Äôt get you too far in a city unless you have roommates. 
-Casual night life/coffee shops and cute stores. I like the pace of breweries, live music, but also being able to go out occasionally. I like being around young people, since I‚Äôm only 26, but don‚Äôt want to live in a college town/ night life that‚Äôs geared toward 21 year olds. 
- I like theater, art, and going to concerts. 
-I would like to go to grad school, so I‚Äôm also looking at places where there are colleges within a reasonable distance. 
-Liberal leaning. I will only live in a blue state. I‚Äôd like to build up my queer community and will only live somewhere it‚Äôs safe to be queer. 

Rent wise I would love to find a 1 bed for under 1500, which I know could be a stretch, or someplace where I could have a room for under 1k.

Ever felt like your side hustle is just a hobby? Like, you‚Äôre pouring time, energy, and a sprinkle of your soul into it, but the bank account doesn‚Äôt quite reflect the passion? Can I get an ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù? üôè

Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you that **you can turn that side gig into a gold mine**‚Äîespecially with the AI tools available now. But here‚Äôs the kicker: some of these opportunities are literally expiring soon! üï∞Ô∏è 

Let‚Äôs dive into how you can leverage AI to potentially supercharge your income. Here are a few ideas that could seriously change the game for your hustle:

1. **Automated Content Creation**: 
   - Using AI to generate blog posts or social media content. Imagine having a virtual assistant that cranks out catchy captions while you binge-watch your favorite show!
   - Tools like ChatGPT and Jasper can help create engaging content for your niche without breaking a sweat.

2. **Market Research Made Easy**:
   - Forget those long hours sifting through data! AI tools can analyze trends and give you insights faster than your morning coffee kicks in.
   - These insights can help you tweak your products or services to meet market demands‚Äîmaking that gold mine really shine! üí∞

3. **Chatbots for Customer Interaction**:
   - Build a more dynamic engagement platform. Customers expect instant responses‚Äîbut who has time for that? Enter AI chatbots to answer FAQs and guide sales 24/7.
   - This means you can chill while your digital assistant does the heavy lifting‚Äîno more late-night customer service zones! 

4. **Personalization in Marketing**: 
   - Want to up your game? Use AI to segment your audience and create *tailor-made* marketing campaigns. Picture this: your customers receiving content that feels like it was hand-crafted just for them. üéØ
   - It‚Äôs more personal, and trust me, people love feelin‚Äô special!

5. **AI-Powered SEO**: 
   - Get your website to the top of Google searches with AI-driven SEO tools. Imagine your side hustle being the go-to in your niche‚Äîthanks to some futuristic tech, it can be!

With these tools at your disposal, turning that hobby into a profitable venture doesn‚Äôt have to feel like crafting a masterpiece with your bare hands. There are shortcuts! Just remember: **it‚Äôs about working smarter, not harder**. And who doesn‚Äôt want that?

But here‚Äôs the kicker: Many AI platforms may not be around forever or may change their pricing structures soon (looking at you, subscription models). So, getting in now could mean locking in those rates while the getting is good. ‚è≥

Honestly, I‚Äôm super pumped to see what you all come up with. So, what are you waiting for‚Äîlet‚Äôs dig into these techy treasures and strike gold! Who‚Äôs working on their side hustle right now? What ideas have you been toying with?",1,1752437774.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Carved entirely by hand (yes, hand‚Äîno rotary tools, no wizardry), this cowboy started life as a Roger Stegall roughout and ended up looking like he just walked out of a saloon and straight into your TikTok feed.
