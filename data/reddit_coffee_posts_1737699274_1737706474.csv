1i8qoej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8qoej,Advice needed for DIY subfloor replacement and blocking installation.,"""Decided to install LVP in the bathroom, and this is what I’ve gotten myself into.
It seems like the previous owner didn’t care much about the house, as I’m constantly fixing or replacing something. Oh well—the joys of being a homeowner, I guess.

I was on a tight budget to hire a professional, so I decided to tackle it myself + learning experience.
I started by removing the cement sheet, cutting out the rotted OSB, and now I’m trying to figure out how to add some blocking before placing a new sheet of OSB/plywood on top.

Here’s where I’m stuck: there are about 4 inches of old OSB left that I was planning to cut out, but I only have access to 2 inches because the rest is under the drywall.
Should I cut the drywall to access the remaining OSB, or leave it as is and install the blocking?

Speaking of blocking, based on these photos, how should I place it?
Additionally, the wall on the left side (by the toilet) is not sitting on the joist, and on the other side of that wall is a two-sink vanity.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! If there’s a way I can buy you a coffee, let me know—I can Zelle or PayPal.

Thank you!"" ",1,1737706346.0,Carpentry,0,1.0,False

1i8qmve,https://www.reddit.com/r/theotherwoman/comments/1i8qmve/advice/,Advice?,"So, I'm in between a rock and a hard place. My AP (MM 45) and I (SF 29) have been together for 5 years (it will be six in February.)

When we got together, i was engaged and he was married. I felt like i needed to take care of my SO at the time, and that he had nowhere to go if i left but i was incredibly unhappy. Being with my MM made me realize how badly i had been being treated before, and when my SO at the time found out about my affair, I asked him to leave. That was 6 months into my AP and Is relationship. 

I had started the relationship off saying i didn't believe monogamy was for everyone. He seemed on board until i ended things with my fiance and wanted to start to date. At that point he cried, and asked me to wait a bit before dating. I agreed, as I have a tendency to give in just to make the person i love stop crying.

This has been a point of tension, and at some point it changed from him asking me to wait to date to him wanting to be with me. Through a set of unfortunate circumstances, very shortly after his DDay he had to move far away, with his wife. 

When he left, he told me he hadnt been sleeping with her. When i found out the opposite, i was devastated and still i stayed.

Im honestly at a point where i dont want to date anyone else. I want to be with him, but its been six years and the endless promises without any timeline is driving me actually mad.

Heres where i need some advice. I was asked out on a date by a mutual friend of ours from the time he lived near me. I dont have any real desire to date at all. Im a little broken, and im at a point where i have a hard time trusting people since ive seen cheating from every side (my ex fiance also cheated on me). But im afraid ill be stuck in this endless loop waiting for someone to think im worth it if I dont start dating. Ive known the guy for several years, and hes always seemed so nice. While i didnt feel a lot of attraction (if any) to him, i always felt like whoever he ended up with would be a lucky girl. I never really feel an attraction to someone until i start getting to know them anyway, so it isnt like physical attraction and immediate sparks are a deal breaker for me.

Should i say something to my AP before i go on this date? I dont plan on having any physical intimacy on this date. And i feel like if i say something things are going to go exactly as they normally do. Ill end up giving in and not going on the date. As petty as it sounds, theres also a part of me that thinks about how he didnt ask me before starting to sleep with his wife again. 

I plan to ask this man what he wants out of this while were on the date. I want to ask him how he feels about nonmonogamy, and if hed be interested in something more casual. If he doesn't, ill politely tell him this may not be right for either if us.

Should i tell my AP before I go? I plan to tell him after either way. Should i just say this friend wants to meet for coffee and Im open to it? ",1,1737706144.0,theotherwoman,1,1.0,False

1i8qm2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/1i8qm2s/broken_laptop_ashamed_of_being_privileged/,"Broken Laptop, Ashamed of Being Privileged","I’ve been struggling a lot with this feeling lately but it's pushed it over the edge when my the battery in my laptop recently gave out completely. It’s at the point where it has zero charge and can’t hold any power at all. I called a repair company and told my dad about it, and I’m planning to order a new battery and take the laptop in for repair. It’s about $70, and I’d need to leave it at the shop me and my dad wait around for an hour while it gets fixed.

Here’s where I’m really struggling, though: I feel so guilty and ashamed about this. This feels like such a privileged problem to have. I have a friend, who’s a mom with three kids. She’s living paycheck to paycheck and barely scraping by. Meanwhile, I’m sitting here worrying about my laptop battery, and it just feels wrong.

Even though I know it’s just $70 and I’ve spent money on other things recently, I feel like I shouldn’t be spending this on myself. I feel like I’m being selfish or ungrateful, even though I also recognize that my laptop is something that means a lot to me since my mom gave it to me, and I use it for my writing even though I haven't worked on my books in months.

I can’t stop thinking about how lucky I am that this is my biggest problem right now, and it makes me feel ashamed for even caring about it. I know everyone has their struggles, but it’s hard to shake this feeling. When my friend has a bag taped over her car window where it got stuck and other things have broken for her lately, I know she can't afford to fix them, coffee pot, heater.

Has anyone else ever felt this way—guilty about needing or wanting something when you know other people are dealing with so much more? How do you deal with these feelings? 

******

Sorry again for rambling here I just need to talk.

This is the first time I’ve really had a friend who is struggling financially. I've been very lucky and privileged always having food on the table always having a warm place to sleep lived in the same house my entire life it wasn't perfect but I was very very lucky

I can’t really help since I’m a shut-in with no job. Even if I did, I can’t just give her money. I know I’m rambling in this paragraph, but I just don’t know. I know I need to get the battery, take care of the laptop my mom gave me before she got sick, and work on my writing—which I need to do—but I’ve been putting it off because I’m scared to finish.

In my last post, I discussed the challenges of knowing a potential partner beyond hard data, such as looks, education, career, wealth, family background, caste, creed, etc. I agree that these are basic hygiene factors for first-level filtering. However, in my experience, we are often stuck with these hard facts, thinking they are enough to make a go-or-no-go decision.

Here’s the thing: Looks fade, careers can change, and wealth is… well, let's just say your in-laws’ money isn't legally yours anyway. So how do you figure out if this person is actually, you know, **liveable**?

# The Real Checklist:

Forget the glamor shots and job titles for a second. The whole point of getting married is to have someone who’s got your back—a partner who’s mature, stable, kind, and doesn’t make you want to run after every small fight.

But how do you figure all that out when all you’ve got is some Insta-worthy selfies and a family bio that reads like a LinkedIn profile? Here’s the cheat sheet:

**Don’t Be a Yes Machine**  

Met them twice and already imagining your wedding hashtag? Chill. People are on their best behavior at first. It's all smiles, charm, and maybe an “I love long walks on the beach” lie. Wait until they’re comfortable enough to let their inner gremlin show

**Know Thyself** 

Ask yourself: Am I relaxed and positive, or am I basically a sarcastic meme in human form? Self-awareness is hot. If you don’t know how you vibe, how will you know if their vibe matches yours?

**Watch Their Moves** 

Pay attention to how they act in social settings. Are they cracking jokes, being polite, and just vibing? Or are they walking around like an overworked manager at 7 PM on a Friday?

**What’s Their Focus?** 

Are they all about themselves—complaining about their boss, their back pain, their dog’s *third* vet appointment this month—or are they actually interested in *you*? Bonus points if they ask follow-up questions or make you laugh. Red flag if they’re basically the human version of a Twitter rant.

**The Ultimate Test: Are You Having Fun?** 

Are you vibing? Laughing? Feeling that little *sparkle sparkle*? Or are you low-key plotting your exit strategy mid-coffee? Trust your gut—it knows more than you think.

# The Reality Check

Here’s the deal: What you see is what you get. People don’t magically become *chill* or *mature* later. If they’re grumpy, intense, explosive or controlling now, they’ll probably still be that way when you’re deciding whose turn it is to buy toothpaste.

Marriage is all about trade-offs. You won’t get the whole package (*unless you’re Beyoncé, in which case, hi Queen*). But know where you’re okay with compromising and where you’re not.

TL;DR: Take your time, pay attention, and don’t leave your future happiness up to “luck.” Unless your idea of luck is rolling the dice on someone who can’t stop talking about their ex’s dog. 🐕‍🦺

I came to Germany with work so they did all my previous moving and I didn't need to worry - everything just appeared in my flat.

Now we are moving on our own and have ordered a removal company to deal with the larger items.

We have heard from some people (not the removal company) that on the day of moving you should provide the removal staff with drinks and snacks and lunch.

Is this really the expectation? Yes they are doing a lot of manual work but we are also paying a high price for it.

I have no issues if they need water or even a coffee but I see no reason why I should cook lunch for them, and then what - I need to sit with them and eat? There will be probably be no cooking equipment or table by that time.

Can anyone advise on this? I never got a free lunch at work apart from the Xmas meal so really do not see why I should provide them with lunch or dinner.",0,1737704968.0,germany,5,0.5,False

**Introduction**

Green tea is more than just a soothing beverage—it’s a powerhouse of health benefits that have been cherished for centuries. Packed with antioxidants and nutrients, it has become a staple for those seeking a natural way to enhance wellness. In this blog, we’ll dive into the science behind green tea’s antioxidant properties, its impact on the body, and how incorporating it into your daily life can lead to healthier living.

**What Makes Green Tea Special?**

[**Green tea**](https://www.nutsnspices.in/index.php?route=product/category&path=45_46&srsltid=AfmBOoptXJFMR4if5nU5-3MHqK4yAcFVRbDTrNXCT3hoUqH7psM87C69) is derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, the same source as black and oolong teas. What sets it apart is its minimal processing, which preserves its natural compounds, particularly antioxidants called polyphenols. These antioxidants are known to fight free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause cell damage and contribute to aging and diseases.

One of the most potent antioxidants in green tea is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been extensively studied for its health benefits. This compound is believed to play a critical role in reducing inflammation, improving brain function, and even supporting weight management.

**The Science Behind Green Tea’s Antioxidants**

Antioxidants in green tea work by neutralizing free radicals in the body. Free radicals are produced naturally during metabolism and in response to environmental stressors like pollution, UV rays, and smoking. When these molecules accumulate, they create oxidative stress, which can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids.

The polyphenols in green tea, particularly catechins, combat oxidative stress by stabilizing free radicals and preventing further cellular damage. Regular consumption of green tea has been linked to a lower risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Additionally, green tea’s antioxidants can promote healthy skin by protecting against UV damage and improving elasticity. For tea enthusiasts in urban areas like Chennai, where pollution levels can impact health, green tea can be a refreshing and protective choice.

**How Green Tea Supports Overall Health**

Boosts Heart Health: Studies have shown that green tea can lower LDL cholesterol levels and improve blood flow. Its antioxidants help protect blood vessels and reduce the risk of heart disease.

Enhances Brain Function: Green tea contains caffeine, albeit in smaller amounts than coffee, which provides a gentle energy boost. Coupled with the amino acid L-theanine, it promotes calm focus and mental clarity.

Aids Weight Management: The combination of catechins and caffeine in green tea can enhance metabolism and increase fat oxidation, making it a popular choice for those seeking natural weight management solutions.

Supports Immunity: The antioxidants in green tea can strengthen the immune system by fighting harmful pathogens and reducing inflammation.

Promotes Skin Health: Drinking green tea regularly can help combat signs of aging, reduce acne, and improve overall skin texture due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

**Choosing the Right Green Tea for Maximum Benefits**

When selecting green tea, quality matters. Opt for loose-leaf varieties or high-quality tea bags to ensure you’re getting the maximum amount of antioxidants. For those exploring [**green tea in Chennai**](https://www.nutsnspices.in/index.php?route=product/category&path=45_46&srsltid=AfmBOoptXJFMR4if5nU5-3MHqK4yAcFVRbDTrNXCT3hoUqH7psM87C69), sourcing fresh, high-grade options is essential to enjoy its full health potential.

Look for teas that are minimally processed, as these retain their natural compounds. Matcha, a powdered form of green tea, is another excellent option as it allows you to consume the entire leaf, maximizing its antioxidant content.

**Easy Ways to Incorporate Green Tea into Your Routine**

Incorporating green tea into your lifestyle doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some simple ideas:

Morning Ritual: Replace your regular cup of coffee with a warm cup of green tea to start your day with gentle energy.

Midday Boost: Brew a cup during your afternoon break to stay focused and refreshed.

Green Tea Smoothie: Blend green tea with fruits like berries, spinach, and a dash of honey for a nutrient-packed drink.

Cold Brew: On hot days, enjoy green tea cold by steeping it in cold water overnight for a refreshing alternative.

Cooking: Experiment with green tea-infused recipes, such as soups or desserts, to add a unique twist to your meals.

**Caring for Your Health with Green Tea**

For individuals who want to prioritize wellness, green tea is an easy and effective addition to a balanced lifestyle. Its antioxidants can help protect against everyday stressors, support overall health, and promote a sense of well-being.

Living in bustling cities like Chennai can expose you to environmental pollutants and hectic routines, making it all the more important to integrate nourishing elements like green tea into your day. A simple cup can make a big difference in managing stress and boosting your energy naturally.

**Conclusion**

Green tea’s antioxidant powers are a testament to its role as a health-promoting beverage. From supporting heart health and enhancing brain function to protecting the skin and aiding weight management, this humble drink offers a wealth of benefits.

Things have been great. He loves me, he is kind, always finds time for me etc etc. Anyway we started college a few months ago and he told me that he met a girl who was part of his rock climbing club. Normaly when he tells me stuff like this i get really sad because I'm honestly an insecure girl and I compare myself to every girl my BF talks with. But anyway after a few minutes I calmed myself and told myself ""ok calm down he's loyal, it doesnt matter that she is prettier or more athletic, he chose YOU"". Anyway after some time i forgot about that girl until yesterday. My bf out of nowhere told me that he had something ""funny"" to tell me. He told me that he met this girl again infront of their college building after finishing their midterms and they were talking about their classes. After finishing talking my BF asked her to go out on a coffee some day with him. When he told me this I was so confused because before starting college he said that he doesnt want female friends and would never go out with a female alone. This was all so random. I asked him ""wait, YOU asked her to go out for a coffee?"" And he was like ""Yeah but ofc in a friendly manner"". By this point I was already getting uneasy. Then he told me he texted her THE SAME DAY they were talking about going out. But apperantly she left him on delivered and didnt bother to respond. Then he laughed and said ""Can you imagine she left me on read?"" 
Ok so there are a few things that bother me about this. 
Firstly, the only person in the whole college who he asked to go for a coffee was this girl. For the record he has male collegues, who he talks to EVERYDAY, yet never went out with them, but still had the courage to ask this girl out who he only talked to like 2 times.
Secondly, he has told me time and time again how he wouldnt go out of the way to find female friends, now he decides to do a 180 for a person he spoke to twice? 
Thirdly, he admitted he didnt want to tell me about the encounter because he knew I was goong to be sad. That made me feel the lowest to be honest.
I told him if he is developing feelings for this girl he should tell me and then he started saying how im the kindest girl in the world and how I only make him feel safe. But, what if she's like that also? Also she is much more prettier than me. He also has a history of developing feelings for girls quickly. He also told me the only girl he would ever go out alone is with a girl who he is attracted to...

I'm here to make an account of my hemorrhoidectomy with pph procedure because I don't find many of those online and it might help someone.

My stats are 30(M), 175cm, 75kgs, active (gym 4 times a week very focused on bodybuilding, 10ks steps and cardio)
Grades 2 and 3 

So my doctor and I decided my case wasn't bad we should try to focus on a long term solution, I didn't bleed out of my ass but it was something that impacted my life.

That's why the pph fits my case in full, and it would save myself from the other procedure, I can't even imagine if the discomfort in this one is as is how the other one might be.


Day 0

 surgery at 18.00 in the afternoon, fully a sleep and it required no previous weird preps aside from not eating.

Woke up at 19.30, and immediately the disconfort was on a 7-9/10, not direct pain just really think I was going to shit myself or
Pee at any minute and it radiate to my balls so I was completely lost with that sensation.

I asked the doctor to go to the bathroom but had to wait to be prepared to get up from the anesthesia, which took like an hour.

Went to the bathroom, applied some pressure and there came the gauze and blood and nothing else, it help a lot with the sensation and it went down to 4-6/10.

Ate a little bit and start to get dress, my gauze was clean so I could go home.
I must outline that my world was rocked, sleepiness+coming out of the anesthesia+ the pressure sensation in my ass and bladder it was not in a good mood, all time low

Came home, couldn't event eat, just took a bath, drinked water and went straight to bed, to a bad night of sleep. Woke up every 35-60
Mins, couldn't find a position, tip to self sleep on your side with a pillow in the middle of your knees.

During the night I was finally able to pee properly which was good as I felt the pressure getting better and it was affecting my ability to urinate.

Day 1

Woke up with 6 hours of sleep I couldn't sleep more, and decided to go eat my usual breakfast (oatmeal,protein, apple and coffee) this gets me going every time and it worked as usual.

Starting having a different feeling from the pressure accompanied with a ton of farting without much control, went to the bathrooom and without effort did 3 small pebbles with some blood of poop but felt instant relief from that and the farts. Afterwards took a shower just to be able to clean myself in the least aggressive way possible with a gauze to wipe


I was dreading my first trip to the bathroom but I must say pain was a 0 so that was a huge positive, let's hope that once is a more considerable BM it remains the same.


My medication is an antibiotic, daflon and paracetamol for pain and inflammation nothing else.

I'll keep you guys updated on how things evolve

It might be good?,"I know alot of you will disagree but it is my opinion that a ground up Red Dead Revolver would be a perfect third installment to the red dead redemption series please please please read this and I would love to hear your opinions. I know it is super long.

 I understand that I am obsessing so much over something that I have absolutely no control over. It would be so perfect but I know rockstar will not do it and they would rather create another IP but I don't know how good the story would be cast under the shadow of RDR2 I hope it takes more of a spaghetti western approach, 1870s/1880s wild West would be an amazing setting for an open world video game. RDR2 was so good because RDR1 exists. RDR1 was so good because there was never a game quite like it. I rewrote the Red Dead Revolver(2004) story. I wrote a Google doc that is 12 pages long. I describe how the game would work in an open world setting with a very very large map. The story is changed to add some humanity and emotion to Red Harlow and the characters from RDREVOLVER and explore his story. I also describe how the gameplay, visuals, and cinematography would change and look. 

Landon Ricketts serves as a the mentor to a 17-20 year old Red Harlow and guides Red on his journey for vengeance and teaches Red valuable lessons about how to survive in the wild West. In missions Landon Ricketts will tell Harlow what to do and how to progress through the mission but is really Landon is guiding the player, his voice lines could change depending on how good the player is. Ricketts and Harlow would have a dynamic like Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood in ""for a few dollars more"". Jack Swift will also be a very integral part of the story and Red's life. Jack Swift along with Harlow and Ricketts form a trio that works to bring in large bounties. Jack Swift will have different motivations then Red or Landon making him more of a murder for hire. This will cause a disconnect between swift and the other two because Landon views Swift as dishonorable. Later on after a bounty Hunt mission Swift finds out that the man he was killed an innocent man who was a former business partner of the man who hired Swift. The knowledge of what he has done severely impacts Jack Swift starts an arc that sees him becoming more sympathetic and less greedy. He, Landon, and Red eventually became very very good friends as Swift's motivations shift from greed to a desire for true justice and personal hatred of governor Griffon. 

The true villains such as General Diego, Governor Griffon, and Colonel Darren are already very compelling antagonists and each will get more focus than they did previously in RDRevolver. General Diego's character must be grounded slightly and the battle of Rio Grande will be reworked to feel like something that actually could have happened in the political climate and historical backdrop of the 1870s. Griffon is the perfect antagonist for Red, he has the polar opposite ideals of Red Harlow. The game will begin on the hunt for Colonel Darren but then will quickly realize there are people much more evil than Darren such as General Diego who Darren is the right hand man of and then eventually Governor Griffon the main antagonist of Red Dead Redemption 3. A character named Silas Thorne will be added as the nemesis of Landon Ricketts and Red must aid Landon on bringing down the Thorne gang.  Thorne will be a secondary antagonist similar to Colm O'Driscoll in RDR2. Thorne has the highest bounty in the game with the hardest missions and the most skilled and dangerous gang. When this entire questline is complete Thorne is killed by Ricketts after being beaten in combat by Red but Red did not kill him immediately so that Ricketts could fire the finishing blow. The Thorne gang will slowly fall apart without leadership breaking into two fairly large gangs then into several smaller gangs often clashing amongst eachother the fate of the Thorne gang will be available to read about in the newspaper 

The player will meet and have the option to recruit several gunslingers to the camp each character can change the story in different ways, perhaps some of the men you hire are outlaws that attract unwanted attention or may betray you, one of the skills Landon Ricketts teaches young Harlow is how to read people's intentions based on body language and language cues. Advanced 3d capture will allow each AI to show physical and audible cues that the character may be untrustworthy or lying to you. The player will have the ability to bring camp members along for missions and each character will react differently in each mission and some may die if you choose the wrong member for the wrong mission effectively killing the character and erasing them from the game. Red Harlow will have to team up with his camp members for a chance against large groups of enemies. However If Landon Ricketts dies then the game will end and count as a player death, and the player will have to restart the mission. If Jack Swift, Annie Stoakes, buffalo soldier, or red wolf ""Die"" in combat on a mission they are not supposed to die they will only be injured and can be rescued if the player does not rescue them then Landon Ricketts will. When the main storyline is complete Red will either retire from gunslinging and settle down on a ranch[high honor] or die fighting US soldiers in the governor's mansion the army then decides to burn the mansion killing Red and, red is remembered as a complicated but also revered as brave, skilled, and kind-hearted man[medium honor]  


Landon Ricketts will become the Playable character as he begins mentoring his new pupil a young man by the name Frank Heck. The game will progress as you mentor Frank until he is even faster than Ricketts. The gameplay from here on out will be essentially free-play with very cooperative interaction mechanics with Frank you will be able to give him orders but if he dies it will count as a player death. Frank will handle the close up brawls while Landon covers him from a distance close enough that if he needed to help Frank he could. But it all depends on the player's playstyle 

High honor ending-
Red will be available to visit on his ranch and as Landon Ricketts you may convince Red to assist you and Frank on a quest or a bounty. Red will decline sometimes especially if his wife is present who will actively attempt to dissuade him as you try to convince him. Red may refuse but typically doesn't hesitate to ride again with his old friends. I believe this game should end on a lighter note than RDR1 or 2. Landon Ricketts with the help of Frank Heck will continue gunslinging into his elderly years and Red with his vendettas fulfilled has moved on from a life of violence to a life of peace but red never hung up his Revolver.

New features like various drugs of the wild West that provide different effects, some of them are going to affect gameplay while ayahuasca and peyote offer surreal existential cinematic and at times emotional effects. On ayahuasca Red will be transported to the desert and visited by a ghostly apparition of a native American warrior/shaman and he will walk beside Red and tell the player about Red's last while also subtly foreshadowing the future of the game's story and also speaking of John Marston and Arthur Morgan in archaic riddles that Red will not understand but the player will. On peyote ghosts of deceased characters such as his parents and his friends who die along the story line who the player may grow fond of. That way the character never truly dies and still exists in some form. He will also be visited by the ghosts of people he's killed including the bounties who red takes on during his journey. Red and Landon form complicated and at times amicable and respectful relations with enemies they had slain as they had a mutual understanding of each other. In the medium and low honor ending Landon will be able to talk to the ghost of Red Harlow via Peyote. A high honor Landon talking with a medium honor red would have dialogue about the good times they had together and Landon reminds Harlow of the good deeds  he had done in his short time here on earth. There will be different Red and Landon honor combinations allowing different dialogue options that not every player will experience the same dialogue. Each player will get a unique and fresh gaming experience every time they start from the beginning. 

There will also be different kinds of beers and alcohols each making the player act a different kind of drunk. The player can get cross faded with different drugs and alcoholic beverages leading to different effects on the player's physical health, mental health, and vulnerability stat. While cross faded on ayahuasca or peyote you will be thrown into a dream like loopy state in the dessert surrounded by men with guns and you must kill the men and as you sober up you hear your name being called, one of the gang members with the most seniority will have found you and then will scold and ridicule you for your behavior as you realize you were shooting at nothing and he or she will take you back to camp on horseback. A cutscene will play with the player making drunk conversation drifting in and out of sleep while your friend listens to your drunken babbling as you ride back to camp and then get sent to bed. In the morning the player will wake up with a serious hangover and the player must drink alot of coffee to stop the effects or wait 6 game hours. 

I Reworked all the minor antagonists to make them fit in with the HD universe for example; 

Pig josh will be renamed Joshua Swine. He will be a 6foot 7 giant who is muscular instead of fat, and wears a tattered old confederate coat and hat. He throws dynamite strategically rather than exploding himself and inexplicably not taking damage. He will also have goons that throw dynamite and have a suicide vest as well. The fight will progress in 4 stages with him becoming more volatile each phase, the third stage will have Joshua remove his coat revealing the dynamite strapped to his chest. The fourth and final phase will see pig Josh will say his signature line ""I'm gonna blow you up real good cowboy"" he lights his dynamite vest and then charges at you very fast paying homage to Josh's original move. In this phase the player must land 2 consecutive headshots and clear the blast radius of Josh. After the battle a cutscene will depict the blast then a billow of smoke rises into the air and something falls from the sky, it is the now charred confederate hat of Joshua Swine. The hat lands at Red's feet and he brings the hat to Sherrif Bartley's to collect the bounty reward. All the campy cartoon minor villains that appear at the beginning of the game have been rewritten and reworked to feel serious while still retaining the charm and humor of Red Dead Revolver's spaghetti western inspired villains. 

All bounties aside from Joshua Swine can only be collected by loading corpses onto a cart or the rump of your horse and bandits called body hunters will try to steal your bounties. All the original minor antagonists will have longer missions with multiple quests and multiple interactions with the villain creating a greater sense of character. Each character will have a visually distinct gang which attacks the player and NPCs the gangs will also clash with eachother. Once the boss has been defeated the gang is dissolved and it can be read about in the newspaper. Other smaller outlaw bands will also run rampant ensuring a chance for chaos around every corner.

Other bounty Hunters will exist creating a sense of rivalry with their names appearing on the newspaper. If you become medium or low honor you will have bounties on your head and may have bounty Hunters attack your camp as your gang sleeps. Some of the bounty Hunters can be recruited but they may not necessarily be the most trustworthy of people and may betray you in any number of ways. 

The camp will have upgradeable defenses such as alarm systems, dogs, explosives, and sentry positions and you can assign camp members different duties such as guard or Sentry duty. Some characters will be more proficient in certain skills than others such as vigilance, marksmanship, strength, riding skills, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, cooking, tracking, etc... so they can be assigned jobs accordingly to ensure the gang is running smoothly and healthily. Leisure activities will be played by the gang members to keep their nerves down, such as gambling, friendly boxing, storytelling, cooking around the campfire, horse racing, shooting contests, drinking contests, smoking cigarettes, smoking marijuana and drinking with the fellow gang members around the campfire. Some gang members will refuse to participate or may react negatively to certain activities.

1i8q7pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i8q7pv/how_to_manage_anger_and_trust_issues/,How to manage anger and trust issues ?,"Im 31F with my boyfriend 48M since about 1.5 year. We met while we were both traveling around the globe (we are still currently traveling together now). At first, I was only looking for sex/hook-up with him, mostly because I felt awkward about our age gap. He wanted a relationship, and eventually we ended up together. 

To be fair, he is a mostly a super nice person. Always here to give some help, handyman, fun, smart. Lots of small nice intentions everyday (prepare me coffee, massage me, ect). 
We have good time together and also some middle/long term projects. 

 Since the beginning, he jokes almost every week about when I will break up with him because he is too old. That's the ""easy part"" to manage.

The difficult part to manage is : as soon as he is tired or anxious, he will see bad intentions and manipulations in misunderstandings / really basic disagreements. For example : 

-> if I don't understand something he says, if he is tired he will quickly complain that I willfully misunderstand him

-> he can get really pissed off to make me repeat stuff when he doesn't get it the first time. 

More specifically:

-> he will yell (not complain, YELL) at me in the middle of the night if he wakes up and doesn't have the blanket on him because he thinks I stole it on purpose. It happened twice in total... Obviously I'm just sleeping... 

-> He is bad at communication. He says ""let's go there"". I think it's a joke because it was never the plan. I ask with amusement if it's a joke. He starts to yell at me that I don't give him any possibility to change plans. 

-> tonight, I was speaking to him about a text I wrote months ago. He told me he never read this text. I was like : I'm pretty sure you read it because I remember this specific comment you made about it. He started to yell at me saying I was lying and try to manipulate him with a fake memory. 

He literally yelled at me without thinking at the possibility he may have just forgotten about this text, or maybe I mixed up with some other text.  Anyway nothing worthing for me such an argument. But he went so crazy of the ""false accusation of reading my text"" he decided to sleep in another bed tonight. I told him before he went to bed he had to work on his anger issue, that his reaction was too much for such a small misconception, and he went even crazier like ""and now you say I have a problem ?"". I stayed calm but I'm super stressed inside. 

To be honest at this point I'm not sure I want to continue. I'm tired of this impression of him thinking I try to heart him on purpose. I'm tired of him thinking his reality is The reality (if I tell him he spoke to me badly, he will denie saying he never spoke to me badly) 

 Most of the time we really have fun and  have nice and crazy projects together (like projects we couldn't do alone because of finance and also acknowledge). I tried a few times to talk to him, saying I understand he is annoyed but I don't tolerate yelling. He always answer ""yeah I yell but also THIS happen"", like there is good reasons to act like that. 
 Also I would appreciate more curiosity and less accusation from him. 

At this point I think he will not really evolve. He told me several times he knows he has anger issues, but he never seemed to try to manage it. 

Its quite despairing to see him act like that because of obvious past traumas (grew up with some mythomaniac narcissist)... And thinking if I break up with him it will just trigger more of his trust issues 

He is definitely a sweet person and I know we all have defects. But I'm really lost on how to act. I don't know if there are possible happy endings or if I should just quit right now.

# Title: Reflections in the Wake of War

# Chapter 1: The Long Road Back

Commander Shepard woke with a sharp inhale, the world around him blurring before coming into focus. He was on the Crucible, wasn’t he? The war was over. The Reapers were destroyed. He had seen it happen. But as the world began to come into focus, something felt wrong.

He reached out to push himself up, but his body refused to respond. Something was wrong—too wrong. He couldn’t move, couldn’t feel his limbs. Fear began to creep into his chest. What was happening? He had finished his mission. He had saved the galaxy. Or so he thought.

The more he tried to move, the more impossible it felt. He was trapped—paralyzed—his mind racing with the crushing weight of realization. He couldn’t even reach for his weapons, something that had once felt second nature. Panic clawed at him, but there was no answer. There was only the sterile silence of the Crucible.

# Chapter 2: The Return to Earth

The next thing Shepard knew, he was somewhere different—a cold, broken landscape. Earth. His body lay broken on the battlefield. Harbinger’s final blast had taken its toll. He could feel the sharp pain in his chest, the unbearable ache. He wasn’t just wounded; he was crippled. His body was useless.

He struggled to turn his head, but it was no use. His vision blurred, and all he could do was watch as the Reapers continued their harvest. They were still here. The Reapers had won. He had failed.

His eyes filled with tears, not from physical pain, but from the hopelessness of the situation. There was nothing he could do. He had given everything, and in the end, it hadn’t been enough.

# Chapter 3: The Illusion of Victory

And then, suddenly, everything shifted.

Shepard was no longer on Earth. He opened his eyes to find himself in a sterile white room. It was familiar, but disorienting. There was a low hum of medical equipment in the background. As his mind cleared, he realized he wasn’t dead—he couldn’t be. But what had happened? Had he died?

A voice broke through his thoughts, soft and steady. ""Commander, you’re awake. We thought we lost you.""

Shepard tried to move, but his body felt heavy, sluggish. ""Where am I?"" His voice was weak, hoarse.

""You’re in a medical bay. You were in a coma after the final battle,"" the voice explained.

The pieces started to fall into place. He had been gravely injured. Harbinger's blast had crippled him, and he had never reached the Crucible. But this wasn’t the end of the Reapers, was it? He had to make it to the Crucible. He had to stop them.

And yet... there was a sense of peace that settled over him. A warmth that whispered, *Maybe it’s over.* Maybe this was where it was meant to end. He tried to speak again, but before he could, his mind faded into darkness once more.

# Chapter 4: The Flicker of Realization

When Shepard woke up again, he was in a different room. His body still felt heavy, and the world around him was oddly still. He blinked a few times, trying to adjust. The sterile walls around him were familiar, though the sensation in the air was suffocating.

The same soft voice from earlier spoke again. ""Commander, it's Dr. Chakwas. How are you feeling?""

Shepard tried to focus on her face. ""Dr. Chakwas... where am I?""

""You’re in the med bay on the Normandy,"" she replied gently, her voice filled with an odd comfort. ""The battle’s over. You did it, Commander. The Reapers are no longer a threat. You stopped them.""

Shepard’s mind reeled. The Reapers had been destroyed? But how? He hadn’t made it to the Crucible. He had failed, hadn't he?

Dr. Chakwas seemed to sense his confusion. ""It was close, Commander. You were gravely injured after Harbinger’s blast, but the Crucible was activated. The war ended, and you saved us all.""

He blinked, still trying to grasp the words. It didn’t seem real. He should have been there. He should have been the one to see it through to the end, not lying here, powerless.

""You were unconscious for several weeks, Commander,"" Chakwas continued, her tone softening. ""You’ve made an incredible recovery, but it will take time.""

Shepard closed his eyes for a moment, trying to digest everything. Despite the pain in his chest and the exhaustion in his limbs, a part of him began to feel a flicker of hope. He had made it through. He had won. The galaxy was saved.

But the unease still lingered. Something didn’t sit right. He didn’t feel victorious. He felt… detached.

# Chapter 5: The Shattered Illusion

And then, as if the universe had played a cruel trick, everything shifted again. Shepard was no longer in the med bay. He opened his eyes to find himself in the rubble of a broken city. The weight of the battle had left him barely able to breathe. His limbs felt as though they were encased in concrete, and his vision blurred.

A hollow sensation of hopelessness settled in his chest as he gazed out at the devastation. The Reapers were still here, their harvest continuing. He hadn’t made it to the Crucible. He hadn’t succeeded.

He was paralyzed on the battlefield, his body broken beyond repair, unable to move or fight. And then it hit him—the realization. He had failed. The Reapers had won. This wasn’t victory. It was the end.

But then, suddenly, the image faded. Shepard was back in the med bay, looking up at Dr. Chakwas, his mind in turmoil.

# Chapter 6: C's Realization

The voice that had once seemed so reassuring, now sounded distant. Shepard tried to push himself up, but his body refused to cooperate. His limbs were leaden, as if weighed down by the crushing weight of failure. He closed his eyes and tried to focus.

*But this isn’t real.*

The truth began to dawn on him—he wasn’t Shepard. He wasn’t the hero he had imagined. The truth was finally clear.

He opened his eyes again and saw not Dr. Chakwas, but his own reflection staring back at him.

Conrad Verner sat in his small, dimly lit apartment. His coffee cup trembled slightly in his hands, the steam rising slowly as he stared at it, lost in thought. The events that had unfolded in his mind—the grand battles, the sacrifices, the victories—were nothing but a dream. A dream where he was someone else, someone larger than life. Commander Shepard.

Conrad sighed heavily, running a hand through his disheveled hair. The remnants of his recent past—the arguments with his wife—flashed through his mind. Marissa had left him, accusing him of spending more time obsessing over Shepard than thinking about their marriage. The anger, the frustration, it had all built up to a breaking point. She had even accused him of being gay, of wanting to be Shepard in a way he couldn’t even understand. The harsh words had cut deep.

Conrad stared at the TV, the images of Shepard’s heroics filling the screen. The Reapers, Earth’s last stand, and the reports of Shepard leaving Earth to go gather allies. The anchors were reporting the tragic events unfolding in the battle, with Shepard’s departure being the latest part of the desperate war effort. The words stuck with Conrad, *Shepard is leaving Earth to gather the allies necessary to end the Reaper threat*.

The weight of his obsession had finally brought him to the breaking point. He wasn’t Shepard. He never would be. He was just Conrad Verner, the man who had spent years dreaming of a life that wasn’t his.

# Chapter 7: The Decision

Conrad set his cup down, his mind racing. The TV reports were growing grimmer as the battle continued. The Reapers hadn’t stopped. They were still out there, bringing devastation to Earth.

His thoughts turned once again to Shepard. The Commander had led them through the darkness, the one person who had given everything to stop the Reapers. Even though Conrad had never truly known him, he had admired him from afar. Shepard’s bravery had shaped his life, even if he had been consumed by his fantasies of becoming him.

And now, with the final assault on Earth underway, Conrad’s gut told him that Shepard still needed help. If the Reapers were to be stopped for good, if the galaxy was to have a future, it wasn’t over yet. He knew he had to do something—anything.

Conrad stood up quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. He grabbed his coat and made his way to the door, his thoughts clear now. He couldn’t just sit here any longer, pretending his life was anything more than a dream. His guilt had overwhelmed him, and the feeling of needing to be there for Shepard—real or not—was too strong to ignore.

Without thinking twice, he decided to take an emergency evacuation shuttle from his local spaceport. His destination: the Citadel. He felt in his bones that Shepard would need him, whether he was a soldier or not.

As the shuttle’s engines hummed to life, Conrad gazed out of the small window. The world outside was still reeling from the destruction the Reapers had caused, but in this moment, he had

found something greater than his obsession. He had found purpose.

Whatever happened, Conrad knew he couldn’t turn back now.",1,1737703798.0,MassEffectMemes,0,0.6,False

Rating: 6/10

Hunkal Tiger Reserve 80/20
First time trying 80+20 blend of arabica and robusta that’s not pre-ground. 
Aroma: not great, bit too acidic, and espresso also has a very strong aroma, that isn’t pleasant.
Taste: I found it to be very average (both milk based and non-milk based) leave a weird after taste. 
Method: Espresso 
Price: ₹450/500gm

Have you tried these brands? Which one would you recommend?

I like guys to be a few years older than me, and I wanted to know, is it weird/stupid for me to want to meet guys in their early 20s (20-23) when I’m 18? Is that giving “barely legal?” 

I am saving myself for marriage so that’s not a problem. I am very serious about marriage being the goal, no situationship garbage.

I have many good people in my life to offer advice and judge any men I date (lol) and I have very strong morals and values. I know what I want my future to look like and how I want to raise my kids, and what kind of man I’d love to share my life with and future.

All I need is to get to adulthood so I can meet guys I’m actually interested in without fear of getting in trouble because of my age. 

I’m moving to a new place far away soon. My plans to meet said men are joining some clubs (indoor rock climbing, west coast swing dancing, book club, church events, going for coffee regularly/being in the wild) and just generally talking with guys who seem like hubby material. (Btw I want to do these hobbies regardless of men, I’m not becoming a new person for men.)

Besides feeling like I am meant to be a wife and mother (I also have a business and career plans in the meantime, not depending on marriage happening soon), I crave the happiness I see around me.

My parents, our older friends, my best friend (26F), my boss, EVERYONE I know and value in my life are madly in love with their spouses. People ask me why I want marriage so badly; it’s because it’s all I see in my life and here I am, alone and missing that person.

To recap, am I a complete weirdo for wanting love so young? Are men going to think I’m a huge red flag because of my age? Obviously someone out there is for me, someday, but I wanted to hear some unbiased opinions.",1,1737703440.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False

I had just purchased a Budan 6-cup Stainless Steel Mokapot from Amazon for Rs. 1299. It leaks from the middle as well as the safety valve whistles in about 40 secs. It completely wets my induction stove. I had filled the water chamber just below the safety valve and also closed it tightly, but still it leaks. I’m returning it tomorrow. 

Also, 6-cup brews a lot of coffee for one person as I just use 90 ml and store 90 ml for an iced latte later. But, I don’t want to be storing coffee anymore. So, I decided on getting an aluminium 3-cup that I would use on my gas stove or on induction with a steel pan below.

Should I get the OG Bialetti Moka Express (2700 rs) or Bialetti Rainbow (2800 rs) or should I gamble again with a cheaper Pedrini Mokapot (1600 rs)?

You’re worked up about him shaving?” my best friend Lucy let out an exasperated laugh. “Since when is that a crime?” “He never shaves at night,” I said quietly. “Oh come on, maybe he had a dinner meeting!” I shook my head firmly. “Lucy, you know Nathan. Home by seven, lights out by eleven – the man runs like clockwork. He hasn’t done a business dinner in years.” “Right, because he’s too busy being madly in love with you,” Lucy countered, her expression softening. “Emma, please tell me you’re not actually worried about this?” I caught myself and managed a small laugh. 4 “Of course not.” As if on cue, my phone lit up with Nathan’s call. “Sweetheart, Jenny mentioned you hardly touched your lunch. I’ve had Mark pick up some of your favorites from Bella’s Kitchen. Get some food in you, take a little walk before your nap – and hey, I grabbed us tickets to that new Broadway show you’ve been wanting to see.” His voice carried that gentle warmth he reserved just for me, like someone speaking to their most precious person in the world. Lucy was listening in, shaking her head in disbelief. God, if anyone at Pierce & Associates could hear their ice–cold CEO right now…” I couldn’t blame her amazement.

Backstory: I moved from RI to Upstate NY in 2008 due to my dad losing his job during the financial crisis. I stayed there until 2023 when I moved to LA to pursue a career in the film industry. The industry had yet to bounce back from Covid and the strikes when these fires hit. Now with Trump as president, California is on fire, the industry isn’t bouncing back anytime soon. I’ve decided I need to move back east. My father passed away in 2022 so I have no reason (or desire) to move back to Upstate NY. So… Rhode Island, here I come!?

Here’s the thing. I know very little about the current state of Rhode Island from the point of view of people in my age bracket (mid-20s) with my interests. Here are some things I’m curious about:

1. Thoughts on the local government? Do we like the governor? Is the community good?
2. Which industries dominate the state? Which are growing?
3. What are some up-and-coming neighborhoods? Where should I rent?
4. I need some coffee shop recs. Preferably somewhere with a good cozy atmosphere where I could write
5. What is something unique about RI you can’t find anywhere else? (jokes welcomed but also looking for serious answers)

I’m excited because all of my extended family is there. I feel like a New Englander at heart, always have. I just have a very limited view of Rhode Island since I’ve been gone for so long. So I appreciate any insight anyone can give me!",1,1737702811.0,RhodeIsland,5,0.6,False

I lived in a town for a year for work and became a regular at the local bar. A few months in one of the bartenders would make small talk to me (This is new to me as I've always been introverted) and eventually After a bit of liquid confidence I gained the courage to ask for her number and surprisingly she said yes. I wouldn't say I'm the most attractive guy which is why it was surprising. Anyway, I texted her once I went home as I had work the next morning and couldn't stay for long and one thing lead to another and we were texting all night. 

  
Fast forward about a month and I had been told by work that I'll be moving to another state to help with another project. No shock to me as I move everywhere but I really liked talking to this girl and didn't know what to tell her. I got my move date which was still another month and a half away, we went on a few coffee dates and honestly she's perfect. We shared similar interests and she genuinely seemed interesting in my work.

I eventually told her I was moving away and I wanted to see her a few more times before I left which I did. Me knowing I was moving knew that if i kept talking to her while I was in another state I wouldn't be able to see her which kinda hurt me knowing that. To avoid me getting myself into too deep of a hole I started to become more dry with my texts to the point where we stopped talking for a week.

She then messaged me with the ""I miss you"" which really made me realize that I actually had feelings for her. I couldn't stop texting and apologized for just stopping talking to her.

Fast forward again, its now been nearly 6 months and we've been texting, calling, facetiming etc for the whole time and it almost feels like a long distance relationship but it's not, if that makes sense. I've never felt this way about someone before and it's scary to me because I don't want to stop. It's gotten to the point where I get worried when she goes out that she might get with other guys etc. I get that she's in a completely different state and we're not in a relationship but I get nervous and sometimes worried that she might do that.

I'm a bit stuck on what to do in this situation. I don't have many male friends to ask for advice since I move around fairly often. Should I confess my feelings for her and tell her how I feel? Anything Helps :)",1,1737702722.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Previously, I've been very generous with gifts to him, 1st birthday present to him was   
\--- a small \[Brandname1\] perfume with a DIY kiss shirt (Maison Margiela button-up kiss stain shirt attempted replica). 2nd birthday present last year was   
\--- a \[Brandname2\] cologne + a fricking new iPhone lol (but this was when I won a huge prize from something like a lottery). Now, I'm not as financially fortunate to upscale the previous gift, but still want to give something impactful.  
  
About him: He's a very gentle and classy man. Introverted and not a super emotional/sentimental person. Recently, started a new corporate job in a hot-weather country.  
  
Quick facts:  
• ⁠Hobbies: golf, chess, poker, vaping (lol), traveling  
• ⁠Not an avid movie/show watcher, doesn't really play video games, doesn't really read books.  
• ⁠Listens to all kinds of songs, but mostly calm, kinda R&B  
• ⁠Plays acoustic guitar but seemed to slowly show less interest as time went on  
• ⁠Fashion style: basic, ""quiet luxury"", doesn't accessorize too much.  
• ⁠Likes savory snacks, sashimi, a foodie, not a big sugar-enjoyer, loves coffee to an extent   
• Used to work out pretty often in college, but now can't find enough time to work out regularly, seems to enjoy hitting the gym time to time  
• ⁠Owns a dog, but the dog lives with his parents, due to school/work, he only sees the dog like once a year  
• ⁠Owns a car in his home country, doesn't have a car with him now in the new (hot-weather) country  
• ⁠Minimalist, neat freak, loves practical things  
• If I were to describe him in (random) colors/etc.: charred oak, caramel coffee, jazz (he doesn't listen to it too much tho haha...), whiskey, ...

Many of us forget the tough days once we start feeling better, but here I am, as promised, sharing what worked for me **TWICE**. 6 years ago GERD caught me off guard the first time, but the second time, I knew exactly what caused it and how to handle it. I hope my story can help even just one person here.

Here’s my story:

6 years ago, GERD hit me suddenly, with no warning. I experienced a deep, burning sensation in my stomach, severe pressure in my chest,  nausea, a constant lump-in-throat feeling, and an upset stomach that lasted for months. At the time, I didn’t know it was GERD or LPR. I didn’t yet have a family doctor, so I ended up visiting emergency rooms in search of answers. The doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong, and after suggesting an endoscopy, they sent me home to wait for a specialist—a process that, in Canada, meant waiting at least six months!

The pain worsened over time. Even drinking water aggravated my symptoms. I didn’t experience regurgitation, but I could feel and hear the acid in my throat, along with a constant pressure and burning sensation in my stomach. So, I decided to visit a walk-in clinic. One of the doctors suggested it might be GERD and recommended taking Pepto or TUMS. I had already tried both with no relief, so instead, he prescribed me Rabeprazole 20mg and told me to wait for my endoscopy.

I wasn’t thrilled about taking a PPI, especially after reading that many people’s symptoms worsened on them, but I hadn’t heard much about Rabeprazole. Any relief is better than none! so I started taking it along with some diet changes, My lump in my throat went away after 1 month and after two months, my GERD was completely gone!

Fast forward to December 2024, just three days before Christmas. GERD came back—just like the first time. I immediately knew what had caused it: I had spent an entire day on an empty stomach, drinking coffee three times. My symptoms flared up again, but this time, I knew exactly how to handle it. I followed the same regimen I had used six years ago, and after just 2 months, my GERD was gone once again.

GERD can come and go depending on my diet, but I managed to keep it at bay for six years without taking any pills. Once I saw that my stomach had healed, I weaned off the PPIs and stayed pill-free for six years. During that time, I was able to eat and drink anything without any signs of GERD or pain!

\*\* Remember you don't want your stomach to stay empty as this itself can make GERD worse, I would have small meals throught the day and snack in between - Small portions is the key! 

I truly hope my regimen can help someone out there, and that you, too, can one day share your success story. Here’s the treatment plan that worked for me:

**Medications/Supplements:**

* Rabeprazole 20mg
* DGL (as needed – it really helped heal my gut lining)
* Vitamin D with K3
* B Complex
* Melatonin 3mg (at night)

*If you’re not interested in all the supplements, I recommend at least taking the PPI and DGL, as they were essential for my healing.*

**Daily Regimen:**

**Morning:**

* Take Rabeprazole 20mg on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before eating.
* Breakfast: 1/3 cup oatmeal made with water, a little honey, and a sprinkle of cinnamon (adjust based on what you can tolerate).
* 30 minutes after breakfast, make herbal tea (nothing caffeinated, like green tea). I prefer teas like lavender or chamomile—something soothing.

**Snack:**

* Raw almonds. I would eat them even when I didn’t feel like it, as they really helped neutralize stomach acid. Sometimes, I’d blanch a handful in water and keep them in the fridge; this helped the skin to come off and make them easier to digest.
* Herbal tea throughout the day along with 1L of water minimum 

**Lunch:**

* Bland soup made with turmeric, salt, and chicken stock. I’d add chicken breast, but in the beginning, it irritated my stomach, so I mostly relied on bone broth. I always included turmeric because it’s anti-inflammatory.

**Dinner:**

* Grilled veggies, potatoes, or more soup—whatever was gentle on my stomach.

**Before Bed:**

* Take melatonin and sleep on your left side with your head and shoulders elevated.

**Bonus:**

* I also drank flaxseed water in the morning. I’d soak flaxseeds in a jar of water overnight and drink a tablespoon of the flaxseeds in the morning. You can skip this step, but studies suggest flaxseeds help strengthen the LES ) along with almonds.

I really hope this regimen helps someone out there. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I’ll do my best to answer. Good luck to all of you on your journey to healing!

I'd currently be just a few hours awoken, holding the tears back from knowing ""there's no going back now"". Even with having fully known this day would come for 21 years prior. In the evening, my compassionate icu nurse tells me shes maxed out the blood pressure meds and its time to chill the fuck out or take a xanax dude. 

I took a xanax indeed.

Man was that first week rough. But boy did i sure try to get up every few hours for a stumbling walk and a cup of tea that ""i can make it myself dag nabbit!"". Then again i lost count how many pee jugs those angels of the ward emptied for me. I had coffee and bacon the following morning, so dont feel bad asking if thats your tongues desires. You might be surprised with whats kosher. 

If your there now.. You'll get through it! 

One more day done is another day farther away from surgery! Use that dang inspirometer and by golly use that new heart! But with little walks before little runs ay. 😉

Today my phone clocked me going 37mph strapped to a piece of fiberglass floating down a hill covered in white water.

Today i found my secret powder stashes still untouched this far into the season. Truely showing they're mine to be enjoyed by me, alone, indeed.

6 months ago, i could of told you the nitty gritty of how to stop AND restart a heart without hurting it. Today i question how to rebuild a simpler coagulant machine without flooding factor 7 activates that need batch verification with ISI adjustments.

Today i went snowboarding and it was bliss. I enjoyed myself some light beers and ducked the ropes to the good sppts until the lifties stopped carrying me up the hill.

I hope you dont let your upgrades interfere with your passions. I got myself a mechanical valve, ascending tube repair (apparently forever friends with surgeon because of this piece), atrial clip (for early prevention of afib), and sternal plates (for being a 35M thats loves riding 2 wheels and shreding on 1 edge.) 

I plan to use this new little ticky tick to its fullest. And I hope you do too. (Its why we got it fixed, right?)

This is my 2 cents of appreciation. To the long time lurkers here to help all, once again: thank you! I however am getting off all the socials for living in the now, but i had to share:

i'm older, so i remember when we only tipped in full service restaurants, and not for every little thing.

BUT,

who you should be blaming are these merchant services, credit card processors, THE CORPORATIONS.

every one of those touchpads that prompt you for a tip after ordering at the counter are trying to make more money for the corporations. whatever POS system these guys are using make a % of the transaction. if they can get you to tip, they run up the bill, and get a greater % through the total of the transaction.

I guess this sounds ridiculous but I’m legitimately losing my mind. 
So I was diagnosed very early 20s, ~10 yrs ago, and the fatigue is just absolutely brutal. 
I have a job now where I’m very active so I don’t want to hear bs about exercise. I’ve tried it all. I’m still tired down to my core constantly. 
My last neuro put me on Nuvigil for fatigue but it plummeted me into the worst depression of my life with 0 cause besides the new meds. I was just sobbing uncontrollably and I refuse to try that shit again. 
I guess the root of my issue goes back to my childhood… doesn’t it all? 🤦🏻‍♀️
My mom was, and I say this still loving her, a bitch. She absolutely had some undiagnosed or at least undisclosed mental issues. I’m an only child so I was *the* target if dad wasn’t around. 
I was always tired. The older I got, the worse it got. High school? Being out for long on very hot days would knock me out. My mom would berate me constantly that I was just lazy; lazy and going nowhere. She told everyone she could how goddamn lazy and essentially useless I was. It made me want to over perform to prove myself. I personally knew I wasn’t lazy because I didn’t even have energy to do things I enjoyed, forget stupid homework… but I of course began gaslighting myself. By my late teens right before symptoms started popping up I was working 2 jobs and barely had a social life. And she’d still call me lazy and tell me I’d go nowhere because I could never finish what I started. Idk where that second bit came from. 
Now my psycho mom is deep into Alzheimer’s. And I mean, deep. She lives w my dad (primary caregiver) in the apartment below me (secondary caregiver) and my partner (my main source of support lol). 
After decades of being told I was just lazy and not trying hard enough, it became embedded in my psyche. On days off of work I’ll say I’m gonna rest but I never can. I’m always getting distracted by things I need to do around the house. 
Even now, I’m off tomorrow, worked a really chill and smooth closing shift this evening, and I have no obligations for the night, yet here I am on my couch sitting upright, constantly reminding myself to loosen my muscles (they just tense right back up the second I get distracted) and for the fucking life of me, literally, I can’t just power down. 
Mom also made me take care of my grandma who had Alzheimer’s, and I adored my grandma, she was really like my mom first, honestly, so I accepted it with great reverence and did my best even though I was freaking 11/12 when that saga began. 
So being called lazy hurt. Especially when she was out having affairs while I cared for her mom. 
But that’s the past. Now I’m an adult and I cannot fucking relax. I don’t know how. I don’t know how to put others needs out of my head and just freaking rest. 
I also now feel like my partner relying on me to be on top of bs like ordering dinner (honestly every freaking meal, he just asks me, never does it or offers now that I think of it, has only ordered food when it’s just him and his friends here am hanging out and I’m not home), keeping up with general household needs (literally everything our dog needs I buy, I keep stock and track of our cleaning supplies, appointments for the dog and especially myself, I’m the only one who does the dishes, plus I have to maintain my parents supplies for mom’s care and their apartment’s cleanliness) 

I feel like the second I hear my parents moving downstairs or my bf waking up, I’m instantly on high alert. Like, oh good, what did I do wrong now… and that’s all stemming from my freaking mom. I think that’s why I allow it. I’m working on boundaries finally but like… how do I begin to absolve myself of this needless guilt? How do I rest and not care about anyone else but myself for a spell? I genuinely don’t know how. 
My entire life has been caregiving. I’m still working out my own identity because of this. And with MS I need my rest because if I don’t rest, I can’t do anything, and if I lose the job I finally love I’ll be a complete wreck. 

Does anyone have advice? How to shut up the nagging “you’re lazy… you didn’t get your boyfriend that coffee… you woke up late, make sure the dog got fed… dad has a dr appointment I have to go down and watch mom today… etc”
I can’t relax. I’m prescribed anxiety meds and they still do not help this. My therapist doesn’t have much useful advice. My psych is insightful but nearly impossible to reach when I need him. 

I just want to rest.
That’s all I want. I’m on the verge of tears, yet too exhausted to cry at all.

Are there things anyone can recommend that I can tell people in my life that ideally shouldn’t cause drama to reiterate how bad this illness’s fatigue is? How much I need to just be left alone and not nagged about bullshit?
More importantly, does anyone have advice about how to at least care more about my need to rest and recuperate more than what everyone else needs all of the damn time? 

I feel so stupid for this. I feel like I let these things happen. But I’m a fucking people pleaser and I’m trying to get better. 

I’m open to all insight. I just want to be able to go “hey I actually took care of myself today”. 

Sorry if this is stupid. I know the issue with my partner is partially my fault. He’s so understanding til he isn’t. 
I’m also naturally hyperactive (adhd) so sitting still makes me hate myself. I lay and ruminate instead of actually resting. But I need the rest. God I can’t believe I just aired all that out but it’s become so brutal on me. I can’t even do the things I want to do…

Next, integrating a good quality **refrigerator** is non-negotiable. Look for energy-efficient models that offer ample storage and innovative features like adjustable shelving and temperature controls. Additionally, a compact **dishwasher** can save valuable time, keeping the kitchen tidy with minimal effort.

Don’t overlook small appliances, which can add convenience and versatility. A **blender** is ideal for smoothies and soups, while a robust **food processor** can handle chopping, slicing, and mixing with ease. For coffee enthusiasts, a premium **coffee maker** can elevate your morning routine.

Lastly, investing in a high-quality **toaster oven** can provide the functionality of both a toaster and an oven, perfect for quick meals and snacks. Look for appliances that enhance efficiency while fitting your personal style and kitchen layout.

As you settle into your new home, carefully selecting the right **home kitchen appliances** will not only enhance your cooking experience but also reflect your lifestyle and culinary preferences.

Being organized, attentive to detail, communicative, able to adapt, multitask, and prioritize are essential for my job. 

I have my weekly tasks and to-dos, but I’ve recently noticed they’ve been getting pushed aside for more urgent matters, very frequently. Like a wire that needs to get out at the last minute; or one of our top clients needing a copies of documents.

A lot of my work is over email (Outlook), but I do get the bankers and other employees popping into my office when they have a question (or when they just want to make conversation while waiting for their coffee to finish brewing). Interruptions are a constant part of my day.

Also, I have ADHD and anxiety, both of which I take medication to treat (in my late twenties now, got diagnosed a couple years ago).
I’ve tried using planners (can’t remember to open the planner and write stuff down).
 I’ve tried using a notepad to write out my to-dos— it helps until I get urgent or random interruptions and then I get derailed and don’t touch the notepad for 2 days.

In Outlook, I organize “By Conversation” so it’s cleaner and I can remember what’s happening. I use a lot of folders and move stuff from the main inbox into the folders once completed or finished with the task until it needs to be revisited. I use the calendar so I don’t forget meetings or super important dates, but I’ll set a daily reminder to take my lunch and literally ignore the reminder (this is one of my annoying ADHD things where I see the thing, say ok, and forget about it immediately).

I feel like I am chained to my desk, working long days and yet still don’t feel like I get anything done. I enjoy my work and my job but I’m so tired and I hate feeling like I’m slacking.  I would love any advice. Thank you!",1,1737699904.0,TimeManagement,0,1.0,False
