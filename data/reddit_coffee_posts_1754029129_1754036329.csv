## Key Features Analysis

The market for chocolate spoons is diverse, ranging from simple designs to elaborate creations. Identifying the key features that contribute to a high-quality chocolate spoon is crucial for making an informed decision.

**Chocolate Quality:** The most significant factor is the quality of the chocolate itself. Look for spoons made with premium chocolate, preferably with a high cocoa content (at least 50% or higher). this ensures a rich, intense flavor and a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The sourcing of the cocoa beans is also a significant consideration, with ethically sourced and sustainably produced chocolate being highly desirable.

**Spoon Material:** The material of the spoon affects its functionality and aesthetic appeal. Options include stainless steel, plastic, and even edible materials such as cookies or wafers. Stainless steel is durable and reusable but may conduct heat. Plastic is lightweight and inexpensive but may not be as aesthetically pleasing. Edible spoons offer a unique experience but may not be as practical for multiple uses.**Design and Shape:** The design of the chocolate spoon influences its ease of use and visual appeal. Look for a spoon with a cozy handle and a bowl that is appropriately sized for dissolving the chocolate. Intricate designs and decorative elements can enhance the overall experience, making the chocolate spoon an elegant addition to any beverage.

**Flavor Infusions and Add-Ins:** Many chocolate spoons are infused with additional flavors or contain various add-ins,such as marshmallows,sprinkles,nuts,or spices. These elements can add depth and complexity to the chocolate experience. Consider your personal preferences when selecting chocolate spoons with flavor infusions and add-ins.

**Packaging and presentation:** The packaging of chocolate spoons can significantly impact their suitability as gifts. Look for attractive and well-designed packaging that protects the spoons and enhances their visual appeal. Individually wrapped spoons are ideal for hygiene and convenience.

**Shelf Life and Storage:** Chocolate spoons should have a clearly indicated shelf life to ensure freshness. Proper storage is essential to prevent melting,discoloration,or changes in texture. Store chocolate spoons in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

About to start our 5th IUI cycle (on day 2). One chemical pregnancy. Went to pick up more meds & needles today.

This last disappointment has just been a little heavier than the others, especially after the chemical pregnancy.

Ive got misdirected anger & resentment towards my partner. They weren't quite as supportive as I would have liked during the last cycle, but that because they were literally sick and struggling with thier own mental health. They've made a sweet gesture now to make up for it, and it means a lot, but my brain needs something to be upset about. It wasn't thier fault though. These feelings aren't fair to them.
 
And the thing is, even though to a certain extent we're in this together - we're doing the hope/disappointment cycle together - there's a large part of this I'm doing alone. I'm the only one doing this physically. Im the only one injecting myself and taking supplements the size of my thumb and using suppositories and having catheters threaded past my cervix and bleeding and cramping etc. 

They're not doing any of that. 

And there's at least part of the emotional journal they're not on - when they go to bed they can at least sleep knowing there's literally nothing more they can do. They've done everything they can. They have already given 100% 

I'm there trying to sleep, wondering. Is Decaf coffee still too much caffeine? Did I have too hot of a shower? Did I have too many cheat days on my diet? Is drinking during my bleed still a bad idea? Is the one day I forgot to take Folic Acid important? How many more slivers of joy can I take off my life in order to really give it my all and have a better chance of this working? Is this all karma for when my ex made me have an abortion in my early 20's? Is this because 10 years ago I was on birth control? Am I not giving 100%? Could I be doing more? They don't have to wonder about all of this.

None of this is thier fault, of course, its not a suffering competition. But this is all on me currently. We were lucky enough to have cash on hand for the first three cycles, took out a loan for the next three, after that hopefully we qualify for one round of IVF on the NHS (postcode lottery). After that? I don't know if we can afford to keep doing this. I'm also the only breadwinner (they're disabled) so its on me to both get pregnant and afford getting pregnant.

He looked sweaty as if he has been walking all night. That wasn't what caught my attention. It was the fact he didn't even flinch when I tried getting his attention and knew the low energetic minimum wage teens name.
Jeff looked up at him through his messy bangs and glasses. 
""Oh uh, ok, ill bring you to your seat. We usually dont get customers in the morning. At seven. In the morning. For a burger.""
He said as if he just got done hearing a 4 hour long lecture about acorns. He walked him to one of the booths in the corner of the room and gived him a menu. 
Christine was still sleeping in the fetal position on one of the red leathery booths. I just sat there watching Zach get handed a coffee while he happily looks out the window next to him humming something to himself. 
I needed to know what happened. Did that green waiter Ed drug him when he stuffed that pice of raw meat down his throat? Did he call for backup? Is there anything we can do?
I stood up to go walk to him but with each stepped i noticed that I moved faster. I felt better. I didn't feel my leg pushing my fat up with each step. 
The dishwasher water jar had worked. I lost weight but not all of it. There was lose skin hanging from my arms and I still had a bit of fat but I could tell it was slowly started to dissappear. 
""Ah Tyler good to see you! Come have a seat with me"" 
Zach said inviting me over casually as if he forgot everything from last night. Hell I wish I could too. 
""Zach what the hell is going on?""
 ""Im ordering breakfast of course, cmon have a seat ill pay for your meal.""
 ""But you lost your wallet when you gave it to cody."" I reminded him. 
The memory of him kicking and screaming for help as we were all powerless against that thing haunted me still. What if Fred came back and got one of us? At this point I knew there was no saving Cody. Even if we did, how could you just live past that.
""Thats alright, I went to a atm last night and took a deposit out.""
 ""You... you went to a atm. Where?""
 ""I think possibly north west. Or maybe east. Actually maybe it was south west. Not sure."" 
Jeff had arrived with Zachs order. It was that same type of bug I remembered from last night. It had look like a hairless white puppy with pale purple wings clipped and gray eyes of a blind person. 
Zach grabbed his butter knife and immediately sliced its stomach open and grabbed his spoon to scoop up its small organs. It grabbed its feet and stared laughing like a baby as if it enjoyed getting eaten from the inside out. 
It moved around on his spoon like jello and stayed perfectly intact and didn't spill out from around the spoon. 
I quickly turned around and had to look away. The sounds of a slurping noise and a satisfying hum and a deep swallow filled the room. I threw up right then and there. 
""Woah Tyler are you alright?"" He asked, generally concern coming from his voice. 
""Dude how the hell could you eat that!"" ""Relax Tyler, its just food."" Jeff took the tray back with the bug pup. ""Would you like a refill?"" ""Actually, I think i will."" ""And you sir?"" Jeff had asked me ""are they even human."" I asked him seriously ""only me."" He replied before leaving. ""Tyler what's your issue, this place isnt even that bad."" ""Are you even the same person. Did you even try to get help?"" ""... and it thought I could just enjoy my breakfast with my best friend."" Jeff returns again with another bug pup on a tray. 
""Is this g-"" Jeff instantly gets cuts off as loud radio static comes on in his headphonds and pierces his ears, loud enough for everyone to hear and even made Christine start to wake up. He falls to the floor and frantically messes with the volume dial on them to lower the volume before pulling down the small microphone attached. He seemed worried about all of this. ""Yes sir?... right...oh, new employee...right."" he immediately stops what hes doing and gets up and heads to the kitchen. 
Christine stretches her arms, her hair messy and yawns before opening her eyes and looks around frantically. ""No. No i still must be dreaming."" I started walking to the other side of the wall where she was. ""Hey Christine everything is fine right now. Zach came back but I think they did something to him.""
 She looked up at me and grabbed my jacket desperately. ""WHERE'S CODY?"" ""Soon."" Ted said from behind me. I didn't even knew he was there. ""This is going make number 005 lose more of what's left if nobody breaks the cycle. Such pityy, I was growing fondly of the last employee to."" 
He said in a serious tone before again turning dumb. ""Durrr! I hope the color is blue again!"" He said while doing a paddle like motion with both hands while walking back to the kitchen doors as if he was trying swim his way back. 
""What. What the fuck did any of that have to do with Cody... where the fuck is he!"" She layed her head down on her knees and started to cry. I didn't know how to help so I just kept reassuring her that everything is going be alright even if it was a lie. I didn't know what would happen in the next minute of this place. It could be filled with customers in the blink of a eye. 

A few horrors went by. I was starting to get hungry but didn't wanna risk anything. During that time I examined the building a bit more. There where some old pictures of past waiters. They all looked normal but one couagth my attention.
It was Fred but he didn't look so horrific. Other than that the picture was nothing interesting, just him standing with other waiters. But something was off, he seemed to be the main focus, as if he just achieved something great. 
I got bored and started walking around the building with my palm running against the wall until it slipped through and I found a invisible door that took me to a hallway that only leads to a girls only bathroom. I went inside just because well I figured nobody was in there and maybe it had something useful. 
When I walked in I immediately smelled three difference smells that dont mix well. Rotten cheese, shit, and whatever smell was coming from a small bin filled with tissues. I looked around and saw purple stalls with dark green floors and blue tile ceiling with slices of cheese that where thrown up there and dried against the ceiling. 
I saw a vending machine and went to it only to find out its not anything I will want to eat so I started heading back but the door was gone and I heard a flush from one of the closed stalls. Crap. A woman slammed open the door and headed to the sink before turning towards me. 
She was another waiter i haven't seen before. I dont know of any names that end with a 'ed' in them for a girl so I couldn't use something lazy to call her. She wore black jeans, a yellow vest with a yellow and white striped shirt underneath along with yellow strands of hair tangled with her black hair. Her skin was pale like the others and had a grayish tone to it. 
""May i help you sir?"" She said in a sassy tone. ""Oh I was just-"" i got cut off as she walked towards me and grabbed the back of my shirt callor and threw me out throw the invisible doors and back into the main diner.
 When I got up I saw Zach was getting ready to eat a bacon cheese burger and even saw him checking each layer to make sure he didn't find a hidden ear. I turn to my right and there was another waiter. He was staring at Christine holding out a note pad to take her order. 
I could tell his color was pink from the obvious color choice of only white and pink. 
His back was turned against me but I could see Christine was crying but smiling with a shocked impression. ""Hey Christine what's happening?"" I ran towards her. While doing this i realized I could actually run now from the amount of weight loss. ""TYLER HES BACK!"" ""Who?"" The waiter turned around. 
""Hello Tyler, may I take your order?"" It was Cody. He had pure white skin with painted pink freckles on. His hair was dyed bright pink and even grown longer and more into the style of the other male waiters. His voice even changed. His legs looked fine. He had eyes but I could tell they weren't his because they weren't blue, his pupils where a empty small black void. 
This wasn't Cody, it was just the shell of him. ""Christine... no."" ""Tyler its him!"" ""Christine... he's-"" ""may I take your order?"" He asked again while I was talking. ""I dont care, just leave."" ""Hmm, ill just pick something out for you then."" He wrote something in his note pad and left.
 Christine looked at me rudely ""Tyler what the hell!"" ""Christine that isn't him anymore hes gone."" ""hes still coming back with us."" ""Thats fine but if he starts trying hurt one of us then he's out."" 
Zach finished his food and got 3 different large cups of different sodas. He placed them on me and Christines table and sat down.
 ""Listen. Im not sure im going make it out of here. Whatever happened last night changed me. I wandered through desert all night and made it to a town 5 hours from here if we walk. I took out a deposit and bought a gas canister and filled the car with it."" ""Why are you now telling us this?"" I asked him head on. 
""The food made me do it."" He looked down at the table and almost broke down and started crying before he quickly realized he had three sodas and began quickly slurping one down. ""I cant stop."" He says while twisting the plastic lid off and chugged another cup down. 
""My body needs it. Im sorry but until im full i cant help anyone."" He walked off while drinking his last soda, i could hear him trying not to cry. This wasn't like Zachary. Before I knew it we all changed. This was supposed to be a happy trip to meet zachs grandmother. None of this was supposed to happen. We didn't belong here. 
All I did was lay my head on the table and hope to god that we get out of here before my stomach pains comes and I try to not eat anything because by now i was starting to gain a appetite. Maybe having something wouldn't be so bad after all. Its just food.

Alright, my fellow time-savers! Let’s get real for a second. Ever felt like there just aren’t enough hours in the day? 😩 You wake up, tackle your to-do list, and somehow end up wondering where all that precious time went! 

Imagine if you could wave a magic wand (or hit a button) to automate **one** daily task. What would that be? More importantly, how would you do it? 

**Here’s what I’m thinking:**

1. **Morning Coffee Maker** 
   - Let’s kick things off with the number one fuel for adulting: *coffee*. If only we could train our coffee machines to start brewing as soon as our eyes open, right? 
   - You can set a timer or invest in a smart coffee maker. **Imagine waking up to the aroma of fresh brew without lifting a finger!** ☕️

2. **Meal Prep Madness**
   - What if you could automate your meal prep? Meal kit subscription services are growing like crazy!
   - You can set up a schedule to receive ingredients delivered to your door each week. **Talk about one less decision to make!** And who doesn’t love the surprise of a new recipe? 🍳

3. **Laundry Folding**
   - Okay, hear me out. Folding laundry ain’t glamorous – it’s practically a workout for your patience. 
   - There are now folding machines that could literally *do the folding for you*. Or, at the very least, smart baskets that fold and separate clothes – making everything feel like it’s part of the future! 👕

4. **Social Media Scrolling**
   - Are you like me, someone who falls into the rabbit hole of social media? 
   - Automate the posts you share with social scheduling tools! You can load up your content and let the app take care of the rest, giving you back *that time* for more important stuff. You know, like staring blankly at the wall. 😂

5. **Grocery Shopping**
   - Grocery shopping can suck up SO much time. If only we could just order all our essentials online and have them delivered fresh to our door!
   - Last-minute ingredients? No sweat! Set up a subscription service for your household staples… or just hit up the grocery app. **That’s what I’d call winning!** 😎

**So, what would you automate?** Would you hit the snooze and let your coffee brew itself? Or maybe get rid of the *never-ending* chore list? 

Let’s dream big here, friends, and think about how much more time we could free up to do the things we love – like getting outside, hanging out with friends, or simply enjoying a few peaceful moments. Life is too short to spend it grinding away at tasks that could be automated.

It was a long day at work and I had only eaten oats for breakfast. I was running on coffee the whole day and now I was hungry.

""I said I hear you, just a few minutes,"" I said, looking for a food shop or restaurant.

Far into the distance I saw a signboard with bold glowing letters. ""BURGER FEELS."" I read out the name. ""Look, we found something!""

I parked my car and made my way to the main entrance. A giant glowing burger above the door flickered to welcome me.

""Jeez,"" I said before opening the door and found a table. Which wasn’t hard because the restaurant was mostly empty. A family with two kids sat not too far from me and were already picking up their things to leave.

""What would you like today, sir?"" a waiter said, handing me the menu. There were all sorts of burgers—different flavours, vegan, different meat options. I rolled the pages to find one at the very end: Burger Feels Special – Burger so good you will feel like one.

""Haha, what!"" I chuckled. It was a weird claim—who feels like a burger?

""I'll have this one,"" I said, handing back the menu.

""Are you sure?"" the waiter asked with a concerned look.

""Yes, I'm having the special today."" He nodded and went back to the counter. The person at the counter shot me a look.

""Weird people,"" I said, waiting for my special burger.

The waiter brought the burger. It looked awfully simple for a special burger—cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and a patty.

""We hope the wait was worth it, sir,"" the waiter said before putting the plate down and left.

""Oh, God,"" a moan left my mouth as I took the first bite. It was really that good.

""They weren't lying,"" I said before taking another bite.

""Well I do feel like a burger,"" I said jokingly with a laugh. But that laughter faded the very next moment.

My chest throbbed with pain, I couldn't breathe. I tried to get up but collapsed on the floor with my knees bent.

My legs started expanding. The chest pain was getting unbearable. I, in a hurry, opened up my shirt and bam—huge green leaves of lettuce sprung out of my chest.

""No... what is happening, help!"" I screamed. But the waiter looked at me once and looked away.

I opened my shirt further. Dark grill lines started appearing on my stomach, the colour turning a dark brown. My legs were now merged into one and were expanding into a big round blob. I tried moving my arms but they were red and melting. I couldn't even look down. My neck was expanding into a giant tomato slice.

I tried to look away but my head felt too heavy. Something soft and white was making its way out of it—like bread.

""No!"" I opened my mouth to scream but a lot of cheese came out of it. I could no longer move. There was no going back. I accepted my fate.

In the end, I felt like a burger.

• Analysis contains in-depth comparisons of inconsistencies within forum's base ID numerations, suggesting that thread with so called ""proof"" is 100% modified and ""fake"". 
• Analysis contains proof that Serg_Skibidi, despite being last seen in 2020, has 2022 post link attached to his page. 
• Analysis contains heavy suggestion that all comments in the thread are fake or AI generated. 
• Analysis also contains empirical test-forum findings which is based on the same software and version the kharkovforum is, allowing to test forum's capabilities and figure out consistency of it's structure.
• Archive also contains analysis of Next Level Apps owners activities, relations to other companies, involvement in crimes and scams.

1meqkgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1meqkgp/am_i_wrong_was_it_my_fault/,Am i wrong ... was it my fault ??,"Am i wrong ... i just broke up

This is the first real romantic relationship I’ve ever experienced, and I’m not sharing it to brag — far from it. It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that’s a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let’s begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there — she’s a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She’s kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone — very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I’m not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn’t think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive — I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She’s very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn’t an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual — and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn’t reply right away. Sometimes she’d disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn’t see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don’t judge me too quickly — just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay — but after I graduate. She also said I’m not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn’t reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story — so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn’t been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, “I would’ve sent you more if I knew you weren’t busy.”
(I know you’re probably thinking, “What a fool,” but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied — but calmly and distant.

Here’s something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her “close friends” and posted that same story again — but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn’t understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn’t ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment — her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together — cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts — everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, “Okay, give me 3 days and I’ll let you know — but only if you’re not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.”

Three days later, she said “okay” and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she’d say things like, “I don’t know how I feel toward you yet — maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.”

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were “just friends.”

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme — and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio — she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn’t ghost or block people. She said she doesn’t treat people like second options.

She hadn’t blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her — no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

“If silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.”

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I’m not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it’s me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me — but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid — even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

But honestly ... am is it was my fault or my bad ?? She just blocked me for soemyhing idid and maybe idont know and she tried to reach me but though am the one who cancelled on her ??




Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Edit: btw i tried to talk about girls in some place then she showed jealous idk if she were acting but she was playful jealousy

So I'm wondering, is Fitbit accurately reading kcals out? Can those readouts be trusted? Showers is the only time I'm not wearing it.

Reasons being I'm hovering around 76-80kg since I've been trying to lose weight and don't seem to be able to. In sedentary phases I prepare my own food and weigh everything, count every splash of milk in the coffee and Cadbury eclair. In active phases I don't cook for myself so use estimates, erring on the overestimation, but can't really know for sure. My protein is usually only around 40-60g and I'm suspecting a significant amount of water due to said condition.",1,1754035299.0,fitbit,0,1.0,False

I've been suffering with IBS-D for 10+ years and the first ones were hard because I couldn't believe that my body didn't like some tasty foods that everyone else eats without issues.

If you have IBS-D, you need to check for this even if you are in denial (I was in denial for years).

1. You might be lactose intolerant. I am. But you can still buy lactase pills in that case. The enzyme your body doesn't produce to process lactose. You can just buy it from Amazon or similars.
2. You might need to go gluten free even if the doctor says you are not celiac. (Yes, I stopped gluten and my gut got much better). For snacks I have a lot of rice cookies with honey and some fruit.
3. I had to quit (or reduce) coffee, tea, and other stimulants.
4. I don't consume sugar at all now. Only honey and fruits when I want something sweet.
5. Find which fruits and veggies work for you. Some work, some will flare you up!
6. Your main beverage should be still water. Be careful because even zero calories sodas can have irritating sweeteners.

It sounds like it sucks to have so many diet limitations, but it doesn't fully. I can have some fruits, some veggies, eggs, fish, red meat, chicken, potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes, carrots, etc, etc... I usually rotate the same four meals lol. But you don't have too. There are so many meals you can cook. I'm just a bit lazy.

It took me more than one year to understand I had a sugar addiction and a soda addiction. I was in denial. Same for my lactose intolerance. I still wanted to consume dairy even though my body was clearly not producing lactase enzymes anymore. They don't tell you in the TV advertisements that yogurt can wreak your gut, for instance... they don't tell you that all the food they advertise is not for everyone. And they should. Because we evolved for millions of years and most people were not consuming the foods and drinks they are selling to us now. Not every body can take these new ""normal foods"".

I liked consuming 3 or 4 teas in the morning and afternoon. But my body doesn't like it much. The first two weeks of abstinence were hard but now I function perfectly without it.

Fellow IBS-D sufferer, we are all different, but read and re-read the list above and tell me if you are not willing to try skipping certain foods and drinks for some time to check if it works for you.

Now this is about diet. It's also good to check if you don't have Bile Acid Diarrhea, parasites, or other conditions.",1,1754035216.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

*Where the Dolphins Are the Favorite, the Warriors Are a Work in Progress, and the Odds Are as Confusing as a Rugby Ref’s Whistle*

### 1. Parse the Odds: Math That Makes You Question Your Life Choices

Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. The **Dolphins** are the favorite here, with odds ranging from **-150 to -160** (depending on the bookie), translating to an implied probability of **61-62%**. The **Warriors**, meanwhile, are priced at **+235 to +250**, meaning bookmakers think they’ve got a **30-33%** shot. The spread is **Dolphins -4.5 (-110)** and **Warriors +4.5 (-110)**, while the total is locked at **45.5 points**, with **Over/Under odds hovering around -110**.

Why does this matter? Well, the Dolphins’ low implied probability suggests they’re seen as a near-lock to win *and* cover the 4.5-point spread. The total line of 45.5 is a bit of a toss-up, but with both teams averaging over 20 points per game this season, the **Over** feels like a safer bet than your ex’s new dating profile.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Hamstring That’s Seen Better Days

The **Warriors** are missing **Demitric Vaimauga** (knee injury), replaced by **Tanner Stowers-Smith**. Vaimauga’s absence is like losing your favorite coffee mug—annoying, but maybe you’ll find a replacement. Meanwhile, the **Dolphins** gain **Kodi Nikorima**, their playmaker, returning from a hamstring injury. Nikorima’s return is akin to a superhero emerging from a cave after a nap—suddenly, the Dolphins have a brain on the field.

# Best Protective Table Covers 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Protective table covers are an essential investment for anyone looking to preserve the beauty and integrity of their tables. Protecting against spills,scratches,heat damage,and general wear and tear is crucial whether it's a cherished antique dining table,a brand new coffee table,or a work surface. The market offers a wide array of options, from clear vinyl to padded fabric, each designed with specific needs and aesthetic preferences in mind. This guide will explore some of the best protective table covers available in 2025, offering detailed reviews and a extensive buying guide to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

the best protective table covers offer a blend of durability, aesthetic appeal, and ease of maintenance.Understanding the key features will help you choose a product that meets your specific requirements.

**Material Composition:** The material used in a table cover is a primary determinant of its protective capabilities and longevity. Pvc vinyl, as a notable exmaple, offers excellent water resistance and is easy to clean, while polyester blends can provide a softer feel and greater heat resistance. The gauge or thickness of the material also plays a meaningful role; thicker gauges provide better protection against heavy impacts and sharp objects.the type of material dictates durability and ease of cleaning. Pvc vinyl is waterproof and easy to wipe, but can be less heat-resistant and eco-unfriendly. thicker options, like 3mm pvc, are better for protecting against scratches and dents. Polyester blends, especially those treated with water-repellent coatings, offer a more textile feel and better heat resistance but might require more delicate cleaning or stain treatment.**Size and Shape Options:** A well-fitting table cover is essential for both protection and aesthetics. The best brands offer a wide range of sizes and shapes, including rectangular, square, round, and oval options. Custom sizing is also a valuable feature, allowing you to order a cover specifically tailored to the dimensions of your table. Overhang length is another crucial consideration; a standard overhang is typically between 6 to 12 inches.

The Availability of various sizes and shapes ensures comprehensive coverage. Standard sizes like 60x84 inches for rectangular tables and 48 inches for round tables are usually readily available. However,custom sizing options are crucial for irregularly shaped tables or those with non-standard dimensions. The ability to specify overhang lengths also ensures a tailored fit that complements the table's design.

**Heat Resistance:** Protecting your table from hot dishes and cookware is a major concern. table covers with high heat resistance can prevent unsightly burn marks and other heat-related damage. Look for products that specifically state their maximum heat resistance temperature, ideally above 170°f (77°c). Materials like quilted cotton or specially treated polyester are good choices for heat resistance.

Heat resistance levels can range from limited to high depending on the material and construction. Pvc vinyl typically offers limited heat resistance (up to approximately 150°f or 66°c), making it unsuitable for direct contact with hot serving dishes. Polyester blends, especially when layered or quilted, can withstand higher temperatures, frequently enough up to 200°f or 93°c.**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** A table cover's ease of cleaning directly affects its long-term usability and appearance. Products that are waterproof and stain-resistant are the easiest to maintain; spills can simply be wiped away with a damp cloth. Machine-washable covers are also a convenient option for more thorough cleaning.

Maintenance is a consideration. Vinyl covers are easily wiped clean and offer great stain resistance but can feel less elegant. Polyester and fabric blends may require spot cleaning or machine washing, depending on the stain. Water repellency in fabric keeps spills from setting, allowing an easy clean. Opt for covers that can be machine washed.

**Non-Slip Backing:** One of the most frustrating issues with table covers is slippage. A non-slip backing helps to keep the cover securely in place, preventing it from sliding around during use. Materials like felt, rubber, or specialized grip coatings are commonly used for non-slip backings.

Having a non-slip backing solves a real world problem. A common nuisance with table covers is their tendency to slide, especially on smooth table surfaces. non-slip backings made of materials like felt or rubber create friction, locking the cover in place and preventing it from shifting during meals or activities.

## Core benefits

Protective table covers offer several key benefits, safeguarding tables from damage and enhancing their aesthetic appeal. Their utility extends beyond mere protection, contributing substantially to the overall dining or workspace surroundings.

**Preservation of Table's Surface:** The primary benefit of a protective table cover is its ability to shield your table's surface from damage. Scratches from utensils, spills from drinks, and heat from dishes can all leave lasting marks. A good table cover creates a physical barrier, preserving the table's finish and preventing costly repairs or replacements.

Many tables take a beating and need to be preserved.high-quality covers prevent scratches and dents with durable material. They repel moisture from drinks and food,keeping rings and stains away. Heat-resistant options defend against burns.

**Enhanced aesthetic Appeal:** while protection is paramount, table covers can also enhance the aesthetic appeal of your table. Available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and textures, they can complement your existing decor and add a touch of style to your dining or workspace.A well-chosen table cover can transform a plain table into a focal point of the room.

Table covers are more than just protection, they are a design element. Choose covers that match the decor and add a touch of style thru colors and patterns. This can make even a basic table stand out.

**Simplified Cleaning and Maintenance:** Cleaning up after meals or projects becomes much easier with a protective table cover. Spills and messes can simply be wiped away,preventing them from soaking into the table's surface. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for cleaning, allowing you to enjoy your space without worrying about potential stains or damage.

Simplify your cleaning routine with a protective cover. Spills and messes won’t soak into the table. Wipe it all away,saving time and effort.

**Extended Table Lifespan:** By protecting your table from damage and wear, a table cover can significantly extend its lifespan. Scratches, stains, and heat damage can all degrade a table's finish and structural integrity over time. A protective cover acts as a shield, preventing these issues and ensuring that your table remains in good condition for years to come.

Extending lifespan is a strong motivator for users. Protective covers prevent damage and wear.This keeps tables in good condition, saving the cost of replacements and repairs.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common customer questions can help to ease concerns and instill confidence in a product. Here are some frequently asked questions about protective table covers:

**Are protective table covers safe for use on delicate wood finishes?**
Yes, however, it is advisable to use a breathable underlayment, such as a felt pad, beneath the cover to prevent moisture buildup. Direct contact between vinyl covers and wood for extended periods can sometimes trap moisture, possibly damaging the finish. Using a breathable layer mitigates this risk.**how do I choose the right size table cover for my table?**
Measure the length and width of your table carefully. For rectangular tables,add an additional 12-24 inches to both measurements to allow for a 6-12 inch overhang on each side. For round tables, measure the diameter and add 12-24 inches for the overhang. If you are unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and choose a slightly larger size, as it can be easily trimmed or adjusted.**Can I use a protective table cover outdoors?**
While some table covers are designed for outdoor use, it's essential to choose one that is specifically labeled as waterproof and uv-resistant. Outdoor covers are typically made from durable materials that can withstand exposure to the elements,such as sunlight,rain,and wind. Regular cleaning is also recommended to prevent the buildup of dirt and debris.

**How do I remove wrinkles or creases from a new protective table cover?**
Most wrinkles and creases will naturally disappear over time as the cover settles. However, if you want to expedite the process, you can try using a hairdryer on a low setting to gently warm the cover, or you can lay the cover flat in a warm room. avoid using an iron, as the heat can damage the material.

Togawa Sakiko will die in ten minutes.

 

\*Actually something flashing before my eyes after watching Mujika.

\*There's a lot of personal interpretation here. Honestly, at this point I don't even know how to understand them anymore.

\*The whole piece is over 2,000 characters (In Chinese) . I wanted to write more, but too tired to do that.

 

  Togawa Sakiko lay on the bed in the mansion, staring blankly.

  The band, her studies, her family...... she counted items on to-do list out one by one on her fingers. At the time she'd gotten carried away, saying things like “I will become god myself.” But once she calmed down, she realized she had put herself on a pedestal. Her schedule was packed to the brim. She mocked herself—what kind of god is this busy? When she got to the seventeenth item on her to-do list, a floating electronic screen suddenly appeared before her eyes.

 

  “You will die in ten minutes.”

 

  Togawa Sakiko froze. The screen flickered, then shrank into a small countdown clock in the bottom-right corner of her vision, quietly ticking away.

 

  In ten seconds, Sakiko thought about a series of questions: when the Sophon arrived on Earth, whether she was dreaming right now—no, she’d just had coffee half an hour ago, there was no way she was asleep—and what her schedule was for tomorrow—no, there wouldn’t even be a tomorrow...... The numbers kept dwindling down, eye-searing despite sitting quietly in the corner. Anyway, she decided she should at least get up and see what she could do.

 

  She sat up. For once, she couldn’t decide what to do next. After all, who makes a schedule based on having only ten minutes left to live?

 

  She glanced at the time—9 minutes 30 seconds. Not even ten minutes, and still ticking down.

 

  So Sakiko got up and got dressed. Strictly speaking, someone with only minutes left in their life had no reason to worry about clothes. But she figured the act of dressing would buy her mind a buffer, so as not to freeze up on the spot.

 

  She thought of a visual novel game she had once tried on someone’s recommendation. Sakiko liked to think of herself as busy, but not so busy that she had to live off energy drink. She still made time to sit in cafés and savor a cup of black tea. Even the drummer who pushed herself to the brink still had ten days to live, so why did she only get—she glanced at the clock again—8 minutes 57 seconds left?

 

  She didn’t even have time to be lost.

 

  What kind of god dies this quickly?

 

  Sakiko remembered the last song the protagonist composed in that game. But that wasn’t possible for her. If she could compose an entire song in nine minutes, the Togawa family would have already packaged her and launched her debut as a one-of-a-kind prodigy. How could the keyboardist for Crychic and Ave Mujica have ever existed? Still, after putting on her coat, she went to check the piano room. The massive grand piano sat silently there, black and white keys lined up in order, awaiting another lyrical or fiery performance.

 

  But its owner had no such leisure now. If she started playing Chopin right this moment, she’d probably collapse mid-piece onto the leather seat.

 

  And yet she sat down. Her fingers fell on the keys, unleashing an improvisation more violent and chaotic than ever before. In the past—or even just yesterday—she would have jotted the melody down, wondering if she could weave it into a new song, and later make fans marvel at an live: “Is keyboardist of Ave Mujica even human?”

 

  But now this not-quite-human keyboardist’s hands blurred across the keys, the music pouring out with all her chaos, confusion, frustration, and rage. Everything in sight twisted and distorted—except that tiny countdown, glowing faintly, as if mocking mortals’ arrogance, daring to compare themselves to gods while being so small.

 

  When the last note fell, Sakiko rose. Her fingertips still buzzed with the heat and faint numbness of furious playing. 5 minutes 40 seconds left—the improvisation had taken three minutes, a third of her remaining life. Music had always claimed most of her existence, as was only natural, and she embraced it willingly.

 

  Sakiko prepared to leave. Instinctively, she reached for her house keys, then paused, taking only the ornate doll from her room. A beautiful puppet and a beautiful doll, both collapse onto the street, like the tragic, lovely endings of fairy tales.

 

  It was still early spring, and the air had not yet warmed. The icy night wind rushed against her, catching her off guard. She wondered why she hadn’t worn a scarf, but all she could do was tug at her collar, fending off the cold as best she could. The wind slipped through every gap anyway, freezing her to the bone. Finally, she gave up resisting, cradling the doll in her arms as she walked forward, allowing the wind to kiss every inch of the god’s skin with reverence.

 

  It wasn’t that late; the city’s colorful nightlife was just beginning. Sakiko wandered aimlessly. She could have chosen a destination—RING, KTV, a café, or someone to visit. But limiting herself to places reachable in five minutes, she had no real choices. It was as though invisible threads had been snipped, cutting her ties to any people and places alike. In her last five minutes, Sakiko felt with brutal clarity how isolated and estranged her existence truly was.

 

  The streets were lively. Groups of students crowded around food stalls, like that cheerful pink-haired guitarist from Mygo. A mother bent down to soothe her crying child, and for some reason Sakiko thought of Soyo as a teammate. In a corner store, notebooks with rhinoceros beetles and penguin-themed bandages were on sale. A fashion boutique displayed a Nyamu collab line on its door. A young man walked past with a golden retriever, and Sakiko suddenly wanted to laugh—it reminded her of her band’s vocalist somehow. The world was slowly becoming familiar again in her eyes. Memories and longings flowed back into her, shaping a more complete and real Sakiko. A sour ache rose in her chest, and she blinked. The countdown had less than a minute. Taking a deep breath, she sprinted toward the riverside.

 

  Compared to the crowded streets, the riverside was quiet. People stared in surprise at the blue-haired girl running past. Sakiko no longer looked down at her feet, but lifted her head to the vast night sky. Tonight’s heavens were extraordinarily clear, with only a few stars glittering like ornaments. She instantly recognized the bright Summer Triangle. Perhaps it was fate—this shining triangle was not visible only in summer, so even in her final countdown, she could still see such brilliance. Vega and Altair gazed at one another across the Milky Way, surrounded by stars. Through a layer of tears, the galaxy shimmered, blurred, dreamlike. She remembered summer nights of her childhood—the endless chorus of insects, the cool and dry wind, the skies she had gazed at since long ago. She had always been a child as bright as a primary star, and now she would return to those constellations.

 

  The countdown ticked its last seconds. Memories flew past like film reels. The cold wind dried her tears, reddened her ears peeking through her hair. Sakiko suddenly felt a freedom she’d never known before. Her soul and body fused perfectly; everything she felt was wholly herself. The numbers hit the single digits. From beyond, the other shore extended a solemn invitation to the god among mortals.

 

  Sakiko ran with all her strength.

 

  Three.

  Two.

  One.

 

  She heard the entire world fall silent, except for her heart pounding violently in her chest.

1meqdui,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1meqdui/aitah_for_telling_my_ex_to_clothe_his_son/,AITAH for telling my ex to clothe his son??,"A little background I (f32) have a 14 year old son with my ex partner, we will call him Drew (m39). I fell pregnant, we moved in together, I had our son, that lasted 6 weeks before I was diagnosed with PPD. He would leave all day and during one argument we ended things and less than 24 hours later I’d moved home with my parents for support. They helped me raise my son, his dad was in and out of his life. I went to solicitors to try and help get some form of consistent arrangement, mediation, but nothing helped.

He then got into a new relationship pretty quickly with Anna (F?) and they found out they were pregnant. Came crying to me telling me how was he going to love a baby he didn’t want, but they made it work. They were together for 11 years and it was a nightmare for anyone around them, fall outs every other week. Infidelity is believed to be a part of it. She never included my son in their family, never included in holidays, wouldn’t wish him goodnight when he was small or tuck him in. There is a lot more but to put it simply, wasn’t a parent figure to him whilst he was on contact with his dad. It got to a point where I told Drew that our son would not be left alone with Anna, after a small argument it was agreed. 

Throughout the years there had been numerous arguments about different things, trying to navigate as co-parents. But the major arguments all came around money, me asking for support and him telling me that he wouldn’t or couldn’t, mostly just point blank refusing to help. I left it at that and just struggled by. I always supported him, during breakups with Anna, always there with a listening ear and a coffee. 

Me and my fiance Gary (m37) got together when our kids were a year old. He has a daughter from a previous relationship and the kids are about the same age. He has took on my son as his own and I his daughter. 

Getting to the story Drew broke up with Anna 2 year ago and immediately got with Frankie (f35?) it came out that they had met during Drew’s relationship with Anna and had a deep connection so both broke it off with their current relationships, Drew left Anna and Frankie left her husband Dave. I was brought into the middle of it when Drew came to speak to me about it all and asked me if our son Paul could still have visitation with him on a weekend when he moved in with Frankie. I told him that our son was mature enough to tell me if he didn’t feel comfortable with someone around him and until that happened I didn’t have a problem. They quickly moved in together and that is where shit hit the fan.
Anna and Dave created a friendship and went on coffee dates and concocted a plan to break them up. Not going into too much detail but police were involved, it was NFA’d and CPS. I was their biggest supporter, I talked them through the processes because I knew a little about it because of my job. 
During all of this Anna had stopped Drew from seeing their daughter and he was going through the courts system to get visits with her, I supported and offered to write a letter to the court about his abilities as a father and our co-parenting relationship to help him.
It was then my son Paul’s 13th birthday and we all went out to celebrate with both sides of the family there, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins. It was a wonderful night, things started to improve from there. Paul was included in family events, trips to Frankie’s parents house during school holidays. They were invited to my parents house with their kids for barbecues, we went on days out all together, all the kids were so happy. 
Drew and Frankie had a baby together, we visited them in the hospital and I was the first outside of Frankie and Drew to hold the baby, I took gifts and Drew’s mother and Frankie’s daughter with Paul. Co-parenting seemed to finally be working. 

My son is neurodivergent and had yearly appointments, this is to see his doctors and make changes to his medication if needed. Paul asked Drew to come to the appointment and he promised he would. He has only been to 1 appointment in the past. Fast forwards until appointment day and as me and Paul drive to the appointment he calls his dad (45 minutes before the appointment) (note, there have been a lot of promises broken int he past) and asked him if he is coming to the appointment. Drew seemed flustered and asked Paul to call him back. He did get around 10 minutes (35 minutes until appointment) and let him know that Frankie’s daughter had a school trip
And he needed to take them to the school as Frankie doesn’t drive. Paul let him know that it was fine, but looked disappointed. (Drew lived a 20 minute drive from the appointment, remember this for later)

The day after I sent Drew a message and asked if he could get Paul some shirts for school at the weekend, Drew agreed. Within 24 hours I get a message from Drew claiming that he would get the sizing for the shirts with Paul and send me the sizes so I could order them online. This annoyed me because it wasn’t a big ask and I rarely ask for anything from him. He does pay child support monthly just to clarify but it isn’t a great amount. 

Then shit hit the fan, I text Drew and asked to speak with him over the phone. I get a message back letting me know that he had been to the doctors and was given medication for anxiety and he didn’t want to speak about money, Paul or Frankie. There isn’t much else we could talk about. 
Anyway the conversation happened. During it I let him know how he had upset Paul not turning up for him (he had done it numerous times in the past) I let him know that it seemed like Paul was at the bottom of his list of priorities, he made excuses about why he couldn’t make the appointment, didn’t put it in his diary, had the trip, wouldn’t of been able to get there on time anyways, 20 minute drive in 35 minutes… seems possible to me. We then spoke about the shirts and this is where it gets touchy, money. I let him know that it wasn’t the money that was the issues, it was him spending some time with his son and was also to help me out as I couldn’t figure out the sizing as he is in men’s shirts. Things escalated and Frankie in the background said little things like, we have 5 kids, that’s what the maintenance is for all of his needs, we don’t have loyalties to you just Paul, we only have to deal with Paul anyway. Then I was compared to Anna, so I told him to go fuxk himself and hung up.
This is where I might be TA, I sent a message that I would no longer be providing anything to them for Paul’s visits to them. Paul usually packs a bag with his clothes etc for a weekend or trips away. Everything from socks to PJ’s to daytime clothes. I informed him that I would send medication and anything he would like to bring for the weekend, but that would be it. I then blocked them.

A few days passed and I unblocked Drew and sent a message asking for an adult conversation, I received a message back that he didn’t want a conversation but then listed everything about or previous chat and how wrong I was etc. I responded letting him know that I stand by what I had said etc. no reply.

A few days ago I seen Drew’s mother and explained the argument and fall out. She let me know that she would speak to him. The next day I get a message from Drew, saying how me telling ‘someone’ he had heard through the grapevine and it was me belittling him blah blah blah. I responded letting him know that if he felt belittled then that was on him. I would be mortified if my child expected me to not show up for him and again that I stand by what I said and I will not be providing him clothes that I have bought for Paul as he receives a reduction on his maintenance for the 2 nights he stays there. Then I get a response from Frankie, letting me know that Drew can’t deal with this right now and him missing one appointment was an international disaster, that I if I don’t provide clothes then he will not be going with them on the trip they have planned in a few weeks time to her parents house as they can’t afford to get him a whole new wardrobe and even if they did he wouldn’t get the wear out of them as he isn’t there often enough to. Then another message about having Paul every weekend.

I responded letting her know that it was their choice to not include Paul and I had previously sent items for him because we were co-parenting. That will not be the case moving forward as I was not willing to have everything I had done for them thrown back in my face to then back down. Also Paul has only just been provided a bed at their home a few month ago and was sleeping on a sofa before that. I let them know that Paul was staying at their house and not living there on weekends and there is a big difference.

We take all the kids on holiday and provide everything they need regardless of where they live during the week, my step daughter lives at our house on a weekend and during the holidays and doesn’t need to pack a bag every weekend or for holidays from stuff her mother has bought.

1meqazz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitMalaga/comments/1meqazz/comiccon_san_diego_málaga_whats_really_going_on/,Comic-Con San Diego Málaga: What’s really going on behind the hype?,"So, Málaga is about to host something called **“San Diego Comic-Con Málaga”** this September (25–28, 2025). Sounds epic, right? A mini San Diego by the Mediterranean, cosplay everywhere, Jim Lee sketching Batman while you eat espetos… Except, hold on, because this story has more twists than a Marvel multiverse plotline.

# It’s Comic-Con… but not that Comic-Con

Here’s the deal: the event isn’t actually run by the famous **Comic-Con International** folks from San Diego. Nope. It’s organized by a Spanish company called **Cosmic Legends Productions**, created barely nine months ago with €9,000 of capital. They bought a license to use the name in Spain—so yes, it’s legally branded, but no, it’s not the same team behind Hall H. Think of it like buying the rights to call your bar “Starbucks”… but still serving instant coffee.

# FACUA steps in: “No snacks for you!”

Consumer group **FACUA** filed a formal complaint because the organizers banned attendees from bringing food or drinks inside. That’s right: no sandwiches, no water bottles. Their argument? It’s abusive for a cultural event that isn’t a restaurant. The organizers replied with a classic “there’s food inside and you can leave and re-enter,” but honestly, who wants to leave Comic-Con to hunt down a bocadillo halfway through a panel?

# Big promises: 60,000 fans and 300 hours of geek heaven

Despite the drama, the city is backing it hard. The government even gave it “exceptional public interest” status (translation: tax perks). They expect **60,000 attendees**, almost **300 hours of content**, panels, cosplay contests, K-dance shows, merch stands, and guests like **Jim Lee (DC)**, **Peach Momoko (Marvel)**, and cosplayer **Yaya Han**. They even have Lucas Vidal composing an original soundtrack for the event. Sounds like a Netflix trailer waiting to happen.

# But fans are skeptical

And here’s the kicker: loads of people feel misled. Many thought they were getting the real San Diego experience, not a licensed spin-off run by a new local company. Twitter, Reddit, and forums are buzzing with words like “cash grab” and “rebranding scam.” Is it fair? Maybe not entirely—it’s legal and officially approved—but it’s clear the marketing has blurred some lines.

# My two cents

Málaga’s Comic-Con could be amazing—it has the backing, the guests, and the buzz. But right now, it’s walking a fine line between hype and controversy. If they nail the execution (and maybe let people bring their own sandwiches), it could put Málaga on the global geek map. If not? Well… we might be adding it to the “Spain’s Fyre Festival” meme list by October.

Would I go? Honestly, yes. Worst case, you get to see Jim Lee doodle Batman while you eat overpriced nachos. Best case, Málaga becomes Europe’s nerd capital for four glorious days. Either way, it’ll be *memorable*.",1,1754034285.0,VisitMalaga,0,1.0,False

# Best Japanese Mug 2025: Review & Buying Guide

The allure of Japanese craftsmanship extends far beyond technology and fashion; it deeply permeates everyday objects, elevating them to forms of art. Among these, the Japanese mug stands out as a testament to both functionality and aesthetic beauty. These mugs, often handcrafted, are more than just vessels for beverages; they are tactile experiences, cultural touchstones, and reflections of a refined aesthetic sensibility. For discerning buyers in 2025,understanding the nuances of Japanese mug design,materials,and craftsmanship is crucial to selecting the perfect piece. This guide provides an in-depth review of the best Japanese mugs available, considering factors such as artistry, durability, and overall user experience.

## Key Features Analysis

The best Japanese mugs distinguish themselves through a combination of traditional techniques and modern innovation. These features contribute to both the aesthetic appeal and functional performance of the mug.

**Traditional Firing Techniques:** Many Japanese mugs are created using traditional pottery firing methods such as Raku, Bizen, or Shino. Each technique imparts unique characteristics to the clay, including variations in color, texture, and glaze.

The Raku firing process, for example, involves removing the pottery from the kiln at a high temperature and rapidly cooling it, creating unpredictable and often stunning visual patterns. bizen ware, known for its earthy tones and lack of glaze, derives its beauty from the natural interaction of the clay and the kiln's fire. Shino glazes are celebrated for their creamy,white hues and textured surfaces,often exhibiting small pinholes and cracks known as ""yuzuhada,"" or orange peel skin.

**Handcrafted Detailing:** A hallmark of high-quality Japanese mugs is the meticulous handcrafted detailing that goes into each piece. This can include hand-painted designs, sculpted handles, or carefully applied glazes.

Artisans spend years perfecting their techniques, ensuring that every detail contributes to the overall harmony and balance of the design. Hand-painted motifs often depict scenes from nature, traditional patterns, or abstract designs, adding a personal and artistic touch to the mug. Sculpted handles are ergonomically designed for comfort and ease of use, while meticulously applied glazes enhance the visual depth and tactile feel of the pottery.

**Material Quality (Clay Type):** The type of clay used significantly impacts the durability, heat retention, and overall feel of a Japanese mug. Different regions of Japan are known for their unique clay deposits,each with distinct properties.

For example, Banko ware, originating from Yokkaichi, is prized for its heat resistance and durability, making it ideal for stovetop use. Mino ware, from Gifu Prefecture, encompasses a wide variety of styles, each utilizing locally sourced clay known for its versatility. High-quality clay ensures that the mug can withstand repeated use,retain heat effectively,and remain free from harmful chemicals or toxins.

**Ergonomic Design & Functionality:** Beyond aesthetics,the best Japanese mugs prioritize ergonomic design and functionality. The shape of the mug, the size and placement of the handle, and the thickness of the rim all contribute to the overall drinking experience.A well-designed mug should feel pleasant and balanced in the hand, allowing for a secure grip and effortless pouring.

Features such as wide bases for stability and tight-fitting lids for heat retention can also enhance functionality.

I've had a few recommendations for spots near me (north Dublin) but I'm trying to find a spot maybe south Dublin or around the m50. My friend is coming from Graystones so I'd love to find a place a bit closer so it's in-between us and nobody has to do a big long drive.

I'm looking for a place where you can let the kids down to be free and safe. Ideally where parents can access the area and supervise the kids but shouldn't necessarily need to and can sit and have a coffee. A spot suitable for a 1YO (the 8 month might be too small and thats ok)
 I've been to spots (many many years ago) with friends that were basically cafés/community centres with a 10x10m area just for kids but can't for the life of me remember where they were.

Any recommendations would be great. Ideally not too expensive (or free!), doesn't need to be fancy and not requiring a minder. Just a spot to let the kids playindoors while we sit, chat, have coffee and keep them in the corner of the eye. If you know anywhere that is good but different to my preferences I'd still love to hear about them

Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions. ",2,1754033972.0,ParentingIE,0,1.0,False

Just because I blacklisted his first love's hair salon, my boyfriend actually sent me—five months pregnant—on a hiking trip to the remote Cascade wilderness.


For a whole decade, Cassian Kemnis treated me with warmth and patience—always the perfect boyfriend.


Until he took me to his first love—Melody Merouin's hair salon for a haircut.


His precious ex deliberately destroyed the long hair I'd been growing for eighteen years.


My modeling agency blacklisted her salon to protect me from further damage.


Never expected my own devoted boyfriend would ditch me in the freaking Cascade wilderness.


After I barely made it back—exhausted, scared out of my mind—I heard him cracking up with his buddies.


""Come on, it was just a little lesson. Does she seriously think she's hot shit or something? Girl's knocked up with no ring—who the hell else is gonna want her dirty bitch besides me?""


I didn’t cry, just scheduled an abortion appointment instead.


Cassian Kemnis, we're done!


...


""Look at her—she's all bloated now, and her own family's cutting ties with her. And she still had the nerve to mess with Melody? Big fucking deal—just lost a bit of hair and pay some damn penalty fees. You don't screw with Melody. This is what happens.""


I stood frozen in the doorway, listening to Cassian's words, my whole body shaking.


Seven days. It took me seven whole goddamn days to get out of those mountains, filthy and soaked to the bone.


Up until this exact moment, I'd been holding onto desperate hope—praying my own boyfriend wasn't the one who dumped me in that hellish place.


""Dude, aren’t you afraid she’ll call off the wedding if she finds out?"" his buddy asked.


Cassian snorted.


""Doesn't matter if she knows or not. I'm all she's got. Nobody else would want her used-up bitch now. Besides, she's crazy in love with me. Pathetic.""


His words cut through me like knives, ripping my heart to shreds.


He was so confident I'd never leave him.


I forced a bitter smile and stumbled to the corner store to borrow their phone.


""Hello, Dad? It's me, Aurora.""


An irritated voice came through the speaker.


""You still have the nerve to call? I threw all your fucking stuff in the dumpster outside. Go dig through it yourself and don’t ever contact me. You're a fucking disgrace whore.""


Before I could say another word, he hung up.


Cassian was right. Nobody wanted me anymore.


Even my own father had given up on me.


Ten years ago, Cassian saved me on that snowy mountain when I was ready to end it all. Gave me a second chance at life.


He said I had the most beautiful eyes.


Later I realized it was because they looked exactly like Melody's.


He'd been looking right through me at his percious ex this whole time.


I walked out into the rain and stumbled barefoot into the hospital.


""Hi, I need to schedule an abortion. As soon as possible.""


After a full examination, the doctor shook his head.


""Ma'am, you're severely malnourished and weak. Your uterine wall is dangerously thin, and at twenty weeks... if we do this procedure, you'll might never have children again.""


My face went pale, my hands trembling.


""Please do it.""


I couldn't even take care of myself right now—how could I be so selfish as to bring a child into this nightmare?


The surgery was scheduled for next week.


I dragged myself home, looking like hell.


""Jesus Christ, Aurora, you look like hell. Can't you just stay put when you're pregnant? Always gotta cause drama.""


Cassian's voice was mocking. His friends were cracking up behind him.


Ten years of Oscar-worthy performances. Ten years of my love down the drain.


I ignored them, just headed upstairs to the bedroom.


Funny how that oversized wedding portrait of us looking so in love is still hanging above the bed, like nothing ever happened.""


Right. I'd almost forgotten—our wedding was only in a month away.


Just another chance for him to humiliate me, wasn't it?


Timing it perfectly for when I'd really start showing.


Let everyone see the knocked-up bride.


I checked my phone. My agent had managed to push back the three million I owed in penalties.


Now I felt nothing but bitterness.


This was it. Game over.


That night, Cassian spooned me from behind, his hand on my belly.


""You and our little one are okay... right?""


Chapter 2


""Yeah.""


I closed my eyes, my voice flat as hell.


Cassian's hand jerked away like I'd slapped him. My coldness clearly caught him off guard.


""Cassian... do you actually love me?""


He didn't even hesitate.


""Of course I do.""


Right on cue, his phone started buzzing.


I could hear her crying through the speaker.


""Cassian, I had that nightmare again where you abandon me. I'm so scared. Please don't marry her, don't leave me, please...""


His voice turned all soft and urgent.


""Hey, hey, Melody, it's okay. That's never gonna happen. I'm coming over right now.""


After he hung up, he glanced back at me.


""Aurora, quit the drama. I told you I'd marry you, and I meant it. Just take care of yourself and the baby.""


Maybe dumping me in the mountains was finally eating at him, because suddenly he was pretending to give a shit about me.


Then he was out the door, running to her like always.


To him, I'd never be anything more than Melody's cheap stand-in.


I got up and looked at all our old photos around the room.


Funny thing—ever since Melody came back, we hadn't taken a single picture together.


At 3 AM, Melody posted on Instagram.


Photos of Cassian driving all over the city at midnight hunting for her favorite macarons.


A video of him making her pasta from scratch in her kitchen.


Shit he'd never done for me. Not once in ten years.


Cassian always told me to ""be more understanding.""


And I never asked for anything.


Turns out he didn't want someone understanding—he just didn't want me.


I grabbed every photo of us and ripped them to shreds, cutting up my hands in the process.


Just like all the little wounds Cassian thought didn't count.


Next morning, I ripped down every wedding decoration in the house.


Keys jingled in the lock.


Melody walked in like she owned the place.


""God, Aurora, look at you. What makes you think you can compete with me?""


Straight to the point. I had to give her that.


But I'm not surprised at her here at all. ""What do you want, Melody?""


My voice was ice.


""Aw honey, if it bothers you, I won't move in. I just thought you could use some help. Cassian's worried sick about you.""


Suddenly she was all sweet and concerned.


Which meant Cassian was about to show up.


Her sharp nails dug right into my belly.


I pushed her hands away, protecting my baby on instinct.


Melody let out this dramatic scream and threw herself backward, slamming her head into the corner of the coffee table.


Blood started trickling down her face.


""Melody!""


Cassian dropped his suitcases and rushed to her side.


""I'm fine, Cassian. Aurora's just... pregnancy hormones, you know? Don't be mad at her—I shouldn't have surprised her like that.""


Her eyes filled with tears, blood and mascara running down her cheeks.


""What the fuck, Aurora? You keep attacking Melody for no goddamn reason. What is your problem?""


Cassian pointed at me like I was some kind of monster.


""Cassian, don't blame Aurora, okay? I'm sure she didn't mean it. Let’s just be thankful she’s safe.""


Melody tugged on his sleeve, playing the perfect victim.


""Please, stop with the constant doubts. If I really did hook up with Melody, do you honestly think you could compete with her? Look at yourself—Jesus, fat as hell.""


Chapter 3


I didn't say a word to defend myself against Cassian's accusations.


In the past, I would've been crying and begging for forgiveness by now.


Not anymore. Not ever again.


After a long silence, Cassian looked confused by my coldness.


He couldn't figure out why I wasn't breaking down like usual.


""You done? I'm tired.""


I turned and walked back to the bedroom. No explanations, no drama, no fear of anyone leaving.


That night, Cassian slipped into bed and pulled me close.


""Aurora, I'm exhausted, okay? Just... be good and stop picking fights with Melody. Our wedding's in a month, and I'll give you everything I promised, alright?""


He buried his face in my hair, his hand gently rubbing my belly.


""Mm-hmm.""


My voice was dead flat.


I don't want the wedding. I don't want the baby. I don't want anything that has to do with you anymore.


Keep your fucking promises yourself.


The next day, Cassian dragged me and Melody to hang out with his friends.


He said I'd be ""more comfortable"" in the back seat.


I closed my eyes and listened to him and Melody laugh and flirt in the front.


All their inside jokes, their shared history. None of it included me.


At the bar, it was the usual crowd—Cassian's asshole buddies.


All of them were Team Melody.


""Damn, the wife and the mistress, side by side like besties! Man, talk about living the dream!"" His buddy teased.


""Oh my god, don't say that! Aurora's carrying his baby—I could never compete with that! Cassian and I are just friends!""


Melody covered her face, all fake-bashful.


""Cut it out, guys.""


Cassian barely tried to shut them down.


""Aurora, sit here.""


He pulled out my chair, then immediately did the same for Melody.


When the server started pouring drinks, Cassian grabbed his wrist before he could fill Melody's glass.


""Skip her—she gets all red and gross when she drinks.""


I stared at my own glass, already filled to the top, and almost laughed.


Didn't give a damn to his pregrent fiancée, but another woman. Guess Cassian did love her.


Someone suggested playing spin the bottle with truth or dare.


First spin landed on Melody.


They dared her to play the pocky game with someone.


She covered her face like she was so embarrassed, then pointed at Cassian all shy.


""Cassian, would you... help me out?""


He glanced at me, saw my blank expression and shrugged.


""Yeah, whatever.""


Everyone lost their minds cheering as their faces got closer and closer.


The whole table went crazy while I just sat there quietly rub my belly.


Like everyone forgot I was supposed to be Kevin's fiancée.


After they finished the cookie, Cassian's ears were bright red.


""Bro, it's honestly tragic you two never hooked up. I always thought you'd end up together—you're like, soulmates or whatever. Plus all that crazy shit you used to do for Melody in college? Good times.""


Cassian shot him a warning look and the guy finally shut up.


Then he grabbed my hand.


""Aurora, they're just messing around. Don't take it seriously.""


I smiled at him like I couldn't care less.


""It's fine. Doesn't bother me.""


Cassian looked satisfied with my reaction.


Then the bottle spun again.


This time it pointed at me.


I looked around the table. They all had this excited, predatory look.


""Ooh, how about pregnant mama does her best kangaroo impression? She's already got the pouch going, and that hair's looking pretty wild—just hop around a bit!""


I looked straight at Cassian.


He didn't stop them or think there was anything wrong with his friends humiliating his pregnant fiancée.


He was totally used to it.


Because this wasn't the first time anyway.


I used to think taking their dirty shit was my ticket into his world.


It took me way too long to realize some circles aren't worth joining—especially when they make it crystal clear you're not wanted.

This morning, at coffee, we were discussing housing in our area.

She queried me about new housing in the area, and I reiterated what I had learned from others and using terminology that I had learned from my family.

## Key Features Analysis

The best furniture stencils of 2025 are distinguished by several key features that contribute to their usability, durability, and overall effectiveness.**Material Quality**

The material used to create the stencil significantly impacts its lifespan and ease of use. High-quality stencils are typically made from durable, flexible materials like Mylar.Mylar is known for its resistance to tearing,bending,and solvents,making it ideal for repeated use with various paints and finishes. Thicker Mylar stencils also provide greater stability during application, reducing the risk of paint bleeding or smudging. Other materials, such as acetate or vinyl, might potentially be suitable for single-use projects or intricate designs but generally lack the longevity and versatility of Mylar. The best stencils are precisely cut for clean lines and sharp details, ensuring a professional-looking finish every time.

**Design Variety**

A wide range of design options is essential for catering to diverse tastes and decorating styles. The availability of different patterns, sizes, and themes allows users to find the perfect stencil to complement their existing furniture and decor.

From classic damask and geometric patterns to modern floral and tribal designs, the best stencil collections offer something for every project. Modular stencils, which can be combined and repeated to create larger patterns, provide even greater flexibility and customization. Look for stencils that include registration marks or alignment guides to ensure seamless pattern continuity when tiling or repeating designs. A comprehensive collection should also include border stencils, corner stencils, and individual motifs for accenting specific areas of furniture.

**Ease of Use**

User-friendly features are crucial for ensuring a successful stenciling experience, especially for beginners. Stencils with clear markings, helpful registration systems, and manageable sizes are easier to handle and position accurately.

Self-adhesive stencils that gently adhere to the furniture surface can prevent slippage and reduce the risk of paint bleeding. However, removable adhesive options are preferable to prevent damage during stencil removal. Stencils with large, open areas may be easier to fill in, while those with intricate details require more precision and patience. Clear instructions and online tutorials can also be invaluable resources for mastering stenciling techniques and achieving professional results.

**Reusability and Cleanability**

The best furniture stencils are designed for repeated use,allowing you to tackle multiple projects without needing to replace them constantly. Durable materials and proper care are essential for maximizing the lifespan of your stencils.

Mylar stencils are particularly well-suited for reuse, as they can be easily cleaned with soap and water or solvent-based cleaners, depending on the type of paint used. proper cleaning immediately after each use prevents paint buildup, which can distort the stencil's design and affect future applications. Storing stencils flat or rolled up prevents them from bending or creasing, ensuring they maintain their shape and integrity over time. The ability to reuse stencils not only saves money but also reduces waste, making them a more sustainable choice for DIY enthusiasts.

The cost savings associated with stenciling can be meaningful, representing a fraction of the expense of purchasing new furniture. Plus, stenciling allows for upcycling older or second-hand furniture, giving them a new lease on life and reducing waste.

**Creative Expression and Relaxation**

Stenciling can be a therapeutic and fulfilling activity, allowing individuals to unleash their creativity and destress from daily life. The process of carefully applying paint and watching a design come to life can be incredibly satisfying.

Many find stenciling to be a meditative practice that fosters focus and relaxation.

## FAQs Section

**Are furniture stencils suitable for beginners?**
Yes, furniture stencils are generally beginner-friendly.The basic technique is straightforward, involving securing the stencil to the furniture surface and applying paint with a brush, roller, or sponge.

Success depends on careful preparation, proper stencil placement, and using the appropriate amount of paint to prevent bleeding or smudging.Many online tutorials and guides offer step-by-step instructions and helpful tips for beginners. It’s recommended to start with simple designs and smaller projects to gain confidence and refine your technique before tackling more complex patterns.

**What types of paint are best for stenciling furniture?**
Several types of paint work well for stenciling furniture, depending on the desired finish and the type of furniture material.

Acrylic paints are a popular choice due to their fast-drying time, durability, and wide range of colors. Chalk paints offer a matte finish and are easy to distress for a vintage look. Milk paints provide a similar aesthetic to chalk paints and are eco-friendly. For furniture that will be exposed to moisture or heavy use, consider using a durable enamel paint or sealing the stenciled design with a clear protective finish. Always test the paint on an inconspicuous area of the furniture before stenciling to ensure proper adhesion and colour compatibility.

**How do I prevent paint from bleeding under the stencil?**
Preventing paint bleed is crucial for achieving a clean, professional-looking stenciled design.

One of the most effective techniques is to use a ""dry brush"" approach, which involves using very little paint on your brush or roller and building up the color gradually. This reduces the risk of paint seeping under the stencil edges. Securing the stencil firmly to the furniture surface with painter's tape or repositionable spray adhesive can also help prevent movement and paint bleed. Using a stencil brush with stiff bristles to stipple the paint onto the surface can help to fill in the design without pushing paint underneath the stencil.

**How do you clean furniture stencils?**
Cleaning stencils immediately after use is essential for preserving their quality and extending their lifespan.

The cleaning method depends on the type of paint used. Water-based paints, such as acrylics and latex, can be easily cleaned with warm water and mild soap.Oil-based paints and varnishes require solvent-based cleaners, such as mineral spirits or paint thinner. Gently scrub the stencil with a soft brush or cloth to remove any paint residue, being careful not to bend or damage the stencil's delicate details. Rinse thoroughly and allow the stencil to air dry completely before storing it flat or rolled up to prevent warping or creasing.

It was kind of mixed signals from him, but I was willing to settle as a friend and wasn't asking for much.  
  
Anyhow one time he got sick, and I got worried so I gave him oranges via Kakao Gift. He said ""Oh you didn't have to,"" and I was like ""No, it's okay, just take them, I am not asking for anything in return."" He then said, ""Oh, I know a good chicken place nearby our neighborhood so maybe next week, we can have dinner - my treat."" And I was like, ""Oh okay, no need to treat me, but sure no problem!"" 

And then a few weeks passed, no mention of the supposed-to-be dinner. I then assumed that it was one of those ""polite"" expressions Koreans used to say, and I didn't bother asking him about it again. Then, a couple of weeks after, he suddenly sent me a picture of chicken coupon, with the caption ""I'm sorry but I'd probably be busy working out a lot so here's a chicken coupon, please enjoy it."" And I was like, ""No no, it's okay, I wasn't asking for anything in return; it's yours and you can use it by yourself."" 

Then he replied, ""Actually, I just got it from somewhere else, so it's okay, just use it."" At that point, I got mad, and told him, ""I'm not charity, I don't need coupons you got from somewhere else and toss it to me with the excuse that you can't have dinner with me."" I felt at this point that basically, he didn't treat me even as a friend cuz (1) the following day, they had chicken in the lab for dinner, meaning if he wanted to, he could've had dinner with me but obvi, he didn't want to, (2) if you're really sorry, it didn't have to be chicken, but at least use your own money to buy me even just a cup of coffee. Sending me a coupon you got from somewhere else just felt like you didn't wanna spend both TIME and MONEY with me.

  I was the halfling.  
  
  It had been me—it had always been me. And Ren—oh my God—Ren was here to find and kill me, because the prince of the mother freaking Otherworld was free in the mortal realm. The Prince was here to knock up a halfling, to make an apocalypse baby . . . with me.  
  
  Me.  
  
  I was going to vomit.  
  
  Like all over the hardwood floors of my bedroom.  
  
  I was having trouble breathing as I lifted my gaze. “Why? Why didn’t you tell me?”  
  
  Tink’s gossamer wings fluttered silently as he drifted closer. The damn brownie. The damn brownie I’d found in Saint Louis Cemetery. The brownie I’d made a Popsicle leg brace for and whose torn wing I had carefully wrapped gauze around. The damn brownie I let live in my apartment for the last two and a half years and hadn’t killed yet for spending a fortune of my money on Amazon like he belonged on an episode of Hoarders. The damn brownie was about to get punt kicked into another dimension.  
  
  He clasped his hands together in front of his shirt, which was covered with powdered sugar. Sprinkles of white covered his face like he’d face-planted into a pile of coke.  
  
  “I didn’t think it would ever come to this,” he said.  
  
  I lifted my hand, feeling wet warmth cascade down my arm. “Well, it did come to this, like right now.”  
  
  Tink floated to the left. “I thought we’d closed all the gates, Ivy. We had no idea there was a second gate here. We believed that there was no chance of any of the royal court or the prince or princess coming through. It was a non-issue.”  
  
  Lowering my hand, I shook my head. “Guess what, Tink. It’s not a non-issue. It’s a huge, Godzilla-sized issue!”  
  
  “I can see that now.” He flew over to the bed and landed on my comforter. “I never meant to lie to you.”  
  
  I frowned as I turned around. “I hate to break it to you, Tink, but if you don’t mean to lie to someone, you simply don’t lie to them.”  
  
  “I knooow.” He drew the word out as he walked to the edge of the bed, his bare feet digging into the purple, chenille bedspread and most likely spreading powdered sugar everywhere. “But you wouldn’t have believed me if I had told you, would you? Not like I had a thorn stake lying around.”  
  
  Okay. He had a point there. “But when I first brought it up to you, you could’ve said something.”  
  
  Tink lowered his chin.  
  
  I took a deep breath. “Did you know what I was when you saw me?”  
  
  “Yes,” he said, and continued in a rush, “but it wasn’t on purpose. You finding me was a fluke. A coincidence. Or it was fate. I like to think it was our destiny.”  
  
  “You can stop there.” It hurt, knowing that he hadn’t been upfront with me this entire time, and it burned deep in my gut and chest. I didn’t know who he was.  
  
  I didn’t know who I was anymore.  
  
  “I didn’t know until you got near and I sensed the weak fae blood in you. But you’re right. I should’ve told you, Ivy-divy. You’re right, but I was afraid . . . I was afraid of what you’d do.” Tink suddenly threw himself backward onto the bedspread, little arms and legs spread out. “I didn’t want to upset you, because you helped me out, and I didn’t want you to do something rash if I did tell you.”  
  
  “What could I have done?” A ball of emotion knotted in my throat. “What can I do?”  
  
  He raised limp noodle arms. “You could’ve, I don’t know, hurt yourself.”  
  
  My mouth dropped open, causing me to wince as the bruised and swollen skin along the left side of my face pulled taut. Hurt myself? I looked down at the thorn stake lying on the floor. “No,” I whispered, bending down and picking up the stake. Using my shirt, I wiped the blood off the tip. “I don’t want to die.”  
  
  “That’s good to hear.” Tink was sitting up, arms still at his sides.  
  
  I placed the stake on the dresser, next to my iron ones and the daggers. “I wouldn’t hurt myself, Tink.”  
  
  “But you would try to leave.” Tink was closer, in the air behind me.  
  
  I drew in a deep breath that did nothing to help me. Leave? Was that the next course of action? I stepped away from the dresser, avoiding Tink, which was harder than it should’ve been for someone that was only the size of a Barbie doll. Weary to the core, I walked to the edge of the bed and sat down. The weariness wasn’t just due to the numerous injuries that were slowly healing.  
  
  My thoughts were spinning too fast. I closed my eyes and eased onto my back, letting my legs dangle off the bed as panic sliced through my belly. The very idea of leaving had my heart jumping all over the place. Leaving New Orleans meant leaving the Order, and that was huge. One simply couldn’t just up and leave the Order. It was tantamount to going AWOL from the military. There’d be APB put out on me. Other Order members would be on the lookout, and there were sects in every state. I’d only be able to hide for so long. If I up and left, David would suspect I was a traitor like . . . like Val, and he’d contact other sect leaders. But it was more than my duty to the Order that made me hesitant to leave—way more.  
  
  Hell, my duty to the Order dictated that I turn myself over to them, and it wasn’t even that. For the first time in my life, the sudden reluctance to do the right thing had nothing to do with my duty.  
  
  It had everything to do with Ren.  
  
  Leaving meant walking away from him, and the mere thought of doing that caused my heart to end up somewhere down near my dangling feet. I loved him. God, I loved him more than I loved pralines and beignets, and that was hardcore, because my love of sugary, sweet things rivaled the most epic love stories known to man. Thinking of never seeing him again made me want to curl into a ball, and that would be incredibly stupid, because I’m pretty sure, with my busted ribs, it would hurt like hell.  
  
  I should’ve never gotten close to him.  
  
  This whole entire time I’d been petrified that he’d die on me like everyone else had. Never once had it crossed my mind that I’d lose him because I would have to walk away. Or run away, fast.  
  
  But what could I do? There was no way I could let the prince carry out his plans. A child created from a union of the prince and a halfling would literally throw open all the doors to the Otherworld. They would stay permanently open, and all the fae would come through. Mankind would turn into an all-you-can-eat fae buffet.  
  
  “You’re thinking it now,” Tink announced.  
  
  I was thinking a lot of things right now.  
  
  He landed on my bent knee, and the only reason why I didn’t throw him off me was because I was sure I’d end up hurting myself more in the process. “You think the only thing you can do is leave, but that won’t help you. You’re forgetting something very important. Actually, you’re forgetting two very important things.” He paused. “Come to think of it, you’re probably forgetting a lot, because you got your head knocked—”  
  
  “Tink,” I warned.  
  
  He stomped up my leg, which felt like a cat was walking on me. “You have to consent.”  
  
  I pried my eyes open. The left one was still pretty swollen, so Tink was a blurry form where he stood by my hip.  
  
  He cupped his hands around his mouth. “Sex. Consent to sex with the prince. That’s the only way a child can be conceived. No glamour. No magic or compulsion. No tricks. You know, you have to actually want—“  
  
  “I know what consent to sex means,” I snapped.  
  
  “Apparently, you don’t.” Tink jumped off my hip and landed on the bed next to me. “Because he can’t make you do it. Well, he co  
uld make you, and that’s just gross and wrong and not completely out of character for the prince, but a child won’t be conceived.”  
  
  “Oh, great to know. He could force himself on me, but hey, at least there’s no apocalypse baby. No harm, no foul.”  
  
  Tink’s little nose scrunched. “You know that’s not what I meant.” He lifted himself up in the air and flew so he was directly above my head. “But there’s a bigger problem, Ivy.”  
  
  I laughed, and it sounded a little crazed. Not even drunken crazed. More like hitting the asylum crazed. “What could be worse than me being a halfling?” Panic lit up my chest. Just saying that out loud made me want to vomit.  
  
  “You said the prince tasted your blood, right?” Tink asked. “After you two fought?”  
  
  My nose wrinkled. “Yeah. I mean, I’m pretty sure he did after he . . . smelled me.”  
  
  “Then there is nowhere you can go that he cannot find you.”  
  
  I opened my mouth, closed it, and then tried again. “Come again?”  
  
  Tink zipped down to the bedspread. “He will be able to sense you anywhere. It doesn’t matter if you went to Zimbabwe, and I’m not even sure where Zimbabwe is, but I just like saying Zimbabwe, but he’d find you eventually, because you’re now a part of him.”  
  
  I couldn’t even think for a moment, couldn’t even form a coherent thought that did not involve what in the actual fuck. “Are you for real?”  
  
  Tink nodded and plopped down cross-legged beside my arm. He lowered his voice as if he’d be overheard. “When an ancient, like the prince, takes a part of someone into them, he is forever connected to that person. You’re bonded, in a way.”  
  
  “Oh my God.” Unable to deal, I placed my hands over my face. A new horror surfaced. “Then he knows where I am right now?”  
  
  “Most definitely.”  
  
  “And he’ll know everywhere I go.” Holy crap, I couldn’t even process the implications. My mere presence would be putting everyone in danger. But what I didn’t understand was, if the prince could sniff me out like some kind of halfling bloodhound, then why hadn’t he showed yet? It had been a week since we fought. What was he waiting for?  
  
  “It’s really creepy, isn’t it?” Tink said.  
  
  Creepy wasn’t even the word for it. I couldn’t think of an appropriate word for all of that. “Do you know how to kill him?”  
  
  “You kill him like you would kill any ancient. You cut off his head, but that’s not going to be easy.”  
  
  No shit. Taking out normal fae wasn’t particularly easy. Stabbing them with an iron stake only sent them back to the Otherworld. Chopping off their heads killed them.  
  
  “But that’s not the most important thing.” Tink grabbed my right hand. My wrist had stopped throbbing, another sure sign that the prince had truly patched up some of the damage he’d inflicted upon me. I eyed the brownie. “You cannot let anyone know what you are.”  
  
  “Gee. Really? I was thinking about updating my Facebook to halfling status.”  
  
  He cocked his blondish-white head to the side. “You don’t have a Facebook, Ivy.”  
  
  I sighed.  
  
  Tink continued, because of course. “I looked for you. Wanted to add you as my friend so I could poke you, and I know people don’t poke anymore, but I think poking is a great way to express how one—”  
  
  “I know I can’t tell anyone, but what’s stopping the fae from outing me?” I asked.  
  
  “The fae will know if you’re outed, because the Order would kill you.” He said this like we were talking about Harry Potter, and not about me, you know, being put down like a rabid dog. “The prince won’t want to risk that, even if there are other female halflings out there. He won’t want to risk the time it would take to find another one.”  
  
  “Well, I guess that’s one good thing,” I said dryly.  
  
  He let go of my hand. “You can’t even tell Ren. Especially not him.”  
  
  My gaze shifted to Tink.  
  
  “I know what he is. I overheard you two talking the morning you left to guard the gate. He’s an Elite, and while I think that is as lame of a name as the Order, I’ve heard of them.”  
  
  “How have you heard of them?”  
  
  He buzzed down until he was standing next to my head. He bent over, whispering in my ear, “I’m omnipresent.”  
  
  “What?” I frowned at him. “That doesn’t even make sense.”  
  
  He straightened. “It makes perfect sense.”  
  
  “I think you mean omniscient.”  
  
  He glanced up at the ceiling. “Huh.”  
  
  “You’re not omniscient,” I told him, and then said, “Are you?”  
  
  Tink grinned devilishly. “No.”  
  
  Annoyance flared. “I need you to be up front with me. No more lies. No more bullshit, Tink. I’m serious. I need to be able to trust you, and I’m not sure I do right now.”  
  
  His eyes widened slightly and then he dropped down to his knees. “I deserve that.”  
  
  Yeah, he did, because I took him in and he’d lied to me a lot. It didn’t matter that he had good reasons. He’d still lied.  
  
  And then it hit me like a smack in the face. I was going to have to do the same thing. Lie for a good reason to Ren and to . . . to everyone, so I was really no better.  
  
  “I know about the ancients, because I lived in the Otherworld. We had to learn everything about them to survive,” he said. “The prince and the princess, and the king and queen, are the most powerful, but there has always been talk of the Elite. Many fae have fallen to them when they used to come and go into this realm as they pleased, before the gateways were closed.”  
  
  That sounded believable. I guessed.  
  
  Tink screwed up his face. “Though I am surprised to hear that Ren is one. He doesn’t seem smart or cool enough for that level of badassery.”  
  
  “Ren is cool and awesome enough,” I corrected Tink. “He’s a total badass.”  
  
  “Whatever.” He folded his arms across his chest. “We’re going to have to agree to disagree. Moving on. You cannot tell him. It is his duty to end you.”  
  
  My breath caught.  
  
  Like it had been his duty to allow his best friend Noah to walk away, knowing that it would be the last time he’d see him. God, Ren had even said he couldn’t go through that again, and I couldn’t do that to him. I couldn’t put that kind of knowledge on him.  
  
  “I won’t,” I whispered.  
  
  Tink nudged my arm with his foot. “You have to pull it together, Ivy. Like right now.”  
  
  I looked over at him. “I think I’m owed a pity party for the next couple of minutes.”  
  
  “Save your tears for the pillow.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and shook my head. “This isn’t an episode of Dance Moms.”  
  
  But Tink was right. Not like I was going to tell him that, especially when I was still considering doing minor bodily harm to him. I needed to pull it together. I had no other choice. Leaving wasn’t an option. I controlled the whole baby-making aspect and there was no way I was willingly going to knock boots with that freak. I needed to get it together, because the only choice I had now was to stop the prince.  
  
  Stop the prince and make sure no that one, including Ren, found out what I was. I shivered. A question floated through my crowded thoughts, pushing everything out of my mind.  
  
  “I don’t get it.”  
  
  “What?” Tink asked.  
  
  “How . . . how am I a halfling?” I stared at the ceiling. “I don’t remember my parents, but Ren said he checked into them. He said they were in love. How could this have happened?”  
  
  Tink didn’t answer.  
  
  He didn’t know. Probably no one would ever know the truth. Anything was possible. My mother might’ve slept with a fae. Or maybe it was like Noah’s father. He’d met a fae woman and had gotten her pregnant before he met the woman he ended up marrying. I just couldn’t imagine how anyone who knew what the fae were could knowingly sleep with one.  
  
  I exhaled shakily and thought that maybe I would expel all my tears onto my pillow. I sort of just wanted to roll over and let it all ou  
t. Actually, I honestly didn’t want to think about any of it, but that was impossible.  
  
  “You need to let him go,” Tink said quietly.  
  
  I turned my head to him. “What?”  
Ren. You need to let him go. Push him away. Break up with him. Whatever. You need to get as far away from him as possible.”  
  
  I stiffened and my response was immediate. “No.”  
  
  “Ivy—”  
  
  “No,” I repeated, waving my left hand. “End of discussion.”  
  
  Tink stared at me mutinously, but he shut up. I knew that letting Ren go and pushing him away would be the smart and right thing to do in case things went south, but I couldn’t bring myself to even consider that. That probably said really bad things about me.  
  
  Okay. It definitely said really bad things about me.  
  
  But I had just found Ren. I’d fallen underwater, completely over my head, for him, with him, and I couldn’t do it. I was too selfish. He was . . . he was mine, and I’d be damned if I lost that too due to things completely out of my control. It wasn’t fair. I . . . I deserved him.  
  
  “Fine,” Tink muttered finally.  
  
  Lying there for a few moments, I gathered what remained of my composure like it was a tattered blanket, wrapped it around me, and sat up, wincing. “I need to shower.”  
  
  “Thank Queen Mab!” Tink buzzed to the foot of the bed, giving me room. “You were starting to get a bit rank.”  
  
  I shot him a dark look as I rose.  
  
  “And your hair looks like I could cook French fries in it.” He twirled in the air and what was left of the powdered sugar hit my face. “It’s that greasy.”  
  
  My shoulders slumped as I shuffled to the bathroom. “Thanks,” I said, pushing open the door.  
  
  Suddenly Tink was right in front of my face, causing me to jerk back. “I know you’re mad at me and you probably want to slice and dice me up and wear my skin as a new bracelet.”  
  
  I glanced around. “Um. That’s not exactly what I want to do.”  
  
  Hope widened his eyes.  
  
  “But I kind of want to flush you down a toilet,” I amended.  
  
  He gasped. “I’d get stuck! And these pipes are old. How would you even do that? I’m not a goldfish.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes.  
  
  Tink swayed and then shot forward, placing his tiny hands on my cheeks. “I’m sorry.”  
  
  Blinking, I tried to remember if Tink had ever apologized for anything. Not even when he knocked my laptop off the balcony when he’d decided he wanted to watch Harry Potter outside. Or when he caught the stove on fire and then tried to put it out with my favorite blanket. Or when he . . . Well, there were a lot of examples of when he should’ve apologized but hadn’t.  
  
  “You might not believe this, but I didn’t stay with you because of what you are.” His pale Otherworld eyes met mine. “I stayed because I like you, Ivy. I stayed because I care about you.”  
  
  Oh gosh.  
  
  My lips parted, and that messy knot of emotion ballooned in my throat. I wanted to cry again. I was such a mess, a hot and stinky mess.  
  
  Tink grinned and his eyes glimmered. “And, okay, I also stayed because you have the magical and wonderful Amazon Prime.”  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Exhausted physically, mentally, and most definitely emotionally, all I managed to do was pull on a pair of pajama bottoms and a tank top after my much-needed shower. There was no way I was going to have the energy or even the desire to dry the mass of wet curls on my head, so I twisted them up and shoved a thick bobby pin into my hair.  
  
  I roamed back out into the living room around eleven. The entire time I was showering I fought down a hot mess of emotion and locked it away and threw away the key. Well, to be honest, I probably only lost the key to the Pandora’s box level of emotional breakdown, but I stayed in that shower until I was confident I could handle everything.  
  
  I had to handle this.  
  
  I walked into the kitchen, noticing that Tink’s bedroom door was cracked open and the room was dark inside, but I doubted he was actually asleep. Stomach grumbling, I headed for the carryout container Ren had showed up with earlier. Mentally crossing my fingers, I flicked open the lid and sighed.  
  
  There was one beignet left.  
  
  One.  
  
  Shooting Tink’s door a glare, I snatched a paper towel off the counter and scooped up the piece of sugary heaven. Then I grabbed a root beer out of the fridge and the can of Pringles out of the cupboard.  
  
  Healthy eating at its finest, but I figured I deserved it.  
  
  Back in the living room, I eased down on the couch and turned on the TV. Settling on a show about child geniuses, I did the whole hand to mouth thing, getting more sugar and potato-chip crumbs on my chest than in my mouth while I got way too engrossed in the TV. I was equally fascinated by how incredibly smart these kids were, and somewhat shamed because I had no idea what the capital of Tajikistan was when a ten year old did.  
  
  I must’ve dozed off, because the next thing I knew I felt the soft brush of fingertips coasting down the right side of my face. My eyes flickered open, and the first thing I saw was a powerful forearm covered with vines shaded in deep green. I followed that tattoo up to a dark-colored sleeve, knowing it formed the most amazing design under the shirt, and over a sexy throat. I never knew throats could be sexy, but they could be. Oh yes, they could be.  
  
  Ren was sitting on the edge of the couch, and my heart did an unsteady flip as a horrible thought invaded my sleep-hazed consciousness. Would he be sitting here if he knew I was a halfling? I squeezed my eyes shut. Of course I knew the answer. He’d be as far away from me as humanly possible. Probably in a different time zone.  
  
  “Hey.” Ren’s deep voice was sex on a stick. Good sex, too. Perfect sex. Mind-blowing sex. It was smooth like chocolate and cultured. I really need to make my brain stop. “You okay?” he asked.  
  
  I cleared my throat. “Yeah,” I said, telling myself that I’d pulled it together earlier. I opened my eyes and saw that Ren was holding a Pringles can in his lap. “What are you doing with the chips?”  
  
  A dimple appeared in his left cheek. The boy had a set of dimples that were absolutely kissable. And lickable. Actually, Ren’s entire face was all that and a bag of beignets. His jaw was like marble. His cheekbones were broad and high, and his nose was slightly hooked, as if it had been broken at some point, which was highly possible considering our line of work. His lips were full and expressive, and those eyes of his were absolutely stunning. Thick, dark lashes framed irises so green they looked like emeralds freshly picked from a mine.  
  
  Ren was gorgeous, almost so attractive that he could compete against a fae in the looks department, and that was saying something, because the fae were extraordinarily beautiful in their glamoured and true forms—especially the latter. But Ren had them beat. Fae didn’t have an ounce of his warmth and humanity.  
  
  “Chips?” he said, laughing as he held them up. He shook it. “How about an empty can?”  
  
  I frowned. “I was hungry.”  
  
  “You were cuddling the empty can.” A wayward curl fell across his forehead.  
  
  My brows lifted. “Was not.”  
  
  “Was too. You were holding it to your chest like it was a treasured possession. I had to pry it from your fingers.”  
  
  “Well, I do like Pringles a lot.”  
  
  “I can tell.” He leaned over, placing the can on the coffee table. The other dimple appeared as he eyed my chest, and I got all warm and fuzzy. “You have sugar and crumbs all over you.”  
  
  Oh.  
  
  The warm and fuzzy vanished. “I was hungry and tired.”  
  
  Ren chuckled as he lowered his head, kissing the corner of my lip. Another wretched thought started to break free. Would he kiss me if he—I cut the thought off, and focused on a better one. I couldn’t wait until he could really kiss me again. A split lip sucked ass.  
  
  He lifted his head. “Did that ass save you any of the beignets?”  
  
  One of these days he might actually refer to Tink as something other than a body part. “One.”  
  
  He cursed under his breath. “And it looks like your chest ate most of it.”  
  
  “Thanks,” I muttered, shifting onto my side so he had more room. He scooted in, resting h  
is arm on the back of the couch as he angled his body toward mine. “What time is it?”  
  
  “A little after two in the morning.” His lashes lowered as he dragged his finger along the neckline of my tank top. I shivered. “The streets were dead. No sign of the prince or any of the warrior knights that came through the gates. Saw a fae, but he disappeared on me near Royal.”  
  
  I started to sit up, but his finger did another pass, this time skating down the center, between my breasts. It was hard to concentrate on important things when he was touching me, but I managed. “Something is going on. I don’t understand why they’d be lying low like this, especially after busting the prince free.”  
  
  “They’re probably trying to stay alive.” More fingers got involved as he coasted them carefully over my bruised side and still achy ribs. “After all, they’re probably focused on finding the halfling.”  
  
  My breath caught.  
  
  He moved his hand away as his eyes flew to mine. “Did I hurt you?”  
  
  “No.” I swallowed hard as I pushed up into a sitting position and leaned against the arm of the couch. I curled the palm I’d sliced open into a fist, hiding the wound. Though I was a mess all over, I doubted he’d notice it. “Did you see David tonight?”  
  
  His eyes searched my face. “Only for a bit at headquarters. He was busy getting the new members sorted.”  
  
  “How many did we get?” We’d lost sixteen the night the fae opened the gate to the Otherworld at the LaLaurie house—the night my best friend, my closest friend, had betrayed us.  
  
  “Five for now, I think.” He leaned over, resting his weight on his arm and his cheek against his fist. “He said that he’s trying to pull more in from Georgia or something. While he was in the middle of yelling at someone on the phone and yelling at the new members, he asked about you.”  
  
  Surprise hit me. “Really?”  
  
  He nodded. “Wants to know if you’re still planning to come in tomorrow. I told him I thought you could use a few more days.”  
  
  Twelve hours ago I would’ve pitched an absolute bitch fest at the suggestion, but after what I’d recently discovered, I wasn’t sure about returning tomorrow. “I don’t know if I’ll be . . . ready.”  
  
  “I think you need to take a couple more days.” He reached over with his free hand and picked up a dry curl. “David agrees. You’ve come a long way in a week, but sweetness, you . . .” He stopped as he stretched out the curl and then let it go. It snapped back into place. “You were hurt bad. I don’t want you on the street until you’re at a hundred percent.”  
  
  My gaze drifted to my closed hand. I wasn’t sure I’d be a hundred percent anytime soon. Physically? Yes. Everything else? Ha.  
  
  “Hey.” Two fingers curled under my chin and lifted my head. His eyes were bright and beautiful. “You sure you’re okay?”  
  
  I forced a smile. “Yeah, I’m just tired.” That wasn’t exactly a lie.  
  
  “Then let’s hit the bed.”  
  
  I didn’t protest as Ren rose and picked up my hand, gently hauling my butt off the couch. He led me toward the bedroom door and I glanced over my shoulder, expecting to see Tink peeking around the corner, but he was nowhere to be seen. I was surprised that he was missing a prime opportunity to annoy Ren.  
  
  I climbed into the bed and got settled on my side—because now I had my own side, the left side, and Ren had the right side since he’d been staying with me each night for the past week. I watched him strip down. It was a show I didn’t want to ever miss, no matter what was going on in my head or with my body.  
  
  Ren always started with his shirt, and he took it off in a way that I found fascinating. He reached behind him, grabbing the fabric at the nape of his neck and tugging it off over his head. I don’t know what it was about that, but it made all the lady bits stand up and take notice.  
  
  So did his abs and pecs.  
  
  Because our job required us to go toe to toe with a creature that could punt kick you like a football, we had to stay in shape, but I had a feeling that his flawless six-pack and defined chest had been some kind of gift from God. As were those amazing indents on either side of his lean hips. They were so perfect they were almost indecent.  
  
  Ren unhooked the band that circled his stomach, just below the chest, and got down to removing the daggers at his side. He placed them next to mine on the dresser. His and hers weapons were the way of romance in the Order. Then he kicked off his boots and two more stakes joined his stash. Then his socks came off.  
  
  His chin was bent as his hands dropped to his tactical pants. A button come undone and down went the zipper. I clutched the bedspread, and he lifted his gaze. “You like what you see, don’t you?” he asked as he shucked off his pants.  
  
  I nodded and then said, “Yes,” in case he doubted it.  
  
  A slow smile graced his lips. “I like you watching me.”  
  
  Ren sometimes went commando, and that was incredibly hot to think of. Today he had on tight black boxer briefs, and I could tell he really did like me watching. I could see the hard, thick ridge of that approval straining the material.  
  
  My stomach dipped as he picked up his clothes, folding them neatly and placing them on the chair by the door. Then he disappeared into the bathroom. We obviously hadn’t done anything of the fun and naughty nature since last Wednesday, and we only had sex that Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Before then, we’d messed around, and it had been wonderful, but we hadn’t spent a lot of time together. And before Ren, there had only been Shaun and the one time. A burst of sadness lit up my chest at the thought of the boy I’d loved and lost three years ago. The pain was still there, probably would always be there, but it was fading like I guessed . . . I guessed it was supposed to.  
  
  But now there was Ren, and I refused to lose him, too.  
  
  The bathroom door opened. Our relationship was still so new that a fine tremble coursed through my belly as he approached the bed.  
  
  “So, I’m wondering about something,” he said, stopping at his side.  
  
  I focused on his face. “What?”  
  
  “Why are you clutching the blanket like it’s going to run away from you?”  
  
  “Oh.” I let go of the blanket and scooted down onto my back. “I don’t know.”  
  
  A half-grin appeared as he slipped under the covers. He turned off the lamp and rolled over onto his side, facing me. “You’re really weird tonight.”  
  
  Oh dear. “No, I’m not.”  
  
  He carefully placed his arm over my hips and shifted so the front of his body was pressed against mine. I tipped my head back and turned toward him. I couldn’t make out his features at all since I kept heavy curtains on my windows. The room was pitch black, but I could feel his gaze.  
  
  And I could feel his hard length against my hip.  
  
  I couldn’t help it. I immediately thought of him in this bed, moving over me and in me. An ache blossomed between my thighs. I shifted, wiggling my hips, and Ren let out a deep, rumbling sound. I moved again.  
  
  His fingers splayed across my outer hip as he dipped his head, brushing his lips over my temple. “You moving like that is going to drive me crazy.”  
  
  My toes curled. “We could, you know, do something about it.”  
  
  He made that sound again, and I felt the tips of my breasts tingle. “Ivy, we’ve got to take things easy for a little bit.”  
  
  “What?” I whispered, turning onto my side. I placed my hands on his chest. In the darkness, he kissed my forehead. “Do you not . . . want to?”  
  
  The second I asked that question I wanted to kick myself in the face. What in the hell was wrong with me? I was a halfling. And admittedly, I was feeling a wee bit unsure about things, like, for example, should I even be coming onto him when I was this . . . this thing he was here to literally kill? Was I betraying him in a way, his—  
  
  “Babe, I want nothing more than to get between those legs with my hands, my mouth, and most definitely my dick, but I’m not going to risk hurting you.” His hand flexed along my hip. “So for right now, it’s me and my hand on my dick and thoughts of yo  
u naked underneath me, coming and screaming my name.”  
  
  My body flushed hot at the image of him touching himself. “That’s not helping.”  
  
  “Ditto.”  
  
  Easing onto my back, I exhaled softly and closed my eyes. His hand stayed on my hip as he settled back in against me. Several moments passed, and in that time, a hundred different things filled my thoughts. I pushed aside the whole halfling business, and almost  wished I hadn’t, because I started thinking about Val.

1meq10b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1meq10b/am_i_wrong_i_just_broke_up/,Am i wrong ... i just broke up,"This is the first real romantic relationship I’ve ever experienced, and I’m not sharing it to brag — far from it. It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that’s a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let’s begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there — she’s a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She’s kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone — very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I’m not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn’t think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive — I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She’s very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn’t an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual — and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn’t reply right away. Sometimes she’d disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn’t see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don’t judge me too quickly — just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay — but after I graduate. She also said I’m not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn’t reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story — so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn’t been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, “I would’ve sent you more if I knew you weren’t busy.”
(I know you’re probably thinking, “What a fool,” but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied — but calmly and distant.

Here’s something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her “close friends” and posted that same story again — but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn’t understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn’t ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment — her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together — cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts — everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, “Okay, give me 3 days and I’ll let you know — but only if you’re not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.”

Three days later, she said “okay” and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she’d say things like, “I don’t know how I feel toward you yet — maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.”

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were “just friends.”

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme — and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio — she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn’t ghost or block people. She said she doesn’t treat people like second options.

She hadn’t blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her — no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

“If silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.”

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I’m not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it’s me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me — but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid — even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

But honestly ... am is it was my fault or my bad ?? She just blocked me for soemyhing idid and maybe idont know and she tried to reach me but though am the one who cancelled on her ??




Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Edit: btw i tried to talk about girls in some place then she showed jealous idk if she were acting but she was playful jealousy

the fog came early that morning.  
soft.  
slow.  
like it didn’t want to bother anyone.

it crept between mailboxes  
and curled around porch lights—  
quiet enough to ignore  
if you weren’t looking for it.

by breakfast,  
it had swallowed the street whole.  
but nobody mentioned it.  
not even once.

mrs. eaves didn’t wave from her porch that day.  
her chair sat still—  
cushion damp, rocking slow  
like she’d just stepped inside.

by noon, the mail piled at her door.  
by dinner, someone had already parked in her spot.  
by night,  
no one said her name.

not missing.  
not taken.  
just  
gone.

i looked around,  
waiting for someone to say something.  
anything.

but the neighbors watered their plants  
like she hadn’t been on that porch  
every morning for fifteen years.

someone mowed their lawn.  
someone walked a dog that barked at shadows.  
someone waved at me like nothing was missing.

like nothing had ever been there  
at all.

the boy who used to race the school bus  
never passed by again.  
his chalk drawings on the sidewalk  
washed away in one night,  
like the rain knew  
he wasn’t coming back.

and the boy who rode his bike  
at exactly 5:12 a.m.—  
i remember the way his wheel always caught the storm drain,  
how his helmet never sat right,  
how his backpack bounced like he was always late.

i remember watching him  
every morning.  
but now the sidewalk holds no marks,  
and no one else remembers he was ever there.

i sat at the same booth i always did  
when the fog came in.  
the waitress poured my coffee without looking.  
didn’t ask for my order.  
didn’t ask how i was.

the place felt thinner.  
like something had scraped it clean  
and left just enough to keep it standing.

i asked if she remembered the woman  
who used to knit by the window.  
red yarn. crooked smile.  
“you might be thinking of someone else,” she said.  
but i wasn’t.

i started keeping a list.  
names. faces.  
where they sat.  
what they said.  
anything that proved they were real.

i taped photos to my wall—  
ones i found in drawers  
and boxes no one else opened.  
some had names written on the back.  
some just said: *“you.”*

every morning,  
i checked the list.  
every morning,  
a name or two would blur  
like the ink didn’t believe me anymore.

one morning,  
i woke up and couldn’t remember  
who sat at the corner table  
with the lucky coin.

i could see the outline.  
could hear the laugh  
in the empty air.  
but the name was gone.

not on the list.  
not in the photo.  
not even a ghost of a letter.

it felt like something had been  
gently removed from my memory  
while i slept.

and the worst part was—  
i didn’t know  
how many others i’d already lost.

the fog came heavier that day.  
didn’t curl or drift.  
it leaned.  
pressed against the windows  
like it wanted to see who was still here.

i stayed quiet.  
tried not to blink.  
tried not to move.  
but it already knew.

it whispered my name.  
not loud.  
not even close.  
but just enough  
to prove it had learned how to say it.

and for the first time,  
i realized—  
i hadn’t written it  
anywhere.

i tried to write it down.  
my name.  
just my name.

1mepx59,https://i.redd.it/bph865210dgf1.jpeg,Robloxia Police Department Personal Dossier: Harry Percant,"Name: Harry Percant
Birth Date: 5/15/200
Age: 25
Rank: Detective
Division: Major Crimes Unit
Clearance Level: Top Secret
Alias: “The Mind of Robloxia”
Status: Active
Special Assignment: High-Profile Criminal Investigations

Description:
Detective Harry Percant is widely regarded as the most brilliant mind within the Robloxia Police Department. Possessing an unparalleled talent for deductive reasoning, behavioral analysis, and forensic reconstruction, Percant has cracked over 1,200 complex cases—many of which were deemed unsolvable by veteran task forces.
‎
‎From murder mysteries and serial sabotage to cyber heists and disappearances, he often requires only a trace of evidence—a footprint, a hair, a misplaced word—to unravel an entire web of lies. His methods may appear unorthodox, but his results speak for themselves.
‎
‎To the public, he's a hero.
‎To criminals, a nightmare.
‎To his peers? A mystery wrapped in a trench coat.

Personality:
To his co-workers at the Robloxia Police Department, Harry Percant is a paradox in a trench coat. A relentless workaholic, he often drowns himself in case files, diagrams, and crime scene photos—sometimes going days without leaving the precinct. Long after others clock out, Harry remains hunched over his cluttered desk, surrounded by red-string boards and stacks of unsolved reports, driven by an obsession with truth few can understand.

Though undeniably brilliant, Harry is socially withdrawn. Small talk escapes him. He stumbles through greetings, avoids eye contact, and has a habit of deflecting conversations back to his current investigations. To some, it feels like he's more comfortable discussing autopsy reports than ordering coffee.

He’s respected for his results—but pitied for his isolation.",3,1754032791.0,RobloxAvatars,2,1.0,False

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant.     Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway...     Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!

Ever feel like you’re running on a hamster wheel? 🐹 You’re busy *all day*, but when you look back, it feels like you’ve accomplished...well, not much? Yeah, me too. 

For the longest time, I thought the key to productivity was to just *grind* harder. More hours, more tasks, more coffee! ☕ But guess what? That strategy left me feeling drained and totally unfulfilled. I felt like a productivity zombie, just going through the motions.

So, what changed? I discovered something I like to call **“reverse productivity.”** Crazy name, right? But it helped me reclaim **15+ hours** a week! Here’s how it works:

### 1. **Know Your Non-Negotiables**
   - Make a list of what truly matters. 
   - Is it your health? Family time? Hobbies? 
   - Focus your energy on these. Everything else? Let it go.

### 2. **Limit Your To-Do List**
   - Funny thing: I used to list 10-15 tasks daily. 😅
   - Now? It’s just **3 main tasks**. 
   - *Why?* Because less is more, my friends! 

### 3. **Time Chunking (Not Binge-Watching)**
   - Set a timer for focused work. I use the Pomodoro technique (25 mins work, 5 mins break). 🍅
   - You’d be amazed at how much you can get done in short bursts. Plus, the breaks keep your brain fresh!

### 4. **Embrace “No”**
   - It’s not a curse word! Saying “no” frees you up for what actually matters. 
   - Want to join that project? Maybe later. Can’t do coffee this week? Perfectly fine!

### 5. **Schedule Downtime Like It's Work**
   - Scheduled naps? Yes, please! 💤 Or dedicated “do nothing” time. 
   - Remember: Rest isn’t just for the weak; it’s for the *smart*.

🎉 Here’s the kicker: **I got my life back.** Just by flipping my approach on its head. Instead of pushing harder, I started pulling back and making space for what's truly meaningful. 

Have you ever tried something similar? Maybe you have tips of your own! I’d love to hear how you balance grinding with chill time. Let's get the convo rolling! 💬",1,1754032457.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Context: So, I once tried to court and date a woman back in 2017. At that time, she was like 18 and I was 26. At that time, we were actually already holding hands and even say ""I love you"" to each other and I even prepared amazing dishes (I LOVE cooking and making creative dishes) for her daily (she admits that she can't cook) for her snacks at university (she was still studying in college at the time) but our status is unclear because I never asked her out, but I did asked her if I can court her. I never got any response, but we still continued being affectionate towards each other. So this is more like ""MU""? But before the year 2017 can end, we lost contact with each other.

Fast forward to 2025 today, nearly a decade later, I messaged her and I didn't expect that she would respond 5 months later. We re-connected. And she's still that same woman I was attracted to before. One of the things I love about her is her amazing sense of humor - I'm well-known in my circle of friends to be the life of the party, the one who always cracks jokes and teases people for pure fun, but they love being around me because I can also take jokes, and at times, I even poke fun and insult myself. She's one of those women who can really take a joke and laugh at them, in other words, she doesn't take trivial things very seriously, so that's why we have amazing connection. Even though I know that we already have had our fair share of boyfriends/girlfriends as time passed, I'm prepared to try to date her again. Even though I'm dating multiple women at the same time, she's the one I have strong feelings for as we already knew each other way back.

She said recently that ""if ever I visit there, coffee us"". So of course, I accepted and told her ""Gladly. You and I have a date. I promise"", and she agreed and said ""See you soon"". However, this time, I want to make things clear with her. I want to make sure that we won't just be MU like before, I want to be serious with her for real. I'm pretty sure she already knows my intentions (I hope) since I tried to ask her out (or more like stated that I will court her once before) years ago. But, still... I personally think it's better to be sure.

Do you think it's a good idea for me to be honest and ask her out again and be straight-up to avoid any misunderstandings and possibly stringing each other along?

For context, I’ve been teaching for over 20 years and I’m currently in a small, lower-socioeconomic independent school teaching senior and middle years. I’m still pretty new so it’s been an uphill climb teaching in a very different school after years at my last school. 

I knew today was going to be a good day when it started with my Head of Faculty buying all the teachers in our faculty coffee and pastries (it’s the small things, you know?). Then, my year 8 English class had an exam where they all actually worked diligently for the whole lesson. Then while on PGD, I noticed many students (even ones I don’t teach) saying hello in the playground, making me feel like a welcome part of the place for the first time. Lastly, when something came up and I had to go slightly early, other teachers stepped in to cover me. 

I realise these might be all small moments, but they added up to a great day and the first where I really felt I was finding my feet since changing schools. There are good things about this job, I just have to be open to acknowledging them in amongst all the challenges.

  Sydney  
  
  I WOKE TO DARKNESS.  
  
  This was nothing new, as I’d been waking to darkness for the last … well, I didn’t know how many days. It could’ve been weeks or even months. I’d lost track of time in this small, cold cell, with only a rough stone floor for a bed. My captors kept me awake or asleep, at their discretion, with the help of some drug that made it impossible to count the days. For a while, I’d been certain they were slipping it to me in my food or water, so I’d gone on a hunger strike. The only thing that had accomplished was a forced feeding—something I never, ever wanted to experience again—and no escape from the drug. I’d finally realized they were piping it in through the ventilation system, and unlike with food, I couldn’t go on an air strike.  
  
  For a while, I’d had the fanciful idea that I’d track time with my menstrual cycle, the way that women in primitive societies synced themselves up to the moon. My captors, proponents of cleanliness and efficiency, had even provided feminine hygiene products for when the time came. That plan failed as well, though. Being abruptly cut off from birth control pills at the time of my capture reset all my hormones and spun my body into irregular cycles that made it impossible to measure anything, especially when combined with my wacky sleep schedule. The only thing I could be certain of was that I wasn’t pregnant, which was a huge relief. If I’d had Adrian’s child to worry about, the Alchemists would’ve had unlimited power over me. But it was just me in this body, and I could take whatever they threw at me. Hunger, cold. It didn’t matter. I refused to let them break me.  
  
  “Have you thought about your sins, Sydney?”  
  
  The metallic, female voice reverberated around the small cell, seeming to come from every direction at once. I pulled myself up into a sitting position, tugging my rough shift down over my knees. It was more out of habit than anything else. The sleeveless garment was so paper thin that it offered no warmth whatsoever. The only thing it provided was a psychological sense of modesty. They’d given it to me partway through my captivity, claiming it was a token of goodwill. In reality, I think the Alchemists just couldn’t handle keeping me there naked, especially when they saw it wasn’t getting to me the way they’d hoped.  
  
  “I slept,” I said, stifling a yawn. “No time to think.” The drug in the air seemed to keep me perpetually sleepy, but they were also sending in some stimulant that made sure I stayed awake when they wanted, no matter how exhausted I might be. The result was that I never felt fully rested—as was their intent. Psychological warfare worked best when the mind was weary.  
  
  “Did you dream?” the voice asked. “Did you dream of redemption? Did you dream of what it might be like to see the light again?”  
  
  “You know I didn’t.” I was being uncharacteristically talkative today. They asked me these questions all the time, and sometimes I just stayed silent. “But if you want to stop feeding me that sedative for a while, maybe I’ll get some real sleep and have some dreams that we can chat about.”  
  
  More importantly, getting real sleep that was free of these drugs meant that Adrian would be able to locate me in my dreams and help me find a way out of this hellhole.  
  
  Adrian.  
  
  His name alone had gotten me through many long, dark hours. Thoughts of him, of our past and of our future, were what had helped me survive my present. I often lost myself in daydreams, thinking back to the handful of months we’d had together. Had it really been so short? Nothing else in my nineteen years seemed as vivid or meaningful as the time I’d spent with him. My days were consumed with thoughts of him. I would replay each precious memory, the joyous and the heartbreaking, and when I’d exhausted them, I’d fantasize about the future. I’d live out all the possible scenarios we’d imagined for ourselves, all our silly “escape plans.”  
  
  Adrian.  
  
  He was the reason I was able to survive in this prison.  
  
  And he was also the reason I was here in the first place.  
  
  “You don’t need your subconscious to tell you what your conscious already knows,” the voice told me. “You are tainted and impure. Your soul is shrouded in darkness, and you have sinned against your own kind.”  
  
  I sighed at this old rhetoric and shifted, trying to make myself more comfortable, though it was a losing battle. My muscles had been in a perpetual state of stiffness for ages now. There was no comfort to be found in these conditions.  
  
  “It must make you sad,” the voice continued, “to know that you’ve broken your father’s heart.”  
  
  That was a new approach, one that caught me off guard enough that I spoke without thinking: “My father doesn’t have a heart.”  
  
  “He does, Sydney. He does.” Unless I was mistaken, the voice sounded a bit pleased at having drawn me out. “He greatly regrets the fall you’ve taken. Especially when you showed such promise to us and our fight against evil.”  
  
  I scooted over so that I could lean against the rough-cut wall. “Well, he’s got another daughter who’s much more promising now, so I’m sure he’ll get over it.”  
  
  “You broke her heart too. Both of them are more grieved than you could ever know. Wouldn’t it be nice to reconcile with them?”  
  
  “Are you offering me that chance?” I asked cautiously.  
  
  “We’ve been offering you that chance from the beginning, Sydney. Just say the words, and we will gladly begin your path to redemption.”  
  
  “You’re saying this hasn’t been part of it?”  
  
  “This has been part of the effort to help you cleanse your soul.”  
  
  “Right,” I said. “Helping me through starvation and humiliation.”  
  
  “Do you want to see your family or not? Wouldn’t it be nice to sit down and talk to them?”  
  
  I made no answer and instead tried to puzzle out what game was afoot. The voice had offered me many things in captivity, most of them creature comforts—warmth, a soft bed, real clothes. I’d been offered other rewards too, like the cross necklace Adrian had made for me and food far more substantial and appetizing than the gruel they currently kept me alive on. They’d even tried to tempt with that last one by piping in the aroma of coffee. Someone—possibly that family that cared so much about me—had tipped them off to my preferences.  
  
  But this … the chance to see and talk to people was a wh  
ole new thing altogether. Admittedly, Zoe and my dad weren’t exactly at the top of the list of whom I’d want to see right now, but it was the larger scope of what the Alchemists were offering that interested me: a life outside of this cell.  
  
  “What would I have to do?” I asked.  
  
  “What you’ve always known you had to do,” responded the voice. “Admit your guilt. Confess your sins, and say you’re ready to redeem yourself.”  
  
  I nearly said, I have nothing to confess. It was what I’d told them a hundred times before this. Maybe even a thousand times. But I was still intrigued. Meeting with other people meant that surely they’d have to turn off that poison in the air … right? And if I could escape that, I could dream. …  
  
  “I just say those words, and I get to see my family?”  
  
  The voice was irritatingly condescending. “Not right away, of course. It has to be earned. But you would be able to move on to the next stage of your healing.”  
  
  “Re-education,” I said.  
  
  “Your tone makes it sound like a bad thing,” said the voice. “We do it to help you.”  
  
  “No thanks,” I said. “I’m getting used to this place. Shame to leave it.”  
  
  That, and I knew re-education was where the real torture would begin. Sure, it might not be as physically challenging as this, but that was where they really honed in on the mind control. These harsh conditions were a setup, to make me feel weak and helpless so that I’d be susceptible to when they tried to alter my mind in re-education. So that I’d be grateful and thank them for it.  
  
  And yet, I couldn’t shake that thought again, that if I did leave here, I might be in a position to sleep and dream normally again. If I could make that contact with Adrian, everything might change. At the very least, I would know he was okay … if I survived re-education itself. I could make guesses at the kind of psychological manipulation they’d try on me but didn’t know for sure. Would I endure it? Could I keep my mind intact, or would they turn me against all my principles and loved ones? That was the risk of leaving this cell. I knew also that the Alchemists had drugs and tricks to make their commands “stick,” so to speak, and although I was probably protected against them, thanks to regular magic use before I’d been imprisoned, the fear that I might still be vulnerable nagged at me. The only certain way I knew to protect against their compulsion was through a potion I’d once made and successfully used on a friend—but not on myself.  
  
  Further ruminations were put on hold as I felt fatigue wash over me. Apparently, this conversation was over. I knew enough now not to fight and stretched out on the floor, letting thick, dreamless sleep wash over me, burying thoughts of freedom. But before the drug took me down, I said his name in my mind, using it as a touchstone to keep me strong.  
  
  Adrian …  
  
  I woke at an unspecified time later and found food in my cell. It was the usual gruel, some kind of boxed hot cereal that was probably fortified with vitamins and minerals to keep my health up, such as it was. Calling it “hot cereal” might have been generous, however. “Lukewarm” was more adequate. They had to make it as unappetizing as possible. Tasteless or not, I ate automatically, knowing I needed to keep my strength up for when I got out of here.  
  
  If I get out of here.  
  
  The traitorous thought reared up before I could stop it. It was a longtime fear that had nagged at my edges, the terrifying possibility that they might keep me here forever, that I would never see any of the people I loved again—not Adrian, not Eddie, not Jill, not any of them. I would never practice magic again. I would never read a book again. That last thought hit me particularly hard today because as much as daydreaming about Adrian carried me through these dark hours, I would’ve killed to have something as mundane as a trashy novel to read. I would’ve settled for a magazine or pamphlet. Anything that wasn’t darkness and that voice.  
  
  Be strong, I told myself. Be strong for yourself. Be strong for Adrian. Would he do any less for you?  
  
  No, he wouldn’t. Wherever he was, whether he was still in Palm Springs or had moved on, I knew Adrian would never give up on me, and I had to match that. I had to be ready for when we were together. I had to be ready for when we were reunited.  
  
  Centrum permanebit. The Latin words played through my mind, strengthening me. Translated, they meant “The center will hold” and were a play off a poem Adrian and I had read. We are the center now, I thought. And he and I will hold, no matter what.  
  
  I finished my meager meal and then attempted a cursory washing at the small sink in the cell’s corner, feeling my way in the dark to where it sat by a small toilet. A real bath or shower was out of the question (though they’d used that as bait before, too), and I had to clean myself daily (or what I thought was daily) with a rough washcloth and cold water that smelled of rust. It was humiliating, knowing they were watching with their night vision cameras, but it was still more dignified than staying dirty. I wouldn’t give them that satisfaction. I would stay human, even if that was the very charge they were questioning me on.  
  
  When I was clean enough, I curled back up against the wall, my teeth chattering as my wet skin shivered in the cold air. Would I ever be warm again?  
  
  “We spoke to your father and sister, Sydney,” said the voice. “They were so sad to hear that you didn’t want to see them. Zoe cried.”  
  
  Internally, I winced, regretting that I played along last time. The voice now thought this family tactic had some leverage over me. How could they think I’d want to bond with the people who’d locked me up here? The only family I might have wanted to see—my mom and my older sister—probably weren’t on the visitor list, especially if my dad had gotten his way in their divorce proceedings. That outcome actually was something I would’ve liked to hear about, but no way would I let on to that.  
  
  “Don’t you regret the pain you’ve caused them?” asked the voice.  
  
  “I think Zoe and Dad should regret the pain they caused me,” I snapped back.  
  
  “They didn’t want to cause you pain.” The voice was trying to be soothing, but mostly I wanted to punch whoever was behind it—and I wasn’t the kind of person usually given to violence. “They did what they did to help you. That’s all we’re trying to do. They’d love the chance to talk to you and explain themselves.”  
  
  “I’m sure they would,” I muttered. “If you even talked to them.” I hated myself for engaging with my captors. This was the most I’d spoken to them in a while. They had to be loving it.  
  
  “Zoe asked us if it would be okay if she brought you a skinny vanilla latte when she visits. We told her it would. We’re all for a civilized visit, for you to sit down and truly talk, so that your family and especially your soul can heal.”  
  
  My heart beat rapidly, and it had nothing to do with the lure of coffee. The voice was confirming again what had been suggested before. A real visit, sitting down, drinking coffee … that had to take place out of this cell. If any of this fantasy were even true, there was no way they’d bring my dad and Zoe here—not that seeing them was my goal. Getting out of here was. I still maintained that I could stay here forever, that I could take whatever they threw at me. And I could. But what was I accomplishing? All I proved was my own toughness and defiance, and while I was proud of those things, they weren’t getting me any closer to Adrian. To get to Adrian, to get the rest of my friends … I needed to dream. To dream, I needed to get away from this drugged existence.  
  
  And not just that. If I were somewhere that wasn’t a small, dark cell, I might be able to work magic again. I might have a clue about where in the world they’d taken me. I might be able to free myself.  
  
  But first I had to leave this cell. I’d thought I was brave staying here, but suddenly, I wondered if getting out was what would truly test my courage.  
  
  “Would you like that, Sydney?” Unless I was mistaken, there was an edge of excitement in the voice—almost an eagerness—that contrasted with the lofty and imperious tone I’d grown used to. They’d never sparked this much interest from me. “Would you lik  
e to begin the first steps toward purging your soul—and seeing your family?”  
  
  How long had I languished in this cell, moving in and out of agitated consciousness? When I felt my torso and arms, I could tell I’d lost a considerable amount of weight, the kind of weight loss that took weeks. Weeks, months … I had no idea. And while I was here, the world was going on without me—a world full of people who needed me.  
  
  “Sydney?”  
  
  Not wanting to sound too eager, I tried to stall. “How do I know I can trust you? That you’ll let me see my family if I … begin this journey?”  
  
  “Evil and deception are not our ways,” the voice said. “We relish in light and honesty.”  
  
  Liars, liars, I thought. They’d lied to me for years, telling me good people were monsters and trying to dictate the way I lived my life. But it didn’t matter. They could keep their word or not about my family.  
  
  “Will I have … a real bed?” I managed to make my voice choke a little. The Alchemists had taught me to be an excellent actress, and now they’d see their training put to work.  
  
  “Yes, Sydney. A real bed, real clothes, real food. And people to talk to—people who’ll help you if you’ll only listen.”  
  
  That last part sealed the deal. If I were going to be put regularly around others, surely they couldn’t keep drugging the air. As it was, I could feel myself being especially alert and agitated now. They were piping in that stimulant, something that would make me anxious and want to act rashly. It was a good trick on a worn and frazzled mind, and it was working—just not how they’d expected.  
  
  Out of old habit, I put my hand on my collarbone, touching a cross that was no longer there. Don’t let them change me, I prayed silently. Let me keep my mind. Let me endure whatever there is to come.  
  
  “Sydney?”  
  
  “What do I have to do?” I asked.  
  
  “You know what you have to do,” the voice said. “You know what you have to say.”  
  
  I moved my hands to my heart, and my next internal words weren’t a prayer, but a silent message to Adrian: Wait for me. Be strong, and I’ll be strong too. I’ll fight my way out of whatever they’ve got in store. I won’t forget you. I won’t ever turn my back on you, no matter what lies I have to tell them. Our center will hold.  
You know what you have to say,” the voice repeated. It was practically salivating.  
  
  I cleared my throat. “I have sinned against my own kind and let my soul become corrupted. I am ready to have the darkness purged.”  
  
  “And what are your sins?” the voice demanded. “Confess what you’ve done.”  
  
  That was harder, but I still managed the words. If it got me closer to Adrian and freedom, I could say anything.  
  
  I took a deep breath and said: “I fell in love with a vampire.”  
  
  And like that, I was blinded by light.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Adrian  
  
  “DON’T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, but you look like crap.”  
  
  I lifted my head from the table and squinted one eye open. Even with sunglasses on—indoors—the light was still almost too much for the pounding in my head. “Really?” I said. “There’s a right way to take that?”  
  
  Rowena Clark fixed me with an imperious look that was so like something Sydney might have done. It caused a lurch in my chest. “You can take it constructively.” Rowena’s nose wrinkled. “This is a hangover, right? Because, I mean, that implies you were sober at one point. And from the gin factory I can smell, I’m not so sure.”  
  
  “I’m sober. Mostly.” I dared to take off the sunglasses to get a better look at her. “Your hair’s blue.”  
  
  “Teal,” she corrected, touching it self-consciously. “And you saw it two days ago.”  
  
  “Did I?” Two days ago would’ve been our last mixed media class here at Carlton College. I could barely remember two hours ago. “Well. It’s possible I actually wasn’t so sober then. But it looks nice,” I added, hoping that would spare me some disapproval. It didn’t.  
  
  In truth, my sober days at school were about fifty-fifty lately. Considering I was making it to class at all, though, I thought I deserved some credit. When Sydney had left—no, been taken—I hadn’t wanted to come here. I hadn’t wanted to go anywhere or do anything that wasn’t finding her. I’d curled up in my bed for days, waiting and reaching out to her through the world of dreams with spirit. Only I hadn’t connected. No matter what time of day I tried, I never seemed to find her asleep. It made no sense. No one could stay awake that long. Drunk people were hard to connect to since alcohol dampened spirit’s effects and blocked the mind, but somehow I doubted she and her Alchemist captors were having nonstop cocktail parties.  
  
  I might have doubted myself and my own abilities, especially after I’d used medication to turn spirit off for a while. But my magic had eventually come back in full force, and I’d had no difficulties reaching out to others in their dreams. Maybe I was inept at a lot of other things in life, but I was still hands down the most skilled dream-walking spirit user I knew. The problem was, I only knew a few other spirit users, period, so there wasn’t a lot of advice I could get on why I wasn’t reaching Sydney. All Moroi vampires use some sort of elemental magic. Most specialize in one of the four physical elements: earth, air, water, or fire. Only a handful of us use spirit, and there’s no well-documented history of it like there is of the other elements. There were a lot of theories, but no one knew for sure why I wasn’t reaching Sydney.  
  
  My professor’s assistant dropped a stack of stapled papers in front of me and an identical one in front of Rowena, jarring me out of my thoughts. “What’s this?”  
  
  “Um, your final exam,” said Rowena, rolling her eyes. “Let me guess. You don’t remember this either? Or me offering to study with you?”  
  
  “Must have been an off day for me,” I muttered, flipping uneasily through the pages.  
  
  Rowena’s chastising expression turned to one of compassion, but whatever else she might have said was swallowed by our professor’s orders to be quiet and get to work. I stared at the exam and wondered if I could fake my way through it. Part of what had dragged me out of bed and back to college was knowing how much education meant to Sydney. She’d always been envious of the opportunity I had, an opportunity her controlling asshole dad had denied her. When I’d realized that I couldn’t find her right away—and believe me, I’d tried plenty of mundane ways, along with the magical ones—I’d resolved to myself that I’d carry on and do what she would have wanted: finish this semester at college.  
  
  Admittedly, I hadn’t been the most dedicated of students. Since most of my classes were introductory art ones, my professors were usually good about giving credit as long as you turned something in. That was lucky for me because “something” was probably the nicest description for some of the crap pieces I’d created recently. I’d maintained a passing grade—barely—but this exam might do me in. These questions were all or nothing, right or wrong. I couldn’t just half-ass a drawing or painting and count on points for effort.  
  
  As I began making my best attempts at answering questions on contour drawing and deconstructed landscapes, I felt the dark edges of depression pulling me down. And it wasn’t just because I was likely going to fail the class. I was also going to fail Sydney and her high expectations of me. But really, what was one class when I’d already failed her in so many other ways? If our roles had been reversed, she probably would’ve found me by now. She was smarter and more resourceful. She could’ve done the extraordinary. I couldn’t even handle the ordinary.  
  
  I turned in the exam an hour later and hoped I hadn’t just wasted an entire semester in the process. Rowena had finished early and was waiting for me outside the classroom. “You want to get something to eat?” she asked. “My treat.”  
  
  “No thanks. I’ve got to go meet my cousin.”  
  
  Rowena regarded me warily. “You aren’t driving yourself, are you?”  
  
  “I’m sober now, thank you very much,” I told her. “But if it makes you feel better, no, I’m taking the bus.”  
  
  “Then I guess this is it, huh? Last day of class.”  
  
  I supposed it was, I realized with a start. I had a couple other classes, but this was my only one with her. “I’m sure we’ll see each other again,” I said valiantly.  
  
  “I hope so,” she said, eyes filled with concern. “You’ve got my number. Or at least you used to. I’ll be around this summer. Give me and Cassie a call if you want to hang out … or if there’s anything you want to talk about. … I know you’ve had some rough things to deal with lately. …”  
  
  “I’ve dealt with rougher,” I lied. She didn’t know the half of it, and there was no way she could, not as an ordinary human. I knew she thought Sydney had broken up with me, and it killed me to see Rowena’s pity. I could hardly correct her, though. “And I’ll definitely get in touch, so you’d better sit by your phone. See you around, Ro.”  
  
  She gave me a half-hearted wave as I walked off toward the nearest campus bus stop. It wasn’t that far away, but I found myself sweating by the time I reached it. It was May in Palm Springs, and our fleeting spring was being trampled into the ground by summer’s hot and sweltering approach. I popped the sunglasses back on as I waited and tried to ignore the hipster couple smoking beside me. Cigarettes, at least, were one vice I hadn’t returned to since Sydney went away, but it was hard sometimes. Very hard.  
  
  To distract myself, I opened up my bag and peered inside at a small statue of a golden dragon. I rested my hand on his back, feeling his tiny scales. No artist could’ve created such a perfect work of art because he wasn’t actually a sculpture. He was a real dragon—well, a callistana, to be precise, which was a type of benign demon—that Sydney had summoned. He’d bonded to her and to me, but only she had the ability to transform him between living and frozen forms. Unfortunately for Hopper here, he’d been trapped in this state when she was abducted, meaning he was stuck in it. According to Sydney’s magical mentor, Jackie Terwilliger, Hopper was technically still alive but living a pretty miserable existence without food and activity. I took him everywhere I went and didn’t know if contact with me meant anything to him. What he really needed was Sydney, and I couldn’t blame him. I needed her too.  
  
  I’d been telling Rowena the truth: I was sober now  
. And that was by design. The long bus ride ahead gave me the perfect opportunity to seek Sydney. Even though I no longer tried to reach out to her in dreams as voraciously as I once had, I still made a point to sober up a few times a day and search. As soon as the bus was moving and I was settled into my seat, I drew upon the spirit magic within me, exalting briefly in the glorious way it made me feel. It was a double-edged joy, though, one that was tempered by the knowledge that spirit was slowly driving me insane.  
  
  Insane is such an ugly word, a voice in my head said. Think of it as obtaining a new look at reality.  
  
  I winced. The voice in my head wasn’t my conscience or anything like that. It was my dead Aunt Tatiana, former queen of the Moroi. Or, well, it was spirit making me hallucinate her voice. I used to hear her when my mood dropped to particularly low places. Now, ever since Sydney had left, this phantom Aunt Tatiana had become a recurring companion. The bright side—if you could even look at it that way—was that some of the bipolar side effects of spirit had become less frequent. It was as though spirit’s madness had shifted form. Was it better to have mental conversations with an imagined deceased relative than to be subject to wildly dramatic mood swings? I honestly wasn’t sure.  
  
  Go away, I told her. You aren’t real. Besides, it’s time to look for Sydney.  
  
  Once I’d connected with the magic, I stretched my senses out, searching for Sydney—the person I knew better than anyone else on this earth. Finding someone asleep whom I knew only a little would’ve been easy. Finding her—if she were asleep—would’ve been effortless. But I made no contact and eventually let go of the magic. She either wasn’t asleep or was still blocked from me. Defeated once again, I found a flask of vodka in my bag and settled in on it as I waited out the ride to Vista Azul.  
  
  I was pleasantly buzzed, cut off from my magic but not from my heartache, when I arrived at Amberwood Preparatory School. Classes had just finished for the afternoon, and students in stylish uniforms were moving back and forth between the buildings, off to study or make out or whatever it was high school kids did near the end of term. I walked to the girls’ dorm and then waited outside for Jill Mastrano Dragomir to find me.  
  
  Whereas Rowena had only guessed at what was troubling me, Jill knew exactly what my problems were. This was because fifteen-year-old Jill had the “benefit” of being able to see into my mind. Last year, she’d been targeted by assassins wanting to dethrone her sister, who happened to be queen of the Moroi and a good friend of mine. Technically, those assassins had succeeded, but I’d brought Jill back through more of spirit’s extraordinary abilities. That feat of healing had taken a huge toll on me and also forged a psychic bond that let Jill know my thoughts and feelings. I knew my recent bout of depression and binge drinking had been hard on her—though at least the drinking numbed out the bond some days. If Sydney had been around, she would’ve scolded me for being selfish and not thinking of Jill’s feelings. But Sydney wasn’t around. The weight of responsibility rested on me alone, and I wasn’t strong enough to shoulder it, it seemed.  
  
  Three campus shuttle buses came and went, and Jill wasn’t on any of them. This was our usual day of the week to get together, and I’d made sure to keep up with that, even if I couldn’t keep up with anything else. I took out my phone and texted her: Hey, I’m here. Everything okay?  
  
  No answer came, and a prickle of worry started to go through me. After the assassination attempt, Jill had been sent here to hide among humans in Palm Springs because a desert was no place that either our kind or the Strigoi—evil, undead vampires—wanted to be. The Alchemists—a secret society of humans hell-bent on keeping humans and vampires away from each other—had sent Sydney as a liaison to make sure things went smoothly. The Alchemists had wanted to make sure the Moroi didn’t plunge into civil war, and Sydney had done a good job of helping Jill through all sorts of ups and downs. Where Sydney had failed, however, was in getting romantically involved with a vampire. That kind of went against the Alchemists’ operating procedure of humans and vampires keeping apart from each other, and the Alchemists had responded brutally and efficiently.  
  
  Even after Sydney had left and her stiff-faced replacement, Maura, had come, things had remained relatively calm for Jill. There’d been no sign of danger from any source, and we even had indications that she could return to mainstream Moroi society once her school year finished next month. This kind of disappearance was out of character, and when I didn’t get a text response from her, I sent one to Eddie Castile.  
  
  Whereas Jill and I were Moroi, he was a dhampir—a race born of mixed human and vampire blood. His kind trained to be our defenders, and he was one of the best. Unfortunately, his formidable battle skills hadn’t been enough when Sydney had tricked him into splitting up from her when the Alchemists had come after her. She’d done it to save him, sacrificing herself, and he couldn’t get over that. That humiliation had killed the kindling romance between him and Jill because he no longer felt he was worthy of a Moroi princess. He still dutifully served as her bodyguard, however, and I knew that if anything had happened to her, he’d be the first to know.  
  
  But Eddie didn’t answer my text either, and neither did the other two dhampirs serving undercover as her protectors. That was weird, but I tried to reassure myself that radio silence from all of them probably meant they’d gotten distracted together and were fine. Jill would show up soon.  
  
  The sun was bothering me again, so I walked around the building and found another bench that was out of the way and shaded by palm trees. I made myself comfortable on it and soon fell asleep, helped by both staying out late at the bar last night and by finishing off my vodka flask. A murmur of voices woke me later, and I saw that the sun had moved considerably in the sky above me. Also above me were Jill and Eddie’s faces, along with our friends Angeline, Trey, and Neil.  
  
  “Hey,” I croaked, managing to sit up. “Where were you?”  
  
  “Where were you?” Eddie asked pointedly.  
  
  Jill’s green eyes softened as she looked at me. “It’s okay. He’s been here the whole time. He forgot. Understandable since … well, he’s going through a tough time.”  
  
  “Forgot what?” I asked, looking uneasily from face to face.  
  
  “It doesn’t matter,” said Jill evasively.  
  
  “What did I forget?” I exclaimed.  
  
  Angeline Dawes, one of Jill’s dhampir protectors, proved as usual to be the voice of bluntness. “Jill’s end-of-term expo.”  
  
  I stared blankly, and then it all came back to me. One of Jill’s extracurricular activities was a fashion design and sewing club. She’d started off modeling, but when that proved too public and dangerous in her position, she’d recently tried her hand at designing behind the scenes—and had found she was pretty good at it. She’d been talking for the last month about a big show and exhibit her club was doing as their end-of-term project, and it had been good to see her so excited about something again. I knew she was hurt over Sydney too, and with my transferred depression and her botched romance with Eddie, she’d lived under a cloud nearly as dark as my own. This show and the chance to display her work had been one bright spot for her—small in the grand scheme of things but monumentally important in the life of a teenage girl who needed some normality.  
  
  And I’d blown it off.  
  
  Bits of conversation came back to me now, her telling me the day and time, and me promising I’d come and support her. She’d even made a point to remind me the last time I’d seen her this week. I’d noted what she said and then went out to celebrate Tequila Tuesday at a bar near my apartment. Saying her show had slipped my mind was an understatement.  
  
  “Crap, I’m sorry, Jailbait. I tried texting. …” I lifted up my phone to show them, except it was the vodka flask I picked up instead. I hastily shoved it back in the bag.  
  
  “We had to turn our phones off during the show,” explained Neil. He was the third dhampir in the group, a recent addition to Palm Springs. He’d grown on me over time, maybe because he was suffering from his  
own heartache. He was head over heels for a dhampir girl who’d dropped off the face of the earth, though unlike Sydney, Olive Sinclair’s silence was most likely from personal baggage and not Alchemist abduction.  
  
  “Well … how it’d go then?” I attempted. “I bet your stuff was awesome, right?”  
  
  I felt so incredibly stupid, I could hardly stand it. Maybe I couldn’t fight against what the Alchemists had done to Sydney. Maybe I couldn’t prepare for an exam. But for God’s sake, I should’ve at least been able to make it to one girl’s fashion show! All I had to do was show up, sit there, and applaud. I’d failed at even that, and the weight of it was suddenly crushing. A black haze filled my mind, weighing me down, making me hate everything and everyone—myself most of all. It was no wonder I couldn’t save Sydney. I couldn’t even take care of myself.  
  
  You don’t need to, Aunt Tatiana whispered in my mind. I’ll take care of you.  
  
  A spark of compassion showed in Jill’s eyes as she sensed the dark mood coming on. “It was great. Don’t worry—we’ll show you pictures. They had a professional photographer doing everything, and it’ll go online.”  
  
  I tried to swallow back that darkness and managed a tense smile. “Glad to hear it. Well, how about we all go out and celebrate then? Dinner’s on me.”  
  
  Jill’s face fell. “Angeline and I are eating with a study group. I mean, maybe I could cancel. Exams are still a month away, so I could always—”  
  
  “Forget it,” I said, getting to my feet. “Someone in this bond needs to be ready for exams. Go have fun. I’ll catch you later.”  
  
  No one tried to stop me, but Trey Juarez soon fell in step with me. He was perhaps the oddest member of our circle: a human who’d once been part of a group of vampire hunters. He’d broken ties with them, both because they were psycho and because he’d fallen—against all reason—for Angeline. Those two were the only ones in our little group with any semblance of a happy love life, and I knew they tried to downplay it for the rest of us miserable souls.

Chapter 1

When I returned to the pack, with a carefully prepared gift for Sebastian, the pack house was empty. Only a table full of fresh flowers sat there.

Cheers and laughter drifted in from the garden as I walked step by step toward the sound.

“Alpha Sebastian, you’re so lucky! Your son is handsome, and your Luna is so beautiful.”

I froze at the sound of a man’s teasing voice from not far away.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

As I took another step forward, I finally saw Sebastian.

He was holding a baby in his arms, and a petite she-wolf was clinging to his side, her arm wrapped around his.

“Yeah, I’m definitely lucky. But the most important thing is, it’s all thanks to Emery,” he said softly, his eyes full of tenderness as he ruffled the she-wolf’s hair.

She giggled, covering her mouth, and her eyes were full of happiness.

A family of three looking so enviable, so perfect.

I stood there frozen, feeling like a mouse sneaking a peek at them.

Behind them, on the wall, hung a banner:
“Archer’s Baby Shower”

Archer…

Once, I had cuddled up to Sebastian, smiling sweetly at him as I said, “Sebastian, one day I want to give you a son, and we’ll name him Archer.”

He asked me why, and I grinned brightly. “Archer. I hope our child will be an amazing archer, a great warrior.”

And now, he had named the child of someone else and him Archer.

“By the way, Sebastian, Harper should be coming back to the pack soon, right? Aren’t you worried she’ll cause a scene when she finds out you’re a dad?” one of Sebastian’s friends asked.

But he just gently stroked the baby’s face in his arms. “I almost forgot, thanks for the reminder.”

With that, he immediately dialed a number and told the person on the other end of the line, “Tell Harper to stay in the North for a while longer. Don’t let her come back yet. Otherwise, if she finds out I have a son, she’ll definitely make a scene.”

My breath caught in my throat, and I took a step back.

Three years ago, it was Sebastian who had asked me to become a healer. He thought my personality was too wild—I would cry whenever something happened, and I would make a scene if I saw him with other she-wolves.

He had said to me then, “It’s not that I don’t like you, but your personality is too unstable. You’re not suited to be my Luna.”

“How about this,” he’d continued, “You become a healer for three years. It’ll help you temper your heart, and once you’ve gained some emotional stability, you’ll be ready to return as the Luna of mine and the pack.”

I believed him, so I worked hard, studied, and became a healer. I applied to join the battlefield rescue team at the Northern Border.

The day my application was accepted, I was over the moon.

I thought, if I could just make it through these three years, I could finally be Sebastian’s Luna.

But now, I had returned to find him a father.

When I came back to my senses, my face was already wet with tears, and the more I wiped them away, the more flowed.

“I really don’t want her to come back,” he had said.

⸻

Chapter 2

Sebastian lazily spoke, freeing one hand to intertwine his fingers with the she-wolf beside him.

“From now on, I just want to be with Emery, to be happy together for the rest of our lives.”

“How lucky you are! I want my mate to give me children, too!” someone cheered.

The others joined in the celebration.

“Then Sebastian, have you thought about how you’re going to explain this to Harper?” someone asked.

At the mention of my name, his expression quickly turned cold.

“I haven’t thought about bringing her back,” he said, lowering his head to comfort the she-wolf beside him.

“My beta will take care of everything, don’t worry. The only one by my side will be you.”

Suddenly, snowflakes began to fall from the sky, landing on my nose and freezing my heart.

Three years ago, on the day I left, I had grabbed Sebastian and asked him, “Sebastian, when I come back, will you really seal the mate bond with me and make me your Luna?”

He had ruffled my hair, his voice gentle, like a flowing stream. “Of course. By then, you’ll be much more mature.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll wait for you. The only one by my side will be you.”

But now, I had matured, and he was with another she-wolf.

Why?

Why did he lie to me?

My wolf let out a pained whimper, and my chest tightened with pain. Tears fell uncontrollably.

As I treated the wounded on the Northern Border, with artillery fire all around, I had kept thinking,
I have to survive. I have to survive so I can have the mating ceremony with Sebastian.

I had applied to return to the pack a year early, and today I finally came back. I had planned to surprise Sebastian, but he had already given me one.

“I heard Sebastian bought a cruise ship to hold the mating ceremony with Emery.”

I overheard someone talking and quickly hid behind a tree.

“Oh my God, that sounds amazing. I feel envious. But what about Harper? Isn’t she Sebastian’s fated mate? She loves Alpha the most.”

“Don’t you know? Three years ago, Sebastian tricked her into going to the Northern Border to become a healer. Whether she even makes it back alive is uncertain.”

“Sebastian just wants to be with Emery, but he’s afraid she’ll make a scene, so he’s doing this.”

“As soon as she left the pack and got to the Northern Border, Sebastian immediately got together with Emery.”

Their words were so clear, ringing in my ears.

So, Sebastian had planned this three years ago, while I had foolishly believed his words.

In such harsh conditions on the Northern Border, I never felt it was too hard because I thought if I just got through this, I’d return and be able to seal the mate bond with him.

These people walked away to offer their congratulations to Sebastian.

Suddenly, someone teased, “Sebastian, Harper is your mate. She’s loved you for so many years. Are you really willing to let her stay in such harsh conditions on the border as a healer?”

Sebastian didn’t even lift his eyelids, his eyes still fixed on his son.

“She’s the one who likes me, not the other way around.”

“If it weren’t for the fact that she’s the she-wolf my father adopted, and he really likes her, I would’ve cut ties with her a long time ago.”

“You all know, she’s seven years younger than me. I can’t possibly like her.”

“She’s been the one pestering me all these years.”

I was adopted by the Bluemoon Pack when I was 16, just barely coming of age.

At that time, Sebastian was already 23 and preparing to take on the role of the pack’s Alpha.

He was the heir to the pack, handsome, tall, and strong. So many she-wolves surrounded him, hoping to become his mate.

I would get jealous every time and find him to say, “Sebastian, can you not be so close with the other she-wolves?”

He would just laugh then, ruffle my face, and say, “Harper, I’ll do whatever you say.”

⸻

Chapter 3

When I was a teenager, I thought this was love.

I tried so hard to get closer to him, to understand his likes and dislikes, to become the person he would want.

At 18, I wore my first sexy dress and high heels.

At the mate gathering, just a future Alpha from another pack spoke to me for just a few moments, and Sebastian immediately pulled me into a corner and kissed me forcefully.

Under the messy strands of hair, his eyes flickered with the wolf’s shadow.

He pressed his forehead against mine and whispered, “You’re mine.”

At the start, it was always him giving me hope.

He acted like he liked me in every possible way.

But now, he said I had been the one bothering him.

I left in disappointment, unable to hold back my tears by the time I reached the door.

Shaking, I took out my phone and checked the latest message from Sebastian:
“Harper, happy birthday.”

When he sent the message, I was in the middle of saving a pregnant woman, covered in blood, having gone without sleep for a whole day and night.

But seeing his message, I felt re-energized.

Wiping away my tears, I tapped the voice call button and dialed him.

“Harper, what’s wrong?”

Sebastian’s voice was as gentle as ever.

He must have found a quiet place to take the call, since it had taken a while for him to pick up.

I wanted to speak, but my mind kept replaying the image of him holding a child and standing with another she-wolf.

“Harper bear?”

He called me that again.

He had always called me “Harper bear,” and I had once loved the nickname.

But now, it suddenly made me feel disgusted.

“Sebastian, I’m back at the pack.”

If he listened closely, he could hear the slight tremor in my voice.

But Sebastian didn’t seem to notice the difference.

He paused for a moment before asking, “Why did you come back?”

“Where are you now? I’ll come pick you up.”

To be honest, my heart had already shattered when I saw that scene in the garden of the pack house.

But now, he was speaking so gently.

“I’m at the pack house’s door.”

I replied softly.

This pack house had been a gift from Sebastian when I turned 18.

He had said to me then, “Harper, no matter who you’re with in the future, this house will always be yours because this will always be your home.”

“My people must have confidence.”

But now, he was living in this house with another she-wolf, and they had a child.

By the time Sebastian came out, I had already composed myself.

He stepped through the snow, walking toward me, his gaze filled with concern.

When he reached me, he immediately pulled me into his embrace, his warm breath tickling my ear.

“Harper bear, it’s been three years. You’ve lost weight.”

A peach-scented fragrance filled the air.

His scent had changed.

It used to be a light vanilla aroma.

I recoiled from his touch and pushed him away.

His pupils constricted for a second, then he smiled.

“Harper, you’ve grown up. Now you understand the differences between men and women.”

“But I’m still your future mate. Please don’t be distant with me, okay?”

He used to be the light in my life.

The reason I said this was because when I first joined the pack, I was very introverted.

I was often bullied at school, and once, after school, I was cornered by other pack members in an alley.

It was then that Sebastian suddenly appeared.

He drove a Maybach, cornered the bullies, then got out of the car and pulled me behind him.

I’d never forget the cold way he spoke to them,
“Harper is my sister. If anyone dares to bully her again, I won’t let you get away with it.”

⸻

Chapter 4

But now, I felt like he was a stranger.

His face was exactly the same as before, but I no longer felt that same flutter in my heart.

Sebastian reached out and touched my face, and I noticed the ring on his ring finger.

It hadn’t been there before.

“I’m tired. Can I go back to the pack house to rest first?”

I shifted my gaze and focused on his face, watching as panic flickered in his eyes.

“Okay… sure.”

“But today the pack is holding a baby shower after party. A friend of mine, also one of our pack members, has become a father, but there was no place to hold the baby shower for his child, so they came to our house.”

“You don’t mind, do you?”

Before, I thought of him as my guardian. Every time I was hurt, he would show up just in time.

Whenever I wasn’t feeling well, he would calmly take care of me.

One winter, we went out together to buy fireworks and witnessed a couple arguing.

The cause was the man had deceived the woman and was seeing another girl.

At the time, he told me, “Harper, keep your eyes peeled when choosing your mate in the future. You should find someone like me, the gold standard.”

“I’ll never lie to you.”

But now, all he spoke were lies.

Maybe because I had really become more mature, I didn’t want to expose him.

I wanted to see just how long he could keep deceiving me.

“I don’t mind.”

When Sebastian heard this, he smiled. He tried to pull me closer, but I dodged him.

A flicker of surprise passed through his eyes, but then he gave a self-assuring smile.

“You’ve grown distant with me now.”

“It’s okay. I’ll stay by your side and help you become the way you were before.”

But in my heart, I knew too well I could never go back to how things were.

Three years ago, he had tricked me into going to the battlefield in Northern Border to become a healer.

I had seen too much death and loss. I had watched a little girl smile at me one moment, and the next, she turned into a cold, lifeless body.

At that time, I realized I had to learn to cherish time.

Because one never knew which would come first—tomorrow or an unexpected accident.

So now, I didn’t want to waste my time on someone who didn’t deserve it.

Sebastian didn’t take me to the master bedroom where I used to sleep. Instead, he led me to the guest room.

He explained, “It’s not convenient because of the baby, so he’s temporarily staying in the master bedroom.”

“Once things settle down in a few days, I’ll have the maid thoroughly clean the room. Would you be okay with staying then?”

“Okay.”

I set my bag down.

He looked at me for a few seconds before adding, “I guess you and I don’t like noisy scenes. You rest here, and I’ll go handle some things.”

After Sebastian left, I took a stone from my pocket, one with the English engraving: “Peace and Joy.”

It had been given to me by a little boy while I was assisting at the Northern Border.

At the time, his parents had passed, and he was all alone.

He handed me the stone with his dark hand and said,
“Doctor, this is for you. You can give it to your beloved mate and wish him safety.”

I had accepted it and was about to get up to get him some candy when, in the next second, he was shot in the head and collapsed in front of me.

I had cried hysterically, wanting to save him, but the other healers took me away.

Coming back to the present, I opened the door to the guest room and took a careful look at the pack house.

In my excitement, I had forgotten to observe earlier.

There were signs of another she-wolf in the house.

In the bathroom, there were women’s towels and skincare products.

On the coffee table, there were flowers, a baby bottle, and children’s toys.

⸻

Chapter 5

After watching all that, I walked toward the master bedroom.

I had once lived here, and Sebastian had decorated it according to my preferences back then.

Just as my hand touched the doorknob, a woman’s voice interrupted me.

“Are you Harper?”

I turned around to see the she-wolf Sebastian had called Emery standing behind me.

She was a bit fuller-figured, wearing a loose dress, but her eyes were beautiful—large and bright, looking very kind.

“I am.”

When I used to work as a healer, many people would ask if I was Harper.

I would always respond firmly that I was, and I guess that became a habit of mine.

She looked me up and down, then suddenly sneered.

“Sebastian hasn’t told you, has he? I’m his future Luna.”

“We already have a son.”

A sharp pain flared in my chest, but I was able to hide my emotions now.

“I know.”

“Then why are you back if you have known?” she asked, glaring at me.

“This is no longer your home. You’re just an outsider.”

She lunged at me, trying to hit me, but I caught her wrist.

“You just had a baby, don’t let your emotions run high, it’s not good for your health.”

At my words, shock flashed in her eyes.

For some reason, I couldn’t bring myself to hate her.

Because I realized she wasn’t at fault. She was just afraid I would steal the person she loved.

“Don’t worry. Although Sebastian and I are fated mates and we promised to seal the mate bond once I come back, now that he has a child, I… won’t bother him anymore.”

As soon as I finished speaking, she suddenly shoved me away with all her strength and collapsed onto the floor.

“I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have taken Sebastian away.”

“Harper, what are you doing?”

Sebastian’s voice came from behind me, and then I felt my body being violently shoved.

The next thing I knew, my face stung from a slap.

Everything around me spun, and Sebastian’s figure appeared hazy in front of me.

His voice, however, was loud and clear in my ears.

“Emery is my future Luna, so what? We have a son, so what?”

“She’s kind and graceful, unlike you, who only knows how to cry and make a scene, even using such tricks to bully others.”

“Harper, you really disgust me.”

“I’m giving you three seconds. Apologize to Emery right now.”

As my vision cleared, I saw Sebastian standing with Emery, holding her tightly in front of me.

His eyes were cold, filled with disdain for me.

Below, other pack members were watching us, gossiping.

“Damn, Harper actually came back.”

“She’s changed so much—her hair’s longer, and she’s slimmer now.”

“Why does she feel so different? She doesn’t look like the same immature girl anymore.”

In the Northern Border, I had once been shot in the leg.

Because we had run out of antibiotics, I faced a great risk of death.

But I remembered the herbal remedies from medical books and treated myself.

At the time, I thought if Sebastian heard about this, he’d think I was brave.

But now, he wasn’t the Sebastian I once loved.

During breaks, I would pull out a picture of Sebastian from my bag and look at it.

The other healers would joke, “Harper, you’re always so calm in the face of everything. The guy you like must be really great, right?”

Yes, I liked Sebastian because of how amazing he was.

I admired his confidence when facing other Alphas, his calmness in handling things, and his bravery in front of other pack members.

I had learned so much from him, and he had always guided me forward.

But now…

At that moment, I truly realized I no longer liked Sebastian.

“I didn’t push her,” I said to Sebastian.

“She fell on her own.”

“Do you think I’ll believe that? I saw it with my own eyes!” Sebastian snapped angrily.

“I know you found out about me and Emery having a child, so now you’re breaking down, right?”

“Harper, do you know why I don’t like you? Because I hate how vile and disgusting you are!”

I suddenly laughed.

“Sebastian, do you know how many children there are in the disaster-stricken packs and how many people there need us healers to save them?”

“I really regret coming back to the pack for you.”

“My time should have been spent on more important things.”

With that, I turned and left.

This time, I didn’t shed a single tear for him.

The girl who once wept quietly behind him had finally grown up.

And now, I’m leaving—for good.

1mepj5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1mepj5f/the_heart_tree_part_1/,THE HEART TREE - Part 1,"""Mate, what's wrong?"" I said in a whisper. 

I had just closed the bathroom door behind me. Jake, my friend and university housemate, had already placed the toilet seat lid down and taken a seat. 

""I can't say,"" said Jake. 

It was near pitch black in the bathroom save for the strip of hallway light peeking beneath the door. Because of this, Jake's face looked a little spooky in the dark because I couldn't make out where his scrawny silhouette ended and the shadows of the bathroom began. 

""You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, mate,"" I said, ""I just want to know if you're in any kind of trouble."" 

""No, it's not like that,"" said Jake, pitifully, ""It's…it's just…ugh, I can't say."" 

My cheeks were fuzzy from the two large cans of energy drink I had imbibed and followed up with two regular bottles of vodka-and-lemonade. The alcohol content from the vodka-and-lemonade was so minimal there was no chance that I was drunk. But considering I rarely drank, and was therefore a major lightweight when it came to alcohol, I still felt noticeably tipsy. 

Jake on the other hand had finished half a bottle of vodka on his own, and had shown very little sign of slowing down.

""Ugh,"" Jake groaned, ""I think I'm going to have a panic attack."" 

""Is there anything I can do?"" I said. 

Jake shook his head slowly from side to side. Muffled laughter rose and fell from downstairs. 

""Sounds like they're having fun,"" I said. 

Two things happened then. 

The first, was Jake began to let out an increasingly agonised whine that would soon become uncontrolled sobbing. 

The second, was the sudden all-at-once arrival of a golden light so bright the only thing I thought it could be was the beginning of a nuclear bomb blast. 

I had checked my phone a few minutes prior to inviting Jake to go upstairs to the bathroom with me to talk, and it had been close to 9PM around that time. It had gotten dark around 4PM, and we weren't on the side of the house which would have streetlights shining in from outside. 

The new light pouring in from the bathroom window was brighter than peak daylight to the point I had to look away and shield my eyes. 

Screams from the others downstairs broke out too. 

And then just as Jake's sobbing reached its peak, a sound, like an explosion, reached my ears. 

And it was so loud I was certain it was a bomb. It had to be. What else could make such noise? It drowned every other sound out and made it impossible to think of anything else. 

Unable to see anything but bright burning gold light, and ears pierced with the catastrophically thunderous and unrelenting noise; I wondered if this was how I was going to die. 

If it was a nuclear bomb, or some similar doomsday device unleashed on the populace of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, the shockwave blast hadn't yet reached us. 

One second passed after another and still the near blinding gold light and the terrible noise like thousands of drums being played right outside the house continued. 

I had already pocketed my phone into my right jean pocket, which left me with my hands free to stuff my index fingers into my ears to muffle some of the painful thundering. 

The sheer unfamiliarity of what was happening had forced Jake out of his panic attack. He had his hands to his ears and his face was squinting and bathed in gold as he shouted something at me that I couldn't hear. At a guess I figured he was shouting my name. 

As much as it hurt to do so, I removed the finger from my left ear and pulled down the bathroom door handle. The second I had the door open I put the finger right back because it felt as if a screwdriver were being dug into my ear canal during that brief lapse.

I inched out of the bathroom and made sure Jake was following me before continuing on. With me leading, we both inched our way down the stairs. 

The house hallway was similarly bathed in gold from the biblical levels of light. 

Is the house going to catch fire? I wondered. 

The light was hot, like standing outside during a heatwave, which only worsened my fears that I was right – that there really had been a nuclear bomb that had gone off. 

But it had been maybe thirty seconds since the light and noise had started. Would it take that long for the nuclear bomb's shockwave to reach us? And wouldn't the radiation from the light cook us all alive way before the final destructive force? 

Afterimages, like negative coloured splotches, hovered over my field of vision. Even with my eyelids closed for as long as I dared to keep them shut whilst continuing down the hallway, it felt as if I had many hot lightbulbs shining in front of my face. 

I reached the living room at the back of the house and saw the bulk of the others standing near the sliding glass door. There were more than a dozen of them standing there, the light making them like scorched silhouettes.

And then all at once the light stopped, as if a switch had been flicked. My vision went dark, and the splotches in front of my eyes continued to bob and roam and block me from making out much of anything around me. 

Several seconds later the thundering noise stopped too. In its absence was silence pierced by a continuing shriek that I was sure was the aftermath of my eardrums suffering such brutal noise for so long, and not an actual sound to be heard. 

Over the course of a few minutes the best I could do was remain off to one side of the room hoping that I wasn't going to be near deaf and blind for the rest of my life. 

My hearing normalised first. The panicked crying and whimpers from some of the others in the living room met my ears. And soon after my vision adjusted to the darkness of the room, which was lit by a dim bulb light hanging from the ceiling. 

I knew, because I was the one hosting the house party, that there were fifteen of us including myself in the house. 

""It's a nuclear bomb!"" someone shouted. 

It was Tyler.

He was very tall and gangly, with long sandy-blonde hair tied back into a ponytail. The most distinctive items Tyler had worn for this evening were white and red-striped armwarmers that matched with his red and white converse shoes, on top of his overall effeminate grunge style. 

""If it's a nuclear bomb the shockwave would have hit us by now,"" I said. 

""I bet you France is cooked!"" said someone else. 

It was Jack. About as tall as me at five foot seven. Unlike me, he was Pakistani-Asian, whereas I was White-British. 

Also like me, Jack wasn't dressed effeminately, only three other guys at the party liked to dress in a girl-ish way, and neither Jack nor I were one of them. Instead I was dressed in a button down checkered shirt and blue jeans, and Jack in a simple dark green shirt and blue jeans.

""What do you mean?"" I said. 

""Isn't it obvious?"" said Jack, ""France just got bombed and that was the blast!"" 

""There's no way,"" came a monotone voice. 

It was Ben, the other tall guy of the group. Dressed in a shabby hoodie and blue jeans, with messy short hair. 

""If it was a nuclear bomb we'd all be dead."" 

""So what was it?"" said Jake. 

He was standing close to me, and his face, no longer bathed in gold from the light, nor the darkness from the bathroom, was instead a natural bronze from his Malaysian heritage. His scrawny body was clad in tight blue jeans and a bright pink sweater with an anime-style teddy bear depicted across the chest. 

Nobody had an answer. Over on the leather couch against the rear wall two of the girls, Georgia and Megan, were sitting and holding each other's hands for support. 

I found myself grinning despite the horrible pit of dread gnawing in my stomach, perhaps because this was by far the most exciting thing to ever happen in my life. 

""Maybe it's an alien invasion,"" I said, half-joking. 

""Ian, that ain't funny,"" said another voice. 

I saw Jake whip round to look at him first. Standing at the doorway, blocking most of it with his bulk, was Mark. He was about the same height as me, but much broader on account of his dedication in the last half year or so lifting weights and eating the right foods to bulk up. He did, however, look like he had just wandered out of his bedroom because he was wearing a simple tan t-shirt and brown three-quarter-length shorts, and he was wearing his usual dorky sandals. 

""Maybe it was a solar flare,"" came another voice. 

Over on the couch, next to Megan, his girlfriend, was Eddie. He was a bit shorter than me, with a square-ish head and his frame drowned in an oversized hoodie. I couldn't remember what it was he was currently studying at university, but I knew it was something that required a lot of brains. 

""If it was a solar flare all our phones wouldn't be working,"" said Georgia. 

She was a very rotund girl with a head of long curly hair, and she also happened to be Tyler's girlfriend. Her eyes were wide open, as if she were on drugs. Her hands, still holding onto Megan's, were trembling. 

Because of Georgia mentioning our phones, everyone in the room retrieved their phones to take a look. The light from all the screens filled the dimly lit living space some more. 

""My phone's still working but I don't have internet,"" said Jack next to me with his phone in his hand. 

Tyler let out an aggravated rasp. 

""Yeah I got no internet either,"" he said. 

Several of the others in the room mumbled they also had no internet on their phones. I checked my phone and, like the rest, I didn't have any internet.

""Maybe we should check outside?"" came another voice. 

It was Dave, Mark's younger brother. He looked a lot like Mark except a year or so younger and without any of the benefit of having lifted weights. 

""No, you're not going outside,"" said Mark, in a way that left no room for debate. 

Dave listened to his brother without further rebuttal. 

""So it wasn't a solar flare, probably,"" I said, ""Because the lights are still on and our phones are still working. And it wasn't a–"" 

I had to stop speaking to swallow, my mouth feeling incredibly parched all of a sudden, and the fear which gripped me was making it hard to catch my breath. 

""--and,"" I said, once I took a moment to breathe, ""it wasn't a nuclear blast because we're all still alive. Even if it hit France or wherever I bet we'd all be dead right now."" 

""What if it was something stupid?"" said Phillip from a chair in the corner of the room. Philip, like Jake, was very scrawny and even more effeminate in his mannerisms. Unlike Jake, he was also mixed-raced African.

""Like,"" he said, ""What if it was like a big firework or something?"" 

""That wasn't a firework,"" said Ben. 

""Then what was it?"" said Georgia, and then she pointed at me, ""And don't say aliens."" 

I threw my hands up mock guiltily to help lighten the serious mood. This earned a few forced laughs from some of the others in the room, if only so they could let themselves feel something other than terrible dread about whatever had happened, and perhaps was still happening. 

""I don't have any signal,"" said another boy who was sitting in the large green leather armchair in the corner of the room, adjacent to where Megan and Georgia were sitting together. 

It was Oscar, a portly boy with a head of balding hair despite being only around eighteen years of age. 

""I don't think we can even call the police,"" he said. 

Besides Oscar, was Gary, who, out of everyone in the room, seemed to be paying the least amount of attention to what had just happened. Instead, as was typical for him, he had a beer can in his hand which he contentedly drank from until the can was empty. And then he promptly started on what was likely his tenth (conservatively speaking) can of beer for the evening (any morning or afternoon drinks he might have had not included.) 

I decided to walk over to the sliding glass door which, were I to open it, led to the back garden. I saw my reflection in the glass and some of the faces of the others watching me from over by the couches around the coffee table (which was swamped in both opened and unopened bottles and cans of alcohol, with plenty of mixers too.) 

The living room was humid, sweaty, and stunk of alcohol. What I wanted was fresh air, but I didn't dare open the sliding glass door yet. 

Instead I raised my phone to the glass and used the phone's torchlight function to see further into the veil of darkness. 

Out in the back garden was the large leafless tree which must have been there for decades. Besides the tree I could see the patchy garden grass, and thorny bushes, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

""Do you see anything?"" said Mark from the doorway on the other side of the room. 

""Nothing abnormal,"" I said. 

I put my hand on the glass, and it was then I noticed I had spoken too soon. 

Something was falling in heaps outside. 

Because I was shining the torchlight the others caught a glimpse of the same falling stuff before I could call it out. 

Some of the guys raced to the sliding glass door and peered out, using the torchlight functions of their phones to add to mine to see what was happening outside. 

""Is it ash?"" said Jack. 

""It looks like ash,"" said Ben, ""But it's not."" 

""How do you know?"" I said. 

""Because if it was ash everything would be on fire outside,"" said Ben. 

""Let's open the door and we'll be able to tell,"" said Philip. 

He reached for the sliding door latch. Right away myself, Ben, and Tyler took hold of Philip's arms to stop him. 

""Okay! Okay! Get off me! GET OFF!"" Philip shouted. 

""Don't open the door,"" said Ben, keeping his grip on Philip like iron.

There wasn't anything personal about the way Ben said this in his usual monotone voice. But he was panicking like the rest of us. 

""I won't, get off,"" said Philip. 

Ben let him go, and so did the rest of us who had taken hold of Philip – for his protection and our own. 

""The air could be poisoned,"" said Jack, ""We better not risk it."" 

""Is everyone okay?"" came a new voice. 

It was Ellie. She was one of my housemates, and had simply been doing her own thing in her room when all the commotion began. She had her usual glasses on, and was in her pajamas. 

""We're okay,"" I said, ""We're just trying to figure out what all of that even was.""

""It was mad, init?"" said Ellie, ""I nearly shat myself when it started.""

What she just said earned another round of nervous laughter from most of the people in the room. 

""D'you think it was thunder and lightning?"" said Ellie. 

""Maybe,"" said another voice. 

This time it was Megan. Her voice was quivering from stress. Her hands gripping hold of Georgia's just as much as Georgia was gripping hers. 

""It started with just light,"" said Megan, freeing one of her hands to adjust her glasses, only to put her hand right back to firmly gripping Georgia's again, ""And then the light came a few seconds later. Just like thunder and lightning. But way bigger."" 

It was then I noticed the white puff of air leaving my mouth. The day had started cool, but not cold. And even over the recent Christmas period it hadn't been cold enough to be more than chilly. 

Everyone in rapid succession noticed their breaths catching in the air too. Not only that, we could all feel the temperature dropping. 

A cracking noise began to fill the air, and it was then those of us closest to the sliding glass door noticed frost climbing all over the glass.

I placed my hand against the glass and immediately noticed how cold it was. 

""How is it getting so cold?"" said Philip, ""The glass is frosting up!"" 

Ellie joined those of us who were standing at the sliding glass door. 

""This is bad,"" she said, ""The temperature shouldn't be dropping like this."" 

It was strange seeing genuine fear from Ellie. It simply wasn't an emotion I had ever seen from her, besides one time I pulled a particularly good prank on her. She was, perhaps second only to Jake or Mark, the person I was closest to in the whole house. 

""Oh gosh,"" said Jake, suddenly. 

He began to race to the doorway where Mark was standing off to the side from where he had moved to let Ellie in. 

""Jake, where are you going?"" I said. 

""Rebecca,"" said Jake, ""She's still in her room. I'm going to check on her."" 

Jake didn't wait for a response. Philip, his best friend since they were little, hurried after him. I decided to stay where I was. 

I began to shiver, my teeth chattering. I wasn't dressed at all for the cold. What sweaty humidity had been in the room before was gone. 

It was then Gary rose from his spot on one of the couches and, with a beer in his hand, he raised a toast to everyone. 

""Well,"" he said, in his usual slurred speech, ""If this is the end of the world, at least it's going down at a party. Cheers!"" 

He chugged the entirety of the beer, dropped the can to the carpet, and crushed it underfoot. 

""Hey!"" I shouted, ""Don't mess up my carpet!"" 

Gary looked both genuinely shocked at realising the bad of what he had just done, but also as if he were only half-awake. 

""Sorry, sorry,"" he slurred, ""I won't do it again, I'm very sorry."" 

I took a deep breath, which felt crisp and cold as if I had minty chewing gum in my mouth. 

""It's fine,"" I said, ""Just be respectful, mate. Any damages me and the rest of the housemates are going to have to pay for it."" 

""Come here, it's alright,"" Gary slurred. 

He stepped closer and embraced me in a hug. He reeked of booze and cigarettes; two smells which immediately brought my Dad to mind. I patted Gary on the back a few times to let him know there were no hard feelings, and eased away from him. 

""Piss it!"" someone shouted from the kitchen. 

It was Mark. 

Most of the others in the living room were busy checking their phones, trying to get any signal to make contact with the wider world. Others continued to peer out to the garden, where the newly falling snow – that had to be what it was – was falling with entrancing Yuletide heaviness. 

Which left just Ellie, Jack, and me, as the ones who hurried out of the living room at a brisk walking pace into the adjacent kitchen, which was just to the left down the hallway. 

Ellie was the first to enter, followed by me, and then Jack behind me. We arrived just in time to see Mark cursing several times as he wound the top hung windows shut using the hand levers. 

Even from the other side of the kitchen, which was about three-to-four strides in width, the cold blowing in from the windows was like pain in aerosol form. 

Mark shoved his hands under his armpits to get them warm, his face winced in pain. 

""You okay?"" said Ellie. 

""Yeah, great,"" said Mark, sarcastically. 

Then Ellie gasped. Before I could ask why she took a small piece of white plastic away from where it was set on the lime-green kitchen wall. It was a piece of plastic I had never cared to notice before. 

""It's below zero degrees centigrade in the house,"" said Ellie, both amazed and panicked. 

""How cold is it exactly?"" said Mark. 

""This thermometer doesn't go lower than zero,"" said Ellie. 

""You know what?"" said Jack from behind me. 

The rest of us looked over to him. 

""What if this is like in Millennium Warcry?"" He said, ""In the Millennium Warcry books there are these portals – warp gates – that open up. They require a vast amount of energy to open. They can make the weather go haywire."" 

""So aliens after all, then?"" I said. 

Jack, like Ellie, also looked both panicked and excited. 

""It'd be more like interdimensional space demons,"" said Jack, ""Though to use Warp Energy usually requires mass sacrifice of millions of innocent souls."" 

""Well,"" I said, ""We'll add that to the list of possibilities."" 

""Hey, I'm just saying, it could be,"" said Jack. 

""Yeah, yeah,"" I said, ""There's just a bit of a gap between a solar flare or nuclear bomb, compared to, you know, interdimensional hell demons. But hey, if you're right, I'll give you five quid."" 

""Really?"" said Jack, ""How about twenty?"" 

I shrugged. 

""Deal,"" I said. 

We shook hands on it. This was fine with me, I didn't expect interdimensional hell demons to be the likely cause, but I did want to keep the mood among everyone in the house light-hearted. 

""You know, it could be global warming?"" said Dave, who was peering in from the doorway. 

""It's not global warming you idiot,"" said Mark. 

""Okay,"" said Dave, ""Just thought it might be. Makes more sense than a sodding Warp Gate. No offense, Jack."" 

""Hah,"" Jack laughed, ""It's cool."" 

""Crap,"" I said. 

I'd just realised something. 

""Ian?"" said Ellie.

I turned to her and Mark. 

""Can you both make sure everything is sealed inside the kitchen and living room? No air gaps to let the cold in? If it gets any colder we're all going to be in serious trouble.""

""Yeah,"" said Mark.

""Yeah, good idea,"" said Ellie. 

""Good,"" I said, ""I'll make sure upstairs doesn't have any obvious gaps."" 

""Erm,"" said Dave, from the doorway again, ""Maybe we should get blankets and stuff for people down here? It's cold."" 

""We know it's cold,"" said Mark, ""But yeah, good idea. We'll see to that after."" 

It was hard not to notice how happy Dave looked to receive a positive affirmation from his brother for a change. I felt a little relieved about it too. 

Mark and Ellie, joined by Jack and Dave, set to work making sure any and all ways for the cold to get into the house from the ground floor was blocked. 

With that being handled, I hurried upstairs to do the same for the other rooms. I had hoped the motion of running up the stairs would have warmed me up some, instead it made me that much more aware of how not dressed for the cold I was. 

Alone after reaching the top of the stairs, without the warmth of the others around me, the whole situation seemed far bleaker and scarier. Goosebumps spread over my arms, and my socked feet were numbing from the cold. 

Before I could reach my room, which was the room at the far end of the hallway from the stairs, I stopped at the doorway adjacent to my room – which was Rebecca's bedroom. 

Inside the room were Jake and Philip, who were kneeling on the ground with Rebecca who was sitting like an overweight panda wearing a pink onesie between them. 

And it was then I noticed Jake was busy trying to pull a loosened noose cord away from Rebecca's neck. Her neck, which looked raw and bruised from the cord already having dug hard around her throat. 

Rebecca's eyes were open but also downturned, as if she were close to falling asleep. For several surreal moments I simply stood and stared at Rebecca – because I couldn't see if she was breathing. 

Finally, I noticed the rise and fall of her chest, and then several hampered coughs escaping her. 

I looked around the hallway to see if anyone else might have followed me up the stairs. It was a needless gesture, but I did it anyway just to be sure. 

I then moved into Rebecca's bedroom. 

Again, I couldn't find the words to ask what had happened, and was happening with Rebecca. 

The three of them took notice of me. 

""It's okay,"" said Jake, ""Rebecca just had an accident."" 

""Accident?"" I said in a whisper. 

There was an accusation in my tone because, right there above Rebecca's head where she was sitting, was the noose cord tied to the doorknob of her wardrobe. 

Jake finished removing the noose from around Rebecca's neck, and from the wardrobe doorknob. 

""Stay with her?"" said Jake, to Philip. 

""Don't go,"" Rebecca whined in a tiny voice. 

""I'll be right back,"" said Jake. 

He patted Rebecca's thigh and then stood quickly and hurried over to the bedroom doorway. 

""Want to go to my room?"" I whispered. 

""Yeah,"" said Jake. 

He closed Rebecca's door behind him and then we moved into my bedroom. I closed the door. I noticed also that my bedroom window was already shut, making there no need to close it. My bedroom was on the side of the house where the streetlights could shine in from the window. They were shining in, but much fainter due to the sheer volume of falling snow outside. Or at least, it was what I assumed was snow. 

""What's going on with Rebecca?"" I whispered, ""Did she just try and–"" I struggled to find the right words yet again, ""--take her own life?"" 

""Mhm,"" Jake mumbled. 

Then, after an uncomfortable silence, he whispered, ""It's not the first time she's done this."" 

""What?"" I said, alarmed. 

""I know, I know,"" said Jake, ""Usually she just does it because she wants attention. She has mood swings. The other times she's done this all she needs is some food and drinks she likes and some company."" 

""Are you nuts?"" I said, struggling to stop myself from yelling, ""She had a noose around her neck, man."" 

""I know,"" said Jake, ""I didn't know what to do. The university already knows about it. She's been going to counseling sessions."" 

""Mate,"" I said, ""Don't you think this was something you might have wanted to mention to me? My room is right next to hers."" 

""I know,"" said Jake, again, ""But I didn't want to make things worse for her. She promised me not to tell anyone else about it."" 

My head started to spin. I sat on my bed, which was unmade and littered with the clothes I had tried on and decided weren't the kind of fashion I wanted to wear for the party. 

""So she just tried to take her life?"" I said. 

""I don't think she was really trying,"" Jake whispered, ""I know it sounds bad but it's more of an attention thing.""

""You said that,"" I said. 

""The big explosion outside shocked her,"" said Jake. 

""Shocked her?"" I said. 

""No, not shock-shocked,"" said Jake, ""She was getting herself ready and then the explosion startled her and then she actually started to – you know. All the other times she just sort of sits there with the noose around her neck. She texts me what she's doing and then I come and help her."" 

""Jake,"" I groaned. 

""It's fine, it's fine,"" said Jake, ""It's all fine. Just leave it to me and Philip. Please don't tell anyone, okay? Please."" 

There was a pause. Not because I was deliberating what to do, but because I simply felt overwhelmed with everything that was already happening. The big golden explosion, or whatever it was, was bad enough. Though Rebecca and I were certainly not close and in fact didn't like each other all that much, the idea that she had just attempted suicide, and in fact had toyed with attempting suicide several times before was simply beyond the pale. 

""Okay,"" I said, finally, ""Does she need anything? There's a first aid kit under the kitchen sink."" 

""No, she's fine. She just has a sore neck,"" said Jake. 

Jake opened my bedroom door. 

""I need to get back to her,"" he said, ""Thanks for understanding."" 

""Wait,"" I said. 

Jake stopped. 

""Yeah?"" he said. 

""Was this what you were trying to tell me about?"" I said. 

Jake shook his head from side to side and whispered, ""No.""

""You want to tell me now?"" I said. 

""Later,"" he said, ""It's not important right now.""

Jake then made his way back into Rebecca's room and closed the door behind him. 

I let out a ragged sigh.

1mephc3,https://i.redd.it/6c4achxxucgf1.jpeg,Done Hiding as Your Backup Plaything I'm Shining Golden as a Queen,"The night after our SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card.


In the heat of passion, I couldn't help but let out a soft moan, only to hear him whisper ""Rosalia.""


But my name is Aurelia Cooper, and Rosalia is my twin sister.


I looked at Luigi uncertainly. ""Who did you just call?""


""Aurelia,"" Luigi said without missing a beat, leaning down to kiss my eyelids. ""Getting distracted right now? What, am I not doing this right?""


His movements became more aggressive, wiping away all my doubts.


Luigi was our school's star hockey player—not only skilled in technique but also blessed with seemingly endless stamina.


Wave after wave of sensation hit me as I weakly pushed against his chest.


""Stop... please...""


He pressed his lips to my ear, voice rough. ""Baby, let's try you on top.""


All night long, he had me every which way, flipping me around despite my tears and begging for breaks.


It wasn't until sunrise that he finally rolled off, satisfied, and headed to the shower.


I lay there completely wrecked, feeling like I'd been hit by a truck.


That's when his phone on the nightstand started going off like crazy.


Luigi's phone. I glanced over and saw a Snapchat notification pop up.


Yooo Luigi finally got his dick wet last night!


My stomach dropped. I couldn't help myself—I grabbed his phone and opened Snapchat.


When I scrolled through the group chat with his hockey teammates, I froze in shock.


In the middle of the night, Luigi had actually sent a photo of our bloodstained sheets to the team group chat!


Below the photo was a string of messages—


Tyler_Hockey23: No fucking way bro, you actually banged Aurelia Cooper? Thought you were obsessed with her sister Rosalia?


JakeIce99: Dude you're missing the point. They're identical twins—same face, same body. Luigi's just using Aurelia for target practice, you know? Getting his technique down before he goes after Rosalia so he doesn't mess it up with his real crush.


Marcus_Puck: Smart move. Rosalia's wifey material. Better to break in that virgin dick on the practice dummy first, then he'll know how to treat a queen right...


BradSticks: Bet Aurelia was tight as fuck though. Lucky bastard.


Tyler_Hockey23: Think she knows she's just the warm-up act? ?


Each disgusting message felt like a knife to my chest, leaving me completely numb.


I'd imagined a million reasons why Luigi might want me, but never this.


Luigi wasn't just our hockey captain—he was Mr. Popular, friends with everyone. Meanwhile, I was the quiet nerd that teachers loved and most students ignored.


Our personalities were completely different who should never have crossed paths.


But during sophomore year, I had an accident during morning assembly—my period started unexpectedly and stained my pants. Luigi wrapped his hockey jersey around my waist.


After that, he started leaving coffee and pastries on my desk every morning, with sweet notes tucked in my textbooks.


Young love began blooming in my heart, but I never understood why Luigi would single me out.


I once asked him, ""Why me?""


He said, ""Because you're Aurelia Cooper.""


Teenage love—I had bet my entire seventeenth spring and eighteenth summer on it.


I'd snuck around with him, broken all the rules, given him my V-card, thinking it was the start of something real.


Turns out I was just his practice round.


I gripped the phone so hard my knuckles went white, but the physical pain was nothing compared to my shattered heart.


The shower turned off. I quickly closed the app and put his phone back.


The bathroom door opened and Luigi walked out with just a towel around his waist, water droplets running down his chest and abs.


""Morning, beautiful. You hungry?""


He sat on the bed edge and brushed hair from my face, his eyes lingering on the hickeys covering my neck and collarbone.


Looking at him, all I could think about was how he'd moaned ""Rosalia"" while he was inside me.


""I'm not hungry.""


Luigi noticed my red-rimmed eyes and pulled me against his chest.


""Shit, did I go too hard last night? Look, that was my first time too—I'm still learning the ropes. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? The more we do it, the better I'll get at making you feel good.""


His hands started wandering under my shirt, clearly ready for round two.


I couldn't stand him touching me anymore, knowing I was just his training wheels. I shoved his hands away.


""Don't. I'm sore.""


Luigi withdrew his hands, looking apologetic as he smoothed down my wrinkled shirt.


""You're right, I got carried away. Rest up—I'll grab us some breakfast and maybe take a cold shower while I'm at it.""


After getting dressed, he left the hotel room.


Staring at that crimson stain on the white sheets, I felt completely hollow inside.


For two years of secret dating, I'd hidden from teachers and classmates, bending over backward to make Luigi happy.


When he set his sights on Boston University, I made it my dream school too.


When he wanted to hold hands under our desks during class, I'd blush and intertwine our fingers while pretending to take notes.


When he wanted to make out behind the gym after study hall, I'd sneak out and let him kiss me breathless.


And when he said he wanted to celebrate the end of high school properly, I followed him to this hotel and gave him my V-card.


I thought our epic first love would last forever.


I never expected this betrayal coming.


Since he'd been playing me from day one, planning to trade up to Rosalia all along, I wouldn't follow behind him like a lost puppy either.


I got dressed and left the hotel, finding a pharmacy on the street corner where I awkwardly asked the pharmacist for Plan B.


She looked me up and down with obvious judgment before pulling the box from behind the counter.


""Honey, why didn't your boyfriend use protection? These pills aren't good for young women.""


My face burned with shame and embarrassment.


There had been condoms right there in the hotel nightstand.


Last night I'd tried to get Luigi to use one, but he'd bitten my neck and kept grinding against me，his eyes red with desire.


""Aurelia, come on, those things kill the mood. I'm dying here—just let me feel you, please? I swear I'll pull out.""


But my moment of compromise had led to this bitter pill.


I paid for the Plan B and thanked her.


""This is a one-time thing.""


I would never believe Luigi's bullshit again.


And I wouldn't let him hurt me anymore.


Chapter 2


I hadn't even stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard women behind me talking shit.


""Kids these days have zero self-respect.""


""She looks so innocent, but buying Plan B at eighteen? What a little slut.""


Their words felt like acid being poured over my skin, burning from my face straight down to my soul.


I practically ran to the bus stop, hands shaking as I dry-swallowed the white pill with bottled water.


The water went down wrong and I started choking, coughing so violently that tears poured down my cheeks. Everything hurt—my throat, my chest, my fucking heart.


""Aurelia!""


Luigi came sprinting toward me, panic written all over his face.


""What the hell? Why'd you bail from the hotel? I've been blowing up your phone—are you seriously gonna ghost me after what we did?""


He had the audacity to look wounded, like I was the one being shitty here.


I wanted to scream, to laugh, to do anything but stand there feeling like my chest was caving in.


""I was getting Plan B."" I waved the empty box at him.


His expression shifted, guilt flashing across his features for maybe half a second.


""Shit, you should've told me. I would've handled it. Had me thinking you were having second thoughts or something.""


I was too emotionally drained to fight about this. ""Whatever. It's done.""


Luigi must have noticed I looked like death because he reached for my hand. ""Look, I got carried away last night. Next time I'll be more careful, okay?""


""Tyler's throwing a graduation party at Copper & Flame. We should head over.""


I jerked my hand back like he'd burned me.


""We're not public yet, remember? Better if we show up separately. Don't want people talking.""


Luigi's whole body went rigid. After what felt like forever, he nodded stiffly.


""Yeah... yeah, good point. I'll grab a ride.""


I turned away and got on the first bus that pulled up, not trusting myself to look at him again.


Luigi had sworn we'd go official after graduation. But here we were, days later, and he was chatting up a storm in every group chat except mentioning anything about us.


The truth from his hockey team's messages had made everything crystal clear anyway.


This relationship was never meant to see the light of day.


By the time I made it to Copper & Flame, the private dining room was already packed with our entire graduating class.


And there was Rosalia, dolled up in some frilly pink dress, holding court in the center of the room while Luigi sat right beside her, literally hand-feeding her grapes.


I felt physically sick.


Some of the guys started razzing him: ""Bro, graduation's in like two days. You've been simping for our class princess forever—when you gonna grow some balls and ask her out? College is gonna be a whole different game, man!""


Luigi's obsession with Rosalia was common knowledge to everyone except, apparently, me.


While he was secretly screwing me, he was publicly playing her knight in shining armor—cleaning up after her, buying her lunch, fighting anyone who looked at her wrong.


Hell, he's the one who campaigned to get her voted class beauty in the first place.


We were identical twins. We had the same face, same body, same everything.


When I'd questioned him about it before, his bullshit excuse was:


""Babe, your sister looks just like you but she's fragile, you know? If I don't watch out for her, jealous people might target her. But you're different—you're strong. You have me.""


God, I'd actually bought that garbage. Thought he was being protective because he loved me so much.


Looking back, I wanted to punch my naive teenage self in the face.


I steeled myself and pushed through the door.


Luigi saw me walk in and didn't even have the decency to look guilty. Just kept playing the perfect gentleman with Rosalia.


She immediately bounced over to me, putting on her innocent little sister act.


""Aurelia! Oh my God, where were you last night? You didn't come home and Mom and Dad were freaking out!""


Every head in the room turned toward me, whispers starting immediately.


""Holy shit, staying out all night right after graduation? She definitely got laid.""


""I always thought Aurelia was this total nerd, but turns out she's a closet freak...""


Faced with their gossip, Rosalia looked secretly pleased.


I caught her expression and replied with ice in my voice, ""None of your business.""


I tried to find an empty seat away from the circus, but Rosalia grabbed my arm with fake sisterly concern.


""Don't be weird, sit with me!""


She yanked me toward her with way more force than necessary, and my shirt collar shifted, exposing every single hickey Luigi had sucked into my skin last night.


Rosalia gasped dramatically like she'd just discovered a crime scene. ""Aurelia, what are those marks?!""


The entire room went dead silent, then exploded with whispers.


""No fucking way, look at her neck!""


""Jesus Christ, someone went to town on her. How many are there?""


""Who knew the class nerd was such a slut? Bet she just grabbed some random guy for her graduation fuck.""


Humiliation burned through me as I frantically pulled my shirt back up. My eyes found Luigi automatically, desperately hoping for... what? Support? Acknowledgment?


He was meticulously peeling a fucking orange for Rosalia, acting like I didn't exist.


Something inside me finally snapped.


""It's nothing,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady. ""Got bit by a dog last night. Allergic reaction.""


A heartless, lying piece of shit dog.


Chapter 3


Everyone burst out laughing, making crude jokes about which random street guy the ""dog"" might have been.


Luigi's face went dark, and he slammed his hand on the table. ""Alright, everyone's here. Let's order.""


Once he spoke, nobody dared keep running their mouths. Tyler jumped in to smooth things over.


""He's right. After tonight we'll all be scattered across the country. Let's eat and catch up while we can.""


Everyone started sharing their summer plans—some heading out of state for work, others planning road trips or getting their licenses.


After dinner, we hit up the pool hall next door.


During a game, Rosalia got dared to let one of the guys lift her onto the pool table and spin her around.


The guys started hooting, and Rosalia looked shyly at Luigi. ""Luigi, could you do me a favor?""


Luigi's jaw clenched before he set down his cue stick. Without warning, he grabbed her waist and effortlessly lifted her onto the felt, spinning her in a slow circle.


""Hold on tight,"" he murmured, way too intimate for my comfort.


Rosalia giggled and grabbed his shoulders for support, practically melting into him.


The guys went wild: ""Damn, Luigi! Those hockey muscles aren't just for show!""


Watching this pathetic display, I dug my nails into my palms and forced myself to look away, trying to pretend I didn't exist.


Naturally, the next dare picked me. I had to either take three shots of tequila or make out with one of the guys for thirty seconds.


All the guys were grinning like wolves as I automatically looked toward Luigi.


He was still standing close to Rosalia, deliberately avoiding my eyes.


""I already did my good deed tonight. I'm out.""


His dismissal felt like being gutted with a rusty knife.


Fuck it.


I grabbed the first shot and threw it back, then the second, then the third. The alcohol burned like acid down my throat, and tears streamed down my face before I could stop them.


I barely made it to the bathroom before throwing up everything.


After splashing cold water on my face and rinsing out my mouth, I finally looked in the mirror.


Bloodshot eyes, smeared makeup, hair a disaster, hickeys still visible on my neck. I looked like I'd been hit by a truck.


I tried to fix myself up and forced a smile at my reflection.


""Aurelia, pain makes you stronger. You'll get through this...""


I couldn't go back in there. I texted Tyler that I was heading home and escaped.


On the bus, I opened my phone and scrolled through two years of messages with Luigi.


Aurelia, I'm so into you. Will you be my girlfriend?


Can't sleep again. All I can think about is you. Miss you so much.


There were hundreds of photos too—him showing off on his bike, scoring goals at hockey practice, selfies of us together at school.


I'd transferred all of this to every new phone, treasuring every word and image.


Now, with trembling fingers, I selected all 6.9GB of our history and hit delete.


Two years of love—erased.


Like it never happened. Like we never happened.


When I got home, I barely made it through the front door before Dad's hand connected with my face, sending me sprawling.


""You worthless little slut! Out all night, then coming home reeking of alcohol—have you lost your goddamn mind?""


Half my face exploded in pain. Through watery eyes, I saw Rosalia and Mom on the couch, watching my humiliation like it was entertainment.


""It was just a graduation party,"" I said, tasting blood. ""I barely drank anything and threw it up. Rosalia was there—she can tell you.""


Rosalia's eyes went wide with fake innocence. ""Well, there was a party, but Aurelia disappeared halfway through. I have no idea where she went after that.""


""Graduation was literally five days ago and she's already acting like a complete slut. Do you want the whole neighborhood thinking we raised a whore?""


Her words were gasoline on Dad's rage. Mom's face twisted with disgust.


""Aurelia, we've told you a thousand times to follow your sister's example. If you had an ounce of Rosalia's class, your father wouldn't be losing his mind right now.""


I stayed on the floor, blood dripping from my split lip, my cheek on fire.


Looking at them cuddled together on the couch made me want to vomit again.


A travel brochure on the coffee table caught my eye: Post-Graduation Bali Family Trip for Three.


All three signatures were already there—Dad, Mom, Rosalia.


""You're taking her to Bali? Without me?""


Mom wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Rosalia won this in a contest at school. Only three spots available—naturally we're going with her.""


""You can stay home and think about your choices. Maybe next time there'll be room for you too.""


I laughed, bitter and broken. ""Next time? When the hell is next time?""


Rosalia had been born premature and sickly—doctors blamed me for ""stealing her nutrients"" in the womb. Ever since, Mom and Dad treated her like she was made of glass and me like I was some kind of parasite.


Growing up, every prize I won, every toy I loved, had to be handed over the second Rosalia showed interest.


Dinner was always ""let your sister eat first,"" birthday parties were ""we'll celebrate yours next weekend,"" Christmas presents were ""share with Rosalia, be a good big sister.""


""Next time"" never fucking came.


When Mom stayed silent, Dad raised his hand again.


""Keep running your mouth and see what happens! Get upstairs and don't come down until you've learned some respect!""


I dragged myself to my room, everything inside me screaming.


My phone buzzed with a text from my homeroom teacher.


Aurelia, come in tomorrow morning to go over your scores. We need to talk college applications.


Sure, I typed back, curling into a ball on my bed.


College was my ticket out of this nightmare. My chance to disappear.


The next morning I went straight to school and reviewed my test answers with Mr. Miller.


After calculating my projected scores, he lit up with pride.


""These are incredible, Aurelia. I remember you talking about Boston University—with numbers like these, you could get into any program you want.""


""I've got their admissions packet right here. Take it home and start planning your future.""


His enthusiasm made my chest tight with guilt.


I'd only wanted Boston University because of Luigi. Now I needed to think about saving myself.


""Actually, Mr. Miller, I want to apply to New Mexico Tech's government research program.""


I was going to leave this house I'd been trapped in for eighteen years, and leave Luigi too.


Get as far away from all of them as possible...




The night after our SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card.


In the heat of passion, I couldn't help but let out a soft moan, only to hear him whisper ""Rosalia.""


But my name is Aurelia Cooper, and Rosalia is my twin sister.


I looked at Luigi uncertainly. ""Who did you just call?""


""Aurelia,"" Luigi said without missing a beat, leaning down to kiss my eyelids. ""Getting distracted right now? What, am I not doing this right?""


His movements became more aggressive, wiping away all my doubts.


Luigi was our school's star hockey player—not only skilled in technique but also blessed with seemingly endless stamina.


Wave after wave of sensation hit me as I weakly pushed against his chest.


""Stop... please...""


He pressed his lips to my ear, voice rough. ""Baby, let's try you on top.""


All night long, he had me every which way, flipping me around despite my tears and begging for breaks.


It wasn't until sunrise that he finally rolled off, satisfied, and headed to the shower.


I lay there completely wrecked, feeling like I'd been hit by a truck.


That's when his phone on the nightstand started going off like crazy.


Luigi's phone. I glanced over and saw a Snapchat notification pop up.


Yooo Luigi finally got his dick wet last night!


My stomach dropped. I couldn't help myself—I grabbed his phone and opened Snapchat.


When I scrolled through the group chat with his hockey teammates, I froze in shock.


In the middle of the night, Luigi had actually sent a photo of our bloodstained sheets to the team group chat!


Below the photo was a string of messages—


Tyler_Hockey23: No fucking way bro, you actually banged Aurelia Cooper? Thought you were obsessed with her sister Rosalia?


JakeIce99: Dude you're missing the point. They're identical twins—same face, same body. Luigi's just using Aurelia for target practice, you know? Getting his technique down before he goes after Rosalia so he doesn't mess it up with his real crush.


Marcus_Puck: Smart move. Rosalia's wifey material. Better to break in that virgin dick on the practice dummy first, then he'll know how to treat a queen right...


BradSticks: Bet Aurelia was tight as fuck though. Lucky bastard.


Tyler_Hockey23: Think she knows she's just the warm-up act? ?


Each disgusting message felt like a knife to my chest, leaving me completely numb.


I'd imagined a million reasons why Luigi might want me, but never this.


Luigi wasn't just our hockey captain—he was Mr. Popular, friends with everyone. Meanwhile, I was the quiet nerd that teachers loved and most students ignored.


Our personalities were completely different who should never have crossed paths.


But during sophomore year, I had an accident during morning assembly—my period started unexpectedly and stained my pants. Luigi wrapped his hockey jersey around my waist.


After that, he started leaving coffee and pastries on my desk every morning, with sweet notes tucked in my textbooks.


Young love began blooming in my heart, but I never understood why Luigi would single me out.


I once asked him, ""Why me?""


He said, ""Because you're Aurelia Cooper.""


Teenage love—I had bet my entire seventeenth spring and eighteenth summer on it.


I'd snuck around with him, broken all the rules, given him my V-card, thinking it was the start of something real.


Turns out I was just his practice round.


I gripped the phone so hard my knuckles went white, but the physical pain was nothing compared to my shattered heart.


The shower turned off. I quickly closed the app and put his phone back.


The bathroom door opened and Luigi walked out with just a towel around his waist, water droplets running down his chest and abs.


""Morning, beautiful. You hungry?""


He sat on the bed edge and brushed hair from my face, his eyes lingering on the hickeys covering my neck and collarbone.


Looking at him, all I could think about was how he'd moaned ""Rosalia"" while he was inside me.


""I'm not hungry.""


Luigi noticed my red-rimmed eyes and pulled me against his chest.


""Shit, did I go too hard last night? Look, that was my first time too—I'm still learning the ropes. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? The more we do it, the better I'll get at making you feel good.""


His hands started wandering under my shirt, clearly ready for round two.


I couldn't stand him touching me anymore, knowing I was just his training wheels. I shoved his hands away.


""Don't. I'm sore.""


Luigi withdrew his hands, looking apologetic as he smoothed down my wrinkled shirt.


""You're right, I got carried away. Rest up—I'll grab us some breakfast and maybe take a cold shower while I'm at it.""


After getting dressed, he left the hotel room.


Staring at that crimson stain on the white sheets, I felt completely hollow inside.


For two years of secret dating, I'd hidden from teachers and classmates, bending over backward to make Luigi happy.


When he set his sights on Boston University, I made it my dream school too.


When he wanted to hold hands under our desks during class, I'd blush and intertwine our fingers while pretending to take notes.


When he wanted to make out behind the gym after study hall, I'd sneak out and let him kiss me breathless.


And when he said he wanted to celebrate the end of high school properly, I followed him to this hotel and gave him my V-card.


I thought our epic first love would last forever.


I never expected this betrayal coming.


Since he'd been playing me from day one, planning to trade up to Rosalia all along, I wouldn't follow behind him like a lost puppy either.


I got dressed and left the hotel, finding a pharmacy on the street corner where I awkwardly asked the pharmacist for Plan B.


She looked me up and down with obvious judgment before pulling the box from behind the counter.


""Honey, why didn't your boyfriend use protection? These pills aren't good for young women.""


My face burned with shame and embarrassment.


There had been condoms right there in the hotel nightstand.


Last night I'd tried to get Luigi to use one, but he'd bitten my neck and kept grinding against me，his eyes red with desire.


""Aurelia, come on, those things kill the mood. I'm dying here—just let me feel you, please? I swear I'll pull out.""


But my moment of compromise had led to this bitter pill.


I paid for the Plan B and thanked her.


""This is a one-time thing.""


I would never believe Luigi's bullshit again.


And I wouldn't let him hurt me anymore.


Chapter 2


I hadn't even stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard women behind me talking shit.


""Kids these days have zero self-respect.""


""She looks so innocent, but buying Plan B at eighteen? What a little slut.""


Their words felt like acid being poured over my skin, burning from my face straight down to my soul.


I practically ran to the bus stop, hands shaking as I dry-swallowed the white pill with bottled water.


The water went down wrong and I started choking, coughing so violently that tears poured down my cheeks. Everything hurt—my throat, my chest, my fucking heart.


""Aurelia!""


Luigi came sprinting toward me, panic written all over his face.


""What the hell? Why'd you bail from the hotel? I've been blowing up your phone—are you seriously gonna ghost me after what we did?""


He had the audacity to look wounded, like I was the one being shitty here.


I wanted to scream, to laugh, to do anything but stand there feeling like my chest was caving in.


""I was getting Plan B."" I waved the empty box at him.


His expression shifted, guilt flashing across his features for maybe half a second.


""Shit, you should've told me. I would've handled it. Had me thinking you were having second thoughts or something.""


I was too emotionally drained to fight about this. ""Whatever. It's done.""


Luigi must have noticed I looked like death because he reached for my hand. ""Look, I got carried away last night. Next time I'll be more careful, okay?""


""Tyler's throwing a graduation party at Copper & Flame. We should head over.""


I jerked my hand back like he'd burned me.


""We're not public yet, remember? Better if we show up separately. Don't want people talking.""


Luigi's whole body went rigid. After what felt like forever, he nodded stiffly.


""Yeah... yeah, good point. I'll grab a ride.""


I turned away and got on the first bus that pulled up, not trusting myself to look at him again.


Luigi had sworn we'd go official after graduation. But here we were, days later, and he was chatting up a storm in every group chat except mentioning anything about us.


The truth from his hockey team's messages had made everything crystal clear anyway.


This relationship was never meant to see the light of day.


By the time I made it to Copper & Flame, the private dining room was already packed with our entire graduating class.


And there was Rosalia, dolled up in some frilly pink dress, holding court in the center of the room while Luigi sat right beside her, literally hand-feeding her grapes.


I felt physically sick.


Some of the guys started razzing him: ""Bro, graduation's in like two days. You've been simping for our class princess forever—when you gonna grow some balls and ask her out? College is gonna be a whole different game, man!""


Luigi's obsession with Rosalia was common knowledge to everyone except, apparently, me.


While he was secretly screwing me, he was publicly playing her knight in shining armor—cleaning up after her, buying her lunch, fighting anyone who looked at her wrong.


Hell, he's the one who campaigned to get her voted class beauty in the first place.


We were identical twins. We had the same face, same body, same everything.


When I'd questioned him about it before, his bullshit excuse was:


""Babe, your sister looks just like you but she's fragile, you know? If I don't watch out for her, jealous people might target her. But you're different—you're strong. You have me.""


God, I'd actually bought that garbage. Thought he was being protective because he loved me so much.


Looking back, I wanted to punch my naive teenage self in the face.


I steeled myself and pushed through the door.

She immediately bounced over to me, putting on her innocent little sister act.


""Aurelia! Oh my God, where were you last night? You didn't come home and Mom and Dad were freaking out!""


Every head in the room turned toward me, whispers starting immediately.

""I always thought Aurelia was this total nerd, but turns out she's a closet freak...""

She yanked me toward her with way more force than necessary, and my shirt collar shifted, exposing every single hickey Luigi had sucked into my skin last night.


Rosalia gasped dramatically like she'd just discovered a crime scene. ""Aurelia, what are those marks?!""


The entire room went dead silent, then exploded with whispers.


""No fucking way, look at her neck!""


""Jesus Christ, someone went to town on her. How many are there?""


""Who knew the class nerd was such a slut? Bet she just grabbed some random guy for her graduation fuck.""


Humiliation burned through me as I frantically pulled my shirt back up. My eyes found Luigi automatically, desperately hoping for... what? Support? Acknowledgment?


He was meticulously peeling a fucking orange for Rosalia, acting like I didn't exist.


Something inside me finally snapped.


""It's nothing,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady. ""Got bit by a dog last night. Allergic reaction.""


A heartless, lying piece of shit dog.

Everyone burst out laughing, making crude jokes about which random street guy the ""dog"" might have been.

Get as far away from all of them as possible...

Chapter 1

When I returned to the pack, with a carefully prepared gift for Sebastian, the pack house was empty. Only a table full of fresh flowers sat there.

Cheers and laughter drifted in from the garden as I walked step by step toward the sound.

“Alpha Sebastian, you’re so lucky! Your son is handsome, and your Luna is so beautiful.”

I froze at the sound of a man’s teasing voice from not far away.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

As I took another step forward, I finally saw Sebastian.

He was holding a baby in his arms, and a petite she-wolf was clinging to his side, her arm wrapped around his.

“Yeah, I’m definitely lucky. But the most important thing is, it’s all thanks to Emery,” he said softly, his eyes full of tenderness as he ruffled the she-wolf’s hair.

She giggled, covering her mouth, and her eyes were full of happiness.

A family of three looking so enviable, so perfect.

I stood there frozen, feeling like a mouse sneaking a peek at them.

Behind them, on the wall, hung a banner:
“Archer’s Baby Shower”

Archer…

Once, I had cuddled up to Sebastian, smiling sweetly at him as I said, “Sebastian, one day I want to give you a son, and we’ll name him Archer.”

He asked me why, and I grinned brightly. “Archer. I hope our child will be an amazing archer, a great warrior.”

And now, he had named the child of someone else and him Archer.

“By the way, Sebastian, Harper should be coming back to the pack soon, right? Aren’t you worried she’ll cause a scene when she finds out you’re a dad?” one of Sebastian’s friends asked.

But he just gently stroked the baby’s face in his arms. “I almost forgot, thanks for the reminder.”

With that, he immediately dialed a number and told the person on the other end of the line, “Tell Harper to stay in the North for a while longer. Don’t let her come back yet. Otherwise, if she finds out I have a son, she’ll definitely make a scene.”

My breath caught in my throat, and I took a step back.

Three years ago, it was Sebastian who had asked me to become a healer. He thought my personality was too wild—I would cry whenever something happened, and I would make a scene if I saw him with other she-wolves.

He had said to me then, “It’s not that I don’t like you, but your personality is too unstable. You’re not suited to be my Luna.”

“How about this,” he’d continued, “You become a healer for three years. It’ll help you temper your heart, and once you’ve gained some emotional stability, you’ll be ready to return as the Luna of mine and the pack.”

I believed him, so I worked hard, studied, and became a healer. I applied to join the battlefield rescue team at the Northern Border.

The day my application was accepted, I was over the moon.

I thought, if I could just make it through these three years, I could finally be Sebastian’s Luna.

But now, I had returned to find him a father.

When I came back to my senses, my face was already wet with tears, and the more I wiped them away, the more flowed.

“I really don’t want her to come back,” he had said.

⸻

Chapter 2

Sebastian lazily spoke, freeing one hand to intertwine his fingers with the she-wolf beside him.

“From now on, I just want to be with Emery, to be happy together for the rest of our lives.”

“How lucky you are! I want my mate to give me children, too!” someone cheered.

The others joined in the celebration.

“Then Sebastian, have you thought about how you’re going to explain this to Harper?” someone asked.

At the mention of my name, his expression quickly turned cold.

“I haven’t thought about bringing her back,” he said, lowering his head to comfort the she-wolf beside him.

“My beta will take care of everything, don’t worry. The only one by my side will be you.”

Suddenly, snowflakes began to fall from the sky, landing on my nose and freezing my heart.

Three years ago, on the day I left, I had grabbed Sebastian and asked him, “Sebastian, when I come back, will you really seal the mate bond with me and make me your Luna?”

He had ruffled my hair, his voice gentle, like a flowing stream. “Of course. By then, you’ll be much more mature.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll wait for you. The only one by my side will be you.”

But now, I had matured, and he was with another she-wolf.

Why?

Why did he lie to me?

My wolf let out a pained whimper, and my chest tightened with pain. Tears fell uncontrollably.

As I treated the wounded on the Northern Border, with artillery fire all around, I had kept thinking,
I have to survive. I have to survive so I can have the mating ceremony with Sebastian.

I had applied to return to the pack a year early, and today I finally came back. I had planned to surprise Sebastian, but he had already given me one.

“I heard Sebastian bought a cruise ship to hold the mating ceremony with Emery.”

I overheard someone talking and quickly hid behind a tree.

“Oh my God, that sounds amazing. I feel envious. But what about Harper? Isn’t she Sebastian’s fated mate? She loves Alpha the most.”

“Don’t you know? Three years ago, Sebastian tricked her into going to the Northern Border to become a healer. Whether she even makes it back alive is uncertain.”

“Sebastian just wants to be with Emery, but he’s afraid she’ll make a scene, so he’s doing this.”

“As soon as she left the pack and got to the Northern Border, Sebastian immediately got together with Emery.”

Their words were so clear, ringing in my ears.

So, Sebastian had planned this three years ago, while I had foolishly believed his words.

In such harsh conditions on the Northern Border, I never felt it was too hard because I thought if I just got through this, I’d return and be able to seal the mate bond with him.

These people walked away to offer their congratulations to Sebastian.

Suddenly, someone teased, “Sebastian, Harper is your mate. She’s loved you for so many years. Are you really willing to let her stay in such harsh conditions on the border as a healer?”

Sebastian didn’t even lift his eyelids, his eyes still fixed on his son.

“She’s the one who likes me, not the other way around.”

“If it weren’t for the fact that she’s the she-wolf my father adopted, and he really likes her, I would’ve cut ties with her a long time ago.”

“You all know, she’s seven years younger than me. I can’t possibly like her.”

“She’s been the one pestering me all these years.”

I was adopted by the Bluemoon Pack when I was 16, just barely coming of age.

At that time, Sebastian was already 23 and preparing to take on the role of the pack’s Alpha.

He was the heir to the pack, handsome, tall, and strong. So many she-wolves surrounded him, hoping to become his mate.

I would get jealous every time and find him to say, “Sebastian, can you not be so close with the other she-wolves?”

He would just laugh then, ruffle my face, and say, “Harper, I’ll do whatever you say.”

Chapter 3

When I was a teenager, I thought this was love.

I tried so hard to get closer to him, to understand his likes and dislikes, to become the person he would want.

At 18, I wore my first sexy dress and high heels.

At the mate gathering, just a future Alpha from another pack spoke to me for just a few moments, and Sebastian immediately pulled me into a corner and kissed me forcefully.

Under the messy strands of hair, his eyes flickered with the wolf’s shadow.

He pressed his forehead against mine and whispered, “You’re mine.”

At the start, it was always him giving me hope.

He acted like he liked me in every possible way.

But now, he said I had been the one bothering him.

I left in disappointment, unable to hold back my tears by the time I reached the door.

Shaking, I took out my phone and checked the latest message from Sebastian:
“Harper, happy birthday.”

When he sent the message, I was in the middle of saving a pregnant woman, covered in blood, having gone without sleep for a whole day and night.

But seeing his message, I felt re-energized.

Wiping away my tears, I tapped the voice call button and dialed him.

“Harper, what’s wrong?”

Sebastian’s voice was as gentle as ever.

He must have found a quiet place to take the call, since it had taken a while for him to pick up.

I wanted to speak, but my mind kept replaying the image of him holding a child and standing with another she-wolf.

“Harper bear?”

He called me that again.

He had always called me “Harper bear,” and I had once loved the nickname.

But now, it suddenly made me feel disgusted.

“Sebastian, I’m back at the pack.”

If he listened closely, he could hear the slight tremor in my voice.

But Sebastian didn’t seem to notice the difference.

He paused for a moment before asking, “Why did you come back?”

“Where are you now? I’ll come pick you up.”

To be honest, my heart had already shattered when I saw that scene in the garden of the pack house.

But now, he was speaking so gently.

“I’m at the pack house’s door.”

I replied softly.

This pack house had been a gift from Sebastian when I turned 18.

He had said to me then, “Harper, no matter who you’re with in the future, this house will always be yours because this will always be your home.”

“My people must have confidence.”

But now, he was living in this house with another she-wolf, and they had a child.

By the time Sebastian came out, I had already composed myself.

He stepped through the snow, walking toward me, his gaze filled with concern.

When he reached me, he immediately pulled me into his embrace, his warm breath tickling my ear.

“Harper bear, it’s been three years. You’ve lost weight.”

A peach-scented fragrance filled the air.

His scent had changed.

It used to be a light vanilla aroma.

I recoiled from his touch and pushed him away.

His pupils constricted for a second, then he smiled.

“Harper, you’ve grown up. Now you understand the differences between men and women.”

“But I’m still your future mate. Please don’t be distant with me, okay?”

He used to be the light in my life.

The reason I said this was because when I first joined the pack, I was very introverted.

I was often bullied at school, and once, after school, I was cornered by other pack members in an alley.

It was then that Sebastian suddenly appeared.

He drove a Maybach, cornered the bullies, then got out of the car and pulled me behind him.

I’d never forget the cold way he spoke to them,
“Harper is my sister. If anyone dares to bully her again, I won’t let you get away with it.”

⸻

Chapter 4

But now, I felt like he was a stranger.

His face was exactly the same as before, but I no longer felt that same flutter in my heart.

Sebastian reached out and touched my face, and I noticed the ring on his ring finger.

It hadn’t been there before.

“I’m tired. Can I go back to the pack house to rest first?”

I shifted my gaze and focused on his face, watching as panic flickered in his eyes.

“Okay… sure.”

“But today the pack is holding a baby shower after party. A friend of mine, also one of our pack members, has become a father, but there was no place to hold the baby shower for his child, so they came to our house.”

“You don’t mind, do you?”

Before, I thought of him as my guardian. Every time I was hurt, he would show up just in time.

Whenever I wasn’t feeling well, he would calmly take care of me.

One winter, we went out together to buy fireworks and witnessed a couple arguing.

The cause was the man had deceived the woman and was seeing another girl.

At the time, he told me, “Harper, keep your eyes peeled when choosing your mate in the future. You should find someone like me, the gold standard.”

“I’ll never lie to you.”

But now, all he spoke were lies.

Maybe because I had really become more mature, I didn’t want to expose him.

I wanted to see just how long he could keep deceiving me.

“I don’t mind.”

When Sebastian heard this, he smiled. He tried to pull me closer, but I dodged him.

A flicker of surprise passed through his eyes, but then he gave a self-assuring smile.

“You’ve grown distant with me now.”

“It’s okay. I’ll stay by your side and help you become the way you were before.”

But in my heart, I knew too well I could never go back to how things were.

Three years ago, he had tricked me into going to the battlefield in Northern Border to become a healer.

I had seen too much death and loss. I had watched a little girl smile at me one moment, and the next, she turned into a cold, lifeless body.

At that time, I realized I had to learn to cherish time.

Because one never knew which would come first—tomorrow or an unexpected accident.

So now, I didn’t want to waste my time on someone who didn’t deserve it.

Sebastian didn’t take me to the master bedroom where I used to sleep. Instead, he led me to the guest room.

He explained, “It’s not convenient because of the baby, so he’s temporarily staying in the master bedroom.”

“Once things settle down in a few days, I’ll have the maid thoroughly clean the room. Would you be okay with staying then?”

“Okay.”

I set my bag down.

He looked at me for a few seconds before adding, “I guess you and I don’t like noisy scenes. You rest here, and I’ll go handle some things.”

After Sebastian left, I took a stone from my pocket, one with the English engraving: “Peace and Joy.”

It had been given to me by a little boy while I was assisting at the Northern Border.

At the time, his parents had passed, and he was all alone.

He handed me the stone with his dark hand and said,
“Doctor, this is for you. You can give it to your beloved mate and wish him safety.”

I had accepted it and was about to get up to get him some candy when, in the next second, he was shot in the head and collapsed in front of me.

I had cried hysterically, wanting to save him, but the other healers took me away.

Coming back to the present, I opened the door to the guest room and took a careful look at the pack house.

In my excitement, I had forgotten to observe earlier.

There were signs of another she-wolf in the house.

In the bathroom, there were women’s towels and skincare products.

On the coffee table, there were flowers, a baby bottle, and children’s toys.

⸻

Chapter 5

After watching all that, I walked toward the master bedroom.

I had once lived here, and Sebastian had decorated it according to my preferences back then.

Just as my hand touched the doorknob, a woman’s voice interrupted me.

“Are you Harper?”

I turned around to see the she-wolf Sebastian had called Emery standing behind me.

She was a bit fuller-figured, wearing a loose dress, but her eyes were beautiful—large and bright, looking very kind.

“I am.”

When I used to work as a healer, many people would ask if I was Harper.

I would always respond firmly that I was, and I guess that became a habit of mine.

She looked me up and down, then suddenly sneered.

“Sebastian hasn’t told you, has he? I’m his future Luna.”

“We already have a son.”

A sharp pain flared in my chest, but I was able to hide my emotions now.

“I know.”

“Then why are you back if you have known?” she asked, glaring at me.

“This is no longer your home. You’re just an outsider.”

She lunged at me, trying to hit me, but I caught her wrist.

“You just had a baby, don’t let your emotions run high, it’s not good for your health.”

At my words, shock flashed in her eyes.

For some reason, I couldn’t bring myself to hate her.

Because I realized she wasn’t at fault. She was just afraid I would steal the person she loved.

“Don’t worry. Although Sebastian and I are fated mates and we promised to seal the mate bond once I come back, now that he has a child, I… won’t bother him anymore.”

As soon as I finished speaking, she suddenly shoved me away with all her strength and collapsed onto the floor.

“I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have taken Sebastian away.”

“Harper, what are you doing?”

Sebastian’s voice came from behind me, and then I felt my body being violently shoved.

The next thing I knew, my face stung from a slap.

Everything around me spun, and Sebastian’s figure appeared hazy in front of me.

His voice, however, was loud and clear in my ears.

“Emery is my future Luna, so what? We have a son, so what?”

“She’s kind and graceful, unlike you, who only knows how to cry and make a scene, even using such tricks to bully others.”

“Harper, you really disgust me.”

“I’m giving you three seconds. Apologize to Emery right now.”

As my vision cleared, I saw Sebastian standing with Emery, holding her tightly in front of me.

His eyes were cold, filled with disdain for me.

Below, other pack members were watching us, gossiping.

“Damn, Harper actually came back.”

“She’s changed so much—her hair’s longer, and she’s slimmer now.”

“Why does she feel so different? She doesn’t look like the same immature girl anymore.”

In the Northern Border, I had once been shot in the leg.

Because we had run out of antibiotics, I faced a great risk of death.

But I remembered the herbal remedies from medical books and treated myself.

At the time, I thought if Sebastian heard about this, he’d think I was brave.

But now, he wasn’t the Sebastian I once loved.

During breaks, I would pull out a picture of Sebastian from my bag and look at it.

The other healers would joke, “Harper, you’re always so calm in the face of everything. The guy you like must be really great, right?”

Yes, I liked Sebastian because of how amazing he was.

I admired his confidence when facing other Alphas, his calmness in handling things, and his bravery in front of other pack members.

I had learned so much from him, and he had always guided me forward.

But now…

At that moment, I truly realized I no longer liked Sebastian.

“I didn’t push her,” I said to Sebastian.

“She fell on her own.”

“Do you think I’ll believe that? I saw it with my own eyes!” Sebastian snapped angrily.

“I know you found out about me and Emery having a child, so now you’re breaking down, right?”

“Harper, do you know why I don’t like you? Because I hate how vile and disgusting you are!”

I suddenly laughed.

“Sebastian, do you know how many children there are in the disaster-stricken packs and how many people there need us healers to save them?”

“I really regret coming back to the pack for you.”

“My time should have been spent on more important things.”

With that, I turned and left.

This time, I didn’t shed a single tear for him.

The girl who once wept quietly behind him had finally grown up.

And now, I’m leaving—for good.

1mepfv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificFrontiers/comments/1mepfv1/k_future_human_underwater_city_residences/,K. Future Human Underwater City Residences,"Abstract:

The vast oceans covering Earth's surface hold immense potential for future human survival and development.

Given the increasing saturation and challenges faced by terrestrial resources, this paper proposes an innovative future human habitation model: underwater city residences based on mobile habitat modules.

This concept leverages infinite energy, Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), and advanced material structural transformation technology to construct a self-sufficient, infinitely expandable, and highly customizable deep-sea living system.

This paper elaborates on the design philosophy and implementation pathways of mobile habitat modules in aspects such as life support, energy circulation, environmental management, intelligent services, and multi-functional modular assembly.

Through specific examples of habitat modules, it demonstrates the ultimate comfort and convenience of future deep-sea living.

This model not only provides vast new habitats for global population growth but also, under the principles of peace and symbiosis, promotes sustainable resource utilization, mitigates surface risks, and is expected to unleash the infinite potential of human thought, ushering in a new deep-sea era that transcends terrestrial civilization.

Introduction:

Earth, often referred to as the ""Water Planet,"" has approximately 71% of its surface covered by vast oceans, with land accounting for only about 29%.

For a long time, the development of human civilization has primarily concentrated on limited terrestrial spaces, leading to increasingly strained resources, scarce developable areas, and even triggering numerous disputes and conflicts.

Currently, global population continues to grow, and the demand for living space, resource supply, and survival security is becoming increasingly urgent, further highlighting the limitations of traditional terrestrial civilization.

In the foreseeable future, human society urgently needs to explore new frontiers of existence to address increasingly severe challenges and pave the way for the continuous prosperity of civilization.

This paper aims to explore a forward-looking solution: expanding human living space to the vast and underexploited deep sea.

The ocean not only possesses an area far exceeding that of land but also harbors abundant undeveloped resources and unique ecological environments, offering infinite possibilities for humanity.

With the discovery of infinite energy, the infinite supply of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) labor, and the support of the Universal Material Structural Transformation Law, deep-sea living will no longer be a science fiction concept but an attainable future reality.

We believe that a civilization built on peace and cooperation will be able to maximize the ocean's potential, achieving wonders beyond what terrestrial civilization can accomplish.

The core of this research lies in proposing and detailing Future Human Underwater City Residences—a system based on highly modular, mobile habitat modules.

These modules will integrate the most advanced life support, energy management, intelligent services, and personalized customization functions, aiming to provide humans with an ultimately comfortable, safe, and sustainable living experience in the deep-sea environment.

This paper will delve into the design philosophy, key technologies, functional modules of mobile habitat modules, and their profound impact on future human society, the ecological environment, and cognitive development.

It envisions a new civilization paradigm where humanity makes the ocean its home, with immense material abundance and infinite wisdom emerging.

Main Body:

Future Human Underwater City Residences.

Underwater Human Residence Mobile Habitat Modules.

Earth is a sphere, and its land area is smaller than its ocean area. Earth is an approximate sphere (more precisely, an ""oblate spheroid slightly bulging at the equator""), and its land area is smaller than its ocean area; this is one of Earth's most fundamental geographical characteristics.

The following are accurate data (as of Earth measurements in 2024):

Earth's total surface area: approximately 510 million square kilometers.

Ocean area: approximately 361 million square kilometers (about 71%).

Land area: approximately 149 million square kilometers (about 29%).

In other words, about 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, and only about 30% is land.

This distribution leads to Earth also being called the ""Water Planet,"" and it is a crucial condition for the nurturing and proliferation of life.

The area of the high seas is greater than the total land area of all countries worldwide, making it humanity's largest remaining pristine land, and the place where miracles transcending terrestrial ones will emerge in the future.

Future humans will discover that the greater the period of peace and civilization, the greater the power.

In the future, a tripartite mobile palace super-residence will emerge, encompassing land, sea, and air. After the infinite discovery of infinite energy, everything else becomes foundational.

Earth's inherent resources plus infinite solar energy resources plus ASI infinite labor resources plus the transformation of time equals all Earth resources being constructible, governed by the Earth Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law.

The resources of the solar system where humanity resides plus ASI infinite labor resources plus AOC super cybernetic human civilization resources plus the transformation of time equals all solar system resources being constructible, governed by the Solar System Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law.

In the next 200 years, money will gradually disappear from the human world, and all super materials/resources will be free.

Inehaustible abundant materials/resources will be available because the super abundant supply of all things, combined with the labor of super intelligent robots and the infinite resources inherent in the universe itself, can be combined within this solar system to supply everything needed for at least 100 billion humans and 10 trillion robots.

Fully equipped, completely adaptable to underwater environments, mobile human living residences, whether they are 7 rooms and 7 halls, or 99 rooms and 99 halls, rooms can be infinitely expanded at will, etc. Rooms can be infinitely and fully automatically combined, spliced, and assembled.

The oxygen supply system is provided by hundreds of plant species growing fully automatically.

Various nutrients in the air and various systems are fully automatically detected and supplied.

ASI super intelligence is responsible for all fully automated living systems of the underwater residence.

The super-large glass of the rooms, electronically controlled, serves as both a curtain for shielding and a transparent glass to view the underwater world.

It also functions as a super-large electronic screen, providing a superb viewing experience for videos and movies.

A small underwater submarine is embedded within the large residence.

By taking the small submarine, one can leave the large residence and enter deep-sea areas thousands of meters deep for exploration and recreation.

The large residence can move freely at depths within 1000 meters; exceeding 1000 meters requires entering the small submarine for exploration and recreation.

This underwater residence is designed for long-term daily living. Inside the residence are various systems and robotic equipment, as well as many ASI super robots living with humans underwater. The oxygen supply system is divided into three sets.

The first oxygen system, the most commonly used, is the comprehensive plant-based oxygen supply system cultivated fully automatically by robots.

The second oxygen system is a fully automated oxygen cylinder supply system within the underwater residence. The oxygen in these cylinders can supply all occupants of the room for one month.

This oxygen is a backup supply; when the plant-based oxygen supply system encounters issues, the system automatically detects and supplements oxygen.

These oxygen cylinders can automatically leave the underwater room, ascend to the sea surface to absorb oxygen, and after absorbing oxygen, automatically return to the seabed and enter their storage position.

The third oxygen system consists of temporary oxygen cylinders carried by robots.

Robots will always accompany humans. In emergencies such as fire, all robots will analyze the location of all humans within one second and swiftly complete the task of supplying temporary oxygen cylinders to humans.

Robots also serve as treatment doctors for emergencies.

The underwater habitat module residence is also equipped with a seawater energy conversion to electricity system, providing infinite power.

Seawater desalination can supply daily plant irrigation and robot room cleaning, etc.

Drinking water is no longer ordinary fresh water but super-nutritious water carried by the habitat module, which can supply for one month.

There is also backup fresh water. One week before the fresh water is almost used up, robots detect the need for replenishment and will automatically go out to replenish fresh water and all other daily necessities.

Plant-based fresh water resources are the most consumed water resource for humans living underwater.

In the future, human editing and decoding of plants will be commonplace, such as genetically modifying small plants to become large, and large plants to become small, as well as inter-plant genetic modification and infinite grafting technologies, etc.

Your Plant Habitat Module room has over 100 types of plants that can produce daily drinking water.

Any excess drinking water, fruits, or plant leaves produced by these plants will be automatically collected, sorted, digested, decomposed, and recycled by robots.

A portion will be used for plant growth soil cultivation.

In the living areas of the habitat module, humans will be supplied daily with a large number of fresh flowers and potted plants in a circulating manner.

The air will be filled with fragrance.

In the future, there will be no waste; all material energy can be converted, decomposed, and reused.

The human underwater living habitat module is assembled by combining and splicing different functional rooms.

There are thousands of independent habitat modules available for splicing.

All habitat modules come in large, medium, and small sizes.

Many habitat modules are not needed at all times, such as the hair salon module, party module, etc.

These habitat modules require advance booking. At your reserved time, these habitat modules will be delivered precisely to your location.

Upon arrival, they will automatically dock with your habitat module.

Once docked, air circulation will be connected, allowing people to move freely between them.

When your reserved time ends, the habitat module will first seal itself off. It will then automatically disconnect from your habitat module.

After successful separation, the habitat module will automatically depart and return to its designated area, where robots will perform fully automated cleaning, maintenance, and upkeep, then await the next booking to continue serving humanity and fulfilling the unique mission of each independent habitat module.

Each habitat module is an independent ecological functional unit, supporting modular splicing, environmental management, intelligent linkage, energy supply, AI coordinated supervision, material circulation supply, and so on.

There are also many large comprehensive habitat modules; almost ten large modules combined can possess 1000 functions, sufficient to meet daily human needs.

In reality, for humans today, the future will provide super satisfaction in every aspect.

The modularity of the habitat module system is not merely a design choice but a fundamental principle for the resilience, adaptability, and evolutionary development of the deep-sea city.

It allows specialized environments to be perfected and interconnected, thereby creating a whole that far exceeds the sum of its parts.

In extreme and potentially dangerous environments, the ability to isolate, repair, upgrade, or reconfigure parts of a habitat without compromising the entire system is crucial. Modular design achieves this.

Furthermore, as technology evolves over centuries, new modules with new functionalities can be integrated, allowing the city to adapt and develop organically.

This also permits the existence of diverse environments, meeting the multifaceted needs of a complex society.

In the deep-sea environment, it is possible to effectively avoid threats such as surface nuclear weapon attacks and asteroid impacts on Earth.

Before 2050, many initial habitat modules will be tested in the high seas. Before 2070, a massive human residential community will form in the high seas.

By 2070, many types and functional combinations of habitat modules will have been upgraded. After 2100, habitat modules will be mass-produced, and by 2100, over 100 million people will have chosen to reside in the high seas.

Conclusion:

This paper has deeply explored the possibility and necessity of establishing underwater city residences for future humanity in Earth's vast oceans, and has detailed the innovative living model centered on mobile habitat modules.

From a philosophical perspective, this vision represents a shift in human civilization from the struggle over limited terrestrial resources to the peaceful development and symbiosis with the infinite potential of the ocean.

It transcends the limitations of traditional geographical boundaries, foreshadowing a new social paradigm where ""money disappears,"" materials are immensely abundant, and all things can be transformed and reused, in which human ""super satisfaction"" will become the norm.

The unique tranquility and transcendental environment of the deep sea are endowed with the philosophical value of inspiring ""miraculous thoughts"" and nurturing ""top-tier super-intelligent humans,"" providing an unprecedented fertile ground for the ascent of human spirit and intellect.

From a theoretical perspective, the modular design of mobile habitat modules is not merely a technical choice but a fundamental principle for the resilience, adaptability, and continuous evolution of the deep-sea city.

It ensures the ability to isolate, repair, upgrade, and reconfigure habitats in extreme environments, thereby constructing an organic whole that far exceeds the sum of its parts.

Combined with the ""Earth Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law"" and the ""Solar System Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law,"" the synergistic effect of infinite energy and Artificial Super Intelligence makes an inexhaustible supply of materials possible, providing a solid foundation for the survival of 100 billion humans and 10 trillion robots in the future.

This design philosophy provides a theoretical framework for future large-scale, highly complex life support systems.

Looking ahead to application prospects, underwater city residences will provide humanity with a safe, luxurious, and sustainable habitat, effectively mitigating potential threats such as surface nuclear weapon attacks and asteroid impacts.

Its complete life support systems (multiple oxygen sources, nutritious fresh water), infinite energy supply, intelligent environmental management, and highly personalized multi-functional habitat modules (such as Super Kitchen, Beauty and Massage, Plant Habitat Module, Emotional Companionship, etc.) will redefine the quality of human life.

From the preliminary tests in 2050 to over 100 million people choosing to reside in the high seas by 2100, this development roadmap clearly depicts humanity's grand stride towards an ocean civilization.

In the future, underwater cities will become a key milestone in the evolution of human civilization, ushering in a new era of harmonious coexistence with the ocean, highly advanced technology, and infinitely emerging wisdom.

100 Global Unfinished Missions

I am an original content creator, dedicated to deep thinking and systematic expression. I possess a continuous stream of original knowledge and theoretical innovation.

I am passionate about recording and writing down these ideas—not only as a personal enthusiasm, but as the very core of my daily work.

Within my area of expertise—original theory and content creation—I perform with excellence.

However, I am also aware that for these original ideas to realize their greater value, individual effort alone is not enough.

The publishing, dissemination, transformation, operation, and collaboration of content are not my strong suits. I should not devote my time to the areas where I am least effective, but rather focus on where I excel the most.

Therefore, I sincerely invite like-minded collaborators from around the world to participate in this grand and meaningful project of original knowledge creation.

I am looking for the following collaborators:

1、Knowledge-based influencers, independent media creators, and intellectual organizations worldwide I hope to establish partnerships with you to jointly publish, interpret, and spread original theories, and to build true content influence grounded in intellectual depth.

2、Professional teams for text-to-video transformation I welcome collaborations with skilled teams in video editing, voiceover, animation, and other production areas, to transform written content into high-quality short videos that bring knowledge to life for the broader public.

3、Book publishing institutions or editorial teams I am looking for partners who can help systematize and publish my original works in book form. My goal is not merely to publish a single volume, but to construct a comprehensive intellectual system and promote a sustainable body of original theory. This includes co-authoring publications with top 100 globally recognized authors.

4、Website architects and digital platform developers I aim to build a dedicated, professional website to publish content, showcase theories, and run a knowledge-based community. I welcome collaboration with website architects, UI designers, and developers to co-create this digital infrastructure.

5、Global game development and creative teams Some of my original theories possess strong interactivity and world-building potential, making them well-suited for strategic or narrative-driven games. I invite global game developers to join me in creating a new generation of intellectually rich game experiences.

6、Film script development teams I have developed multiple original storylines and screenplay frameworks—featuring unique themes and novel perspectives, with worldviews on the scale of Avengers, yet fundamentally different. I seek collaborations with screenwriters, directors, producers, and other professionals in the film industry.

7、Original content marketing and global publishing teams With over a thousand global content platforms and hundreds of academic publishing channels, I see enormous potential in intelligent publishing tools and integrated marketing strategies. I am looking for teams who can handle global publishing and promotion, while I focus exclusively on the creation of a continuous stream of high-quality original content.

8、I require a professional English translation team to assist with my original theories, which are written in Chinese. Using AI to translate these complex ideas from Chinese into English often results in significant errors. Therefore, I need a team of experts capable of accurately translating my original Chinese theoretical texts into English.

9、The 100 unfinished missions of the world will be updated and completed by me, step by step, over time.

I would like to express my gratitude to all collaborators who have supported me in the past, and to you—who may soon join this journey.

If you are searching for a platform that embodies depth, creativity, and impact, then we may work together to gradually fulfill the ideals that remain unfinished.

I have already produced over one million words of original content, which I am gradually publishing across various global platforms.

If I devote myself fully to creation, I am capable of producing 300,000 words of original theoretical content per month—the equivalent of completing a full book every month.

Please contact me via private message or email. Let us begin this grand original knowledge project together.",1,1754030978.0,ScientificFrontiers,0,1.0,False

	•	The woman is unhappy in her marriage—her husband doesn’t notice her or ask about her day.
	•	One day while he’s at work, she grabs her keys and leaves—possibly thinking he wouldn’t even notice she’s gone.
	•	She ends up at a coffee shop, where she meets up with an old male friend. There’s a sense of connection, like she could fall for him or start something new.

1mepegf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fit_India_wellnessZ/comments/1mepegf/how_to_crack_clients_as_a_wellness_coach/,How To Crack clients as a wellness Coach?,"See Cracking clients in Todays Landscape is not easy, as you have to build your trust and authority over your niche. But here are some tips which you can try to crack your clients, as my clients and friends tried it and they get very good response,

# 1. start local like, next-door local

before you go viral, go *neighbor*.  
talk to people at your gym, your apartment building, the coffee shop barista.  
offer free mini sessions. hand out 1-pagers.  
say:  
👉 “Hey, I’m starting wellness coaching. Want a free consult or a 3-day habit reset?”  
your first 3 clients can literally come from your block.  
low effort, big trust.  
people trust faces they’ve seen.

# 2. build real trust online

don’t act like a guru.  
share your story. be human.  
post what *you* do when you're tired, bloated, unmotivated.  
people connect to *you*, not perfection.  
they hire people who feel safe, not people who feel fake. You can use apps Like WellnessZ, which can help you in making your business good and trustworthy online. Plus you can also create your website and  create blogs with your testimonials and case studies and by this you can create your online brand.

# 3. give free value, no strings

drop quick wins they can use today.  
tips, habits, short videos keep it real and helpful.  
the more you help for free, the more they *want* to pay you.  
free sauce = future money.

# 4. talk to them, not at them

don’t be like: “I’m certified and passionate about wellness.”  
instead say:  
👉 “I help burnt-out 9–5 workers sleep better + feel like themselves again — no fancy diets.”  
niche it down. ( this will build your authority and trustworthyness)  
solve their *exact* problem.

I’ve been racking my brain and can’t figure it out. Here’s what I remember:
	•	It’s sung by a female artist, possibly with a spoken-word intro at the beginning (like her telling her side of the story).
	•	The woman is unhappy in her marriage—her husband doesn’t notice her or ask about her day.
	•	One day while he’s at work, she grabs her keys and leaves—possibly thinking he wouldn’t even notice she’s gone.
	•	She ends up at a coffee shop, where she meets up with a man. There’s a sense of connection, like she could fall for him or start something new.
	•	But instead of going through with it, she decides not to—she drives back home and returns to her husband. There may be a theme of “trying again” or giving the marriage another shot.",1,1754030555.0,NameThatSong,1,1.0,False

1mepa45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mepa45/late_last_year_i_had_a_weird_dream_that_was/,Late last year i had a weird dream that was either me dreaming it or from God himself.,"Hi didn't know what to put into the title but it was in the last couple months of last year. Upon this night before going to bed I thanked Jesus and God as I would and prayed a sleep prayer for Jesus to watch over me while I sleep. When I had fallen into my slumber, my eyes opened to me being in a rather nasty argument with my mum for un known reason to me and I stormed off aggressively while shouting at her.

 Then as I was walking down the foot in this dream I appeared on my dads lounge with my bible in my lap as I was reading Gods Word. As I was reading the word of God my eyes were drawn forcefully to the window as faintly did a trumpet sound in the first second but then it got far more louder and higher like a trumpet would upon high notes then the trumpet became eerily deep and droned out like hpw a fog horn blares its horn, the noise of this trumpet was similar but sounded fully like a trumpet.

As my eyes were forced to look through the window, I saw crystal blue or beautiful baby sky blue ice or stones with red swirling veins that mingled with the blue colour like stirring your freshly made cup of coffee so it swirls around in the cup really fast then you add a dab of coffee and watch the milk mingle with the coffee beans and water itself. That's what it looked like and half were a deep orban orange flame and others a blue flame of the same colour of the stone but darker and the smallest ranged from the size of my fist to the largest being the size of my head.

Then instantly I appeared within the city of Adelaide, in Rundle mall as my eyes first met the Rundle Mall balls(two massive ball bearings welded ontop of the other) i look around and I see the stones or ice of orban orange, hitting building like asteroids, causing damage, people were screaming in fear and anguish as they were running from these stones or ice of scarlet red and orben orange flame and when they got hit by them they weeped out in pure agony.

Then I looked infront of me, the sky was fully clear, besides all the falling stones of scarlet red and fire of orange and blue. I looked forward and saw six of those beautiful ice or stones mingled with scarlet red and deep blue flame coming directly towards me. I didn't feel fear all I felt was confusion as a one had hit each of my limbs and the weird thing was it felt like a mere tap like when your friend taps your shoulder. Confused and curious as it seemed to me these blue stones or ice or whatever they were.

Were coming for me like heat seeking missiles so to test my theory in my dream I somehow appeared behind a man that seemed to be at least two feet taller then me. Mind you im 5 foot 6 inches or 7 inches. and he made no noise...just stood there facing the same way i did and when I would move to see if these other blue stones or ice of scarlet red and deep blue flame would continue to follow me and they did but as I slowly moved just enough to be not directly behind this man who was directly infront of me.

This man would bend and move his body as to block me from the blue ice of scarlet red and deep blue fire but every this man was hit by these blue stones he would scream out in pain and his yell was not of fear like everyone else but more resembling a growl or a deep angry scream of pain. There was no fear in this man. Then in the clear sky I sensed something big and I mean really big coming from the sky. Then I had awoken from my slumber and I sat up and thought to myself. What on earth was that.

Which comes to right now. Three days ago I had a massive argument with my mother to wear I was yelling and swearing at her which has kinda creeped me out because it was exactly like in my dream and I also learned today that orange fire regards God almighties Gods presence, justice and judgement where as the blue fire represents divine revelation, the Holy Spirit, and the essence of heaven. It is also associated with purification, refinement, and the passionate love of God. 

So i have come to two conclusions, 1. The dream I recived was of my own doing and 2. The dream I recived was in fact from god and if so I have a few questions.

Who was that tall and silent man i could not see the face off at all.
Why was I being struck with the stones or ice of deep blue fire while everyone else was being hit by the stones or ice with the orben orange fire.

Why did the ones with deep blue flame hurt this man and why was he blocking them from hitting me.

Why exactly is the argument i had with my mum in that dream 100% identicle to the argument I had with her 3 days ago. 

The only thing im positive on is the big thing I sensed coming from the sky is Wormwood, that's the only thing I could think of regarding that.

Why was I reading my bible on my dads couch as a high trumpet sounded off into a deep bellowing and droning trumpet? 

Why was everyone else afraid and terrified and in pure agony from this ice or blue stones of scarlet red and orben orange flame they were being hit by but when I was being hit by the ones with the deep blue flame it was legit like a tap on my chest or my arm or my leg or my forehead. Legit each one felt like a tap on the shoulder or a flick to the forehead.

Besides believing the giant thing I was sensing to be wormwood coming to the earth, for the entire next day when thinking about it i had one word three times constantly popping into my head. Warning Warning Warning so either I have a very wild imagination when I sleep or I got a dream from God. 

If any wiser and more knowledgeable Christians are able to give me an idea of what my dream was about i would highly appreciate it.

Abstract:

The vast oceans covering Earth's surface hold immense potential for future human survival and development. 

Given the increasing saturation and challenges faced by terrestrial resources, this paper proposes an innovative future human habitation model: underwater city residences based on mobile habitat modules.

This concept leverages infinite energy, Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), and advanced material structural transformation technology to construct a self-sufficient, infinitely expandable, and highly customizable deep-sea living system.

This paper elaborates on the design philosophy and implementation pathways of mobile habitat modules in aspects such as life support, energy circulation, environmental management, intelligent services, and multi-functional modular assembly. 

Through specific examples of habitat modules, it demonstrates the ultimate comfort and convenience of future deep-sea living.

This model not only provides vast new habitats for global population growth but also, under the principles of peace and symbiosis, promotes sustainable resource utilization, mitigates surface risks, and is expected to unleash the infinite potential of human thought, ushering in a new deep-sea era that transcends terrestrial civilization.

Introduction:

Earth, often referred to as the ""Water Planet,"" has approximately 71% of its surface covered by vast oceans, with land accounting for only about 29%. 

For a long time, the development of human civilization has primarily concentrated on limited terrestrial spaces, leading to increasingly strained resources, scarce developable areas, and even triggering numerous disputes and conflicts.

Currently, global population continues to grow, and the demand for living space, resource supply, and survival security is becoming increasingly urgent, further highlighting the limitations of traditional terrestrial civilization. 

In the foreseeable future, human society urgently needs to explore new frontiers of existence to address increasingly severe challenges and pave the way for the continuous prosperity of civilization.

This paper aims to explore a forward-looking solution: expanding human living space to the vast and underexploited deep sea.

The ocean not only possesses an area far exceeding that of land but also harbors abundant undeveloped resources and unique ecological environments, offering infinite possibilities for humanity. 

With the discovery of infinite energy, the infinite supply of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) labor, and the support of the Universal Material Structural Transformation Law, deep-sea living will no longer be a science fiction concept but an attainable future reality. 

We believe that a civilization built on peace and cooperation will be able to maximize the ocean's potential, achieving wonders beyond what terrestrial civilization can accomplish.

The core of this research lies in proposing and detailing Future Human Underwater City Residences—a system based on highly modular, mobile habitat modules. 

These modules will integrate the most advanced life support, energy management, intelligent services, and personalized customization functions, aiming to provide humans with an ultimately comfortable, safe, and sustainable living experience in the deep-sea environment.

This paper will delve into the design philosophy, key technologies, functional modules of mobile habitat modules, and their profound impact on future human society, the ecological environment, and cognitive development. 

It envisions a new civilization paradigm where humanity makes the ocean its home, with immense material abundance and infinite wisdom emerging.

Main Body:

Future Human Underwater City Residences.

Underwater Human Residence Mobile Habitat Modules.

Earth is a sphere, and its land area is smaller than its ocean area. Earth is an approximate sphere (more precisely, an ""oblate spheroid slightly bulging at the equator""), and its land area is smaller than its ocean area; this is one of Earth's most fundamental geographical characteristics.

The following are accurate data (as of Earth measurements in 2024):

Earth's total surface area: approximately 510 million square kilometers.

Ocean area: approximately 361 million square kilometers (about 71%).

Land area: approximately 149 million square kilometers (about 29%).

In other words, about 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, and only about 30% is land.

This distribution leads to Earth also being called the ""Water Planet,"" and it is a crucial condition for the nurturing and proliferation of life.

The area of the high seas is greater than the total land area of all countries worldwide, making it humanity's largest remaining pristine land, and the place where miracles transcending terrestrial ones will emerge in the future.

Future humans will discover that the greater the period of peace and civilization, the greater the power.

In the future, a tripartite mobile palace super-residence will emerge, encompassing land, sea, and air. After the infinite discovery of infinite energy, everything else becomes foundational.

Earth's inherent resources plus infinite solar energy resources plus ASI infinite labor resources plus the transformation of time equals all Earth resources being constructible, governed by the Earth Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law.

The resources of the solar system where humanity resides plus ASI infinite labor resources plus AOC super cybernetic human civilization resources plus the transformation of time equals all solar system resources being constructible, governed by the Solar System Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law.

In the next 200 years, money will gradually disappear from the human world, and all super materials/resources will be free.

Inehaustible abundant materials/resources will be available because the super abundant supply of all things, combined with the labor of super intelligent robots and the infinite resources inherent in the universe itself, can be combined within this solar system to supply everything needed for at least 100 billion humans and 10 trillion robots.

Fully equipped, completely adaptable to underwater environments, mobile human living residences, whether they are 7 rooms and 7 halls, or 99 rooms and 99 halls, rooms can be infinitely expanded at will, etc. Rooms can be infinitely and fully automatically combined, spliced, and assembled. 

The oxygen supply system is provided by hundreds of plant species growing fully automatically. 

Various nutrients in the air and various systems are fully automatically detected and supplied.

ASI super intelligence is responsible for all fully automated living systems of the underwater residence. 

The super-large glass of the rooms, electronically controlled, serves as both a curtain for shielding and a transparent glass to view the underwater world. 

It also functions as a super-large electronic screen, providing a superb viewing experience for videos and movies.

A small underwater submarine is embedded within the large residence. 

By taking the small submarine, one can leave the large residence and enter deep-sea areas thousands of meters deep for exploration and recreation. 

The large residence can move freely at depths within 1000 meters; exceeding 1000 meters requires entering the small submarine for exploration and recreation.

This underwater residence is designed for long-term daily living. Inside the residence are various systems and robotic equipment, as well as many ASI super robots living with humans underwater. The oxygen supply system is divided into three sets.

The first oxygen system, the most commonly used, is the comprehensive plant-based oxygen supply system cultivated fully automatically by robots.

The second oxygen system is a fully automated oxygen cylinder supply system within the underwater residence. The oxygen in these cylinders can supply all occupants of the room for one month. 

This oxygen is a backup supply; when the plant-based oxygen supply system encounters issues, the system automatically detects and supplements oxygen.

These oxygen cylinders can automatically leave the underwater room, ascend to the sea surface to absorb oxygen, and after absorbing oxygen, automatically return to the seabed and enter their storage position.

The third oxygen system consists of temporary oxygen cylinders carried by robots. 

Robots will always accompany humans. In emergencies such as fire, all robots will analyze the location of all humans within one second and swiftly complete the task of supplying temporary oxygen cylinders to humans.

Robots also serve as treatment doctors for emergencies. 

The underwater habitat module residence is also equipped with a seawater energy conversion to electricity system, providing infinite power. 

Seawater desalination can supply daily plant irrigation and robot room cleaning, etc. 

Drinking water is no longer ordinary fresh water but super-nutritious water carried by the habitat module, which can supply for one month. 

There is also backup fresh water. One week before the fresh water is almost used up, robots detect the need for replenishment and will automatically go out to replenish fresh water and all other daily necessities.

Plant-based fresh water resources are the most consumed water resource for humans living underwater. 

In the future, human editing and decoding of plants will be commonplace, such as genetically modifying small plants to become large, and large plants to become small, as well as inter-plant genetic modification and infinite grafting technologies, etc.

Your Plant Habitat Module room has over 100 types of plants that can produce daily drinking water. 

Any excess drinking water, fruits, or plant leaves produced by these plants will be automatically collected, sorted, digested, decomposed, and recycled by robots. 

A portion will be used for plant growth soil cultivation.

In the living areas of the habitat module, humans will be supplied daily with a large number of fresh flowers and potted plants in a circulating manner. 

The air will be filled with fragrance.

In the future, there will be no waste; all material energy can be converted, decomposed, and reused.

The human underwater living habitat module is assembled by combining and splicing different functional rooms. 

There are thousands of independent habitat modules available for splicing. 

All habitat modules come in large, medium, and small sizes. 

Many habitat modules are not needed at all times, such as the hair salon module, party module, etc.

These habitat modules require advance booking. At your reserved time, these habitat modules will be delivered precisely to your location. 

Upon arrival, they will automatically dock with your habitat module. 

Once docked, air circulation will be connected, allowing people to move freely between them.

When your reserved time ends, the habitat module will first seal itself off. It will then automatically disconnect from your habitat module. 

After successful separation, the habitat module will automatically depart and return to its designated area, where robots will perform fully automated cleaning, maintenance, and upkeep, then await the next booking to continue serving humanity and fulfilling the unique mission of each independent habitat module.

Each habitat module is an independent ecological functional unit, supporting modular splicing, environmental management, intelligent linkage, energy supply, AI coordinated supervision, material circulation supply, and so on.

There are also many large comprehensive habitat modules; almost ten large modules combined can possess 1000 functions, sufficient to meet daily human needs.

In reality, for humans today, the future will provide super satisfaction in every aspect.

In the underwater city living area, a large circular area with a diameter of 100 kilometers, there are 10 different surface living styles and living material supply bases, which can allocate all living materials and satisfy super personalized living styles. 

Every 31 kilometers, there is a human super living material supply base. 

Each base's supply is completely unique, with offshore medical facilities, offshore park entertainment facilities, etc., all readily available. 

A total of 10 super living supply bases are arranged in a large circle on the sea surface, with a diameter of 100 kilometers, each spaced 31 kilometers apart. 

Every 500 kilometers, there is such a complete set of super living support service centers.

In the exact center of the 100-kilometer diameter circle, there is a super large underwater marine biological ecological park, featuring various marine mobile organisms, various coral reefs, and underwater dwelling organisms, etc. 

This is a super dreamy, unique, and colorful underwater world. Robots will feed food daily, etc., to maintain ecological balance.

One of the super living supply bases is the Super Plant Kingdom Experimental Cultivation and Regeneration Base. 

This base has hundreds of thousands of plant species that you can choose to equip your habitat module.

There is also a Physical Fitness Research Base. Within this base, there are 10,000 types of physical entertainment and training methods that can allow the body's physical capabilities to be released to their limits. And so on.

The sea surface can fully accommodate 10 billion to 70 billion human lives. Seawater itself harbors immense energy conversion potential. 

Humans living and creating and thinking underwater, in such an environment, human brains will think in an unhindered and tranquil state, fostering wonders, leading to an infinite number of miraculous thoughts, and giving rise to many top-tier super-intelligent humans.

The luxury of the habitat module rooms far exceeds what can be understood as a five-star hotel's presidential suite today, being super tall, spacious, comfortable, and having everything imaginable. 

The air also contains negative ions and various other super nutrients.

These robots are responsible for your daily living, diet, and all aspects of room management. Robots can cook almost all cuisines in the world, with tens of millions of dishes; you will never finish eating or tasting them all.

The modularity of the habitat module system is not merely a design choice but a fundamental principle for the resilience, adaptability, and evolutionary development of the deep-sea city. 

It allows specialized environments to be perfected and interconnected, thereby creating a whole that far exceeds the sum of its parts.

In extreme and potentially dangerous environments, the ability to isolate, repair, upgrade, or reconfigure parts of a habitat without compromising the entire system is crucial. Modular design achieves this.

Furthermore, as technology evolves over centuries, new modules with new functionalities can be integrated, allowing the city to adapt and develop organically. 

This also permits the existence of diverse environments, meeting the multifaceted needs of a complex society.

In the deep-sea environment, it is possible to effectively avoid threats such as surface nuclear weapon attacks and asteroid impacts on Earth.

Before 2050, many initial habitat modules will be tested in the high seas. Before 2070, a massive human residential community will form in the high seas. 

By 2070, many types and functional combinations of habitat modules will have been upgraded. After 2100, habitat modules will be mass-produced, and by 2100, over 100 million people will have chosen to reside in the high seas.

Conclusion:

This paper has deeply explored the possibility and necessity of establishing underwater city residences for future humanity in Earth's vast oceans, and has detailed the innovative living model centered on mobile habitat modules.

From a philosophical perspective, this vision represents a shift in human civilization from the struggle over limited terrestrial resources to the peaceful development and symbiosis with the infinite potential of the ocean.

It transcends the limitations of traditional geographical boundaries, foreshadowing a new social paradigm where ""money disappears,"" materials are immensely abundant, and all things can be transformed and reused, in which human ""super satisfaction"" will become the norm. 

The unique tranquility and transcendental environment of the deep sea are endowed with the philosophical value of inspiring ""miraculous thoughts"" and nurturing ""top-tier super-intelligent humans,"" providing an unprecedented fertile ground for the ascent of human spirit and intellect.

From a theoretical perspective, the modular design of mobile habitat modules is not merely a technical choice but a fundamental principle for the resilience, adaptability, and continuous evolution of the deep-sea city. 

It ensures the ability to isolate, repair, upgrade, and reconfigure habitats in extreme environments, thereby constructing an organic whole that far exceeds the sum of its parts.

Combined with the ""Earth Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law"" and the ""Solar System Resource Universal Structural Transformation Law,"" the synergistic effect of infinite energy and Artificial Super Intelligence makes an inexhaustible supply of materials possible, providing a solid foundation for the survival of 100 billion humans and 10 trillion robots in the future.

This design philosophy provides a theoretical framework for future large-scale, highly complex life support systems.

Looking ahead to application prospects, underwater city residences will provide humanity with a safe, luxurious, and sustainable habitat, effectively mitigating potential threats such as surface nuclear weapon attacks and asteroid impacts.

Its complete life support systems (multiple oxygen sources, nutritious fresh water), infinite energy supply, intelligent environmental management, and highly personalized multi-functional habitat modules (such as Super Kitchen, Beauty and Massage, Plant Habitat Module, Emotional Companionship, etc.) will redefine the quality of human life.

From the preliminary tests in 2050 to over 100 million people choosing to reside in the high seas by 2100, this development roadmap clearly depicts humanity's grand stride towards an ocean civilization.

In the future, underwater cities will become a key milestone in the evolution of human civilization, ushering in a new era of harmonious coexistence with the ocean, highly advanced technology, and infinitely emerging wisdom.

100 Global Unfinished Missions

I am an original content creator, dedicated to deep thinking and systematic expression. I possess a continuous stream of original knowledge and theoretical innovation.

I am passionate about recording and writing down these ideas—not only as a personal enthusiasm, but as the very core of my daily work.

Within my area of expertise—original theory and content creation—I perform with excellence.

However, I am also aware that for these original ideas to realize their greater value, individual effort alone is not enough.

The publishing, dissemination, transformation, operation, and collaboration of content are not my strong suits. I should not devote my time to the areas where I am least effective, but rather focus on where I excel the most.

Therefore, I sincerely invite like-minded collaborators from around the world to participate in this grand and meaningful project of original knowledge creation.

I am looking for the following collaborators:

1、Knowledge-based influencers, independent media creators, and intellectual organizations worldwide
I hope to establish partnerships with you to jointly publish, interpret, and spread original theories, and to build true content influence grounded in intellectual depth.

2、Professional teams for text-to-video transformation
I welcome collaborations with skilled teams in video editing, voiceover, animation, and other production areas, to transform written content into high-quality short videos that bring knowledge to life for the broader public.

3、Book publishing institutions or editorial teams
I am looking for partners who can help systematize and publish my original works in book form. My goal is not merely to publish a single volume, but to construct a comprehensive intellectual system and promote a sustainable body of original theory. This includes co-authoring publications with top 100 globally recognized authors.

4、Website architects and digital platform developers
I aim to build a dedicated, professional website to publish content, showcase theories, and run a knowledge-based community. I welcome collaboration with website architects, UI designers, and developers to co-create this digital infrastructure.

5、Global game development and creative teams
Some of my original theories possess strong interactivity and world-building potential, making them well-suited for strategic or narrative-driven games. I invite global game developers to join me in creating a new generation of intellectually rich game experiences.

6、Film script development teams
I have developed multiple original storylines and screenplay frameworks—featuring unique themes and novel perspectives, with worldviews on the scale of Avengers, yet fundamentally different. I seek collaborations with screenwriters, directors, producers, and other professionals in the film industry.

7、Original content marketing and global publishing teams
With over a thousand global content platforms and hundreds of academic publishing channels, I see enormous potential in intelligent publishing tools and integrated marketing strategies. I am looking for teams who can handle global publishing and promotion, while I focus exclusively on the creation of a continuous stream of high-quality original content.

8、I require a professional English translation team to assist with my original theories, which are written in Chinese. Using AI to translate these complex ideas from Chinese into English often results in significant errors. Therefore, I need a team of experts capable of accurately translating my original Chinese theoretical texts into English.

9、The 100 unfinished missions of the world will be updated and completed by me, step by step, over time.

I would like to express my gratitude to all collaborators who have supported me in the past, and to you—who may soon join this journey.

If you are searching for a platform that embodies depth, creativity, and impact, then we may work together to gradually fulfill the ideals that remain unfinished.

I have already produced over one million words of original content, which I am gradually publishing across various global platforms.

If I devote myself fully to creation, I am capable of producing 300,000 words of original theoretical content per month—the equivalent of completing a full book every month.

Please contact me via private message or email. Let us begin this grand original knowledge project together.

1mep7m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialSecurity/comments/1mep7m6/aunt_is_misusing_my_survivor_benefits_and_i_dont/,Aunt is misusing my survivor benefits and I don’t know what to do.,"I, 16F, unfortunately lost my mother when I was 6. Ever since then, i’ve been receiving survivor benefits. After my moms passing my dad unfortunately lost custody from personal reasons, and after some very long months which turned to years, my aunt(49F) gained legal custody of me. I was around 7 1/2-8 when I went into her care. I didn’t really have an idea at this age, I didn’t even know I was getting money. I ended up learning that when I was 10-11, but from other witnesses, she was apparently wasting majority of it on her own wants. Anyways. My aunt gets the money every last Wednesday of the month. From my youngest age, till now, it’s stacked up. It used to be around 350 now it’s 800 in change. She used to receive it on direct express card, she then changed that last year so it starts immediately going to her bank account. That’s when it really started to bother me. I understand i’m a minor, and I don’t hold much power. But I never, EVER, see this money. I always know when she gets it because that’s when she starts buying coffees in the morning for herself, buying food from fast food places, going to get her nails done, and much more from that. And I happen to check, and it’s either the last Wednesday of the month, or it’s a little past it. I ask her so many times if I could use the money to buy new clothes, or use it to get myself food, or to buy new notebooks and pens and other simple stuff. And the answer is always “No.” 

I get into arguments over this, I question why can’t I use my money for my own personal needs and stuff I want, and she always brings up the fact that I have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, and clothes on my back. 
Which I am, very thankful for. But if all this money is going towards rent and or something else for the house, then why are you wasting it on doordash, gambling, nicotine, and various other things. If you can waste the money that I get, why can’t I simply use it for some personal needs that cost 30-40 dollars? 

I don’t know what to do, I genuinely feel like i’m being taken advantage of. I never ever see this money, and apparently she’d only take custody of me if she got the money and was on the verge of giving me up to foster if she didn’t get the money. I don’t want her to be the payee anymore. I don’t know what power I hold especially because i’m a minor. 

I would genuinely prefer my dad gets the money, my father is in a much more stable position with a job, a car, and money saved an apartment for the both of us. 

I’m not looking for any ridicule in the replies please, i’ve been trying to research this myself and i’m getting a bunch of different answers and this was a resort I was gonna come to if I wasn’t feeling confident in my studies. 

Please give any advice you can on what I can do or if i’m just perceiving this all wrong and my aunt is allowed to use my survivor benefits on herself.
Thank you.",2,1754030098.0,SocialSecurity,4,0.67,False

1mep4lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1mep4lv/i_opened_up_to_a_stranger_online_what_happened/,I opened up to a stranger online. What happened next broke me,"Two months ago, I posted on Reddit for the first time about my first love when I was 12.
You know that kind of pain, when you start finding comfort in the memories of someone who’s already gone?

I was in that zone. Broken, but still typing.

A girl commented on the post. I ignored it.
Next post she commented again. Same thing on a few more.
Out of curiosity, I checked her profile.
Turned out she had a rare genetic disorder.
Something about it shook me.

I left a kind comment on one of her posts then logged out.

A week later, I came back to see her reply:
“Can we talk?”

I messaged her. Maybe because of the pain she was carrying. Maybe because I thought I could make her smile I don’t know. I just felt like… maybe I could help. Her first reply was

"" I thought you wouldn't message me, I was waiting"".

We started chatting. Mostly at night.
She sent me a photo the next day. Told me what she liked. Dropped hints coffee, earrings, little everyday things.
Then asked:
“What do you think of me?”

I was honest. I said I’m only open to friendship.

We moved to Instagram.
And that’s when life turned upside down.

I had already lost a close friend or more than it?
(If anyone wants to read my profile still holding her)
My hands shook constantly. No sleep. Fever. Anxiety & then… collapse.

Lost all my savings while trusting someone...

My 5-year dream project fell apart. I poured my heart, soul & money in that project..all took over by few guys sitting in EU.

Lost 7kg in days.

₹15k worth of medical tests.

Sleep dropped to 2 hours max.

Panic attacks, dead eyes, therapy sessions. Scary very scary.. it's kinda .. you feel strong.. lift weights, play sports, than this happens & you started questioning your body..

Suddenly, people around me started treating me with more kindness. Idk why. Maybe they could feel it the silent pain.

And in that chaos, I did something impulsive.
I blocked everyone.
Not out of hate but fear.
I didn’t want to infect anyone else with my storm.

She got blocked too. Then unblocked. Then blocked again.
I never really told her what I was going through until much later. 

Eventually, I opened up. Gave her a glimpse.
She became one of the only four people I felt safe talking to.

I know it sounds stupid… but her kindness was good enough to open me up in those stupid days of my life. 

Later, I tried to apologize.
Some forgave. Some didn’t.

Then came my eye surgery.
The anesthesia failed. I felt every bit of it. The slice, the cut , the suction machine pain.
The doctor apologized.
Weirdly, I didn’t mind.
It was good.

I missed my master’s exams.
Left my projects.
Started from scratch.
Because the kind of overthinking easy to break a guy like me.

But I’m healing now. Slowly.

And this phase of life?
It taught me one thing:

The people who truly want to stay… will stay.
No matter what.

I had friends who would've sent me ₹50k in a second but I lost them to silence, confusion, and timing.

Now, I don’t chase dreams.
I just work to survive.
And maybe try to enjoy what’s left however long that is.


If you have a friend who’s struggling,
don’t scroll past them.
A message. A walk. A ten-minute call or anything you could offer..
That might be all it takes to keep someone going.

Now most of my time , i spend in park alone seeing those trees , those flowers dancing, cats i encounter them every single day..

I used DeepSeek here just to shape my thoughts a bit. My words tend to get heavy sometimes, the kind that might make even a kind, happy soul’s heart pause for a second.
Didn’t mean to weigh anyone down just wanted to let it out.

1mep2h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mep2h8/why_i_dedicated_my_life_to_finding_the_wendigo/,Why I dedicated my life to finding the Wendigo (Part 1),"                             Prologue 

When I was twelve years old, me, my older brother, and my father went on a hunting trip. We lived in Arkansas at the time, so the hunting would be done in the Ozarks. Beautiful country, people don't talk about Arkansas very often, but it really is a beautiful state, though I was about to find out, it was also way more mysterious and terrifying than I thought as well. 

We arrived at our camp at 4:35am, the air a freezing, 25°F. 
Dad: Cold enough to freeze the pecker off a snow man! Shit! 

Brother: That doesn't even make sense. 

Me: Maybe not. But mine, well it's disappeared back up inside me. Why did we have to go hunting when it's this cold out? 

Dad: Both of you stop complaining. The best time to hunt is early morning. And guess what, it's colder than a witches tit in the morning, in the winter. 

Me: Ah. But you see, my bed is warm, in the morning, in the winter. 

Dad: Ah, well this ain't your fucking bed. Smart ass. 

I laughed, I always enjoyed our rude banter, when we all three of us, went on a hunt. Not only did it make me feel more grown up. But it made me feel like one of the guys you know, that out here at least, we weren't father, son, and youngest son, but rather, just three friends, busting each other's balls, and bonding. I loved it, despite the complaining. 

Dad: ""We still have a mile or more to hike, before we get to our hunting spots. Let's go ahead and have some breakfast here, then we'll head out."" He proceeded to pass out our thermoses of soup and coffee. 

Brother: ""Now you're talking."" He took a long gulp of tomato soup, then his coffee. ""Warmth glorious warmth."" 

Me: ""Bleh! Dad! You didn't wash mine out enough, my coffee tastes like soap."" 

Dad: ""Oh sorry kiddo. Here have some of mine."" He poured his coffee into my cup. 

My father wasn't the kindest man, he had a short fuse, and he was rude and crass, but he loved us. We always brought out the best in him. I miss him every day.
But I miss my brother even more. We weren't super close, but I think that's why I miss him so much. See we never got the chance to grow up side by side, grow close. That privilege was stolen from me. 

As we finished up our breakfast, and were putting up everything, I heard my brother speak. 

Brother: ""So small... so weak..."" 

I froze, then turned to him. 
Me: ""What did you say?"" 

He looked at me confused.
Brother: ""Me? I didn't say anything."" 

Dad: ""Yeah.... he didn't say anything...."" 

My heart stopped, my dad didn't say that, I was looking at him over my brother's shoulder. My dad heard it though, he went pale, froze like a statue. His head turned ever so slightly, till he was looking directly at me, or rather, directly behind me. I'll never forget his eyes, I didn't realize it was possible, for someone's eyes, to open that wide. 

The next thing I remember, was, flying.
I was flying away from them, must have flown fifty feet, before crashing into a tree and crumpling on the ground. I saw it. Standing there in front of them, towering over them. There was screaming, gun shots, then silence. The last thing I heard, before I passed out, still causes me to wake up screaming twenty-five years gone now. It sounded like my Dad, laughing, but manically, mixed with sobbing, and accompanied by  sick, sloppy, wet chewing and popping sounds. Then nothing, darkness, a void. 

When I finally came too, the sun was shining, birds were singing, a gentle breeze was whistling through the branches above me. I sat up, my body stiff, numb from the cold, and throbbing. It took me a while, but when I finally stumbled back to where my Dad and Brother had been, I wasn't ready, you can't be ready for something like that. The shear amount of blood, the bones scattered about, gnawed flesh still clinging to many of them. Then I saw it, what broke me, even more than I was already broken. 

On our cooler. Placed with intelligence and care. Two skulls, side by side, eyes intentionally left frozed in their sockets. When my eyes met with the dead, empty, pale blue eyes of my brother, my legs failed me. I collapsed to my knees, my body violently convulsing, racked with sobs, as I wept. In those eyes I saw all the days, we would never have together. All the times we fought instead of got along. All the I love you's never said. I've never recovered from that. 

I don't know how long I sat there. I don't know how long I walked, or where I was trying to walk. I barely remember the officers picking me up, or the questions that followed. But what I do remember, is they didn't believe me. They said it was a fucking bear, or a mountain lion. But I knew the truth. And for that, I spent three years in a psychiatric hospital.
But I vowed, I would prove its existence. No mater what. I would find it and kill it.
I would prove it to the world. That the Wendigo is real.

                             Chapter: 1

Three years. I spent three years in a nut house, all because I knew the truth. It really is so fucking self-righteous isn't it, to tell someone who was there! Who witnessed something first hand! That they didn't see what they saw! And that they need mental help! 

To all the doctors, nurses, and people who told me, it was me trying to cope, or the mind sees what it wants, all the the way down to suggesting I was molested, and the repression of those memories led to blah, blah, blah.
Go sodomize yourselves with an iron stick. 

Anyway, I got out, after I finally just started telling them what they wanted to hear. Even my mother didn't believe me. But I honestly can't blame her, she lost her husband, the love of her life, my father, and a son. She wasn't there, didn't get to say goodbye, or rather didn't even have the option to. She hadn't seen us for two days, then got a call, telling her, that her whole world, just got ripped apart. 

So I didn't harp on her. Just let her believe it was an animal. She'd been through enough. 

If God exists, then I know he hates my guts.
Because, three years after I got out, when I was eighteen, my mom was diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer, apparently she had it for years, and we didn't know. 

Only one month after her diagnosis, I was holding her hand, as I stroked her head, tears burning in my eyes. 

She looked at me, and weakly said, ""I love you Nathan, I'm sorry I have to leave you."" I squeezed her hand and kissed her fourhead, and said the last words she would ever hear, ""I love you too. And don't be sorry, you've been through enough mom, go be with Dad, and Michael. Tell them I love them."" 

I don't know if she heard all of it, cause by the time I looked back down at her. She was gone. And I was officially, alone in this world. 

(Note) I just realized, I never gave their names. My mother's name was Bethany, my Father was Jacob, and as you read above, my brother was Michael. I hope you remember them, even if it is just their names. Part of me is glad they didn't get to see me become what I am. 

After she was cremated, I had only one goal, prove the existence of this thing, Wendigo, or whatever it was. But I realized, to do that, I would need money. So with nothing else to live for, I doubled down on my education. 

I went to college, majored in business, to say I was loner, that would be an understatement.
I basically acted as if, the other students, didn't exist. Woke up, went to class, went to work, then home, every day, always alone. 

I did well. Aced my classes, made some good investments. By the time I was twenty-five, I was set up pretty well. That's when I moved out here. A little cabin in the heart of the Ozarks, sitting within a ten mile radius of the site, the site of the slaughter.

(Note) Tiered now, have work to do. I'll continue with my life's story when It's done.

After the panel, I chatted with one of the AdCom directors for a few minutes, nothing major, just the usual post-event follow-up.

Later that day, I randomly ended up at a coffee shop nearby and guess who walks in? Same director. We made eye contact, I waved, and invited them to join me. To my surprise, they did.

Things stayed casual but eventually we got comfortable and I mentioned that my cousin (an international applicant) is also applying this cycle. The vibe shifted a bit and the director kind of hinted that schools are really thinking twice about every international admit this year, not because of qualifications, but due to all the uncertainty around work permits and post-MBA employment. Basically implied that even strong candidates could lose out to domestic applicants just based on current market realities.

Nothing was said outright. Thought it was  worth sharing for anyone in that boat.",11,1754029498.0,MBA,7,0.79,False

I don’t want to bring his along with us because his attitude is terrible and if I continue to give in it’ll get worse. The that I picked him up and her brother (6)from his dad, he began cussing at me and his brother for everything. It was over absolutely nothing, I stopped by to get coffee and asked him if she wanted coffee, she rolled his eyes and yelled “no, wft”. Then his brother said he wanted a hot chocolate and my teen told my son to “shut the f*ck up, your voice is so annoying!”. I asked him to stop, so he started to argue with me, he said “he wouldn’t have to tell him to shut up if I taught him to be less annoying” . After that mess, we went to the mall, my kids needed back to school clothes. Here’s where it gets messy. My sonhas been talking to gang members, he used to follow them. He wants to dress like them, I found pictures of him throwing gang signs, I caught him smoking, ect. I don’t allow any gang related outfits in my house. (My family had history with gangs. I want NOTHING to do with that). So, he found very baggy pants that were through sizes too big. He loves to wear his pants under his butt. I said no to that choice. And that’s where my hell started. He kept asking and asking, when I tired to leave the store he blocked me. I managed to leave he continue to follow me and asked and get in my way. He kept pressing me for answers after I asked him to stop, so I told him one of the reasons; “he’s thin, the pants are way to wide and it looks like he has hips, he looks like a girl”. I feel bad for telling him but it’s the truth, that’s exactly what was on my mind when he tried them on. I know it hurt his feelings and I feel terrible about it. So I decided that it was time to go home. He kept insisting and calling me names and telling me that, “everyone hates me because I overreact” “ I’m projecting” “he f*cking hated me”. I took his phone away, he told me I was “making him responsible for my feelings” and “I should let it slide” and just buy him the pants he wanted because the reason why people including him hated me is because there’s always give immediate consequences” , so I took his tv away. When we got home, he was persistent. He kept asking “why”, I would answer and he would insult me/mock me and follow me around the house. He didn’t stop so my 6 year son and I went  outside and played. When we came back I made dinner and we ate. My teen threw trash on the floor and looked at me to see if I would react (he likes to do this a lot). After dinner he started up again. He kept insulting me and my 6 year son told him to stop so my oldest told him to “shut the f up, little bit(h”. I realized that our vacation would be completely ruined if I bring my teen along. Whenever he doesn’t get his way, he makes sure no one has fun. Am I overreacting by not letting him come with us? I just want to have a nice experience with at least one of my kids. I know my teen wants to come, he has been looking forward to the trip for a long while now. After I told him that he wasn’t coming with us, he apologized but I think he just wanted his stuff back and to come with us to our vacation. I don’t know if I overreacted, I just wanted him to stop",0,1754029227.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.5,False
