1ikz1e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ikz1e2/my_grandfathers_teeth/,My Grandfather's Teeth,"The holidays are always an emotionally very confusing time for me. I love the decorations, the festive mood, but I also feel a melancholy nostalgia that lingers in the back of my mind. Not a yearning for younger times, but vague childhood trauma and family inadequacies bubbling to the surface. My sister and I individually still live in our hometown. My parents do too, and so did my grandparents. I have no desire to move, I do really like it here. That doesn’t mean though that I’m not affected by the proximity of parts of my past.

I practice Wicca in a modern, cultural sense. I was raised loosely Catholic, and I still celebrate Christmas. But I also celebrate the Wiccan sabbat of Yule which overlaps with Christmas. It’s nice to be able to have something to share while also having something for “yourself” to enjoy and experience. This year’s holidays were different though. Surprising, but not shocking, my grandfather died.

He was ninety-two, so his passing was not unexpected. Active and mentally alert up until the very end, but still, ninety-two. Just the timing of being so close to the holidays was not foreseen in the brief overview of planning for his passing that my parents, sister, and I happened to discuss earlier in the year. Getting funeral arrangements made for December 20th was a pain, but we got it done. We made it simple. A public wake and a private funeral. Of my family, I was the closest to my grandfather and I felt treating his death arrangements in a more logical, left brain matter just made sense and wasn’t insensitive at all. He would have wanted people to move on quickly and continue with their lives.

I learned of Wicca from my grandfather. Many people are surprised to hear that being Wiccan, or a witch, is not just some New Age fade. My grandmother was Wiccan too. My mother, their daughter, decided not to practice which is of course totally fine and her decision. I decided though that Wicca really aligned with my values and felt best for me. Cooking, especially baking is a main aspect of my practice. Since I was a kid my grandfather and I would bake together in his big kitchen. Savory or sweet galettes (depending on the season), witch’s bread pudding using buttery brioche bread, and much more. Nine out of ten times, we made perfect creations.

Wicca is very much individual-centered. While my grandfather and I practiced together, he also encouraged me to develop my own practice for myself as he did his own. When my grandmother died three years ago, it was nice to see that he had a “system” in place for himself to process the grief in a healthy way. What exactly that system was when he was alone, I’m unsure. But it worked for him.

Speaking of speedy death arrangements, I happened to get a call from my grandfather’s lawyer maybe 10 minutes after the funeral. He wanted to go over my grandfather’s will. He was able to arrange a meeting for my family and I to come into his office the following day. The convenience was very nice.

We all sat down in front of the attorney’s desk. “It’s honestly one of the most simplified wills I’ve ever been designated to carry out,” the lawyer said.

“As he stated in his will, you are already aware he is donating most of his money to charities and causes he cared deeply about. However, he left $10,000 total to divide amongst the four of you equally.” Thankfully, we all understood and acknowledged that we knew this well in advance. No one contested it. The lawyer handed each of us a check for $2,500. The lawyer proceeded.

“The only thing left is this.” The lawyer lifted up onto his desk a small, old wooden chest that was maybe a foot wide and half a foot tall. The dark brown of the wood was almost black, which matched the black metal of the hinges, lock, and corner edge plating.

“This is for you Zack.” The lawyer handed me the chest. My family looked at me inquisitively but said nothing. Right then and there I tried to open the chest, but it was locked.

“Is there a key?” I asked.

“No” the lawyer replied firmly. The lawyer then stated that my mother was designated as the executor of his “estate” or what would happen with the rest of his belongings like his home. That concluded the will distribution and the lawyer ushered us out the door because he assumingly had other things to do.

The plan was we would all get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at my parents’ house, which was normal for us, unfortunately. I drove back to my place. I put my keys down in the bowl by the door and took the chest into the kitchen where I placed it on the dining room table. I made myself a mug of herbal tea and then sat in front of the chest, thinking. Should I try to pick the lock? Do I try and pry it open?

I gently shook the chest. I couldn’t hear anything inside. Was it just decorative? That doesn’t seem like something my grandfather would leave in a will. Wicca tends to be utilitarian, and that’s how my grandfather was. Practical, but not in an emotionally detached way at all. He didn’t like giving or receiving gifts. He liked to show his care by providing experiences, acts of service, words of affection. Baking was a clear example of giving an experience of the senses.

I left the chest on the table and decided to light a fire in the fireplace. Some find it contradictory, or a dichotomy? I don’t know. Anyway, people find it weird that I use natural kindling from the woods but put one of those packaged logs you light on top of it. To continue the theme of Wicca, I think it’s a perfect representation of the practice. “Old” and “new” together. I lit the fire, and it immediately went up in a roar and then settled down. It’s a traditional fireplace, it doesn’t use major flammables like gas. The wood must have been really… dry? A moment after the fire settled, I heard a thud come from the kitchen. I got a little scared. Just in case, I grabbed the fire poker hanging near the fireplace and slowly walked to the kitchen.

Stepping into the kitchen I looked around. Nothing was there. The door that connected the garage to the kitchen that I normally walk through was closed, and so were the windows. I looked over at the dining room table and saw the chest. That, was open. I walked over to it and looked inside. I had to blink a few times to make sure nothing was in my eyes, and that what I was seeing was actually what I was seeing. There were eleven teeth scattered within the chest.

A shiver shot up my spine. Teeth? Real human teeth? How did I not hear at least a rattling when I shook the chest? The question in itself made me uncomfortable. Whose teeth were they? I had to assume they were my grandfather’s. Where else would he get human teeth? I thought of the worst possible scenario. Did he hurt someone to get these? I was just being paranoid in the moment. I never saw my grandfather get even remotely angry at anything. I don’t think I ever even saw him slightly irritated. Is that a good trait, or the trait of a psychopath?

I needed to calm down. I know my grandfather. Horribly, these had to be his teeth, and the coroner or funeral people didn’t notify us because, for some odd reason, they didn’t see his missing teeth as abnormal. Maybe they just thought he had poor dental hygiene? There was a part of me that wanted to pick them up and inspect them, but the shock was still subsiding in me, so I didn’t. 

It’s an old chest. It must have been spring-loaded and broken open. I left the open chest there and decided to bring my tea over to the couch near the fireplace and just relax. I would try reading a book I was almost done with and organize my thoughts about this discovery after. I decided not to tell my parents and sister. At least not so close to Christmas. Again, I already feel weird around my family this time of year. It’s not an emergency, and I wouldn’t want to sour their Christmas and create more tension just like I wouldn’t want my Yule shaken up like that. If I was going to tell them what Grandpa left me, I would wait until after the holidays.

Only three to five pages into reading, I started to smell a really pungent odor. It wasn’t bad-smelling, just really strong. It was cinnamon. I didn’t add anything to my tea. I thought maybe some of the wood I was burning could be producing a smell? I went over to the fireplace, but it wasn’t that. I remembered I had mini cinnamon brooms hanging outside each of my house’s doors. I thought that was ridiculous, because how could they suddenly become that strong in smell, but I checked anyway. 

I opened the front door and the cinnamon smell hit me like a wave. Yes, it was ever so clear that it was coming from the cinnamon brooms. When I bought them, you literally had to put your nose up to them to smell the slight scent they held. Now, it was as though the scent radiated off them like a nuclear reactor. I checked the one outside the connecting garage door, and it too was overwhelming.

For those that don’t know, in Wicca, it’s tradition to hang a cinnamon or spiced broom outside your door during the colder seasons’ sabbats, especially Samhain/Halloween and Yule. It’s a very contemplative time of the year. The brooms protect your home from “bad energy” and ground you in the physical realm while the veil between life and death is… thin. They’re symbolic. The same concept applied to lighting fires in the fireplace.

Whether you notice it or not, air circulates through homes constantly. Air pressure changes dramatically simply by opening and closing doors. My home is on the older side so I thought there must have been a particular draft where a wind was strongly wafting in the scent of the brooms toward my house and then through tight spaces even though the doors and windows were closed. I really couldn’t think of any other way. I went back to reading.

I finished my book. Albert Camus’ “The Fall.” I liked “The Stranger” better, but overall this was a good read too. It was around 9:00pm. The glowing fire had relaxed me with its light flickering within the room. However, that feeling left. My heart sank a little. I remembered I needed to do something with the chest of teeth. I turned and saw it on the table. With the lights off it mainly just looked like a darker black spot within an already dark room. I finished my tea which was cold at this point. I decided to just leave the chest there. I’ll get a good night’s sleep and figure out what to do with it tomorrow. I put out the fire with cold ashes, showered, and went to bed.

I jolted up, leaning forward in bed. I had woken up feeling panic. I checked my phone, it was 3:00am. There was silence. Did I have a nightmare? I took a few deep breaths. As I was going to lay back down, I heard a faint sound. It went away after a few seconds. I heard it again. I was certain it was the sound of children giggling. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from outside or somewhere inside the house.

I checked my phone again. I didn’t accidentally have any audio playing. I thought it must be the Alexa playing something downstairs. I got out of bed and the immediate feel of the cold wood floors on the bottoms of my feet added to the tension in the air. I have a semi-auto shotgun in my room’s gun locker but I felt getting it out would be excessive. I slowly made my way down the stereotypically creaky stairs.

Not even fully down the stairs I saw the red light from the Alexa which means I indeed did not forget to turn it off before bed. No sound was playing. The on-and-off sound of children giggling had stopped. The pungent smell of cinnamon still filled the air downstairs. I turned the living room and kitchen lights on and began to look around. On the kitchen counter next to the stove, my bag of baking flour for some reason was sitting there, open. The windows and doors were still closed and locked. I looked outside the front and back windows. No one was out there. Nothing was disturbed or out of place, minus the bag of flour being out. I then saw the chest on the counter, of course still sitting there.

I went over to it. I felt a desire to see its contents again, still not believing what the chest held. Looking inside, I saw it was completely empty. The teeth were gone. The doors and windows began to shake violently. I could hear the hinges rattling, but they stood strong. The child laughter came back loud. I realized the laughter was coming from outside the house, all around. It was utter chaos. It felt like a fever dream. Clearly, it was now not excessive to go get my shotgun. I ran upstairs, got it out of the safe, and ran back downstairs. I didn’t know where to look. The laughter was coming from the doors, the windows, the roof, everywhere, but I could see nothing. Then, as quickly as it came, it was silent. The doors and windows stopped shaking. The laughter stopped. The cinnamon smell dissipated. I stood there, in a sweat, holding my shotgun. I felt scared yet relieved at the same time. 

I don’t like the police. People roll their eyes at me when I say it, but I believe in community self-defense. I did not call them to report this, nor was I in the mood to go outside and investigate. Maybe this was a deranged, elaborate prank from neighborhood kids… who I didn’t know lived on this street. Maybe I was hallucinating. I went to the kitchen where I keep my medication to check that I hadn’t missed any doses, or taken more than I should have by accident. I happened to see the bottle of melatonin I recently bought. 10mg. Of course. I usually take 3mg tablets and only take melatonin occasionally. I must have not been paying attention when I bought it, and forgotten that I took some melatonin before bed and my body was reacting strangely negatively. I’m always sensitive like that. I literally have to stop drinking coffee at least eight to nine hours before bed because of the caffeine.

I double-checked the doors just to soothe my mind. They were still locked. So were the windows. I even checked the chimney shoot. That was closed too. I left everything as it was. The lights on, the flour bag, the chest, I just left it as is. I went back upstairs and put my gun away. I laid my head to rest. It took me about an hour to go back to bed, but I eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I showered, got dressed, and went downstairs. Everything was fine. The lights were off and the flour bag was in the kitchen cupboard. The doors and windows were still closed and locked. I made some coffee and went to head out to run some errands. Right as I was leaving, a thought entered my mind. The missing teeth. I went over to the chest and looked inside. The teeth were back where they were. Well, I figured they were always there. I figured everything was what and where it normally was. The melatonin just messed me up last night. I brushed it off and left the house.

I came back home about an hour and a half later. There were still some leaves falling from the trees from Fall, so I went outside and did some raking. The crisp, cold air was refreshing and cleared my lungs. I paused for a moment. It was a nice feeling, but the air had a tension to it. No, more so a very slight vibration. A presence. An anticipation lingering in the background. I chopped it up to the weird seasonal imbalance. Fall holding on tight, not letting Winter fully sink in. Climate destruction making every year warmer. I finished raking, put the paper bags of leaves on the curb, and went inside.

I made another fire in the fireplace and got cozy with a new book. It got dark quickly. Shortly into reading, the fire did a roar. It was the same quick blaze that occurred when I lit it the day before but now just on its own, not right when I lit it. I thought that I needed to be more careful with the wood I chose because it was getting dangerous. Maybe 30 seconds after that, the giggling started. The children’s laughter slowly began to surround the house. I quickly accepted that this wasn’t last night’s excuse I told myself. This wasn’t me. This was real.

I got up and headed toward the front door to investigate when my grandfather’s box on the table, which I continued to not do something about, began to shake in its place. I slowly walked up to it. It shook violently. The teeth, again, were gone. The doors and windows began to shake again. The children’s laughter grew and got louder. The scent of the cinnamon brooms became overwhelming. I ran upstairs and grabbed my gun. When I came back downstairs, rushed to the door, and almost turned the doorknob, something stopped me. I felt a sudden feeling that stopped me in my place “telling” me not to open the door. A part of me wanted to proceed, but I continued to feel the sudden emotion guiding me to stay inside. Do not open the door.

I walked backward to the center of the room and just stood there. I let everything just occur. The fire roared again but continued blazing instead of the one-quick burst it had done twice before. The chest shook even more violently, and so did the doors and windows. The stench of the cinnamon stung my nostrils. The children’s laughter increasingly became deeper and deeper until it sounded purely demonic. It was booming all throughout the outside of the house. I just stood there. I stood in my place and protected my home. If it, whatever it was, came inside, I would defend myself. I had no other choice.

I yelled into the ether. ""Stop!... Stop right now! You- You aren't welcome here! You will not come in! You will not. come. in!""

Amongst the cacophony, another sound did manage to make itself known. The short, clear ding of my oven’s timer. As it did its single ring, everything stopped. The fire went back to normal. The chest, doors, and windows stopped shaking. The cinnamon scent died off. The laughter was gone. I went back over to the chest, and the teeth had returned. It was all over. What was also there was the bag of flour, back on the kitchen counter.

For the rest of the Yule season, I left the chest open on the table. The day Yule ended, I closed the chest and put it on the shelf in the living room closet. My grandfather taught me when I was younger of the Yule children. Some Wiccan cultures like witches in Iceland call them the “Yule Lads.” I was always taught of them as strictly a symbolic tale to uplift the idea of protective energy in your home. I was told the group of at least thirteen “mischievous” children were from a witch couple that practiced “dark magic.” They were supposedly the souls of children who did not pass over due to random accidents or unexplained reasons, from parents of those in a nearby village of the witches who lived in the woods or mountains (depending on which recollection). The witches would call to the spirits to stay with them, and these thirteen did. Eventually, the witch couple suddenly died. It is said they sacrificed themselves to some entity, unknown.

I had Christmas with my family and went back to my normal life. What else could I do? Call the police? What I experienced was what I experienced. It was real. People experience supernatural events all the time. Some true, and some fake or misinterpreted. This was no Wiccan myth. Instead, I saw it as a positive and profound event that, if anything, confirmed for myself my spiritual practice even more. It was a miracle. Months passed, and Halloween season came around. My favorite sabbat, Samhain.

I was in the kitchen baking to really bring a warm feeling to the home on a chilly Fall night. I could hear the wind rustling the leaves outside. It was really nice. I put the dish into the oven and set the timer. Then, the sound of slight shaking occurred. I walked into the living room to see where the sound was coming from. I listened, it was coming from the closet. I walked over to the closed closet door. Yes, it was coming from inside. I knew it was the chest. It had to be.

I just stood there. I didn’t know what to do. Do I bring the chest back out on the table? Do I leave it where it is and let whatever happens, happen? I just really didn’t know what to do. I still don’t know what to do with my Grandfather’s teeth.",1,1739052408.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We have had our ups and downs mainly due to family but this last year or so has made me see that if I don’t fix myself it’s all over. We got out of a shitty situation near the tail end of 2023 and moved into our own place. I’m not the cleanest person in the world but have been working on it. I work full time 50-60 hours a week while she works part time. I pay for all the bills other than her car and insurance. Lately I feel like between not getting along with the 5 year old all the time and not doing things like the dishes my relationship is coming crashing down. It doesn’t help that her dad has moved in with us in our tiny 2 bed room apartment. Her main complaints are the she feels that everyone relies on her and that she does all the house work. 

While my main complaint is that I work so much and everything falls on me if I can’t work. Then comes the bills with our rent almost being $2700 a month and having to do a consumer proposal last year before we got kicked out I’m always stressed about money and work. 

She claims I spend to much money while she goes and buys coffees like it’s the end of the world even after I bought her a coffee maker. With that being said she’s a great mother and most of the time a great partner but a really bad communicator. While I’m not the best if I ask her what’s wrong I get told not to worry about it. So I guess how do I save this relationship? Is it all my fault like it feels like? I’ve been trying to be patient with her and my son but it also goes two ways I feel like it’s all coming to a end even though I don’t want it to but I’m at a loss.

1ikyxq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1ikyxq6/amway_and_other_mlms_are_operating_under/,Amway and other MLMs are operating under different “business” names to hide their identity,"Due to the negative reputation of MLMs, their consultants are operating their “businesses” under a different name.  Ex. Empowered top level marketing/high ticket development/insert generic business name here.  These businesses appear to be a startup or independent small business, but are actually part of a large corporation.

A random overly nice stranger will approach you in public, give you compliments, and act like your friend.  It’s the friend version of “love bombing,” so you could call it “like bombing.”  Sometimes they will cut to the chase and talk vaguely about a business opportunity, but due to the awareness of MLMs they will often act like it’s just hanging out.  

They will try to recruit you for an “e-commerce” business.  They will not share the name and are extremely vague about what the “business”actually does.  It is almost always coffee, then a zoom interview.  

They will act like they set aside time out of their busy schedule to interview you, but TBF they also brag about barely ever working.  You will be given homework which includes answering a few questions, and to read Business of the 21st Century by Robert Kiyosaki.  

Before I accepted the interview I thought this was a position for an actual online store.  But as I talked to them, the more it got weird.  It was clear that this wasn’t about an online store, the interview was mostly about affiliate and network marketing.  I googled the book to find a summary before I read it, and immediately this solidified my suspicions.  The first page on Google already shows thousands of stories of people who went through the exact same process I did.  It was obvious through comments that this was the Amway routine.  The book promotes the concept of multi level marketing.  I had to ask more than once to get the business name, but they did not tell me it was affiliated with an MLM. 

After the interview, I asked if (insert generic business name here) was affiliated with Amway.  I got a call saying they were not expecting my question, but they admitted it was Amway.  I told them I did not want to join an MLM.  They called because they did not like to text, but I had a feeling they didn’t want me to screenshot anything.  

They asked what I associate with MLMs, and I said I knew people who had been taken advantage of by them.  The book was written by a man who is 1 billion dollars in Bankruptcy.  Neither Kiyosaki or Donald Trump have been in an MLM.  They also promote owning the actual corporation, but neither of them would be a consultant themselves.  

They told me the negative press is from people who have been unsuccessful, but they did not argue with me.  Chances are they’ve had this conversation before.  Despite them telling me I was smart, I find it funny that their recruitment strategy involves people who do not know how to use Google.  This was also supposed to be a three week process because it takes a long time for them to trust people, but I am not trustworthy enough to know the name of their actual business or the corporation behind it.  

They respected my decision, chances are they have had this conversation before.  I know a lot of nice people who have been involved in MLMs, they probably were taken advantage of.  The sad part is with MLMs you can never tell who is genuinely a good person or if that friend you have know for years is still your friend.  But I am posting this to tell you to please beware of the Amway scam.  I was already aware of MLMs and the lingo/recruitment tactics, but after experiencing an attempted recruitment myself, it is very much like they are reading from a script.

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1ikyvtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ikyvtr/unsure_if_i_should_keep_in_contact_with_my_ex/,Unsure if I should keep in contact with my ex,"My boyfriend (M18) of 2 years broke up with me almost a few weeks ago. I haven’t handled it well at all and I begged him to stay the first week or so but he barely checked in on me or anything. We didn’t have the best relationship in the last few months and we weren’t perfect to each other though he was mostly in the wrong. He never texts me or asks me how I’m doing and doesn’t seem to wanna keep in contact really, though after the breakup he agreed to meet me once a week for coffee for an hour. So every week we’ve been meeting up and of course I agree to it because I’m desperate to see him and still love and want him. It’s embarrassing but the first time I wrote him a long handwritten letter telling him how much he means to me. I gave it to him and I tried to talk about how badly I’ve been doing since the breakup and how depressed I’ve become and how much I want him back in my life but he refuses to talk about our relationship and just wants to meet to talk normally. We met again today and it was the same situation, me trying to express my feelings and him quickly becoming angry and refusing to listen. This is very hard for me because I don’t really have anything else to talk about with him, whilst he’s telling me about his friends and his new job and uni life. I don’t have a job and don’t know what I want to with my life yet and don’t really have any friends either. He was my best friend and I truly believed he was my purpose and loving him was what I lived for and now I’ve lost everything and have never felt more alone or betrayed. I can’t imagine him out of my life, he’s my first everything and I thought what we had was so intimate and cannot be replaced and I can’t see a future without him, which is why I’ve agreed to see him next week again. I know this is the wrong thing to do but I’m so obsessed with him that I can’t not see him. There’s no hope of us getting back together even though I suggest it, he says he’s made his final decision. I’m guessing he’s agreed to meet up because he wants to stay friendly for a while, but he never messages me and barely shows interest. It’s definitely one sided and when we do meet up I look at him with so much love and longing and he just doesn’t seem to care and it’s really tough because I keep thinking of all the things we did together that now mean nothing to him. He admits that he can’t be the person for me and that he just doesn’t care anymore. But part of me still wants to see him and be friends because he really was my best friend and I enjoy talking to him. But it’s hard when I want us to work and he doesn’t.",2,1739051999.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1ikyumx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuigiLore/comments/1ikyumx/update_to_my_previous_post_why_did_the_suspect/,"UPDATE to my previous post, ""Why did the suspect allegedly take a taxi far out of his way?""","UPDATE to my prior post: ""Why did the suspect allegedly take a taxi far out of his way?""

Apparently, the suspect took couple of additional steps in this already circuitous route. Plus, I've added (1) the leg down to Penn Station; and (2) the “around the block” circle the taxi would’ve needed to take (on the leg from 86^(th) Street and Columbus to 2372 Amsterdam), in order to wind up pointing *south,* as seen in the outside-the-taxi photos of Taxi Guy. (The fact that the taxi was pointing south was something I hadn’t noticed at the time of my prior post. I also failed to notice that, in that same photo, the suspect was walking south, away from the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, which was supposed to be his destination.) I've included maps with estimated times below in and in the comment and replies.

I was alerted to these additional steps by a video that allegedly shows the suspect walking north past the Hilltop Pharmacy at 593 Fort Washington Avenue, just south of 187th Street.

As reported in a [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/nyregion/uhc-shooting-gunman-getaway-bike.html), according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny, this video was taken AFTER the alleged sighting of the suspect, approximately at 7:30AM, at the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal. (The authorities have provided no images or video for that alleged 7:30AM sighting.) Here's a quote from the NYT article:

""Initially, investigators theorized that the man who shot Mr. Thompson had left New York on a bus from a terminal in Washington Heights. Cameras captured the man entering the bus depot on West 178th Street at about 7:30 a.m., but not leaving.

After fleeing Midtown on the bike in the early morning, the gunman hailed a cab at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and traveled to the bus station, paying the fare in cash.

*But surveillance camera footage reviewed more recently by investigators showed him leaving the bus depot by* ***subway****. The gunman* ***walked*** *from the bus terminal to the 190th Street station, and from there he took the A train downtown train downtown to Pennsylvania Station, police said. A camera in a subway elevator captured his movements, Chief Kenny said* \[emphasis added\].”

There are a few problems with the Hilltop Pharmacy video, NY Times article and Chief Kenny's statement.

**First problem**: The Hilltop Pharmacy video has no date/timestamp. It's therefore possible this video was taken *BEFORE* the alleged 7:30AM sighting at the Bus Terminal. If so, it would destroy LE's timeline. As shown in the map below, it takes at least \~21 minutes to walk from the suspect's prior alleged location (2372 Amsterdam Avenue, between 177th and 178th Streets) to this new alleged location (the Hilltop Pharmacy at 593 Fort Washington Avenue). (I say ""at least,"" because, as noted above, in the photo of Taxi Guy walking outside the taxi at 2372 Amsterdam, he's headed *south,* toward 177th Street, so he was headed in the *opposite* direction of both the Bus Terminal and the Hilltop Pharmacy.) It takes another 10 minutes to walk from 593 Fort Washington Avenue back down to the Bus Terminal. (See map in the first reply.) That would add 31 minutes to the total journey from the point where the suspect allegedly caught the cab at \~7:04AM (86th Street and Columbus) to the Bus Terminal, where he was allegedly sighted at \~7:30AM. Previously, I had used Google Maps to estimate this journey at \~27 minutes (giving LE a huge benefit of the doubt by refraining from taking rush-hour traffic into account). But with these two extra steps (to get up to the Hilltop Pharmacy and back), you'd need to add \~31 minutes to the original \~27 minutes, for a total of \~58 minutes. He would've arrived at the Bus Terminal at \~8:02AM. Impossible to get there by 7:30AM. Timeline, bye.

But, despite the lack of a date/timestamp, let's give Chief Kenny the benefit of the doubt, and grant him that the Hilltop video was taken *AFTER* 7:30AM. As shown in the same map in the first reply below, it takes approximately 10 minutes to walk from the Bus Terminal to the Hilltop Pharmacy (the same amount of time to walk in either direction, according to Google, even though the route north is uphill), so the suspect would've been caught on video there at \~7:40AM. (I've used terrain maps here, because this area is definitely the ""heights"" part of Washington Heights, very hilly, and although this doesn’t affect Google's time estimates, it may come up later and it's probably a good, “boots-on-the-ground” fact to bear in mind.)

Anyway, according to Kenny, the suspect continued walking north another few blocks past the Hilltop Pharmacy to the 190th Street Subway Station. As shown in the map below, the entire trip from the Bus Terminal to the 190th Street Subway Station would take approximately 17 minutes, so he would've arrived at \~7:47AM. (In an odd quirk of NYC geography, the “190th Street Subway Station” is located about four blocks north of 190th Street, at the equivalent of \~194th Street. The cross streets stop at 190th Street on Fort Washington Avenue, probably because the terrain is so hilly. Also, Google Maps doesn't recognize the subway station as a location, and the closest address I could find to input into Google Maps was 735 Fort Washington Avenue, which is maybe 20-30 yards north of the subway station. Using the exact longitude/latitude for the subway station yields the same 17-minute estimate, but results in Google converting the displayed address to ""190 St, Bennett Ave, New York, NY 10040,"" which I think could be confusing, because Bennett Avenue is a block further east of Fort Washington Avenue. Anyway, see the map in the reply below for this 17-minute estimate.)

Next, according to Kenny, at the 190th Street Station, the suspect rode the elevator down to the platform and took an A Train down to Penn Station. Google Maps estimated travel time on the A Train on a Wednesday as 26 minutes. (See map in the reply below.) He arrived at \~7:47AM. Let's say he had to wait 10 minutes for a train to arrive. That puts him in Penn Station about 36 minutes later, at \~8:23AM.

Which bring us to a **second problem,** namely that, in walking to the 190th Street Subway Station, the suspect would've walked right past the 181st Street Subway Station. Both the 190th Street Station and the 181st Street Station are local stations on the A Train. Google estimates the trip from 181st Street as the same 26 minutes as the trip from 190th Street (see map below). So, he would've walked another nine blocks north, just to go to a totally fungible local subway station, and then add that same nine blocks of distance to his subway trip back down south to Penn Station. (When any New Yorker can tell you about the constant dread of subway trains stopping between stations for no reason at any time, and how you therefore never want to add even two inches to your subway trip.)

A **third** **problem** is right there in that NY Times quotation above. In its last paragraph, the first sentence contradicts the second. The first sentence says that surveillance video reviewed by “investigators” showed the suspect leaving the Bus Terminal by *subway.* The second sentence says that, according to “police,” the suspect *walked* from the Bus Terminal to the 190th Street Station. Which is it? Subway or walking?

Are the “investigators” different people from the “police,” as in maybe FBI agents? Is this another example of conflicting stories between the NYPD and the Feds? Or just inconsistent statements from the NYPD? What would NYPD detectives themselves say about such inconsistent statements, if they came from a suspect?

A **fourth problem** is that this new “Hilltop Pharmacy” video greatly exacerbates the original problem that this route is illogically circuitous, lengthy, and exposed to cameras. Let’s review what this suspect escaping after assassinating a billionaire on a public street in Manhattan is alleged to have done:

· Commit the crime, reportedly at \~6:44AM or \~6:45AM (video clip, no date/time stamp).

· Jog north from 54^(th) Street to 55^(th) Street (photo, no date/timestamp).

· Presumably unlock and then hop on the e-bike (no image).

· E-bike east, the wrong way down a one-way street, to the corner of 55^(th) Street & Sixth Avenue (screengrab, no date/time stamp).

· E-bike north from 55^(th) and Sixth to 59^(th) Street and Sixth; wait at a red light; enter Central Park via the Center Drive (three NewsNation video clips, one with a running date/time stamp that starts at 6:44:51AM).

· Possibly ditch a TJ Maxx bag containing navy-blue clothing and “something heavy” in a “wooded area” either near the Chess and Checkers House (at the equivalent of about 64^(th) Street and Sixth Avenue) or just south of the 65^(th) Street Transverse, far to the west near Central Park West (no image, except of the bag when found later).

· E-bike, partly on pedestrian pathways, north and east to the foot of the southern staircase of the Wisteria Pergola east of the Naumburg Bandshell (at the equivalent of about 71st Street and Sixth Avenue), lay down the bike, shrug out of the Peak Design backpack, doff the Starbucks jacket (a half-zip and therefore a pullover) by pulling it over his head, either already be wearing the puffer under the Starbucks jacket or remove the black puffer jacket from the backpack and don it, stuff the Starbucks jacket into the backpack, casually walk up the staircase, maybe set the backpack on the wall’s coping for a moment and, even more casually let the backpack slide over the side of the wall (no image). (I don’t think the suspect would’ve changed out of his jacket under an evergreen shrub on the ground next to the staircase, because this would’ve entailed e-biking further out of his way on pedestrian pathways, hopping a wrought-iron fence designed to keep people out, and clambering uphill over rocks to reach that location. It would’ve been slower and more awkward and would’ve constituted odd behavior that would’ve called attention to himself.)

· Jog back down the stairs, get back on the e-bike, and bike north and west to 77^(th) Street and Central Park West, reportedly arriving at 6:56 a.m. (screengrab, no date/time stamp).

· E-bike west along 85^(th) Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, reportedly arriving at Columbus by 6:58 (Nest video clip, no date/time stamp).

· Ditch the e-bike somewhere between the Nest-video spot on 85^(th) Street between Central Park West and Columbus and 86^(th) Street and Columbus (no image).

· Hail a taxi at 86^(th) Street and Amsterdam, entering the cab reportedly at \~7:04AM (no image).

· Take the taxi to 2372 Amsterdam between 177^(th) and 178^(th)  Streets (far north and east), possibly braving rush-hour traffic on I-95 and, at the end, going all the way around the block so that taxi winds up pointing south, no arrival time reported (three photos, no date/time stamps on the inside-the-taxi shot or the two outside-the-taxi shots). Note: Although the taxi ride starts and ends on Amsterdam Avenue, another quirk of NYC geography causes Amsterdam to run diagonally far to the east side of the island, and the need to avoid traffic and multiple red lights causes one to travel to the far west of the island, travel north up the West Side Highway, then cross the island back to the east side again via I-95, and head back south again to Amsterdam. (Alternatively, one could exit the West Side Highway just before I-95 and take the back roads, but this would add 6-8 minutes to the trip.) See maps in the replies below.

· Start to walk further south on Amsterdam, toward 177^(th) Street, no time reported (one of the same outside-the-taxi photos, no date/time stamp).

· Turn around and walk north and west for \~9 minutes to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, entering at 178^(th) Street between Broadway and Fort Washington Avenue reportedly at 7:30 a.m. (no image).

· Come back out of the GWB Bus Terminal, either on foot or via subway for just one stop and three blocks, to the 181^(st) Street Subway Station, no time reported (no image).

· Walk past the Hilltop Pharmacy at 187^(th) Street and Fort Washington Avenue, walking past the 181^(st) Street Subway Station, if the suspect left the Terminal on foot, no time reported (video clip, no date/time stamp).

· Walk to the 190^(th) Street Subway Station, Fort Washington Avenue entrance, at about 194^(th) Street. Descend the stairs and enter the station on the Upper Mezzanine level. Take the elevator down to the subway platform on the Lower Mezzanine, no time reported (no image).

· Take the A Train down to Penn Station, no arrival time reported (no image).

· Take an Amtrak train to Philadelphia, no departure time reported (no image).

In short, this convoluted trip seems like wholly illogical behavior for someone escaping after a high-profile murder. Lots of people defend the illogic by claiming he was serpentining. But any benefit from serpentining was far outweighed by the benefit from leaving NYC, and preferably the state, asap. Bridge or tunnel to New Jersey or Connecticut. Among the alternate explanations are that Taxi Guy was a random local person, who took a cab from 86^(th) Street and Amsterdam to 2372 Amsterdam on some unknown date and time, and was heading south because he *wasn’t* going to GWB Bus Terminal but to some other location to the south. And that the shooter was not the same person as the e-bikers at 55^(th) and Sixth or 77^(th) and Central Park West to 85^(th) between Central Park West and Columbus, or the person seen passing the Hilltop Pharmacy. That NYC is filled with young guys wearing dark hoodies, dark pants and black sneakers with white soles.

I originally thought there was another problem, based on reports by other redditers that the Fort Washington Avenue entrance to the 190^(th) Street Station and/or the elevator down to the subway platform had been closed for more than a year. But thanks to a friend who texted me some photos, I’ve confirmed that, at least as of now, the entrance and elevator are open (see photos in the replies). But, it’s still possible that the entrance and elevator were closed back on 12/4/2024, so I’ll leave this here as a “maybe.”  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/190th_Street_station) says that the elevator that leads from the station's stone head house (see photo in the replies) to the platform were taken out of service in 2020, that construction was supposed to be completed in 2021, and that it was pushed back due to delays. (Looking into the question also led me into a fascinating historical rabbit hole about the this colorful and atmospheric station, and the local-politics foofaraws in which the residents battled valiantly to have the fares removed from elevators, so that they could use them even when not taking the subway, to avoiding walking up an eight-story hill. They eventually won in 1957. I'll post an evocative photo of the Art Deco lighted ""SUBWAY"" sign above the staircase leading from Fort Washington Avenue down to the platform where you can get the elevator.  So if it was all based on an error, at least it was interesting!) Anyway, if this subway station was indeed closed on 12/4/2024, then the suspect couldn't have used it to take the A Train down to Penn Station. And note that Kenny specifically said that ""A camera *in a subway elevator* captured his movements."" So the elevator specifically would need to have been operational on 12/4/2024.

Here's the first map, showing the 21-minute walk from 2372 Amsterdam to the Hilltop Pharmacy:

I don't drink tap water. I tried the large capacity Zero water for a while but was going through filters pretty quickly. That's when I started just refilling 5 gallon jugs at Whole Foods and I purchased a rechargeable pump that fits in top and pumps out water from Amazon. After a year of lugging these 5 gallon jugs out of the store, into my car and into the house, (water weighs approximately 8 lbs per gallon)I'm over it. I toyed with a gravity fed filter such as Doulton or a similar brand, but then started thinking I might do better with a countertop RO. I researched and settled on the SimPure Y7P. Got a pretty good deal on it from their website including an extra set of filters. I received it, but haven't set it up yet. It's just me and my 6 lb dog, lol, and I'll use it for our drinking water, coffee, etc. I guess I'm looking for confirmation that this is a good unit that will work for me.  I'm kind of worried about the pure water tank only being a little less than half a gallon.

1ikysi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITApod/comments/1ikysi4/aita_for_not_personally_informing_my_dad_every/,AITA for not personally informing my dad every time we run out of milk?,"I (21) am currently living with my parents at home to save on room and board for college. I am a full-time student, work 20+ hours a week, and consistently contribute to household chores and tasks.

As a family we drink a lot of milk and go through it pretty fast. My mom (53F) has always been the one to get the groceries, but since I got my license in high school, I have as well. It is rare for my dad to get family groceries.

My dad (50M) is very picky about food, and for as long as I can remember, gets very upset if he doesn't have the right drink with his food. If we have pizza, he needs Coca-Cola, if we have any dessert, he needs milk. Growing up, when we ran out of one of these drinks, it would upset him. Sometimes he would slam the front door as he left, sometimes he would leave without a word. My mom was always hurt by it, and it always confused me. Why couldn't he just drink water?

Well it snowed bad this week but I was able to dig my car out of the snow and pick up some drink items. I got juice and some milk.

Fast-forward to yesterday. Mom got sick, but works remote. We ran out of milk as well as other items making breakfast and coffee, so I updated our grocery app. I get out to my car and it won't start. She was running a meeting, so I text to let them know I needed to take her car, which was fine with her. It's 9:00, and my dad is still asleep, he was off work.

It's 11:30, I've been enjoying a lovely day at work. My dad hadn't responded to any of the family messages, but I receive this text from him:

""Can you please let me know when you drink the last of the milk so I can plan accordingly for my meals?""

He hadn't acknowledged my car troubles or that I was at work. He woke up 4 hours after the rest of us on his day off, which is fine. I respond:

""Hello, good morning to you too. I understand that you're frustrated, mom or I are planning to go to the grocery store after work today. I made it to work safely and am having a nice day :) Hope you enjoy your day off”

His response:

""I'm sorry if that sounded rude. I didn't mean for it to. I would really like your help with that **issue**. I'm glad you made it safe to work, have a good day.""

Fair enough. I followed up by sharing the updates I made to our grocery app. **But Reddit, this is what I wanted to say to him:**

**""Thank you. I'm not sure what the issue is. I was raised to not cry over spilled milk. I am not responsible for helping you plan your meals. When we run out of my favorite drinks, I drink water and go on with my day because they are a luxury, not an essential to survive. That's more than most people have in this world, and I'm grateful. Are you?""**

I always want to give the benefit of the doubt, and be open to the idea that I am missing something. But I feel like there's something wrong with this behavior.

I haven’t handled it well at all and I begged him to stay the first week or so but he barely checked in on me or anything. We didn’t have the best relationship in the last few months and we weren’t perfect to each other though he was mostly in the wrong. He never texts me or asks me how I’m doing and doesn’t seem to wanna keep in contact really, though after the breakup he agreed to meet me once a week for coffee for an hour. So every week we’ve been meeting up and of course I agree to it because I’m desperate to see him and still love and want him. It’s embarrassing but the first time I wrote him a long handwritten letter telling him how much he means to me. I gave it to him and I tried to talk about how badly I’ve been doing since the breakup and how depressed I’ve become and how much I want him back in my life but he refuses to talk about our relationship and just wants to meet to talk normally. We met again today and it was the same situation, me trying to express my feelings and him quickly becoming angry and refusing to listen. This is very hard for me because I don’t really have anything else to talk about with him, whilst he’s telling me about his friends and his new job and uni life. I don’t have a job and don’t know what I want to with my life yet and don’t really have any friends either. He was my best friend and I truly believed he was my purpose and loving him was what I lived for and now I’ve lost everything and have never felt more alone or betrayed. I can’t imagine him out of my life, he’s my first everything and I thought what we had was so intimate and cannot be replaced and I can’t see a future without him, which is why I’ve agreed to see him next week again. I know this is the wrong thing to do but I’m so obsessed with him that I can’t not see him. There’s no hope of us getting back together even though I suggest it, he says he’s made his final decision. I’m guessing he’s agreed to meet up because he wants to stay friendly for a while, but he never messages me and barely shows interest. It’s definitely one sided and when we do meet up I look at him with so much love and longing and he just doesn’t seem to care and it’s really tough because I keep thinking of all the things we did together that now mean nothing to him. He admits that he can’t be the person for me and that he just doesn’t care anymore. But part of me still wants to see him and be friends because he really was my best friend and I enjoy talking to him.

1ikyqje,https://www.reddit.com/r/TastefulCoffee/comments/1ikyqje/hamilton_beach_80393_coffee_grinder_review_sleek/,"Hamilton Beach 80393 coffee grinder review: sleek design, versatile grind settings, and durability tested","Using the Hamilton Beach 80393 coffee grinder has been an interesting journey. This black, compact machine promises to deliver freshly ground coffee with ease, and I’ve made it a staple in my kitchen for a few months now. Its design is simple yet modern, with a polished black exterior that fits seamlessly into my countertop setup. The grinder is lightweight at just under 2 pounds, making it easy to move around, but it doesn’t feel flimsy. The stainless steel blades add a touch of durability, ensuring it can handle frequent use.

One of the first things that caught my attention was the removable grinding chamber, which makes pouring and cleaning hassle-free. I’ve used grinders before where cleaning was a nightmare, but this one simplifies the process. It’s also equipped with a cord storage compartment, keeping my counter tidy. The grind settings are another standout feature, allowing customization from coarse to fine grinds. Whether I’m brewing French press coffee or crafting a strong espresso, this grinder adapts effortlessly.

[Check Hamilton Beach 80393 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-80393-coffee-grinder-review-b0743stl26/)

The grinding performance is impressive for its price range. I tested it with various coffee bean types, and the results were consistent. The grinder uses stainless steel blades, which, while not as precise as burr grinders, still deliver uniform grounds for everyday coffee drinkers. It’s worth noting that superfine grinds might produce dust, but for medium and coarse grinds, I found it reliable. I even experimented with grinding spices like cardamom and black pepper; it handled those well without retaining odors.

Operating the grinder is straightforward. The one-touch operation is perfect for quick use, and the auto shut-off feature ensures I don’t have to babysit the machine. There’s a visible grind level indicator inside the chamber, which eliminates guesswork when choosing portions for up to 14 cups of coffee. However, the lid can be a bit tricky to align and lock. It took me a few attempts to figure it out, but once I got the hang of it, it wasn’t an issue. I do see where some reviews mentioned the lid breaking or unlocking due to vibration—something to be mindful of.

**Pros**

1. Compact and stylish design with cord storage for a clutter-free counter.
2. Multiple grind settings suitable for French press, drip coffee, and espresso.
3. Removable grinding chamber simplifies cleaning and pouring.
4. Quiet operation compared to other grinders in this range.
5. Versatile enough for grinding coffee beans and spices.

**Cons**

1. Lid alignment and locking mechanism could be more intuitive.
2. Produces coffee dust with superfine settings, which may require extra cleaning.
3. Overheats slightly after multiple consecutive uses.
4. Blade mechanism lacks the precision of burr grinders.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Comparing the Hamilton Beach 80393 to competitors like the Cuisinart DBM-8 and Krups Fast Touch, it holds its ground well. The Cuisinart offers a burr grinding mechanism, delivering more precise grinds but at a higher price point. The Krups grinder is similarly priced but lacks the multiple grind settings and removable chamber, making the Hamilton Beach more versatile. However, if you’re a die-hard espresso fan, a burr grinder might be a better investment for finer grinds.

For casual coffee drinkers or those who need a multi-purpose grinder, the Hamilton Beach strikes a balance between affordability and functionality. It edges out competitors in ease of cleaning and quiet operation, which are often overlooked but essential features.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While I won’t mention exact pricing, this grinder offers excellent value for its features. It’s not the cheapest option, but the combination of grind settings, ease of use, and removable parts makes it worth considering. Stainless steel blades are durable, and the removable chamber adds convenience, which justifies spending a bit more compared to budget grinders. If longevity is a concern, some reviews mention it lasting years with proper care. For occasional users or families, this grinder is a practical choice without breaking the bank.

The features are well thought out. The hands-free grinding button is a blessing for multitasking mornings, while the portion control system ensures I don’t grind more beans than necessary. I appreciate the included brush for cleaning, even though I rarely use it because the chamber washes easily. If anything, the grind consistency could be slightly better, but that’s nitpicking for what is essentially a blade grinder.

Even our beginning was rocky as I suffer from Depression,BPD, and Anxiety ,but I’m also nonbinary. We met in University in a class. At first it was just all a crush and then one day he came up to me and we started talking from there. Thing is, from the beginning he didn’t really know if he wanted to be with me romantically and would often make fun of me for being a hopeless romantic and kind to everyone. He is kind of cynical. He comes from a rough background and is from the army so he has his problems but I was willing to work with him as I was slowly starting to fall in love with him yet I didn’t exactly know how he felt. Every time I tried to bring up the subject about his feelings towards me he would get mad. So I just refused to ask and speculate. Eventually he came around and we started dating. It was fine but I always scared to prod too much about anything as I didn’t want to anger him. I was on the verge of breaking up with him many times. It took him a while to open up to me ,but as he became more comfortable around me, I became uncomfortable around him. There was a time after a trip to a Rave that we were in harmony together ,but then it kind of escalated. He would get angry over many things I do and how I do them. For example, I would be confused about how to use a scanner to get into a gated community and he would get irritated and scream at me if I didn’t do it fast enough or the way he would. Anything I would do, a small action that he didn’t agree with, he would roll his eyes. Another thing is, when I ask for clarification on something by he would say “I don’t understand why I have to explain this to you” or “We are not talking about this right now”. This kind of behavior slowly made me feel disconnected to him and eventually made me more distant as I felt like I had to protect myself around him. He claims he doesn’t see how it’s hurting me. And he always says he never means to hurt me but I find this behavior toxic and disrespectful. We had a major argument about 1.5 weeks ago and I had had enough and I left and took my things. He texts me that night asking if we were over or if we needed space. Because he’s sad” I told him “I couldn’t keep losing myself by staying in the relationship and taking that kind of behavior where you don’t see your toxic traits”. He said he can’t change so I left it at that and he said he would reflect. A few days later we meet for coffee and he said he didn’t want to lose me and wanted me to be myself around him and such. He said he’d try to change. I said I’d work with him ,but now I’m having second thoughts. I’m scared. I don’t know who he is anymore and I don’t know if I’m being manipulated or if he’s just a guy with a few problems that can be fixed. Is it worth staying or will it be a temporary fix that will end up coming back? I need advice.",1,1739051592.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

**Flat white.** Extract 2 capsules at ristretto (25 ml) setting. Froth/steam 80-120 ml milk to low foam and pour onto coffee (plus or minus to your taste). You can make 1 capsule if you want (use about half the milk).

**Cappuccino.** Extract 1 capsule on espresso (40 ml). Froth/steam 80 ml milk to highest foam and pour onto coffee (plus or minus to your taste). You can make a larger cappuccino with 2 capsules and 150 ml milk.

**Latte.** Extract 1 capsule on espresso (40 ml). Froth/steam 100-200 ml milk to medium-low foam and pour onto coffee (plus or minus to your taste). Use 2 capsules and up to 250 ml milk if you want a big drink and it’s getting too weak for you with 1.

**Latte macchiato.** Same as latte except it’s much foamier (maximum foam) and you pour the steamed/frothed milk in first and then extract the coffee into it. Excellent in a tall clear glass.

**General Notes**

When I say ""extract 2 capsules"" that means use a second, fresh capsule for the second extraction (or a double espresso on VL).

When using syrups I use about 1 pump (1/4 ounce / 7.5 ml) per capsule (or a bit less). I like to put the syrup in first and extract the espresso onto it so it mixes well.

When I make a latte with the Aeroccino, it doesn't hold enough for frothing so I warm up 30-60 ml of milk in the microwave in my mug, extract the coffee into the warmed milk, and then pour on a full batch of Aeroccino foamed milk.

**Notes for Creatista Machines**

For Creatista machines, the milk jug holds between 150 and 250 ml, so for the smaller drinks you will not use all of the minimum amount. You could make two drinks at once or just discard the extra milk.

On the Creatista Plus the default milk steaming levels are set mostly according to the above foam level recommendations. I do prefer to increase the foam level above the default for cappuccino so the foam is stiffer. The flat white, cappuccino, and latte programs give the option to extract a second capsule after the milk if you need two. The only other setting that needs to be changed on Creatista Plus is to reduce the coffee extraction to the lowest level (25 ml) on the Flat White program.

**Vertuo Line notes**

On VL, you can use a double espresso capsule instead of two single espressos. On the newer VL machines (Next, Pop, Lattissima, and Creatista), you can also use “expert mode” by double pressing the button. This will turn a mug-size pod into a double espresso. It will turn a single espresso into a ristretto and a double espresso or gran lungo into something like a double ristretto.",1,1739051552.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I recently turned 20 years old and would like to start investing. I just have zero clue on what to do! It all seems so confusing and everyone has a different opinion. I genuinely just want something, at least for now, that I can just have money automatically go into and forget about. So when I'm 50/60 years old, I'll be like ""Holy shit! I have $4 million in investments!"" or something haha. I am sure someday I'll get more into stocks, but for now, I want something very long term as I have time on my side (being young). I would like to try and buy a house one day, but its nothing I can see myself doing for at least another 10/15 years. I just want to be financially free and be able to enjoy life, buy nice things occasionally or go on vacation. My goal is to one day hopefully buy a Porsche! Preferably before I'm a geezer. 

I currently have $10k in a RBC high interest savings account (that I would like to leave there as a nest egg/emergency fund). I also have $10k in a work pension plan (just a granite 2065 fund, rate of return has been very good (16.5%), but I truthfully never look at it). I take home about $1050 every 2 weeks. I earn $26.50 an hour working 24 hours a week. In the summer (May), when I am full-time, I will take home roughly $1400 every 2 weeks until I start school again in September. I am currently a first year college student (second semester now), but my grandmother very graciously is paying for my college. I live at home, with her. I do not pay rent. She is also paying for the insurance on my car and my phone (unsure if that may change this year). I have a good reliable new car. I do have to buy new summer tires though. My monthly expenses are about $650 ish (roughly $100 a week on groceries, $50 every 2 weeks on gas, $50 a month gym membership, $50 a month for coffee beans). I think in my 3rd year of college I'll have to move to on campus, so I am not sure if that's something to consider. My grandmother did pay for my brother to live on campus for one year, so I am not sure if she will do the same for me. 

I opened a WealthSimple account and I am thinking of having $300 come off my pay check automatically every 2 weeks for now. I could do more, but I think as a baseline, this is what I am comfortable with for now.  But just where do I invest the money?!?! Should I just have it all go into XEQT? Into a TFSA? What's best for long term, set and forget? I do also have a trip planned to central Europe for this May! I am hoping to do it rather budget, expecting the total trip for 20 days to set me back about $4k. ",1,1739051417.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,1,1.0,False

I was a carer, looking after a young man in his family home, he's non verbal amongst, being autistic and having a growth defect where he's incredibly small and unable to walk, he could roll or bunny hop on the floor, I absolutely adore him and treated him like my own little brother.

HIs family knew this and wanted me working 80+ hours a week as they could trust me. 

The issue is, his mum and dad are very vindictive people, they'll do anything to fuck people over. They just want to drag everyone down. I went through a lot of shit with them, for example I was losing weight for a photoshoot going from 110kg to 70kg. For the entire time, bare in mind I was doing 80+ hours a week, I had them constantly making jokes about calories, my weight or purposely offering me food knowing I couldn't eat it. 

I fully get this example isn't the best examples of the type of people they are but that's really not important.
They'd constant question me where I am on my time off, would refuse holidays as they couldn't cope without me and if I called them to see if everything was ok they'd accuse of calling to hand my notice in. 

So after a while of all the crap I was getting and goal posts being moved in how we need to do the job, my mind was all over the place and I was frustrated, coupled with the fact their son was so attached to me I couldn't leave his living room to go toilet or make a coffee without him causing harm to himself by grabbing at himself and pulling gastro tube out.

This went on for a year and half and I was trying to tell his mum about this to her telling me to figure it out. He would even create if I sat on sofa, which one day I managed to get him to accept me sitting on the sofa while he played with livingroom door, she came in and told him to tell me off because I wasn't allowed to be sitting down. 

Slowly over the next year and half my frustrations grew and grew, they would play on this. His mum said to me one day that my performances had dropped, despite the fact I got care plans sorted, health and safety sorted, got their son doing things he hadn't before and being there all them hours and being the one they can rely upon to even going on holidays. 

So one day I'm in the kitchen making a coffee and their son is creating a lot of fuss, I've said fuck sakes to myself, walked to the living room to comfort him, he starts creating again and I've slapped my thighs to distract him but also because I'm so frustrated and I'm tired. His mum, who was out shopping at the time, came home, went to her office, called in another carer, came into the house together and she went off on me accusing me of slapping their son. I was absolutely shocked as I couldn't believe she would think this of me.

I was dismissed, I walked home which I lived 5 minutes walk from theirs the other carer turned up and said that if I ask to go back, go to therapy then his mum would accept me back. This was all confusing to me.

I messaged his mum and asked to go back which was accepted, was told I'm no longer trusted and needs to build it back up but then I'm left alone with their son and even asked to come in on overtime so they can go to a BBQ. 

A week later I go to a festival with a mate who said to me to come down to where he lives to restart, which I decided to do. 

Once I was back, I stayed working there for a couple of weeks but things just weren't the same, so one day I phoned my clients mum to hand notice in, she weren't happy and a day later I had an email to say I was sacked. 

I moved to where my mate lives and got on with my life, then I had a police officer call to say ive been alleged to have beaten my client and to speak to police where I was. 

I was arrested, held in holding cells for 6 hours, questioned and then put on bail to have a magistrates court case. 

I went to court and there was no concrete evidence against me, just the audio, the police even rejected a picture they had submitted where their son had marks on his head, due to it being created by them. 

They've now got 1 month to hand in any other evidence and my trial case is set at end of the year. 

It's really stressful and I'm absolutely done in they'd think I would hit their son. Yes I can understand that if there's a sound that may sound like someone is being hit then you'd want to question this but I'm just done in.

If you want approximate ounces, divide ml by 30. These are written mostly for Original Line (OL) machines but many of them can work for Vertuo Line (VL).

Because these have no milk, the flavor of the espresso is extremely important, so choose carefully and experiment with different options.

These are listed in order of the degree of coffee flavor, from strongest to mildest.

**Ristretto.** Extract 1 capsule at ristretto size (25 ml). On OL, you can reprogram one button if you don’t have a ristretto button.

**Espresso.** Extract 1 capsule on espresso (40 ml) or 2 capsules for a double espresso (80 ml).

**Long Black/Americano.** For an OL machine, extract a blank shot or two (40 ml each), that is, a shot with no capsule. Then extract 1 capsule (40 ml). For VL, heat water separately.

**My version of an OL lungo.** For OL, set one of your buttons to dispense 60 ml. Extract one blank shot followed by 1 capsule of a strong variety (including the lungos). I do not think any of the capsules taste good past 60 ml.

**My version of an OL cup of coffee.** For OL, set one of your buttons to dispense 60 ml. Extract 2-3 blank shots followed by 2 capsules of a strong variety. This will make a 240-300 ml (8-10 ounce) cup of coffee. A splash of milk or creamer is fine, but don’t add too much.

When I say ""extract 2 capsules"" that means use a second, fresh capsule for the second extraction.

My ex dumped me in November and I felt SO alone. It was a wake up call to create a life outside of romantic relationships so since then I’ve made it my priority to make friends in my city. 
But honestly it’s really getting me down. I’m putting myself out there but everyone is so flakey. I’ve joined Facebook groups designed for lonely girls who are looking to make friends. These girls even post that they are actively looking for meaningful friendships. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve messaged to plan to go for a coffee etc and it never materialises into anything. I’ve been ghosted by so many girls, it’s hurtful and is honestly worse than dating. I even made a WhatsApp group for girls in my city going through breakups. 30 people joined. Ive tried 3 times to arrange meeting up, and all 3 times they either flake last minute or ignore my message in the chat. 
I know people have all sorts going on in their lives and I’m really really trying not to take it personally but honestly the constant rejection, first from my ex and now from trying to make friends, it’s starting to get to me. I’m taking a break from trying to force friendships right now. But has anyone else experienced this and how did you navigate it?

I think I know how but I need a second opinion,"So here's my thoughts, I have been trying to sort my life out. Specifically my sexuality. After 8 years of back and forth on whether I wanted to have Christianity in my life, I discovered ex-vangelical and deconstruction tiktok which has helped heal me. I want God in my life and I have be researching more liberal theology, so to speak. 

I just bought ""Embracing the Journey"" and ""God and the Gay Christian"" and ""Torn"". I haven't finished any but I've planned to read in the order I just listed. The first book honestly is taking so long to read because I can't get through it without crying. 

Back to my idea. I think I could come out to my mom by giving her the book which I have been highlighting and annotating. Along with a letter. My annotation has been done in a way where it's like I'm talking to her. 

My fear is that it may feel impersonal but to be honest, I have no idea how to say it. Its been an interesting process to be honest. **In the next couple paragraphs, I will give a little bit of background if that helps but you can stop here if you just want to answer the question**

So I am really only focusing on coming out to my mom bc she is my best friend and biggestsupporter. However, she's a conservative christain so you know the issue. The real reason it's taken me almost a decade to come is because she hasn't been the most supportive person of gayness. In fact, she made me stop being friends with a bi girl when I was in 5th grade. And when I was in 7th grade, she told me ""Oh lord don't tell me you're gay"" when I told her I've never liked a boy before. Between middle and high school she'd make little comments about me dressing like a lesbian or stuff like that. She also started restricting what I could wear, like blazers and stuff. 

Since college she's been better. She's doesnt really make comments like that anymore and she's been supportive of my clothing. Which, I've become more feminine anyways but she helped me blazer shop not long ago. 

She also doesn't make comments much about disapproving of homosexuality. And she actually is pretty chill with a trans batista at a local coffee shop and respects her pronouns. She also goes out of her way to be friendly with my gay cousin who was emotionally cut off from his parents. He's like 30 years old but still sucks his parents are cold. She also has started becoming more politically centered and against right leaning ideas. Actually, a few months asked me at random if I found guys physically attractive and if that's something I noticed. I told her no. I didn't say I was gay and she didn't ask but I feel like it was an elephant in the room. Suprisingly she just said ""Oh ok cool"". So that's good I guess. Since then there will be random moments where I can feel like the topic is hanging in the air unspoken. Especially with Valentines on the horizon. My campus is hosting a speed dating and she joked that I should go. Then it just fell silent and we got awkward. So I think she knows already but neither of us have made it official. 

Coming out is important to me because she's my best friend. And I want to be on the same page. I don't want to keep dancing around this discussion. Plus, I am still really uncertain of everything I really just want her to have my back. ",2,1739050793.0,GayChristians,1,1.0,False

I previously posted about why dental implants are not recommended and to keep my natural teeth for as long as possible. That's all crystal clear to me now.

Here are some details about my teeth from my old post with some edits: I've had well over a dozen fillings, 3 root canals, and 4 crowns. It was recommended that I keep my natural teeth for as long as possible despite doing around $20k worth of damage already. My teeth got this way due to not seeing the dentist throughout undergrad and overrelying on my parents to still schedule appointments on my behalf. I drank a ton of acidic drinks and energy drinks, which I've abstained from for 5 years and now take caffeine tablets instead (which I'm cutting down now as well). I also have the prescription toothpaste with the highest amount of flouride. I also have a nightguard that I officially need to replace and pick up once it is done next week since I wore it out after 3 years and accidentally bent a part of the left side. The good news is that, even though my self care in the past half year wasn't good, I didn't have any cavities or urgent work needed other than a new nightguard.

I'm posting now because, even though my teeth are coffee stained to the extreme, I have no interest in cosmetic work since no one really notices my teeth and are often surprised about my dental issues when I open up about them to friends. Since implants are off the table (unless implants are on the level of a natural tooth in the next few years), what are options other than the extra fluoride toothpaste, flossing, minimal acidic and carcinogenic food and drinks, etc. that are good preventative options to protect my teeth from further cavities?",1,1739050534.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Lets just crash the fucking system. I know it will super suck major dog dick but we are a country just ran by super rich people. People who get rich off both cheap labor and selling us overpriced shit. How about for just a month. Just do the following.

1. **Dont spend money on extra things!** Cancel the subscriptions to everything. Stop getting that swill they call coffee at starfucks or mcdeenutz. Dont eat out just spend money on your bills related to keeping a roof over your head and the lights on. Nothing more.
2. **Save money on things you do need!** See if anyone has something you need that they are willing to trade for or pay them for. Avoid a store if possible unless its a thrift store for things. Have a day or two where you just cook a big pot of beans and rice or a stew that you can eat for a few days. Dont drive if you dont have to, walk, ride a bike, take a bus, carpool. Turn down your thermostat in your home and throw on some sweaters and a nice blanket. Coupon and only buy things on sale. Basically anything that will help save you money and hurt the company's bottom line. Hell, if you know that your local utility wont do anything to you. Save the money for that bill, and just skip it for a month. Im not saying not pay it but pay it at the last min before stuff gets turned off and massive late fees pile up.
3. **Work just hard enough to not get fired!** I know we all need jobs, so I am not saying quit your job but if your working just hard enough to not get fired, then thats less productivity they make off you. Maybe have a group of your close co-workers, not karen the office snitch, all fake your sick and call out for a couple days if you got PTO or if not, just all act sick at work so they think its just a bug going around and thats why everyone is slow as fuck.

These are the people who would probably draft a 10-paragraph response to a shawarma vs. burger debate but can’t figure out how to stop bot spam clogging the subreddit. They act like they’re overseeing the United Nations of Lebanese discourse, but half the time, it feels like they’re just enforcing random rules so they can feel like someone finally listens to them.

""Post removed: didn’t meet flair guidelines."" Bro, it’s a subreddit, not a constitutional convention. Calm down. And then there’s their obsession with banning any political discussion that gets too spicy—as if Lebanon itself isn’t 90% spice and 10% existential dread. Moderating this subreddit must feel like herding cats, but honestly, it’s more like herding angry, politically radicalized cats.

But hey, someone has to sit there, sipping their third cup of Turkish coffee, power-tripping on the ban button while the rest of us just scroll past another “Is it safe to visit Lebanon?” post. I guess if you can’t fix the country, at least you can micromanage its subreddit, right?

1iky9lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1iky9lq/platonic_meet_and_greet_the_ultimate_screener/,Platonic meet and greet the ultimate screener,"

Due to living outside of the U.S., I took a hiatus from SLF and Seeking, as I realized I didn’t need them—sugaring was much easier where I was located. However, due to work, I have been back in the U.S. more frequently and started using Seeking again. I also started reading SLF again.

Upon returning, I noticed that the platonic, unpaid meet-and-greet (M&G) was almost dead. For me, the platonic, unpaid M&G has always been the ultimate screener. It has also led to some of the best arrangements I have ever had. I do understand that some SBs have concerns about safety, but I don’t fully understand or agree with the reasoning behind avoiding unpaid M&Gs. So, let me spell out how this approach has always worked best for me.

How It Works:

1. Find a profile on Seeking and begin communication. Confirm that she is seeking reasonably the same things I am.


2. Once that’s confirmed, ask to meet for a meal or coffee—preferably lunch. Dinner is an option, but I find that alcohol can lead to misunderstandings.


3. The meeting location should be public and easily accessible for her.


4. Clearly affirm that there is no expectation of intimacy or PDA (especially for SDs who try to cop feels or steal kisses).


5. No exchange of money at the meet-and-greet. This weeds out 90% of gold diggers and rinsers for SDs. For SBs, the no-intimacy rule—while not perfect—helps filter out many undesirables.



The meet-and-greet itself allows both parties to get a feel for each other and determine whether an arrangement could work.

Unfortunately, I can already hear the ""get money"" crowd saying that SBs should be paid for their time. If that’s what you believe, feel free to pursue that. However, keep in mind that most businesses, modeling agencies, and talent agencies don’t pay you to interview at the entry level. At its core, an M&G is an interview, and despite how good you think you are, you’re still entry-level in the arrangement world.

Also, this might sound different, but the faster you both arrange a date, the more likely you’re both serious. That being said, I don’t recommend same-day dates. However, you shouldn’t be talking to a potential match for more than a week without meeting. The idea of ""getting to know someone"" purely through texting is flawed—after all, internet trolls exist, and there are plenty of troll SDs.

Some Don’ts for Platonic M&Gs:

Don’t meet at a hotel bar or restaurant.

Don’t discuss sexual details prior to the meet-and-greet.

Don’t ask for gas money.

I’ve noticed that I’m having better (more supportive, nonjudgmental, uplifting) friendships with “newer” mom friends compared to with some of my friends that I’ve known forever (who are also mothers now). 

I had my son 2 years ago and in these past 2 years I’ve noticed that the friendships with 2 of my past best friends have changed so drastically (one more so than the other) and it’s just kind of caught me off guard. 

Friend #1 (who I at one time considered my closest best friend) not only wasn’t there for me after I had my baby (not even texts to check in even though I was visiting, bringing over coffee, helping with the baby so she could get a shower after she had both of hers before I had mine) but then would say negative comments about my son and me (either about his temperament as a baby or digs about me being a sahm vs being a working mom). Friend #2 checked in on me and visited a few times after I had my baby and I did the same with her after she had hers but she’s also just become very closed off semi recently, although nothing negative like friend #1. Overall I just feel like the 2 friendships have become super judgey since we’ve all become mothers (didn’t feel that way when friend #1 had her babies, 4-6yrs ago, before me/friend #2 had ours within the past 2 years) and our lifestyles just are very different from each other with how we “mother”, working vs staying home (me and friend #2 are both sahms), “villages” we have, how supportive all our husbands our, etc and i feel like it’s caused distance (animosity even ?) in our friendships. Note: when we were teenagers we would literally talk about dreaming of the day when we all had kids and could have them play together, us all “mother” together, and hangout with our husbands/kids doing family stuff but now all of those get togethers have just been full of negative commentary (like how I’ve “wasted my degrees” being a sahm, how my son is “too clingy”, or about his temperament as a baby when he was going through colic/reflux).

However I have “newer” friendships with other moms (all sahms) as well as older friendships with childless friends who I never feel this same judgement around. All (5) of them are super supportive, helpful, and we all vent about things with no judgement towards each other/our babies. It’s great really. I guess I’m just surprised about the friendships with my oldest friends, the ones who I thought our friendships could survive *anything* when now those are my most distant, weakest friendships I have now.

1iky2ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/comments/1iky2ne/full_moon_coffee_shop/,Full Moon Coffee Shop,"I just finished reading Full Moon Coffee Shop by Mai Mochizuki, and I loved it! The book was originally written and published in Japanese. I read the English translation, which is widely available. I got a copy from my local public library.

The book is about **a magical coffee shop run by giant, talking cats.** The coffee shop appears to a series of humans over the course of the book. All of the people in the story are connected to each other in some way, though they're not always aware of these connections. Each person has something they are struggling with, or something that is holding them back in life. 

There is no menu at the coffee shop. Instead, the cats bring each guest a special dessert, or a beverage. The cats also helpfully do each person's horoscope and tell them what adjustments or changes they may need to make in their life in order to bring more balance, temper a particular character flaw, or take steps to solve their problems.

The desserts and drinks are wonderful, celestial-themed treats. There is a black and white illustration of each dessert in the book. Some examples are: pancakes with celestial syrup, mercury cream soda, and moonlight-and-Venus champagne float.

As the book goes on, you gain a deeper sense of how the humans are all connected to one another and you get to see them implement some of the cats' astrology advice.

I found the book to be absolutely charming, sweet, cozy, and heartwarming. Some of the reviews on Goodreads complained that the story is not realistic. Well, no. It's about a magic coffee shop run by huge cats! The prose was maybe a bit... spare, perhaps? I didn't mind this at all, however. I thought the book had such an airy and gentle quality.

There's an author's note at the end of the book that said the book was inspired by a series of illustrations by Chihiro Sakurada. They're gorgeous! You can view some of the illustrations here: https://grapeejapan.com/119199

If you like the vibe of the illustrations, or if you enjoy books in translation, desserts and little drinkity drinks, astrology, cats, and ""no plot, just vibes"" stories, I think you would enjoy this book!

It's such bs.  I'm sure everyone on these forums is already familiar and mad too but, I found this one particularly egregious

Discounts at local merchants are not an amenity!  RUFKM.

So there are exactly 2 things of any actual value in this list - Capital Bikeshare day pass, and Nespresso maker.

Well, both days, I asked for a Nespresso maker - first day the guy told me that he had no idea what I am talking about, and that the basic cheap disgusting Hamilton Beach drip coffee maker in my room - with a generic packet of the world's worst coffee - was indeed the Espresso maker.

Second day, a woman tells me ""I think all the machines are out.""

I am pretty sure the hotel doesn't have any Nespresso machines at all.  It seems like a big fat lie.

Then I asked for a bike share code - ""oh, we haven't gotten those for February yet.""

Um that is not an acceptable answer.

I was actually using a free night so I was exempt from the ridiculous $30 fee but I would have raised much more of a ruckus if they were trying to charge me, and it sure as hell solidifies my commitment to never stay there again and to tell as many people as possible that they are scamming people with this BS list of non-existent amenities.  It's so slimy and disgusting.

Also, DC Navy Yard is hardly a ""destination"".  It's out in the middle of nowhere.  It's a brand new up and coming neighborhood but for pretty much any typical visitor to DC, this is so far out of the center of town you will be commuting a lot and wondering why on earth this property thinks it deserves to charge a ""destination fee"".

Oh and one last item for shits and giggles, their internet was slow as hell. And there was no welcome beverage.  And there was no music. I guess I should have made some ""long distance calls"".  Oh wait it's 2025 and nobody has used a hotel landline for domestic phone calls in 15 years.

We have been exclusively contact napping during the day, as when we'd try to transfer her to the bassinet she'd wake up almost immediately. She also fights naps terribly. Lots of screaming for the first few minutes of rocking her. 

On a whim last week, just before she was due for a nap I laid her in her bassinet awake and rocked it a bit. And within a few minutes she FELL ASLEEP! With only a bit of fussing! Since then, we have done almost every nap in the bassinet and she's done so well with it.

So I am new to this sub and while I have not studied psychology myself, I developed an interest in it based on my own experiences at university. I am a blind person but I still managed to go to university. I have an undergraduate and a masters degree. This might be of interest to anyone else on here who might have gone through similar experiences. 

To cut a long story short, my experience at university was not the best, to put it mildly. I am not from the US but I have been a good few times with my family. 

There was little or no support at my university for people who were blind, and also people with other disabilities too. There was no braille on most of the elevators, and many of the campus buildings themselves were like obstacle courses, to such an extent that even with the best mobility training it would have been nearly impossible to get around without major assistance. 
I observed that the student culture was quite toxic and not very inclusive. I did get involved in clubs and societies and frequently stayed behind after lectures too. I made a lot of observations during that time. 

It seemed to me that a lot of college students were insecure, not just first years but even second years, third years and 4th years. Peer pressure was vrampont  and a lot of students lack confidence in themselves. 

A lot of the events that were set up for students were mostly centered around binge drinking and excessive alcohol consumption. I was much more into going to coffee shops, restaurants and hanging out in more chill environments. It was really concerning how normalised and accepted it was to get black out drunk many times a week. For many of my classmates, it was 3 times a week. I did ask many times if they would be interested to do other activities but to no avail. 

A lot of them were insecure as well about having a blind student in their course and many were reluctant to hang out outside of lectures and tutorials. 

By the time I graduated with my undergrad, many of my classmates had either dropped out of the course or were alcoholics at this point. I remember at one point during my undergrad one of the students who was suppose to take me to class was so hungover that he couldn’t come and take me to class and we had to get someone else to take me. 

I know the university environment can be very difficult for a lot of people. I guess I came here because I’m looking for more chill people who are interested to chat in coffee shops, restaurants and similar places. I have also traveled a lot with my parents too. 

If you have experienced similar things I would also be very happy to chat. I think it’s important that people hear more of these stories to get a better understanding of what university life can really be like for many students. ",2,1739048438.0,psychologystudents,2,1.0,False

I’ve noticed customers using tables for extended periods without purchasing anything, which negatively impacts the experience for paying customers. As someone who spent $3,100 at Starbucks in 2024, I expect a higher standard of service and consistency from the brand.

Most concerning is the poor customer service, both online and over the phone. I recently placed a mobile order, as I was in a rush, but when I picked it up, the order was incorrect. The barista informed me that correcting it would take 5-10 minutes, and since I didn’t have time to wait, I was advised to contact customer service. I followed up with an email, requesting either a refund, stars, or a voucher for a free drink, but the response was frustrating: I was told to take advantage of the Starbucks Promise and get my order remade. This misses the point—why would I wait for a remake when I specifically used the mobile order feature to save time?

I then called customer service, and the agent suggested I return to the store in Salt Lake City, when I was already home in Miami, to resolve the issue. This response was not only impractical but also insulting. Who's going to spend $600 on a round trip ticket to Utah for a $9 Starbucks order? Starbucks needs a better system in place for addressing issues related to mobile orders, or it should reconsider offering the feature altogether if it can't provide an efficient way to handle mistakes.

As a result of these repeated frustrations, Starbucks has gradually been phased out of my morning routine. I’ve been making coffee at home more often or turning to other coffee shops when I’m on the go. While I will continue to make occasional purchases, my spending has dropped to under $30 per month. Once my remaining 2,700 stars are used, I will likely no longer be a loyal customer.",0,1739048348.0,starbucks,6,0.25,False

-she is “honored” (says this multiple times) to be the person who is the recipient of these negative feelings. “essentially a punching bag” is how she phrases it. she says she is happy to take this if it means snarkers are nicer to people in real life because of it. 
“i’ll still take it if it helps them”. “in some way, it’s an honor to be disliked”

-she used to care about winning everyone over but is ok with just being a distraction. 
quote “i know life can be really cruel and hard[…]thats heavy and a lot to carry”. 

-they wonder what it would be like to have coffee with the people on this reddit, maybe she would be friends.

-jordy says that he laughs w us and is kinda like “yeah you got me”. specifically mentions the ‘jordy dahmer’ jokes.

Ever been caught in that tricky spot where you can not decide between two exciting options? But maybe awe can brainstorm and figure out which one truly tickles our fancy. Maybe we will end up choosing both- because experimenting is half the fun, right? Now, if you're up for such whimsical chats that can glide from light-hearted banter to profound musings, maybe you should write to me. I have indulged in penpal-ing since high school, and absolutely love that. However, it has been difficult now to squeeze in enough time to do snail mailing, but making friends over written words has still been equally charming to me. 

  
Some random tidbits about me -  
\- After finishing uni past year, I work as a scientist building some artificial intelligence thingamajigs in biotech (for more technically interested ones - we do machine learning) in London. And no, we do not wear lab coats (most of the times). I am absolutely smitten with what I do and where I am. To be fair, I love science in any form.

  
\- One of my claim-to-fame moments till now has been being at loo next to a Nobel laureate.

  
\- I love to read. Aside from taking part in bookclubs, on some weekends, I sneak away to different cafés, libraries, parks, river banks, and other places in my city to read alone. A dream of mine is to have a big personal library at some point! 

  
\- I am into running, hiking, rambling, biking, and squash. In addition, I am always keen on checking out new sports! Also I really enjoy exploring outdoors, generally with friends.

  
\- I enjoy cooking, even though I am very slow at it and I am fairly certain that I am not very good at it either. Bonus happiness though if I am doing it with friends.

  
\- I am very close to my family. And I am the silliest (and definitely the cheekiest) one among them.

  
\- Regarding music, I listen to a bit of everything, depending on my mood. Having said that, more often I find myself listening to classical and indie. Some of my favourite classical composers include Brahms, Vivaldi, and Dvořák. My city has an incredible music scene, so I sometime find it tough to stop myself from going to too many concerts!

  
\- I have seen some posts including their MBTI or enneagram type. So if you are interested in that - from all the times I have given the MBTI test, I have been an ENTJ. Similarly for the enneagram tests I have been a number 3. Though I believe it is difficult to profile someone based on just one type alone (also without enough statistics).

  
\- Here are some more random clichéd things I like. I love going to a wide variety of museums (from art to natural history and more) and spending hours getting lost inside. My personal record till now has been visiting four museums on the same day (Was it stupid? Yes. Do I regret it? Eh, not at all.). With friends, I like exploring independent cafés and sampling hot chocolates. If you are looking for a recommendation, I suggest The Wren Coffee in London for weekdays!

  
If you have read until this long, thank you for that! I did not want to cut things short. Maybe we have got some shared interests, or perhaps we are total opposites- exciting either way, right? Whether we are kindred spirits or from different galaxies, I am waiting for your message and getting excited to brainstorm the fun experiments in choosing either of those two options ahead.

  
Good day to you and cheerio!",1,1739047856.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

After seven weeks, they found granulated tissue and had to do another surgery to remove (they also then found that there had been a “cave” in the wound.) 

I am now five days past my surgery and have not been able to poop. I still have gas, but the poop will not come in any meaningful way. I have an urgent need to go to the bathroom about every 1-3 hours (even at night), but then I sit there and nothing happens. It’s a nightmare. I have tried prunes, stool softener, coffee, fruits and veg, walking. 

Please, is this normal? Anyone have similar experience with a 3rd or 4th degree tear and surgery? ",2,1739047829.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

I’m hoping to check out some cool cultural spots and experiences that dive deep into Japanese traditions, as well as modern tech innovations.

If anyone has recommendations for places to visit, I’d love to hear them! Whether it’s historical sites, art museums, or even places that showcase Tokyo’s tech and innovation, I’m down to explore.

Also, I thought it would be fun to meet some fellow Americans who are also in Tokyo! If you’re up for grabbing lunch or coffee, let me know – would love to chat and swap travel tips.

I have a 6 year old gaming laptop with a gtx2060/icore7 etc. game plays fine on medium settings. But loading a saved game from overnight takes like 4-5 minutes. 

Would a new PC change this much or should I just factor this in and expect to make a coffee?

I actually had to take a break for a week because after all the research, reading all the history, and learning about cryptograms/ciphers my brain felt like mush...I woke up one morning and tried to do simple math and it took me an hour and a half to wake up all the way even after I drank a whole coffee with cream and granulated sugar, it still took a while! When I did finally become coherent enough to recheck my mathmatics I found that it was wrong... No big deal.. after I ended up recalculating everything and I was left with more money left over than I thought I was going to have, luckily. Last night I found myself reading and my eyes fely strained to the point where I was unable to continue on with my investigation. Tonight I think I'm going to drink and look up NSA government code words in relation to each letter of the alphabet. Maybe the adult beverages will act as anti-inflammatory so I can be at least be comfortable while I'm confused lol. Either way after being sick for the last week and a half I think I definitely deserve some r&r.

For people who split expenses in a flexible way, how do you make sure it stays fair without making it feel like you’re tracking every dollar?

* Just let it ride and assume it evens out?
* Open a shared account for joint expenses?

Me (26M) and my gf (25F) been together 3 years, and we never really kept tabs on who pays for what. I usually get the big stuff—dinners, trips, rent, all that—while she gets smaller things like coffee, groceries, lil everyday things.

Never really been an issue, and I don’t wanna make money feel transactional, but lately, I've been noticing I cover a lot more of the heavy costs. I know she's not really doin it on purpose, and I know she brings other things to the relationship, but I’d be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it.

At the same time, I don’t wanna sit her down like “yo, let’s settle expenses babe?” ‘cause that feels weird as hell. But I also don’t wanna ignore it til it starts bothering me for real.

How do I bring this up without making it a whole thing or making it feel like I’m tryna be too transactional with her, or keeping score or something?

The strongest projects do not rely on artificial hype or temporary catalysts. Instead, they thrive on deep community engagement, organic growth, and a compelling narrative that goes beyond price speculation.

Kendu Inu is a perfect example of this thesis in action. It is more than just a token; it is a brand with an expanding ecosystem that includes energy drinks, coffee, jewelry, laser-etched dog tags, and Kendu Entertainment. Unlike projects that chase centralized exchange listings and short-term pumps, Kendu Inu focuses on a long-term, community-driven roadmap.

This is not a project where people wait for direction from the top. It is a movement built on action, where holders take initiative and turn ideas into reality. Kendu Inu does not rely on paid marketing or influencer campaigns. Instead, it grows organically through the dedication of its community.

The project has also expanded beyond Ethereum by bridging to Solana and more recently to Base. This cross-chain presence strengthens its ecosystem and ensures its adaptability in an evolving market. Even as Kendu Inu grows, it has not lost sight of its origins. The community has returned to the original Telegram group, reigniting the energy that first made Kendu special.

At a market cap below 15 million, Kendu Inu presents a unique opportunity. The project has already built a strong foundation with an active and loyal community. As more people recognize its long-term vision, the upside potential is massive. Kendu Inu is not just another memecoin. It is a movement with the fundamentals and the community strength to reach new heights.

1ikwu8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ikwu8c/solo_trip_to_vietnam/,Solo Trip to Vietnam,"Hi all, I’m planning my first ever solo trip and have decided to go to Vietnam for about 14 days, maybe Thailand for a couple days depending on how much time I can get off work. I have been watching plenty of YouTube videos on people’s travels and have gathered my itinerary from those said videos. I am open to changing things around if I get some good suggestions or advice on other things to do/places to go. I am also wondering the best sites to get a visa(also wondering if I need one if I’ll be there under 30 days). I am a bit confused as to what vaccinations I’d need to enter the country and how early or late I can get them before my trip. I have read it is a risk walking around using your phone and camera in busy city areas so wondered if this is true or if you just need common sense and not just holding without paying attention, mainly worried cuz I’d need my phone to navigate places and clam a photographer so would want to take photos of absolutely everything. I have so many more questions but this post already seems too long lol.

This is going to be a long post. I apologize for about formatting. I’ve dealt with gut issues for the past four years. I’ve been diagnosed with sibo and I have intestinal colitis. my problem is anything that I consume other than beef aggravates my stomach and I produce horrible gas that I have no control over and is always leaking out of me. I have no ability to hold this gas in. It gets so bad and prevent me from interacting with my friends as I would like to. i’ve been on antibiotics multiple times and I’ve done tests to check that. I didn’t completely nuke my micro biome. I used to be a smoker and this problem was always aggravated whenever I would smoke. I took a break for a while and I was fine, but I still had to ensure that I was strictly eating beef and salt, only otherwise this problem was persistent. I used to think that my use of drugs (nicotine, weed) was the problem and that I just had to quit those and I would be fine, but I can’t eat carbs whatsoever. Any form of carbs would destroy my stomach and this problem would be back. I can’t drink coffee. I’m just struggling to live normal life, I experienced symptom relief when I am eating strictly beef, but I can’t maintain this life style to doctors over these few years and they always put me on new antibiotics that I feel like just resetting me back to square one I’ve experiment probiotics, but I feel like that. Also makes the problem much worse. I understand that probiotics need to be maintained for a while to gain the positive results and I can’t expect immediate results, but it is just so disheartening to experience such a horrible gas that leaves me housebound due to embarrassment uncontrollable gas. i’m reaching out to gain insight on what possible reason could be for this issue that I’m dealing with and what possible measures I could take or avenues I could explore in hopes of curing this problem.",5,1739046424.0,Microbiome,1,1.0,False

For those who haven't been, the portion is substantial. I was surprised, even after folks telling me on here that they're generous. This goes for the toppings I asked for as well, all of it was perfectly proportional. 

I wasn't that hungry when I went. I just wanted to try out of curiosity. But I devoured that plate.

All in all, with a cup of coffee, the breakfast cost me $12. Not bad at all.

As sit at my office I still ponder who I saw in the mirror, I ask everyone if I look different, they say I have done something different with my hair, anger swells my brain as all I can think is ""Who did I see in the mirror?""

I look through my phone and see memories from days long gone, it's me, that's me, that's my face, why don't I look like that? I ask a friend ""Why don't I look like him anymore?"" confused, they walk away and leave me with my thoughts. 

I go home, broken from this day of wondering, as I look through my memories, I see it, why I'm different

The love in my eyes is gone
My soul is gone
I'm me, but I only look like me, I'm the person in the memories, but not the same

What happened? Years of heartbreak, abuse, mental health issues and being thrown under the bus? I'm me surely, but I look into the mirror and I don't see myself anymore, why did I lose myself? Why can't I recognise myself? 

Sadness turns into anger, anger breaks the mirror and shows me what I've not been seeing, I see my face into hundreds of bits, each one different to the last, each one tells me a story, a story of love and loss, a story of trial and error, a story of a world that made me into me, and I didn't hold onto myself enough, I wasn't strong enough. Who am I? Why did this happened?

1ikwlhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ikwlhf/aitah_for_not_making_my_boyfriend_coffee/,AITAH For Not Making My Boyfriend Coffee,"Hi Reddit. I want to start by saying that I don't think I'm the asshole. I think this is a common miscommunication. That said, I live a fairly quiet life. I'm not in a lot of opportunities to be ""the asshole,"" so I figured I'd ask for Reddit's take.

Some backstory: I am not a kept woman. My boyfriend and I love each other very much, and one of my love languages is acts of service. When I drink coffee, I make it black, as I don't really have much of a taste for sweet things. My boyfriend, on the other hand, likes his coffee with milk and sugar. When we started dating, I asked how he made his coffee and started making it for him. I enjoy doing it. Now, when he wants coffee or we have something planned for the morning, he will ask me to make his coffee for him. I always do. Not because I have to. Not because he expects me to. But because I enjoy expressing my love through making him a coffee, and he feels loved when he has a coffee, just the way he likes it, that wasn't made by him because his girlfriend made it a point to learn how he makes his. Just wanted to get that out of the way because this is Reddit, and I don't want people thinking I'm some coffee slave. 

Now, to the real story. About a month ago, my boyfriend (M31) asked me (F27) if I wanted to move in together, when his lease was up. I was overjoyed and said yes. I basically already live at his place anyway. And like I said before, we love each other a lot. 

So, for about a month, we've been looking at rentals that we can afford and both like. Recently, we found a really nice place and decided to request a tour. It was scheduled for noon today. We both intended to go.

Last night, however, we stayed up way too late. We had company and were having fun. So, at the time, we were like eeeeh fuck it. We'll just be tired when we go see the house. Last night, he also asked me to make him a coffee in the morning. I said yes. 

Fast forward, it is now 10am and my alarm is going off. I hit snooze. I end up snoozing my alarm probably 5 times. When I see the time, I know I have to make a decision. Either contact the couple renting the house and ask to reschedule (which would be unprofessional and could hurt our chances of getting the house) or drag myself out of bed and go see the house.

I roll over, and I ask my boyfriend if I should ask to reschedule. He doesn't answer my question, and instead replied that he didn't sleep well. I opened my phone and saw I had a message from the couple asking to confirm if we were coming. I told my boyfriend that I was just going to force myself to go see the house, assuming he no longer wanted to go. 

I got up, threw on some jeans, combed my hair, brushed my teeth; and within like 10-15 minutes, I was ready to leave. 

I went back to the bedroom to say goodbye to my boyfriend. Something like, ""Okay, I'm leaving to go see the house."" He then responded with, ""Without me?""

I was confused. I thought he didn't want to go. So I asked if he wanted to go to which he replied with something like, ""I thought you were going to bring me coffee. I'm not ready to go. If I get ready now, we'll be late."" I told him that I intended to make him coffee before we slept in. He told me he didn't know we slept in. I told him that I assumed he knew because I snoozed my alarm so many times. (My alarm is not quiet. And he reacted each time by rolling away from my phone.) 

I think he thought I must've set my alarm for much earlier than I did, so the snoozing was fine. I thought we both knew we were sleeping in, because of the snoozing. When I asked if we should reschedule and he just said he was still tired, I thought he was saying he didn't want to go. 

I genuinely think it was a sleepy miscommunication, but since I've been back from seeing the house, he hasn't left the bedroom. The longer he stays in there, the more I think I might have fucked up. 

I did tell him I would make him a coffee in the morning. I could understand why he didn't get up because he was half asleep and thought he could keep sleeping until coffee time. That said, I thought it was understood that we were oversleeping. I even asked if we should reschedule. He told me he slept poorly and went back to bed. I think it's also fair that I misunderstood that he wanted to lay there for as long as he could as him not wanting to go. 

So, Reddit. Am I the asshole for not making my boyfriend coffee? ",1,1739045974.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False
1ikwksz,https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/1ikwksz/looking_into_long_lenses_for_completing_my_analog/,"Looking into Long Lenses for completing my ""Analog"" System","Recently my parents gave me a bunch of old Canon EF Gear after I moved from Digital back to Film Photography. I began building up a more substantial kit opting to get a EOS-1N with the High speed drive (will be getting the normal battery grip as well) and the Canon 24-70 F2.8 L USM have been loving the results so far. I got the system primarily to serve as my AF film camera again also knowing I can adapt the lenses to either the latest mirrorless bodies or get a used DSLR body if I wanted to jump back to digital again.   
  
Now to my primary question, I'm stuck looking for some next lenses for this system. Specifically in the Telephoto range, again with the expectation I'll probably be using them on some sort of digital body in the future as well (I mention this for a reason which I'll touch on below).   
  
I shoot primarily Automotive photography but dabble with Street and I want to also eventually do something with shooting models/portraits while incorporating the previously other mentioned situations as well. Automotive shooting is generally at cars and coffee but I do make it out to at least 1 race a year where either a long lens or high megapixel/crop-able image is beneficial. For most of my automotive shooting style I'm usually shooting wide open to near wide open unless I'm trying to compose something with the background (ie need them fast boi lenses). 

As of right now this is the full list I'm considering at getting, and I would want at least one Macro lens (so I can eventually move to digitally scanning my negatives) and one telephoto (either zoom or prime): 

Macro Options:   
50mm F2.5  
100mm F2.8   
100mm F2.8 L

Telephoto Options:  
85mm F1.2L  
135mm F2 L  
200mm F2 L IS    
300mm F2.8 L IS  
70-200mm F2.8 L IS

Additionally I should also mention for the telephoto non-macro options, I'm also looking at the first version of all the lenses rather than the version ii or iii (if applicable). I've found I prefer having lenses and images not be perfect out of camera as I just find it a pain to edit imperfections back in post. Additionally I would likely opt to eventually get a tele converter for this range as well.   
Further if there is any 3rd party glass from Sigma or Tamron that can compete with the Canon L glass feel free to suggest that as well. Big fan of Sigma thanks to using them back when I was in Sony APS-C land so if any lenses fit the bill I'll dig into them. 

If I think of anything else I will add an edit in the post and I'll try to respond comment questions as I see them come in. Thank you for all the guidance and suggestions ahead of time. ",1,1739045923.0,canon,4,1.0,False

I am trying to keep a positive attitude but feeling so defeated. I've been having burning stomach, bloating, belching, abdominal pain, feeling like food is just stuck in my gut, and so on for about 7 weeks now. I'm eating bland foods, and taking 20mg omeprazole (caused abdominal pain so I switched to 20mg esomaprazole). Doc gave me sucralfate so I'll try that at night now. 

Last year I went to see a GI about nausea at night and burning stomach, and she did a H.Pylori breath test + gluten allergy test. Both negative. But I was still living pretty normally and managing with H2 blockers, nothing like this constant debilitating pain now. I've had two flare ups of LPR in the last 7 years at times of particular stress, both of which resolved with PPI's in a few months time. I went to see a GI again last month, they did an abdominal ultrasound and found nothing, and I'm going to have an endoscopy next week.

I don't drink, smoke, no coffee, no black tea, already was avoiding spicy and acidic food for years now. I'm 27yo female, very active, and slim. 

When I got LPR for the first time, I remember going through all the forums and seeing people who had been suffering for years and freaking out. But in the end, I was able to heal in a fairly standard timeline. *I keep telling myself this will be like that and I'll turn a corner soon, but every good day is followed by another day as bad as the beginning.* I woke up today and ate a plain boiled potato. Immediately my stomach started burning.

For example on a Monday morning it's the same fcking conversation 'how was your weekend? What did you do?' It sounds harsh but like I don't give a fuck what they did on the weekend with their 10 kids. Every time I bring my food into the office to eat (no where else to really go) I get the 'ooo something smells good what have you got' and 'oh did you really just eat a whole pack of biscuits' like yes I fxking did so piss off.

Reminds me everyday of the things I need to do when I know how to do my job... they make comments on me smoking, having sugar In my tea. 

Back in July I went through something really bad resulting in me needing time off. Ever since I moved into another place iv just lost all motivation.  Knowing Iv got to be there every single day feels like torture. I get treated unfairly too as in others can work from home and they have an issue with me doing it even though I was sick and still willing to work.

Monday mornings I haven't even had a coffee yet and they wanna chew my ear off and ask the bullshit what did u do at your weekend.

I even got asked why i was taking my bag to the toilet.... it was to make a hot water bottle for cramps but I also do that containing female products which im like why the f do you even care. I'm just so stressed out, I'm now on antidepressants because its making me so chronically depressed. I have major anxiety just thinking about going to work because of feeling so trapped. I feel like I'm suffocating. I'm at the same desk, same wall, same writing and posters.  Same chair.  Same people same four walls. 

I do listen to music in the day and podcasts to get me through thank god they don't have an issue with me having earphones in but iv just had enough. 

I'm also starting an online business to basically attempt to escape. But it does feel like jail time where I have to devise an escape plan.

I have an amazing job offer in the city I want with good hours and benefits. The offer expires today and I completed final interviews at other places but they haven’t gotten back to me yet. I visited the office of the place that gave me an offer and it felt really…right? And I got along so well with the team over coffee. But I know the heart is decietful above all things and God has been convicting me of pride and impatience lately which is why I was waiting on Him to give me an answer on whether to accept this offer or not.

The offer expires today and I’m super nervous. I want to accept but I’ve made the mistake of moving ahead of God before and don’t want to repeat it. What do you do when you’re facing a big decision and don’t hear from the LORD? ",3,1739045876.0,TrueChristian,3,1.0,False

The coffee it makes is fine, but not great. I've tried many different kinds of pods over the years, but honestly nothing's made a real difference. I'm wondering if it's because of the trade-off you make with the convenience of Nespresso, or if it's my machine. 

Generally, would buying a more expensive OL machine make any difference in terms of the espresso they make? Or are they all basically the same?",4,1739045852.0,nespresso,4,0.83,False

1ikwgtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Imaginary-Bison9618/comments/1ikwgtk/how_to_destroy_a_superpower_without_a_single/,How to destroy a superpower without a single bullet or bomb.,"I'm reading my morning newspaper with my coffee and donut this morning. Reminiscing on American and world history decades ago in a classroom as I bubble the answers on a scantron for the final wondering why the hell does this shit matter only now to realize why learning history is important.

We are under attack. I think about how to destroy America if I was another superpower that couldn't outgun or win in traditional warfare. American democracy is we the people for the people. If I could somehow control their people I can control their government. Social media has arisen and is the perfect tool to propagandized and radicalize people to my will. It's worked to radicalized ordinary people into terrorists I'm sure I can use it to deepen the gap between their political parties. Enable a person of influence but easy to manipulate, someone with a fragile ego and feed my propaganda machine to get him elected. 

Then:
Radicalized enough citizens of the population to keep him in power.

Turn America's allies against them. And their people against each other.

Gaslight betrayed countries to realize their once trusted ally was using/ abusing them. 

Make betrayed allies my allies and establish a new alliance if not keep them fractured.

Distract the American citizens of my true intent by flooding their media with trivial topics ie dismantling of departments of government, gender identity, rights, abortion. 

Crush their economy. Maintain inflation, rise the price of goods and destroy their established trade agreements, tax cuts and dismantle their IRS. The machine that funds their army.

Destroy their educated population to prevent revolt but not by physical means but to outnumber them by the idiot. Erase their history to insure they remain docile.

At their weakest state. I will take over as the global super power and reign my influence over the world.

Let's make America great again. When America didn't exist.


Reviewing history great empires and nations usually crumble from within than from external forces.

Feel free to add.


I'm going to finish my morning news paper.

People stop looking down on your phone screen and look up around you.
