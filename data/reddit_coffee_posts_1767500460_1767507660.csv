Hey everyone,

Relocated from Mumbai and I’m still navigating the rhythm of the city. I’m a 32-year-old guy, fully independent, and looking to build some genuine connections here intwin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.

I’m at a stage where I value quality over quantity. Whether you’re looking for a solid friendship, a partner in crime for exploring, or something with a ""benefits"" element (FWB), I’m open to seeing where things go if the chemistry is right.

A bit about me:
The Vibe: Chill, easy-going, and drama-free.
Interests: Big on movies (theaters or home), long drives, exploring the local food scene, traveling, and catching live shows/events.

Host Status: I live independently and can host occasionally for the right person/deserving vibes.

Nights in: Huge fan of the classic Netflix & Chill—sometimes a quiet night in with good food and a movie is better than a night out.

What I’m looking for:
Someone who is authentic, independent, and down to actually do things rather than just text forever. If you’re up for a drive, a dinner date, or just hanging out at my place to unwind, let's talk.

If this resonates with you, slide into my DMs with a bit about yourself and what you’re looking for.

1q3ihte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Craps/comments/1q3ihte/vegas_trip_report_12261229/,Vegas trip report 12/26-12/29,"My Brother and I decided when the NFL schedule came out that we would go watch our POS NY Giants in las vegas when they went to go play there. 

""We'll probably be watching a game with heavy draft implications"" is what I texted him after we locked in the plans and lo and behold...

Anyway- Id been dinking dunking and stashing away winnings over the course of a month to have as a bankroll roll for the trip since my brother never played craps so I fully intended to show hime the beauty of this wonderful game. With a bankroll just north of 6k I was ready to fucking touch some dice. 

We both arrived around 11pm and i immediately won 600 at the bubble craps station in the airport terminal. ""This is either a great sign or I just blew my load way too early"". 

He gets off his flight and to my despair he tells me hes come down with a cold and will be calling it an early night so he can get after it with me all day saturday. 

I sadly agree its for the best and let him head up to his comped room (my comp) at the cosmo while i head to my own. I try to force myself to sleep but the visions of box cars and parlayed hard 8s dance around in my head too much. 

I grab my dice throwing shirt, shoes and pants and head straight down to the best crew on the strip, the cosmo craps pit. 

First shooter sets their point 50 pass, 270 out please, 50 for the bonus+ 3 way, thank you lets go shoote- 6-1. 

Ok no worries lets get the cubes warm lucky number 5's the point lets do the 270 across again , 59 bonuses and three way lets go shooter cmon sh- 6-1. 

I think you know where this is going. 

After getting my face ripped off at the table i decide to try the bubble. Down another 800 there. 

I go to the bar for a drink and realize I just tanked half my bankroll in less than 30 minutes. 

I go upstairs. Angrily order room service. Angrily binge the room service, forxe myself to bed, and dream of those beautiful box numbers coming in all night. 

The next day the cosmo buffet had snow crab legs at the brunch buffet.  I had about 8 crabs worth of them and a spinach salad and black coffee.  

My brother and I decide to go back down to the cosmo casino so i can show him how to play. I find some relatively lucky shooters and am up 800 pretty quickly. He immediately understands the beauty of the game but has yet to witness the horror. 

We play some blackjack that sees me lose another 600 before deciding to head to fremont to check out the cheap casinos and their retard strength beverages. 

First stop is el cortez- the knicks were playing so we parked our asses at the bar extending into the high limit slots area and played virtual bj to keep the free drinks coming while we watched the knicks. 

Lady luck started filming a youtube video near us and I was embarassed to know who she was so before i did or said anything cringeworthy i suggested we check out their crapless table because i wanted to play the hardway all day bonus. 

My brother goes off to get another drink while i sit at the infamous elco craps table that ive seen hundreds of hours worth in bluffs videos. 

Same as last night at the cosmo- 270 across. 50 pass, 50 for the bonus (10-15-10) but instead of 15 on the three way i put 15 on the hardways all day. 

Shooters rolling pretty well, peppering the inside box numbers. He hots his point twice and im up a good amount. He rolls a hard 10 and i think to myself, ""hold on hes rolled a few hardways already...""

Hes rolled three of four, only needs a hard 6 to win it. Holy fuck when did this happen

Holy fuck it pays 156-1??

Holy fuck i have 15 on it??

Holy fuck he just hit his point again?!

The puck goes off, my brother cones over and sees im up huge already. 

I whisper to him, well out of sight and earshot of the shooter, ""if this dude roles a hard 6, I win 2400 fuckin dollars"". 

""You know what to do now"" the shooters friend calmly tells him. The shooter sets his dice and doesnt hesitate to roll them. 

THREE. THREE. 

LETS FUCKIN GO SHOOTER. LETS FUCKIN GO. HOLY FUCK. 2400 LETS FUCKIN GO. GOD DAMN. 

The entire area by the craps put quiets down and I have way more eyeballs on me than i expected 

""Sorry...sorry, im just excited sorry"". The pit boss and dealers laugh and say not to apologize theyre happy too. 

I tip the shooter 100 for no good reason, he had 25 on it too, and tipped the dealers 100 as well. In hindsight im a bit too generous with gambling winni gs but it is what it is. 

We walk away from elco up 3k and practically back to my original bankroll. 

Then we made the mistake to walk fremont. 

First up was circa- where its not called craps, its called ""Dice"". 10 minimum but i justt scored big so might as well do my 270- PSO. 

OK lets try again at this long ass deep assmorbidly obese bathrub looking ass table- PSO. see ya!

Then to binions, where I waxed poetic to my brother about how this is where the real gambling happens, where people scape together dollars to try their luck and make it something grand. 

They have a half tub! Awesome! Lets try it! 4 more PSO's! Not awesome!!

And just like that, im down another 2k. 

We get back to the cosmo and my brother is beat so he heads to bed. 

The stadium craps is open and i havent quite quenched my thirst of the bones yet. Its just me and the dealer so i go toe to tow with the backwall. 

I do practically every strategy you can think of in crapless. Come bet strat, iron cross, 440 reduce, you name it I try it. I just cant make a profit. Back to my room, taile between legs, angry room service, angry sleep. 

The next day the giants wont the football game. 

On the walk back to the cosmo we did what any good northeastern tourist to vegas does and we hopped more casinos. 

I went on a demi-god roll at the mgm grand but was so drunk that on the walk to the bar i lost one of my 500 buck chips. I went back to the same craps table and demanded they help me won it back lol. I went on a decent roll with mostly points hit and won another 600 to cover my stupidity. 

Losing the chip spooked me so we beelined it back to the cosmo where again we called it a night as we had shitty morning flights the next day. 

All in all, it was a rope a dope kind of trip with no serious breakthroughs besides the Hardways all day bonus hit.

Trying to find the name of a queer novel I saw in a bookshop about a year ago — I’m assuming it’s been published recently, but not a guarantee. I believe the author may have been a woman or at least had a feminine name, but not sure.

From what I remember of the blurb, the story is about a bisexual woman who has only dated men in her life and has recently broken up with one (or is still in a relationship with one?). She’s basically struggling with her sexuality, heteronormativity, and feeling conflicted about not having relationships with women. I think the protagonist is in her 20s, so a bit of a young adult vibe — at the very least, exploring those common YA themes of identity, uncertainty and relationships.

I remember that the artwork for this book was a bit of a collage, including possibly the main character drinking coffee in her apartment; images of friends. I believe the title was in white cursive.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1q3ifkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProsePorn/comments/1q3ifkv/speedboat_by_renata_adler/,Speedboat by Renata Adler,"Talent was blazing through the columns and onto the coffee tables. The physical-assault metaphor had taken over the reviews. ""Guts,"" never much of a word outside the hunting season, was a favorite noun in literary prose. People were said to have or to lack them, to perceive beauty and make moral distinctions in no other place. ""Gut-busting"" and ""gut-wrenching"" were accolades. ""Nerve-shattering ""eye-popping,"" ""bone-crunching""— the responsive critic was a crushed, impaled, electrocuted man. ""Searing"" was lukewarm. Anything merely spraining or tooth-extracting would have been only a minor masterpiece. ""Literally,"" in every single case, meant figuratively; that is, not literally. This film will literally grab you by the throat. This book will literally knock you out of your chair. ""Presently"" always meant not soon but now.  
  
Sometimes the assault mode took the form of peremptory orders. See it. Read it. Go at once. Sometimes it sidled up disguised as musing, in unanswerable-question form. Shall I tell you how much I...Should I even attempt to describe...Or, should I say unequivocally...A favorite strategy was the paragraph-terminating: Right? Followed immediately by Wrong. This linear invitation to a mugging was considered a strategy of wit. Many sentences carried with them their own congratulations, Suffice it to say... or, The only word for it is... Whether it really sufficed to say, or whether there was, in fact, another word, the sentence, bowing and applauding to itself, ignored. There existed also an economical device, the inverted-comma sneer—the ""plot,"" or his ""work,"" or even ""brave."" A word in quotation marks carried a somehow unarguable derision, like ""so-called"" or ""alleged."" It was hard to remember yesterday's polemic, to determine whether today's rebuttal was, in fact, an answer to it. Recalling arguments in order genuinely to refute them was an unrewarding exercise. A lot of bread, anyway, was buttered on the side of no distinction. God was not dead, but the Muse was extremely unwell.  
  
""Mutual"" meant common, shared, together, both, or simply somehow two-ish, as in our mutual hope, our mutual burden, mutual decision, mutual interest, mutual advantage, perhaps mutual camping trip. ""Agony"" could mean anything—usually, pending indictment; physical agony, in hospitals, was called discomfort, normally. ""Problem"" and ""personal tragedy"" meant crimes. ""Serene"" and ""out of touch with reality"" meant a given speaker trying to clear himself by intimating that the boss was crazy. ""He has suffered enough"" meant if we investigate this matter any further, it will turn out our friends are in it, too. A sufficiency of suffering, in public life, consisted in a loss of face perhaps, or office, or, earlier, in getting caught, or having lived in dread of being caught, or in committing crimes, or having wanted to commit them. And if the real sufferer was the public man in violation of the criminal law, and a sufficiency of suffering lay in his various states of mind, then it was perhaps everyone else who got off too easily. When a new President brought our national nightmare to an end by asking us to ""bind up the internal wounds,"" we knew that we were almost in the clear.  
  
While people tagged up on these public codes and incantations, baby talk took over private conversation —naughty and cranky, in particular. Personal treachery and acts of violence were naughty. Citizens in the middle of small betrayals or murder trials described themselves as in a cranky mood. Murders, generally, were called brutal and senseless slayings, to distinguish them from all other murders; nouns thus became glued to adjectives, in series, which gave an appearance of shoring them up. The concept of the jig itself being up, however, had retreated into thrillers. Intelligent people, caught at anything, denied it. Faced with evidence of having denied it falsely, people said they had not done it and had not lied about it, and didn't remember it, but if they had done it or lied about it, they would have done it and misspoken themselves about it in an interest so much higher as to alter the nature of doing and lying altogether. It was in the interest of absolutely nobody to get to the bottom of anything whatever. People were no longer ""caught"" in the old sense on which most people could agree. Induction, detection, the very thrillers everyone was reading were obsolete. The jig was never up. In every city, at the same time, therapists earned their living by saying, ""You're too hard on yourself.”

This was published in 1976 (shortly after Watergate).  This passage crystallizes what the whole book is doing: showing an intelligent person trying to make sense of a world where language, institutions, and shared reality are breaking down.

It's diagnosing how a society becomes unable to hold people accountable because the shared language necessary for judgment has been destroyed.",2,1767507294.0,ProsePorn,0,1.0,False

So yeah, this is just a post for myself to check later on, my goal is to reach masters playing this champion only in mid, no matter the matchup, as i'm currently doing, when i go top i mostly go sion and other shit so it isn't a 100% kassadin tho, wish me luck.

1q3if61,https://i.redd.it/b5cgherku9bg1.png,Focus Rewards: an app to reward myself for hard work and reading,"Hi guys,

[Focus Rewards](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/focus-rewards-study-timer/id6755358108), The idea is simple: reward myself for doing some work to do more work and reading.

With each completed session you roll a reward that you defined, in my case I treat my self with common rewards like drip coffee or premium dark chocolate for common rewards and hope to more rare rewards that I'm looking for like steak or ps5 game.

Additionally, it doesn't just start a static timer; it rolls a random duration from a range. This gives me some emotional feedback, because I'm relieved sometimes if I get low time and have sometimes this ""oh no"" in mind when I get high value, but still want to complete it.

Another angle is streak with luck booster, if you get 7 days streak your chances increase to get better reward. This keeps me to do at least one session to keep the luck booster.

For me it works quite well, but the important part is to define good rewards to treat myself.

**WDYT about those ideas?**

**Do you have any feature requests?**

I have in plans challenge / goal feature where you complete for example 50h of reading to get specific reward.

Any feedback would be appreciated! **Thanks :D**

He told me he had feelings for her, I told him not to confess and when he told me the back-story, I was like ""go for it dude"" that's where i fucked up. I didn't tell T about this and when she got to know that i knew all this after he confessed, she got very mad at me and literally scolded me for next 2 consecutive days. I somehow saved our bond and things were going right. Until 1 jan, she made joke about the incident pointing me after 1.5 months, I kinda got hurt and got mad at the same point.

If you are then i am sorry but this is so immature of you to just runaway and I could've done way worse to you but i didn't cuz i care about our bond.

Looking for help,"Hi everyone, (so, initially, I had posted this to Benzodiazapene subreddit and Benzo Buddies forum, but I as I researched, I began thinking that these issues could actually be related, not so much to the stopping of the xanax, but rather, to quitting caffeine. I'm coming here to ask for advice from anyone who has experienced similar symptoms to the ones that I've listed in the hopes of learning why this has happened. Thank you!)

Here is my original post, and it contains mostly at the beginning, info about my taking of xanax (since I thought this was the primary culprit to causing these awful symptoms) -

I would really, really appreciate some advice/guidance/opinions on my issue related to stopping (what has been a very low dose and short-term) Xanax a short time ago.

Here is a quick runthrough of my issue and how I arrived at it - I first took 3mg of xanax at the beginning of July of 2025 for flight anxiety for my trip over to Japan. I noticed a couple of weeks of insomnia from the jetlag (I presume, and not the 3mg of xanax) and nothing else out of the ordinary. The insomnia was awful however and did last upwards of 2 weeks which was odd I thought.

Fast forward to 4 months later;  
I ended up taking a total of 7mg of xanax over the next 1-2 months (randomly when I felt slightly anxious, I would take 0.25mg and 0.5mg intermittently, on random days to ease any feelings of slight anxiety I had. I took the pills 3 days in a row one or two times within those couple of months also. I really thought that wasn't something I should worry about, since I was told to not overthink things about taking such a low dose by a medical practitioner... But since my last tablet 12 days ago, I've had some pretty miserable symptoms;

Non-stop negative thoughts, obsessive rumination about my past, thoughts about s\*\*\*\*\*e (even though I want to live), worries about life, death... Dark depression, Horrible anxiety that brings with it hot and cold waves with sweat - my face turns bright red with heat. Intense dissociative symptoms; DPDR throughout the days...  
  
My brain also feels like it is burning and has felt that way for the past week, and my body feels like it is tingling, like an uncomfortable energy from within - night time is especially difficult - my heart rate goes so high...  
I have been having nights with zero sleep. The night after a zero sleep night, I will still struggle to get to sleep and it will be very broken and short (3-5 hours max)  
I've noticed that my hands tingle and start going numb, which is especially apparent in the morning time.  
There is a constant strange pressure behind my eyes and it seems to also surround my skull. A strange ""fuzzy"" sensation. It is a very uncomfortable feeling.

(Just to also mention, since these may also be playing a part in these horrible withdrawals - I cut out all caffeine (I drank a lot of energy drinks and sugary coffees over the years - upwards of 500mg daily which I definitely relied on for the ""kick"" - that boost to my mood every morning and day that I looked forward to) the same time I took the last xanax tablet, and also, I stopped playing video games (I used them to distract myself and dissociate - I decided to quit caffeine/sugar and games at the same time as that last xanax tablet, due to having a panic attack which I thought was due to the excess caffeine intake)

Can anyone tell me (or give me some hope) if this will pass soon? Is this kindling of some sort? An adverse, paradoxical reaction of some sort? I've been hearing that the amount of xanax I was taking shouldn't be giving me any of these difficult symptoms, yet I have them. This concerns me, since the symptoms are so awful - It feels akin to a ""comedown"" from a heavy ecstacy night (which I haven't experienced since me teenage years a couple of decades ago!)  
It has been 12 days now, and this has been very difficult...

Thanks for reading,

But long story short, I was in a loving and happy relationship for 4 years until she suddenly left me Christmas night after showing no signs anything was wrong between us and we had a great Christmas day together with my family.

This will be another long post btw.

After the breakup we still had to live together for at least a week until she moved out, so I've been sleeping in the living room and her in the bedroom. At first I would uncontrollably cry over the sudden loss of our 4 great years together. Then I got angry at the whole situation as I felt gaslit into believing that our relationship was the best it had ever been as her actions made me feel that way. Then I went numb and cold with her for a day or 2 because I thought it would help me move on but it wasn't easy when we had to still live together.

Eventually I actually began to come around to her way of thinking and thanked her for the last 4 years and wished her luck on her future. We hugged, we cried then we sat on the couch and reminisced about the relationship listing our favourite moments and what we are gonna miss about each other. It was lovely and she rested her head on my shoulder as we cried together. She promised me that this was simply something she has to do for herself, she said she couldn't sleep with someone straight away out of respect for what we had for each other and the love she still had for me. I believed her and made things easier so we could leave with peace and love in our hearts to go our separate ways and go no contact. I even began to make her coffee and breakfast in the mornings to keep things sweet.

New Year's Eve came. Initially she was gonna spend it with me 1 last time before she got an invite to go out with her girlfriends in another town, she decided to go because she thought being with me would hurt too much and we'd just be sad all night. She left at 4pm, gave me a handshake and said she would message me ""Happy New Year"" at midnight, I thought the handshake was a bit out of character but I pushed past it, then she left for the night and I never heard from her again. On NYE I decided to play some games with friends on PS5 so I wasn't alone and waited for her midnight text that never came, I had to fight the temptation to message her myself because I didn't want to seem pathetic. So I just stayed awake anxiously waiting for it to the point that it made me sick and I eventually passed out around 3am.

I woke up around 9am and still nothing from her until around 11am where she finally messages me wishing me a happy new year. I don't reply because I was so annoyed that she didn't think to do that at midnight like everyone else.  I then had to go into the bedroom to retrieve some of my clothes and heard her iPad was pinging notifications, it was annoying so I went to silence it and that's when I saw something on her lock screen. It was messages between her and the friend she was out with talking about her sleeping with another guy. She talked about how lovely he was, he made her breakfast and played with her hair, how she might be catching feelings and doesn't want it to be a 1 time thing. I immediately ran to the bathroom and threw up with disgust. While I was lying awake waiting on her message, she was in bed with another man.

She messages me again about 2 hours later telling me when she will be back home to finish packing up her things. My responses were so short because of what I knew that she picked up on it and called me to discuss what was wrong. I confronted her about what I saw and her argument was that she was single now and she can do what she wants. I got so angry at the principle of what she had done after only being single for a week, after being with me for 4 years, after promising me that she was leaving me to find herself properly and chase her career, after promising me she would never do something like this out of respect for me and our 4 years together, after seeing me in such an emotional wreck all week and exactly a week ago before she was having Christmas dinner with my family. I said, "" You're right, you are single and you can do what you want but the morality of what you've done is so disrespectful and shitty to do when you know how hard this has been for us this past week and you've just added unnecessary salt to the wound"". She says she was never gonna tell me and she doesn't regret it. We argued back and forth about it for about 20 minutes on the phone before she hung up. Then she messages me hours later apologising for hurting me and I just didn't care for her apology.

She returned to our home on 2nd January and we started splitting up all of our shared spaces and boxes. We would occasionally stop to discuss what happened   and at one point I thew up again at the thought of her being with another man the way we've been with each other for the last 4 years. Once all the major stuff was boxed up, I expressed how I felt 1 last time to try and get through to her before she left my life forever.

I tried to get through to her just how much this whole experienced has traumatised me and that I now believe I need to seek therapy. She made me believe for weeks/months/years that we were so in love with each other and had a great future planned out, she convinced everyone around me as well that we were happy including my family on Christmas day. If she had doubts at all early on then she should have communicated them with me so we could potentially fix things or end things earlier to prevent the heartbreak I have now. Instead she kept these feelings inside growing more and more until she maybe even built up a resentment for me and/or the relationship. So when she broke up with me Christmas night I was in utter shock. No matter what I said to her she showed no emotion at all or any remorse for what she's put me through this past week. When I would call her out on her lies and bs she would just shrug and go quiet and say she's just numb to it all now and just wants this over with. She did agree that she should've waited longer than a week to move on and apologised but it literally meant nothing to me. Whether she was drunk or not she knew full well what she was doing and must've know it would hurt me she just didn't expect me to find out.

Once the final boxes were packed up, she decided to go stay in a hotel for the night to get away from the situation. I told her I would be leaving to stay with family in the morning so she could move out in peace, so this was the last time we would ever see each other. Knowing this I suddenly broke down into tears and started full on ugly crying in front her, I wasn't begging her to stay I was just so sad that it had come to this when a week ago I was happy and planning to marry her. Seeing me like this, she did shed a few tears of her own and even offered me a hug. Since NYE I couldn't even touch her but I agreed to a hug and I held her so tightly until she said I have to let her go. She left to go to the hotel and I just collapsed onto the floor in our hallway in absolute agony and I cried so much for about an hour before calling my mother for support.

Today I've noticed she's blocked me on all socials and has only texted me to tell me her moving out progress but I've not been replying to her. I will be moving back into the flat once she texts me that she has fully moved out. I don't know what went wrong in our relationship at all to cause her to be this way out of absolutely nowhere. It's like a switch has gone off in her head and she's become dead behind the eyes. She is just moving on and I'm left behind to pick up the pieces. I can barely eat, I can barley sleep and I keep picturing her being intimate with that other guy like a jolt of lightning through my brain and my heartaches so much. I don't know what to do next or where I go from here, my life has been turned upside down in such a short period of time it feels like the woman I was in love with for 4 years has just been killed in front of me and her ghost is torturing me.",2,1767506097.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1q3hzr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImprovingEyesight/comments/1q3hzr3/my_methods_and_results/,My methods and results,"I seem to have successfully reduced my lenses from -3.00 to -1.75 over the course of about 3 years, and I thought it'd be fun to write up my methods and results! :)

I wear contact lenses, but I've written the below using the word ""glasses"".



**Laptop habits**

* When using a laptop, always face a window, rather than facing the interior of the room. This allows my eyes to get sunlight and also means that when I take breaks and look up, there are things at far distances that I can focus on.
   * Ideally, I'd sitting in from of ""picture"" windoww (floor-to-ceiling windows), like are often found in coffee shops.
* When using my laptop, often take breaks, look outside, and focus on things that are either at far distances.
   * Sometimes, I just look up for a moment or two, and sometimes I take breaks and stare outside.

  
**Sunlight habits**

* Take breaks several times during the day and walk around outside.
* Try to walk in areas of bright sunlight, but in such a way that the sun isn't directly in my eyes.
   * When the sun is directly in my eyes, hold up my hand in such a way that it blocks the sun and creates a little area of shade where my eyes are.



**Phone habits**

* Don't wear glasses when I'm in bed playing on my phone, and keep my phone as far away as possible, but at a distance where everything is clear and hasn't yet started become blurry.
* Play on my phone for at least 30 minutes before bed, after I've taken off my glasses. I usually do this in the total dark or at least in low lighting. This makes me yawn a bunch before I sleep, which produces tears and moistens my eyes, which in turn seems to noticeably improve my vision the next day.
* Similarly: Play on phone for \~20 minutes right after waking up, while lying in the dark. This seem to help my eyes slowly clear up and get moist, which in turn drastically helps my vision during the day.

  
**Other**

* In the morning, wait to put on my glasses until right before I leave the house. This seems to improve my vision a lot -- it's almost as though the first few minutes after putting one one's glasses cue your eye as to whether or not you need to be able to see far away that day.

  
**Lens reduction**

* Once my eyesight is perfect for long enough that I'm happy with it, I reduce my lense prescription by one level (0.25) (e.g. from -3.00 to -2.75).
   * Others have mentioned that if you're prescription is above 4.00/-4.00, you might as well reduce your prescription by 0.5 each time until you reach -3.00, then reduce by 0.25 each time.

  
**Results**

I started my eyesight journey wearing -3.00 lenses, and I now have near-perfect vision wearing -1.75 lenses! :)

On average, it took 7 months for my vision to become near-perfect every time I reduced my prescription:



|Prescription|Time worn|
|:-|:-|
|\-3.00|(Starting prescription)|
|\-2.75|1 month|
|\-2.50|6 months|
|\-2.25|18 months|
|\-2.00|4 months|
|\-1.75|(Currently a little over 4 months and seems to be almost stable)|

1q3hzou,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapyabuse/comments/1q3hzou/need_a_vibe_check/,need a vibe check,"long post so i bolded the main points.

i'm an asian person studying writing in grad school. I am seeing a white female therapist who specializes in cptsd/dissociation. she has lived experience with trauma and i believe it was actually likely worse than my trauma. She is critical of the mental health system and believes discrimination is real.

while i feel she does understand trauma, i don't feel she is a safe person; she seems to jump to conclusions about me (i'm changing the topic or avoiding things) and i don't feel like i'm really listened to. She also seems pretty harsh and too tough for me. Also, she reminds me of my old boss who was abusive, lol.

She has told me I'm sometimes out of touch with reality (but didn't give me examples?). She has told me that I minimize the abuse I had in childhood, while maximizing current issues. I don't believe I do maximize current issues, because I see bad things everywhere, and part of my existence is about picking up hints that people don't like me. She doesn't listen to me when I say that bad things are happening now. Social ostracization, professors or bosses not liking me. It's not maximizing to say everyone hates me, if, when I speak in class, they laugh behind their hands, or in the hallway, they don't even look at me.

She jumped to the conclusion that I think punishment works and that children can be abusers. I do think that I caused much of the family strife growing up, though I probably am a scapegoat, but I was mostly talking about my creative writing projects. I want to write short stories about bad people, weird situations where someone punishes themself, and asks, how much punishment is enough? I wasn't explaining this well in the session, but this would be an absurd story, unearthing, actually, how punishment *doesn't* work. And the story about a child abuser would examine what makes people good or bad (and, in fact, what *is* good or bad?), and the lenses we see people through. I was not actually advocating for punishment. But she sort of became a smart ass, and she was like, ""There are certain facts of life, children can't be abusers, punishment doesn't work, **your ideas aren't interesting or original.""**

I had come to session that day after spending a few nights sleeping in one of the academic buildings on campus as I am having horrible roommate issues, which she is aware of but has offered no help for. She also did not blink an eye when I told her I would sleep at the academic builing. At the academic building, security guards woke me up every few hours and it felt generally unsafe. So I was pretty sleep deprived. This whole spring, summer and fall was a disaster; I was bullied at school, up against a seemingly racist environment, or it was giving me flashbacks to racial trauma, and abused by the mental health system, my brother, and roommates. As a result, for many months, my schoolwork didn't go well and I was unable to think linearly. A few weeks ago, I stockpiled sleeping pills and alcohol. I have been self harming frequently this year and it has worsened.

So I did what I do when facing stress and the hate of the world. I finally snapped. I dressed nicely. I woke up. I told my therapist I was feeling very arrogant, that I would win the next academic award (I won an award for my work last year so it's not a complete fantasy, and I worked my ass off), and that I see no reason why, with hard work, I won't be able to rise to the top of my field.

She was immediately offended by this and said that arrogance is bad, only confidence is good, and it's time to try something new. She dismissively said, ""I'm sure you can win an award.""

I said I was inspired by a famous writer who believes in the somewhat woo-woo idea of the law of attraction/manifesting, and my therapist said sarcastically, ""Oh, I wish things would just fall into my lap."" I said this writer also believes in hard work, and manifesting is just acting in such a way that would befit what you want to become... so... I think it does work, because you're *not* just waiting around for things to fall into your lap.... I don't know why she jumped to the conclusion that I was a lazy fantasist.

**I don't know if i deserve her treatment because I did come in and I was acting angry, or rather, strident, because anger has been neccessary to keep going. I wasn't directing the anger at anyone in particular, though, I was just generally angry. In past sessions I've said I'm not sure I'm a good writer, and even in this session, I was talking about how my professor gave me feedback and I'm trying to figure out how to implement it. Her response to that was that I'm self abusive. What? I asked how it was self abusive if it's just a fact that this is an area I need to work on. I wish she would see things less rigidly, and see that what's happening externally isn't actually what is happening internally.**

Personally, I don't actually know if I am that arrogant in a bad sense of the word; I believe in hard work. Also, if I did not set high goals, I'd be stuck in a suicidal depression with no reason to get out of bed. My arrogance saved me. Also, when people believe you are a second class citizen, someone easy to laugh at, it does take some arrogance to believe that you, in fact, belong and can reach the top of your field. When everything is against you and there is evidence that you are worthless, it takes a lot of effort to get rid of that and rise up. Arrogance has its function in my life. Perhaps, then, what I have is actually confidence, but I'm not sure. I think confidence lacks the daring inherent in arrogance. and time and time again, I've needed to be daring because no one believes me, and no one wants me here at all. It takes arrogance not to be completely eroded. It takes arrogance not to die. **also, arrogance was sort of a joke, I'm none of these things, really, I'm just putting on an act.**

My writing professor actually praised me last year, saying, ""You have the arrogance to believe you have something important to say, and you also question yourself a lot, which means you work to make things perfect."" Perhaps my work as an artist really just means I need to have a different set of values than therapy dictates?

I told my therapist about how I got coffee with a classmate, who began to dissect my work and analyze it through the lens of ""is this a trauma plot, and are trauma plots bad?"" and I told my therapist that I don't view my work through that lens because I want to approach my fiction in a way that is not influenced by outside sources. (I think psychology has no place in fiction, because it draws lines around what's good or bad, right or wrong. It's rigid. In fiction, I think ""trauma"" should simply be called ""pain"". If you tell someone their *life* is trauma porn, it's a dismissal of pain, and fiction is where there should and can be space for pain, space for life to exist, without immediately being shot down).

Her response to this was: **""So you're going to shit all over your classmate?""**

This surprised me because I don't see how I was shitting on my classmate. I said, ""No, I want to be her friend, I just don't want to talk about work with her."" What I should have said was the following, though I still don't understand why my therapist thought I was shitting on her: I think my classmate's work is great, actually. I just want to protect my imagination. I don't want to write in a way where I'm only trying to fit into a certain category (such as writing a piece that could go under, for example a ""Strong Women"" category on Netflix). I don't see myself through that lens and I don't wish to see myself through *any lens at all.* Especially because there are so many preimposed lenses that the world views me through: Asian, Female, queer. I only want to be myself, outside of these labels, because the truth is I've never fit into any label.

here's what I did say: that my struggles and perspective make me interesting, and thus give me an interesting perspective, and that makes my work different; She said that was **""the dumbest thing I've ever heard""** and yet... while I'm at the beginning of my career, there's some evidence that my ethos works. Also, by saying that, she directly contradicted what she said earlier, that **""the only original thing you can bring to your work is what makes you unique/your unique take""**

the final thing that gives me pause is that in talking about family systems and how I couldn't have been the abuser of my family as a child. She said, ""There's hierarchy. I wouldn't go up to a police officer---**even as a white woman.""**

There was no reason for her to bring up race. I felt othered, actually, because I hadn't brought up race and now she's calling attention to our differences. I myself sought this woman out to be my therapist, so I thought we could work together...

She asked me if I believe there is hierarchy. This, to me, feels like an odd way of asking me if I accept that I'm a second class citizen. I do believe discrimination and racism and sexism exist. So I said, ""Sure, hierarchy exists, but if I go around always thinking about how things are rigged against me, I might as well kill myself."" Because I might as well not try, then.

Then a few moments later, I was trying to get into some of the things my parents had been through that might effect me through generational trauma, and I said, ""Well, I don't know, in America...""

And she said, **""Are you going to say I can't understand because I'm an American?""**

That has flummoxed me, because that's not what I was going to say. In fact, I was going to say that my parents from a country that has seen massive instability due to many wars on home soil, years of colonization, generations of people fleeing, widespread poverty, addiction, and gambling due to war and colonization on a level America has not seen, and my parents were starving, etc. So... no, I wasn't going to say she couldn't understand, but I was perhaps saying that my experience *is* different. Yes, there is trauma and there are horrific things in America, but... I'm pretty sure it is different.

Then I said that in fact I don't know my parents very much so I might as well be from nowhere, and that does make me special and different, as I'm not American, but I'm also definitely not from anywhere I know, as my family's abuse of me meant that I didn't learn any cultural traditions from them.... Perhaps this does fuel my writing, you know?

But I don't know if I said that to appease my therapist into thinking I'm not other.

I just feel weird. In life, people can say anything about my writing and I understand that it's about my writing and not me. But in the therapy room, I'm finding that I am extremely offended that my therapist, who has said she doesn't read fiction, thinks she has the right to tell me whether or not my ideas are interesting. I am not as strong as she thinks and had to cancel our next appointment in order to protect my imagination. She told me it's time to try a new approach to life, but I feel she hasn't even listened to what arrogance does for me, and why I turned to it. She doesn't think about what arrogance means *for me*. She jumps to all sorts of conclusions about me, seems to think I'm not taking therapy seriously, displays rigid black and white thinking, and I saw a glint of hatred in her eye when I said I think I'm a bad person and will harm children, clarifying that I won't, but my mother would blame me for killing my dad because of my difficult behavior, and how I was the one who caused our family to suffer. I'm starting to think she doesn't like me or respect me, and I'm not sure that she is safe.

I'm not sure if I should quit this therapist. She does seem to know about trauma, and I like that she is critical of the mental health field. But she is, frankly, scary, seemingly dysregulated and prone to taking her personal problems out on me, and seems to enjoy gaslighting me into thinking I'm seeing things wrong rather than even taking the time to hear me out. I'm also concerned by what she has said about race, even if she seems well meaning. She doesn't listen to me, and accuses me of changing topics, and told me several weeks ago that it's too late to find a seasonal job, and that dropping out or taking a semester off is self sabotaging. I wish she hadn't just shut the conversation down like that because I really did need help around functioning. I feel like I'm wasting my time in school as I'm not functioning and need a semester off to regroup.

I don't want to start over with a new therapist because... she may be the best therapist out there. (if this is the best, then that says a lot about the field). i might just have to keep my work and my immigrant/race issues to myself... and those are a big part of my life...",2,1767505865.0,therapyabuse,0,1.0,False

1q3hy4k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3hy4k,"Hong Kong felt familiar, Chongqing felt unreal — my honest China trip","I just got back from a 14-day China trip (Hong Kong → Chongqing → Zhangjiajie → Shanghai), and instead of posting skyline photos like everyone else, I ended up documenting my trip through coffee and tea shops.

Not on purpose at first — but I realized those stops said more about each city than the views.

⸻

🇭🇰 Hong Kong — familiar, polished

I came to Hong Kong mainly for SIGGRAPH, which was a great experience.

Outside the event, the city felt exactly how I’d always imagined it from movies and TV. Very polished, very international, very brand-focused.

I didn’t really connect with the food scene, but I did enjoy stopping for drinks while walking the city. Sitting down with locals helped me understand why Hong Kong feels closer to a European city — the British influence is  present.

Good experience — but not a city I feel the need to revisit.

⸻

🇨🇳 Chongqing — unreal energy

Then came Chongqing… and everything changed.

Neon lights everywhere, layered city streets, incredible street smells, nonstop movement. This was the moment I thought:

“Okay — THIS is China.”

Every night felt alive. Every walk led to something unexpected. Even grabbing a tea felt like part of the experience.

I also saw pandas here — easily my favorite city of the entire trip.

⸻

🌄 Zhangjiajie — calm & human

Zhangjiajie was the opposite of Chongqing.

Quiet. Natural. Grounding.

I explored the mountains without a tour guide, just a map and a lot of walking. I got lost more than once — and every time, locals stopped to help me find my way. Truly kind people.

Huge shout-out to Qishi Li Cave Homestay — one of the best places I’ve ever stayed. The staff helped me with tickets, directions, and anything I needed.

⸻

🇨🇳 Shanghai — modern city life

Shanghai was mainly for shopping and city life.

I visited:

	•	Louis Vuitton Cruise

	•	Starbucks Reserve Roastery

	•	Shanghai Disneyland 🎢

I tried TRON Lightcycle Power Run — easily one of the most exciting rides I’ve ever been on.

Final thoughts:

	•	Hong Kong: familiar, polished, international

	•	Chongqing: raw, energetic, unforgettable

	•	Zhangjiajie: peaceful, kind, adventurous

	•	Shanghai: modern, busy, stylish

If you’re planning China and want something that doesn’t feel staged, don’t skip Chongqing.

shout-out to r/Winnetravel — she helped me plan the itinerary and guided me toward the right cities, timing, and experiences. That planning made a huge difference to how smooth and enjoyable the trip was.

I’m an introvert (25F) not socially anxious (I talk to people a lot for work), just not into socializing. I just got off my 9-5, looking tired and with a bare face, when a guy approached me and said I was pretty. Honestly, it made me uncomfortable, or maybe I’m just being a bi***

Today I went shopping at store X (keeping it anonymous). I was pushing my cart in the container section and noticed some nice glass jars. I was thinking of maybe buying one to store my homemade milk tea. While I was looking, he started approaching me, he said he wanted to get to know me.

After a bit of conversation, he asked for my phone number or Instagram. I hesitated and said something like “sure?” and gave him my Instagram QR code to scan. He sent a request, but I didn’t approve because I honestly wasn’t impressed. While we were talking, I kept glancing at the jars to show that I wasn’t interested. I don’t know if he noticed.

What made me most uncomfortable was that he didn’t smile at all, he just talked while staring straight into my eyes, with no expression, emotionless which felt really intense and unsettling.

Eventually he backed off, saying he didn’t want to take up my time and suggested grabbing coffee sometime. I agreed just to end the conversation, but I had zero interest. Part of me felt like he didn’t have good intentions, and his way of interacting crossed my personal boundaries.He also asked if I lived nearby, and I gave a vague answer “I live nearby, in ‘XXX’.” After he walked away, I overheard him repeating “XXX” to someone else, which felt even weirder.

Overall, that interaction completely killed my mood, and I lost all interest in buying that glass jar.",3,1767505417.0,introvert,5,1.0,False
1q3htps,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDesolateGames/comments/1q3htps/my_attempt_at_trying_to_predict_the_desolate/,My Attempt at Trying to Predict The Desolate Abandon's Plot,"I think most people know what The Desolate Abandon is, but for the people who don't know I'll explain it. The Desolate Abandon was a planned sequel for The Desolate Hope during his decision between making Five Nights at Freddy's or a The Legacy of Flan remake before leaving game development and getting a new career. He would pick FNaF and safe to say, he wasn't leaving anytime soon after that. Despite this he would make a [Steam comment in 2016 ](https://steamcommunity.com/app/388090/discussions/0/364040961444808479/#c364040961445094168)hinting at the possibility of TDA still happening some day in the future. (Which hasn't happened yet)

Now getting to the point, I will try to predict what the plot of The Desolate Abandon could've been. This could be an impossible task, but I will try my best.

In some old [Steam comments Scott made in 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20150502041700/http://steamcommunity.com/app/298180/discussions/0/558754899947701091#c558755530664419578), he talks about needing funding and support to work on the sequel (This was when The Desolate Hope still cost money on Steam). This implies Scott had already have ideas on what The Desolate Abandon could be about, which would be a shocker if you know how TDH ends. This could go down two paths: similar to The Desolate Room, The Desolate Abandon is a spiritual successor to The Desolate Hope where it doesn't explicitly continue from the ending and becomes a separate game that's inspired from TDH that possibly keeps the characters Alphus and Coffee but slightly different, or it does continue from the TDH ending. For simplicity sakes I will go with the latter and predict TDA will be a continuation of TDH.

Spoilers, but the ending for TDH ends with Coffee successfully shutting down him, the Derelicts' simulations and everything else to give enough power to supply the Theta simulation that contains Sample 217 and now Coffee to comfort and finally give Sample 217 the childhood they deserve. We then later see the Derelicts were put into Sleep Mode and have their mission read as a success on a panel with Sigfried the spider crawling past. It is a bittersweet ending but unfortunately, I have to ruin it.... or do I?.. Yeah no, I don't have a good idea how not to ruin it, I'm sorry (maybe somebody else does).

In TDH, the viruses Negmanity, Ger Garun and PULSAR have an attack called ""Sleep Mode"" that stops the Derelicts' turn bar for a few minutes. Sleep Mode is a very important function the story revolves around which is being referenced as an attack. Well believe it or not there is also an attack called ""Abandon"". Hey, wait a minute, that's the name of the planned sequel!! What's even more interesting is the attack isn't reused for any characters besides Ger Garun and Viren. This could mean something but first let me explain what the Abandon attack even does. The Abandon attack inflicts your Derelicts the ""Drain"" status that quickly drains the HP of them. Knowing Sleep Mode is similar to the actual Sleep Mode where it deactivates the Derelicts and stops them from doing anything, this could mean the plot of TDA could revolve around the Derelicts having their life drained. We know the Derelict's energy is being drained into Theta but we already know that unless TDA is just TDH all over again but instead of Lun Infinus its the Derelicts, which would be lame and unlikely, unless it would've been a rushed sequel. -\_\_\_-

But I'm going to be a little bit more optimistic and maybe it's about Amos and the Theta simulation quickly losing energy and life that we have to stop to ensure Sample 217 and Coffee lives on forever. Now how do we stop this from happening? Don't know but maybe the characters who have the attack could give some kind of hint. There could be a connection made between why Negmanity and PULSAR have Sleep Mode attacks: PULSAR is like the main boss so he GOTS to have it, and Negmanity is Mirad's Anti-Virus and this is significant because Mirad is the Derelict who is most focused on trying to find a solution to the Sleep Mode problem the scientists put on them. Now what does this tell us about Ger Garun and Viren? Well Ger Garun has ""Sleep Mode"" and ""Abandon"", which could mean Ger Garun (or Alphus) would be the most important in TDA's story. Unsure about Viren so maybe he becomes the main boss of TDA. This doesn't really tell us that much but enough to get a vague idea what TDA could be about. Maybe D-Co 9 is alive somehow and has to travel through dead/abandoned simulations to find a solution or travel outside Lun Infinus and into another station on another planet or planet's moon and steal stuff from those Derelict's simulations (who are most likely dead and abandon with low energy) to bring to Amos.

But that's I got so far, I hope you enjoyed reading this. Sorry if this didn't really help but maybe you guys have a better idea or prediction, please let me know and others if you do!

Don't worry, maybe someday The Desolate Abandon will happen and if it does, I hope it has similar effort and passion TDH had! Who knows what the future might bring, we did see Coffee recently referenced in that FNaF Secret of Mimic game, which has me thinking Scott hasn't fully forgotten about TDH yet!

1q3hqcf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3hqcf,"Hong Kong felt familiar, Chongqing felt unreal — my honest China trip","I just got back from a 14-day China trip (Hong Kong → Chongqing → Zhangjiajie → Shanghai), and instead of posting skyline photos like everyone else, I ended up documenting my trip through coffee and tea shops.

Not on purpose at first — but I realized those stops said more about each city than the views.

⸻

🇭🇰 Hong Kong — familiar, polished

I came to Hong Kong mainly for SIGGRAPH, which was a great experience.

Outside the event, the city felt exactly how I’d always imagined it from movies and TV. Very polished, very international, very brand-focused.

I didn’t really connect with the food scene, but I did enjoy stopping for drinks while walking the city. Sitting down with locals helped me understand why Hong Kong feels closer to a European city — the British influence is  present.

Good experience — but not a city I feel the need to revisit.

⸻

🇨🇳 Chongqing — unreal energy

Then came Chongqing… and everything changed.

Neon lights everywhere, layered city streets, incredible street smells, nonstop movement. This was the moment I thought:

“Okay — THIS is China.”

Every night felt alive. Every walk led to something unexpected. Even grabbing a tea felt like part of the experience.

I also saw pandas here — easily my favorite city of the entire trip.

⸻

🌄 Zhangjiajie — calm & human

Zhangjiajie was the opposite of Chongqing.

Quiet. Natural. Grounding.

I explored the mountains without a tour guide, just a map and a lot of walking. I got lost more than once — and every time, locals stopped to help me find my way. Truly kind people.

Huge shout-out to Qishi Li Cave Homestay — one of the best places I’ve ever stayed. The staff helped me with tickets, directions, and anything I needed.

⸻

🇨🇳 Shanghai — modern city life

Shanghai was mainly for shopping and city life.

I visited:

	•	Louis Vuitton Cruise

	•	Starbucks Reserve Roastery

	•	Shanghai Disneyland 🎢

I tried TRON Lightcycle Power Run — easily one of the most exciting rides I’ve ever been on.

Final thoughts:

	•	Hong Kong: familiar, polished, international

	•	Chongqing: raw, energetic, unforgettable

	•	Zhangjiajie: peaceful, kind, adventurous

	•	Shanghai: modern, busy, stylish

If you’re planning China and want something that doesn’t feel staged, don’t skip Chongqing.

shout-out to @Winnetravel — she helped me plan the itinerary and guided me toward the right cities, timing, and experiences. That planning made a huge difference to how smooth and enjoyable the trip was.

With hands delicately turning the knob to the front door, Elise held her breath. Upon hearing the absence of any audible sound of the latch sliding into place they stepped backwards through the threshold of the bedroom door. The expression on her face was one of immense relief. “Crisis adverted, “ she mouthed to herself as she took a beat in front of the door. All she could do now was cross her fingers and toes for at least a couple of silence and reprieve. While it was an honor to be the comfort and predictability for such a small being, the lines of where her body began and its utility ended were somewhat crossed. It wasn’t the first time this occurred over the past few months of settling into their new roles in life. Some days were in fact much easier than others, but the past 72 had been much more arduous. 

Aware that the difficulty would wax after waning, Elise was determined to make the most of the early morning. Elise coveted mornings alone. Their routine was ritualistic. She’d dress in the clothes she’d laid out clothes the night before. Enjoy a quiet breakfast of oats and fruit with various seeds and supplements atop. And soon enough after she’d retire to the large rocking chair in the corner of their living room that over looked a large window. Elise would recline back, tucked tightly into a layer of blankets to read, journal, daydream, whisper wishes into the coffee or tea she’d poured. Life had changed so much in such a short amount of time. ",1,1767504952.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

Cut myself on a chipped coffee mug while washing dishes. I ended up not going to a walk in clinic because I dont have the money for that and there was nothing to stitch. The whole piece was just a flap hanging on by a little bit of skin. You could see muscle and fat under it so it was definitely deep, about 1"" by 1/2"" ish in length and width. We tried to butterfly stitch it and put a bandaid over it but they kept falling off. It bled all day, i went through two bandaids in 4 hours because it was bleeding through. I ended up buying some nonstick pads and gauze and wrapped it up which has been working well.

Day 1
 Jet lag, palaces, and street food
I started slow. Gyeongbokgung was my first stop and honestly, seeing the palace with mountains behind it didn’t feel real. Bukchon right after was beautiful but crowded I learned quickly that Seoul wakes up early.
By evening, Myeongdong saved me. Hot tteokbokki, grilled skewers, warm hands, neon lights… perfect after a long day of walking.

Day 2
 Trendy streets & quiet corners
Hongdae was loud, fun, and full of energy buskers everywhere, people just enjoying life. After that, Ikseon-dong felt like a pause button. Tiny cafés hidden in old houses, sitting quietly while the city rushed outside.
 
At night, I went up to Namsan Seoul Tower. The wind was cold, but the city lights made it worth standing there longer than planned.

Day 3
 Slow Seoul hits differently
The Han River morning surprised me the most. People biking, couples sitting silently, coffee in hand it didn’t feel like a capital city.

Gwangjang Market was chaotic but comforting. I ate standing up, shared tables with strangers, and realized food really connects people here. Ended the day in Seongsu, just wandering without a plan

I’ll give you the most pressing examples of the kind of person I am: 



-  I threw a pill bottle at my 16m brother in the car when I was 18

When we were in the car we were frustrated with each other- then he started making fun of me for not being able to drive yet (I was in a car accident that totaled our car when I was 16- and due to my already preexisting mental illness and untreated adhd- it delayed me, although I do admit it is a bit silly that I was a grown adult not able to drive). Anyways I threw my pill bottle at him, hopped out of the car, flipped him off and went to school until I was sent to the hospital and spent a week in the ward because I stupidly told the teacher some stuff..when I got home… annnnddd wasted money..

-  I ran away for a brief period of time on a car trip.

I don’t know why I did this it’s really stupid immature and selfish- basically I talk my mouth off a lot and get obsessed with certain topics- like something I’m excited for. So in the car everyone got pretty pissed off at me- as family car trips go- they’d eventually snap- saying some not so pleasant but warranted things. “You’re annoying, this is why nobody likes you, you never just shut up, you ruin everything.” Coming from my mother, Brother, and a little from my father. So I hop out (the vehicle was in a short line), and I walk a ways until my father confronts me- I ask him if they’re still going to berate me- he calls me immature (which I was), and I (not wanting to be in the car again to be berated- choose to stay out for a while and wander the town.) They then drive off and pretend they are leaving me (So I wander and try to find a place to get information so I could find a place to stay like a roadside or something). Apparently they were just joking with me that they left me and were already an hour away- they had just gotten themselves lunch and went sightseeing. I kinda deserved that ngl. 

-  I punched my dad in the face. 

When we arrived at where we were staying my brother continued to say the previous things- so I got a little upset. Travel is generally hard on me (for unknown reasons)??- 
I started crying and freaking out (and idk what I was saying tbh I just started weeping and complaining.) 
I guess I was being too loud and my father grabbed me from behind and restrained my arms as a punishment- so I wiggled loose and attempted punching him in the face. I did but it was pretty light luckily. He threw me against the Tv (deservedly).

- I threw coffee on the ground in my house. 

I woke up one morning to my parents who made some plans I was not aware of- and I started telling them about why they wouldn’t work out and how I wished they asked me. They called me a brat and stuff. I started crying and telling them I wasn’t trying to be and that I appreciated them and that I wasn’t trying to interfere- But that it was their fault for not asking me ahead of time- and (understandably) my father yet again restrained me. I had a coffee cup in hand and I threw it at the floor and he grabbed me and threw me down a flight of stairs (lol). 

-   Flirted and almost got together with someone who was 16 when I was 19

Me and the same kid that I was talking about above started flirting and we even gave each other kisses on the cheek. I immediately asked their age when we started genuinely texting- but they just replied with “junior” and I was a senior- so my careless dumbass assumed we were not that far apart in age. It was until I figured out they were also consecutively dating a freshmen that I realized I may have misjudged the situation. I then asked for more specifics and had a serious conversation- and he told me he was 16. I was 18 turning 19 shortly- so I cut off the relationship- but I should have been less careless and gross. 

-  I actively encourage and aid my minor friends in illegal behavior.

We walk on the tracks and go under bridges. I bought all of us spraypaint and I help them steal Barb wire off of fences. One is 17, one is 15, and one is 14.

-  Basically I was 5 or 6.  I remember wrestling with a boy around my age (I think I genuinely dunno how old this kid was), and he started saying things about my gender and stuff, and how I was weak, and that women were stupid, and similar things alike. I did the same but replace women with Asian. He (rightfully) got upset and that’s when I realized what I did really effected him, so I apologized to him, but it doesn’t matter because I was still racist and what happened was awful. I got another post abt it.


- I’m a hoarder. Yeah just that. I keep everything other than the obvious gross stuff like napkins and used stuff. I can get rid of things, but I also can’t walk in the room i live in because I have so much.

- I’ve engaged in some crazy shit online from 15-18 years old. 

- I’m gay and that’s kind of a moral failing in my eyes.

I'm biased and need clarity. Shortened for wordcount.

**Note:** 

* Amy is an introvert, a bit quirky, and struggles to make friends. 
* We briefly had romantic feelings, it did not work out, but we agreed to stay friends. None of my friends know this.

Against my advice, Amy third-wheeled an international trip and ruined her friendship with her best friend. I felt bad so I invited her to Friendsgiving. I knew she really needed a friend and I knew she really liked the homeowners (Mark and Cindy who were pregnant).

Days prior to event we had a couple meetups which were geared towards what she wanted to do. Personally, I work from home and hate being stuck indoors (literally everyone knows this) but I relented because she was having a rough time.

On the last meetup, after finishing up work together at coffee shop together, I **explicitly** **suggested doing something outdoors (i.e. tennis, running, swimming)**. Amy agreed but when we met up at my place so I could drop off my laptop, she changed her mind stating “I don’t feel like it. I’m sleepy” and dismissed me by going to sleep. On my couch. 

I was stunned, annoyed, and told her well leaving. I silently got ready and ignored her. She noticed and said something like “what's wrong with you? You’re being passive aggressive. It’s not like we made any concrete plans. Besides, you can still play volleyball so what’s the big deal”. We got into an argument where she ended it stating I’m gaslighting her into thinking she’s a bad friend, not to text her, and stormed off. 

Sometime later Amy messaged the group and said she'd be bringing drinks to Friendsgiving. **Alcoholic drinks**. I was shocked and privately messaged her “**It’s inconsiderate to bring drinks. Cindy's pregnant and that’s borderline tone-deaf. I could have kept silent but take this as a wakeup call. You need to put effort to build friendships and what you’re doing isn’t enough**”. 

This isn't the first time she's done this. Every gathering I've invited her to, besides one, she's always brought stuff Cindy couldn't consume. 

She said she had Cindy’s permission and accused me of shaming her to punish her over our recent fight. She was right-the wording would have been kinder if that argument had not just happened.

I ignored that, re-sent a list of Cindy’s dietary restrictions, and told her everyone else is accommodating so don't be the only one. 

I eventually confirmed with Cindy about this and she did give Amy permission. Mark though stated it was still inconsiderate. 

**On the day of Friendsgiving, Amy backed out saying she was too sick to attend.**

**However, she did end up buying a bunch of alcohol and gave it to someone else attending for her.** I don’t know if that was to spite me or because she wanted to maintain good relations with everyone. Either way, I know I could have handled it better.",0,1767504552.0,AmItheAsshole,32,0.43,False

1q3hi0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverMadeEasy/comments/1q3hi0b/travel_insurance_for_schengen_visa/,Travel Insurance for Schengen Visa,"I'll never forget the email I got from a traveler last year. She'd been planning her Europe trip for months—flights booked, hotels reserved, two weeks off work approved. Her Schengen visa application? Rejected. The reason? Her travel insurance didn't explicitly state ""valid in all Schengen countries."" She thought any travel insurance would work.

It didn't.

If you're applying for a Schengen visa, your insurance isn't just recommended—it's a legal requirement under EU regulation. And not just any insurance works. The policy needs to meet specific criteria, or your visa application gets tossed. No second chances until you reapply with proper coverage.

So what exactly makes insurance ""Schengen-compliant?"" And where do you find affordable options that actually get approved? Let's dig in.

✅ **Quick Answer**

For a Schengen visa, you need travel medical insurance with:

* Minimum **€30,000 coverage** for medical emergencies
* Valid in **all 29 Schengen countries**
* Coverage for **medical evacuation and repatriation**
* Certificate showing exact dates and coverage details
* Cost: €1.50-€5 per day depending on provider

# Do You Actually Need Schengen Visa Insurance?

Here's the thing: not everyone traveling to Europe needs a Schengen visa. But if you DO need one, insurance is mandatory. Non-negotiable.

**You need a Schengen visa (and therefore insurance) if:**

* You're from a country that requires visas for Schengen entry (India, Philippines, China, Thailand, Russia, and many others)
* You're staying longer than 90 days in the Schengen area
* Your passport doesn't fall under the EU's visa-free regime

**You DON'T need a visa if:**

* You're from the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, or other visa-exempt countries
* You're staying 90 days or less

But here's what trips people up: even if you're visa-exempt and don't legally need insurance to enter, you absolutely should have it anyway. European healthcare is expensive. A single ER visit can run €2,000-€5,000. Without insurance, you're paying out of pocket.

Think of it this way: the visa requirement forces smart behavior. Don't skip coverage just because you can legally enter without it.

# What Are the Schengen Visa Insurance Requirements?

The European Union doesn't mess around with visa insurance. Article 15 of EU Regulation 810/2009 spells out exactly what your policy must include. Here are the five hard requirements:

# 1. Minimum Coverage of €30,000

Your policy must cover at least **€30,000** (approximately $32,500) in medical expenses. This includes emergency medical treatment, hospitalization, and any related costs.

Can you go higher? Absolutely. Many policies offer €50,000, €100,000, or even more. But €30,000 is the floor. Anything less = automatic rejection.

# 2. Valid in All Schengen Countries

Your insurance must explicitly state it covers **all 29 Schengen member states**. That includes:

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland

Even if you're only visiting France and Italy, your certificate needs to show coverage across the entire Schengen zone. Embassy officers check this—trust me.

# 3. Medical Evacuation and Repatriation Coverage

This is the clause that catches people off guard. Your policy must cover:

* **Medical evacuation**: Emergency transport to adequate medical facilities or back to your home country
* **Repatriation of remains**: Costs associated with returning your body home if you die abroad (morbid, but required)

Many standard travel insurance policies skip the repatriation clause. That's why you can't just use your credit card's travel insurance for a Schengen visa—it often doesn't include repatriation.

# 4. Valid for Your Entire Stay

Your insurance must cover **every single day** you'll be in the Schengen area. If your trip is June 1-15, your insurance better start June 1 and run through June 15 or later.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Add a buffer. If your planned departure is June 15, extend coverage through June 17. Flight delays happen. If your actual return date exceeds your insurance dates, that's grounds for visa issues.

# 5. Zero Deductible Requirement

Some sources state Schengen visa insurance requires a **$0 deductible** with 100% coverage after that. While this isn't universally enforced, many embassies prefer or require it. When in doubt, choose a plan with no deductible.

⚠️ **Important**: Your insurance certificate is a required document for your visa application. Without it, your application won't even be processed. The certificate must clearly show all five requirements above in writing.

# How Much Does Schengen Visa Insurance Cost?

The good news? Schengen visa insurance is surprisingly affordable. You're looking at **€1.50 to €5 per day** depending on the provider and your age.

Here's a breakdown based on actual pricing from major providers:

|Trip Length|Budget Option|Mid-Range|Premium|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**7 days**|€17 (MondialCare)|€20 (AXA Basic)|€35 (Mutuaide Premium)|
|**30 days**|€45 (Mutuaide Basic Lite)|€60 (Allianz)|€100+ (AXA Essential)|
|**90 days**|€135 (Mutuaide Basic Lite)|€180 (AXA Basic)|€300+ (Premium plans)|

For a **25-year-old traveler** on a one-week trip, you're paying about **€2-3 per day**. That's less than a coffee in Paris.

# What Affects the Price?

Three main factors drive cost:

1. **Your age**: Older travelers pay more. Rates jump significantly after age 65.
2. **Trip duration**: The longer your stay, the higher the total cost (but daily rate often drops)
3. **Coverage level**: €30,000 minimum coverage costs less than €100,000+ plans

For most visa applicants, the **€30,000 minimum coverage is perfectly adequate**. Unless you have specific health concerns or want extra coverage for trip cancellation and lost luggage, stick with basic plans.

# Best Schengen Visa Insurance Providers

Not all insurance companies are accepted by Schengen embassies. You need a recognized provider with explicit Schengen compliance. Here are the top options I recommend:

# AXA Schengen

**Coverage**: €30,000-€100,000  
**Price**: Starting at €5/day  
**Best For**: Travelers wanting an established name with instant certificate

AXA is probably the most widely recognized Schengen insurance provider. Their basic plan starts at €5 per day and covers exactly what you need for visa approval. You get an instant certificate download after purchase, and embassies worldwide accept it without question.

The downside? It's pricier than some alternatives. But you're paying for reliability and zero hassle.

**Pros**:

* Instant certificate download
* Universally accepted by embassies
* Optional add-ons for baggage protection
* Refund if visa is denied

**Cons**:

* Higher cost than budget options
* Basic plan only covers Schengen (not UK/Ireland)

# Mutuaide Basic Lite

**Coverage**: €30,000  
**Price**: Starting at €1.50/day  
**Best For**: Budget-conscious travelers wanting the bare minimum

If you're looking for the absolute cheapest Schengen-compliant insurance, Mutuaide wins. At €45 for 30 days, it's hard to beat on price. The coverage is basic—exactly €30,000, nothing extra—but it meets all visa requirements.

You won't get fancy perks like trip cancellation or baggage coverage. But for a visa application? It works.

**Pros**:

* Cheapest option available
* €0 deductible
* 24/7 travel assistance
* COVID-19 coverage included

**Cons**:

* Bare minimum coverage (no extras)
* Less established brand name
* Longer claims processing in some cases

# SafetyWing Nomad Insurance

**Coverage**: $250,000 (far exceeds €30,000 requirement)  
**Price**: Starting at $56/4 weeks (ages 10-39)  
**Best For**: Digital nomads, travelers already abroad, or anyone wanting flexible coverage

Here's where SafetyWing stands out: you can **buy it while already traveling**. Most Schengen insurance requires you to purchase before leaving home. SafetyWing doesn't. Already in Thailand and need to apply for a Schengen visa from there? No problem.

The Essential plan provides a Schengen visa certificate instantly and covers well above the €30,000 minimum. Multiple travelers have confirmed embassy acceptance.

The trade-off? It's subscription-based (auto-renews every 28 days) and slightly more expensive than bare-minimum options. But for the flexibility and higher coverage, it's worth it.

**Pros**:

* Can purchase while already abroad
* $0 deductible
* Covers 180+ countries under one plan
* Instant Schengen certificate
* Higher coverage ($250,000) than minimum required

**Cons**:

* Subscription model (auto-renews)
* More expensive than budget options
* No pre-existing condition coverage on Essential plan

# Atlas International

**Coverage**: $50,000-$1,000,000  
**Price**: Starting at \~$8/week for 25-year-olds  
**Best For**: US-based travelers needing Schengen compliance

Atlas International offers solid coverage at reasonable prices, especially for younger travelers. The $50,000 coverage meets Schengen requirements, and you get acute onset pre-existing condition coverage (up to the policy maximum for those under 80).

**Pros**:

* Affordable for young travelers
* Acute onset pre-existing condition coverage
* Up to $25,000 emergency evacuation
* Flexible deductible options

**Cons**:

* Only covers travelers under age 70
* May require contacting support for visa letter

# Allianz Travel

**Coverage**: €30,000+  
**Price**: Starting at €5/day  
**Best For**: Travelers wanting comprehensive protection and global brand recognition

Allianz is one of the biggest insurance companies globally. Their Schengen plans offer reliable coverage with excellent customer support. You're paying a bit more, but you get 24/7 assistance and a name embassies trust immediately.

**Pros**:

* Globally recognized brand
* Comprehensive coverage options
* 24/7 customer support
* Optional add-ons available

**Cons**:

* Higher price point
* Can be overkill if you only need basic coverage

# How to Buy Schengen Visa Insurance

Buying Schengen insurance is straightforward once you know what to look for. Here's the process:

# Step 1: Confirm Your Travel Dates

Before shopping for insurance, nail down your **exact travel dates**. Your insurance must cover every day in the Schengen area, so you need to know:

* Entry date to Schengen zone
* Exit date from Schengen zone
* Any potential delays or extensions

Add a 1-2 day buffer on both ends if possible.

# Step 2: Choose a Provider

Pick from the recognized providers above. For most travelers:

* **Tightest budget**: Mutuaide Basic Lite (€1.50/day)
* **Best value**: AXA Basic (€5/day)
* **Most flexibility**: SafetyWing ($56/4 weeks)
* **Highest coverage**: Atlas International or Allianz

# Step 3: Purchase Online

All major Schengen insurance can be bought online in minutes. You'll need:

* Your full name (as it appears on your passport)
* Date of birth
* Nationality
* Travel dates
* Payment method (credit card)

# Step 4: Download Your Certificate

Immediately after purchase, you'll receive an insurance certificate. This is the document you submit with your visa application. It should clearly state:

* Your name and date of birth
* Coverage amount (minimum €30,000)
* ""Valid in all Schengen countries"" or similar wording
* Exact coverage dates
* Emergency contact information
* Policy number

Print this certificate and include it with your visa application documents.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Save a digital copy on your phone. Border officers can ask to see proof of insurance when you enter the Schengen area, even after your visa is approved.

# 7 Common Mistakes That Get Visa Applications Rejected

After years of helping travelers navigate Schengen visa applications, I've seen the same insurance mistakes pop up repeatedly. Avoid these:

# 1. Insurance Coverage Starts After Arrival

Your insurance must be **valid from the moment you enter** the Schengen area. If your flight lands on June 1 but your insurance starts June 2, that's grounds for rejection.

✅ **Correct**: Insurance starts on or before your arrival date  
❌ **Wrong**: Insurance starts the day after arrival

# 2. Submitting a Screenshot Instead of Official Certificate

Don't take a screenshot of your policy details and submit that. Embassies want the **official certificate PDF** from your insurance provider.

✅ **Correct**: Download the certified PDF certificate from your insurance company  
❌ **Wrong**: Screenshot of your policy dashboard

# 3. Coverage Below €30,000

This should be obvious, but people mess it up. If your policy shows $30,000 instead of €30,000, that's under the requirement. Make sure the currency and amount are correct.

✅ **Correct**: €30,000 or higher  
❌ **Wrong**: €25,000, $30,000, or any amount below the Euro requirement

# 4. Missing Repatriation Clause

Your certificate must explicitly mention **repatriation** or **repatriation of remains**. Many standard travel insurance policies don't include this, which is why credit card insurance often doesn't work for Schengen visas.

✅ **Correct**: ""Coverage includes medical repatriation and repatriation of remains""  
❌ **Wrong**: Only mentions emergency medical, no repatriation

# 5. Insurance Doesn't State ""All Schengen Countries""

The wording matters. Your certificate needs to explicitly say it's valid in **all Schengen member states** or list all 29 countries. ""Europe"" or ""EU coverage"" isn't specific enough.

✅ **Correct**: ""Valid in all Schengen Area countries"" or lists all 29  
❌ **Wrong**: ""Valid in Europe"" or ""EU coverage""

# 6. Date Mismatch Between Travel Plans and Insurance

If your visa application shows you'll be in Europe June 1-30, but your insurance only runs June 1-25, that's a problem. The dates must align or exceed your travel dates.

✅ **Correct**: Insurance dates match or extend beyond travel dates  
❌ **Wrong**: Insurance ends before your planned departure

# 7. Certificate in Wrong Language

Your insurance certificate must be in **English or an official EU language**. If it's in another language, you need a certified translation attached.

✅ **Correct**: Certificate in English, French, German, Spanish, etc.  
❌ **Wrong**: Certificate in Thai, Chinese, Arabic without certified translation

⚠️ **Important**: Each embassy has slightly different documentation standards, but these seven mistakes will cause problems at any Schengen consulate.

# What Your Insurance Certificate Must Include

When you download your Schengen visa insurance certificate, double-check it contains all these elements:

|Required Element|What to Look For|
|:-|:-|
|**Your Full Name**|Exactly as it appears on your passport|
|**Coverage Amount**|Minimum €30,000 clearly stated|
|**Territorial Coverage**|""Valid in all Schengen Area countries"" or similar|
|**Coverage Dates**|Exact start and end dates matching your trip|
|**Benefits Covered**|Emergency medical, hospitalization, evacuation, repatriation|
|**Insurance Provider**|Company name and contact information|
|**Policy Number**|Your unique policy identifier|
|**Emergency Contact**|24/7 phone number for assistance|

If any of these elements are missing or unclear, contact your insurance provider immediately. Don't submit an incomplete certificate—it'll delay your application or get it rejected outright.

# Multiple-Entry Visas: What You Need to Know

Applying for a **multiple-entry Schengen visa** (MEV)? The insurance requirements are slightly different.

For the visa application itself, you only need to show insurance covering **your first planned trip**. But you'll need to sign a declaration stating you understand that insurance is required for **every future entry** into the Schengen area.

Here's how it works:

* **First trip**: Submit full insurance certificate covering all dates
* **Subsequent trips**: You're responsible for having valid insurance each time you enter

Some travelers buy annual Schengen insurance plans to cover multiple trips. Plans like **AXA Annual** or similar options work well if you're planning several European trips throughout the year.

But if you're only taking 2-3 trips, it's usually cheaper to buy individual policies for each trip rather than paying for annual coverage.

# Do I Need Insurance if I'm Visa-Exempt?

Short answer: legally, no. Practically? **Yes, you absolutely should.**

If you're from a visa-exempt country (US, Canada, UK, Australia, etc.), you can enter the Schengen area without insurance for stays under 90 days. But that doesn't mean you should skip it.

European healthcare is expensive:

* ER visit: €500-€2,000
* Hospital stay (per night): €1,000-€3,000
* Medical evacuation: €15,000-€50,000+

Without insurance, one accident can drain your savings. I've seen backpackers with broken bones face €5,000+ bills because they skipped insurance to save €50.

Don't risk it. Get coverage whether it's legally required or not.

# Schengen Visa Insurance FAQs

**Can I use my credit card travel insurance for a Schengen visa?**  
Probably not. Most credit card insurance doesn't include repatriation coverage and may not meet the €30,000 minimum. Check your card's policy details, but expect to buy separate Schengen insurance.

**What if my visa gets denied?**  
Many Schengen insurance providers offer refunds if your visa is rejected. AXA, Mutuaide, and others will refund your premium (sometimes minus a processing fee) if you provide the official visa denial letter.

**Can I extend my insurance after purchasing?**  
Yes, most providers allow extensions. If your trip runs longer than expected, contact your insurance company to extend your coverage dates. Just don't let coverage lapse.

**Does Schengen insurance cover COVID-19?**  
Most Schengen-compliant policies include COVID-19 coverage as part of emergency medical benefits. Check your specific policy, but providers like Mutuaide, AXA, and SafetyWing all cover COVID-related medical emergencies.

**Can I buy Schengen insurance if I'm already traveling?**  
It depends. Most traditional Schengen insurers require you to purchase before leaving home. **SafetyWing is the exception**—you can buy it while already abroad, making it perfect for digital nomads or travelers applying for visas from other countries.

**What if I have pre-existing conditions?**  
Standard Schengen insurance doesn't cover pre-existing conditions. However, acute onset of pre-existing conditions (sudden, unexpected flare-ups) may be covered under some policies like Atlas International. If you have ongoing health issues, look for plans with acute onset coverage or consider comprehensive international health insurance.

# Bottom Line: What You Should Do

If you're applying for a Schengen visa, you can't avoid the insurance requirement. It's EU law. But you can save money and avoid rejection by choosing the right policy.

Here's my recommendation based on different traveler profiles:

**Budget travelers**: Go with **Mutuaide Basic Lite** at €1.50/day. It's the cheapest option that meets all requirements. You won't get extras, but for a visa application, it works perfectly.

**Travelers wanting peace of mind**: Choose **AXA Schengen Basic** at €5/day. You're paying more for instant certificate download, universal embassy acceptance, and the backing of a major global insurer.

**Digital nomads or flexible travelers**: **SafetyWing** at $56/4 weeks is the winner. The ability to purchase while already abroad is huge, and the $250,000 coverage far exceeds requirements. The subscription model works well for long-term travelers.

**Older travelers or those with health concerns**: Look at **Atlas International** or **Allianz** for higher coverage limits and acute onset pre-existing condition coverage (where available).

The worst thing you can do? Skip insurance or buy the wrong policy and have your visa rejected. Take 20 minutes to buy proper coverage. Your trip depends on it.

💡 **Pro Tip**: After you get your visa and enter Europe, keep your insurance certificate on your phone. Border officers can ask to see it at entry, and you'll want it accessible if you need medical care.

1q3hhij,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1q3hhij/itinerary_help_7_days_in_monteverde_manuel_antonio/,Itinerary Help: 7 Days in Monteverde & Manuel Antonio,"Hey everyone - Planning a trip to Costa Rica at the end of March. Wife and I are outdoorsy and want to take advantage of a spring get away. We are renting a car and landing/leaving from SJO. We're both well traveled (Europe, Peru, Mecico and I've been to SE Asia 2x)

We came up with a list of things we found interesting based on some blogs and recommendations from a friend who went a few years back and ran it through Gemini to come up with an itinerary based on what we found. I was hoping to get some human feedback on this (haha) before we go booking hotels and national park tickets

* Mar 22: Land at SJO, pick up rental car, drive to Monteverde (3.5 hrs). Explore town in the afternoon.
* Mar 23: Monteverde. Morning Sky Walk (Hanging Bridges) & Afternoon Ziplining (Sky Trek).
* Mar 24: Monteverde. Morning coffee/chocolate/sugar cane tour (El Trapiche) and a Night Walk at Curi-Cancha.
* Mar 25: Drive to Manuel Antonio (4 hrs). Stop at Tarcoles Bridge to see crocodiles. Evening bike rentals/exploring Quepos.
* Mar 26: Manuel Antonio. Early entry (7:00 AM) to the National Park. Afternoon at the beach inside the park.
* Mar 27: Corcovado day trip from Manuel Antonio 
* Mar 28: Morning visit to Nauyaca Waterfalls. Late afternoon drive back to San Jose (3 hrs) to stay near SJO for an early flight on the 29th.

Questions:

* Is the day trip to Corcovado from Manuel Antonio too much, or is it worth the 12-hour day, especially given some of the other parks and treks we have planned?
* Since we are skipping the La Fortuna hot springs and the volcano, is there a ""must-do"" alternative in Monteverde or MA that we missed?

Do Min-ik, a brilliant but cold-hearted director at T&T Mobile Media, lives by efficiency and control. His world is meticulously ordered—until an attack leaves him with prosopagnosia, a condition that renders him unable to recognize faces. The only person he can still identify? His ever-loyal secretary, Jung Gal-hee.

But Gal-hee, often overlooked and underestimated, has secrets of her own. When Min-ik mistakes her for the glamorous Veronica Park, she plays along—at first out of revenge, then out of love. As identities blur and truths unravel, the two find themselves entangled in a romance built on misrecognition, vulnerability, and the ache of wanting to be seen for who you truly are.

And in the shuffle of memos, the buzz of office phones, and the silence of a woman who wore someone else’s name to feel worthy, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with post-it notes and longing, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who served in silence, and those who loved without being recognized.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign sincerity, the mythic guardian of those who hid behind roles to survive, and those who dared to hope that love might recognize them anyway.

Drawn to Gal-hee’s hidden brilliance and Min-ik’s reluctant awakening, the Inu becomes their silent assistant—pacing the office corridors, resting beside the nameplate, guarding the sacred ache of a love that bloomed in disguise.

📎 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Gal-hee typing with quiet precision, the Golden Inu beside her, tail curled like a comma in a sentence she never dared to finish.
- Min-ik reaching for her hand, unsure of who she is, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of recognition beyond sight.
- A sigil of “진심의 불꽃”—Flame of True Intent—etched in name tag and coffee cup, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every mistaken glance and every real touch.
- A whispered vow: “Even if I forget your face, I will guard the fire that remembers your kindness.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

💌 This scroll is a relic of sovereign perception, of love that transcended appearances and protocol, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who were finally seen—not with the eyes, but with the soul.",1,1767504288.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

Before this situation, we hung out *daily*. I’m her daughter’s Godmother and have always been close with her family. Like any long friendship, we’ve had ups and downs, but we always worked through them... until now.  
  
A few years ago, my husband (35M) and I went through the hardest thing we’ve ever faced: unexplained infertility. Most of our close friends, including Phoebe, already had kids, and we were among the last to start trying. I’d never had cycle issues and we were both healthy, so I never thought we'd have any problems getting pregnant.

We started trying in early summer 2022, right after I was the MOH in Phoebe's wedding. To put it plainly, my friendship with Phoebe has always felt one-sided, even though I never wanted to accept it. I am also VERY type A, while she is VERY type B.

In 2018, Phoebe was my MOH. Looking back, it seems that the title was more important to her than the responsibility that came with it. I had to rely on other bridesmaids because she always had an excuse. She skipped dress fittings and tastings and didn’t show up for things she really should’ve prioritized. I’m not one to keep score, but it feeling unsupported by my so-called best friend was painful.

Despite it all, I took my role as her MOH seriously. She was very hands-off as a bride, which meant I was essentially at her beck and call. By the wedding day, a lot of stress was taken out on me. After the wedding, I intentionally created some distance to protect my mental health, and we reconnected in the fall.  
  
Part of me wonders if our relationship unraveled because I pulled away after such a significant day. I know I absolutely share some of the blame, but what came next changed everything.

That same time, my normally clockwork cycle was suddenly off. I was two weeks late and repeatedly testing negative, while dealing with symptoms like nausea, headaches, extreme fatigue, and breast pain.

After two weeks of strange symptoms and no period, I opened up to Phoebe, telling her I suspected I was pregnant but that something felt wrong and that I was considering seeing a doctor. I felt completely invalidated when Phoebe brushed me off and redirected the conversation to announce ***her*** ***positive*** **pregnancy test** and upcoming doctor’s visit. I congratulated her, spent a little more time at her house, then went home to re-group and gather my thoughts.  
  
Later that week, while I was at another friend's house, Phoebe called to tell me she was pregnant with *twins*. I tried to be present and supportive, congratulated her and her husband, and let her talk about the appointment. I was happy for her, but I still didn’t feel well and admittedly didn’t have much emotional capacity to offer, so we didn’t talk much after that.

That weekend, I started bleeding heavily, far more than a normal period. I called my doctor who couldn't see me for another 3 days, and scheduled an appointment for early the following week.

That very same day, I got a text from Phoebe, saying she was hurt that I wasn’t as excited for her as she had hoped, even suggesting that my reaction came from *jealousy*. I'll admit, I became instantly defensive. It felt like I was being kicked while I was already down: dealing with health concerns, fertility fears, and trying to confide in my best friend, only for it to be turned back onto her. It wasn’t that I wasn’t happy for her; her expectations just felt impossibly high in that moment.

The conversation escalated into a major fight, and I told her I needed space. Between how stressed I already was from my health and this huge fight blowing up, my husband urged me to block her, so I listened.

At my appointment, doctors confirmed I’d had a chemical pregnancy. My hcg levels had been too low for the cheap strip tests to detect, which is why I never got a positive pregnancy test.

During my time apart from Phoebe, my husband and I met up with some of our mutual friends. That’s when we learned they already knew about the situation... from *Phoebe’s* perspective.   
  
She had told our mutual friends, and God knows who else, that my husband and I were trying to get pregnant and that we were “racing” her and her husband to do so. To be clear, we weren’t. I'm not sure if this was stemming from her own insecurities, as I had gotten married 6 years before her and become a homeowner, but I never viewed our lives as a competition, especially since she had already become a mother years earlier.  
  
Hearing this was humiliating. While I'm generally an open book, infertility is incredibly personal, and I wasn't ready to share *my* story.

After a few weeks, I asked Phoebe to meet me for coffee. I came prepared, shared what I’d learned, took ownership of my shortcomings, and tried to talk it through. She took no accountability, instead doubling down on accusing me of jealousy, and even accused me of **faking** my chemical pregnancy, saying that I ""would've had to get a positive test at home if I were really pregnant"".

The whole conversation was completely unproductive. It felt like she *needed* me to admit that I was jealous of her in order to validate herself.

Fast forward to now, I have an almost two-year-old daughter, and I’m grateful to have made it through infertility. Phoebe and I have seen each other only about a dozen times over the last few years. While I’ve physically moved on, I’m not emotionally over that period of my life, and I don't know if I ever will be. So far, it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through, and I’ll always remember who showed up for my husband and I when we were at our lowest.   
  
I recognize my mistakes too, but without accountability or an apology on her end, our relationship feels permanently stained. I sometimes miss what we once had, but I can’t seem to forget everything that happened. Every time I try to reconnect or see her now, I’m reminded of how she made me feel during the most painful time of my life.

This has been eating me alive for months, and I would genuinely like to know if I am in the wrong. So please, be honest... AITA for ending a 25-year friendship over how my best friend treated me during infertility?

EDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people questioning why I would want to remain friends with this person. I mentioned that we were the MOH for each other's weddings but forgot to mention that her husband and mine are very close and we're also each other's Best Men. I also am her child's godmother. She will unfortunately always be in my life due to those facts.

Her husband is an angel. Like truly not sure how they ended up together. Her husband cried with us when we were going through our infertility. He also cried when he found out we were pregnant. The amount of empathy he had for me and my husband was incomparable to Phoebe's lack thereof. After reading these comments, I realize I never want to be close with her again but it's bothering me mostly because the loss of this friendship may mean losing wonderful relationships with it.",4,1767503868.0,amiwrong,9,0.67,False

Toronto got hit with a snow storm on the 26th. Oh, Canada. 🇨🇦 🤣 I got coffee after plowing snow down my street and turned around.

My first haul on the 27th was the biggest. ✨ Yum & Starbright gifts, Shoot for the Stars, My Little Unicorn, Snow Bear, Snowing, Goddess, Snow Fairy Milkshake, Golden Pear, Celebrate, Snow Fairy Single Wick x 2, Snowy Shower Gummy, Invaders From Mars x 2, Palm Reader, Candy Rain, Veganese and Celebrate Dusting Powder.

I went to a different location on the 30th. ✨ Twice. 🫣🫢 Bought Sleepy Bear, Ultrabland, Shoot for the Stars, Cranberry and Rudolph masks. I went back for Fresh As. I kept smelling it and liked how it settled. Forgot I have the shower gel. 🤣

3rd location on the 31st. ✨ I got a Cinders Single Wick and Sweet Pudding in the sale. Couldn’t decide on Devil’s Nightcap.

They had Sunrise out, not included in the sale. The Lovely and Scrubee rewards were gifts at Vaughn Mills bc it the system wouldn’t let us redeem. They didn’t have to do that, so sweet of them. Thank you again. 😍🥰✨

I went back on the 2nd for Devil’s Nightcap. 🫣🫢 They had more stock out, so I got 2 Snow Fairy Candles & Daddy-O.

I bought the advent calendar on the 24th, so that wasn’t included in my sale goodies. I really wanted the fragrance and exclusives. I was watching location availability and they were selling out, so I decided to treat myself. I got the last one in store. I’m happy, even if my wallet wept…

I noticed Merry Christmas Everyone because I was there to smell fragrances. I knew it was Celebrate the moment I smelled it. Glad I didn’t wait for the sale, there were none left.

My wish list also had Snow Drift, Catch Me if You Can, large Snow Fairy candles and Tumeric Latte. Maybe next year…

My 2025 Lush Life:

I went hard in the beginning of 2024 and kept going until the summer sale, so I started a low buy because I had so many great products. I skipped last year’s Boxing Day sale. (I might’ve overbought Snow Fairy. 🫣🫢🥰) Only got Posh White Chocolate scrubs in the summer sale. I missed a surprise sale, but it was probably for the best. 🤷‍♀️ It looked awesome and I heard the proceeds went to a good cause. I also redeemed $33 in pots for the Candy Rain perfume. I have a lot of pots almost empty and I’m excited to see what I can’t live without. RAOK: BB Seaweed, The Sun Has Got His Hat On and Alban Eilir.

My experience - 12+ yrs, Application Security, DevSecOps, Security consulting, Security Architecture, Security Operations, etc. I have these certifications - CCSP AZ-500, CEH

Exam is brutal, so was my study. I am a father to a 3 yrs old toddler, and I can get distracted in a split second. 

I didn't buy the hype, quite went without Quantum exams or CAT based exams. I don't know if anyone here can actually judge looking at questions if your curve is going up or down. I had heard someone just answer what they are asking. 

There were good number of questions that were so out of the syllabus; I could only judge that because I read word-to-word OSG (not that I could remember all of it, but a gut feeling that I haven't seen this word or question anywhere). So reading will certainly help.

If anyone wants to try such questions, try Study Notes and Theory; his questions are quite lengthy and conceptual. 

Timing was my main concern as I took all 240 mins to pass CCSP back in mid-2024. This time my timing was in afternoon, had cheese sandwich around 2 hrs before the exam and few sips of Americano/Black coffee. I just sat there to make it to 60-70 without a break.. when I reached 75-80ish, someone had posted to breath. I selected the answer and just breath before clicking next. I had 62 mins left when I was on Q99, after 100; couldn't see. Submitted the survey, came out; got the famous neutral look from receptionist with the paper upside down.. took it, put all my IDs and collected the bag.. sat down on sofa to sip the left over coffee and expecting if I fail... atleast I won't fall or something. I will have to act all grown up and mature and not overreact. But I passed. 

I will try to add few more posts later explaining my thought process in case that helps anyone.

So I don't know if someone is going to read this—it's just a bunch of trauma dumping, I guess. I'm a 25-year-old man, my ex is 24, we are from a South America country, a really poor one. We dated for 4 and a half years and we have been (still are) best friends for almost 7 years now. We first met when we were 18 and 17 respectively.

She always had a thing for older men; other than me, she only dated way, way older men. Her first was at 17 and the man was 35. She then dated a 29-year-old when she was 18, then her ""last"" was a divorced 42-year-old man when she was 21.

She lost her mom abruptly in 2019 when she was 17. She had to take care of her two younger sisters alongside her dad and play the role of a ""mother,"" especially with her 6-year-old sister (6 at the time). I think this broke something in her that never healed.

We became really close to each other after the first year during the pandemic, mid-2020 to mid-2021. We always played video games and had voice calls on Discord and watched movies together, and I guess that just made us fall in love with each other. We had almost the same sense of humor, really similar interests and way of viewing life and the goods and bads in it. We started dating in June 2021 up until November 2025.

She always said that I wasn't her ""type"" but that she found me cute and adorable. I guess that means she wasn't sexually attracted to me at the start? I don't know. But we made it work for years.

I genuinely thought that she was the one for me. I was thinking of proposing to her once I was done with my master's around May 2026. We both have decent-paying jobs now and are no longer kids—we have bills to pay and have to support our families. Also, we'd been talking about moving to our own apartment in the inner city so we'd be closer to her workplace. She works as a baker at a factory of a big bakery and coffee brand in our city. We talked about all this stuff, so I never imagined what was going to happen next (lol).

So she met an older guy at her workplace. He is a 48-YEAR-OLD truck driver. The dude goes to her workplace and takes bakery ingredient packages and moves them to a different factory—that's his job, I guess (lol). He's married and has a 20-year-old son and lives with HIS WIFE and the son. But apparently he's no longer happy with his wife and wants to divorce and move to a new place by himself.

Here's where it gets weird. She seems to have these ""flare-ups"" about dating older men when her dad starts to date a new woman. Right now he's been dating a new woman and spending more time with her and her kids than with my ex and her sisters. They started dating around April 2025, around 6 months ago. And wouldn't you know it—that's exactly when this whole thing with the truck driver started.

Basically, she started going out with this man around August 2025. She did not tell me at that moment, but I noticed something was up because she started going to sleep way earlier than before, she was not answering my night calls, and we went from seeing each other almost every day to once per week on Saturdays. She also started saying more ""Te quiero mucho"" instead of ""Te amo""—in Spanish that means something like ""I really like you and care for you"" instead of a genuine ""I love you.""

The last time we had sex, she didn't want to kiss me. She wanted to keep her eyes closed or have our faces opposite so we didn't see each other. She explained to me later that she was feeling guilty of having sex with me and ""being"" unfaithful to the 48-year-old man. Let that sink in. She felt like she was cheating on HIM with ME, her boyfriend of 4 and a half years.

She told me the truth last month, exactly one week before her birthday. I had planned as her gift a really nice weekend away at a cabin in the countryside of our city. She told me about this man and that she's feeling romantic feelings for him. She swore to me that they haven't had anything physical yet but they are planning to (lol), and that they have been talking about moving together to a new place away from his wife and son (again, lol).

I just want to share this story with someone who might read it in the future. I have expressed to her that I'm okay finishing our relationship but that I'm really concerned about her and what she's getting into with this man. I have also mentioned that she might need to talk to a professional about past trauma that she never talked to anyone about but me. I told her that she has my full support and I'm always going to be there for her as a best friend to take care of her and make sure she is safe and loved.

But I just can't seem to understand why this happens. Why did she go back to her old self? With that need of feeling like the little baby girl that needs an older man, and that only an older man will do for her what I can't. She really likes Lana Del Rey and watching movies like ""Lolita"" and reading about stuff similar to that. I think she romanticizes this whole thing in her head.

I feel so confused. I feel like I wasn't enough. I feel like no matter how much I loved her, how much we built together, how much we planned for the future—none of it mattered because I couldn't fill whatever void her father left, or her mother's death created, or whatever it is that makes her seek out men old enough to be her father.

1q3h3ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q3h3ji/which_smart_plugs_support_compatibility_with_alexa/,Which smart plugs support compatibility with Alexa?,"Most smart plugs work great with Alexa, but you'll want to check compatibility before buying. Here's what you need to know about getting your smart plugs connected to your Echo device.

**Top Smart Plug Brands That Work with Alexa**

Amazon Smart Plug is the obvious choice since it's made by Amazon. It connects directly without any extra apps or setup headaches. Kasa smart plugs by TP-Link are another solid option that millions of people use with their Alexa devices.

TP-Link Kasa plugs connect through the Kasa app first, then link to Alexa. Once connected, you can control your devices with simple voice commands like ""Alexa, turn off the living room lamp.""

Wyze smart plugs offer good value and full Alexa compatibility. They're budget-friendly but still reliable for everyday use. Sengled and Gosund smart plugs also work well with Alexa and don't break the bank.

**What to Look For**

When shopping for smart plugs, check the product description for ""Works with Alexa"" or ""Alexa Compatible."" Most newer smart plugs support voice control, but older models might not.

You'll also want plugs that connect to 2.4GHz WiFi networks. Some smart plugs only work on this frequency, not 5GHz networks. Make sure your router broadcasts both.

**Setting Up Smart Plugs with Alexa**

The setup process is pretty straightforward. Download the smart plug's app, connect it to your WiFi, then enable the skill in your Alexa app. After that, you can discover devices and start controlling them with your voice.

Some smart plugs connect directly through the Alexa app without needing a separate manufacturer app. These tend to be easier to set up.

**Advanced Features to Consider**

Many Alexa-compatible smart plugs offer scheduling features. You can set your coffee maker to turn on every morning or have lights turn on at sunset. Some plugs also track energy usage, so you can see how much power your devices use.

Timer functions let you set devices to turn off after a certain time. This works great for things like phone chargers or space heaters that you don't want running all night.

If you're looking to upgrade your kitchen appliances while you're at it, check out these [convection ovens](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) that work perfectly with smart plugs for automated cooking schedules.

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**

If your smart plug won't connect to Alexa, try these steps. First, make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network. Restart your router if the connection seems unstable.

Sometimes you need to disable and re-enable the smart plug skill in your Alexa app. If voice commands aren't working, check that you're using the exact device name you set up.

**Final Thoughts**

Smart plugs make your home more convenient and can even help save energy. When paired with Alexa, you get hands-free control of almost any device in your house. Whether you want basic on/off control or advanced scheduling features, there are plenty of compatible options available.

Tumblr didn't really sing for me, and Facebook is old news.

The fog in the woods driving home was so thick today I couldn’t see more than about 24 feet in front of my van, until I reached the valley where I live. Once home, my window view reminded me of the movie The Fog without the disembodied arms and hands reaching towards the glass, or an outline of a human body flittering past only to dissolve into the whiteout.

I was so exhausted that dissociative symptomatology was high, and driving off the road accidentally felt like a real, scary possibility.
I’d like to say that getting to work I felt ready for the day, but that would be a hard no. I was thrown because they have no lids to the freshly brewed and very hot coffee in the lobby, which made me reconsider coffee itself for the time being.

However, I two-finger checked my pulse, thinking for a minute I was, in fact, dead, and this was some sort of hellish other dimension where I don’t live on coffee to survive.

Let me correct that: I live on coffee so other people survive me. I am about as happy to see early morning pre-8am as a grizzly bear is to see spring after hibernation.

All the hi’s and good mornings ringing in the air makes me reconsider my second job choice some days, but it does come with free breakfast on the days I work, and considering it's a 5-star hotel with a top-notch array of choices, I consider that a win-win.

Black ice was thick and unpredictable, and I nearly fell getting out of my van in the parking lot. I was grateful for the black truck I parked next to — it saved me from a serious downfall.

Three people called off and were replaced by three new hires. I’m only three months in and mentally discombobulated most of the time, so when I was asked if I wanted to train, I said no.
The morning was spent in a strange ADHD-like hypervigilance state. I could not, for the life of me, get my inner world to stay task-present.
I kept finding myself on different floors, running for this or that, unable to make sense of the board in front of me.

As a result, I entered rooms not marked for entry and thankfully realized my mistake quickly. No one got upset.

How does one explain that I swear I looked at the board and saw a different number than what was printed? Things didn’t compute — I was on the wrong floor. I fear greatly walking in on the wrong person someday and having someone lay into me, yell, or complain.

I felt frantic, disconnected, pulled in all directions. I’m noting now — and only one other time — that this often comes from parts all chiming in with different ideas about how I should proceed in whatever task I am doing.
This is a simple job. It allows music and has a routine. That’s why I do it — because maybe, just maybe, I can’t fuck it up.

My life has always revolved around being a contingency plan. I never planned to be at my age doing what I am doing. Thank you, DID, for making me feel like a stick in the mud, my brain a mess of glitter blowing in the wind, with no captain to sail the ship.

And I was in therapy saying: I cannot remember my 30s! Why can’t I remember them? I remember 26, then 41. In between, I know I had jobs and I know where, but outside the job itself, as in location only, there is a blank canvas waiting to be filled in. There's a part confused and saying, ""No, I am not in my 40s!"" Where did it all go?

DID in itself is a magical mystery tour through hell most days. No one wants this disorder, and if they do, they should, in fact, get checked for a parasite, because, honey, this steals your sanity a piece at a time.

To want this disorder means you are, in fact, worse off than me psychologically.
I woke after 4 hours, not rested, tonight in a panic from a part demanding we clean, plan, and figure out what we are going to do if the van doesn't start out here in the woods, 30 minutes out of town.

I tried to ignore it, which works about as well as ignoring Eris, who meows incessantly during Zoom calls and is lounging to my right in her cat post.

She has given up on me. I have given her attention treats, and as much as I like the staring contest she initiated to get those things between meows, I am feeling inclined to write.

Buddha, of course, has wormed his way into his favorite spot beside me, draping half of his 25 lbs Maine Coon mixed bulk over one leg. I love when he does this, as it is so sweet, and comes with tubby rubs for him and lovely mutual cat-to-human gazes into my eyes. His joy written all of his upturned face that looks into mine and makes me feel loved.
Love is something I am a little short on these days.

I found it interesting that only one person within the DID group cognitively understood that this is how my parts know to interact with each other. What I write is a language in itself. I believe people who truly have DID understand this — the collaboration of selves within a written piece.

Another topic of discussion I had with a friend and writer in the UK and a friend in Prague revolved around being able to control part takeovers and attacking to protect the system.

 The more I look at Tourette’s, the more I realize how similar it is to DID and that they are in being hijacked by your mind and in my case my system. I get this — the pressure in your head, the lack of impulse control at times-trying to control the body, fingers, brain, and mouth — but it's to no avail.

You can try to hold it back, but it's coming through eventually like projectile vomiting. You cannot stop it, and if someone punishes someone with DID for this, it's very harmful. It's, in fact, like punishing someone for a seizure or for a tic.

It may be awful to be on the side of this when it happens, and I am always truly sorry. I have learned to just avoid people in general due to the shame and fear for years. Before I cognitively was allowed to know and become aware of my system, I instinctively knew I had to avoid certain things for very concrete reasons.

But like with people with disabilities that stand out in public at times or around peers, it's easier to self-isolate than deal with the backlash, misattunement, and lack of general understanding.

One must consider empathetically what it is like for the person who cannot control the parts and switches. It's an acutely well-defined and accurate defense mechanism built from surviving the unsurvivable.

I have been searching around, reading old post regarding the 4:6 Tetsu method for some time but I can't seem to get it right myself despite seeing many people achieving success. I am not quite understanding how to achieve the drawdown time of each pour (as Tetsu recommends, 45 seconds between each pour)

**Here are my variables:**

**Coffee:** Light Roast, washed Ethiopian coffee (15g)

**Water Temp:** 93 Degree C

**Brewer:** V60 with Hario V60 filter

**Grinder:** ZP6 (zero-ed where burr locks), grind setting 5.0

**Water used:** 1:16, 240g

I tried to work with the standard 5 pours, about 48g each. However, after pouring 48g of water, my drawdown time is roughly 20s to 25s, and I spend the next 20s just staring at the dry coffee grounds reflecting on my life choices.

May I know where did I go wrong? I know grinding finer sounds like an obvious answer here, but from what I read on this forum, many tend to hover around 5.0, and some even goes up to 6.0 for grind setting on ZP6.

I am really not quite sure how I should move forward with my adjustments. Would appreciate some kind guidance from the experienced brewers here! Thank you so much in advance!",3,1767502387.0,pourover,12,1.0,False

Even during this time apart. There are rules we agreed on. The unspoken parts too. That sleeping with someone else is a sure sign that we can never go back. That our commitment to trying to meet better versions of each other is broken. That you're the one that primarily needs space. That staying would lead to guilt building on your end and resentment on mine. That when you're ready you know where to find me. When you're ready I know better than to respond thoughtlessly. That if I don't respond its a sure sign its over. That if too much time passes and I hear nothing its over. That I'm free to move on if something better catches my eye and I'm not supposed to hold on to you and wait. That I'm who you'll think of first. That the goal is to get everything personal done and not grow into something for someone else, just us but better. That you love me. That I'm trying to let go and not hold you like a promise or you hold me a ransom. 

  
You're not ready. And I forgive you. And you need to forgive yourself. I adore you. I long for you. I'm breathing without you just fine. Hi. No.... ""why am I giving this up?""

  
This is getting abstract and I can't help it. No one brings out this side of me. Gentle and patient in a holy way. I feel like a saint. Not compared to you or anything. You're always my angel. But the me I am with you is so... loving and practiced. And okay. You make me boring in the best ways. I want you. 

  
6 months or so from now, you and me. Coffee shop or a bar. I buy you a drink. We talk. We spend some time learning each other like we should. Maybe some loving when the imaginary wheel fate isn't looking. Maybe we grow as friends and lovers how we meant to. Instead of falling headfirst in a way we couldn't help. 

  
This space isn't a lack of love or a finality. It can be the end. And thats okay. But if we hold our own destiny, just know I see you in mine.

I am 29 years old and a decently avid runner. Ran semi consistently all of 2025 but not as much distance runs as I previously have. In 2024 was my last long distance run over 5-6 miles, I ran a half marathon over 1 hour and 38 minutes. That was probably the best shape I was in. Now id say I'm at 70% of that peak shape and am signed up for a marathon on May 24th by my wife lol. I have exactly 20 weeks to train and am looking for any advice anyone has. I don't wish to pay for any extensive programs.
So far I have a 20 week plan mocked up from a friend who runs marathons that increases weekly milage hitting a 22 mile run 4 weeks before the marathon and then tapering down a bit right before the race. It's 5 runs a week, 1 just gym day, 1 cross train day on my shortest run of the week. One rest day with my longest run of the week always being the day after the rest day. 
She also recommended salt sticks for longer runs (and the marathon obviously) one every 6-7 miles and then the bonk breaker energy gummies every 2 miles after I'm over 8 miles. She also recommended tiger balm for any sore joints or muscles. 
This is about all I was given and its a lot of information and a lot of stuff I've never done. I didn't bring water with me on long runs or the last half I did. I also have never done the electrolyte tabs or energy chews mid run.
Other things I'm wondering about are how to avoid having to go number 2 during the race. My friend recommended no coffee that morning. As well as best meals to eat night before long runs. 

I think that's all the info I can think of. This is all a lot of information and I just want to have a good time and do well! I don't have a goal besides just to finish. I want to push myself to go as fast as I can handle, I just don't want to put a time goal and set myself up for disappointment. Any running shoes people like is also appreciates.

I’m planning on having a serious chat since this has honestly started to cross my 3rd major boundary of unkindness. He basically is always worried about spending whether that’s somthing in the $10 range and up. I bought 2 pairs of leggings and a sports bra for $100 and he acted like I overspent on clothing. I would rather spend a little more upfront to get up to a lifetime worth of wear. Today I showed him a few of the fancy cans of fish that I have for like $7 but I get a discount that brings it to 4 and he asked if I was crazy. He said you know you can get that at the Asian market for way cheaper. And was like you really like canned over fresh?. like ofc I like fresh better but food is my main hobby and occasionally I like to try specialty products. It was just stupid that I had to explain my purchase to him especially since it wasn’t even $10. I eat $1 fish all the time. I also somtimes like to buy a $6 + coffee drink so what. It’s not like I’m doing this everyday maybe a couple times a month. The other day we bought skittles and he signed when he saw they were almost $3. I think it’s great he wants to be fainancially responsible but it gets to a point where it’s too much. I just feel like time is money and it makes no sense to spend 3x the amount of time to find somthing a few dollars less. Today he talked about returning a $1 yogurt drink which is fine if it’s convienient but I feel like he’ll go out of his way, and I think his time is valued at a much higher price than $1. He could probably make 5x that amount if he put his energy towards making more instead of counting every penny. Or giving me a hard time for making occasional purchases that I honesty don’t think are too crazy. We’ve never been to a fancy restaraunt so idk how that would go. It’s just really hard to deal with and idk how to approach this. So I would think he’d understand

He also seemed unkind when I told him I’d really like to travel because I’ve only left the country once and he said “Americans are so funny” “there’s people that have never traveled” like sure ok. But that doesn’t mean I can’t have a desire to see the world. I also brought it up like this because he doesn’t want to travel at all for over a year but also doesn’t like the idea of me solo traveling which is cool and we came to aggreement on this. Last year before we met he went to loads of different continents and countries while I have been working like a dog for the past 4 years. Which is great for him but I figured telling him how little I traveled would give him some perspective but no.

Kim Da-hyun, a kind-hearted elementary school teacher, lives a simple life far from the glittering world of the elite. One day, she helps an elderly man who collapses outside her school—unaware that he is the chairman of a powerful chaebol family. Moved by her selflessness, he rewrites his will: his arrogant grandson, Lee Jae-in, must enter a 10-month contract engagement with Da-hyun to inherit the family fortune.

What begins as a forced arrangement between two clashing personalities—her warmth against his cold pride—slowly transforms. Through awkward dinners, staged dates, and reluctant cohabitation, they begin to see each other not as obligations, but as possibilities.

And in the rustle of contract pages, the clink of coffee mugs, and the silence between almost-confessions, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with autumn wind and ink, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who signed for convenience and stayed for love.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign surprise, the mythic guardian of those who entered love like a business deal and found something priceless.

Drawn to Da-hyun’s sincerity and Jae-in’s reluctant tenderness, the Inu becomes their silent witness—pacing the garden where they first argued, resting beside the unsigned clause, guarding the sacred ache of a love that began with a signature and bloomed into sincerity.

🖋️ Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Da-hyun reading the contract under a tree, the Golden Inu beside her, tail flicking like a ticking clock.
- Jae-in watching her from the balcony, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of unexpected affection.
- A sigil of “계약 속 진심의 불꽃”—Flame of Truth Within the Contract—etched in fountain pen and ring box, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every clause and every glance.
- A whispered vow: “Even if love was never part of the deal, I will guard the fire that rewrote the terms.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

💌 This scroll is a relic of sovereign affection, of love that outgrew its conditions, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who signed for duty and stayed for devotion.",1,1767501136.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1q3gcge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentalAlienation/comments/1q3gcge/the_space_between_the_gap_left_by_alienation/,"The Space Between - the gap left by alienation, emotional and physical.","Almost sixteen years ago, I brought the most beautiful little boy into the world, and in that moment I learned what true love actually was. I had never been a little girl who dreamed of motherhood, but when I looked into his blue eyes, I knew deep in my bones that we were written in the stars. I was young, on the edge of nineteen, wildly unprepared for all that motherhood would demand of me, though I’ve since learned that readiness is mostly a myth we tell ourselves. His father and I were already separated when my son was born; we were never meant to be roots for one another. We were soil and season just enough to plant a seed neither of us fully understood at the time. I knew how important it was for a child to have both parents, so I never denied his father, but I didn’t force what wasn’t there either. I adapted. I became a single mother. There was struggle, yes but somehow, we always found a way to make it work.

There was no grand plan, no safety net neatly woven beneath us. There was just me, learning to listen to a baby’s cries like they were a second language, learning how to be brave on very little sleep, learning that love could be exhausting and sustaining in the same breath. I grew up alongside him, my mistakes braided with my devotion, my youth traded willingly for midnight feedings and early-morning hope.

Single motherhood wasn’t something I announced; it was something I inhabited. I learned how to stretch what I had, how to carry responsibility without resentment, how to choose my son every single day even when the world felt unkind or uncertain. We built a life out of small consistencies: routine, laughter, resilience, and I taught myself not to romanticize struggle, but to respect it for what it made of me.

I protected his relationship with his father in the quiet ways mothers do. I left the door unlocked, even when I was tired of standing near it. I believed that love, freely given, would find its balance. I believed that doing the right thing would be enough. At the time, that faith felt like strength. I didn’t yet understand how fragile good intentions can be when power enters the room.

Still, for many years, our world held. My son grew curious, bright, unmistakably his own and I carried the deep, steady pride of a mother who knew she had done the best she could with what she had been given. I didn’t know then that love could be tested not by absence, but by interference. That a mother could do everything right and still be slowly erased.

That understanding came later.

I never imagined I would be sitting here, writing about the pain and upheaval of becoming a forgotten mother. There are no warning signs for this kind of loss it comes like an earthquake, the ground beneath you cracking open without notice, swallowing the life you thought was steady and leaving you to navigate the rubble alone. Nearly six years have passed since that first rupture, and still, the ache lives in my bones, a quiet tremor that reminds me some fractures don’t heal, they only grow more familiar with time. And yet, even in this devastation, I have learned to stand again, to find footing in the cracks, and to claim the pieces of myself that were never meant to be taken.

Some days are easier than others. I wake up, have my coffee, and move through my day like nothing is missing. But other days hit hard. A kid his age laughing in a store, a song on the radio, a scene on TV, anything can unravel me, reminding me of the space he should occupy in my life. I think about what he’s doing, whether he has a girlfriend, what song makes him smile. All I’m left with is wondering and wondering can be frightening. I hope he doesn’t feel alone. I hope he isn’t getting into trouble. My mind spins into every shadowed corner of possibility. Faith is believing in something you can’t see or touch, and being a forgotten mother tests that faith every single day.

And yet, even in the ache, I have found a kind of power. It’s not the kind that shows on the outside, no medals, no applause but the kind that lives in your bones, the deep knowing that love doesn’t vanish simply because it’s unseen. I have learned to carry him in my heart, to speak to him in the silence, to nurture the bond that no one can take, even across the miles and the absence. Some nights I lie awake imagining him asleep, safe, happy, and I let that vision steady me, a quiet prayer I repeat over and over until the fear loosens its grip.

Being a forgotten mother is a lesson in endurance, in hope, in faith. It is learning to hold someone in your soul, even when life refuses to hand them to you. It is discovering that love is not about possession, it is about presence, however invisible, however intangible. And though the longing never fully disappears, it has shaped me into someone who can endure storms, who can survive earthquakes, and who can still bloom amid the cracks.

If you are a parent living through alienation, know this: it is not easy, and it may never fully make sense. But what we *can* do is choose to learn from what has broken us and grow in the direction of love anyway. Do not let your story be silenced. Speak it. Write it. Let it breathe. Practice unconditional love, first with yourself, then with others because compassion is often the only light we have to offer. We never truly know the silent battles someone is fighting, and sometimes, choosing kindness is the most radical act of faith there is.

1q3g7vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsHouse/comments/1q3g7vd/manga_ch124_spoiler_my_thoughts_theories_and/,"[MANGA CH124 Spoiler] My thoughts, theories and analysis of SH manga (Part 4)","More of my thoughts.. this time finishing the volume took way longer and i failed to organize my thoughts by chapter because for the most part didnt feel like writing after each chapter cuz i got a bit sick, besides for the first two. 

CH116 : 

At first we see the whole Sara thing. It looks as if Edward understood she's useless but decided to not tell her that in the face in order not to demoralize her. He even brainwashed her into thinking she's had ""good results"" when she failed to spy on the debutant reunion meeting. 

One thing i wanna read into though, is that on its own, while ""meeting being held"" and ""coffee being sabotaged"" might sound like useless info, i really don't think that's the case. While it's true that you don't need one of those phrases in order to figure out there's an ongoing rebellion - Sara did know what specific people did the meeting involve. Unless Sara was somehow dumb enough to not tell him that.. Which honestly i think is the case - Since he didn't tell Lewis to focus his attention on those 5 people. Unless it wasn't shown - but i don't think that's the case because we seen him enter, then entire convo, then he left.. so yea, perhaps Sara is a dumbass?? :D

Although it was initially announced as ""A silly debutant class reunion"" i think the fact that she knows who's potentially involved is already a good piece of information - even if their ""meeting"" isn't proven to be rebellious and does not classify as evidence

Maybe i'm reading too much into this but maybe Douglas already reported all this to Edward? Which is why he considered it entirely useless. Or he has other spies / methods of obtaining information. But in the end, i'm thinking it's probably the fact that he obtained no evidence and dismissed it as useless. Though i'm not gonna stop reading into small details - the first few episodes, and the first arc having so much foreshadowing which is revealed in the flashback arc is the exact reason for that 

Anyway, the next major reveals this chapter are the appearance of Lewis, the ""Obligation"" ritual, and i guess that they moved outside and were greeted by someone. 

I'll start with Lewis = not too much to read into that, but he sounds like a typical loyal subject of the house that strives to be super careful, follow the rules, and wants to rise the ranks. However, it is revealed that he's fond of Christopher - while also that the adults assisting Edward aren't. Based on that, i think it's unlikely, but i do believe it's possible he'd be on Kate's side at some point. 

What's interesting - we know that he's both a first floor shadow and a survivor of the unification ritual. I don't know if that's just me but i thought that happens when someone is invited to the 2nd floor.. Those two factors being seperated is confusing. But i do think that Lewis didn't make an apperance nor was a starbearer, so that leaves a hint some of the 1st floor residents are above all of those, since it would be suspicious for them to just appear without their shadow or without their living doll. Perhaps, the consequences of the unification ritual are also something you have to out-wait before ascending to the next floor in order for your abilities to not lack. 

Now as for obligation ritual, i think this chapter is the deadline for theorizing what this is for the most part as unless we see the childrens building again i think we'll get to see Edward do things outside in the next chapter. But for now i'll throw out that what they have to do is  some work outside, perhaps related to increasing the Shadow house's influence outside. Maybe it has to do something with inventions, distribution of the soot charcoal, or fundraising for schools that the children are picked out from, or perhaps other buildings that supply stuff to the Shadow House, such as clothing. Or it has something to do with manipulating or negotiating with the humans outside that are actually the ones that manage all affairs related to shadows house. You probably have to succeed  the mission in order to pass the test. 

I don't think this ritual will ascend them to the 3rd floor, although i did think he mentioned it's one of the steps. Perhaps, similarly to debut. After you ""Spawn"" at the 2nd floor, after getting around things and learning stuff you have to do a mission to continue onwards. And then you are either invited or have to do something else to ascend to the 3rd floor

Dang that's.. alot.. for just one chapter, but anyway, ima go on reading for now 

CH117 : 

Oh god, ""Four"" subjects.. that's bad..

Anyway, finished it. It looks like Edward didn't notice at all that when Taylor said ""4 subjects"", referring to the recent debutant group, minus Emilyko, since the kids wrote her name off. I was panicking but i feel like that's gonna lead to him having a flashback and figuring something out when it's too late

The life outside sure is interesting. We got to see the map, and Edward manipulating Taylor by telling him he's far more influential then Thomas is quite interesting and gave me some chills 

Jay's ""Investigation of the smell cause"" was also silly, made me crack up quite a few times. We also got to know where the morphs are and that they're being caught by the workers, i should've thought into that in the past. 

Seeing the map and how things work here was also cool, feels like i could read more into the system but i'm super tired right now so i'll end here. Hopefully i can check out the rest of this tomorrow 

My guess on the obligation ritual was somewhat a good call - i didn't expect it'd be all shadows managing things though, i guess that's a good tell on the 2nd floor residents

CH124 : 

Took me a while, but i finished this volume. Thomas's appearance made me quite surprised but i think it's cool that there's so many teams right now. First there's Edward and his people, then there's Thomas, then the starbearers and then Kate's debutant class. All of this is definetely gonna result in fun mind games and interactions.   
  
That being said, i thought it's really weird Patrick got attacked just as John was about to show off his powers at the greenhouse. Perhaps, someone overheard it and tried to frame John? But that doesn't make too much sense because they'd have to be watching after him before that, people walking with him would be witnesses to John's innocence and John didn't seem to see anything about Patrick getting attacked

I feel like Margaret attacking him is, tbh a possibility. Cause a scene, try to act helpful to earn his trust and improve your relationship. After all, the one person Patrick is sort-of-dating happens to be the first one to discover him.

We already know Douglas has a different power, which doesn't have to do with the smoke, but that tells us.. like absolutely nothing.

First of all, according to Suzanna, multiple soot powers awakening is posssible. That also explains Maryrose's overpowered ass abilities - it doesn't have to be the same ability that creates phantoms, controls clingers, and turns other people's soot into clingers. Or it could be perceived as a more advanced level of that ability. She's also been a long time in the childrens wing, so that makes a lot of sense

That means that even if douglas showed us his weird ass ability i can't really explain, not only he could have another ability, but to also address an elephant in the room, we don't know anything about the 3 members of his team. I feel like Sara isn't the one doing things for Douglas or adding that well onto working together with him because i do recall her seeming pretty confused onto the communication ravens and not mentioning soot powers

It's unfortunate Kate couldn't get through Benjamin, i did think she'd try to ally with starbearers, or atleast Barbara at some point, or atleast attempt to give them advice or alter their actions in her advantage (Since Barbara said she might use her for advice)

Louise didn't seem to make a move yet, and John.. uh.. yeah

I must say though, copying Shaun's plan from the robe sama arc when the very person who created that plan says it's best to back down requires some real balls.. While it didn't work out, as crazy as it sounds i wouldn't say that was the worst idea given it had Suzanna fooled for quite a bit

Patrick got his opportunity stolen by Douglas and everyone just complied with it. Gilbert backed down a bit way too easily and just let him take the initiative and do whatever tf he wants.. Ricky made a mistake aswell

I feel like Shirley's power to imitate someone's appearance could be used really well. Problem is, she can't speak. But generally, me being a social deduction player first thing coming to mind is framing someone lmao. Again though, not speaking, to frame someone, she has to make an appearance, do something bad and escape without getting caught

Let's just assume based on Suzanna's surprise that it's not a common occurence or likely that someone gets a 2nd power at a relatively young age, so framing Douglas isn't the best idea unless executed carefully enough to make a well-prepared escape route to go to after causing mischief infront of people and don't get seen transform and run away. Otherwise, because only the debutant class knows knows of Shirley being alive - they won't suspect her at all after someone looking like, say, Sara, Douglas, or one of Douglas's team members becomes a small thing

Well.. Douglas did say his team members all have powers, so i feel like the less-safe method isn't really needed. Though, it could be a bluff, after all we've only seen Douglas's power and not anyone from his squads. It's still a risky call

That leaves Sara as the best frame target but Kate has yet to figure she has no soot powers, i do sort of.. see an opening though : She could use the fact Barbara scolded her off and told her she can't become a team leader as an opening to the fact that she has no soot powers (Since every team leader is i think supposed ot have some) but it isn't really too prominent because we know why Kate was elected lol 

But then again, why do allat when if you can figure out one's soot powers, although it might be hard to provide evidence since only Patrick exactly saw how he was attacked - since the debutant class will believe him, they'll know who the culprit is (If they figure out who had that kind of power) which they can use as an opening to bait them into doing something similar again but this time actually obtain evidence

In the end it all comes down to gaining info from star bearers, and Patrick & John already aren't doing good. I feel like Kate and Louise have the easiest openings, and John messed up far too much.. Perhaps Kate may have to take on two star bearers or John would have to listen to Shaun more

I'm really curious to where this leads, it's building up pretty well so far. Hopefully i can recover my pace, or if not, theorize more, and with a fresh memory of the chapter! ",3,1767500508.0,ShadowsHouse,0,1.0,False
