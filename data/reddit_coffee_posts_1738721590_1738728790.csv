There is a certain amount of artificial sweetener that we relate to being ""as sweet as"" a certain amount of sugar, for me it feels like two packs of sugar are equivalent to 8 drops of sweetener on my large coffee, so I tried using, for example, 2 drops (¬º) of the sweetener quantity with 1,5 pack (¬æ) of the sugar quantity, and vice versa, because I imagined it should feel more or less as sweet as using the full amount of either. However what I felt like was that their sweetness didn't add up, almost like the amount of one in the drink meant nothing in relation to the othe, like I could individually taste ¬º of one and ¬æ of the other individually, neither of them seeming to be sweet enough.

1ii1kvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ii1kvr/company_terminated_me_from_practicum_because_they/,Company terminated me from Practicum because they made a slippery slope fallacy out of an honest mistake.,"Full story and context:

I've been (or was) enrolling in an accounting program at a local business school. The reason why was because I believed the credentials I would receive after graduating would give me substantial leverage in getting a job in the industry. I've passed all my required courses, but the only thing in my way was my 140-hour Practicum, and that's when complications begin to arise. The first company I did Practicum with ghosted me after leaving home sick early, subsequently leading to my first withdrawal. The second company terminated me for arriving late too many times, but that was on me. The college's policy goes like this: If I were to get withdrawn three times, I won't be able to graduate and lose my chance of getting those credentials. So knowing this is my last chance to graduate, I got to do Practicum for a third company and tried my utmost to fulfill those hours and graduate.

But today, without thinking, I sent an email to everyone in the head office asking who's responsible for refilling the coffee dispenser in the lunchroom, and the supervisor called me out on it. You'd think that after acknowledging my mistake and agreeing not to do it again, it would be over right? Wrong. A minute after what was nothing more than an honest mistake, my supervisor told me I was being terminated, telling me that they think I'll eventually do the same thing with confidential company info and no longer trusts me. I don't know what part of ""It was an honest mistake"" and ""It won't happen again"" they didn't understand, but sending a short and simple email asking an innocent question to an entire department is tantamount to mass compromise apparently, because of the slippery slope fallacy these irrational people were pulling on me. The minuscule likelihood of me doing that shit knowing the consequences, my given situation with the college, and my moral compass, and ANY evidence (or none thereof) in my mistake and the email itself even REMOTELY suggesting that I would willingly do such a thing was never addressed, only that it's (technically) possible. And that's literally all that mattered to them regarding my unfair termination. And now that my employment with this company is history, so is my enrollment at the college, and now I'm back to where I started but with thousands of dollars in student debt, all over an honest mistake, in which the absolute worst-case scenario is no less than 2k employees nationwide being aware of an empty coffee maker in the head office's lunchroom. Unless a commercially sold Van Houtte coffee maker is considered confidential company property.

**TL;DR:** I was terminated because of the slippery slope fallacy over an honest mistake which wasn't even that big of a deal to begin with, and all that time and money spent on my education was for nothing.",1,1738728496.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Alright, so I know this might sound a little extra, but I genuinely feel some type of way. My (32F) husband (34M) is usually on point when it comes to remembering important dates‚Äîanniversaries, birthdays, even obscure holidays like National Donut Day. But this year, February came and this man did not say a single word about Black History Month. No ‚ÄúHappy Black History Month, babe,‚Äù no fun facts about historical figures, not even a half-hearted attempt to take me to a soul food restaurant. I let it slide at first, thinking maybe he just forgot, but then it got me thinking what about March‚Äîaka Black Future Month, Women‚Äôs History Month, AND International Women‚Äôs Day. I'm worried I'm going to find myself constantly uncelebrated, unappreciated, and sipping my coffee like a forgotten queen.

When I finally brought it up today, FOUR WHOLE DAYS LATE! he hit me with, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ you actually care about that?‚Äù EXCUSE ME?! Sir, I am a Black woman! That means February and March are essentially my personal holiday season. The worst part? He tried to recover by saying, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt see you as just a Black woman‚ÄîI see you as my wife.‚Äù Cute in theory, but in practice? Sir, I am BOTH at all times!

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am the head distiller at a spirits distillery called Storytellers Distillery. As part of a monthly subscription series called the hyperseasonal series, we release a brand new product for our subscribers each month. We only ever make a new months product once and so - we only produce 100 bottles per month for our subscribers. 

The next month in the series is month #42 - in the spirit of the douglas adams' Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, I want you please to produce a product for this month - entirely produced by you - from the recipe to the name to the suggested serve for it. This will take the form of a product profile.   
  
In the novel, civilisation asks its artificial intelligence 'what is the meaning of life?' and after a long time thinking about it - the ai responds, comically, with the answer 42. 

In a similar manner, I want you to take as long as you think is best to come up with a product that I can make on your behalf that fits the following conditions:  
1. it must be able to be produced in one calendar month  
2. it must draw on themes inspired by the douglas adams anecdote above.

\#41 Coffee Go Go.

\###abv###  
40%

\###type###  
Coffee Spirit

\###description/story###  
¬≠¬≠¬≠The concept behind *Coffee Go Go* is simple: we wanted to push the boundaries of dilution in spirits. Traditionally, water is used to adjust the strength of a spirit post-distillation‚Äîbut what if we explored other options? Most non-water diluents fall into two categories: syrups (sugar-extracted flavors) or juices. However, there are intriguing alternatives that sit closer to water, such as tea (a water extraction) and coconut water (a juice).

Our idea was to extract the flavors of coffee into a water-based solution, distill it for clarity, and then use it as a dilutant. Would this process yield a result different from infusing coffee directly into a spirit and distilling it? We‚Äôre not sure‚Äîbut we‚Äôre excited to find out!

\###recipe###  
Grind 8kg whole coffee beans and put into a 100L still with 90L of water. Distill out 80L of coffee distillate and blend with 70%abv to achieve bottle abv of 40%

\###description/story###  
Hey guess what's fun? taking something new you‚Äôve discovered and twisting it into what you‚Äôre passionate about!

That‚Äôs how Oh! Snap! came to be, our head distiller recently discovered the European trend of using the traditional English pea to give cocktails a robust, fresh, grassy and somewhat texturous quality.

It‚Äôs a bright and unique flavour that‚Äîwith just a touch of tonic‚Äîis sure to delight!

\###recipe###

hi, *sooooooooooooo* I wouldn't consider this a method but more of a fun exercise to collect your thoughts, shift your focus, better your SC & all sort of **high vibe** feelings ‚Äî whichhhhhh I like, I mean ***who doesn't like feeling good?***


so it goes like this; ***you'll have to write 10 things*** under these categories that I'll explain briefly ‚ÅÄ‚û∑

‚õß**Gratitude** ‚Üí write down **10 things** you're grateful for, *no matter how silly or small* this already puts you on a positive state, **since you're appreciative of things you have, you're automatically open to receive more.**

example:

1. ***I am grateful for my house***

2. ***I am grateful for coffee***

3. ***I am grateful for my cat***
...

‚õß**Self-Concept** ‚Üí write down **10 things** you love about yourself, *can be 5 for personality, 5 for body or simply sort it out as you prefer* ‚Äî I always encourage self concept because it puts **YOU** on a pedestal + self assurance helps you keep your desires.

example:

1. ***I love how intelligent I am***

2. ***I love my big eyes***

3. ***I love my height***
...

‚õß**Desires** ‚Üí write down **10 things** you're manifesting, *again, no matter how big or small*, you can make up affs as you go about each or just write a desire as it is.

example:

1. ***my desired person is in love with me***

2. ***I've passed my desired interview***

3. ***I will travel to Greece***
...

(I'm not gonna keep yapping about how future-present-past tenses don't matter as long as the affs feel natural to you, so write them as you wish please & thank u)

---

soooo I like to do this when bored & just wanting to sort my priorities out (In a way?)

>**I believe when you're expressing gratitude you're opening yourself to receive** 

*(wether you believe you're the operating source, or believe In external source such as god/universe)* it's gonna work anyway, doesn't matter.

>**followed up with self love, I always promote it because it makes you magnetic to your desires**

it's really helpful to acknowledge you have good qualities & remembering you're deserving of love, wealth & everything else.. so this will get you on that state of ***knowing your worth.***

>**your desires come next because your subconscious will treat them as just other 10 things you have**

since we focused on 20 we already SEE in 3D.

please understand this is **for fun,** I just do it often & feel good afterwards ‚Äî it's not related to any specific Law **so feel free to personalise it as you wish :)**

remember **you're the one holding power,** every method works THANKS to YOU & everything you seek seeks you √ó10 ‚Äî ***you wouldn't have a desire to begin with if you weren't meant to have it,*** so act like it.

It started with my morning coffee. I wanted to try a new recipe I found online, but of course, it had measurements. ‚Äú300ml of water‚Äù and ‚Äú15g of coffee.‚Äù How do people eyeball this stuff so easily? I ended up just guessing, and the coffee was too strong. Not the worst thing, but still, it was a small frustration to start the day.

Work was manageable until my boss sent me an email asking for a quick analysis of sales data. The spreadsheet looked simple‚Äîcolumns of numbers, percentages‚Äîbut my brain froze. It felt like trying to read a foreign language without a dictionary. I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to make sense of it before quietly asking a coworker for help. They were nice about it, but I hate feeling like I can‚Äôt pull my own weight.

During lunch, I went to a nearby cafe. The total came to ‚Çπ237, and I handed the cashier ‚Çπ250, hoping they‚Äôd give me the correct change without any issues. Thankfully, they did, but I can‚Äôt shake the anxiety that comes with these small interactions. Counting coins, understanding prices‚Äîit all feels like walking on a tightrope, and I‚Äôm always afraid I‚Äôll fall.

The highlight of the day was a friend‚Äôs birthday dinner. I had a great time, but splitting the bill reared its ugly head again. The total was divided by five people, and I could see everyone calculating in their heads while I stared blankly at the receipt. Someone asked, ‚ÄúAre we including the tip?‚Äù and I felt my brain short-circuit. I ended up giving extra again, just to avoid the math.

On my way home, I tried to unwind by listening to music, but my mind kept wandering. Why does something so simple for others feel so impossible for me? Numbers aren‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîthey‚Äôre walls I keep running into, over and over again.

I know dyscalculia doesn‚Äôt define me, but some days it feels like it does. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll try again. That‚Äôs all I can do.",2,1738727429.0,dyscalculiadiscussion,0,1.0,False

I (28F) have known my best friend (32M) for almost 10 years. He has had his ups and downs in life and our friendship has definitely had its ups and downs, and he has always come to me to vent, ask for advice, etc. We actually became friends because he went through a really hard time. We met through an old job neither of us work at anymore and he hated me when we first met. At that job, he was very disliked by our bosses (we were both paramedics) because he was a bit of a troublemaker and was friends with a shitty employee who ended up getting fired.

Eventually, there was another guy we worked with who my friend thought he was friends with but, my friend is very bad with boundaries and ended up being reported to our bosses for not leaving the other male employee alone (following him to his car when he wouldn't talk to him, blowing up his phone, etc.). This led to my friend being told he needed to resign or he'd be fired. his is where our friendship started.

We got close, and I developed feelings, which he didn't reciprocate. I did not respect his boundaries in this scenario and pushed him to tell me why he didn't like me because, in my eyes (I was 22-23 around this time and was very insecure), he treated me like a girlfriend (coming to visit me at work, bringing me coffee, always paying when we went out, blowing up my phone). He told me he didn't have feelings for me because I needed to lose weight (I'm a size 14). After this happened, I dropped everything and moved to Africa for two months and didn't have any phone service.
When I came back, he took me out to Starbucks and apologized. I gave him the gifts I bought him from Africa (I know, I know) and all was fine. Eventually, he became a cop and I switched jobs and him and his partner used to come visit me at work all the time when they were on duty because my assignment was in their district. He would bring me dinner, coffee, etc. but now it felt more like a sister less like a romantic thing.

Long story longer, I moved across the country to California for a job. I was sexually harassed and assaulted by my boss at this job only two months into my time there and I went to him for support and he blew me off for a hypochondriac issue he was dealing with (he thought he had cancer in his leg because one was more swollen than the other). I told him how hurt and angry I was that he wasn't there for me when I needed him and went NC for 10 months. I was home visiting family when I told him he could come talk if he wanted. We spent 8 hours together crying about what I went through and he apologized a bunch of times. 

Fast forward to NYE, I go home again for the holidays and him and I go out with his new work partner (a social worker for a mental health unit, he's still a cop). She and I are basically the same person and get along really well. We hit it off right away and we've been talking pretty much every other day since then. He had a crush on her and would say things to her like ""I think about you sitting on my face"", ""you have a nice ass, I look at it when you walk"", ""you should go off your birth control"", ""I like skinny blondes"", and other things similar. This made her extremely uncomfortable and she came to me about it. I talked to him, he got angry and said all he was doing was flirting with a girl he liked. I tried to explain to him that that's not flirting, it can be considered sexual harassment and he laughed and said no it's flirting. I tried to explain it to him from a women's perspective, and he ignored me. 

It's been about a month since this happened and he has now been reported by a third party for sexual harassment towards his partner. She came to me, worried about both of their jobs and asked me to warn him because she didn't want him to think she reported him. He found out before I could and called me about it. I told him what I knew (with permission from his partner) and he got angry again (he's very pushy and his mood can change quickly and he pops off). On the phone to me, he said things like ""this is immorally wrong"", ""this will ruin my life"", ""all I did was flirt with a girl I like"", etc. He also said that I ruined my abusers life by reporting him to our Title IX office. I told him the only person who ruined my abuser's life was my abuser when he decided to harass and assault his female employee (amongst the things he did in the 8 other complaints lodged against him that got him fired). My friend yelled at me and said objectively, I ruined my abuser's life. I hung up on him and about an hour later he called me and said I'm sorry and then continued to go on about the issue he was dealing with (which I understand, it is a lot to go through).

Anyway, sorry for the length. My question is, how do I go about being in the middle of this? He's mad that I still talk to her and I've tried to explain it's because I resonate with the position she's in and he keeps telling me I need to pick a side and I'm not trustworthy and have betrayed him for continuing to talk to her through this whole process. They have currently been moved to different office locations while this HR investigation is going on. I feel stuck in the middle. I want to be there for my friend of 10 years because he doesn't have many friends, but I also want to be there for my new friend (his partner, ex partner??) because I understand the position she's in and we get along so well and I don't want to ruin either friendship.

Are you dreaming of a brighter, more radiant smile? With multiple teeth whitening technologies available today, choosing the right treatment can feel overwhelming. Zoom teeth whitening and laser teeth whitening are two popular professional methods that promise stunning results, but they differ significantly in approach, effectiveness, and overall experience. Understanding the nuances between these treatments can help you make an informed decision about achieving your perfect smile. Whether you're battling stubborn stains from coffee, wine, or years of discoloration, this comprehensive guide will break down everything you need to know about zoom teeth whitening versus laser teeth whitening.

What is Zoom Teeth Whitening?

Zoom teeth whitening is a professional in-office bleaching procedure that has gained widespread popularity for its quick and effective results. Developed by Philips, this treatment uses a specialized hydrogen peroxide-based gel combined with a unique LED light activation system. The process typically takes about 45-60 minutes and can dramatically lighten teeth by several shades in a single session.

Key Features of Zoom Teeth Whitening:
- Advanced LED light technology
- Professional-grade whitening gel
- Immediate results
- Minimal sensitivity
- Supervised by dental professionals

How Zoom Whitening Works

The Zoom whitening procedure follows a systematic approach:
1. Dental professionals apply a protective barrier to gums
2. A hydrogen peroxide-based whitening gel is applied to teeth
3. A specialized blue LED light activates the gel
4. The light breaks down stain molecules
5. Multiple 15-minute cycles are completed during the treatment

Understanding Laser Teeth Whitening

Laser teeth whitening represents another professional whitening method that uses targeted laser energy to enhance the bleaching process. Unlike Zoom, this technique employs actual laser technology to accelerate the whitening chemical reaction.

Primary Characteristics of Laser Teeth Whitening:
- Precise laser energy application
- Higher intensity whitening
- Customizable treatment intensity
- Potentially faster results
- Advanced technological approach

Comparative Analysis: Zoom vs Laser Whitening

Effectiveness
Zoom teeth whitening typically achieves 6-8 shades of improvement in a single session. Laser teeth whitening can potentially reach 8-10 shades, offering slightly more dramatic results for severely discolored teeth.

Treatment Duration
- Zoom: Approximately 45-60 minutes
- Laser Whitening: 30-45 minutes

Cost Considerations
Zoom treatments generally range from $300-$500, while laser whitening might cost between $500-$1,000, depending on the dental practice and specific technology used.

- Increased temperature sensitivity

Longevity of Results
**Professional whitening results** typically last 6-12 months with proper oral hygiene and maintenance. Patients can extend results through:
- Regular dental cleanings
- Using whitening toothpaste
- Avoiding staining foods and beverages
- Occasional touch-up treatments

Who Should Consider Each Treatment?

Zoom Whitening Ideal For:
- Moderate tooth discoloration
- Patients seeking quick results
- Those with sensitive teeth
- Budget-conscious individuals

Laser Whitening Ideal For:
- Severe tooth staining
- Patients wanting maximum whitening

I'm not even sure how to warn people of sexual content etc. But it definitely has sexual content.  Im a fucking mess and can't even think straight.  I'm basically treating this as a diary add to.just get it all out without consequences. I hope I don't regret this. Okay here it goes....
I'm just guessing this is how I write it based of off two hot takes...omg amateur üôÑ....

Okay I'm a 36 female my husband 35 male.... we met 10 years ago at the coffee shop i worked at. I met him at my work  and basically fell head over heels for his personality. I had never been so forward then I had been when Met him. I asked him out and he was into it. I had just gotten out of a very physically abusive relationship. I spent the evening with this guy, we'll call him Lee. As the night ended we went our separate ways and he told me we would talk again later. A few days go by and he messages me to go on a date... I of course say yes and it went great. The first time I spent the night with him I laid in his arms feeling so safe (my past of abuse kept me from feeling safe for years) because of this I felt, this guy is the one. Cut to 9 years, things are going good. Not great but good. We have 2 kids and have created a family. Throughout the relationship we have ups and downs. Typical relationship issues, nothing ground breaking. 2 years ago things go....South? Side note, i have depression/ history of sexual and physical abuse. I'm on antidepressants which lessens my sexual drive along with the depression.  I basically could be a nun. I want sex but it comes in waves. My husband struggles with this. We try to make it work but there are some months where I fall short of pleasing him. I've basically resorted to having sex with him ONLY when I've been drinking and I'm loosened up. This works for us and he's very understanding until maybe year 7. After that I start to discover weird things. I always knew he watched porn. It's no big deal to me as I also partake. But then one night I get nosy (I know not cool) but i looked through his phone and discover  he looks at snapchat porn..uuuum what? Is snapchat porn cheating? I'm unsure. I tell him about it and he deletes these people. Okay whatever I try to let it go. I then start to realize he is jerking off like  a lot...a lot alot ..it bothers me but I also don't put out and I like porn too sooooo whatev??? Okay cut to 6 mo ago.... my husband and I have a giant dry spell. We know things are not going great so I decided to spice things up. He gardens and spends a lot of time outside. I was drinking and I had put my kids to sleep. I decide to go outside, naked. And I decide to spice it up with some outside sex. He of course loved it. I think to myself, mission accomplished. Were back at it! FALSE!! A week later, after a night of drinking I go to bed. I wake up to my husband feeling me up. You might think ooh he's trying to get her ready for fun sleepy sexy time. No, as soon as I  come to he realizes and pulls back. He is not trying to feel me up to get me turned on. He is taking advantage of me while I sleep. I immediately yell at him and go back to sleep. Things are weird the next day but I move on because I chalk it up to ""we were drunk"".... fast forward to 3 weeks later, i wake up to him trying to push his penis in me while  I sleep. I immediately sit up and freak the fuck out. Side note: he knows i was molested by my step brother when I was little. My step brother molested me while  I was  sleeping in the same way my husband was doing to me!!! 
I immediately jumped up and cursed my husband out. And then immediately punched him in the dick! And yes he was hurting for weeks after. I felt satisfied. And I do not feel bad for feeling happy I punched him in the dick after. 
I reminded him how he made me feel like I was being molested by my step brother and how fucked up he was for doing so. He has annoyingly been apologetic.... keep in mind we have 2 kids together and while it may seem so simple as leaving, it's not. I grew up with divorced parents, my dad got the shit kicked out of him by my step dad while mom sat on my dad's back and held him down while my step dad beat the piss out of him. So childhood trauma is a factor and also a reason why it's not easy for me to leave. I'd rather fake being happy then have my kids live the ""divorced parent"" lifestyle. Anyway cut to 3 months later... now a week later I took a muscle relaxer (I deal with fynromyalgia pain) before bed. It usually knocks me out. I wake up to my husband completely inserting his penis inside me and I immediately panic. He of course apologizes and is embarrassed. I tell him to get the fuck out. He leaves and I feel so gross. Like sew my vagina up and kill myself gross....  i cry myself to sleep. We dont talk for days. Or as much as I can avoid. We still have kids and I have to fake it. What the fuck do I fucking do?

2. ***I am grateful for coffee***

3. ***I am grateful for my cat***
...

‚õß**Self-Concept** ‚Üí write down **10 things** you love about yourself, *can be 5 for personality, 5 for body or simply sort it out as you prefer* ‚Äî I always encourage self concept because it puts **YOU** on a pedestal + self assurance helps you keep your desires.

example:

1. ***I love how intelligent I am***

2. ***I love my big eyes***

3. ***I love my height***
...

‚õß**Desires** ‚Üí write down **10 things** you're manifesting, *again, no matter how big or small*, you can make up affs as you go about each or just write a desire as it is.

example:

1. ***my desired person is in love with me***

2. ***I've passed my desired interview***

3. ***I will travel to Greece***
...

(I'm not gonna keep yapping about how future-present-past tenses don't matter as long as the affs feel natural to you, so write them as you wish please & thank u)

soooo I like to do this when bored & just wanting to sort my priorities out (In a way?)

>**I believe when you're expressing gratitude you're opening yourself to receive** 

*(wether you believe you're the operating source, or believe In external source such as god/universe)* it's gonna work anyway, doesn't matter.

>**followed up with self love, I always promote it because it makes you magnetic to your desires**

it's really helpful to acknowledge you have good qualities & remembering you're deserving of love, wealth & everything else.. so this will get you on that state of ***knowing your worth.***

>**your desires come next because your subconscious will treat them as just other 10 things you have**

since we focused on 20 we already SEE in 3D.

please understand this is **for fun,** I just do it often & feel good afterwards ‚Äî it's not related to any specific Law **so feel free to personalise it as you wish :)**

remember **you're the one holding power,** every method works THANKS to YOU & everything you seek seeks you √ó10 ‚Äî ***you wouldn't have a desire to begin with if you weren't meant to have it,*** so act like it.

& also remember to be gentle with yourself, your emotions aren't against you, don't bottle them up they WON'T ruin your manifestations ‚Äî you're good, you'll get what you want be sure of that.",2,1738726790.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False
1ii10sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ii10sj/losing_a_friend_over_loss/,Losing a friend over loss,"Hi all who read this. I have been racking my mind for months about this and if there is something I could have done differently. I have had a friend for 5 years now who lost her mom last year. Her first loss which is terrible to have your mom be your first loss. I genuinely was there for her when her mom was going through chemo, texting, calling her and always giving her advice on what I had been through with multiple family members. 

She called me when her mom passed and i genuinely texted her everyday day even if she didn‚Äôt answer or pick up the phone. I would leave voicemails just so she could listen to me speak. After awhile she wasn‚Äôt responding, which is completely valid. In my head this was her way of needing space and time to process without the effort of replying to me. 

I told her that I was always here for her when she needed me and to reach out whenever she was ready for a night in or anything. She didn‚Äôt reach out for a few months. 

On her birthday I sent her some money for coffee because she is obsessed with it and wished her a happy birthday. She didn‚Äôt respond until the next day saying ‚Äúthank you but I am upset that you haven‚Äôt talked to me in a little bit‚Äù. I then told her I was sorry, but I just was giving her space and to reach out whenever she was ready. She then didn‚Äôt reply for a week, until I asked her if she wanted to talk about this or if she just wanted space. It turned into a fight and I sent a voice memo because I thought my tone was getting messed up over text. We kind of made up but now she doesn‚Äôt talk to me anymore.

After taking some time to think I have realized that I was always a back up friend to her. She never reached out to me or texted me before any of this happened. I was always the one to message her, make plans to see her, or just exist in her world. She hasn‚Äôt reached out to me or even bothered to message me, I saw that she posted with a new boyfriend and I feel like I was really nothing to her. Sometimes I want to reach out to say my peace but I don‚Äôt because I am scared she will twist my words. I think about her everyday, but I don‚Äôt think our friendship is mendable. Any insight would be appreciated. ",2,1738726704.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1ii0vjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1ii0vjg/how_can_small_businesses_effectively_use_tiktok/,How can small businesses effectively use TikTok for digital marketing?,"**TikTok** offers small businesses a powerful platform to connect with a broad, diverse audience, engage users through creative and authentic content, and build brand awareness. Despite being a platform primarily known for its entertainment value, TikTok can be highly effective for digital marketing, even for small businesses with limited resources. Here‚Äôs how small businesses can effectively use **TikTok** for their marketing efforts:

# 1. Leverage TikTok‚Äôs Viral Nature with Creative Content

TikTok thrives on **creativity** and **authenticity**, so small businesses should embrace the platform‚Äôs informal and engaging style. To stand out, focus on content that is fun, lighthearted, and entertaining, while still staying true to your brand values.

* **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Encourage customers to create content related to your product or service. You can launch a branded hashtag challenge or give incentives for users to share videos using your product in creative ways.
   * **Example**: A **clothing boutique** could encourage users to post ‚Äúoutfit of the day‚Äù videos using the boutique‚Äôs clothing with a custom hashtag (e.g., #MyBoutiqueStyle).
* **Trendy Challenges**: Participate in trending TikTok challenges and incorporate your product in a creative way. These challenges are often already gaining momentum, which can increase your brand‚Äôs visibility.
   * **Example**: A **bakery** could participate in a popular food challenge, showcasing a unique cake or pastry in a fun and engaging video.
* **Behind-the-Scenes Content**: Share behind-the-scenes content that shows the process behind your products or services, the culture of your business, or the story of your brand. This kind of content helps humanize your business and builds a connection with your audience.
   * **Example**: A **local coffee shop** could show how a new drink is created, offering a sneak peek of the brewing process.

# 2. Use TikTok Ads to Boost Visibility

While organic content is valuable, TikTok's **advertising options** can be a powerful tool for small businesses to increase reach and engagement. TikTok ads are often less expensive compared to other platforms like Facebook or Instagram, making them an affordable option for small businesses.

* **In-Feed Ads**: These ads appear in users' For You Page feeds and are a great way to reach a wide audience. They can feature your product, a special offer, or a brand story.
   * **Example**: A **home d√©cor store** could run an in-feed ad showcasing a seasonal sale or a new collection.
* **Branded Hashtag Challenges**: TikTok offers the option to create your own branded hashtag challenge. This encourages users to participate and create their own content, which helps boost engagement and visibility.
   * **Example**: A **fitness brand** could create a hashtag challenge where users share their fitness routines using the brand‚Äôs products, like #MyFitnessChallenge.
* **TopView Ads**: These ads appear when users open the app, giving your brand the prime real estate for maximum visibility.
   * **Example**: A **local restaurant** could use a TopView ad to promote a new menu item or a special offer.
* **Branded Effects**: This ad type allows users to engage with a custom filter or effect created specifically for your brand, helping to increase engagement and spread awareness.
   * **Example**: A **cosmetics brand** could create a filter that allows users to try on makeup virtually or showcase their skincare products in a fun way.

# 3. Collaborate with Influencers

Influencer marketing on TikTok has become a key strategy for brands looking to extend their reach. Small businesses can collaborate with TikTok influencers who align with their brand values and target audience.

* **Micro-Influencers**: Partnering with **micro-influencers** (those with a smaller but highly engaged following) can be a cost-effective way to leverage influencer marketing. Micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates, and their followers trust their recommendations.
   * **Example**: A **handmade jewelry brand** could collaborate with a fashion influencer to showcase their unique pieces in style tutorials or ‚Äúunboxing‚Äù videos.
* **Authentic Product Reviews**: Work with influencers to do **honest reviews** of your product or service. Authenticity is key on TikTok, so choose influencers who can genuinely connect with your brand and speak to your product‚Äôs strengths.
   * **Example**: A **tech startup** could partner with an influencer in the tech space to review a new gadget or app, providing their audience with an honest opinion.

# 4. Use TikTok‚Äôs Music and Sound Features

Music plays a huge role on TikTok, as many videos go viral due to the creative use of trending songs or sounds. For small businesses, integrating music into your content can enhance engagement and help your videos stand out.

* **Use Trending Music**: Keep an eye on the latest trending songs and incorporate them into your content. This can increase the likelihood that your videos will be featured on users' For You Pages.
   * **Example**: A **fitness brand** could create workout videos set to trending music, encouraging users to participate in challenges or routines.
* **Original Sound**: Create your own branded sounds that users can adopt in their content. If your brand has a catchy jingle, slogan, or sound, turn it into a challenge or trend.
   * **Example**: A **restaurant** could create a sound to showcase their signature dish, encouraging users to make videos of themselves trying the dish with that sound.

# 5. Focus on Short, Engaging Content

TikTok is designed for short-form videos, so your content needs to capture attention quickly. Small businesses should focus on creating videos that are concise, engaging, and showcase the value of their products or services in a compelling way.

* **Quick Product Demos**: Show your product in action through quick, snappy product demos or tutorials.
   * **Example**: A **beauty brand** could show how their product enhances the look of skin in a 15-second transformation video.
* **User Testimonials**: Share customer stories or testimonials in a creative and engaging way. Videos of real customers talking about their experience with your product can be more persuasive than traditional ads.
   * **Example**: A **fitness equipment brand** could showcase real users performing exercises with their equipment and explaining how it helped them achieve fitness goals.

# 6. Engage with the TikTok Community

TikTok‚Äôs algorithm prioritizes engagement, so businesses need to actively engage with their audience. Responding to comments, liking videos, and interacting with other creators helps increase your reach and create a community around your brand.

* **Reply to Comments with Videos**: TikTok allows you to reply to comments with a video, which adds a personal touch and encourages further engagement.
   * **Example**: A **local boutique** could reply to a comment asking about product sizing with a short video showing different outfit options in various sizes.
* **Duets and Stitch**: TikTok‚Äôs **Duet** and **Stitch** features allow users to collaborate with other videos. Small businesses can use these tools to collaborate with users or other brands to amplify their reach.
   * **Example**: A **food delivery service** could create a Duet with a user showing how they enjoy their meal, creating a fun interaction between the brand and the community.

# 7. Consistent Posting and Analytics

Consistency is key on TikTok. Posting regularly keeps your brand visible and ensures your content remains fresh. Also, track your performance through TikTok‚Äôs **analytics** to understand what‚Äôs working and adjust your strategy accordingly.

* **Post at Optimal Times**: Use analytics to determine when your audience is most active and post during those times to maximize visibility.
* **Track Engagement Metrics**: Monitor metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and views to gauge the effectiveness of your content. If certain types of posts perform better, tailor your future content strategy accordingly.

# Conclusion

TikTok offers a unique opportunity for small businesses to connect with a highly engaged audience through creative and authentic content. By embracing TikTok‚Äôs fun, viral nature and leveraging tools like **TikTok Ads**, **influencer collaborations**, and **trending sounds**, small businesses can increase brand awareness, drive traffic, and even increase sales.

¬†

Arrival to Saint Lucia and Drive to Resort
¬†

The Saint Lucia international airport is very small. You will deplane directly onto the runway and take a short walk directly to the terminal. The baggage moved pretty quickly for us as we were the only arriving plane at that time. When leaving security, there is a large group of locals that will try to ‚Äúassist you‚Äù with your bags. Just politely decline as the Sandals lounge is literally 50 feet away. The Sandals lounge is quite nice and they will immediately take care of you. My wife and I heard about the rough ride to the resort so we arranged private transportation. Sandals introduced him to us and we took off right away. 
¬†

As many others will attest, this drive kind of sucks. It‚Äôs over an hour through winding roads and if you get carsick, I would seek an alternative transport. That said, it is a beautiful drive through the island and towns. Our private driver was very friendly and answered a lot of questions. He also stopped at a nice viewpoint so we could get some air and take pictures. Keep an eye out for the KFC (you can‚Äôt miss it) as that is a good landmark for when you‚Äôre nearly there. If/when I go back, I would consider the helicopter or a boat to take me to the resort. 
¬†

Arrival at Sandals and Rooms
¬†

You will immediately be met by Sandals employees who are very friendly. They sing a welcome song to you which is super awkward (do they do this at all Sandals??) and will collect your bags and show you to the lounge with coffee (and an espresso machine), snacks, and is well air-conditioned. If you have a butler, they meet you here. The resort itself is beautiful with different species of well-maintained colorful flowers and cool trees all over.
¬†

We opted for one of the suites with a private ‚Äúpool‚Äù near the beach. The room was clean and air conditioned. The bed was a tad firm for me but my wife liked it. Warning that the bathroom has almost no counterspace, instead containing a super-wide sink. This was a little annoying to store our toiletries but not a huge issue. The shower had great water pressure and stayed warm for long showers. The mini-bar was frequently restocked, as was the ice bucket. The maids were always prompt and thorough and we never had an issue with them taking away dishes quickly or coming at inopportune times. 
¬†

We almost never used the pool, as the other pools or ocean were right there and it wasn‚Äôt heated. I would have likely used it in the evening if it was heated but no luck. I discovered a giant slug climbing down the wall near the water one day which grossed out my wife and turned her off the pool. I personally enjoyed watching the slug‚Äôs journey back to the hibiscus plant just at the edge of the pool. I named him Johnathan. 
¬†

Butlers
¬†

Our suite came with butlers. They assign a trio that work together as a team during your stay. You are given a butler phone that allows you to text or call them with anything you might need. Our three were great (Vibert, Marva, Ria) and super helpful. We mainly just used them to save us pool/beach spots and make our dinner reservations so they were probably underutilized. They did surprise us with snacks and lunch a couple times which was nice but I don‚Äôt think we will opt for the butlers in the future. One funny thing is that they will assist you with dinner at the ‚Äúno reservations‚Äù restaurants by having them hold a table for you at a specific time. This to me is the definition of a reservation but I wasn‚Äôt going to argue semantics. 
¬†

Sometimes I felt the butlers were a tad overbearing as they always wanted to escort you to dinner to get instructions for the following day, so we would have to wait for them before heading to dinner (once past our reservation time). By the end of our stay, we just started going in and meeting them by our table. All said, they were helpful and nice people but not necessary to enjoy your stay to the fullest. 
¬†

Food
¬†

This was our first Sandals vacation and my past experiences with resort food have been all over the map in regards to quality (shout out mid-at-best Mexican resorts). I found the food to be excellent overall. Nothing overwhelmingly impressive but genuinely decent meals that I enjoyed. The dining areas are rarely full as they seem to stagger guests to help the cooks handle orders which made for relatively quick turnarounds on food. I found that once dining rooms got really busy, the wheels tended to fall off on service. The portions sizes are not huge which allow you to order an appetizer, main, and dessert without issue. 
¬†

There are 7 places to eat at Halcyon: 
¬†

Bayside: 
¬†

This is located right in the centre of the resort near the main pool and Irie bar. It‚Äôs an open-air dining room with good views of the ocean near that side. 
¬†

They do a breakfast buffet (try the omelet station or the pancakes with banana syrup and pineapple glazed ham) and a lunch buffet (rotating themes). I found the buffets to be fine with enough options to fill me up. Nothing special but a decent meal. 
¬†

At night, Bayside becomes a French restaurant which was above average on the one dinner we attended there. I had ratatouille and a chicken dish which were both quite good. My wife had French onion soup and a fish dish which were also pretty tasty. We shared the cr√®me brulee. Overall, I was quite impressed with my meal but never returned for a second dinner for lack of time. ¬†
¬†

Kelly‚Äôs:
¬†

The ‚Äúover the water restaurant‚Äù juts out over the beach and into the shallows of the ocean. The bridge is right by the main pool and easily accessible. Fortunately, it‚Äôs very aesthetically pleasing with a blue paint job and thatched room. It is a nice resort landmark with a large dining room. The inside is also bright with a ton of windows, high ceilings, and great views. The d√©cor is vaguely nautical but there are two kind of odd photos of sexy female pirates on the wall, so we joked it was more naughtycal. 
¬†

In the morning, Kelly‚Äôs is an ala carte breakfast restaurant. They have a limited menu but were flexible on orders. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict both times we went and added some sauteed callaloo on the side the second day ‚Äì pretty good both times. My wife Caribbean omelet with a hashbrown both times and really liked it. We found service to be a tad slow here compared to the other locations but the view is fantastic and it seemed quieter most mornings, so worth it. 
¬†

At night, Kelly‚Äôs becomes a seafood restaurant which we also found to be quite good at the one dinner we attended there. I had the octopus and tomato bruschetta (really good) and the swordfish (a tad dry). My wife had the crab cake (also really good) and seafood brochette (decent). Hot take but if I returned I would just get a smattering of appies. The dessert is three small pieces of cake to share. Overall, my wife liked Kelly‚Äôs a lot and if we had more time, we would have gone for a second dinner. 
¬†

Marios:
¬†

Marios is located at the back of Bayside in a small dining room. It‚Äôs decorated to look quaint and rustic and there is a central island with the meat/cheese/salad appetizers. It has the fewest seats and doesn‚Äôt take reservations, so you may need to wait unless your butler breaks the rules and ignores the meaning of the word reservation by having them hold a table for you. 
¬†

They serve Italian cuisine ala carte with the antipasti buffet. The antipasti was a big miss for us; the meats were oily, the cheese and bread were hard, and nothing else saved the experience. I had the seafood linguine and my wife had the mushroom penne, both were bland and just fine at best. We were both really underwhelmed so we skipped the dessert and ordered some room service. Overall, not great and we didn‚Äôt go back. 
¬†

Kimonos:
¬†

The restaurant the furthest from the main area, Kimonos shares space with Soy in a little minka by the tennis courts. The manager, Dang, seems to work everyday and is very friendly and helpful. Kimonos makes up most of the dining room with the grills and has 3 cooking/eating areas. Kimonos technically requires a reservation but there always seemed to be empty seats so you could probably try your luck as a walk-in. 
¬†

I‚Äôm a big Hibachi fan so we went to Kimonos twice during our stay (third night and final night). We had different chefs who were both great (shoutout Zion and Joshua). They were very entertaining and kept our groups laughing the whole time. The food was delicious, particularly the fried rice. My wife requested the vegetarian option (Yakisoba noodles and tofu) at the second dinner which were delicious ‚Äì would recommend. Hibachi also offers the chance to make some resort friends in a casual setting, so going early might be a nice way to meet people at the beginning of your stay. Overall, loved Kimonos, I will treasure the video of me catching chicken in my mouth forever. 
¬†

Soy:
¬†

As mentioned above, Soy shares space with Kimonos and is situated on the right side with counter seating facing the sushi chefs. There are only about 10 seats and they do not take reservations but they move pretty quickly. 
¬†

We love sushi and this was an excellent experience. The chefs make everything fresh right in front of you when you order and they are artists. Don‚Äôt be afraid to order 4, 5, or 6+ times as all of the rolls are delicious. I asked for an off-menu chef‚Äôs special roll at the conclusion of our meal and was given an amazing and beautifully made custom roll. This may have been my favourite meal of the trip and I wish we had time to go back for a second visit. 
¬†

Bistro: 
¬†

Bistro is an outdoor restaurant in a big gazebo located at the end of the Sandals beach just off the sand. There is an adjoining bar so if they‚Äôre full, you can just grab a drink while you wait. The views are great. 
¬†

The menu is mostly bar food and fast favourites so they‚Äôre open at lunch during late night hours. We had lunch here a couple of times and a late night snack. I had both Jamaican patties (chicken was better than beef) and the jerk chicken wings. My wife had the nachos, quesadilla, and the BLT. All came with fries. The food was always good and especially hit during the late snack after drinking all day. Overall a solid option for lunch or midnight snack. 
¬†

Isola:
¬†

This is a pizza truck found near the quiet pool and lazy river. You can order and then wander away as it takes about 15 minutes to make. The chef stops taking orders if he gets too busy, but it‚Äôs typically pretty quick. 
¬†

We had three pizzas over the trip either as a snack or lunch and all were good. It‚Äôs a nice option to bring back to your pool or beach spot and casually eat while suntanning or reading. Overall good and I‚Äôm happy it was there. 
¬†


Aside from the restaurants, we ordered room service a few times ‚Äì both for breakfast and a late dinner. The breakfast was decent, we had breakfast burritos and a bagel with lox and cream cheese. The dinner was just fine, we got the mac and cheese and a BLT. Nice to have as an option but not nearly as good as any of the restaurants. 
¬†

Pools, Beach, Activities 
¬†

There are 3 pools at Halcyon (aside from the private or swimup pools). The main pool at the centre of the resort is the biggest and loudest. They play music all day and do games so if you want to relax, I would avoid this. There is a swimup bar and it looks over the beach into the ocean. This is a good place to spend your day if you want to socialize and they work hard to do fun things (like a coconut and rum bar or tie-dye t-shirts). They also play pool games here like water volleyball which is fun. 
¬†

The quiet pool and lazy river are on one side of the resort. It‚Äôs not a true lazy river as there is no propulsion, it‚Äôs really just a long pool and there are better places to relax. The quiet pool is ideal to relax by and big enough for a nice dip. There is a swim up bar here and a covered area to access the bar outside the pool with comfortable seats. Floaties are readily available and people are respectful of their noise level. Ideal to read or relax. 
¬†

The beach is very well-maintained and the sand is incredibly soft. You‚Äôll encounter some algae and shells but it‚Äôs not rocky by any means. There are plenty of loungers, some with shading, and there always seemed to be open spots. Crabs run around from time to time so watch your feet. There are local vendors (souvenirs and excursions) walking around but they‚Äôre not pushy, but rather respectful and pretty chill. My trick is to buy something on day one so you can tell them that you already bought everything you need from ‚Äòthat guy‚Äô. 
¬†

Overall, we split our time pretty evenly between both pools and the beach depending on the day‚Äôs plans. I like to mix it up, but you could find one spot and stick to it for the entire trip. 
¬†

There are also a lot of activities around the resort if you want to switch it up. There are two billiard tables beside the Irie bar and main pool in good condition and if you can‚Äôt find an opponent, the staff are usually willing to play. The covered bar beside the quiet pool has a ping pong table, and again the staff will play. There are a number of games on the property: giant chess, shuffleboard, bocce/lawn bowling, croquet. We played with a few of these and they were in good condition. 
¬†

Entertainment
¬†

There is a big room behind the Irie bar near the main pool where some events will be held for ‚ÄúClub Sandals Loyalty Members‚Äù. They also host nightly entertainment therein or just outside. 
¬†

We caught a couple of these but promoting the nightly entertainment seems to be a major blind spot. If you aren‚Äôt checking the app or sitting by the main pool, you probably have no idea what is happening. It seems like an easy fix to post the nightly entertainment at the bars and hostess stands (they post a daily drink special) and I think our butlers should have mentioned it, but we always seemed to stumble upon the entertainment rather than plan for it. 
¬†

Of what we did attend, we really enjoyed ourselves. The Michael Jackson impersonator was very talented, as was his supporting crew and was a much more fun show than I expected (I also need to know what that dude‚Äôs 9-5 looks like). The fire dancers were very cool and the acrobatics were next level. The country singer was surprisingly really good and Karaoke that followed was a blast. The live saxophonist was criminally underattended (like 10 people in the room?) which I chalked up to poor promoting as she was also excellent. 
¬†

Overall, I think they do a good job with the entertainment, particularly when considered with the pool activities and resort games. That said, you need to take an active role in finding out what is going on. 
¬†

Miscellaneous Resort Comments 


The duty free shop is well-stocked and very helpful (we had to buy a new charger). The prices are a little inflated but they had some fun souvenirs. There are also local vendors that set up by the main pool every couple days with handmade gifts for sale. 
¬†

There are photographers that walk around and take photos. You can set up appointments to get your photos taken (in fact they push this) but we skipped it as we didn‚Äôt really want professionally posed photos when we had so many candid ones and selfies. 
¬†

There are bathrooms near both pools so you don‚Äôt need to return to your room after visiting the swim up bars. I found them to be clean, quiet, and well-stocked. 
¬†

The property has a number of nice lounging places, like hanging swings, day beds, two firepits, and two hot tubs. There are plenty of places to relax at night or away from the crowds. 
¬†

I only turned on the tv in the room once but it was in English and seemed to have a number of channels. There are also tv‚Äôs above the Irie bar which tune into any big sporting events that occur while you are there. 
¬†

It rained 3-4 times while we were there but nothing too heavy and not for very long. It was mostly beautiful weather and clear, sunny skies. 

There are a number of cats that live on the resort and are friendly. My wife and I are big cat people so we enjoyed finding and naming them. One of them frequently slept on the loungers by our pool which we loved. I understand they are well-cared for as they limit the pest population so they are also technically staff. 
¬†

Excursions and Extras¬†


The resort has an in-house spa that offers a number of services. My wife and I purchased a couples‚Äô massage one afternoon which occurred in an intimate gazebo near the beach. The massage was excellent and very relaxing. Note that they will try to sell you stuff at the conclusion. 
¬†

We went on two excursions off-resort and enjoyed them both. 
¬†

The ‚ÄúSunset Snorkel by the Pitons‚Äù was put on by a third-party vendor and had guests from beyond Sandals. The boat ride to the snorkel area was really scenic and beautiful, as was the snorkel area which happened right at the foot of one of the Pitons. The snorkeling itself wasn‚Äôt ideal as the masks were not great quality. The area was also underwhelming with its number of fish. Seeing the Pitons was nice, as was the boat ride, but overall this was a little disappointing. 
¬†

The ‚ÄúRum and Chocolate‚Äù tour was very cool and worth the hour+ of driving. You go to a local chocolate factory where they walk you through the process making chocolate and you get to make your own chocolate bar. I love a hands-on activity so this was great and the chocolate was delicious. The factory itself also sells a number of goods ‚Äì you need to buy the chocolate banana bread. The Rum distillery tour was also very interesting. You get to see the whole process and conclude with a tasting of all the rums. This can be a bit dangerous and I was definitely a tad tipsy by the end. The tour ends with a lunch at a restaurant in the small fishing village of Anse La Raye and this was awesome; I had a delicious jerk chicken and my wife had mahi mahi. This tour was very fun and we really enjoyed experiencing the local culture. 
¬†

Atmosphere 


The atmosphere at Halcyon is very laid back and relaxed. The crowd seemed to skew older ‚Äì around 40‚Äôs-50‚Äôs on average, but there were plenty of younger people (my wife and I are early 30‚Äôs). We really enjoyed the vibe here, it was exactly what we were looking for. We never felt the need to go to La Toc or Grande where I understand it was a bit more exciting but it was easy to do a transfer. 
¬†

The staff were all friendly and helpful. They tend to run on ‚Äòisland time‚Äô a bit but they were amazing overall. The bartenders were all great and knew their stuff (shoutout to Ja at the Irie bar for a great espresso martini). 
¬†

Only one or two guests ever got ‚Äòrowdy‚Äô. A pair of young guys were pretty drunk and disruptive at the end of the fire dancer performance, but they were mostly just funny and I never saw anyone be belligerent or rude. It was a good crowd with a lot of nice people. ¬†
¬†

Conclusion
¬†

Overall, we loved our time at Halcyon Beach and in Saint Lucia generally. This was an amazing vacation that we really didn‚Äôt want to end. In fact we‚Äôve already booked a new vacation to Sandals Jamaica Royal Caribbean next year.

¬†

Arrival to Saint Lucia and Drive to Resort
¬†

The Saint Lucia international airport is very small. You will deplane directly onto the runway and take a short walk directly to the terminal. The baggage moved pretty quickly for us as we were the only arriving plane at that time. When leaving security, there is a large group of locals that will try to ‚Äúassist you‚Äù with your bags. Just politely decline as the Sandals lounge is literally 50 feet away. The Sandals lounge is quite nice and they will immediately take care of you. My wife and I heard about the rough ride to the resort so we arranged private transportation. Sandals introduced him to us and we took off right away. 
¬†

As many others will attest, this drive kind of sucks. It‚Äôs over an hour through winding roads and if you get carsick, I would seek an alternative transport. That said, it is a beautiful drive through the island and towns. Our private driver was very friendly and answered a lot of questions. He also stopped at a nice viewpoint so we could get some air and take pictures. Keep an eye out for the KFC (you can‚Äôt miss it) as that is a good landmark for when you‚Äôre nearly there. If/when I go back, I would consider the helicopter or a boat to take me to the resort. 
¬†

Arrival at Sandals and Rooms
¬†

You will immediately be met by Sandals employees who are very friendly. They sing a welcome song to you which is super awkward (do they do this at all Sandals??) and will collect your bags and show you to the lounge with coffee (and an espresso machine), snacks, and is well air-conditioned. If you have a butler, they meet you here. The resort itself is beautiful with different species of well-maintained colorful flowers and cool trees all over.
¬†

We opted for one of the suites with a private ‚Äúpool‚Äù near the beach. The room was clean and air conditioned. The bed was a tad firm for me but my wife liked it. Warning that the bathroom has almost no counterspace, instead containing a super-wide sink. This was a little annoying to store our toiletries but not a huge issue. The shower had great water pressure and stayed warm for long showers. The mini-bar was frequently restocked, as was the ice bucket. The maids were always prompt and thorough and we never had an issue with them taking away dishes quickly or coming at inopportune times. 
¬†

We almost never used the pool, as the other pools or ocean were right there and it wasn‚Äôt heated. I would have likely used it in the evening if it was heated but no luck. I discovered a giant slug climbing down the wall near the water one day which grossed out my wife and turned her off the pool. I personally enjoyed watching the slug‚Äôs journey back to the hibiscus plant just at the edge of the pool. I named him Johnathan. 
¬†

Butlers
¬†

Our suite came with butlers. They assign a trio that work together as a team during your stay. You are given a butler phone that allows you to text or call them with anything you might need. Our three were great (Vibert, Marva, Ria) and super helpful. We mainly just used them to save us pool/beach spots and make our dinner reservations so they were probably underutilized. They did surprise us with snacks and lunch a couple times which was nice but I don‚Äôt think we will opt for the butlers in the future. One funny thing is that they will assist you with dinner at the ‚Äúno reservations‚Äù restaurants by having them hold a table for you at a specific time. This to me is the definition of a reservation but I wasn‚Äôt going to argue semantics. 
¬†

Sometimes I felt the butlers were a tad overbearing as they always wanted to escort you to dinner to get instructions for the following day, so we would have to wait for them before heading to dinner (once past our reservation time). By the end of our stay, we just started going in and meeting them by our table. All said, they were helpful and nice people but not necessary to enjoy your stay to the fullest. 
¬†

Food
¬†

This was our first Sandals vacation and my past experiences with resort food have been all over the map in regards to quality (shout out mid-at-best Mexican resorts). I found the food to be excellent overall. Nothing overwhelmingly impressive but genuinely decent meals that I enjoyed. The dining areas are rarely full as they seem to stagger guests to help the cooks handle orders which made for relatively quick turnarounds on food. I found that once dining rooms got really busy, the wheels tended to fall off on service. The portions sizes are not huge which allow you to order an appetizer, main, and dessert without issue. 
¬†

There are 7 places to eat at Halcyon: 
¬†

Bayside: 
¬†

This is located right in the centre of the resort near the main pool and Irie bar. It‚Äôs an open-air dining room with good views of the ocean near that side. 
¬†

They do a breakfast buffet (try the omelet station or the pancakes with banana syrup and pineapple glazed ham) and a lunch buffet (rotating themes). I found the buffets to be fine with enough options to fill me up. Nothing special but a decent meal. 
¬†

At night, Bayside becomes a French restaurant which was above average on the one dinner we attended there. I had ratatouille and a chicken dish which were both quite good. My wife had French onion soup and a fish dish which were also pretty tasty. We shared the cr√®me brulee. Overall, I was quite impressed with my meal but never returned for a second dinner for lack of time. ¬†
¬†

Kelly‚Äôs:
¬†

The ‚Äúover the water restaurant‚Äù juts out over the beach and into the shallows of the ocean. The bridge is right by the main pool and easily accessible. Fortunately, it‚Äôs very aesthetically pleasing with a blue paint job and thatched room. It is a nice resort landmark with a large dining room. The inside is also bright with a ton of windows, high ceilings, and great views. The d√©cor is vaguely nautical but there are two kind of odd photos of sexy female pirates on the wall, so we joked it was more naughtycal. 
¬†

In the morning, Kelly‚Äôs is an ala carte breakfast restaurant. They have a limited menu but were flexible on orders. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict both times we went and added some sauteed callaloo on the side the second day ‚Äì pretty good both times. My wife Caribbean omelet with a hashbrown both times and really liked it. We found service to be a tad slow here compared to the other locations but the view is fantastic and it seemed quieter most mornings, so worth it. 
¬†

At night, Kelly‚Äôs becomes a seafood restaurant which we also found to be quite good at the one dinner we attended there. I had the octopus and tomato bruschetta (really good) and the swordfish (a tad dry). My wife had the crab cake (also really good) and seafood brochette (decent). Hot take but if I returned I would just get a smattering of appies. The dessert is three small pieces of cake to share. Overall, my wife liked Kelly‚Äôs a lot and if we had more time, we would have gone for a second dinner. 
¬†

Marios:
¬†

Marios is located at the back of Bayside in a small dining room. It‚Äôs decorated to look quaint and rustic and there is a central island with the meat/cheese/salad appetizers. It has the fewest seats and doesn‚Äôt take reservations, so you may need to wait unless your butler breaks the rules and ignores the meaning of the word reservation by having them hold a table for you.

I had the seafood linguine and my wife had the mushroom penne, both were bland and just fine at best. We were both really underwhelmed so we skipped the dessert and ordered some room service. Overall, not great and we didn‚Äôt go back.

Kimonos makes up most of the dining room with the grills and has 3 cooking/eating areas. Kimonos technically requires a reservation but there always seemed to be empty seats so you could probably try your luck as a walk-in. 
¬†

I‚Äôm a big Hibachi fan so we went to Kimonos twice during our stay (third night and final night). We had different chefs who were both great (shoutout Zion and Joshua). They were very entertaining and kept our groups laughing the whole time. The food was delicious, particularly the fried rice. My wife requested the vegetarian option (Yakisoba noodles and tofu) at the second dinner which were delicious ‚Äì would recommend. Hibachi also offers the chance to make some resort friends in a casual setting, so going early might be a nice way to meet people at the beginning of your stay. Overall, loved Kimonos, I will treasure the video of me catching chicken in my mouth forever. 
¬†

Soy:
¬†

As mentioned above, Soy shares space with Kimonos and is situated on the right side with counter seating facing the sushi chefs. There are only about 10 seats and they do not take reservations but they move pretty quickly. 
¬†

We love sushi and this was an excellent experience. The chefs make everything fresh right in front of you when you order and they are artists. Don‚Äôt be afraid to order 4, 5, or 6+ times as all of the rolls are delicious. I asked for an off-menu chef‚Äôs special roll at the conclusion of our meal and was given an amazing and beautifully made custom roll. This may have been my favourite meal of the trip and I wish we had time to go back for a second visit. 
¬†

We never felt the need to go to La Toc or Grande where I understand it was a bit more exciting but it was easy to do a transfer. 
¬†

The staff were all friendly and helpful. They tend to run on ‚Äòisland time‚Äô a bit but they were amazing overall. The bartenders were all great and knew their stuff (shoutout to Ja at the Irie bar for a great espresso martini). 
¬†

Only one or two guests ever got ‚Äòrowdy‚Äô. A pair of young guys were pretty drunk and disruptive at the end of the fire dancer performance, but they were mostly just funny and I never saw anyone be belligerent or rude. It was a good crowd with a lot of nice people. ¬†
¬†

Conclusion
¬†

Overall, we loved our time at Halcyon Beach and in Saint Lucia generally. This was an amazing vacation that we really didn‚Äôt want to end. In fact we‚Äôve already booked a new vacation to Sandals Jamaica Royal Caribbean next year.

40 year old male here in Arizona. Looking for a text friend to pass the time with.  Currently going thru a divorce. I realized I need more chat buddies. 

Some things I enjoy are sports, especially college basketball and baseball. Watching Twitch. MST3K and Rifftrax. 

I‚Äôm also currently looking for some cool resort/hotel destination to travel to around Arizona or even New Mexico. If you know any spots feel free to give me a suggestion and ideas. Plus any food/bar recommendations there or I should travel to. I want to also start getting into good coffee making. Have any tips of machines or processes we can chat about that too.

1ii0pnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ii0pnz/i_have_never_been_particularly_good_at/,I have never been particularly good at remembering my own name.,"This is not to say I don‚Äôt know it. I do. It is a good name. A strong name. A name that has belonged to warriors and kings and accountants alike. But some days, it feels like an ill-fitting suit‚Äîborrowed, unfamiliar, the sleeves too long, shoulders too stiff.

Today is one of those days. The coffee is too bitter, the sun too bright, and my name‚Äîwhatever it is‚Äîtoo foreign on my tongue. So I do what I always do: I go to work and pretend none of it matters.

I sit beside the window, next to the water cooler that gurgles like it's drowning. People walk past, nodding, smiling, forgetting me in the next breath. A good system. Predictable. Orderly.

Until today.

Today, someone stops. A woman in a blue dress. She looks at me like I am a half-forgotten dream‚Äîcurious, uncertain, on the edge of recognition.

‚ÄúYou look different.""

I consider this. Different how? Taller? Shorter? Less of a person than I was yesterday? The coffee was bitter. The sun was bright. My name was lost somewhere between the alarm clock and the shower drain. Bound to have an effect.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I do.‚Äù 

She frowns like she might argue, but doesn‚Äôt. Just nods. Walks away. A small mercy.

Evening. The sun has bled out over the horizon, staining the sky in hues of something violent. I take the train. My reflection flickers in the windows. It does not look like me.

At the station, a man bumps into me. When I turn, I see his eyes widen. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you.""

I do not know him. I am sure of this. I am sure of very little, but of this, I am sure.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs you. You were there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bridge. Yesterday.‚Äù

Yesterday, I was at home. I was at home drinking tea and reading about the extinction of the northern white rhinoceros. I was at home watching the clock tick toward morning. I was at home forgetting my own name.

I was not at the bridge.

‚ÄúYou must be mistaken.""

He isn‚Äôt listening. His hand is gripping my sleeve now, urgent, shaking. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äî‚Äù His voice falters. 

‚ÄúYou jumped.‚Äù

A beat.

The train hums, a distant, mechanical heart. The sky is dark now, the streetlights buzzing like a swarm of dying things. His fingers tremble. Breath uneven.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù I say. Because I didn‚Äôt.

But he looks at me like I did. Like I am something that shouldn‚Äôt be standing here. Something that shouldn‚Äôt be at all.

His hand drops away. His mouth opens, closes, like a fish suffocating on air.

And then he runs.

I stand there. The train has left and the station is empty. I ache to press my palm to my chest, to feel the quiet proof of existence.

But I find that I can't.

I have never been particularly good at remembering my own name.

Maybe that is because it is not mine to remember.",18,1738725726.0,shortscarystories,2,0.95,False

Velvet salamander in a coffee jar  
Drives a pickup truck through a sushi bar  
The suns got a migraine the moons got a tan  
And im trading vinyl dreams with a hologram man  
  
Kaleidoscope fever my brains on rewind  
Dilated worms crawling out of my mind  
I glued the wallpaper to my left side shoe  
Now im breakdancing on a kangaroo  
  
Cobwebs on the satellites spinning out of tune  
Disco ball tornado in a helium balloon  
Static in the rhythm static in the rhyme  
Touchdown on the surface of imaginary time  
  
Origami napkins with a side of rain  
I graffiti my thoughts onto an airplane  
The skys got freckles and the grass hums the past  
im a polaroid priest with a cadillac¬†  
  
Microchip orchard where the robots play  
They surf digital waves until the pixels decay  
I stitched my confusion to a thrift store vest  
And im moonwalking with lemon zest  
  
A carousel of icebergs locked in a trance  
a million ancient powers trying to learn how to dance  
im peeling off the logic like a peeling tangerine

Here is a quick guide for writing your Congress Critters.

1) Be respectful (yes, even to Mike Lee). If you are writing your senators (everyone has 2), you address them as ""Senator"" or, if you are addressing them in their capacity as the chair of a committee, Mr. or Ms. Chair. If you are talking to a House member (link below to find out who your rep is), address them as Congressman/woman or Representative.  
2) Keep it short - we are talking 2-3 paragraphs, tops:  
a) 1st paragraph is your name, and where you live (to signify that you are a constituent) you don't have to put your full address, city is fine.  
b) 2nd paragraph is the main point you would like to get across and, if appropriate, what solution you would like to see. This is ONE POINT - No tangents, no rambling. Nothing is stopping you from writing them a second time for a separate issue right after hitting send.  
c) 3rd paragraph is for thanking them for their time and prompt response.

And that is basically it. Here is an example:

\###

Dear (Senator Lee/Curtis) OR (Representative Moore/Maloy/Kennedy/Owens),

My name is \[Full Name\], and I am a (lifelong, 5-year, whatever) resident of Utah currently living in \[City\], and I am writing you today because I am concerned about the reported activities Elon Musk is allegedly engaging in at the Office of Management and Budget; specifically the allegations that Musk is locking Federal Employees out of systems that contain the personal information of millions of employees and installing unsecured servers to private federal networks - both of which are major security threats and, if true, appear to be an abuse of power.  
  
I urge you, as a member of Congress, whose duty it is to provide a check and balance to the Executive Branch, to open an investigation to ensure that Mr. Musk is using the powers granted to him responsibly, and not for personal or political gain, either for himself or the President.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

\###

And that's basically it!

Oh, and don't actually expect the senator/rep to actually read your message, it will almost certainly be some poor intern. But, that being said, flood them with legitimate concerns - if the intern is busy responding they can't get the good congress person their coffee or Diet Coke, and it will become harder and harder for them to ignore.

However, lately her and her boyfriend (19 m) have been having some issues. I never liked her boyfriend to begin with, and my friend has always known that. Him and I have had our fair share of screaming matches since they got together and if I lacked the impulse control we probably still would. One thing I noticed when him and I would have these screaming matches is that he would tell me things that my friend hadn't told me. 

Last week she called me at 7:00 AM to complain to me about her boyfriend for what felt like the hundredth time. I was sick at the time so hadn't been getting much sleep but looking back at it I honestly don't regret a word I said. I'll write how the conversation went but I will use fake names for privacy and respect.

Me: Hey, I'm still pretty sick so I'm really tired right now, is everything alright?  
Kayla: \*sobbing\* Dominic is being so mean right now, we were supposed to meet for coffee but we got into a fight this morning and now he won't talk to me  
Me: Kayla just give it some time, try to breath and maybe you two can go for coffee tomorrow or do something later  
Kayla: I don't wanna do it tomorrow I wanna do it today!  
Me: I know, but Kayla I've tried to tell you before that when you two get like this it's not healthy and you both just need to give each other some space.  
Kayla: This is so stupid, I don't get why he's like this  
Me: I've tried to tell you multiple times that I honestly don't think you guys are right for each other, you call me like this almost every other day  
Kayla: No I love him, we're just having a tough time right now.  
Me: Kayla I'm sorry but I'm sick of this, you call me like this all the time for advice and you never listen. I've tried to help you multiple times but clearly you don't want help, you just want to complain and I'm not the person you should do that to. I've been way to stressed right now to deal with dumb things like these and you know it. I can't control you but I've tried to give you advice so many times, so if you don't wanna listen then I'm not going to either. You can take my advice or don't talk to me about him anymore. 

Then she hung up the phone but I was to tired and to sick to care. I texted her later in the day apologizing for being so harsh but I told her my point still stands. She didn't respond so I left it at that but I've tried to text or talk to her about unrelated things and she's still ignoring me. AITA?",5,1738724817.0,AmItheAsshole,15,1.0,False

Ever since then I‚Äôve really wanted my own espresso machine and to enjoy it not just in a workplace but as a hobby since it rly makes me happy, just last week I got my hands on a Breville Barista Pro from Marshall‚Äôs for 500 which seemed like a good deal and I‚Äôve been trying to dial it in for the past three days. 

I‚Äôve bought all of the extra equipment except for a separate burr grinder (I use the built in burr grinder) and have followed all of the videos and guides and I haven‚Äôt been able to get a single good shot
I have a WDT, a bottomless portafilter, a scale, and a palm distributor/ tamp and I am using medium to dark roasts from sprouts farmers market. I am STRUGGLING here and coming up with issues I never had to even think about at Starbucks with the several thousand dollar machines that did most of the work for me, even at haagen dasz where we had a much more manual and commercial machine I never had these problems and I‚Äôm started to get super discouraged.

My shots are never consistent, they are always super bitter, and following the guides leads to contradicting advice, for example:
Bitter espresso usually means it‚Äôs over extracted and the grind size may be too fine/ the temperature might be too hot. But then that same shot is also pulling after like 3 seconds and hitting 36g in 20, so going courser would only make the shot pull even faster. And adjusting the temp doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing anything. 

Is this just part of the process of learning how to make your own espresso at home? Am I confusing bitter for sour and therefore following the wrong steps to correct that? I‚Äôm super overwhelmed with all the variables and my inability to accurately troubleshoot my shots and know what adjustments they need and I‚Äôm at a point where I truly don‚Äôt know what else I could try other than different beans to hopefully get a shot that isn‚Äôt extremely bitter and pulling in 30ish seconds on a 1:2 ratio 

TLDR:
I‚Äôm a former Starbucks employee learning to make my own espresso at home for the first time with a machine that I‚Äôve seen has a bad reputation and am stressed out dialing in my new machine since I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going wrong in my routine. I could really use some tips or words of encouragement as a noobie here hoping to become a part of the at-home espresso community. Pls ask questions about my process and I‚Äôll be sure to respond with more details ",1,1738724703.0,espresso,59,0.57,False

This was the scent that started it all, and it was love at first sniff for sure. Some people describe it as a bakery, but that‚Äôs definitely too simplistic. Think of a very sweet Christmas/fruit cake with a ton of spice, a hint of vanilla, and coffee poured on top and you have Qahwa. You really do just want to drink it. This is my most complimented fragrance, which I don‚Äôt think really matters, but it is also my wife‚Äôs favorite, which definitely does matter.¬†

It lasts about 8 hours on my skin with the first two being quite strong, but with 2-3 sprays on my neck and one on my hand (for if I ever want a sniff) I know people a foot or two away can smell me.

My only complaint with this one is that it isn‚Äôt the most versatile. Being a college student I only wear this for more formal/serious occasions (exam, date night, serious work to do, presentation) since I think of it as a bit more mature of a scent.¬†

* The Kingdom - Scent 4.5/5, Performance 4.5/5

I thought I got scammed with this one when I bought it and Tharwah Gold for my wife (banger btw!). It smelled like straight rubbing alcohol and a hint of mint, but I learned the patience of waiting for scents to mature and a month and a half later it is my most worn fragrance. It smells just like everyone says: vanilla, mint, lavender, but one thing that surprised me is just how light it is. JPG le male elixir is a lot heavier in my opinion, but the mint here is super aromatic and soft. I‚Äôm a big fan.

Performance is about the same as Qahwa, although I did have it last on me about 10 hours overnight once which was crazy work.

This is my most worn because of how versatile it is. Very much a blind grab scent. It will work in any weather unless it‚Äôs super hot, and will receive lots of love!

* Ard Al Zaafaran Al Dirgham Special Edition (the silver one) - Scent 4.5/5, Performance 3.5/5

Shoutout to that man u/Low-Stomach-8831 for this undercover gem. As promised, it smells just like Liquid Brun, but it only cost me $24 with shipping included ($17 without!!!). What a steal. The strong, sweet vanilla, and orange are combined together into a surprisingly powdery yet full scent. I LOVE it. The wife is less of a fan unfortunately.

I‚Äôve had it for about a week and a bit, so performance is bound to get better, but right now it‚Äôs about 5-6 hours, with the first hour projecting well. Not too much to complain about for 120ml for $17, but if it improves more (which I anticipate), this might be the biggest steal on the market. I would wear this one any time except the summer.

* Al Haramain Amber Oud Gold Edition - Scent 4/5, Performance 5/5

At first this one smelled like straight shampoo dude. Not even nice shampoo, just a head-and-shoulders soapy mess. After letting it sit a week or two it has done a full 360 and I now get a sweet melon with a tinge of pineapple, with the shampoo smell in the background. As it dries down the shampoo comes further forward. This is going to be a great one for when it warms up.

This is the strongest scent I have ever smelled, and one half-spray on each side of my neck is plenty. It may be 60ml but it will definitely last me forever at this rate. Beware with this one, it‚Äôs potent.

* Turathi Blue - Scent 2.5/5, Performance ???

I‚Äôve let this one sit for about a month and it seems my blind buy luck finally hit a wall. I get the grapefruit and I understand why that might appeal to some, but the musk is seriously too much. Without as much musk and maybe some citrus it would be a banger, but because it is weighed down so much, this doesn‚Äôt feel summer-y like I wanted it to at all. I get the bug spray thing for sure.

¬†I haven‚Äôt ever worn it long enough to figure out how long it lasts. I‚Äôm going to keep letting it sit and pray that somehow in June I‚Äôll pull it out and it‚Äôll be great.

Anyways, hope this was helpful to some!! I know blind buying is like the ultimate sin but I‚Äôm pretty darn happy with what I got. Next up I‚Äôm looking at Coconut Lagoon by Paris Corner (anyone have it lmk what you think below!!)",1,1738724656.0,fragranceclones,2,1.0,False
1ii0dbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ii0dbq/aita_for_not_moving_stuff_out_of_the_kitchen/,AITA for not moving stuff out of the kitchen sooner?,"I am in need of some perspective.

Background: We (my wife, son, and daughter) moved in with my mom after she offered to take us in after we couldn't afford our apartment anymore.

I recognize that she took us in when she didn‚Äôt have to and is doing a shit ton to support us as I don't have a job at the moment. We also brought trouble on her, because our old apartment had roaches REALLY BAD and we ended up bringing them with us. (She was aware of the roach problem before we moved in.)

I feel terrible, and I tell her at every opportunity that we will 1) reimburse her for the pest control treatments and any damages out of our tax refund and 2) that it should not have happened.

I do everything she asks to help get rid of them, just not in the best way she has in mind.

So today she wanted us to remove all the stuff from the cabinets in the kitchen in preparation for pest control, which is happening tomorrow morning. She also wanted us to move all the stuff away from the baseboards in the house. She told us to do that today and **not before**.

However, today she also scheduled four client meetings in the kitchen on her computer that included private medical information, so I thought it would be better to wait until that was over.

I went into my bedroom to wait on the final two calls to end after spending most of the day running errands and pulling stuff away from the walls, expecting that (as she had told me she would at other points) she would let me know when she was done. I went ahead and laid down while she was doing this because I have bronchitis atm.

But when she finished her calls, she didn‚Äôt let us know. She just picked up coffee tables and started moving them into the living room so she could do all the moving things out of the kitchen herself. I heard the banging and came out to investigate oh hey, is she done? And she was done, but was throwing a fit about us not getting all the stuff moved before that point.

According to her, what we should have done was finish up between her client calls.

Which is a fair request, if she had made it.

I asked her if she would like help with moving the tables and she said no. So I started moving things out of the kitchen. We were done in about fifteen minutes. She acted angry the whole time i.e. banging things around.

She told me I could go be homeless if I didn‚Äôt like her banging things around and to stop copping an attitude about her being mad since we were the ones who brought roaches into the house. I tried to validate that of course she is pissed off, she has every right to be. But that her taking her anger out on us by slamming doors and the like was not okay. It did not go well.

AITA for not moving the stuff sooner?

She stared at the unassuming man sat across from her, her eyes threatening to spill the tears she'd held back all night. 

""So,"" Mary said, taking a long drag ""this is it then?""

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please!"" She sucked in a breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could get more time. 

""Please let me have a few more years. I'm not ready to go.""

""Mary, you signed a contr-""

""I know I signed the goddamned contract! I was desperate! I didn't know what else to do!""

She placed her head in her hands and wept, the man patiently waiting for her speak again. She wiped her nose with the back of her hand and placed her cigarette, still smoking, into the ash tray. The man stood and offered a hand to her. 

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

""It's hell, Mary? What do you think it's like?""

------------

Sheriff Thompson stepped out of his patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of the officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size and wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called.""

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbors?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair. Oh, I run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Kids?""

""She had a husband and long while ago but he died shortly after their boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin back then and i guess the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin, the next day he's... not.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr Webb nodded, walking back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

------------

The Sheriff walks into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank you, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down at his desk to go over his findings. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""The ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the ashes. They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not singed the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah. We've been going over this case for weeks and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense.""

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ii061g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1ii061g/curacao_great_resort_with_a_little_meh_thrown_in/,Curacao - Great resort with a little ‚Äúmeh‚Äù thrown in,"Just spent a week in Curacao and really had a great time. Was it perfect, nah, but you know what it was sure as hell a great time. Here‚Äôs my thoughts on Curacao. 

Resort in general: Gorgeous. Wow it‚Äôs really up there as far as overall just beautiful and nice. Beautiful landscaping, beautiful area, and just a great looking place. 85 degrees every single day was just awesome when you leave a cold and dreary home to go there. 

Staff: Nothing but good stuff to say for the people. Really enjoyed our interactions with just about every single person. Super nice, super fun, and really made it easy to enjoy our stay. Our butler team of Jelita, Nicky, and Florette were top notch! 

Room/s: We split stay in Kurason Island and the Seaside rooms. Basically the same exact room layout but obviously the location is really different. The Kurason‚Ä¶..meh. The heart pool is cool, but you are surrounded by additional rooms and it‚Äôs just really not that great. If I would have had the option to book maybe the Rondovals and the Seaside (the rondovals weren‚Äôt done/bookable when we booked and I dropped the ball to try to switch when they were) I would have. Kurason, to me, just isn‚Äôt worth it overall in the end. Still a good room and location, but I would have done something else all things considered or just did the seaside the entire 7 days in the end. The Seaside was friggin awesome. We got the very front room (4105) and we really liked it. That big pool was great to just hang out in for most of the day and listen to the ocean that‚Äôs a stone‚Äôs throw away. It still felt fairly private even though every once in a while people would walk by out front. We really liked that room and thought it was a lot of fun. One big perk was that the A/C had no issues keeping up at any point. We actually had to turn it down at night to not freeze us out. So that was good. 

Food: So this was a bit of a toss up. We really liked a lot of the food, but some was really kind of so-so. Lunch seemed to be where they really suffer. Strand for lunch was hit and miss. The salads and sandwiches were really kind of blah for the most part. The pizza from Pietra‚Ä¶.really not that great as the crust was soggy and overall they were just bland, which is hard for a pizza. The food trucks were overall a hit, but some of the items were weak. I won‚Äôt harp too much on that simply because there were plenty of options that we really did like. We laughed because the ‚Äúbowls‚Äù at Kisha were served on a plate but the food was really good. Kanaal was awesome and had the great coffee/ice cream/desserts that you would expect. 

Main restaurants were pretty good overall for dinner and breakfast. We ordered into our room for breakfast quite a bit from the Aolos and Butch‚Äôs menu, and enjoyed the options. Dinner was great at Butch‚Äôs, Aolos, Gatsu Gatsu, and Pietra, but we were kind of disappointed with Zuka. Zuka was just ‚Äúoff‚Äù in our opinion. Everything was dry, cold. We would have asked for it to be re-done, but we had already waited a pretty decent chunk of time to get what we had. That was really our only disappointment in the mix of dinners. Other than that, we really had zero issues with slow service or problems like have been mentioned previously. It was on point for the most part. Our travel agents did buy us a candlelight dinner for our anniversary that was on Thursday and that meal was really good. Ton of food and we were way overstuffed by the time we were done, but great meal overall. 

Pool: That is a pretty awesome main pool. We hung out there for a full day when we were in the Kurason rooms, and had a lot of fun. Plenty of people, activity, and drinks to really soak it in over there. We had a great setup right on the pool with umbrella and nice lounge our butler set us up with. 

Beach: Well, this is a mixed bag. It‚Äôs different obviously because it‚Äôs the closed off smaller water section in that boat channel into the port area. It‚Äôs lacking vs. the other beaches we have seen in Grenada, South Coast, and Grand St Lucian so that was a little bit of a downer, but we knew it coming in and overall enjoyed it otherwise. Still great sand and great area to hang out in. We liked it for sure. 

Dine Out: A big highlight was taking advantage of the Dine Out option with our 7 days in the appropriate rooms. We did Kome for brunch on Saturday and wow, that food was off the hook. So damn good. Was a quick 40 min ride from the resort and so worth it. We ate and drank and even had enough leftover to get a bottle of wine. If Sandals could figure out how to have food even 50% as good as this they would be awesome. This was a cool trip off resort and anyone that can should take full advantage of it. 

Overall a great stay. Highly recommend the resort. Of the 4 resorts we have been to (Grenada 2x, South Coast, Grand St Lucian, and now Curacao) we probably still put Grenada as our top, but then St Lucian and Curacao are probably fighting it out for 2nd place.

Hope this community can get me back on track.,"A little about me: a few years ago I topped out at 282 pounds and I was miserable. I started walking a few miles a day and saw some mild weight loss and was feeling good. So I got MyFitnessPal and decided to eat only 1200 calories a day. That goal proved extremely difficult with three meals a day, so I decided to try OMAD, drinking only black coffee and water until dinner time. For dinner I ate what I enjoy and simply kept it at or under my calorie goal. I found that not eating all day made everything, even food that is normally not a favorite, so much more delicious. The pounds started melting off and because I was walking so much my body changed really well with the loss. I got to just below 200 pounds in 8 months and then my life started falling apart. Devastating losses, career setbacks, you name it. I got really depressed and gained the weight back. Then this last year I was pretty badly injured in a fall and during the last nine months of recovery have gained even more back. 

Now I can walk again, though not like I did, but I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble getting myself back into the OMAD mindset. I want that feeling of success back, but I also don‚Äôt want to discipline myself just to get hurt (emotionally or physically) when I finally start to like myself again. After reading posts on this sub, I think this might just be the place to help me find my groove again.

I have had several severe concussions and been diagnosed with a mild Chiari malformation. More often than not my migraines were triggered by the weather when the pressure changed drastically too quickly. The migraines I will get are horrible spotty vision ice pick feeling head in a vice but like I‚Äôm sure everyone else knows there are levels to the migraines. 

Since I was 16 and went to the Neurologist for my first concussion I have been super careful about what I eat to avoid unnecessary triggers. I am extremely careful on how much caffeine I consume. Always monitoring my sodium, nitrate, sugar levels. I don‚Äôt eat processed food. I don‚Äôt drink coffee or energy drinks. I drink tea or a small regular soda once a day. Artificial sweeteners and tannins are instant migraine triggers so I avoid them completely. I eat 50% vegetarian pretty raw and whole. For years I had my migraines under such control I had one maybe every 6-8 months. In the past year however I‚Äôve been getting a migraine one every 5 weeks (timed it to see if period related it‚Äôs not) but since October it‚Äôs been like 2-3 weeks if not every other week. I‚Äôve started puking because of them. And not just once and being done but the whole night and become completely incapacitated whereas I used to be able to at least function. 

Has anyone else experienced such a drastic shift in their normal ‚Äúroutine‚Äù? everything I used to do to stop them doesn‚Äôt seem to work anymore.

so some backstory: i have only dated one other person and that was when i was fifteen. it lasted a year and then we broke up very amicably, but a large part of that relationship was online because she moved like a month after we started dating. so obviously we never did anything physical. (trust me, I'm aware this is lame but its what im working with.) technically, last year, i had a boyfriend, but we broke up after a week so i don't really count it. we just weren't a good fit and i didn't feel like the relationship was going anywhere. we kissed but that was it!! because i was very very nervous about doing anything like that in such a new relationship. 

that's basically my entire dating history so ill move on to my current circumstance. i got hinge in october 2024 immediately after my birthday because me and my friends wanted to see what it was all about. i used it pretty casually but never with any real intent to find something serious on there. spoiler alert: i met someone. for the sake of simplicity i'll just call them AJ. they are very sweet, very funny, and they get me in ways i don't think even my first girlfriend got me. which kinda leads into my problem. 

we've been talking since november but due to our schedules and school break and stuff, we didn't have time to meet up. now we do. im very nervous!! i've never been on a first date before and i really like them. they wanted to pay for everything and im going to be driving because they don't have a car. none of this is a problem, but we kinda already have another date planned towards april because a band i really like is coming to town and we thought it would be fun to see them together. AJ doesn't even really like the band, but they know i do, so they suggested it to me. so clearly by their actions, they like me, I can tell that much. we are very vocal with how we feel in general but i think actions are what prove the words to be true. we have both communicated our interest in each other, they are just so easy to talk to that it isn't awkward. honestly, it's all going really well. that's why im scared. i really want this to work out but i guess i am also worried since i have such little experience, ill have no idea if any of this is a bad sign and then if it all crashes and burns, it'll just hit me in the face and ill have invested myself into something that i'm going to spend ages getting over.

so i guess i just want to know what you guys think? i've never felt this intensely about another person before. is this a bad sign? should I be more cautious? sorry im rambling im just kinda nervous. i have no idea what to wear to a first date anyway. we are going for coffee and then visiting a bookstore so it should be pretty casual.",1,1738723663.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Or how he‚Äôs never had valentine. Like man. I don‚Äôt think he realizes what an amazing guy he is. Like there‚Äôs just too much to like about him that it almost all overlooks his unliked qualities. 

Things I like abt him: his dorkish smile. The way he used to assure me when I was anxious. The way he would always wait for me to leave the room before exiting himself (he stopped doing it after a certain point and that made me really sad). He‚Äôs a sentimental guy. Have me a full ass letter compared to my small notebook size note. Hid hand writing is also nice. He writes in cursive which is really pretty. I love how he works to be his best self to everyone. He talks about how he wants to be nice to everyone which I gotta admit can be hard. And I know he wants to be makes positive impression on everyone and I gotta say: he does. He strives to be his best self every day and that takes dedication and commitment. I also love how even tho we‚Äôre not close to each other, he still works to hang out with me. Last semester I got shut down for hanging out almost everytime after the one time we hung out but this semester he‚Äôs really working to make sure he has time for me which means a lot. I love how I know he cares. Like the first time we got coffee, he talked about how he wanted to be there for me. And while I hate that it‚Äôs only on a friendship level, I just love that I know he‚Äôs there. He didn‚Äôt judge me for trying to leave. He made nothing change from our time apart. And I think he‚Äôs gonna try to rememeber my bday but I kinda hope he doesn‚Äôt cause almost every phone call and every time we hang out, I find something that makes me just fall harder. I love how he‚Äôs clear about what he wants from me. And yes it kills it‚Äôs just friendship but at this rate I almost take anything over nothing. 

This guy. He has a list of qualities that makes him so suitable for dating. I don‚Äôt get how he hasn‚Äôt found someone. He‚Äôs genuine. And sweet. He listens. He‚Äôs honest. He‚Äôs committed to being a good friend and person over all. I love how he‚Äôs so driven to follow his passion and I admire that he talks a lot about doing gods will. I love that he‚Äôs driven to be the best self he can be. 

I just don‚Äôt get how this guy doesn‚Äôt see it himself. He‚Äôs cute. He‚Äôs funny. He‚Äôs a really good person. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people of look up to him. He‚Äôs mature. And I also stilll can‚Äôt get over how funny it is he can‚Äôt say the word sex. He uses the word ‚Äúfun‚Äù which is really ironic cause I use that word also on Reddit so I don‚Äôt get in trouble. He also pronounces the name of a building the same way I pronounce it. And we have similar views of social media which I feel like is hard to find now a days. (Wishing this guy would start a streak with me on Snapchat. lol). 

I just really don‚Äôt get it. Maybe I have no standards and really do just fall for any guy who‚Äôs nice to me. But if I had to pick out of all of the guys I‚Äôve wanted. I‚Äôd choose him. Cause I know he‚Äôs a genuine good person. He‚Äôs never been confusing about what he wants. He‚Äôs never changed his mind out of the blue. He‚Äôs understanding. And sweet and he‚Äôs honest. (I need hades from Hercules  to come say ‚ÄúHES A GUY!!!‚Äù) 

Ugh. It just pisses me off he doesn‚Äôt realize how great he is. I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever liked someone better. I just find it so hard to not like him. And I admit yesterday after we got some food I really annoyed with him. But like. I really just wish he saw it in himself. I wish he saw how lucky someone‚Äôs gonna be have him by her/his side. I feel like anyone is gonna be lucky to have him as a friend. And I don‚Äôt know. He just makes life so much better by simply being around. He‚Äôs one of those guys that just makes this world a better place. He gives me hope that maybe one day I‚Äôll find a guy like him who will love me. And right now I wish it was him. But I know that‚Äôs not gonna happen no matter how many of you tell me it could happen. 

I just want to take my glasses and put them on him then face him to a mirror and maybe he‚Äôll see what I see in him. I hope he finds someone who can make him see it cause I don‚Äôt think I can due to my belief that if I ever share how I truly feel it‚Äôll scare him off. Lol. I hope he sees it in himself one day. Cause it kills me he doesn‚Äôt see it. 

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever been pissed if by him. But like. I just truly don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt get what he doesn‚Äôt see himself that I see. I know this skewed by Limerence  but almost everything I see about him, I like/love it. I‚Äôm super jealous of whoever gets to be in his life forever. I‚Äôm jealous of his future gf. His future wife. I hope he never gets hardened by life. Cause we just need more people like him. 

This summer is gonna suck. I‚Äôm not ready to have him leave. I know I have time. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel like enough. Not when we only hang out every other week. And I honestly bet we could take longer since he doesn‚Äôt initiate and has a social battery that gets drained when he goes out.

For 19 years, I drank 8‚Äì16 oz of coffee daily. That streak ended on January 9th when I started feeling sick. At first, I had no idea what was going on, just lingering back pain and a vague sense that something was off. I even wondered if it was appendicitis, though it never got bad enough to justify an ER visit. Turns out, it was a UTI, but it took me a full week to figure that out.

I also stopped being able to regulate my body temperature around the 11th. (That ability came back around January 31st.) I was FREEZING all month, and normally I run hot.

I got antibiotics on January 14th, but my body *hated* them. I spent 3 days vomiting and dry heaving, and after finishing the medication, my back pain hadn‚Äôt gone away. That led to an ER trip on the 22nd for blood work and a CT scan. Everything came back fine, and thankfully, the pain eventually resolved.

At this point, I hadn‚Äôt had coffee in 13 days, but on the morning of the 22nd, I had a small (6 oz) cup. The next day, I came down with *something* I probably picked up at the hospital.... fever (102¬∞F), cough, runny nose, chills.... the whole flu package. My appetite disappeared, so I stopped drinking coffee again. That flu stuck around for about 10 days, but as of February 1st, I‚Äôm *mostly* feeling better.

I also have lost 17lbs since January 9th. (I have gained back about 5 by now.)

**Here‚Äôs the problem:** I am still completely drained. I have had no energy since January 9th, and now, I‚Äôm dealing with dizziness, hot flashes, and extreme brain fog. I know my body has been through a lot this past month, so maybe it‚Äôs just recovery taking longer than expected..... But I‚Äôm wondering, could this still be caffeine withdrawal?

Everything I‚Äôve read says withdrawal should last about nine days, but I‚Äôve seen posts here claiming symptoms can drag on for 90+ days. However, I haven‚Äôt come across mentions of dizziness or hot flashes, which is why I‚Äôm asking:

**Has anyone experienced hot flashes from caffeine withdrawal this far out (2+ weeks)?**

Something to be aware of is just because a business of brick and mortar is still standing, It doesn't mean they're doing well. 

In fact, downtown Sierra Madre served 60% of Altadena customers. Those are the customers that no longer frequent the area. 

The best way to support these small businesses and keep them in town is to buy gift cards at this time. Gift cards not only will pay the businesses bills that are outstanding right now from lost inventory with the power outages and the loss of clientele, but you can also hand out those gift cards to families that may have lost everything and they're too busy buying essentials. 

Just think providing a family with reprieve and allowing them to have a scoop of ice cream or a coffee from a place or a burger from a place and not have to worry about. Buying socks and insurance is such a blessing at this time.

I wake up early and go to bed at dusk, most days.

I had a pretty sizable career shakeup last year and have decided to take the time to be choosy and work towards something I'm passionate about in my soul, rather than my ego-- or at least something more satisfying to its hunger. In the meantime, I'm working a day job that seems to test my fortitude but pays the bills and keeps time moving quickly.

I live in a weird part of America where summer smells like honeysuckle, mud, and rain-steam pavement.

I‚Äôm a worker bee and looking for someone to talk to, really¬†*talk to*¬†while I let my coffee grow cold in the morning or the rare late nights I‚Äôm awake and restless and wild‚Äî when I wish I were running barefoot through the grass.

Gin, bubbles, lime, and mint.

Working on living in the present, instead of regretting the past and mourning the future. Clawing the present back into my reach, really.

I'm looking forward to exploring the verdant landscape of getting to know someone. There is something uniquely exciting about watching the space between people grow and bloom as they connect and share experiences, stories, and conversations. The earth is never the same where they once stood.

Tell me about your favorite 2 am memory. Not the rowdy, bawdy story you barely remember-- but something when the stars were bright and your friends were all in love.

I'm not averse to chats, but longer DMs or emails are lovely as well-- or even a mixture of the two peppered with media. In a more practical sense, I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, or if I'm even looking. To seek is to know and certainty has never been my strong suit.

If anyone traveling around Patagonia or living here wants to help with the forest fires in El Bols√≥n, we could really use your support.

Our most urgent need is firefighter backpack pumps, but these cost over 200,000 pesos each. We have been gathering at Mystic Fog Beer Co. in Confluencia, which has become a base for supplies and has been providing food, water, and coffee to volunteers and firefighters. Every morning, we meet there and head up in trucks to do whatever we can to stop the fire from spreading.

We are in the process of setting up a GoFundMe, but in the meantime, you can send or drop off supplies at Cervecer√≠a Bratha in the center of El Bols√≥n (Av. San Mart√≠n 1517, R8430 El Bols√≥n, R√≠o Negro). You can also PM me for a Zelle or MercadoPago account, and I will order what‚Äôs needed.

Aside from firefighter backpack pumps, we also need gloves, eye protection, rakes, shovels, and other firefighting tools.

Anything helps!

I posted my daily diet on a workout sub, and the main food groups include;

\- Fresh fruits and vegetables

\- Low fat, high protein dairy (Greek yogurt, skim milk, cottage cheese)

\- Lean meats and proteins (chicken, salmon, tuna, eggs, almonds, beans)

\- Whole grains (oats, quinoa, whole wheat bread)

The biggest thing I seem to get criticized for is that apparently eating fresh fruit is ""high sugar"" and I should apparently be eating more high protein saturated fat foods (red meat, higher fat dairy, etc.) To me, ""high sugar"" is eating sweets, candy, adding sugar to your coffee or tea, eating highly processed sugary foods and drinks like soda and juice, etc. and not fresh fruit where the sugars break down more naturally in your body atop of provide additional benefits in the form of vitamins, minerals and fiber.

Furthermore, it sounds to me like people are chomping down on fatty dairy and red meats daily, and I just can't imagine that will be good for your health in the long run (and sounds very keto-ish, which two friends of mine who are very good dieticians have sworn up and down is not good for you.)

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \

I‚Äôm a 40 year old male in ga and girlfriend is 39. She has 2 kids and I have one. No kids were there during this incident. Tuesday, December 17 of last year I received a message from my girlfriend at 4:03 PM while I was at work saying I am having a pretty mental health day. I know this would lead to a bad situation based on our times before so after work, I planned on finishing up Christmas shopping. I wanted to call her to be sure we got everything but I didn‚Äôt call because kids were there and didn‚Äôt want them to hear us talking about it plus her having a bad mental health situation. I was just going to talk once I got back home upon returning home she asked why did I not respond to her message and I stated what message I then noticed on the way back home. She sent a message saying I‚Äôll leave you alone, but can you please tell me what have I done wrong? I told her who said you did anything wrong wrong what is wrong with you just tell me she stated I told you I‚Äôm having a bad mental health day and you should have came home and checked on me first. 

I told her that the kids were here so I know you would be OK until I got back and I will see what‚Äôs wrong. The conversation got heated, so I laid down to sleep. She got up, went into the kitchen, came back into 
The room and got into the bed with a bottle of pills and sat there Crying. I asked what are you doing with those and why are you crying? She said it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway I got up and went to sleep in the kids room because if I‚Äôm asking what‚Äôs wrong then tell me instead of that. I woke up about 630 next morning, expecting her to be at work already, but she was still there and we didn‚Äôt speak and I made my coffee and went to my car to smoke a cigar she left for work sometime after 7:25 AM which she usually leaves around 4:30 am. Wednesday same morning I got message saying I love you and always will. I‚Äôm sorry I messed your life up. I should have ran a long time ago. I replied stop messaging me with the BS. You want to do negativity then you can I won‚Äôt. I just paid the mortgage. Why not let me use the money to get my own place you sit around and take for me knowing you should have ran is selfish and leave me the  alone at 10:56 AM. She sends message saying she is quitting her job and I asked what does that have to do with me. She said never mind. I finish my day up at work and head home. Even though I had more Xmas shopping to do but I learned from day before. I got home around 5:30 PM and she is on the couch. Things are scattered around in the garage and kitchen. I asked what happened why is she laying on the couch learning words and in fetal position, she said, she kept falling coming in and knocked over things and that the paramedics were called by her mother because her daughter called her grandma bc she  was concerned with her, not being able to fully walk and falling down. She said she refused help and they left. 

I asked why you quit your job and she said her boss was being mean because she couldn‚Äôt work she couldn‚Äôt walk so she laid down in the back room all day and kept falling. I asked did you take those pills to try and kill yourself she said yes I wasn‚Äôt supposed to wake up. I was pissed but I still didn‚Äôt believe she took a whole bottle when she drove to work and back that day. I said come on get into bed. I‚Äôll help her get up and she kept falling to her knees, staggering over and over and collapsed again in front of the bed. A total of 3 times before we made it to the room. 

I helped her get undressed and put her in bed as I went to the kitchen. I begin to pick up items off the stove top that were scattered from her earlier. I noticed a letter and I read it was a suicide note written to me her daughter and son also her brother and sister-in-law number stating not to release medical records to them. while reading it I hear her stumbling around in the room, trying to make her way back up the hall I help her come to the kitchen. I asked her about the letter and I said I was gonna call your brother and see what he wants me to do. She said give me the letter and She then charged me going for the letter. I had it in one hand and keeping her from getting it. She begins to hit me with both hands and chest body and face. I‚Äôm holding her with one hand by bathrobe. She keeps falling down because she is weak from pills when she is down, she kicks me in my legs, punching me in my private area and yelling. I‚Äôm gonna call the cops. I told her she says I don‚Äôt care. She bites me multiple times on hand and arm police took photos the day I got taken to jail. I‚Äôm shoving her away and I finally let the letter go and she grabs it and tries to walk down the hall and falls again while on the floor she starts to rip the letter up so I don‚Äôt have proof to show police or her brother or what she is trying to do again again I try and help her get off the floor and she says it‚Äôs leave me alone she gets up and say I‚Äôm leaving grab keys and purse goes to car. I tell her don‚Äôt drive. I cut off car saying stop and come in. She doesn‚Äôt want to she lost her phone in the house so that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt pull off. she was only wearing a robe bra and underwear. 

I told her if something happens to you I couldn‚Äôt live with that on my heart. We walk back in and still fall before we get to the room we laid down together. I wake up for work Thursday morning and she is in bed at 6:30 AM with food smeared in bed so she got up while I was asleep but couldn‚Äôt eat properly because of all the pills so apparently she got up in the middle of the night to eat. her daughter walks in and checks on her. She comes over about 6:00 AM on days when she‚Äôs with her dad to catch the bus. She didn‚Äôt even know what day it was and was supposed to be working but was three hours late she called her boss and said I took a pill and I couldn‚Äôt wake up on time. Her daughter and I made some jokes about food being in bed. Her daughter leaves for school and I ask her. What else should I get from the store for groceries after work which is a Thursday and I always buy groceries on those days and ask about the gifts for Christmas, we talk a little bit, but she is still out of it better than days before but she is still feeling it. I asked her why she wanted to kill herself and she said life and why did not take the pills from her. I didn‚Äôt because she needs them so I won‚Äôt just take them and dump them and at that moment I wouldn‚Äôt think she would take all those to harm herself. 

I asked do you want me to take away every sharp thing out the house and dump all the pills you would be mad at me about that why kill yourself here and risk kids finding your body or me before I left I said if you want to kill yourself then go ahead because I can‚Äôt stop it. I go to work in a few hours later. I‚Äôll send a message to check on her and no response. I‚Äôll call eight times. No answer. I couldn‚Äôt leave work because of blackout time. I assume she is still upset. I get home about 5:30 and she was worried. I called again no answer so I went into the trash to get the note she ripped with her brother‚Äòs number and call him to ask for help and what should I do within minutes police pull up and arrest me sheriff and police. The arrest warrant was read to me at the sheriffs office and it stated I grabbed her by her ankles, pulling her and caused her to scrape knees, which wasn‚Äôt true days leading up to this she was crashing into her knees because she couldn‚Äôt stand and walk times before she would just collapse because of pots, which she had said it caused her to pass out and have seizures when standing up too fast or increased heart rate, she has woken up with bruises and scratches on her from fighting herself in her sleep or scratching heart certain meds she takes causes bruising for some reason and she doesn‚Äôt even know why I did notice some marks around her neck area that could have been caused by me holding her robe by the neck area during their attack, and if I caused those then I accept those she has a history of mental health issues being admitted to the hospital before she met me since being together, she has tried to harm herself from cutting her wrist and maybe taking pills I wasn‚Äôt sure but I believe she did. I was scared to get help because she is scared her ex will take the kids and because he has money and close with the police. She is worried that will happen. She has been emotionally unstable and violent from throwing and breaking things to self harm, threatening me and Herself.

I spend the night in jail. Paid 2000 to get out. We have stay away in place. Had bond review Jan 15th and judge and DA believes it should stay in place. She admitted I did none of those in the police report and she was so doped up she doesn‚Äôt know why but she was scared I was gonna call police, tell 17 year old daughter and her brother. So she tried to get me. We have talked since and been around each other even though we shouldn‚Äôt. But I do love her and I know she loves me and the kids love one another. She tried to go get charges dropped the same day actually but it‚Äôs not up to her. At the review she told the judge the truth and all he said ‚Äúsounds like it‚Äôs all your fault and not his which it isn‚Äôt. The worst I did was not come home Tuesday after work to check on her but I had my reason. 

I don‚Äôt have the funds for a lawyer and I still pay bills at our home but I‚Äôm not allowed there. If I go to trial I know they will throw the book at me. First offense, no criminal record. Even she went to DA office again but they don‚Äôt want to hear it. Arraignment isn‚Äôt until April and it‚Äôs killing us not being together and the kids. Then who knows when trial will start. I do not want to cop out to anything I didn‚Äôt do and she doesn‚Äôt either but we want to be together. 

I just need advice on what to do and just any help as needed. The only photos they have was extremely bruised knees and that‚Äôs because she was falling at work, and at home. And one scratch on neck which is on police report. Please help me!! ",1,1738722103.0,legal,3,1.0,False

I first noticed she liked me because whenever I walked into the cafeteria, she would find a reason to be near my station. Over time, we developed non-verbal signals‚Äîjust spotting each other from a distance to acknowledge that we had noticed each other.

Every interaction between us was subtle and discreet to avoid drawing attention from her coworkers. One day, I finally gathered the courage to ask her out for coffee. She said she would love to but was usually busy during the week, so I suggested Friday, and she agreed. She even gave me her number.

That evening, I tried calling her, but it turned out to be the wrong number. I thought maybe I had misheard it, so I tried different combinations, but none worked. Two days later, I walked in to grab a cup coffee. She was working at another section, but as soon as she saw me, she came over. I told her I had trouble reaching her. She repeated her number, and it turned out I had captured it correctly. It was just the wrong number. She seemed unsure of her own number. Since one of her coworkers was starting to notice, I quickly asked her to take my number instead and call me. That‚Äôs when we realized she had given me one wrong digit.

The next evening, I texted her to confirm if we were still meeting on Friday. She replied that she had caught a bad flu and was unlikely to make it. I wished her a speedy recovery and told her to take care. The following afternoon, I called to check on her. She sounded really sick, but we ended up having a great 25-minute conversation in my opinion. I asked about what she was taking for the flu and suggested a few remedies to help her recover faster. We also talked about our city and places outside the city where I could take her on weekends. The call ended on a good note.

The next morning, Sunday, around 11 AM, I texted her to ask how she had slept and how she was feeling. I also mentioned that I didn‚Äôt want to call in case she was resting. She replied almost immediately, saying she was feeling better, but her response felt a bit dry. I offered to send her Uber Eats so she wouldn‚Äôt have to cook, but she declined, saying she had already made pasta. After that, she completely ghosted me. Every attempt to reach her was ignored.

Two months later, I called her again on a Friday evening. Surprisingly, she answered on my second attempt. I was friendly and mentioned that I had tried reaching her several times. She responded by reminding me that she had told me she was always busy. She sounded annoyed that it was me. There was noise in the background, making me think she was at a restaurant. I asked her directly if she was interested in a relationship. She said we could talk about it another day, but she seemed irritated.

A month later, I tried calling and texting again, but I was ignored. Probably even blocked. After that, I stepped back completely. It has been months, and I have never reached out again. But now, whenever I walk into the cafeteria, she looks like she really dislikes me. To this day, I still don‚Äôt know what caused the sudden change in her attitude.",5,1738721902.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

He is certain that I made a huge error/was an asshole in our relationship and that I can't come back from this. I believe I may be the asshole as I didn't even consider it as a mistake at all. 

Background - My partner has issues in the past with cheating - it's been huge in his family and in his past relationships. I have not cheated on him in our relationship. I am friends with my ex of three years and I really enjoy that friendship and get a lot of career support from it - my mom is dead and the rest of my family live on the other side of the world so I may value friendships more than other. I am also unemployed right now and my ex is in the same industry. 

My boyfriend was anxious about this relationship as it was an ex and asked for reassurance. I gave it to him. I went to meet my ex for a coffee. My partner was very anxious about this - he was worried about how I would feel about my ex. He asked me for reassurance after coffee. I met my ex, it was great to chat career directions. He said would I like to come in and pick up some of my old books. I said yes, got the books. I immediately called my partner to reassure him that I love him and it further clarified he was my partner seeing my ex/being friends with my ex.

Later I was talking to my partner about my day and mentioned getting the books. He believed that this was a huge violation, and that nobody other than me would have gone into their ex's house without checking with their partner first. It never occurred to me to do that. He said that makes me an even bigger asshole that it didn't occur to me. 

I feel bad I was inconsiderate to his feelings as I wanted to make sure he never felt devalued in a relationship again. AITA?",3,1738721827.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

Hoping to hear from people close to our age. I‚Äôm 33(f), my fianc√© is 30(m), we‚Äôve been together about 7 years and recently decided to get married.

It came up in conversation with my friend that I don‚Äôt know how much money my fianc√© makes. When I asked him, he gave me a ballpark range, and was reluctant to tell me. The other day I overheard him on a call with a recruiter, and learned that he makes almost 3x as much as I do. He contributes about that much more than me in rent. Everything else is separate. We buy our own groceries and take turns buying things like toilet paper and soap. We rarely have dinner together or go on dates, but when we do we split the bill. If he picks up coffee creamer or something for me he sends me a Venmo request. 

The other day, my coworker said her son can‚Äôt date unless he has money to pay for it. I told her they could go on a free date, and she said she‚Äôs trying to teach him that it‚Äôs his responsibility to pay for things like that. I told her my fianc√© and I have always split the cost of dates, just like everything else, and she gave me a pitiful look, gave me a hug, and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù That‚Äôs not the first interaction I‚Äôve had like that with a coworker or friend, and it feels super awkward.

A girl in my derby league said ‚Äúyou split costs? What, does he have a magical d**k or something?‚Äù Little comments like this have me wondering if most couples our age don‚Äôt split costs. I really haven‚Äôt thought that much of it up until recently, noticing how other people think it‚Äôs so weird and we‚Äôre planning to get married. 

My fianc√© is pretty sure that my coworkers have an outdated way of thinking because most of them are our parents age, and couples our age split everything. He wants to keep it this way after getting married, unless maybe we have kids and I take time off work. 

I‚Äôd love to get opinions, if my friends and coworkers way of thinking is outdated, if the way we do it sounds normal or unhealthy.

TL;DR My fianc√© and I pretty much keep our finances separate, and my coworkers and friends have hinted that they feel sorry for me because of it. My fianc√© thinks their way of thinking is outdated, and it‚Äôs normal for couples in our generation to split everything equally, even when they‚Äôre married. Is this true?
