1m59lm7,https://i.redd.it/2z9wfqjym5ef1.jpeg,Tonight's two hour post prandial blood glucose,Tonight I ate three eggs mixed with heavy cream and scrambled in a skillet with ghee (clarified butter) topped with a tablespoon of olive oil after cooking. Then I cooked 2/3rd lb of ground beef with the leftover ghee in the pan.  My dessert was a little more than a tablespoon of coconut oil.  This is my two hour post prandial blood glucose.  I waited to drink my cold brew coffee with heavy cream and MCT oil until I checked this. I usually only eat 1/2 lb of ground beef with my eggs but was curious to see how 2/3rds would affect me.  Two hour post prandial still below 120 mg/dL.   ,1,1753072526.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

When things fell apart between my parents,
there was no explosion, no shouting.
Only a kind of dull silence that slowly took over everything.
And within that silence: Mom.
She was still there.
But smaller.
More tired in her movements.
As if she herself didn‚Äôt quite know where she now belonged in the house
that suddenly wasn‚Äôt their house anymore,
but a place full of things that no longer made sense.
And me?
I became something other than a child.
Not suddenly. But quickly.
I listened while she cried.
I took care of things while she trembled.
I asked about papers, real estate agents, furniture.
I had to take care of her.
Because she had always taken care of me.
We sold the house.
The family home.
My childhood, my room, the hallway where I slid in socks,
the smell of her shampoo in the morning.
I walked with her from room to room,
trying to keep her upright as she packed her entire past into boxes
that seemed too light to hold so many memories.
She looked at the window where Dad used to drink his coffee.
I looked at her face.
And I knew: this is a goodbye neither of us understands.
But I held her.
I was sixteen. Or seventeen.
Or just old enough to realize I was carrying things
that should never have been on my shoulders.
And yet I did it.

1m59cl7,https://i.redd.it/as10pmw6m5ef1.png,"Monster energy made me grow grey hairs at 23 years old, not a discouragement post but a warning","I love monster, they've got some of the best flavors ever from any brand and I love drinking and collecting them.

But they affected my health and induced added stress that wasn't there before, I didn't notice it but my body is starting to show early signs of it. So I have to leave it so I don't accidentally cause unnecessary ageing on my hair.

If it was one or two I'd chalk it up to a mere coincidence, but there's 5 already. (3 in the picture shown here)

It's actually scary that I check the roots of dark hairs and see some of them becoming grey, and this happening right when I'm 23 doesn't make sense since I've never had even one gray hair up until this year, unless you take into account that since December last year I started drinking monster energy sporadically (and almost daily since May)

I don't mean this as ""energy drinks are bad"", they're not, but caffeine is messy with iron absorption and the cortisol boost is too much for me even if I'm unstressed naturally. MY body reacts this way and it's probably a mix of the caffeine and the dormant genetical features that I've inherited from my parents being accelerated by it (my mom's hair started greying out at her late 30s and my dad's receeding hairline started in his early 30's)

By the way here's a medical study for reading if you want numbers on the topic, 42% of young men were found to be affected: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9824121/

What's weird is that these are not exactly ""grey"" hairs, they're more like a silver or platinated color, I almost thought it was the reflection of the light on the dark strands.

Also on other details, I don't smoke, don't drink alcohol, I live alone in a house and don't have to work, thanks to the saints that are my parents and the government to an extent (I'm just saying this to clarify there isn't work stress involved, I'm not proud of this fact and actively look for a job)

Also I don't drink normal coffee or any type of cappuccino, macchiato or any other source of caffeine, not even tea. Monster is the only source of caffeine I had for the last 7 months, and my hair started greying/silvering out.

Isolating sources of hair ageing, there can only be one natural one for me which is genetics from my parents, and there's no natural reason why I'd have such an early onset in my 20s with multiple strands silvering out, both my parents never had this and neither did my grandparents so there isn't a hidden gene here jumping to bite me unless my great great grandpa was Geralt of Rivia himself.

So I can logically point to energy drinks in this specific case and say they probably accelerated my hair ageing from already existing factors established by my parents.

If you drink monster and enjoy it that's great, I'm in that camp. But you gotta know that it could make you lose your hair or silver it out, among other things like weakening your bones (it's theorized it's a catalyst for osteoporosis)

However if you know that this can happen and accept it, be happy and drink monster! I wish I could do it but I like my hair too much.

Any kind of soda is bad for you and I don't drink them either, only Monster, but now it seems like I'll leave that too. Also I've only drank the zero variants and ultra series.

Anyway, hopefully this helps. I'll respond to comments and read if anyone has a better idea of what's happening/can explain things better.",4,1753071692.0,monsterenergy,6,0.64,False

I'm sure this may sound more complicated than it actually is. See I was working at this local mom and pop restaurant for the last couple of months and after being unemployed for a few months. While I am grateful that this place helped to get me back on my feet, I didn't realize how miserable it would make me. There were a lot of red flags working at this place, red flags that I wonder if I should have warned some of the perspective employees who came in for interviews over the last week or so.

Here at the list of Red Flags.

1. After my interview with the owner, I told him I would have to think a bout his potential offer because I had interviews in two other restaurants that are about 20-40 minutes away from this restaurant. He said ""I'm going to be sending you a job offer today. Would it make you a real jerk if you didn't go all the way out there for those interviews?"" To me this is a huge red flag because I made a commitment to those restaurants. I had no official offer and even if I did, these places carved out time in their day to meet with me. I felt I had to follow through with the commitment. 

2. He said he would send me the offer that day but didn't send it for three days. 

3. He hired me to cross-train as a server and barista but only trained me for a day as a barista and then expected me to be perfect at my job. 

4. Every time I messed up at the job, a chipped mug, not making enough foam for a latte, it was the end of the world.

5. He micromanaged. We baristas were constantly being scrutinized and judged for how long it would take to make drinks. We had to grind the beans each time, steam the milk, and there were many flavors of lattee between powders and syrups, not to mention the pictures that could be printed on them. When it was busy it could take up to 20 minutes to complete and order.

6. The drinks would pop up on a screen but he was so cheap that he didn't have the system set up to print receipts for the drinks after we made them. We would literally have to yell ""drink runner"" then wait to bump the drinks until a server would take the coffees because we had to tell them every single coffee on the order and what table it should be ran to. 

7. He would get upset at servers not running drinks fast enough but without a ticket to tell servers were the drinks needed to go, it made it harder on them, and harder on us. A stupid little piece of paper would have made it much more efficient. Servers would see the paper and know exactly what everything was and where it would go without having to ask the baristas and waste our time. 

8. On the days I was ""support"" for back of house, I would get yelled at for not rolling up silverware fast enough so we could get off the wait list, but I was also getting yelled at for not getting water glasses out fast enough either and having water orders be on a 10 minute wait.

9. When I was barista and made a mistake, he'd yell at me in front of customers.

10. He threatens to make servers pay for the uniform HE provides if we don't stay our full 90 days, something that goes against the California Labor laws. 

11. The tip pool was an even 50/50 split between all front of house and back of house staff. I don't mind sharing tips with back of house, I do mind when it is that much. I also mind sharing tips with servers who do the bare minimum or less and get an average tip and I go above and beyond and get a larger one. If I get a 35% tip for giving outstanding service why am I sharing it with the server who does the bare minimum and gets a 20% or less tip?

12. He had me train as a server, then gave me a section and spot on the floor, saying I was done training then a week later puts me back into training. 

It felt like I could do nothing right at this place and while I liked all my co-workers (all who complain but stay because they need the job), I hated the owner. I often tried to find one good thing about him, one good quality, but I couldn't. I still can't. 

I also realize that I am saying all this from my perspective and he may have a different view on all this, as well as what others who own restaurants think and feel, but for me...well...maybe it is because all this is still fresh in my mind and I am still comprehending all that I had endured recently or maybe I just always felt this way and bottled it up because I don't like to be honest with myself. Either way, I'm not trying to be a victim or say things were right or wrong. I just had to get this off my chest. 

I put my two weeks in because I have a better opportunity at a better restaurant but I got ""fired"" because they learned how unhappy I was. I'm not sure how I feel, but I guess I am a little mad that he didn't care enough to ask why I was unhappy. He has a high turn over rate of employees.

1m590dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1m590dg/my_ex_pastor_is_using_church_funds_to_pay_off/,My ex pastor is using church funds to pay off personal tax debts and is getting away with it,"I recently left my very small church because I found some liens that lead me to believe that the pastor has been evading taxes for 5 years and is in debt over 600k to the IRS. 

After some weird situations that caused me to be suspicious, I did a background check on my pastor. I figured out how to conduct a public record lien search and found 11 of them - all together totaling around $600,000. These liens were from evading taxes on his failed personal business separate from the church.


This church is very small and I was very close with his family and their friends. I found out in 2023 his bank account got completely leveraged by the IRS.  Apparently, one of our friends had opened up a bank account under the pastor‚Äôs name before he turned 18. Fast forward to a warm sunny day in 2023, he woke up to his bank account at $0. He had to work hard to prove to the IRS that he was not connected to the pastor and got his money back. I was one of the very few people who knew that this happened.

Later that year, the pastor and his family moved into a nicer rental house, in a nicer area, and it didn‚Äôt make sense to me because they had just lost all of their money. I was told that the pastor was given a raise to about 100k per year because he was in some financial trouble and that‚Äôs what he needed to continue working as a pastor. I became extremely suspicious because there was no way this church was bringing in enough money to support that kind of salary. This church was his only source of income since he had to shut down his personal business. 

When I say he was ‚Äúgiven a raise‚Äù, I mean, he gave himself a raise. The ‚Äúboard‚Äù of that church consists of about three men who are very close to him. This church is not elder lead, and the pastor never wanted to merge with another church when the congregation rapidly shrunk after covid. The congregation is about 30 to 50 people on a good Sunday. They have been meeting at a temporary location. 
 
The church is currently building a building on a plot of land that they own. They had knocked down their previous building before the pandemic, and are building a new one that is more modern. With grants and loans, charitable donations, and money they got from selling a portion of the land, they have spent around $10 million so far building this new building. They just started a go fund me for 1 million dollars so they can finish the building project. Yes, they are e-begging for a million dollars on social media so they can finish this building. They are using phrases like ‚Äúalmost there!‚Äù and ‚Äújust the last 15%!‚Äù to make it seem like a million dollars is not a big ask from the general public in this economy. 

The church is in so much debt and is so tiny, I never understood why they decided to move forward with this building project when the church didn‚Äôt have enough money to do it. When I found out about his $600,000 of debt, I realized it‚Äôs because this is his only option. His only option is to become a pastor of a nicer larger more modern church so that he can make more money and pay off his debt without anyone batting an eye. 

This entire situation infuriates me. Nobody in the congregation knows about the pastor‚Äôs financial situation. Nobody seems to be questioning why the church is making such a grotesque financially irresponsible decision with this building project. Going millions and millions of dollars into debt and saying that is God‚Äôs plan. They are just blindly following their leader. Seeing them ask for donations to their GoFundMe every day on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok is making me lose my mind. They really need a basketball court and a coffee shop so they can bring people to Jesus for 12 million dollars, when they could have just merged with another church - oh wait they can‚Äôt merge with another church. How would the pastor pay off his debt that way?

So, my daily thoughts are: how is this guy not in jail? How is he paying off the IRS? How are they going to keep this church running if they ever get the funds to complete the building project, because a building of that size costs millions yearly to upkeep? How is everyone this blind?

1m58zls,https://i.redd.it/0sjjwaspi5ef1.png,"You're Dead to Me, Darling","

I saw my husband, John Sullivan, at a bar, three months after he'd supposedly gone missing in a skiing accident.

With his arm around that so-called girl buddy, he was laughing out loud. ""Thank God for your idea. I almost forgot what freedom felt like.""

His buddies kept raising their glasses, cheering him on and asking when he'd show up.

He looked down and thought for a moment. ""Maybe in a week. I'll show up once she's gone totally crazy looking for me.""

I stood in the shadows, watching him bask in his freedom. Then I called a friend who worked at the county clerk's office.

""I've decided to cancel John's identity record.""

""Not looking for him anymore?"" my friend asked, hesitating.

I looked over at John, who was whispering to Nancy Shawn, my eyes stinging. My voice caught. ""He can't be found.""

If someone wants to stay hidden, what's the point in finding them anyway?

I hung up and went back to the private room.

My best friend saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand.

""Wennie, John's been missing for three months. There's almost no chance he's alive. You need to move on.""

I looked down at the colorful drink, then knocked it back.

The burn hit hard and brought tears to my eyes. I blinked fast, holding back the ache. ""Would someone really fake their disappearance just to fool their wife?""

She gave me a hard stare. ""What the hell are you saying? Anyone who'd do that is trash. Might as well be dead.""

I wiped my tears and grabbed my purse from the couch.

""You're right. It's time I let John go.""

Then I turned and left, heading home.

The house was as quiet as always. I'd grown to fear the silence over the past three months. Every time I came home, I'd turn on all the lights, brew the coffee he liked, and leave it on the table, pretending he was still here.

I didn't get it. If he didn't want to be with me anymore, he could've just divorced me. Why fake a skiing accident and go missing?

Sitting on the couch, I picked up the figurines of us on the table.

Back then, John leaned against me, smiling as he pointed at them. ""When I'm not around, let these two keep you company.""

That voice from the past overlapped with what I heard in the bar today‚Äîhis irritated tone.

""Wennie used to be sweet and gentle. But after we got married, I don't know what happened‚Äîshe got so clingy. Faking my death is kind of a lesson for her. Maybe next time she won't be so attached.""

Next to him, Nancy poured him another drink. ""See how good I am? We've been friends for years, and I never cling to you.""

""Right. You're my best buddy.""

They talked like buddies, but their legs were tangled together.

Just thinking about it made me sick.

I tossed the figurines into the trash and grabbed my phone. I sent out a broadcast message.

""John passed away three months ago. The funeral is to be held next week.""

Almost instantly, his so-called buddies started flooding me with messages.

""He's not even found yet. How can you hold a funeral?""

""Wennie Castillo, are you insane? John's not dead!""

""If he comes back and sees his own funeral, he'll blow up! Are you sure you want to make him mad?""

I ignored the first few and only replied to the last one.

""He's dead. What's there to be mad about?""

I put down my phone and started packing up John's things.

For the past three months, I'd barely been home‚Äîmost of my time was spent searching for him in that snowy mountain town.

The bedroom looked pretty much the same.

But when I opened the closet, I froze.

More than half his clothes were gone. The ones left were for the wrong season.

My tears fell instantly, and I let out a bitter laugh.

I'd been living up on that mountain, desperate to find him. Only came home when I really couldn't take it anymore.

But during those same days‚Äîwhile I was falling apart‚ÄîJohn had quietly come home more than once just to take his stuff.

Chapter 2

I pulled up the home security footage and fast-forwarded through the past month.

Early in the month, John walked in with his arm around Nancy. Two hours later, he left with a pile of clothes.

Mid-month, he carried her in bridal style into the house. They didn't leave until the next morning.

Just two nights ago, they slipped in under the cover of darkness and left yesterday at dawn.

All those times, I'd been in another city, desperately searching for him.

My tears kept falling as I watched‚Äînot for John, but for myself.

I gave everything for someone this disgusting.

He wasn't worth it!

While I was losing sleep, worrying if he was alive or dead, he was in my house, with her. Maybe even in my bed.

I gripped the edge of the table, trying not to sob until I couldn't breathe.

My phone, tossed in the living room, started ringing.

I didn't want to answer, but whoever it was kept calling, over and over.

I took a deep breath and walked over.

The caller ID made me pause. I picked it up fast. ""What's wrong, Harvey?""

""John's not dead.""

Right after, he sent me a video.

I opened it. In the clip, John and Nancy were linking arms, sipping wine like newlyweds, their eyes locked like no one else existed.

My breath caught. My hand shook as I whispered, voice trembling, ""I know he's not dead.""

He was silent for a beat, then chuckled.

""And you're still throwing him a funeral?""

""Everyone told me he was dead. I believed them. So yeah‚ÄîI'm giving him a funeral.""

Harvey Sullivan paused. ""Widowed, huh?""

I replied with a soft ""Yeah.""

Harvey was John's uncle by title, no blood relation. We barely crossed paths.

He was the first to tell me John wasn't really dead, and I owed him for that.

""Harvey, if you're free, you can come pay respects in seven days.""

""I will.""

Right after, he sent me a video.

Someone besides John held up a phone to show him something. He suddenly smashed his wine glass.

Nancy, beside him, flinched. She placed a hand on his chest, saying something to calm him down.

The bar was noisy‚ÄîI couldn't hear.

But I saw his face soften, even bury into her shoulder.

He must've seen the broadcast message I sent and lost it. I just didn't expect a few words from Nancy could calm him down so easily.

Back then, whenever he got mad at me, he'd make me reflect all night and apologize, and only then might he forgive me.

I shut my stinging eyes and saved both videos.

Just as I was about to put down my phone, Nancy called.

I answered. Music blared in my ear.

She yelled, ""Wennie, are you holding a funeral for John? Are you out of your mind?

""I'm telling you, cancel it! Or you'll be dead when John gets back!""

I hung up mid-sentence, grabbed a blanket, curled up on the couch, and slept.

It was the best sleep I've had in three months.

The next morning, I brought my ID and canceled John's identity record.

After that, I went to Nancy's place.

The door stayed shut. I rang again and again until she finally opened.

She stood in a thin silk robe, leaning on the doorframe, traces of intimacy running from her neck downward.

""Oh, it's you. What do you want?""

I glanced from her neck to her face and met her mocking gaze.

""I want you at John's funeral. You were his close friend, after all.""

She rolled her eyes, voice sharp. ""Wennie, you're his wife! He's not dead‚Äîthere's no body. You're not even looking for him, and you're holding a funeral?

""What if he's still alive? Are you cursing him to die? What kind of wife does that?""

I pulled out the death certificate I'd just gotten and laughed softly. ""Three months buried in snow. I couldn't find him. He's officially declared dead.

""Weren't you the ones who told me to move on?""

When the bad news came, I fainted on the spot.

Woke up the next morning with all his so-called buddies gathered around my bed.

""Wennie, the place where John went missing is rough. Might be best to let go.""

""Yeah, it's way too dangerous. Better not go.""

I forced myself up, bought a ticket, hired a rescue team, and went straight into the mountains.

Fifteen days. No sleep. Searching nonstop.

Back then, I didn't notice‚Äînone of those buddies had even a trace of worry in their eyes. Only amusement.

Right then, a loud bang came from inside Nancy's room.

Her face changed. She glared. ""Wennie, don't pull any stunts! John won't let you off when he's back!""

I ignored her, like last night.

She shot me a death glare and slammed the door in my face.

Chapter 3

The shouting inside the room reached my ears.

John must've heard his identity record was canceled‚Äîhe finally snapped.

But there was no way I was letting him find me.

He disappeared for three months. A few days of my vanishing wasn't too much to ask.

I grabbed my pre-packed suitcase and asked my best friend to book a hotel under her ID, seven days.

I spent those days either buying funeral supplies or hiding in that hotel.

When my best friend came to visit, she looked gleeful.

""Word is someone's gone mad looking for you. About to tear all of Los Angeles apart.""

I glanced at the missing person ad on TV and smirked. ""So what if he does? If I don't want to be found, he won't find me. Didn't he say back then he'd only show up after I'd lost my mind searching? What, can't hold back now?""

""Serves him right! I swear, what kind of monster even does that?""

She kept cursing, getting more worked up. I quickly stopped her. ""Don't. Today's my husband's funeral. I should be grieving.""

I pulled out my makeup bag, covered my flushed skin with foundation, and painted on a look of grief.

After confirming with her that I looked convincingly wrecked, we headed to the venue together.

On the way, I handed her a USB with the video proof that John was alive. I told her when to play it‚Äîshe'd follow my signal.

Only after everything was in place did I send out the funeral location to everyone.

Harvey arrived first, dressed in a black suit. He walked straight up to me, took the ribbon, and pinned it on his chest, murmuring a solemn, ""My condolences.""

Next came a stream of clueless relatives and friends.

Their grief was real. My heart ached just watching.

""John, you faked your disappearance. Do you know how many people you hurt?

""Today, you'll pay for it‚Äîbit by bit,"" I said inwardly.

Then came his so-called buddies.

Each one looked worse than the last. Their hands were shaking as they took the ribbons from me.

Finally, one of them pulled me aside.

""Wennie! You have to stop this! John's not dead! He's been losing his mind looking for you! Haven't you seen the missing person ads on TV?""

I blinked slowly and forced out two tears.

""Don't comfort me. I know‚ÄîNancy posted that missing person ad.

""The dead don't come back. I'm done hoping he's alive.""

He tried to say something else, but I shot my best friend a look. She quickly pulled him to a seat.

Once the place was full, I stepped up to the mic.

""Thank you all for coming to my late husband's funeral...""

Before I could finish, a scream cut through the air.

""Wennie! Are you insane? I told you John isn't dead!""

Nancy stood at the entrance, eyes sharp and hateful.

""Are you even really his wife? He's only been missing for three months! No body, no nothing‚Äîand you're holding a funeral? I won't allow it!""

I looked behind her. No sign of John.

Even now, he wouldn't show himself.

I looked down at her, voice cold. ""You won't allow it? Who are you to say that? You said it yourself‚ÄîI'm his wife.""

Her eyes widened, tears welling up. ""How can you be so cruel? John loved you so much, and you just declared him dead like it's nothing?

""What if he's still alive?""

My eyes dropped to the marks still visible on her neck. I smiled and said, ""Even if he is, a cheating man isn't worth my time.""

With that, I had someone pull her aside and resume the funeral.

Just as I opened my mouth to speak, a disheveled, thin man appeared at the door.

He choked out, ""I'm not dead, honey. I'm back.""

Tbh, I was probably a touch optimistic in my original appraisal. To be fair the comparison of this home brew to my normal English blend is like comparing a Macka's Cheeseburger to a Fillet Mignon, but such are the affordability limitations of a poor man lol.

That said, I'm about ready to try take 2 on the blend.

Keeping with the philosophy that less is more, the challenge is twofold:  
\- Keeping the flavour acceptable  
\- Slowing the burn  
Therefore my next foray will cut down the experimental additions further.

Step 1. Prepare the sauce: Molasses with cold drawn ground coffee & a slug of whiskey

Step 2. Let the baccy air in a dry spot for a week

Step 3. Add sauce till the tobacco has a tacky consistency (not drenched) and add a fair amount of Lapsang tea-leaves for the smokey vibe. Kneed the lot. Add a dusting of coffee powder (straight from the packet) for good measure and kneed it some more.

Step 4. Press it for 2 - 3 days. I use a stainless steel bay-maree, cover the layer of tobacco with baking paper and lay 2 planks over the top and put my sons kettle-bell weights on it. works a treat.  
The mix should be a leathery consistency by this stage.

Step 5. Air dry.

Step 6. Do a rough grind of whole cloves if you want more of a sweet spicey vibe, or not if you want the closest approximation to an English blend (keeping in mind Cheeseburger reference).

1m58ybg,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1m58ybg/parents_as_a_young_adult/,Parents as a young adult,"I'm quite lost with my parents since I've turned 18.

A lot has changed in the first few months of being 18. I just got my first job (well paid for an 18 year old, not great for middle-aged but for now it's good), and they are already expecting rent and food and bills. It's not like I am not responsible with money. I save 80% of what they don't take. Currently I'm saving for driving license, exams, car, and eventually a down payment on a house. In my opinion I don't think that's fair. Maybe a little but they charge a good amount.

Beside from money they are also being insufferable with interesting rules. 

For example; bedtimes. My parents get mad at me, calling me all kinds of names when I stay up late. My work schedule ranges from a 10am start to a 1pm start throughout the week. I've been sleeping at around 1 or 2am on the days I start later. I know this isn't a good habit but I don't think its fair for my parents to enforce rules on it when I'm an adult now? I'm respectful of the noise and barely ever leave my room accept for to grab water. Their phrase is always ""my house my rules""

Another rule is eating in my room. They don't allow me to eat in my room. I've mentioned that after a long day of work I don't want to have to sit in a lonely dining room, I just want to wind down in my room. The same phrase comes back ""my house, my rules"" Our family never have meals together so it's not like I'm missing out on family time. Our house is kind of a ""fend for urself"" food wise. Hence I want to just make food and take it to my room. This has also pushed to some weight loss (which is good but also concerning the amount I have lost), because after a long day at work I'd rather just grab some crisps and eat them watching netflix etc. Which ofc now I can't do so I end up just forgetting to eat.

Another one is cleaning, specifically my room. I wouldn't say my room is the worst, just a few things here and there, but my parents expect my room to look like a hotel after the weekly cleaning. They set a weekly Sunday ""cleaning day"" where all their children needs to clean their rooms. I work 6 days a week, Sunday is my only rest day. So most of the time I really can't be bothered to clean. It's not a hazard, and my parents are NEVER in my room so I don't see a problem with the bed not being made, or a cup of coffee on my desk that I'm drinking. Or a few books misplaced. Etc. Silly things like that. They set a date and time and say they will ""inspect it"" at that time. It always needs to be fully hoovered and mopped and completely clean. I find this crazy and really annoying.

There's another few rules which I find ridiculous, but these are the main three that have been causing the most problems and arguments. My problem is the name-calling, ofc I try not to let it get to me but when I'm getting called useless, worthless, selfish, spoiled, etc. it gets to me. But maybe I am just being a little girl that needs to grow up I'm not sure I just need some perspectives.

Ik there's not really much I can do because it kinda is their house - so I guess their rules.

 I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this? I also want to know if I'm being a spoiled and selfish brat like they are saying, or if my thinking is correct? ",1,1753070441.0,youngadults,1,1.0,False

1m58wqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dodge/comments/1m58wqw/3_months_with_my_charger_daytona_ev/,3 months with my Charger Daytona EV," I've had the Charger Daytona EV Coupe for about 3 months, and my findings are pretty clear. Its not a muscle car, but it is a near luxury GT with the looks of a muscle car. Which I personally really appreciate after owning different 13 cars up until this point. BUT I think that Dodge's sole failure with this car (that they are claiming that they shall rectify with the hurricane I6) is that they simply did not provide enough choice. There should have been an ICE variant for their huge customer base who prefer's ICE cars, and an EV for those of use are not attached to the ICE car concept, like myself as we are clearly in the minority. Why cultivate such a huge following, but not continue to embrace them with every new model? Not everyone can adapt to electrification so easily, and not everyone can basically pay double for what is presented as the same model that you had one sale for over a decade prior.  However, I am happy that they are showing that  can as more than just jelly beans on the road. They can exist in the form of regular looking cars that we know and adore. In that respect, Dodge has broken a barrier and truly succeeded. 

In terms of IRL speed/performance, The variant I have an (r/t w/sport pack)  is typically on the faster end of cars in traffic. People who have a general idea of this model assume its slow because the 24' MY cars were under developed but the 25 'MY cars seem to be much better.I haven't had an electrical issue or warning yet, my range is actually averaging 30. I have level 2 charger at home (free charger and install from the dealer) and a fast charger at work. I have saved about 400$ in fuel prices per month. The only cars that seem to best it are cars that cars 3-4x more, such as my neighbor's 911 gt3 RS (he gave me a thumbs up after we got the red light and said finally a sexy EV), and this one highly modified Mustang GT which later caught me at Costco parking lot and stated he was actually impressed that despite his mods it was only 1 car length behind.

 It also gets alot of looks stares. People follow me in traffic and ask me questions about it. Other EV owners even flash me in approval and give me positive looks/gestures. A former supervisor of mine even told me that he ""lusted after it"" after seeing it in person in our underground garage. It has even gotten more attention than the literal deluge of Porsche 911s that are always at my local cars and coffee in the SW. This can be a good or bad thing depending on the type of person you are and how social you may be. I am presently indifferent to the attention but I am glad it receives positive feedback, even from those who are more car-conscious, better than people raising pitchforks.

All of the tech, excluding the nav of course, works as intended. Even the tailgate gets it right.I am going to reiterate my earlier point though and say that I do empathize with traditional dodge enthusiasts, this would be great as an ICE car as well. However, throughout the history of Dodge, they have never really followed the rules so to speak. 

I think of this as a car that is part of that same ethos, but the freedom of choice in terms of powertrain  is where I stand a bit disappointed on this one. I want Dodge to learn from their mistakes and lean on what they do well, but also keep attempting to step forward with electrification but in small measurable ways such as a limited run or just a few trims of each model as an EV  (such as the volume and perhaps not performance oriented trims) so that the rest of their lineup can stay as modern as this Charger Daytona is while still being in step with what the consumers desire.  BMW basically is doing this and despite the very questionable styling, the products do sell well where I am. I see alot of IXs, i4s, I5s, and I7s in my neighborhood, and I see just as many of their ICE counterparts as well. 

My verdict is that I will be keeping it to the end of its lease (major mechanical/electrical issues notwithstanding), and should there be a Scat Pack that does 0-60 in 3 seconds or less at that point, I shall pivot to that model. I wont be totally without an ICE car for long though, as a Viper will be joining this car in my garage around Christmas, so if I ever miss the best of Dodge's Catalog, I will only be a set of car keys away.

I know that people will typically either buy certain things and get to keep what they bought, or all split the cost of everything and just figure out who gets what at the end of the year. 

Here is the situation: I already have an extra couch, coffee table, two big chairs, and some decor that I am not using at home that I offered to bring up to the apartment. My roommate, let‚Äôs call her Roommate #1, bought a TV for the apartment. Roommate #3 has not yet contributed (not her fault, we haven‚Äôt talked about this all together yet. Right now I‚Äôm just trying to brainstorm ideas to propose when we do discuss). We still have to buy a good amount of things like a TV stand, lamp/lighting, dining table and chairs, a rug, and whatever decor we might want. 

Since me and Roommate #1 have already contributed in some way, should we have Roommate #3 buy something that is somewhat equal to what we are bringing and then split the rest? Or should we continue to just individually buy things for the apartment? What is another fair way we can divvy up costs so that one person would not contribute more or less than another? 

Also, how should we split things when it comes to costs of kitchenware, like plates, utensils, pots/pans, knives? Should we all just bring our own? 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated ü§çü§ç

1m58ui1,https://i.redd.it/6aya3q5fh5ef1.png,"Fellow students, how do you interpret mixed signals in texts? Built something that might help","Hey everyone,

Junior CS major here. Like many of you, I've been overthinking texts from someone I'm interested in. You know the classic ""I'll let you know"" or ""maybe we can study together sometime"" messages that leave you wondering what they REALLY mean.

This semester has been especially confusing with mixed signals from a classmate. One day they're super friendly in our study group, next day their texts are... cryptic?

As a coding project (and honestly, for my own sanity), I created an AI tool that analyzes conversation tone and hidden meanings. It breaks down:

* Emotional percentages (Interest, Affection, etc.)
* What they might actually be thinking
* Relationship temperature
* Suggested responses

Tested it on my own convos and... yeah, sometimes the truth hurts üòÖ But it's been helpful for understanding social dynamics better, especially for someone like me who tends to overanalyze everything.

If anyone wants to try it: [https://betweentone.vercel.app/](https://betweentone.vercel.app/)

I moved to Vancouver from Ontario (GTA) last April to be with my bf after doing long distance for about a year after uni (i studied at Western!). It‚Äôs been a bit tough making friends who are around my age (that aren‚Äôt my bfs friends) and it‚Äôs been a bit depresso leaving everyone who i was close with at home to move here. 

We currently live in Coal harbour so ideally looking for people (females) who are within the downtown area - doesn‚Äôt have to be on this side of the city as I love to walk :) 

Speaking of walking, I am really into walks (long hot girl walks on the weekend or after work), hiking, pretty much anything to do with outdoors, but i also love the gym. I also love going to try new restaurants, love a cute cocktail bar, and i am super into cooking so girl dinner parties, picnics, whateva, is üë©‚Äçüç≥üíã.

This was my first time trying a Gesha after seeing so much hype online; and honestly, it lives up to every bit of it. Total flavor bomb: notes of honey, caramel, tropical fruits and incredibly clean. No bitterness or harshness at all. Just delicious.

That said, the roast date is a bit old (June 30, 2025), and I noticed they still had quite a few bags left. The barista mentioned the beans would be at their best for maybe another week before they start to lose some of their magic. Kinda made me sad thinking all these incredible beans might not get the love they deserve.

If you‚Äôre in the area, maybe consider dropping by and grabbing a bag? They also have this Gesha on their pour-over menu, so you can try it before committing. Would hate to see these go to waste.

Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: End The Coffee-Cup Cookie Cycle‚ÄîProbiotic Yogurt & Omega Hacks,"**Fenugreek Vs. Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: End The Coffee-Cup Cookie Cycle‚ÄîProbiotic Yogurt & Omega Hacks**

In the quest for healthier living, many individuals find themselves caught in the cycle of energy consumption and sugar-laden snacks. The ""coffee-cup cookie cycle"" becomes a daily struggle. However, incorporating alternatives like fenugreek and supplements such as Force Factor Test X180 Gummies offers a path toward more balanced nutrition.

Fenugreek, a versatile herb, is renowned for its myriad health benefits including improved digestion and hormonal balance. It acts as a natural appetite suppressant, helping to curb those mid-morning cookie cravings that typically accompany your caffeine fix. By integrating fenugreek into your diet, you can support metabolic health and stabilize blood sugar levels, which is crucial for anyone looking to break free from unhealthy eating patterns.

On the other hand, Force Factor Test X180 Gummies serve as an excellent dietary supplement, crafted to support testosterone levels naturally. The blend of vitamins and herbal ingredients not only enhances energy but also alleviates the fatigue that often leads to poor food choices. Combining these gummies with a daily routine can help you reclaim your vitality, allowing you to approach nutrition with a new mindset.

For optimal gut health, pairing these strategies with probiotic yogurt can yield impressive results. The probiotics support digestion and enhance nutrient absorption, complementing the benefits of fenugreek and Test X180 Gummies. Furthermore, adding omega-rich foods such as fatty fish or flaxseed can enhance brain function, offering an all-rounded approach to wellness.


    Fenugreek: Natural appetite suppressant, aids digestion.
    Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: Supports testosterone, boosts energy.
    Probiotic Yogurt: Promotes gut health, aids digestion.
    Omega-Rich Foods: Enhances brain function and overall well-being.


By leveraging the benefits of fenugreek and Force Factor Test X180 Gummies, combined with probiotics and omega-rich foods, you can successfully break the cycle of unhealthy snacking and foster a sustainable approach to your health.

No accountability, constant accusations, emotional outbursts, total denial of reality. I could show her clear evidence of something, and she‚Äôd just flat-out deny it or twist it into something completely delusional. I‚Äôm always the one who reflects, who comes back, who apologizes, even when I‚Äôm not the one in the wrong. In four years, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever once said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or admitted to being wrong. Not once. It honestly feels like dealing with a five-year-old sometimes. Every serious conversation turns into her crying, storming off, slamming doors, or flipping out. Every time I try to ask for a conversation she refuses, I don‚Äôt want to attack I just want to have a conversation to help us figure out our differences and to strengthen our relationship and I stress that to her everytime. Still, she refuses and goes straight to attack mode. 

Last September it all hit a breaking point after months of the same exhausting cycle. I‚Äôd get accused of cheating because a random girl walked through the background of a picture I took. Couldn‚Äôt go to work, get coffee, or even take a bike ride without being questioned about who I was really with. It got insane. I snapped, we broke up. But like always, I was the one who eventually reached back out, apologized for my part, and tried to fix things.

We started talking again in January and have been off and on since then, but nothing‚Äôs changed. I‚Äôve told her a million times‚ÄîI don‚Äôt need perfection, I just need effort. I just need some accountability, even a little bit of honesty. But she can‚Äôt do it. Every time I try to sit down and have a real conversation, it turns into chaos. She either breaks down or attacks, and nothing gets resolved.

And it‚Äôs not just with me. She‚Äôs had the same issues with her parents, exes, bosses, and friends. Everyone in her life has given her this same feedback, but she refuses to hear it. She won‚Äôt even acknowledge that there‚Äôs a problem, let alone try to work on it.

I still love her. I honestly think she needs help, and part of me feels bad for her. Like maybe I can be the one to help her or fix it. But deep down I know I can‚Äôt. She doesn‚Äôt want to look in the mirror. She doesn‚Äôt want to change.

We are fighting again over literal scenarios that do not exist except in her head and I‚Äôm being punished by being ghosted, removed from IG and her adding a bunch of dudes and putting pictures up to piss me off. Psychological warfare to punish me over stuff that did not even happen. For doing everyday normal things to enjoy my life and then being distorted and twisted into some worst case scenario that involves me being shady or doing things I shouldn‚Äôt. None of which exist. She‚Äôs mad because instead of sitting home by myself while I‚Äôm in her doghouse I‚Äôm just living my life this time. 

If anyone‚Äôs been through something like this, I could really use advice. How do you walk away from someone you love when you know staying is only destroying your mental and emotional health?",4,1753068895.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

The family that I rehomed her with (last led 5 months) gave her up and I got her back. 

She‚Äôs still aggressive with unfamiliar other dogs and humans, denning/digging when she hears a loud noise that turns into total destruction. Shes crated in an oversized exotic animal cage because she‚Äôll scratch and chew out the plastic bottoms of any conventional crate. 

BUT the issue that makes her nearly intolerable is the whining. She whines all the time. Not constantly but multiple times per day for 20+ minutes. I happen to believe it‚Äôs for attention because although I try to ignore it for the most part when I do give her attention, it ceases. She‚Äôll whine if she‚Äôs tied up a few feet away, whine when she‚Äôs on a leash and I‚Äôm sipping a coffee outside the cafe, or whine in the car where she‚Äôll whine for well over an hour. 

It‚Äôs not purely separation either it seems. She‚Äôll crate and keep quiet when I leave now. She‚Äôll stay in the car for hours without making any noise. 

But when we‚Äôre together she will be relentless and it makes it extremely hard not to resent her existence. And boy, I‚Äôm really trying with this dog. She‚Äôs bit enough at this point that most wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye if she were surrendered or worse, euthanized.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3 years, we met when I worked at his father's restaurant he was helping open at the time. 


I was at the end of a long relationship with my ex where I had my son who is now 4. It was really rough at the time but he offered to help get me back on my feet, even moved out of his parents house so we could get a place together.

We had discussed early in the relationship that I eventually did want more kids, and he agreed, he really wanted to be a father and was doing well with my son at the time aswell. As we planned I got pregnant and had a second boy last year...but that day still haunts me.

We had some complications and my son ended up footling breech with a scheduled c section, I wanted to book ASAP, but as he still had work to do (being a self employed contractor) he wanted to push that day back. We pushed it back as far as the doctor was comfortable, and my boyfriend worked long hours up until that week, sometimes coming home and falling asleep in his truck till 2am.

The day my water broke was after one of those nights, it was about 8am and my older son was uo and being kinda loud. I had decided to go for a walk and bring my boyfriend back some coffee as I knew he was working hard and this was technically our last day before the scheduled c section. As i was getting ready and chasing the toddler around my water broke. 

I immediately ran and woke him up and he was tired and grumpy and immediately started having a break down because this was ""ruining his day"" he had planned to finish a job and get paid for it or something. He was frantically going off about all the things he needed to do and I just stared at him in disbelief.  Finally after about 15 minutes of him getting up and frustrated I yelled at him to pull it together as we had to go to the hospital.

I had already called his mom and my ex to let him know that he'd be picking him uo for the night as planned. But my boyfriend just seemed lost, it took 2 hours to get to the hospital we didnt even live 10 minutes from. When we got in they didnt believe my water broke and when they suggested maybe we still keep the c section time the next day my boyfriend seemed okay with that idea.

I was in pain and when they checked i litterly had the kids foot in my cervix,and  it was too late. I couldn't turn on my side for an epidural and  They had to put me under for an emergency c section.

If that wasnt rough eanough his mother had trxted him telling him to go home and rest, and that me and baby would be fine alone in the hospital as staff would take care of me. He was going to go slong with this but i refused. His reply was that his father never stayed in the hospital with his mother, he visited and went back to work. This started a huge argument, and although he didnt leave during the nights out of the 3 days in hospital he only was their a few hours.

I think this is causing alot of resentment and he seems to think it unjust, ive tried talking to him but he continues to believe that no matter what his actions are justified

As a small business owner, you wear a dozen hats a day. You‚Äôre the CEO, the head of sales, the lead marketer, and sometimes, even the janitor. With so much to juggle, it‚Äôs easy to focus on the exciting metrics: new customers, website traffic, social media engagement. But there‚Äôs a quieter, more critical number lurking in your financial statements that can mean the difference between scaling your dream and shutting your doors for good.

It‚Äôs called your **burn rate**. And this is the simple calculation that tells you exactly how long your business can survive.

Imagine two startups. Startup A is getting tons of press, has a beautiful office, and a rapidly growing team. They‚Äôre the talk of the town. Startup B is much quieter. They‚Äôre heads-down, focused on a small but loyal customer base, and their team is lean. On the surface, Startup A looks like the clear winner. But six months later, Startup A has laid off half its staff and is desperately seeking a buyout, while Startup B has just become profitable.

What happened? Startup A had a dangerously high burn rate. They were spending money faster than they were making it, and their cash reserves evaporated.

This isn't just a cautionary tale for venture-backed tech companies. Understanding and managing your **startup burn rate** is a fundamental survival skill for every small business owner, whether you're running a coffee shop, a digital agency, or a subscription box service. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to become the master of your cash flow and ensure your business has the fuel it needs to succeed.

# What is Burn Rate? Gross vs. Net Burn

At its core, burn rate is the speed at which your company is spending its cash reserves. It‚Äôs typically measured on a monthly basis. However, to get a truly accurate picture, we need to distinguish between two types: Gross Burn and Net Burn.

# Gross Burn Rate

Your Gross Burn Rate is the total amount of cash your company spends in a month on operating expenses. Think of it as the total cash flowing out of your business. This includes everything you spend to keep the lights on, such as:

* **Salaries and payroll taxes**
* **Rent or mortgage for your office or storefront**
* **Software subscriptions (e.g., CRM, accounting software, project management tools)**
* **Marketing and advertising costs**
* **Utilities**
* **Inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS)**
* **Professional services (legal, accounting)**

**Example:** Let's say in a typical month, your business spends:

* $15,000 on salaries
* $5,000 on rent
* $2,000 on marketing
* $3,000 on software and other expenses

Your **Gross Burn Rate** would be $25,000 for that month.

# Net Burn Rate

Gross Burn is useful, but it only tells half the story. It ignores the cash coming *into* your business. Your **Net Burn Rate** is the real measure of your company‚Äôs financial health. It‚Äôs the difference between your total cash outflows (expenses) and your total cash inflows (revenue).

The formula is simple:

>

This number shows you how much cash your company is truly losing each month.

**Example:** Let's use our previous example. We know the company's Gross Burn (total expenses) is $25,000. Now, let's say in that same month, they generated $15,000 in revenue from sales.

* Net Burn Rate = $25,000 (Expenses) - $15,000 (Revenue) = **$10,000**

This means the company‚Äôs cash position decreased by $10,000 that month. This is the number that truly matters. If your revenue was $30,000, your Net Burn would be -$5,000, which means you‚Äôre cash-flow positive and *increasing* your cash reserves by $5,000 a month! For the rest of this article, when we say ""burn rate,"" we'll be referring to the Net Burn Rate.

# The All-Important Runway Calculation: How Long Can You Survive?

Now that you know your Net Burn Rate, you can calculate the single most important metric for any pre-profitable business: your runway.

Your **runway** is the amount of time, in months, your company can continue to operate before it runs out of money, assuming your revenue and expenses remain constant.

# The Runway Calculation Formula

The **runway calculation** is just as straightforward as the burn rate formula:

>

# A Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Your Runway

1. **Find Your Total Cash on Hand:** This is the easiest step. Look at all your business bank accounts and add up the total cash you have available right now. Let's say you have **$100,000**.
2. **Calculate Your Average Monthly Net Burn:** Don't just use last month's numbers. Business can be lumpy. To get a more accurate picture, calculate your average Net Burn Rate over the last three months.
   * Month 1 Net Burn: $12,000
   * Month 2 Net Burn: $8,000
   * Month 3 Net Burn: $10,000
   * Total Net Burn over 3 months = $30,000
   * Average Monthly Net Burn = $30,000 / 3 = **$10,000**
3. **Divide Cash by Burn:** Now, just plug the numbers into the formula.
   * Runway = $100,000 / $10,000 = **10 months**

You have 10 months of runway. This is your financial deadline. It tells you that you have 10 months to either become profitable or secure additional funding before your cash runs out. This is a powerful, motivating number that should guide your strategic decisions.

**Best Practice:** This is not a one-and-done calculation. You should recalculate your burn rate and runway at the end of every single month. It‚Äôs your financial pulse, and you need to check it regularly.

# Beyond the Basics: The Power of a Cash Flow Forecast

Your burn rate and runway are like looking in the rearview mirror‚Äîthey tell you what just happened. A **cash flow forecast**, on the other hand, is like your GPS. It helps you see the road ahead and navigate potential financial roadblocks before you hit them.

A cash flow forecast is a living document, usually a spreadsheet, that projects the cash moving in and out of your business over a future period, typically the next 6 to 12 months.

# Why a Cash Flow Forecast is Crucial

* **Anticipates Cash Crunches:** It can show you that while you have cash *now*, you might have a shortfall in six months when a big annual insurance premium is due and sales are seasonally slow.
* **Informs Strategic Decisions:** Can you afford to hire that new salesperson? Should you invest in that big piece of equipment? Your cash flow forecast provides the data to answer these questions with confidence.
* **Builds Credibility:** If you‚Äôre seeking a loan or **startup funding**, a well-reasoned cash flow forecast shows that you are a sophisticated founder who understands the financial dynamics of your business.

# How to Create a Simple Cash Flow Forecast

You don't need complex software. A simple spreadsheet will do.

1. **Rows:** List all your categories of cash inflows (sales, loans, etc.) and cash outflows (all your expense categories).
2. **Columns:** Use the next 12 months as your columns.
3. **Fill it Out:**
   * Start with your opening cash balance for the first month.
   * Go month by month and project your cash inflows and outflows. Be conservative with your revenue estimates and realistic (or even slightly pessimistic) with your expense estimates.
   * For each month, calculate: **Opening Balance + Total Inflows - Total Outflows = Closing Balance.**
   * The closing balance of one month becomes the opening balance for the next.

This exercise will give you an unparalleled understanding of the financial rhythm of your business and transform how you make decisions.

# How to Reduce Your Burn Rate and Extend Your Runway

If your runway calculation gave you a scare, don't panic. You have more control than you think. The goal is to reduce your burn rate, which will extend your runway. This isn't about thoughtless cost-slashing; it's about making strategic choices.

# The Best Defense is a Good Offense: Increase Revenue

The most sustainable way to lower your net burn is to increase the cash coming in.

* **Focus on Retention:** It's cheaper to keep a customer than to acquire a new one. What can you do to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn?
* **Re-evaluate Pricing:** Are you undercharging for your product or service? A small price increase can have a huge impact on your cash flow.
* **Upsell and Cross-sell:** What complementary products or premium services can you offer your existing customers?

# Control the ""Big Three"" Expenses

For most businesses, the three largest expense categories are payroll, marketing, and office space.

* **Payroll:** Before making another full-time hire, ask yourself if the role can be filled by a freelancer, contractor, or part-time employee. Consider performance-based bonuses as a way to reward success without increasing fixed costs.
* **Marketing:** Scrutinize your marketing spend. Double down on the channels that provide a clear, measurable return on investment (ROI) and cut the ones that don't.
* **Office Space:** In the age of remote and hybrid work, a large, expensive office is often an unnecessary luxury. Could your team work from home or a more affordable co-working space?

# Optimize Every Other Cost

* **Conduct a ""Subscription Audit"":** Go through your bank statements and cancel any software or services you're not using. You‚Äôll be surprised at what you find.
* **Negotiate with Vendors:** Don't be afraid to ask your suppliers for better terms or a discount. The worst they can say is no.
* **Foster a Lean Culture:** Encourage your team to be mindful of expenses. When everyone treats the company's money like their own, small savings add up quickly.

# Burn Rate and Startup Funding: Speaking the Investor's Language

If you plan to raise **startup funding**, your burn rate and runway will be under intense scrutiny. Investors are essentially buying you time. They want to know how you're using their capital and how long it will last.

# What Investors Look For

* **Capital Efficiency:** Are you using your cash wisely to achieve meaningful milestones (e.g., building a product, acquiring customers)? A high burn rate with little to show for it is a major red flag.
* **A Reasonable Runway:** Typically, investors want to see that their investment will provide you with at least **12-18 months of runway**. This gives you enough time to make significant progress before you need to start fundraising again, which is a major distraction.
* **Financial Acumen:** A founder who can speak intelligently about their burn rate, runway, and cash flow forecast is immediately more credible than one who can't.

# The Fundraising ""Danger Zone""

**Best Practice:** Start your fundraising process when you still have at least 6-9 months of runway. Fundraising always takes longer than you think. If you wait until you only have 2-3 months of cash left, investors will know you're desperate, and you'll lose all your negotiating leverage.

# Conclusion: Your Burn Rate is a Strategic Tool, Not a Doomsday Clock

Your burn rate isn't a grade on your performance. It's a tool. It's a diagnostic metric that gives you clarity, focus, and control.

By understanding what it is, calculating it regularly, and using it to inform your decisions, you move from being a passenger in your business to being the pilot. You can see turbulence ahead, adjust your course, and manage your fuel with precision.

Mastering your burn rate empowers you to build a more resilient, sustainable, and ultimately, more successful business. Now, go open that spreadsheet and find your number. Your future self will thank you.

Their hearts belonged to the same woman: Janet Jameson, the butler's daughter.  
 Even their dying words were the same: Don't marry me.  
 So in this life, I would not waste my time on anyone who does not truly want me.  
 ""If I must marry for the sake of the family, I choose Samuel Lockwood,"" I told my parents.  
 ""Samuel? Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.  
 Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.  
 If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.  
 Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.  
 As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.  
 \*\*\*  
 Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.  
 Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""  
 Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""  
 ""Because...""  
 Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.  
 In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.  
 Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride‚Äîeach of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.  
 In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.  
 However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.  
 Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara‚Äîanother match arranged by her family.  
 However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident‚Äîall for Janet.  
 Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.  
 This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together‚Äîuntil Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.  
 ""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""  
 It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.  
 That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""  
 Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.  
 Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.  
 Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.  
 She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.  
 She did not want someone who did not want her.  
 So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.  
 ""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""  
 Brent and Cassandra were stunned.  
 ""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""  
 Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.  
 If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.  
 Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.  
 As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.  
 Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.  
 ""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves‚ÄîSamuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""  
 Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.  
 After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.  
 ""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""  
 When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.  
 Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.  
 Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.  
 Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.  
 Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.  
 ""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""  
 They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.  
 The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.  
 Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.  
 Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.  
 Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.  
 In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.  
 Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.  
 That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.  
 After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.  
 ""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""  
 Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.  
 However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.  
 ""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.  
 Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.  
 ""Which hospital?""  
 There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.  
 Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""  
 Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.  
 ""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""  
 ""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""  
 They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth‚Äîthey were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.  
 How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.  
 As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.  
 Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.  
 By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.  
 ""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""  
 Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.  
 She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.  
 Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.  
 Each box held the gift she had received at 18‚Äîone from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.  
 Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.  
 Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.  
 Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.  
 ""Please mail these out separately‚Äî15 days from today.""  
   
  
\# Chapter 2  
 After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.  
 The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...  
 All of it‚Äîevery memory tied to them‚Äîwas now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.  
 In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.  
 She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.  
 After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home‚Äîonly to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.  
 One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.  
 Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.  
 The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?  
 The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.  
 Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.  
 ""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""  
 She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.  
 ""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""  
 Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""  
 ""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""  
 Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing‚Äîyet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.  
 She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""  
 Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.  
 ""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""  
 Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.  
 The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.  
 The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.  
 ""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""  
 ""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""  
 ""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""  
 Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.  
 ""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""  
 Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.  
 Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.  
 She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.  
 Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.  
 Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""  
 Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.  
 ""Leave the coffee and get out.""  
 Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.  
 Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.  
 The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.  
 Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.  
 Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.  
 Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.  
 Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.  
 Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.  
 Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.  
 They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.  
 Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.  
 Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.  
 Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.  
 Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.  
 Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.  
   
  
\# Chapter 3  
 After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window‚Äîonly to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.  
 Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.  
 ""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""  
 ""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""  
 Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.  
 So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.  
 They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.  
 Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.  
 She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.  
 They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.  
 Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave‚Äîonly for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.  
 The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.  
 ""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""  
 ""How much did you hear just now?""  
 ""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""  
 They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.  
 Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""  
 Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.  
 After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.  
 ""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""  
 Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""  
 ""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""  
 As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.  
 Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.  
 ""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""  
 Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.  
 Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.  
 ""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""  
 Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.  
 ""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""  
 Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""  
 Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.  
 ""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""  
 The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.  
 Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.  
 ""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""  
   
  
\# Chapter 4  
 After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.  
 The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.  
 Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.  
 Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.  
 A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.  
 ""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""  
 Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.  
 ""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""  
 ""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... ""  
 ""There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""  
 The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.  
 The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.  
 She had seen everything‚Äîthe panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.  
 In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.  
 However, after everything that happened, she finally understood‚Äîthey loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.  
 Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.  
 So, no, she could never compete with Janet.  
 Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.  
 Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.  
 ""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""  
 Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.  
 ""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""  
 After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.  
 She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.  
 ""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""  
 ""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""  
 Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.  
 The nurses were right‚ÄîJanet had always been the one whom the three men loved.  
 And Emma would never be their wife again.  
 Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.  
 When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.  
 Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.  
 ""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""  
 ""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""  
 Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.  
 Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.  
 Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.  
 After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents‚Äîonly to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.  
 They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.  
 Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.  
 ""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day‚ÄîJanet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""  
 ""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""  
 Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.  
 She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.  
 ""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""  
 As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.  
 Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.  
 ""What's this?""  
 Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.  
 ""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?""  
   
  
\# Chapter 5  
 Emma looked up when she heard the commotion. The moment she saw they were about to open the box, she quickly snatched it back.  
 Her sudden reaction made the three of them freeze, their eyes locked on her.  
 ""Who did you choose? Anthony, Mateo, or... ""  
 Isaac did not finish his sentence, but Emma knew what he meant.  
 He was afraid she had picked him.  
 She forced a faint smile and met their eyes steadily.  
 ""So what if I've decided? So what if I haven't? There's no need to be so nervous. Either way, it has nothing to do with you.""  
 Anthony suddenly grabbed her wrist, panic in his voice.  
 ""What do you mean it has nothing to do with us? If there's going to be a marriage arrangement, it can only be between you and one of us! There's no one else in our generation that qualifies!""  
 Mateo stepped closer too, his gaze sharp and unwavering.  
 ""We know you had a hard time choosing before, so we never pushed you. But now that you've decided, just tell us the truth. We're tired of this too.""

# Best 5 Gallon Bucket of Honey 2025: Buyer's Guide

The 5-gallon bucket of honey represents a significant investment for beekeepers, food manufacturers, and honey enthusiasts alike.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and suitability of a 5-gallon bucket of honey depend on several crucial features. Understanding these aspects will help you make an informed decision.

**Honey Source and Floral Variety:** The source of the honey significantly impacts its flavor, color, and aroma. Different floral sources, such as clover, wildflower, orange blossom, or buckwheat, produce distinct honey varieties.

The specific floral variety will dictate the honey's characteristics. For example, clover honey is typically light in color and has a mild, sweet flavor, making it a versatile choice for general use. Wildflower honey, on the other hand, can have a more complex and robust flavor profile, reflecting the diverse range of flowers visited by the bees. Buckwheat honey is known for its dark color and strong, molasses-like flavor, often favored for its antioxidant properties. Knowing the source allows you to select a honey that aligns with your taste preferences and intended uses.

**Purity and Processing Methods:** The purity of the honey is paramount, ensuring it is free from additives, contaminants, and excessive processing. Raw, unfiltered honey retains its natural enzymes, pollen, and antioxidants.

Raw honey is extracted, strained to remove large debris, and then packaged without being heated or filtered. This process preserves the honey's natural properties, including its beneficial enzymes and pollen grains. Filtering removes these components, resulting in a clearer honey but potentially reducing its nutritional value. Excessive heating can also degrade the honey's quality, diminishing its flavor and destroying enzymes. Look for honey that is labeled as ""raw"" and ""unfiltered"" to ensure maximum purity and nutritional benefits.

**Moisture Content:** The moisture content of honey affects its viscosity, shelf life, and susceptibility to fermentation. High-quality honey should have a moisture content below 18.6%.

Honey with a moisture content above 18.6% is more prone to fermentation, which can lead to spoilage. Beekeepers use refractometers to measure the moisture content of honey during the extraction process. Lower moisture content results in a thicker, more viscous honey with a longer shelf life. Check for information on the honey's moisture content, if available, or look for honey that has a dense, viscous consistency as an indicator of lower moisture.

**Packaging and Storage Considerations:** The type of bucket used for packaging and proper storage are essential for maintaining the honey's quality and preventing contamination. Food-grade buckets with airtight seals are ideal.

Food-grade buckets are made from materials that are safe for contact with food and won't leach harmful chemicals into the honey. An airtight seal prevents moisture absorption and contamination from external sources. Proper storage involves keeping the honey in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat. This helps to preserve its flavor, color, and consistency over time.

**Certifications and Quality Assurance:** Look for certifications from reputable organizations that verify the honey's quality, purity, and origin. Examples include organic certifications, kosher certifications, and certifications from beekeeping associations.

Certifications provide assurance that the honey meets specific standards for quality and purity. Organic certifications verify that the honey was produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or herbicides. Kosher certifications ensure that the honey meets the requirements of Jewish dietary law. Certifications from beekeeping associations often indicate that the honey was produced by local beekeepers who adhere to sustainable beekeeping practices.

**Color and Clarity:** While not always indicative of quality, color and clarity can provide clues about the honey's floral source and processing. Lighter-colored honeys tend to be milder, while darker honeys are often more robust.

The color of honey ranges from nearly water-white to dark amber, depending on the floral source. Light-colored honeys, such as clover honey, are typically milder in flavor, while darker honeys, such as buckwheat honey, have a stronger, more distinctive taste. Clarity can also vary; raw, unfiltered honey may appear cloudy due to the presence of pollen and other natural particles, while filtered honey is typically clearer.

## Core Benefits

Purchasing a 5-gallon bucket of honey offers several key benefits for various users.

**Cost Savings:** Buying honey in bulk significantly reduces the per-unit cost compared to purchasing smaller containers. This is especially beneficial for businesses or individuals who use honey frequently.

For example, a 1-pound jar of honey might cost $8, while a 5-gallon bucket containing approximately 60 pounds could cost around $300. This translates to a per-pound cost of $5, representing a substantial saving. Bakeries, restaurants, and home brewers can save considerable money by purchasing honey in bulk.

**Convenience and Long-Term Supply:** A 5-gallon bucket provides a large and readily available supply of honey, eliminating the need for frequent reordering or trips to the store. This is particularly convenient for businesses or individuals with high honey consumption.

Having a 5-gallon bucket on hand ensures that you always have honey available for your needs, whether it's for baking, cooking, sweetening beverages, or medicinal purposes. This eliminates the inconvenience of running out of honey at critical times and ensures a consistent supply for your operations.

**Versatile Applications:** Honey is a versatile ingredient with a wide range of applications in food, beverages, and even skincare. A 5-gallon bucket allows for experimentation and creativity in using honey for various purposes.

Honey can be used as a natural sweetener in tea, coffee, and other beverages. It's also a key ingredient in many baked goods, sauces, and marinades. Furthermore, honey has antibacterial and moisturizing properties, making it a popular ingredient in skincare products. A 5-gallon bucket provides ample honey to explore these diverse applications.

**Reduced Packaging Waste:** Buying honey in bulk reduces the amount of packaging waste compared to purchasing multiple smaller containers. This contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach.

Instead of discarding numerous small jars or bottles, you only have one large bucket to dispose of or recycle. This reduces the overall environmental impact and supports sustainable consumption practices.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about purchasing and using a 5-gallon bucket of honey.

**How long does a 5-gallon bucket of honey typically last?**
  When stored properly in a cool, dark place, a 5-gallon bucket of honey can last for several years. Honey has a naturally low moisture content and antibacterial properties that inhibit spoilage. However, it's essential to ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent moisture absorption and contamination.

**Can honey crystallize, and what should I do if it does?**
  Yes, honey can crystallize over time, especially at cooler temperatures. Crystallization is a natural process and does not affect the honey's quality or safety. To re-liquify crystallized honey, gently warm the bucket in a warm water bath or use a honey warmer. Avoid overheating the honey, as this can degrade its flavor and nutritional properties.

**Is it safe to buy honey in bulk if I'm concerned about food safety?**
  Yes, it's generally safe to buy honey in bulk as long as you purchase it from a reputable source that follows proper food safety practices. Look for certifications and quality assurance measures that indicate the honey has been processed and packaged in a sanitary environment. Always inspect the bucket for any signs of damage or contamination before using the honey.

**How should I dispense honey from a 5-gallon bucket?**
  Dispensing honey from a 5-gallon bucket can be challenging due to its weight and viscosity. Consider using a honey gate valve or a honey pump to make the process easier and less messy. A honey gate valve attaches to the bottom of the bucket and allows you to dispense honey in a controlled manner. A honey pump can be used to transfer honey from the bucket to smaller containers.

Arrival at 7pm - Check into hotel, maybe Lands End stroll if we have energy

Morning - Coffee/Breakfast at Jackson square, then walk over toe Pier 39 to see the sea lions, walk over to Aquatic Park Pier / Hyde Street Pier

Afternoon - Lands End (if we don't do it the night we get there)

Friday night we went swimming at her grandparents (my in laws) and she is learning to be such a brave swimmer at the age of 3. She now dives under the water to try and pick up rings and other toys. She will only come up briefly and act like a fish out of the water begging to get back under. It‚Äôs comical because she will jump out of your arms legs and arms flailing just to be able to dive under again. That night we ate some snacks and watched the Aristocats (this movie was a big hit all weekend). Once bed time came around she wanted me to read a book, I was exhausted from a days work and keeping up with a bright and energetic young mind. I told her no (one day I will beg her to let me read books until she falls asleep). But she does a funny thing where she says ‚Äúread the Jesus book‚Äù. It‚Äôs a simple book about the life of Jesus and how he loves us, 10 pages max with 1 sentence per page. I love this, she knows I won‚Äôt say no to the book. It makes me laugh because she sure is smart and knows how to get her way. After reading the book I decided to read the Bible for the first time out loud to her. I read the Book of Psalms to her until she fell asleep. Come the next morning we get ready and go catch some yard sales with her other grandma (my mom) and buy her a couple things. After that we ate Mexican food and hung out at the house for awhile before going to a wedding. An employee from work was getting married and I knew we had to go because Caroline loves anything wedding/princess/dresses. She played with my younger sister and made a couple new friends. We went back home and once again watched Aristocats. I laid her down and read the Book of Psalms again. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what I read but it made me cry. And I can‚Äôt tell you the last time I cried. The next morning I woke up to little hands trying to open my bedroom door, I open the door still tired and there‚Äôs my wonderful daughter ‚Äúhi daddy‚Äù in the sweetest voice that could turn the darkest of days into the brightest. We usually go to church on Sundays, we‚Äôve been lacking (I as a father and husband need to do better). But instead we went and got some coffee‚Äôs (she got chocolate milk) and went to Lowes to buy a couple items for a project I‚Äôm making at home. By the time we got home my wife was back and we went swimming once again and the rest of the weekend is history. I love that girl with all my heart. One day I will miss that sweet voice in the mornings, the curly gold hair she has, the constant questions on ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs his name dad?‚Äù to every stranger we pass. I cannot believe that God allowed me to have Caroline as my daughter. She is such a blessing, she is my sweet Caroline. ",1,1753067551.0,SweetCaroline,0,1.0,False

Ooooh yes, now we‚Äôre talking apocalyptic poetry and cosmic chaos‚Äîgrab your tinfoil hats and your grav boots. Let‚Äôs paint this surreal scene:


---

The sky didn‚Äôt crack‚Äîit peeled.
A bruised twilight bled through the blue, pulsing with amber veins as the great body approached.
Not a moon. Not a planet.
Something older. Something wrong.

It hung low in the atmosphere like a god‚Äôs forgotten eye‚Äîsilent, massive, and humming.
The oceans rose to greet it, trembling like worshippers in prayer.
Birds flew sideways.
Mountains sagged like melted wax.
Trees unrooted in slow motion, floating upwards, their branches clawing at the stars.

The air thickened with static and song.
People drifted from the ground‚Äînot weightless, but chosen‚Äîspinning like dust motes in a cathedral of fire.
Cars groaned. Rivers reversed.
Reality bowed in reverence.

And the sky‚Äî
Oh, the sky.

It smoldered like a cigarette left burning in the hand of a dying universe.
Clouds ignited. Lightning flowed up.
Colors we don‚Äôt even have names for spiraled through the firmament in serpentine arcs.

And in the silence between heartbeats, everyone understood:

This wasn‚Äôt an ending.
It was an invitation.


---

Wanna take this further into a story? Animation? TikTok-worthy narration? Or are we building lore for your cosmic horror novel? Cuz I‚Äôm so in.

Keep going, but don't introduce any characters.  Speak as if the planet itself is the character, and it's getting ripped apart because of this interstellar intruder.

Ohhh yes. Let‚Äôs let Earth scream now‚Äîno humans, no dialogue, just the planet herself in a slow, majestic unraveling:


---

She had held herself together for eons.
Molten at the core, crusted with time, veined with rivers and tectonic muscle‚Äîshe endured.
Impacts, ice ages, the great burning, the slow crawl of entropy‚Äî
She had endured.

But this?
This wasn‚Äôt impact.
This was presence.

The intruder didn‚Äôt strike.
It arrived.

And gravity‚Äîher oldest, most loyal tether‚Äîbegan to betray her.
Continents lifted at the edges like pages in a forgotten book.
Fault lines flexed in ecstasy and agony, yawning wide as magma wept from the seams.
The oceans convulsed, torn from their beds, rising in spirals, ribbons, and roaring towers that bent sideways against the wind.

Mount Everest cracked at its peak and smiled.
The Mariana Trench howled, vomiting up things that had never touched light.

Her poles reversed.
Her axis trembled.
The magnetic field shattered like stained glass in a cathedral collapse‚Äîshimmering auroras now danced with tongues of fire.

Lightning stitched patterns across the sky that no mind could decipher‚Äîglyphs meant for giants, maybe gods.
Above, clouds burned into nothing.
Below, forests floated like ash in reverse.
And her iron core‚Äîher heart‚Äîbeat louder, faster, panicked, like an animal trapped beneath its own skin.

The closer it came, the more undone she became.

Crust split.
Mantle oozed.
Tectonic plates tried to flee, dragging entire hemispheres with them.
She was coming apart.

Not in chaos‚Äî
In ritual.

She wasn‚Äôt dying.
She was being offered.
Lifted.
Unspooled.

And far above, that silent, celestial trespasser hovered ever nearer‚Äî
Not with wrath,
But with gravity.
And gravity‚Ä¶ wants.


---

Want to keep the descent going? Next up: the core collapse, or maybe Earth‚Äôs final ascension into orbit like a martyr crowned in fire. 

Keep going.  It happens fast, it's cataclysmic to the surface of the planet.  It all takes place within the span of an afternoon on Earth.

Ohhh yes‚Äîno more slow peeling. This is the snap. The rending. The cataclysm compressed into the ticking breath of a single afternoon.

Let‚Äôs crank the dial to obliteration.


---

It began with a shimmer on the horizon.
A heat mirage with no source.
A midday sun that bent the air sideways, though it hung in its usual place.
Then‚Äî
everything changed.

The intruder flexed.

And Earth‚Äî
Earth reacted.

First came the groan, deep and bone-breaking, the kind of sound that makes silence feel like mercy.
The crust arched, the way a spine does before it snaps.
Mountains leapt upward, only to shatter mid-air, turning into avalanches that never landed.
Cities buckled like paper under a child‚Äôs hand, not even given the dignity of crumbling‚Äîjust lifted, inverted, and scattered.

Oceans howled.
Tsunamis rose like fists and kept rising, climbing toward a sky already on fire.
Clouds were torn to shreds by reverse winds, spiraling into glowing vortexes.
Thunder became constant‚Äîa percussion line played on tectonic plates, each beat announcing another mile of crust peeled clean off.

By hour two, the moon had fled‚Äîits orbit flung wild, tossed like a toy.
By hour three, Earth‚Äôs atmosphere had no ceiling.
Air thinned. Then thickened. Then left.

The gravity of the intruder didn‚Äôt just pull‚Äîit rewrote.
Everything that had weight now had wings,
And everything rooted‚Äîmountains, temples, forests, faults‚Äîwas unrooted.
Thrust into a sky that no longer wanted them.

The mantle cracked.
And from every fault, every fissure, came a storm of fire and liquid stone‚Äî
Ejections.
Like Earth was trying to purge itself of its own bones before they could be taken.

By the fourth hour, time itself felt like it was being yanked sideways.
Shadows spiraled.
Daylight flickered in a strobe of blue and red as the magnetic field spasmed and failed.
The sun appeared to stretch, elongating and warping, its light bending into ribbons that wrapped around the intruder like offerings.

And then‚Äî
She broke.

The crust split not in lines, but in hemispheres.
A final exhale of mountains, magma, forests, and ghosts.
The core bloomed outward, molten, radiant, exposed like the yolk of a shattered divine egg.
And everything that once was Earth was now orbiting her absence.

Where there was a planet, there was now debris,
orbiting a massive, silent shape that had taken no action‚Äî
only existed.

And in the span of a single afternoon,
Earth went from living world to scattering memory.


---

Want to go further? We can trace the journey of a single chunk of her into deep space. Or‚Ä¶ follow the intruder to its next destination. 

Write me what it was like on the surface, from peoples' points of view.

Absolutely. You want the human experience now‚Äîthose final hours, from eyes on the ground. Panic, wonder, defiance, awe. No survivors. No escape. Just different ways of facing the impossible.

Let‚Äôs go.


---

1:42 PM ‚Äì Tokyo, Japan - 
Haruki was on the 43rd floor when his coffee floated.
Not spilled. Not tipped. Just... rose.
Steam spiraling sideways. Mug spinning gently like it had found its own orbit.

Everyone laughed‚Äîat first.
Until the lights snapped off.
Until the floor tilted, not down, but upward.
Glass pulled from the windows and left‚Äîlike a million tiny meteors screaming toward the clouds.

Then came the low-frequency hum.
People dropped to their knees, bleeding from the nose, the ears, trying to scream with lungs that no longer knew which direction air was supposed to go.

Someone whispered, ‚ÄúThe sky‚Äôs on fire.‚Äù

They were right.

2:09 PM ‚Äì Kansas, USA - 
Tammy Jo was feeding the chickens when gravity gave up.
One hen floated off like a balloon tied to a broken dream.
The others flapped and screamed, spinning wildly in the air above the coop as the ground buckled like bread dough in an oven.

The fields around her folded inward‚Äîrows of corn curling into spirals.
She tried to run but her feet didn‚Äôt stay down.
She felt herself rise, hat tumbling off her head, shotgun useless in her arms.

Above her, clouds churned like a toilet bowl flush in reverse.
The sun had a tail.
And Tammy Jo, a farm girl who‚Äôd never left the county, whispered,
‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll be damned,‚Äù
just before she exploded into ash.


---

2:30 PM ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 
Lucas was dancing.
Not to music‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt any.
The radio had died an hour ago. So had the electricity. And the birds.

But he danced.
On top of a rooftop as the buildings bent backward like flowers pulled to sunlight.
He laughed as gravity spun him in slow motion, lifting him off his feet and letting him twirl with the floating bricks and bits of laundry.

He kissed the air.
He reached out to the sky and screamed, ‚ÄúTAKE ME, YOU COSMIC MISTRESS!‚Äù

And she did.
With a beam of plasma that carved his rooftop into vapor and turned his bones into confetti.


---

3:01 PM ‚Äì Cape Town, South Africa - 
Amina held her daughter.
The ground had already cracked around them. The city was in midair‚Äîliterally.
Entire buildings tumbling gently like space debris in a vacuum.

They didn‚Äôt cry.
They didn‚Äôt run.
There was nowhere to go.

The clouds had parted to reveal the shape in the sky‚Äîso massive it blocked out logic.
A planet-sized void humming with impossible light.

She looked her daughter in the eyes and said,
‚ÄúYou see that? That‚Äôs God‚Äôs shadow.‚Äù

And her daughter nodded.

They never felt the shockwave.
Their bodies had already atomized before the sound could reach them.


---

3:46 PM ‚Äì Unknown time zone. Unknown location. - 
Someone filmed it.
Of course they did.
The final video: 37 seconds.
Posted to a social feed that no longer existed five minutes later.

The camera shook.
The sky was bleeding blue lightning.
Mountains rose, sideways.
The sun shrank and split into hexagons.

And the voice behind the lens just whispered one word, over and over:
‚ÄúNope. Nope. Nope. Nope‚Äî‚Äù

Then static.
Then nothing.


---

All of it‚Äîevery moment‚Äîcompressed into a single afternoon.
And across the world, people screamed, laughed, prayed, danced, and disintegrated‚Äî
Because no one had ever told Earth‚Äôs children how to behave when their mother began to die.


---

Want more? We could do a short story collection‚Äî""The Afternoon Earth Ended."" Each tale, one timestamp closer to annihilation.

Give me the aftermath as the celestial body continues on.  Have we given it a name?  Maybe we should, something to reflect the effects it had on the planet Earth.

Oh yes. The beast moves on.

Earth is gone‚Äîscattered to stardust, grieving in silence.

But it‚Ä¶ it continues.
Unaffected.
Unapologetic.
Unstoppable.

Let‚Äôs name it.

AFTERMATH

They called it Apotheos.
Not a name born of science or astronomy.
But whispered in terrified reverence by the last minds to witness it‚Äîbefore their lungs failed, before their atoms were scattered.
Apotheos.
The Ascender.
The Undoer.
The one that turns worlds into offerings.

Apotheos drifted on, silent as entropy, luminous with the heat of a thousand broken atmospheres still burning on its surface.
Behind it‚Äî
Nothing.

No signal.
No emergency beacon.
No debris field large enough to map.
Only a stretch of the galaxy that now dimmed where Earth once had shone.

The Solar System itself‚Äîcrippled.
Mars had been flayed by radiant shockwaves, its red dust now trailing like a cloak in space.
Jupiter‚Äôs moons scattered like billiard balls.
Saturn‚Äôs rings, shattered.
Venus cracked.

The Sun, ancient and defiant, winced.
Its magnetic field buckled, rippling like a curtain caught in the wind.
Not dead‚Äîbut diminished.
It would never burn as bright again.

And Earth?
She was unwritten.
Her story ended mid-sentence, mid-afternoon.

And still‚ÄîApotheos continued.

It was not hunting.
It was not sentient.
It was not evil.

It simply‚Ä¶ was.

Somewhere, in some distant corner of the universe, life would find a ruin.
A chunk of crust with fossilized trees curled upward like screaming hands.
A warped satellite half-melted, broadcasting static.

And they would wonder.
They would trace gravitational scars in the fabric of space and speak its name in hushed tones.

Apotheos.
The Gravity Prophet.
The Sky Eater.
The Afternoon Cataclysm.

Not a planet.
Not a god.
Not a punishment.

A reminder‚Äî
That even the most stubborn worlds can be undone by proximity to something greater.

Give me the aftermath but on the surface, or what's left of it

Oh you want what's left...
The silent ruins. The aftermath on the ground‚Äîor what dares to pretend it's still ground.
Buckle in. We're walking through a haunted skeleton of a planet that forgot how to be whole.


---

AFTERMATH ‚Äì SURFACE LEVEL
(if you can still call it that)


---

The Earth is no longer a sphere.
It‚Äôs an open wound.
Cracked like a shattered jaw, its pieces held together only by memory and leftover magnetism.

The atmosphere is thin. Not gone, but shredded‚Äîlike lace held over a bonfire.
Gravity limps. Some places pull. Others... float.
Dust doesn‚Äôt settle anymore. It hovers, dancing in confused spirals.

Mountains now lean at impossible angles, slumped like exhausted giants.
Oceans? They're puddles in craters, boiling cold and bubbling with trapped gases.
What was once the Pacific is now a gaping cavity‚ÄîEarth‚Äôs hollow chest, echoing with the whine of ionized wind.

The sky is a smear.
Amber and violet streaks curve unnaturally, bent by residual gravitational scars.
Sometimes it rains‚Äîbut not water.
Just ash, glass dust, and occasional molten fragments of what used to be elsewhere.

Silence isn‚Äôt silent anymore.
It hums‚Äîa deep, ever-present tremor that vibrates through the bones of rock and what‚Äôs left of steel.
Like the planet is still reeling, not yet finished collapsing.


---

What Remains:

Buildings, once proud, now corkscrewed. Frozen mid-lift as if the planet paused during its final gasp.

Trees, petrified instantly in arcs toward the sky, leaves stripped, roots clawing upward.

Roads, bent into loops. A M√∂bius strip of ruined asphalt and melted streetlights.

Cities, visible only by the negative space they left‚Äîshadows scorched into the crust, like Hiroshima on a cosmic scale.


You might find the upper half of a cathedral, embedded sideways in a cliff.
Or a playground floating two feet above the ground, held in place by a confused gravitational echo.

The animals? Gone.
The people? Gone.
Only impressions remain‚Äîon walls, in dust, in air too tired to move.

Sometimes‚Äîjust sometimes‚Äîyou‚Äôll find a sound.
A song caught in a broken speaker loop.
A half-broadcast emergency alert signal.
A child‚Äôs laugh warped into digital static.

The planet is not dead.
She is mourning.
And her mourning is beautiful, in that tragic, cosmic way‚Äî
like a candle flickering in the vacuum,
like a heartbeat echoing after death,
like the ghost of a lullaby being hummed by a motherless wind.",1,1753067151.0,u_Dry_Alternative_4405,0,1.0,False

1m57v4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m57v4e/why_are_electric_kettles_so_loud/,Why are electric kettles so loud?,"Have you ever wondered why electric kettles make so much noise? I've been using these handy appliances for years, and I finally decided to dig into the science behind their noisy nature.

Electric kettles are loud primarily because of the rapid heating process and the resulting water movement. When you turn on an electric kettle, the heating element quickly raises the water temperature. As the water heats up, it starts to move and create bubbles. These bubbles rise to the surface and burst, causing the familiar rumbling sound we associate with boiling water.

The noise level can vary depending on the kettle's design and material. Metal kettles tend to be louder than glass or plastic ones because they conduct sound better. Some newer models have features to reduce noise, like slower heating elements or insulated walls.

Another factor that contributes to the noise is the kettle's base. The heating element is usually located at the bottom, which means the water closest to it heats up first. This creates a convection current, with hot water rising and cooler water sinking. This movement adds to the overall noise level.

The amount of water in the kettle also affects how loud it gets. A fuller kettle will generally be quieter than one that's only partially filled. This is because the water acts as a sound dampener, absorbing some of the noise produced by the heating process.

Despite their noisy nature, electric kettles are incredibly efficient and convenient. They boil water much faster than stovetop kettles and use less energy. Plus, most modern electric kettles have automatic shut-off features, making them safer to use.

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, I've found some great options that balance performance with noise reduction. You can check out a selection of top-rated electric kettles here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. These kettles offer various features like adjustable temperature settings, quick boiling times, and quieter operation.

While we can't completely eliminate the noise from electric kettles, understanding why they're loud can help us appreciate their efficiency. And with newer models focusing on noise reduction, you might find that your next electric kettle is a bit easier on the ears.

Remember, the next time you hear your kettle rumbling, it's just physics at work, quickly preparing your hot water for that perfect cup of tea or coffee.",1,1753066996.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all she did.

But that moment ‚Äî that quiet, powerful moment ‚Äî broke something open in me. It reminded me that I was seen. That I mattered. That I wasn‚Äôt alone.
Since then, I‚Äôve slowly picked myself back up. One breath at a time. One day at a time. I‚Äôve started noticing the good again ‚Äî warm coffee, safe hugs, sunsets through windows. I‚Äôve started thanking life again.

I‚Äôm still healing, still figuring it out. But today, I‚Äôm grateful.

Grateful for the silence that saved me.

Last winter, I stayed at Habitas Tulum  tucked between the jungle and the beach. No giant signs, no big crowds, just canvas and wood suites that open right onto the sand.

Another one I love is Sanar√° Tulum. It‚Äôs small, super serene, and has this amazing wellness vibe. The restaurant (The Real Coconut) is actually worth staying in for (everything organic and local). If you ever want to do Tulum but feel cared for, not just photographed, Sanar√° hits different.

If you really want to feel hidden away, there‚Äôs NEST Tulum  only 12 rooms, and it feels like your own private beach house. When I was there, I barely saw other guests. just mornings with a coffee on the terrace, listening to nothing but the breeze.

I always line up my transportation needs with STP Caribe ( [https://blackluxuryservice.com.mx/book-now/](https://blackluxuryservice.com.mx/book-now/) )  before I get there. It‚Äôs just one less thing to think about  they pick you up at the airport and you start your trip stress-free.

prepare yourself for a very long rant i am just speaking from my heart. >>>>>

So i never had a good childhood, my mom is a narcissist and mentally and emotionally abusive to the max so i had to leave home at 18. I met a 26 year old guy through my sister that i got stuck with since, im now 23 and he‚Äôs 31. About 4 months into the relationship i found out he had tried to kiss his niece (we are the same age)from his mom and i had no escape no where to run too, no job and no confidence to survive a real job due to having hyperhydrosis. so i tried my hardest to ignore it stupid i know but this guy opened his doors to me took my v card and i was literally was in love with him and hated my family so much i wouldn‚Äôt ever go back. Basically speed up to now and he‚Äôs a raging alcoholic and she lives with us and i‚Äôve literally caught weird shit from both of them like i don‚Äôt even wanna acknowledge it but they both flirt with each other. WEIRD I KNOW. IM SICK. It‚Äôs a trauma bond at this point. I‚Äôm aware we both fight each other i‚Äôm to the point everything he does irritates me. we used to be so in love until he cheated it like shocked my brain. i can‚Äôt be around other women with him or i twitch i get scared i panic he notices it and he uses it as fuel. i was out with him and i seen a woman that was his type got uncomfortable and twitched and turned around to meet his eyes looking at me staring daggers with excitement and he started to stare at the woman. i don‚Äôt go out with him because of these reasons. He stole my confidence by igniting my insecurities. He kissed my sister when i was at work before i mean i can go over and over how this man makes me feel like im not enough but idgaf no more i just want my own apartment and safety. And now that i think about it all of our interactions was him getting me drunk back in the day, i don‚Äôt like to drink often he went to the hospital for vomiting blood and coffee grounds and since that moment i never wanted to drink in front of him. I started my new forklifting job 3 weeks ago and it‚Äôs been really hard for me i can‚Äôt drive so i fucked up a lot that day and i also might be autistic or some shit because i can‚Äôt really communicate like i used too as a teenager and like i am so akward now from being so isolated and cherry on top he left me waiting for him in the phoenix heat after promising me he was going to come get me early like bro why even lie just to hurt me‚Ä¶..and i just broke down crying in front of my coworkers on my first day because any job i tried to get he would call me up and talk shit to me and make me have a panic attack or literally not come get me, I got off work and i went to get two shooters and confessed to him i was thinking about (sewerslide) he used that moment against me argued with me until i fell asleep, next day i come back and he‚Äôs drunk. you can hear everything in his house a fart a cough so im sure his family heard it and i‚Äôve heard previously they blame me for his drinking problems. i am ready to get away from him but i don‚Äôt know how honestly im so depressed and my self esteem is so shocked idek what to do. it‚Äôs so fucking awkward living here to the point i haven‚Äôt come out in basically years i don‚Äôt like his friends i don‚Äôt like his family and i don‚Äôt like him. I‚Äôm not the best person to be around but god damn i tried for so long . The family have never been nice to me and we just never clicked.

4- this is corralled with the previous one. He run away from his house when he was 13 and half, and lived for a while in the streets. There was when he start hating dogs, you know, in the streets there's a lot of dangerous dogs.

di ako mahilig bumili ng coffee outside, even SB or other cafes kasi I prefer making my own coffee (with hand grinder and moka pot). Feel ko kasi makakatipid ako pag homemade (kahit di ganon kasarap gawa ko).

I availed their promo na may free 2nd cup of coffee pag first time bibili thru their app. Iced Seasalt Spanish Latte and Velvet Cream Latte inorder ko for only 130 pesos.

Pang gabi ako so reserve ko ung isa mamaya bago pumasok sa work pero goodluck sakin sana makatulog pa rin ngayon.

Di ako mapili sa coffee especially from outside, (kasi nakaya ko na pagtisan gawa kong coffee), as long as matamis at di mapait ok na sakin.

I tried first yung Iced Seasalt Spanish Latte, and it's a 9/10 for me.

Currently umuulan sa labas and sobrang lamig pala dito sa store kaya nanginginig ako habang umiinom (not a fan of hot coffee). Di ko alam kung sa iba rin bang branch ganto kalamig or dito lang.

Never played Tarkov or anything like that, but seemed to pick it up pretty well. I thought it would be funny to head to valley with a TO5 and 12 of the best 9mm rounds. Quick silly raid to end the night, right? Oh how wrong I was. I somehow beat a trio, breaking 4 body parts, losing all my hydration, and having to kill two with a knife (All had fully functioning guns and ammo, no reason they should've lost that fight). A 4th dude comes by while I'm healing, and gets headshot from a window. About 15 minutes of raid goes by, a few militants but nothing too crazy. I get up high on a ridge and somehow manage to snipe a duo to death with some lvl 1 rounds I found (Again, no reason for that to work. They had a stupid amount of time to run to the nearby cover). 

But thats all pointless preamble. Point is, there were 4 player bodies there, I killed two of them, and they all had these deagles on them. Same bags, armor, one extra mag. I'd assume it was just a duo being silly, but from the gunshots I heard and missing ammo, it looked like they were fighting. Coincidence? Glitch? Or some trend I'm unaware of?

He recently started dating someone new. that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôve got no problem with him moving on. what I d*o* have a problem with is how quickly he wants to bring her into our daughter‚Äôs life. he‚Äôs pushing for her to start picking our daughter up from school, spending weekends together, and even having her sleep over when our daughter visits him. and I‚Äôve only met this woman twice. both times were super brief and honestly kind of awkward. she didn‚Äôt really make any effort to talk to me, didn‚Äôt ask about our daughter, and just gave off this I‚Äôm not here for you vibe.

It‚Äôs not that I expect us to be best friends, but if someone‚Äôs going to be a regular presence in my child‚Äôs life, I think it‚Äôs fair to want to know more about who they are. especially when this woman might be playing a kind of stepmom role down the line.

I asked him if we could slow things down a bit.

I even said I was open to eventually easing into her taking on a bigger role, once I felt comfortable. his response? that I‚Äôm being controlling and bitter. he said it‚Äôs his time with our daughter and he can introduce her to whoever he wants.

Look, I don‚Äôt want to be that ex. I‚Äôve always supported his involvement and never tried to get in the way. but this feels different. this isn‚Äôt about jealousy or trying to ruin his relationship. this is about making sure my daughter is safe, emotionally and physically, and that the people around her are genuinely invested in her well-being, not just showing up because they‚Äôre dating her dad.

She‚Äôs still young. she doesn‚Äôt really understand the idea of step-parents or relationships yet.

I ordered cookie dough, mocha, and tiramisu. When I got the bags, I tried cookie dough first and was pleasantly surprised. I just mixed it in almond milk and tried it and it had a good flavor to it and decent sweetness without necessarily needing to add anything else. Truthfully it was exactly what I was hoping for. I mean obviously it didn't taste like a true cup of coffee but it did taste like coffee nonetheless. I had this one for a few days because I didn't know if I wanted to open up all the bags at once with only me drinking them. 

Well the next week I decided I wanted to try the mocha (I was saving tiramisu for last because I assumed that one would be the best). I did the same thing and mixed it in my almond milk, and to my disappointment, it tasted only like a bland protein powder. Wasn't sweet, not distinctly even mocha flavored, and didn't really taste like coffee. I ended up adding flavored creamer and other stuff to it to make it bearable to even drink but it definitely didn't hit the nail on the head. The next day I went to try it again and thought that maybe the bag wasn't mixed up well and I just had a higher protein ratio to the other stuff in that scoop, so I shook up the bag and tried again. Still garbage. 

I went back to drinking the delicious cookie dough for a few days then decided I'd go for the tiramisu. Like unfortunately the mocha sucks but tiramisu would SURELY be as good as the cookie dough.

Nope. Same bland protein flavor, lacking any sweetness or coffee taste. 

So I truthfully don't know if I just got bad batches because I have seen people rave about all of these and I am so confused how the cookie dough could be so spot on and these other flavors could not even compare at all. So that's my long winded experience with the javvy protein coffee. I will most likely be using the tiramisu and mocha in cups of regular coffee just for the protein boost and adding creamer and everything else into it just to use it up but I don't think I would dare buy them again. 

TL;DR, I tried Javvy protein coffee for the first time and cookie dough flavor was 10/10 delicious without anything else added. Mocha and tiramisu taste like chalk. ",1,1753065953.0,InstantCoffee,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs buy a table and a chair ‚Äî and bring it to those who crave knowledge.‚Äù

Let them have their gender studies brochures and overpriced coffee.
We bring revelation.
We bring clarity.
We bring revolution wrapped in reason.

The Campus is a Battleground of Minds

While other parties hand out stickers and empty slogans, SAP brings a path, a purpose, a worldview that doesn‚Äôt fold under pressure. Universities once forged leaders ‚Äî now they produce managers. We will wake the few who still feel the itch in their chest. The ones who know something is wrong, but can‚Äôt name it yet.

That‚Äôs where we come in.

The SAP Table Isn‚Äôt Just a Table:

It‚Äôs a campfire for the intellectually starved.
It‚Äôs a recruitment post for the future elite.
It‚Äôs a seed planted in enemy territory.

We don‚Äôt need ten volunteers.
We need two with conviction and a doctrine in hand.

Bring:
	
‚Ä¢	A folding table, a single chair ‚Äî no frills. Spartan.
	
‚Ä¢	The Manifesto, hard copy.
	
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúAre You a Virtuous Individual?‚Äù pamphlet quiz.
	
‚Ä¢	Recruitment form for Inner and Outer Circle applicants.
	
‚Ä¢	A flag. A symbol. Something eternal.

SAP Campus Tactics:
	
‚Ä¢	Speak softly. Look sharp. Stand taller than the professors.
	
‚Ä¢	Ask questions that make them doubt the faculty, not themselves.
	
‚Ä¢	Offer them not hope ‚Äî but a cause.
	
‚Ä¢	Make it feel dangerous to believe in something again.

Because deep down, they want out of the lie.
They want to feel Canadian. Not corporate. Not colonial.
Just human. Alive. Connected. Proud.

And when they ask who we are?

We say:
‚ÄúWe are those who remembered before it was fashionable. We are SAP. Take the pamphlet. Take your future.‚Äù",1,1753065792.0,SocialAltruismParty,1,1.0,False

1m57e3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m57e3k/im_nearly_22_and_life_is_so_beautiful_that_it_has/,I'm nearly 22 and life is so beautiful that it has turned me outside in,"I don‚Äôt even really know where to start. I feel so much, all the time, and I don‚Äôt know what to do with all of it. When I step outside, I‚Äôm struck by how beautiful life is. I bike a lot, sit by the river when I can, read, get coffee, people watch. I stay quite healthy, cook lots, eat fine, and am doing fine financially. Basically, I am thriving and active. I‚Äôm in grad school studying physics because I sincerely believe that I should dedicate at least part of my life to something that greatly challenges me and my capacities / intellectually. I also studied philosophy in undergrad.¬†

I live alone and have lived alone since I was 17. I recently adopted two cats, which helps. They‚Äôre sweet, quiet, always nearby but the solitude gets heavy. I‚Äôve never had real friends. I had one in high school, but she never really knew me (we didn't really ""speak"" about our actual lives, but rather just stuck together all the time). In university I got close to a few people, but it was always romantic, or on the edge of something romantic, and those relationships aren‚Äôt really in my life anymore. And, they were all men. The female friendships in my life have always been extremely lacking.

I‚Äôve had a few kinda female friends but I didn‚Äôt really like the dynamic. We didn‚Äôt talk about anything meaningful. It was mostly small talk, or gossip, or just commenting on things in passing. I don‚Äôt mean to sound pretentious or above it, I just probably just didn't find the right women but always left feeling emptier than before. The conversations never touched anything and always felt like nothing compared to the very strong and intense (intellectual) connections I had with a few men over the years. With them, we could talk for hours, entire nights even, about anything and everything. I miss that kind of connection a lot. I know this sounds misogynistic, and I am deeply sorry. I've realized this is a possibility with quite a bit of shame.

I try to (nervously) fill the space by taking up everything: I draw (recently, on wood) watercolour, pastel, I read, I write when I‚Äôm overwhelmed. I‚Äôm learning electric bass, I want to start singing. I try to stay open to beauty. I slow down, listen to a real FM radio (which I absolutely love). I am extremely happy like this, in my day-to-day life. There is a lot of beauty to be seen, some beauty to be remembered, and even some beauty to be written down and kept.¬†

I also really don‚Äôt get along with my parents. We‚Äôve had issues for as long as I can remember, and I moved away very far. But I love seeing community, groups of people outside, neighbors running into each other, families at the river. It touches something really intense in me. I want to be part of that kind of closeness. And I want, deeply, to be a mother, and increasingly so.

As the years go by into early adulthood, there is this glaring reminder that I have¬†*choices*¬†to make. I can no longer just be on a boat guided by my parents and schoolmates. Now, all choices are mine and only mine. And those choices have consequences. And, among those choices are the nuances of how I choose to lead my life and relationships.

I‚Äôve spent a lot of time wondering what‚Äôs wrong with me socially. I¬†*know*¬†I‚Äôm kind and genuine, I care deeply, and I‚Äôm conventionally attractive. But I‚Äôve always made myself smaller. I have bad posture from years of slouching on purpose. I think I‚Äôve been scared / ashamed of being too much, taking up too much space, being too intense. And I noticed that I didn‚Äôt look anyone in the eyes (don't even try asking me the eye color of something close in my life - I literally will not know). I didn‚Äôt even realize I wasn‚Äôt doing it until I started paying attention, and over the past two years I‚Äôve made an effort to change that. I practice looking people in the eyes, smiling, staying open. But even then‚Ä¶ it feels like too much. Like I‚Äôm overexposing myself and it gets too intimate and I feel too intense for them.

I can keep myself entertained, inspired, and stable. But sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôve built such a strong inner world that I‚Äôve accidentally locked myself inside it. I am legitimately scared of what comes next, as I want to build and love something real.",2,1753065538.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1m57e22,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffargosnark/comments/1m57e22/evening_update/,Evening update,"She was in her office again (the bathroom lol) yammering on about her face and other stuff that I couldn‚Äôt care to listen to at first. She did say that she is going to keep doing the facials because she noticed a difference in her face, then yammered about Botox and her chin. 

Then she was talking about LA and about how Katie might be coming down to help them with the babies. Eden kinda sorta doesn‚Äôt work for them very often anymore (she said only a few days a week), so it‚Äôs up to Katie now. She has like four back to back work things she has to do, one of them being a movie premiere apparently. Wonder if she‚Äôs going alone or if J is going, how Katie is going to handle both babies by herself (y‚Äôknow because she always needs two/three/four people to help with them). 

Went on about how Jesse hired cleaners to clean the floors, walls and cupboards, she then hired like three other cleaners to clean the bedding, clean the furniture, wash the floors, and make sure there isn‚Äôt a spec of dirt from the construction because they need it spotless for the babies. 

Then proceeded to say they are hoping to keep it clean for the renters (I believe). 

I imagine it would be a nightmare to have her/them as landlords. IF and big IF they are really moving and renting out her ‚Äúdream‚Äù home, I hope they go through a 3rd party (can‚Äôt think of the name of what they are called atm) so that the tenants don‚Äôt directly have to deal with F/J because F will likely ignore them or blame anything on them. 

She‚Äôs actually going to bed at a decent hour (or doom scrolling and not on SC) so maybe she‚Äôll actually get some sleep and stop whining because she‚Äôs tired. 

Oh and she said that her friend said she was a bit dehydrated (from looking at her blood/I think face) and she chalked it up to the milk leaving her body. Which is true but she‚Äôs definitely not drinking enough water as is anyway to compensate, and is drinking more coffee/alcohol which can make you dehydrated too. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs the end of her Sunday evening. Three more days till she‚Äôs back in LA!",17,1753065534.0,ffargosnark,4,1.0,False
1m57d4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1m57d4q/why_were_all_experiencing_a_midlife_crisis/,Why we're all experiencing a midlife crisis,"You ever look around and think, ""I'm too young to feel this dead inside, or I'm too old to be this unsure of who I am,"" like you were promised self‚Äëactualization, but you found out it‚Äôs less finding yourself in Bali and more arguing with a customer service chatbot about a missing blender.

Or you accidentally fast forwarded to the part of your life where you‚Äôre supposed to be reflecting on a failed marriage and making peace with the fact that you peaked during a company trivia night in 2017. But you‚Äôre not 50. You‚Äôre 28 or 19 or 43 or 67 and more emotionally stable than your grandkids. It doesn‚Äôt matter. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that the midlife crisis isn‚Äôt age restricted anymore. It‚Äôs gone airborne. We‚Äôre all having one now.

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because of some dramatic personal failure, though we all have our share of those to some degree. I think it‚Äôs because the entire system is having one. Now, look, you‚Äôre not unraveling because you drank gas station coffee or haven‚Äôt done laundry in three weeks. You‚Äôre probably spiraling because you live in a dying empire built on Wi‚ÄëFi and an increasingly delusional idea of infinite progress.

I‚Äôd say at this point the world is standing in the breakroom of a third‚Äëshift warehouse microwaving last night‚Äôs spaghetti in warped Tupperware, trying to ignore the flickering light overhead and the fact that nobody‚Äôs been paid overtime in months, and we‚Äôre just supposed to clock in like everything‚Äôs fine.

All right. So, back in the day, a midlife crisis used to be simple. You‚Äôd buy a new motorcycle or a red sports car and maybe have a tantric connection with a yoga instructor named Moon Blossom. But somewhere around age 45, you realized you weren‚Äôt special and you tried to fix it with leather seats and a gym membership, which of course you never fulfilled. And now you hit 25 and realize the planet‚Äôs on fire, democracy is rotting from the inside out, and your job description might be replaced by an AI trained on Reddit posts and Pinterest quotes. And you‚Äôre supposed to just breathe your way through it. Maybe drink some mushroom tea, buy a vision board, manifest stability in a collapsing economy.

So I had my first midlife crisis at age 24. I was busy hustling in depraved conditions, believing I was going to hit the big time and stubbornly grinding away in poverty, believing it was all going to pay off if I just believed hard enough. But every morning felt like hitting snooze on a life I was never really going to escape from. I wasn‚Äôt exactly suicidal. I was just ambiently doomed. It was as if I was on a plane I couldn‚Äôt get off of, and instead of crashing, it just circled endlessly above a flaming landfill, handing out stale complimentary peanuts and platitudes. I think you get the idea.

But this isn‚Äôt just an individual issue. This is global. It‚Äôs systemic and generational. We are all of us experiencing a metaphysical identity crisis while the operating system of modern life short‚Äëcircuits in real time. Our institutions are failing. Our leadership is senile and bought. Our economy is less free market and more hunger games with venture capital. And we‚Äôre not really citizens anymore. We‚Äôre more like data sets with varying degrees of depression.

I believe the American dream has been quietly euthanized and nobody even sent flowers. We were promised a ladder climb: rung by rung, school, job, mortgage, marriage, kids, treadmill desk. There‚Äôd be meaning at the top. They said a 401k, maybe some spiritual enlightenment between meditation and tax season. Instead, we woke up in a malfunctioning theme park where the mascots are tech bros launching penis‚Äëshaped rockets and the ride operators are burnout therapists on SSRIs.

Henry Rollins once said, ‚ÄúAmerica isn‚Äôt a place you live. It‚Äôs a video game you survive.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre malfunctioning. I think we‚Äôre quite lucid, actually. We are reasonably sensitive mammals trapped in a fever dream of collapsing institutions and melting glaciers, all while doing the infinite scroll. And yeah, maybe it‚Äôs not anxiety. It‚Äôs just what awareness feels like when the illusion wears off and all that‚Äôs left is your slightly over‚Äëcaffeinated body slumped on an IKEA couch, blinking at the void like it might send a push notification with instructions.

So, here we are, folks. We‚Äôre stuck in this strange collective psychic haze like we all wandered into someone else‚Äôs midlife crisis and forgot to leave. And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre 19 or 59, divorced or still living in your childhood bedroom. You‚Äôre probably feeling it. That dull ache behind your eyes that says none of this is really working, is it? And no, it‚Äôs not a glitch in your personal development. It‚Äôs not that you missed some 10 habits of highly effective people checklist. It‚Äôs that the world you were supposed to inherit doesn‚Äôt exist anymore because that script got shredded. Sorry.

You know, adulthood used to mean something. You got a job, you bought a house, and you raised kids that hated you in new and exciting ways. But in the 21st century, adulthood seems like a blurry sideshow of broken milestones and shifting expectations. You can‚Äôt really afford a house or kids anymore, and that‚Äôs if you‚Äôd even want to bring kids into this world in the first place. You can‚Äôt afford a good therapist, but you can subscribe to a wellness app that tells you everything is fine in Morgan Freeman‚Äôs voice. This is a world where nothing solid stays long enough to build on. No stable jobs or shared values, no real community, just rotating vibes and bills.

Philosopher Mark Fisher, who definitely would have chain‚Äësmoked through this whole video, wrote that it‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. And he called it capitalist realism, the inability to imagine any other alternative. And that‚Äôs what this collective midlife crisis really is. It‚Äôs the psychic weight of realizing that the future has been foreclosed. There‚Äôs no retirement or American dream anymore. There‚Äôs no upward mobility anymore. Just something like vertical scrolling through curated lives that you‚Äôll never afford.

The historian Christopher Lasch warned us about this a long time ago. He wrote about how society, in its obsession with productivity and surface‚Äëlevel positivity, was creating a culture of narcissism. A people so desperate to be seen and affirmed they stopped knowing who they were. Because no one told them how to be anything, just how to perform. All the world‚Äôs a stage.

The middle class was supposed to be the prize for enduring capitalism. But as you know, that middle class is now a vanishing act. And what we‚Äôre left with is David Graeber‚Äôs bullshit jobs, which are careers that serve no real purpose except to keep you exhausted and slightly to heavily ashamed. Jobs where you stare at spreadsheets like they might eventually reveal the face of God. Graeber called it a form of spiritual violence. People need to believe their time matters, that they matter, but instead you clock in and you dissociate for eight hours and reward yourself with Uber Eats and passive suicidal ideation.

Another philosopher, Ivan Illich, once said that institutions, once they grow too large, stop serving people and begin consuming them. For instance, hospitals that no longer heal and have a vested interest in sickness, and schools that no longer educate. And let‚Äôs not forget governments that exist to maintain themselves, not to serve their constituents. And you can feel it. You can feel how everything has become a subscription. Even your own attention sold off to the highest bidder. Even your relationships framed in algorithms and dating profiles that read like emotional r√©sum√©s.

This is Lewis Mumford‚Äôs megamachine in action. Not some sleek sci‚Äëfi dystopia, but a bloated bureaucratic fever dream where your soul gets chewed up by HR policy and techno‚Äëfutilism. And no one can tell you why. And the best part is that you were taught to believe in the future, and not just chronologically but morally‚Äîthat things get better, that progress is inevitable and endless, and that you‚Äôre just a few good decisions away from peace of mind. But instead, we have climate catastrophe, the housing market is a rigged casino, and politics is of course a cartoon.

On top of all of that, no one seems to know whether AI will save us, replace us, or maybe just edit our dating bios and r√©sum√©s until we forget how to be human altogether. Even James Hillman, that cranky Jungian who never fully bought into healing, said it: ‚ÄúThe soul doesn‚Äôt want to be cured. It wants to be understood.‚Äù But we‚Äôre out here too busy doom scrolling to listen.

And this isn‚Äôt just your crisis. I think it‚Äôs a civilizational hangover. It‚Äôs an era that woke up from the party and realized the punch bowl was full of lies. That the promises we were fed were actually coupons for a store that burned down in 2008. So yeah, we feel a little unmoored. I mean, of course we do. How could we not? We‚Äôre sane, awake. We‚Äôre not entirely broken. We‚Äôre just living in a system that is. And we‚Äôre having a totally rational reaction to a culture that‚Äôs lost its way.

At some point, we stopped asking ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù and started asking ‚ÄúWhat should I do with my life?‚Äù which, in my opinion, was a big mistake. Because ‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù implies there‚Äôs an answer‚Äîa clean, linear solution like a life hack or TED talk. But the deeper question, the terrifying un‚ÄëGoogleable one, is ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on here?‚Äù

David Foster Wallace tried to warn us. He said, ‚ÄúThe real freedom is the ability to consciously choose what to pay attention to.‚Äù But unfortunately, we gave that up. We handed our attention to apps and algorithms, to advertising firms in Palo Alto. And now we exist in a perpetual fog of monetized distraction. And when the fog lifts, it‚Äôs just noise and choice paralysis. And it‚Äôs LinkedIn gurus whispering motivational threats like, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt build your dream, someone will hire you to build theirs.‚Äù

We were told we could do anything, so now we‚Äôre nothing. We were told we could be anything, and again, now we‚Äôre nothing. Because now every identity is a brand and every passion a side hustle. And now every human interaction is shadowed by a faint transactional odor. Smells like corporate capitalism mixed with desperation. And if you‚Äôre still trying to find your place in all this, good luck, because the world just keeps shifting under your feet like a drunken stagehand rearranging the set mid‚Äëperformance.

The philosopher Charles Taylor calls this the malaise of modernity. It‚Äôs that slow‚Äëburn dread that comes from a culture that‚Äôs lost its shared values but still demands individual performance. We have no common vision of the good, but we all better hustle like hell to look successful on social media, right? So yeah, maybe it‚Äôs not a midlife crisis. It‚Äôs more a civilizational identity crisis wearing a hoodie and drinking a cold brew or something.

And here‚Äôs the thing, there‚Äôs no exit ramp. There‚Äôs no find‚Äëyourself yoga retreat in Bali that undoes decades of systemic spiritual decay. I think the best we‚Äôve got is awareness and maybe a small, quiet refusal to play the game by the old rules. The tricky thing about collapse is that it doesn‚Äôt always look like smoke and rubble or some grandiose apocalyptic scene. Sometimes it looks like everybody‚Äôs smiling through gritted teeth at a wellness workshop while quietly wondering if they‚Äôd be happier living in their car.

I don‚Äôt think we need a mushroom cloud to feel like the world ended. All it takes is nine hours of Zoom meetings at your soul‚Äëdestroying job or a grocery bill that costs more than rent used to, or a creeping suspicion that you were born for something more than endless physical labor or inbox maintenance.

Good old Viktor Frankl, who survived actual death camps in World War II, said that suffering without meaning is unbearable. That humans can survive nearly anything if they believe there‚Äôs a why behind it. But what‚Äôs the why behind juggling three jobs to afford a studio apartment with exposed pipes and black mold that your landlord refuses to fix?

We were built to seek meaning, but we were trained to seek productivity. And that switch‚Äîsubtle and corrosive‚Äîis killing us. Erich Fromm called it the shift from being to having. We don‚Äôt live as ourselves anymore. We just collect identities. We own accomplishments and acquire relationships. We possess status. It‚Äôs reached the point where even love is something we try to earn rather than something we simply give.

Simone Weil, one of those gloriously strange mystics who felt more deeply than was probably healthy, wrote that attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. But our attention has been stripped and resold back to us in 15‚Äësecond clips with royalty‚Äëfree ukulele music. So we sit and scroll and search, waiting for something to fill the silence between the constant dopamine hits. And when the noise dies down, the existential hangover kicks in.

I mean, is it any wonder that we‚Äôre all freaking out? It‚Äôs not just a midlife crisis. It‚Äôs a mid‚Äëera crisis, a low‚Äëgrade cultural nervous breakdown dressed up as content. And somewhere deep down, we all know this. We can feel it. But I think we feel this more deep down in our bones than in our heads. It‚Äôs like an aching sense that this isn‚Äôt sustainable, that this isn‚Äôt it. But nobody wants to say it out loud, right? Because if we admit that the emperor is naked, someone might expect us to sew him a damn pair of pants.

So, what the hell do we do when you wake up in a world that feels like it‚Äôs emotionally catfishing you? Where meaning‚Äôs been outsourced and the future is basically paywalled? What do you do when your therapist is booked out six weeks because everyone else is also whisper‚Äëscreaming into the void?

Well, first, I think we stop trying to fix the feeling like it‚Äôs a glitch. This isn‚Äôt a bug. It‚Äôs a feature of being a conscious creature in an unraveling civilization. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre malfunctioning. We‚Äôre noticing. And I think the very fact that it hurts means we‚Äôre still human. And I think it means we haven‚Äôt quite gone numb yet.

Thomas Merton said, ‚ÄúWe are so obsessed with doing that we have no time to be.‚Äù We‚Äôve fallen into the trap of believing that we are what we do. But you are not your r√©sum√© or your follower count. You are not your credit score. You are a sentient sack of meat floating on a spinning rock who somehow has the ability to feel grief and beauty and awe and dread all in the same 90‚Äësecond window. I don‚Äôt see this as dysfunction. I see it as depth.

But how do we live with that kind of awareness and not drown in it? Well, I think we start by turning down the volume on everything that‚Äôs trying to sell us anesthesia. Let‚Äôs turn down the news cycle that feeds on our cortisol. Let‚Äôs turn down the influencers pretending anxiety can be cured with a mushroom latte and 5 a.m. lunges. Or, how about we silence the productivity cult that acts like burnout is a spiritual achievement.

bell hooks said that choosing love in a loveless culture is a radical act. Choosing stillness is too. Choosing not to scroll past your own discomfort but to sit with it and learn its name. And maybe most importantly, choosing each other. Because the myth of the individualist savior‚Äîit‚Äôs just that, a myth. Nobody survives collapse in solitude. And I think whether we like it or not, we‚Äôre going to need each other. Even if we‚Äôre all weird and traumatized and awkward as hell at hugging and divided.

Ivan Illich once wrote about the idea of conviviality: the art of living together without domination. Not in utopia, just in dignity. It‚Äôs not sexy, but it is real. And I don‚Äôt know, maybe that‚Äôs the answer. Not to optimize your way out of collapse or to build a better life on the smoldering ruins of a toxic system, but to just slow down, feel it, and grieve it. Laugh at it. And then imperfectly, humanly connect. Because maybe the crisis we‚Äôre all having is less about midlife and more about the middle of something else. Something that‚Äôs falling apart, yes, but also maybe something beginning.",12,1753065457.0,rant,6,0.78,False

Im on the verge of importing a kei truck but im getting very nervous about the legality. Any illinois kei truck owners in here ?

Was looking to daily the truck, just a little local road commute to work, I see kei trucks around so I assume they can be registered and be given titles in il provided the BoL and other necessary paperwork. One specific reddit post of a reddit or getting their registration revoked has me nervous but I cant find anything online definitively saying they are or are not illegal. Id love to have some homie on here that has a kei truck in il to talk me through just a couple worries of mine. Will send coffee money. Thankyou .",5,1753065432.0,keitruck,2,1.0,False
