I get to write in my journal while I have coffee on the couch surrounded by my pets. 
I‚Äôm shocked this has happened as only a couple days ago I posted here that I still don‚Äôt see the point in this.

The point still eludes me, but I now find it soothing to scrawl away about nothing at all and see the black squiggles filling up the pages, seemingly of their own volition. ",1,1732457281.0,Journaling,0,1.0,False

1gyrq0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1gyrq0r/legality_of_living_in_a_steel_barnindustrial_unit/,Legality of living in a steel barn/industrial unit on your own land (wales/england),"I own a few acres upon which a friend often grazes his sheep. I believe I can get planning permission to put up a steel framed barn on the land. I assume the terms of the planning would be that the building is for agricultural use but my question is can I legally use some of the barn space for space for my hobbies.

For example the plan was with a 40'x100' steel framed barn with sheep pens and then enclosed and insulated garage area for tool/machinery storage and workshop space. Could I feasibly also put my woodworking and metalworking kit in there? Could I fix my car in there if there were issues since I'd have all the kit for working on the tractor already. Could I section off some of the workshop and put my weightlifting kit in there and use some of the space as a workout zone? 

But most importantly, if I can do all that and end up spending all my free time in my workshop I'll probably end up crashing out to sleep on the sofa some nights so can I legally stick a bedroom or something in it so I can have a more comfortable night! 

Perhaps have a mezzanine with a bedroom, bath/shower, kitchenette for a coffee and pot noodle, and even another room for a home office.

Now I'm unsure of the legal standing of this as I could in theory be living in there for days at a time but it wouldn't be my home address as I have a house about 10 minutes down the road. ",1,1732457193.0,LegalAdviceUK,1,1.0,False

The whole haul gets extra thematic points for me - coffee, hiking and gardening are three of my favorites things.

**Moms**, when you think of¬†**Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the¬†***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.¬† But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes,¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was secretly a¬†***business mastermind***?¬† That's right, and if you‚Äôre a¬†**mom**¬†looking to dominate the¬†**entrepreneurial world**, there‚Äôs one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that¬†**MJ magic**¬†into¬†**your empire**,¬†***‚ÄùMomPreneurs‚Äù***¬†a very serious well thought out¬†**business guide for moms**.¬†¬†

Yes, you read that right.¬† Forget the¬†***‚ÄôThriller‚Äô***¬†album; the real thriller was how¬†**MJ**¬†ran his¬†***business empire***¬†from¬†**Neverland**.¬† And what was¬†**his greatest secret**?¬† Multitasking ‚Äì something¬†**moms**¬†have been doing since the dawn of time.¬† He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings,¬†*(probably)*.¬†¬†

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think¬†***the Moonwalk***¬†is just a fancy dance move, it‚Äôs actually an¬†***elite business strategy***.¬† One step forward, two steps back ‚Äì just like building a company!¬† You have to take a few risks, but if you‚Äôre slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to¬†**Moonwalk**¬†through your day ‚Äì from diaper duty to client meetings ‚Äì without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).¬†¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ**¬†wasn‚Äôt just the¬†***King of Pop***¬†‚Äì he was the¬†***Smooth Criminal***¬†of branding.¬† Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?¬† He wore ONE glove.¬† Genius.¬† Just like that,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it‚Äôll leave your competition asking,¬†***‚ÄúAnnie, are you okay?‚Äù***¬†¬†

**Moms,**¬†you don‚Äôt need to be the best at¬†***everything***; you just need to be memorable¬†***in your business niche.***¬† And hey, who better to teach you that than¬†**Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?¬†¬†

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland***¬†wasn‚Äôt just a place for frolicking around with¬†**Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was¬†**Michael‚Äôs**¬†dream world.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of¬†**Neverland**¬†‚Äì a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that‚Äôs your thing).¬†¬†**MJ**¬†knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you‚Äôll do the same ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a¬†***mom-run empire***¬†from your kitchen table. ¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of**¬†***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn‚Äôt just an accessory but a statement?¬† Well, in¬†***MomPreneurs***, you‚Äôll learn how to create your own ‚Äúglove moment‚Äù in the¬†**business world**.¬† Every¬†**successful entrepreneur**¬†has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.¬†¬†**Your business**¬†needs a ‚Äúglove‚Äù ‚Äì and no, it doesn‚Äôt have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be¬†***fabulous***.¬† Whether it‚Äôs a signature service, product, or your personal flair,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will help you find it.¬†¬†

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you‚Äôre a man) of Your Business**

Much like¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was crowned the¬†***King of Pop***,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to become¬†**the Queen of your business.**¬† Don‚Äôt let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.¬† In fact, if¬†***Michael Jackson***¬†could write¬†***Billie Jean***¬†while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can¬†**build a six-figure business**¬†while managing playdates.¬†¬†

So, do you want to learn¬†***MJ‚Äôs real secrets***¬†**to success**¬†and apply them to your¬†***MomPreneur***¬†journey?¬† Then grab a copy of¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†today.¬† It might not teach you how to¬†***Moonwalk***, but it¬†***will***¬†teach you how to hustle like the¬†***King of Pop***.¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

***\*Disclaimer:***¬†*While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.¬† However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.¬† But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of ‚ÄúMomPreneurs‚Äù, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*¬†¬†",1,1732456900.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

Firstly We met in 11th coaching classes, first time i saw her i liked her. so i tried to talk to her but it failed due to she don't want to talk. After sometime she initiated to talk to me in classes and we talked and i asked her out. But she tell she can't come for coffee so we talked on a  play ground and i confesses that i like you and she replied that accha but seriously i like another boy she clearly stated it so i said ok fine and bye and that boy was her (ex bf).
After that my heart felt heavy but i accepted it but want to genuinely know the boy who she likes means i just want to look at who is he?
After few days i again approached her and said can we be just friends and she replied yes and i asked her insta but she was not using insta at that time we connected on snap on her brothers id and talked talked like months of months and she started showing the signs of gf bf traits on chat and by reading chat no one can tell we were just friends but we were.  After that i got frustrated and said lets be in relationship now but she denied denied and walked out her life that last time.


And i got connected somewhere else with someone who loves me and genuinely loves me, cares for me literally pray for me in everything. And we got in relationship and that relationship longed (1 year and 2 months ) the ideal gf for any boy in Today's time. Listens everything and just want me and  ignore everyone.
  We get into long distance relationship after my 12th as i shifted to college and we both were loyal to each other. But one day my roomate asked about the girl i used to like in coaching and i started missing her üôÇ now thinking ( it as biggest mistake fuck) and went to hometown to meet her again we talked again and got connected again on snap and i accept that i clearly cheated on my ex gf for 2 months cause she was unaware of me talking to her. Later she find out about us but still she was loving me she got hurt so worst but still wants me and i was unable to handle both and i have to choice between them and i choose the girl i liked rejecting gf and i don't clear out things with my ex gf and we breakup after my ex gf brother finds about us through insta..
After that the girl i liked proposed me on 14feb with cute lines written for me and we started our relationship. Fights are common not that worry for me after 4 months of relationship. Her brother finds about us through her phone and we didn't talk around 1.5 months no contact at all. That phase was the worst i was unable to decide what to do wait for her or leave. But i decided to wait and after 1.5 months she created a fake acc for me from her friend to talk to me. She describes what happened at her home only half things shared. And clearly stated that she don't want relationship now and if you want to talk she can talk to me on that acc for less time. 

Again she asked what you want i said that i can't move on directly so talk to me as a friend we started talking and talked 3 months again we get closed talked like bf gf but having no tag of relationship on it and we don't know what is our status.
We were doing it because we were having feelings for each other. But she is not my gf was hurting me from inside and i started getting jealous whoever she talk. She clearly tells me whom she is talking and she was just replying. But here i used to get angry and jealous why you talk this that, it was ok but for small things which should not matter were hurting me. It was getting toxic but instead of loving her i was just fighting which i done wrong i accept it. She done everything that shows she loves me. 
One day she talked to one boy from her med college and she was telling every details whatever they talk but i angrily asked for ss of chat she said u believe in me or chat i replied chat in angry tone and then she said she don't want to talk and i continuously called 20 times to her she was fallen asleep still she picked up the call and i was on my ego to prove her wrong what she is doing in angry tone very angry tone which i never used infront of her. After that she called me in morning but i was on ego i cutted call 2 time and after 3rd call she was taking but i cutted call on her mouth. After that she blocks me and after few hours she unblocked and wrote a note that she can't handle it anymore i don't want to live with you . After this also she called me 5 times but i was driving so i was unable to pick the call and i was in hurry to admit my friend to hospital due to his health and in that chaos i received her call and i read the msg of insta after 7 hrs and answered hmm to that long note üòÆ‚Äçüí® . I am seriously stupid one to this and she also asked on call what is your reply i said hmm üò≠ . And she blocked me.

She told not to contact to me she is going to block from wp, call and insta everywhere. On that same day i tried to apologise for whatever happened she was full cold which is obvious after that. She said she don't want to solve it bye.

I said lets be just friends she said i will not talk to you more than 10 min ok . I am totally confused what to do now?
 
She is behaving total cold like she don't give a fuck about me now is it the truth?

I am just calling her she is talking to her friends but not to me ignoring me whole way possible 
I am not able to understand to give up on her or not cause the way she is treating is hurting me and hurting so much that i am writing this 3 in morning cause i am not able to sleep .
If i don't contact her she will be distanceed from me and one day we won't be able to get the bond and i am fearful of that and dont want to loose it. What should we done in this situation pls i am suffering bit hard..
How should i make her to solve it?
Should i give her space and ignore her?
If i will ignore her it will create distance between us and i will loss her what should be best thing to do it's been 1 week incident happened. ",2,1732456898.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

At the time I was 22F, about 119-122lb, 5‚Äô5.
Generally healthy. I was drinking a lot to do my job (involved a lot of socializing which is hard for me). I, at the time, was doing a lot of other substances in general (young partying‚Äîyou know). These are all very bad decisions and I don‚Äôt partake in activities like this anymore so please don‚Äôt judge.

I would drink about 3 airplanes shots right at the beginning of my shift, back to back, then I‚Äôd have 3 more shots throughout the night, and I‚Äôd drive home. Often times I‚Äôd smoke out of a weed vape pen and a regular nicotine vape pen. 
On a regular night of this, when going home, I was still drunk. I wish sitting at a Wawa to sober up by drinking a coffee. Out of nowhere, my vision in my one eye started to look like TV static. It started in what I can only describe as the corners of my vision. Every time I would blink trying to get it to go away it would not‚Äîand it slowly encroached in on my entire field of vision in that one eye.

I sat there blinking over and over again. Then it began in my other eye. I was panicking. This continued for 45 minutes.

It never happened again in my life whether I was drunk of sober. What could have possibly happened?

I wanted to share my experience and knowledge about home furniture living room sets since I recently went through the process of furnishing my new place. Trust me, it was quite a journey!

Living room sets are basically coordinated pieces of furniture that are designed to work together both functionally and aesthetically. Think of it as getting the whole package ‚Äì usually including a sofa, loveseat, accent chairs, and sometimes coffee tables or end tables that all match or complement each other.

I remember when I first started looking, I was totally overwhelmed by all the choices. But here's what I learned: getting a complete set actually makes the whole process way easier. You don't have to worry about whether pieces will match or if the sizes will work together ‚Äì it's all figured out for you.

The best part about modern living room sets is how versatile they've become. You're not stuck with those old-school matchy-matchy vibes anymore. I recently found this awesome contemporary set here: https://athometouch.com/sofa that really opened my eyes to how stylish these packages can be.

Let me break down why getting a set might be a good idea:

1. Cost-effective: Buying pieces together usually costs less than getting them separately
2. Guaranteed match: No more second-guessing if colors or styles work together
3. Space planning: The pieces are designed to work together in standard room sizes
4. Time-saving: One-stop shopping instead of hunting for individual pieces

Some popular styles I've seen include:
- Modern minimalist sets (my personal favorite)
- Traditional formal sets
- Casual contemporary sets
- Rustic farmhouse collections

When I was shopping around, I noticed that material choice is super important. Leather sets look amazing but might not be great if you have pets. Fabric sets like the ones I found here: https://athometouch.com/sofa are more family-friendly and come in tons of options.

Pro tip: Before buying, measure your space! I learned this the hard way. Also, consider your lifestyle ‚Äì if you have kids or pets, you might want something more durable. And don't forget to check if the set comes with any warranties or protection plans.

The cool thing about today's living room sets is that many come with modular pieces, so you can rearrange them based on your needs or room layout. Some even have cool features like built-in USB chargers or reclining functions.

I hope this helps anyone who's in the market for new living room furniture! Feel free to ask any questions ‚Äì I've been through the whole process and happy to share more details about my experience.",1,1732456443.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 29M, and I‚Äôve always been the go-to person for others to vent to. But when I try to share my frustrations, people either ignore me or dismiss what I‚Äôm saying. Over time, I‚Äôve learned to handle this and set boundaries, which has helped me manage most social interactions.

However, there‚Äôs this one colleague who‚Äôs been a unique challenge. He‚Äôs struggling with depression and seems to connect only with people who insult him‚Äîgenuine insults, not playful banter. Despite this, I tried to be supportive, offering positive advice over coffee for months, even though we weren‚Äôt particularly close. He often went out of his way for people who exploited him, and I never took advantage of that, though I did try to point it out indirectly.

Things changed after I gave him constructive criticism for some mistakes at work. Oddly enough, he started acting like we were close friends, but I soon realized he only values relationships where he‚Äôs insulted or berated. To him, that‚Äôs how genuine friendships work. I couldn‚Äôt keep up with that dynamic and went back to my usual, neutral self.

Last week, I hadn‚Äôt slept for a couple of days due to work stress and ended up venting to him while we were eating. His response shocked me. Instead of supporting me or even joking to lighten the mood, he started gaslighting me. He mocked my choices, said I‚Äôd fail because I wasn‚Äôt working harder, and even criticized me for standing up to my boss (who is actually understanding).

Out of curiosity, I tested his reaction further by sharing some past frustrations about work and how I handled them. He doubled down, mocking me for not ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù my job and claiming I should ""simp"" for people to find meaning. At that point, all I could do was laugh it off.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson: toxic people can‚Äôt handle help, and if you show vulnerability, they‚Äôll use it to drag you down. I‚Äôm proud I didn‚Äôt let him get under my skin, but I‚Äôve decided to distance myself. From now on, I‚Äôll keep interactions strictly professional‚Äîsmall talk and boring topics to keep him at arm‚Äôs length.

It‚Äôs frustrating but also eye-opening. Have you ever dealt with someone like this? How did you handle it?

He wakes up at 7 to go to the gym every weekday. 

On the weekends he gets into a loop of staring into his phone and wasting the day away..he feels horrible afterwards. I want to help him so bad. He's a brilliant person but his phone addiction is bringing him so much pain. He is aware of the problem. He knows it's his phone is causing him to while away the whole weekend..

I run my own company, and the way I enter my uninterrupted flow state is by going to a quiet cafe, ordering a coffee (Iced Americano) and just going at the work at hand for 5-6 hours straight. It works so good for me. But this method does not work for him. He gets distracted and overwhelmed by the people around him and ultimately stops working. 

My question is: 
1) What is your work type? Like how do you enter your flow state? I want to try and identify my boyfriend's flow state trigger. Like for me, going to a cafe where I know people are watching me gives me motivation to work. 

2) I know he's afraid of asking for help. So what can I do passively to help him out. Eg. I can try and take his phone away. Or I can try and find a genuine co-op working space. Something that is conducive to a genuine working motivation.

# The Test

I use Claude professionally as a developer, and I decided to track my usage for a day. I replicated all my Claude interactions in TypingMind to compare costs and limits.

# The Results

* Regular workday of coding-related queries and assistance
* Didn't hit the Claude subscription limits
* The same interactions in TypingMind: 4 euros FOR ONE DAY
* That's potentially ‚Ç¨80-120/month if used consistently

# The Reality Check

Let's be real here - you're getting access to one of the most advanced AI models available for less than what most people spend on coffee each month. If you're constantly hitting limits or feeling ""scammed,"" you're probably:

1. Not structuring your prompts efficiently
2. Treating Claude like it's ChatGPT (it's not)
3. Not utilizing Claude's capabilities properly
4. Failing to learn from Claude's responses to improve your interactions

# Value Proposition

* State-of-the-art AI capabilities
* Consistent, high-quality responses
* Regular improvements and updates
* All for a fraction of what individual API usage would cost

# The Bottom Line

Anyone claiming they're getting scammed or that the subscription isn't worth it is, frankly, delusional. The value proposition here is insane - you just need to learn how to properly interact with the AI. Those 4 euros I spent in TypingMind for a SINGLE DAY really puts things in perspective.

Here's another way to look at it: Even if my TypingMind usage was cut in HALF, we're still talking about ‚Ç¨40-60/month for the same capabilities you get with the Claude subscription. The subscription would STILL be an insane value proposition even if it cost twice as much as it does now. The fact that we're getting this level of AI capability for the current price is honestly mind-blowing.

Instead of complaining about limits, maybe we should be sharing tips on how to get the most out of our subscriptions. The tool is incredible; we just need to learn how to use it properly.

My mom taught me well to be cautious of people, so I automatically assume every man is a sexual predator and every woman wants to take advantage of me - that's not true and I don't want this believe to destroy my perception of people. I struggle building and maintaining friendships.

On the other hand, I'm naturally very naive and believe people are good. This automatically makes me a good target so being more cautious around people is kind of good but I need to get some insight.

What are some red flags? How to spot a dangerous person?

To give you more context - I listed some old items like a lamp and other stuff online for sale. A friendly guy came to pick it up but it seemed strange that he asked me about my son - ""So you have a son? Oh that's great!"" and there was some lady in the car waiting for him. A few days passed and he wrote me a part of the lamp is missing. So I searched for a piece and then let him know I found it. He was super happy about it and then wrote me something like ""Hope you don't mind, I don't want to sound rude but you are very nice and I would like to ask you out for a coffee. I know your partner won't be happy about it but I know I have to try, I like to get to know people and I like you.""

I have a husband and a child so I'm not looking for a relationship and he must know. But I replied that I admire his courage but I don't feel comfortable to go out with a complete stranger. So I would like to learn more about him first and keep our relationship in the friend zone.

He replied that he understands but would like to meet or at least have a call because he needs to hear the intonation of the voice and stuff like this. He seems to believe a person's eyes mean a lot and one meeting tells more than a hundred text messages. And I kind of aggree with him but I simply feel scared.

He overall seems fine, he has 6 nephews and likes kids and also has a dog and multiple cats, he travelled trough Mexico - not much information yet but he seems interesting.

I don't want to waste an opportunity for a friendship where someone seems genuinely interested in me (he is interested in my art) but I'm also scared he may be some creep who ""collects"" women. A friendly creep who now knows where I live.....

You know what I mean? As I women, I'm naturally more cautious and I have trouble reading signs about his intentions.",2,1732455987.0,AutismInWomen,3,0.75,False

We‚Äôre designing a multifunctional bed for small apartments and people who move frequently and would really appreciate your feedback. Traditional beds take up too much space and can be a hassle to assemble, so we‚Äôre rethinking the concept.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve come up with:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Modular Storage Boxes will be included in both beds

* Built-in storage at the bottom of the bed.
* These boxes can be¬†easily slid out¬†and double (or even triple) as:
   * Storage compartments,
   * Small coffee tables,
   * Maybe even extra seating¬†when needed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Bed idea 1:** Transforming Side Panel

* One side of the bed opens upward to give you quick access to extra storage space.
* The side panel itself transforms into multiple uses:
   * Fully-open:¬†It becomes a¬†bench¬†for seating, great for guests.
   * Half-open:¬†It works as a¬†bedside table¬†for drinks, books, or other essentials.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Bed idea 2:** The bed is made up of modular blocks, so it‚Äôs quick and hassle-free to set up or take apart‚Äîperfect for people who move often.

* These blocks aren‚Äôt just for the bed! You can repurpose them into other furniture, like:
   * A¬†table
   * Chairs
   * A¬†room divider
   * Shelf
* This way, your furniture adapts as your needs or living space change.

What Do You Think?

* Would you use these features?
* Which matters more:¬†ease of assembly¬†or the extra functions?
* What‚Äôs missing that would make this bed perfect for your needs?

Third- They stay exercising. They come in for a morning workout and it‚Äôs usually yoga sculpt or cardio. Then they come back in the afternoon for weights.

Yesterday two men got into the line. It didn‚Äôt occur to me that they were together at first.

When they got up to the checkouts they were talking really shady to the checkout clerk. Very VERY nasty!

The lady directly behind them got into the interaction and told the unruly guys to lay off talking to her like that. 


She seemed like she intimidated by them and overwhelmed.

So this went on for five or six minutes before someone came to her aide. 

The manager berated her for not ‚Äú taking control of the situation ‚Äú. And when the lady that was defending her against the assholes, she was told to mind her own business or she would be banned from the store.

Meanwhile‚Ä¶ the two idiots got away with treating the poor checkout clerk unkind.

My question is can I report the manager for how she treated the employee? It was harsh. Instead of being kind, she embarrassed her.

My (Lates 20sF) mother in law died a few days ago, and it's meant she's being buried on my birthday. I am angry and hurt, as while I logically know it is not personal I can't help but to take it personally. 

The thing which hurts the most is she would have remembered, and chosen something else but nobody else did. She was a kind, funny human who I loved very much. We spoke regularly and went on coffee dates together. Her family are grieving but I'm finding it hard not to be upset at the situation, and with them. 

My husband, kind as he is, tried to make me dinner as a way to celebrate (which had been the original plan though also not really what I wanted) but it all just felt so hopeless and like he'd done it because he felt sorry for me? His mum just died, and while I want a fuss made usually, I also don't? If that makes sense? My emotions feel contradictory. I have a lot of sadness already surrounding my birthday due to my past trauma and I'm sure this comes across as extremely immature. 

It seems like it would suck to do something and also suck to not do something. I can't help but conflate the two events in my head.

A couple nights ago, I read the posts here. They deeply resonated, though of course our situations are not identical.

I wrote about possibly \[for anyone who wants\] remembering to connect/message/whatever on holidays/b-days. And I even envisioned that, maybe, some folks might eventually realize they don‚Äôt live too far from one another and could decide to meet for coffee someplace‚Äî‚Äîyou know, try to form a casual ‚Äúfamily‚Äù amongst whoever is interested, in whatever distant or closer way some might want.

\*Then\* I remembered: I‚Äôm an older (45+) redditor who didn‚Äôt grow up with messaging tech‚Äîso, for that reason, & other bigger reasons, I now always feel some weird hesitation about communicating even with the nicest people whom I don‚Äôt yet know.

But, I‚Äôm determined to get over that and reconnect with people generally.

So, anyway, maybe some of us might consider some of that‚Äîpossibly? (By the way, if I‚Äôm really confused & posting na√Øve nonsense here, just ignore or let me know.)

So, let‚Äôs chat about how to make this [**Thanksgiving pet-friendly**](https://thepetlabco.com/learn/blog/thanksgiving-safety-tips-for-pets)‚Äî

# ü•ß Watch Out for Dangerous Foods

We know those puppy-dog eyes are hard to resist, but not everything on your Thanksgiving table is safe for dogs. Here‚Äôs what to avoid:

* **Chocolate & Candy:** Chocolate (especially dark) and anything with xylitol (a sweetener) are *highly toxic*. Signs of trouble? Vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, or a rapid heartbeat. Keep these treats far from your pup!
* **Raw Dough & Pumpkin Pie:** Raw bread dough can expand in your dog‚Äôs tummy, causing serious issues. And while cooked pumpkin is great for dogs, raw pumpkin or canned varieties with additives are a no-go.
* **Turkey Bones & Skin:** A little boneless, cooked turkey is fine, but bones can splinter and harm their digestive tract. Stick to plain, well-cooked meat‚Äîno seasoning!
* **Toxic Ingredients:** Grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, avocados, and even coffee are all dangerous. If your dog accidentally snacks on these, call your vet immediately.

# üéÉ Decor Dangers

Thanksgiving d√©cor is fun, but it can be risky for pets:

* **Pumpkins & Corn:** Not toxic, but too much can upset their stomach.
* **Candles & Small Decorations:** Easily knocked over by curious tails or paws, creating a fire or choking hazard.
* **Festive Plants:** Watch out for Chrysanthemums, Oak Tree Acorns, and Autumn Crocus in centerpieces‚Äîthese are toxic to dogs.

# üöó Traveling With Your Pup?

Planning a Thanksgiving road trip? Keep your dog‚Äôs comfort and safety in mind:

* Bring their medical records, a pet first-aid kit, and ID tags.
* Look up the nearest emergency vet at your destination.
* Nervous traveler? Give them a cozy spot with their blanket and toys to feel secure.

# üè° Hosting Guests

Thanksgiving gatherings can be overwhelming for pets:

* Set up a quiet room where your dog can chill with their bed, water, and toys.
* Keep an eye on the door‚Äîexcited pups might make a dash for freedom!

Thanksgiving is all about gratitude, and what better way to show our furry friends how much we love them than by making the day safe and stress-free?

1gyqzb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1gyqzb3/preparation/,Preparation,"Hello fellow sufferers,

as I am now also a member of the club, I wanted to support the community with my experiences. Especially with things I would have liked to have known before the surgery. There is already a pinned post here that contains things to buy. I would like to extend this with organizational topics. I live in Germany, but maybe this is also useful for other countries. I live alone, but I have nice people here in the house who help me. If you live with your partner, a lot of this is much easier.

# Helpful things:

Crutches: I got them on prescription from the doctor. Call the medical supply store beforehand and ask if they can bill your health insurance. This may save you a trip or two.

Hand pads for crutches: If you get forearm crutches, you will have pain in your hands after a few days. Unfortunately, I didn't have any pads.

Raised toilet seat: Trust me, the first few days without it were very uncomfortable.

The sock trick: watch the video: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1gmnivc/hack\_for\_putting\_on\_socks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1gmnivc/hack_for_putting_on_socks/) I posted it some days ago. It's not mine, but it helped me a lot. Practice makes perfect. If there's one thing you have in abundance, it's time. Of course, you can also get yourself a fancy sock tool that will disappear into some box after 3 weeks.

Shoes: Tying shoes is not possible. As I don't have any shoes that don't need tying, I always put the laces in my shoes. What was also very helpful was a long shoehorn.

Comfortable clothes: loose jogging pants are a must. I've also read in the comments here about pants that you can button at the side. Like these Adidas pants used to be. Very practical if you can't bend down.

Transportation within the home: As you don't have your hands free with crutches, you need a way to transport food, drink and other things. I have always hung a canvas bag around my neck for this purpose. A rucksack would also work.

Tupperware: If you don't want to eat standing up in the kitchen, you need to transport it somewhere. Various containers have helped me here. You can stack them nicely in your bag. Just be creative. I made my coffee in a jam jar, for example. If you don't want to eat out of tins, you should get yourself a serving trolley.

Food: I couldn't sit at the table for 5 minutes at the beginning. A tray with feet was very practical for eating on the couch.

Wound care: I ordered the 10x15cm from Hansaplast (PZN: 16760084). They covered both of my wounds at once. I used Suprasorb F (PZN: 01806248) for showering. Two simple plasters on the wounds and then the film over them. Be sure to remove it again after showering. (Don't ask me how I know this :D)

# Preparation:

Household: Do your household beforehand! Wash your laundry. Clean the apartment. Tidy up the kitchen and go to the surgery with an empty dishwasher.

Shopping: Buy non-perishable items or freeze things. You cannot go shopping yourself or are dependent on help. As you are not allowed to eat or drink before the operation, dextrose was very helpful for my circulation. Take water and a snack with you on the way home.

Pre-cooking: I bought lots of ingredients to take care of myself after the operation. But standing in the kitchen is very exhausting. With two healthy legs, you unconsciously move back and forth between the stove, sink, worktop and cupboards. It's not so easy with two crutches. So cook dishes in advance and freeze them. Delivery services are of course also possible, but as I live in a very rural area, there are no good ones here. And it's expensive. Another option is ""food on wheels"" (Essen auf R√§dern). You can think of it like a canteen, only you get the food delivered every day. It's particularly popular with the elderly. My grandparents had it. Inexpensive, tasty and varied.

Toenails: Cut your toenails beforehand. You won't be able to reach them for a while.

PT appointments: Make appointments in advance. Here in my area, waiting times of a month or more are not uncommon. Some even stop taking patients. Canceling or rescheduling appointments is easier.

# Mental:

Musculature: You will lose muscle in your operated leg. And not just a little. I noticed this very strongly after 2 weeks. I was a bit shocked.

For men: You may not be able to feel your genitals or penis for a while. For me, the feeling came back slowly after 2 weeks. Now, after 3.5 weeks it's not 100% yet, but we're getting closer. I don't know whether the similar applies to women. Maybe someone can add that in the comments.

Time: You will be slow and cautious. Everything takes 3-4 times as long. If you have appointments, plan enough time to get ready.

Sleep: I was not able to sleep in bed. Too much room to move. I learned this painfully. I was then able to sleep very well on the couch. Lying on my back, my operated leg wedged between the backrest and some pillows, my healthy leg on the pillows. After two weeks, I felt confident enough to get back into bed. Lying on my side, the healthy leg down, the operated leg on a side sleeper pillow. If you don't have one of these, you can also roll up a blanket.

Fitness: After the shock of muscle atrophy, I started exercising relatively early. Without putting any weight on my hips, of course. I put weight cuffs on my feet and then lifted and lowered my lower leg while sitting. I then did the same movement while lying on my stomach. Thera-bands were also useful. Just try it out and see what feels good.



That's all I can think of at the moment. I think there will be a few other useful tips in the comments.

Childhood. Fuck, it was beautiful. Running around the void deck with sweaty, grubby hands, shouting and laughing until our voices cracked. The smell of fried rice wafting up from someone‚Äôs window, the sky turning from golden to deep purple as the streetlights flickered on. Life then felt alive, full of colors, full of something real. I didn‚Äôt know what stress was. I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to feel this constant fucking weight pressing down on my chest. Now, all that‚Äôs left is this gray, lifeless routine. Everything is just so goddamn dull.

I‚Äôm standing at the traffic light, watching it blink, red to green, green to red, like some broken heartbeat. Cars crawl past, their engines humming like background noise in a bad dream. Everything moves in slow motion, but somehow it‚Äôs still too fast. The lights seem tired, like they‚Äôre stuck in a loop they can‚Äôt escape. Cars roll by, one after another, like they‚Äôre on some invisible track. The smell of exhaust hangs in the air, mixing with the faint stench of damp pavement. It‚Äôs depressing as hell. Around me, life fucking goes on. People rush past with their coffee in hand, their faces glued to their phones, not giving a shit about anything around them. The city is alive, but it feels like a corpse‚Äîsoulless, mechanical, fake. Around me, people rush past, their faces blank, their conversations shallow.
Rachmaninoff 2 plays in my headphones, each note heavy as if it‚Äôs sinking into the ground. I look around. 

At the hawker centre, it‚Äôs the same chaotic symphony. It‚Äôs bustling, trays clattering, the smell of stale grease clinging to the humid air. Trays clack against tables, bowls scrape as people slurp down noodles, and uncles shout over each other about some new GST hike. People eating, talking loudly, their words blending into an indecipherable hum. There‚Äôs this young girl, maybe 17 or 18, wiping tables like it‚Äôs her destiny. Her expression is hollow, her movements robotic. I can‚Äôt help but wonder: where are her parents? Does she even have a life outside this? How the fuck does someone end up here? But no one notices her. No one cares. Life moves on. Always, it fucking moves on.

Singapore,this city, this concrete jungle‚Äîit‚Äôs so clean, so orderly, so perfect on the outside, but it‚Äôs suffocating. Everything is man-made. Every tree, every park, every ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù view-planned, engineered, fabricated. There‚Äôs no chaos, no rawness, no soul. It‚Äôs like living in a glass cage. And yet, I can‚Äôt live without it. It‚Äôs like Stockholm syndrome‚Äîthis city strangles me, yet I crave it. I hate it, but I need it.

The grind never stops here. Singapore feels so goddamn bland sometimes. Everyone‚Äôs chasing something‚Äîmoney, prestige, grades, ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. Efficient, they call it. Bullshit. It‚Äôs suffocating. But we still live in it. Even if it kills them. Even if it kills me. But fuck, what‚Äôs the alternative? I think about other places, other lives, and it feels like they‚Äôd be worse. At least here, the system works, even if it‚Äôs killing us. Everyone‚Äôs obsessed with the grind, the rat race, and I‚Äôm stuck in the middle of it, trying not to lose my shit. But at the same time, I need it. I need this fucked-up system to feel like I‚Äôm worth something. It‚Äôs like some toxic relationship I can‚Äôt escape.

I think about my life. My PSLE was a mess. I didn‚Äôt take it seriously, didn‚Äôt study, didn‚Äôt give a shit. And I paid the price. Shitty grades, shitty school, surrounded by people who couldn‚Äôt care less about anything but the next TikTok trend. Delinquents on fixie bikes, vaping in stairwells, making cringy-ass satki CapCut edits of themselves with fucking chinese or malay EDM music playing the background. It‚Äôs pathetic. Sometimes I look at them and wonder: how the fuck did I end up here? How did I let myself sink this low?

PSLE was supposed to be a chance, a gateway, but I blew it. Don‚Äôt tell me it doesn‚Äôt matter. It does. It‚Äôs a fucking label, a brand burned into your skin, a mark you cant shake off. It screams ‚Äúfailure‚Äù no matter how much you try to move on. When people hear what school you‚Äôre from, they make assumptions. They think they know you. And I hate that. I fucking hate it. So now, I‚Äôm working my ass off, trying to climb out of this hole. Trying to prove I‚Äôm not the failure everyone thinks I am. I dream of making it into a top JC, wearing that uniform like it‚Äôs a badge of honour. But every step forward feels like climbing a mountain barefoot.

Sometimes I think about how different life could‚Äôve been. What if I was reincarnated as a Singaporean baby, but retaining all my current knowledge? I‚Äôd ace PSLE, enter a top school, win math and science competitions (maybe for primary school only), and become the pride of my family. Every Chinese New Year, my relatives would gush about me‚Äîthe golden child, the one who ‚Äúmade it.‚Äù But nah, that‚Äôs just some fantasy shit.

But even now, life keeps throwing punches. My subject combination? Not what I wanted. They gave me shit I‚Äôm good at but have no interest in. It‚Äôs like being forced to eat food you hate every day. How am I supposed to find motivation in this? Everything feels meaningless, but I can‚Äôt afford to give up.

Sometimes, I wonder if life is even real. Is this it? Is this all there is? What if we‚Äôre just lab rats in some giant experiment, watched by higher beings who laugh at our struggles? The blinking traffic lights, the moving cars, the constant hum of city life, it all feels like some twisted simulation, like none of it is real. What if we‚Äôre just programmed to keep moving, keep grinding, until we burn out?

Rachmaninoff 2 swells in my ears, the melancholy washing over me like a wave. Time slows down. The world feels heavy, like it‚Äôs dragging me under.  The music‚Äôs sadness crawling into my chest. The traffic lights change again‚Äîred, green, red. The clock is ticking, time fleeting faster than ever before. I want to give up, and yet, I keep walking. I keep pushing forward, not because I want to, but because I have to. The city owns me, and I fucking hate it, but I can‚Äôt escape it. Life just goes on, whether I‚Äôm ready or not.

Probably a relative easy ask but I already failed once and my fuse in the fusebox jumped hehe.

Ok, I want to add an 12v led light for the tank and to see the coffee better!

Photo 1:

I see on photo 1 multiple wires.

I see a brown + red wire connected to 1 pin. Is this the plus or minus wire?

Secondly I see the blue/ grew wire. Which one is this?

What to connect where from my photo 3 adapter to 12v, if I don‚Äôt hookup a led immediately can I already connect the adapter only? LED still shipping :)

On photo 2 from top to bottom there are 4 connectors;
1 blue/grey
2 red
3 - 2 blue / grey wires 
4 - black wire 

From my 12v adapter, which goes where?

What I did that failed immediately when I turned on the machine;

I put the black wire on photo 1 on the brown and red wire.

On photo 2 I‚Äôve put the red wire on the #1 wire blue/grey.

Sorry to ask you all, thanks :-)

But when I try to share my frustrations, people either ignore me or dismiss what I‚Äôm saying. Over time, I‚Äôve learned to handle this and set boundaries, which has helped me manage most social interactions.

However, there‚Äôs this one colleague who‚Äôs been a unique challenge. He‚Äôs struggling with depression and seems to connect only with people who insult him‚Äîgenuine insults, not playful banter. Despite this, I tried to be supportive, offering positive advice over coffee for months, even though we weren‚Äôt particularly close. He often went out of his way for people who exploited him, and I never took advantage of that, though I did try to point it out indirectly.

Things changed after I gave him constructive criticism for some mistakes at work. Oddly enough, he started acting like we were close friends, but I soon realized he only values relationships where he‚Äôs insulted or berated. To him, that‚Äôs how genuine friendships work. I couldn‚Äôt keep up with that dynamic and went back to my usual, neutral self.

Last week, I hadn‚Äôt slept for a couple of days due to work stress and ended up venting to him while we were eating. His response shocked me. Instead of supporting me or even joking to lighten the mood, he started gaslighting me. He mocked my choices, said I‚Äôd fail because I wasn‚Äôt working harder, and even criticized me for standing up to my boss (who is actually understanding).

Out of curiosity, I tested his reaction further by sharing some past frustrations about work and how I handled them. He doubled down, mocking me for not ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù my job and claiming I should ""simp"" for people to find meaning. At that point, all I could do was laugh it off.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson: toxic people can‚Äôt handle help, and if you show vulnerability, they‚Äôll use it to drag you down. I‚Äôm proud I didn‚Äôt let him get under my skin, but I‚Äôve decided to distance myself. From now on, I‚Äôll keep interactions strictly professional‚Äîsmall talk and boring topics to keep him at arm‚Äôs length.

It‚Äôs frustrating but also eye-opening. Have you ever dealt with someone like this? How did you handle it?

I'm still wondering, weather to tell myself, such people are part of life and consider a lesson or this just changing me as a person. I myself struggled with anxiety, panicking for years before making it in life, but now this kinda situations just making me feel worse.",3,1732454265.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

If you look beyond the shroud, a magical world will be opened to you, filled with fantastical creature flying between skyscrapers, and dragon-born lawyers preparing a coffee while getting ready for work. The G.U.I.L.D. has recently reopened, hoping some bright and fresh mind are able to assist the city with its matters. Matters related to scheming, thieving, pinching and a dark creature looking over the city, wishing to claim it's revenge on the protector of it all.

Join the G.U.I.L.D. today, and have access to the following:

1gyqq84,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1gyqq84/i_work_for_a_company_called_rml/,I work for a company called RML,"RML is basically just an Amazon flex job but you have to work 4 days a week, 10hour shifts, atleast one weekend day. And a perk is you choose what days you work! 

   I get written up for any minor mistake made while on the road. (Which I get) So far I‚Äôve been written up two times and it‚Äôs only been 3-4 weeks lol. Yes I need to be more mindful to not make mistakes. I suppose I earned those write ups. 

   BUT, today I was on the schedule to arrive for ‚Äúcycle 0 at 7:45 so I woke up did my daily routine: coffee, shower stretching, had breakfast chugged half a monster. To prepare and get a good start I like 2.5 hours to start my day before heading to work.. 

   I walk in and greet dispatch he‚Äôs friendly back, and then he finally says oh we don‚Äôt have anything for you to do till 10:00am.. basically saying he or someone messed you up. This puts a huge damper on my day I now have to drive back home wait around for 2 hours then start my day turning my 10 hour day into a 12 hour day and ruining my routine for that day and I have a disability and I need routine! I also just think this is unacceptable if I am held to a certain level of excellence then shouldn‚Äôt dispatch also be held to that. That is my time and my mental health on the line here. You can‚Äôt tell someone to come in by 8:00am then tell them to turn around and come back at 10am can you?? 

My write ups btw were from training day my trainer told me I was not required to wear a seat belt in the passenger seat but I did anyways because I always do!! unfortunately I did forget to put it on once and so did my trainer so I got the write up since we were signed in under my name not hers. I took it with minimal protest. And didn‚Äôt snitch out the trainer. I just said it‚Äôs my first day! Really? And then signed it.. 

The second write up came end of last week when I was driving on roads with no speed limit signs all day! And when there is no marked speed limit the app says 30mph and on those roads everyone is driving FAST! so realistically I can‚Äôt drive 30! so I pull out my phone to see if it says anything different it said 55 so I started driving 40-45 on those roads to be realistic and safe! Well end of my route I come across a street that I guess changed to 25 at the end of it while I was navigating because I was getting close to turn onto the street that the house would be on and I missed the sign so I started driving in that ‚Äúsafe‚Äù range I had mentioned above. (She clocked me at 42-43) and I got a write up. 
   She texted me and said ‚Äúviolation yada yada!‚Äù I said ‚Äúthat was an abrupt speed change, but yea I know‚Äù acknowledging my mistake but also like darn! lol‚Ä¶
   
   After I arrive back to the station I return their work bag and she tells me to go to the desk I said f‚ÄùI know for my write up‚Äù like acknowledging or whatever, idk I‚Äôm a talker ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è then I go to the man at the other desk like I‚Äôm here for my write up (:ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è like what are ya gonna do. We all know I was speeding whether it was an accident or not I‚Äôll sign it whatever! 
  She proceeded to call back over to her desk as I was trying to sign the damn paper and call me a liar, more or less, she along the lines of there was no way I didn‚Äôt see the sign yada yada. I said I was navigating. After the second accusation I said sweetie I was navigating and walked away to sign the write up like leave me alone weird bitch why would I be speeding on purpose psycho! obviously I didn‚Äôt say that part. 
     I had intended to sign with no protest in the first place but she wanted to accuse me of lieing and she also had told me earlier that day to ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù when she was unable to assist me with my first rescue. So when I called her sweetie that made her mad and she suspended me‚Ä¶

Im here trying to seek perspective on this whole situation and guidance how to proceed diplomatically so that I may set a standard for what I expect in return for my compliance and employment. 
This is a give and take and I won‚Äôt tolerate abuse. Or to be treated like my time doesn‚Äôt matter. 
Also She can be rude to me but I get suspended for defending myself and giving a little bit of attitude back? This specific supervisor is constantly complaining about her job responsibilities whenever I walk up to the desk also bashing DSPs she‚Äôs never been helpful to me when I‚Äôve called looking for guidance. She‚Äôs down right mean and condescending to dsps in morning meetings. this leads to negative environment and low morale within the company in my opinion.",1,1732454193.0,AmazonDSPDrivers,2,1.0,False

I just want to know how you guys try to cheer your loved ones up.

I'll start with one: the other day, I used a rideshare to take my mom and I to a fancy mall in the city for lunch. We walked around and windowshopped, had lunch at a nice Japanese place, and even had coffee and desserts there, too. It was a nice couple of hours out of the house where we stay in for most of the week (neither one of us likes going out much, to be honest).

I hope to make this a regular weekly thing, you know? Even if only something as simple as taking mom to a fancy coffee place that neither one of us has been to before, for a couple of Americanos and a slice of cake.

>From 1900 - 1909 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales

>Location Andreas, Isle of Man, England

>**Date: 1901** Time: daytime

>The young pre-teenage son of a local farming family named **John disappeared one day while out in the fields.** Villagers searched but found no trace of him, and the family suffered accordingly. **Then, out of the blue, four years after his disappearance, John wandered into the farmhouse, looking barely a day older, utterly disbelieving of the amount of time that his parents insisted had passed.** According to John‚Äô story, strange little men had rendered him senseless in the field. He next found himself in their ‚Äúland.‚Äù He could not explain where he now was except that the little men could show him the lives of his family. He was able to describe to family members some of the things they had been up to (including a trip to Ramsey corn market); **but while he was in captivity, all his attempts to communicate with them failed. He could observe but not directly interact, despite various almost ghost-like attempts to alert his family. John said he lost all sense of time** during this sojourn.

From The Healing Power of UFOs by Preston Dennett

>On the afternoon of July 12, 1975, four friends (Richard, Pat, Nancy and Ross), were having lunch in a crowded coffee bar in Dunedin, New Zealand. The weather was cold and damp, and all of them were suffering from various degrees of the flu. One of them suffered from a migraine headache. There were, they estimated, about eighty people sitting at various tables around them.

>**As they ate together, something very strange happened. Time stopped. Everyone around them became perfectly still and unmoving, however, the four friends could still move.** Richard was struck by the sight of unmoving steam above the espresso machine, and by the sight of a waitress frozen in place as she bent over an oven pulling out hotcakes.

>(SNIP)

>Staring around in shock, the four of them saw a strange figure appear at the top of the stairs on the opposite side of the room, which was the only public entrance and exit to the restaurant. He appeared to be a young man about six feet tall, slender, with black wavy hair, and olive skin. He was tastefully dressed in normal clothes and seemed to have a whitish aura of light glowing around him. They watched him float down the staircase, levitate across the room to the end of the line, where customers waited for their food.

>**The moment the man got into the line, time began to flow normally again. The four friends watched as the people around them moved normally without any indication or awareness that something strange had just happened.**

>Date: 1970

>Time: night

>12-year old Frank was watching television in his upstairs bedroom with his back to the double window. Suddenly he felt the strongest sensation of someone watching him from behind. When he turned around, he got the shock of his life. He saw standing on the roof of the house directly next door and to the left of his own‚Äîa gray alien peering from the opposite side of the roof at him through the double windows.

>his house and the house next door when he saw a gray up on top of the neighbor‚Äôs rooftop. When he noticed it‚Äîhe watched in awe and shock as **he noticed each one of his friends had been frozen in suspended animation**. Just then the witness saw the alien ‚Äúfloat like a feather‚Äù down towards the ground in front of him. At the very moment when it would have hit the ground, it simply disappeared in front of his eyes. **In looking at his friends he noticed that they were now unfrozen and went about their playing unaware that anything had ever occurred. None of his other friends saw this take place.**

>Time: 0100A

>Traveling on an isolated road truck driver Osvaldo D‚ÄôAnuncio when after about 20 minutes of non-stop driving when something made him look up. He then saw a fiery white sphere of fire descending at high speed from the sky.

Also several telephone lines in the area were found severed and melted apparently along the object‚Äôs trajectory. **One last strange detail was that D‚ÄôAnuncio managed to drive a distance of 8km in only 2 minutes.**

From the book ‚ÄúOur Haunted Planet"" by journalist John Keel

>A woman in Allentown, Pennsylvania, soberly related this strange story; she said she and her husband maintained a small summer cottage in the Pocono mountains, a mere thirty-minute drive from their home. One Saturday morning in July 1966, the young couple got into their car and started out for the cottage. **As they drove along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which seemed strangely devoid of traffic that day,** they saw a large circular object in the sky ahead of them.

>(SNIP)

>**In occult and UFO lore there are hundreds of reports of this phenomenon. It also seems to work in reverse. Witnesses claim that they drove or even walked incredible distances - sometimes hundreds of miles - in incredibly short periods of time. It is as if they crossed over into another dimension where time and space have a different relationship.**

From the book ‚ÄúThe Custodians"" (about UFO abductions) by Delores Cannon

>Many investigators have explored cases of missing time, where several hours pass inexplicably without the person being aware of the lapse. I will discuss several later in this book. **But I have discovered a concept which I find even stranger: cases of condensed time. This is where the events take place in far less time than it would normally take.** Of course, both of these phenomena are examples of time being mysteriously distorted from the participant's point of view. We are hampered by being trapped within our concept of linear time. It has been said we may be the only planet in the universe that has invented a way to measure something that does not exist. **I have been told many times in my work that time is only an illusion, an invention of man. The aliens do not have this concept, and they have told me that man will never travel in space until he overcomes the erroneous idea of time.**

>(SNIP)

>A woman named Janet called him to relate a strange occurrence the night before in his area. The woman was very apprehensive and did not want to identify herself. **She told him she had traveled from Little Rock to her home, which was past the Conway area, in only fifteen minutes time. As it is a distance of approximately 50 miles, the trip normally took 45 minutes. There was no traffic on the four lane interstate highway the entire way, which was very unusual**

>(SNIP)

>I was certain she had checked the strange occurrence of condensed time, and she had. She seemed the type who wanted to verify every possible detail to satisfy her own curiosity. She had already double-checked with several people who verified the time she left a restaurant in Little Rock that evening. It was around midnight when she got on 1-40, and drove down the freeway until she came to the road that turned off to her home. **There is only one road in or out of that area, and there is always traffic no matter what time of the day or night**. She is very familiar with every twist and turn, and knows every house along the way, since she drives this route almost every day. **But that night everything seemed strange and different. There weren't any stars out, and she noticed it was extremely quiet. There was not even the sound of crickets. She distinctly noticed there were no lights in any of the houses, not even the outside mercury vapor lights which always burn. She knew this area very well, and there were always lights in the houses which could be seen for long distances. There was no sound and no sign of life. There was no traffic, which she considered to be very unusual.**

>Then she saw the object. It was huge, suspended just above the treetops ahead of her to her right. It was an enormous oblong shape, and glowing a very distinct bright orange color.

>(SNIP)

>When she entered the house she was surprised to see the time. She went through the house checking all the clocks against her watch, and they all said the same thing. **She had arrived home much too quickly. She estimated fifteen minutes, which would have been impossible, especially at the slow rate of speed she was traveling.**

>(SNIP)

>**I investigated another case that occurred in the city of Little Rock, as a woman was going to work on a busy highway during rush hour traffic. She saw a huge capsule-shaped craft suddenly appear directly in front of her in the sky. She thought it would cause most of the traffic to come to a screeching halt. Instead everything was proceeding normally. There were joggers running by on the sidewalk, and she frantically waved and shouted at them from her car. She tried to get their attention, and kept pointing upward. They continued jogging as though she was invisible.** She pulled her car over to the curb, and watched the craft do several drastic gyrations, and fly away. **No one else paid any attention to it, although it was huge.** She was not abducted, and nothing else happened during the event. I investigated a case in 1997 half a world away in England that was identical in all respects. Do these aliens have the ability to create an individual experience that no one else is allowed to witness?

>(SNIP)

>These incidents, however, seem to be a different type of experience from Janet's. **Eddie's world still had movement in it. Janet's did not. The world around her had stopped, while her private world continued. It was almost as though she was moving faster than the dimension she normally lived in. Everything in that world appeared to stop, because it was moving at a slower vibration.** Almost as though she was slipping and sliding through dimensions. The following case is another example.

>(SNIP)

>Frightened, Val put the car into reverse, turned around and headed toward the city. As she reached the highway the white glowing object moved and paced them on the passenger side of the car. It did not maintain any particular shape. It seemed to change, but remained a very white, luminous, glowing light. She drove faster, determined to reach the city as quickly as possible. **Then she noticed a strange phenomenon. There was no traffic in either lane, and no lights. (This sounded surprisingly similar to Janet's experience.) The unusual situation continued when she turned off the highway and entered the city. She then saw that the street lights were going out one by one as she approached them, and yet she could see to drive. Nothing was moving, neither the grass nor the trees. There was only an eerie silence. They saw no dogs, no cats, no other cars, no people, no lights in any of the houses. It was as if they were the only people in the world, a weird ""twilight zone"" feeling. She described it as being in a vacuum: no sound, no movement, nothing.** The street lights were off in the area they passed through, yet there was a soft radiating light coming from somewhere above them. They were determined to get someplace where there were other people. They went by a large shopping mall where there was an all-night restaurant. **The object then hovered over the mall. As they drove by the restaurant they noticed there was no sign of life, although it was open 24 hours a day. There were no lights and no people anywhere. As they drove on they did not meet any cars or see any people. Even though it was late normally there was always someone on the streets in the city.** Out of desperation they decided to go to a friend's office downtown. He often worked late at night, and they knew he would be there. **When they entered the office their world returned to normal.**

This new article dated 11-18-2024, mentions that scientists may have found a theoretical way to alter ""traditional time"" using quantum entanglement and vibrating magnets.

From [Time may be an illusion, new study finds - The Brighter Side of News](https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/time-may-be-an-illusion-new-study-finds/)

>Researchers propose that time is a result of quantum entanglement, the mysterious connection between particles separated by vast distances. Their findings, published in the journal Physical Review A, could offer a clue to solving the problem of time.

>(snip)

>To address this, the researchers revisited the Page and Wootters mechanism, a theory proposed in 1983. **It suggests that time emerges through quantum entanglement between one object and another acting as a clock. In an unentangled system, time does not exist,** and the universe appears frozen and unchanging.

>Applying this mechanism to two entangled but noninteracting theoretical quantum states‚Äî**a vibrating harmonic oscillator and a set of tiny magnets acting as a clock**‚Äîthe researchers found their system aligned perfectly with the Schr√∂dinger equation, which predicts the behavior of quantum objects. **Instead of traditional time, their version of the equation ran according to the states of the tiny magnets.**

>While this concept isn't entirely new, the team's next step was groundbreaking. They repeated their calculations, assuming first that the magnet clock and then the harmonic oscillator were macroscopic objects. The equations simplified into those used in classical physics, **suggesting that time's flow is a consequence of entanglement even on large scales.**",7,1732452042.0,InterdimensionalNHI,2,0.82,False

1gyq2jm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyq2jm,Embracing the Whole Self: A Journey to Inner Peace ‚Ä¢ [Click to Expand],"## Let's dive into the concept of self-acceptance, 


a philosophical journey that invites us to embrace every facet of our being, both the admirable and the less so. Imagine sitting with a friend over coffee, discussing the intricacies of accepting oneself wholly‚Äîflaws, quirks, and all. This conversation is about understanding that self-acceptance isn't just about acknowledging our strengths but also about making peace with our weaknesses.

At its core, self-acceptance means recognizing and embracing all aspects of oneself, both positive and negative. It's like looking in a mirror and seeing not just the reflection but the stories behind every line and curve. It's about understanding one's strengths and weaknesses while feeling satisfied with who you are, regardless of imperfections or past actions.

The Dance Between Self-Acceptance and Self-Esteem

Let's start by differentiating self-acceptance from its close cousin, self-esteem. Self-esteem is about how we value ourselves‚Äîdo we see ourselves as worthy or valuable? In contrast, self-acceptance is more about acknowledging who we are without judgment. It's a global affirmation of self that doesn't just focus on the positive but embraces the entire spectrum of our being.

Think of it this way: self-esteem might be the spotlight shining on your achievements, while self-acceptance is the warm glow that envelops you even when you're offstage. It's about saying to yourself, ""I am enough,"" even when you stumble or fall short.

Embracing Our Shadow

Carl Jung's concept of the ""shadow"" offers a profound insight into self-acceptance. According to Jung, the shadow represents the parts of ourselves we often hide or deny‚Äîour fears, insecurities, and darker impulses. Embracing our shadow means acknowledging these aspects as integral parts of who we are.

Imagine your shadow as an old friend you've lost touch with. Reconnecting with this friend might be uncomfortable at first, but it's essential for genuine self-acceptance. By bringing these hidden parts into the light, we begin to understand ourselves more fully and can embark on a path toward individuation‚Äîa journey toward psychological wholeness.

Personal Anecdote: The Mirror Moment

Let me share a personal story. There was a time when I struggled with accepting my introverted nature. In social settings, I often felt inadequate compared to my more outgoing friends. It wasn't until I embraced my quiet strength that I found peace within myself. I realized that my introversion allowed me to listen deeply and connect with others in meaningful ways.

This acceptance transformed my perspective. Instead of trying to fit into a mold that wasn't meant for me, I embraced my unique qualities. This shift didn't happen overnight; it was a gradual process of learning to love myself as I am.

The Role of Self-Compassion

Self-compassion plays a crucial role in self-acceptance. It's about treating ourselves with kindness and understanding when we encounter parts of ourselves we don't particularly like. Imagine speaking to yourself as you would to a dear friend‚Äîoffering support rather than criticism.

When we practice self-compassion, we create space for healing and growth. We acknowledge that everyone has flaws and that these imperfections don't diminish our worth. This mindset allows us to approach life with greater resilience and authenticity.

Practical Steps Toward Self-Acceptance

So how do we cultivate self-acceptance in our daily lives? Here are some practical steps:

1. Self-Reflection: Take time to reflect on your strengths and weaknesses without judgment. Journaling can be a helpful tool for gaining insight into your inner world.

2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment without clinging to past regrets or future anxieties. Mindfulness helps us accept things as they are.

3. Challenge Negative Thoughts: When negative thoughts arise, challenge them by questioning their validity. Replace self-critical thoughts with affirmations that reinforce your worth.

4. Seek Support: Surround yourself with people who uplift and support you on your journey toward self-acceptance.

5. Celebrate Progress: Acknowledge small victories along the way. Every step toward self-acceptance is worth celebrating.

Conclusion: A Lifelong Journey

Self-acceptance is not a destination but a lifelong journey‚Äîa continuous process of embracing who we are at every stage of life. It's about finding balance between light and shadow, strengths and weaknesses, joy and sorrow.

As we navigate this journey, let's remember that true peace comes from within‚Äîfrom accepting ourselves wholly and unconditionally. By doing so, we open ourselves up to greater emotional well-being and fulfillment. So let's embark on this path together, hand in hand with our shadows, knowing that every part of us is worthy of love and acceptance.

My snoring is so loud that my husband has to sleep on the couch. Prior to pregnancy, I only snored if I was sick or exhausted. And it was never bad enough to need to relocate.

It has progressively gotten worse the further along I get. It has even gotten to the point where it wakes me up. My nose is always congested at night and my doctor told me to try a daily allergy pill to see if it helps. 

 I feel so bad for my husband. He tells me not to feel bad or apologize cuz this isn‚Äôt anything I can control. 
I asked him to record it and I literally sound like a lawnmower. 

I work from home and maybe have to be on site 2x a month. He works  8-10hr shifts at a laborious job that requires him to be focused as he handles dangerous equipment. He‚Äôs drinking coffee everyday now and visibly looks tired. I tell him I can sleep on the couch (cuz frankly I can sleep anywhere) and insomnia has set in and I‚Äôm usually up for a few hours every night anyway. He refuses. 
I‚Äôve tried to get him ear plugs but he is uncomfortable with that as he wants to be able to hear if something happens in or around the house at night. 

The couch isn‚Äôt that comfortable and we are trying to see if we can get a day bed for the spare room/nursery on a Black Friday sale.

(Spoilers for the new update and also late-game anomalies),"Haven't seen all this information in one place yet, so I wanted to start compiling it for anyone wondering. Goldshells are a new loot container added in Trips and Treasures - they will show up on the Resource Radar as a kind of... branchy tree, thing? The icon does kind of look like the trees themselves, which have a glow to them and will have a Goldshell hanging off it, which looks kind of like a big coffee bean and takes up a 3x3 in the inventory.

Each Goldshell will have a name that gives a hint how to open it:

**Conductive**: requires electricity. You can let a Spark Tower hit it, but don't bother if you're in any kind of hurry, because it seems to take a lot of bolts to finally crack it. A quicker way is to drop it into a Sizzling Mist and vacuum it back to you once it cracks. You can also use a Plasma Charger to open it pretty quickly, and once you get back to the Garage you can use the recharging station to open it instantly.

**Corrodible**: requires acid. Pretty much requires the midzone to open it, but either chucking it into a Rotten Egg or dropping it into a Cough Box and vacuuming it back out work fine.

**Wishbone**: requires one of the anomalies that grab things. Abductors work very well, because it seems they will actually attempt to drop it at your feet - it will take the Abductor grabbing it twice though. Bubblegum Buddies will also handle it. Haven't tested Pickpockets, but probably not, because I don't think they interact with dropped objects (they just yank pieces off your car).

**Dehydrated**: requires getting it wet. Similar to Dumpster Pearls, rain won't work but any body of water will, and if you bring one home you can use the sink at the Garage.

**Secured**: if you're in the Deep Zone, Devil Grinders make short work of this for you. I'm assuming that Can Openers will also work, though if all else fails you can open it with something like 5 hits from the Impact Hammer, even at the Garage.

**Combustible**: explosive damage for this one. Chucking it into Tourists does work, but it's very tedious because of the small amount of progress each hit gives and the chance of it flying off and making you chase it. In the Deep Zone, I've had a Tour Bus open it in a single throw (but make sure to stand back a safe distance and don't nearly kill yourself like I did.) You can also use a couple shots from the Liberator, giving you an option for opening it at the Garage.

How about it fellow drivers? Any types of shell I missed, or any other creative ways to open these things?",4,1732451473.0,pacificDrive,1,1.0,False

I've had tinnitus in the left ear for a couple years now. It took me months to get habituated to it when it started. 

It was a high-pitch hissing that wouldn't let me sleep at night so I would cover it with a water fountain. 

I've had a couple episodes of stress throughout the years that made me more aware of it for a while but it always got better.

3 weeks ago, I was having a coffee in a shop with my 4-yo son and the alarm started ringing. They said they were testing it but they couldn't stop it. 

We were 4-5m away from the source and we left after 2 min maybe. My son seemed more bothered about that fact that he couldn't finish his piece of cake. 

I was extremely pissed as I always try to avoid these situations and because of incompetent people this time I couldn't. 

I've felt like the ringing has been more intense these past weeks and even have a sensation of having it in the right ear now. 

It was in Spain so maybe the norm is different from other countries. But people told me it's very unlikely that an alarm could provoke damage at such a distance. It was probably calibrated for 100 or 105db. 

I don't know if the stress made me overreact.",5,1732451364.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

From 1900 - 1909 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales

>Location Andreas, Isle of Man, England

>**Date: 1901** Time: daytime

>The young pre-teenage son of a local farming family named **John disappeared one day while out in the fields.** Villagers searched but found no trace of him, and the family suffered accordingly. **Then, out of the blue, four years after his disappearance, John wandered into the farmhouse, looking barely a day older, utterly disbelieving of the amount of time that his parents insisted had passed.** According to John‚Äô story, strange little men had rendered him senseless in the field. He next found himself in their ‚Äúland.‚Äù He could not explain where he now was except that the little men could show him the lives of his family. He was able to describe to family members some of the things they had been up to (including a trip to Ramsey corn market); **but while he was in captivity, all his attempts to communicate with them failed. He could observe but not directly interact, despite various almost ghost-like attempts to alert his family. John said he lost all sense of time** during this sojourn.

From The Healing Power of UFOs by Preston Dennett

>On the afternoon of July 12, 1975, four friends (Richard, Pat, Nancy and Ross), were having lunch in a crowded coffee bar in Dunedin, New Zealand. The weather was cold and damp, and all of them were suffering from various degrees of the flu. One of them suffered from a migraine headache. There were, they estimated, about eighty people sitting at various tables around them.

>**As they ate together, something very strange happened. Time stopped. Everyone around them became perfectly still and unmoving, however, the four friends could still move.** Richard was struck by the sight of unmoving steam above the espresso machine, and by the sight of a waitress frozen in place as she bent over an oven pulling out hotcakes.

>(SNIP)

>Staring around in shock, the four of them saw a strange figure appear at the top of the stairs on the opposite side of the room, which was the only public entrance and exit to the restaurant. He appeared to be a young man about six feet tall, slender, with black wavy hair, and olive skin. He was tastefully dressed in normal clothes and seemed to have a whitish aura of light glowing around him. They watched him float down the staircase, levitate across the room to the end of the line, where customers waited for their food.

>**The moment the man got into the line, time began to flow normally again. The four friends watched as the people around them moved normally without any indication or awareness that something strange had just happened.**

>Time: night

>12-year old Frank was watching television in his upstairs bedroom with his back to the double window. Suddenly he felt the strongest sensation of someone watching him from behind. When he turned around, he got the shock of his life. He saw standing on the roof of the house directly next door and to the left of his own‚Äîa gray alien peering from the opposite side of the roof at him through the double windows.

>(SNIP)

>his house and the house next door when he saw a gray up on top of the neighbor‚Äôs rooftop. When he noticed it‚Äîhe watched in awe and shock as **he noticed each one of his friends had been frozen in suspended animation**. Just then the witness saw the alien ‚Äúfloat like a feather‚Äù down towards the ground in front of him. At the very moment when it would have hit the ground, it simply disappeared in front of his eyes. **In looking at his friends he noticed that they were now unfrozen and went about their playing unaware that anything had ever occurred. None of his other friends saw this take place.**

From 1970 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales

>Location. Near Gil, Bahia Blanca, Argentina

>Date: September 20 1970

>Time: 0100A

>Traveling on an isolated road truck driver Osvaldo D‚ÄôAnuncio when after about 20 minutes of non-stop driving when something made him look up. He then saw a fiery white sphere of fire descending at high speed from the sky.

>(SNIP)

>In the place where the object had descended a burned circular area of grass about 10 meters in diameter was found. Also several telephone lines in the area were found severed and melted apparently along the object‚Äôs trajectory. **One last strange detail was that D‚ÄôAnuncio managed to drive a distance of 8km in only 2 minutes.**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

From the book ‚ÄúOur Haunted Planet"" by journalist John Keel

>A woman in Allentown, Pennsylvania, soberly related this strange story; she said she and her husband maintained a small summer cottage in the Pocono mountains, a mere thirty-minute drive from their home. One Saturday morning in July 1966, the young couple got into their car and started out for the cottage. **As they drove along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which seemed strangely devoid of traffic that day,** they saw a large circular object in the sky ahead of them.

>(SNIP)

>**In occult and UFO lore there are hundreds of reports of this phenomenon. It also seems to work in reverse. Witnesses claim that they drove or even walked incredible distances - sometimes hundreds of miles - in incredibly short periods of time. It is as if they crossed over into another dimension where time and space have a different relationship.**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

From the book ‚ÄúThe Custodians"" (about UFO abductions) by Delores Cannon

>Many investigators have explored cases of missing time, where several hours pass inexplicably without the person being aware of the lapse. I will discuss several later in this book. **But I have discovered a concept which I find even stranger: cases of condensed time. This is where the events take place in far less time than it would normally take.** Of course, both of these phenomena are examples of time being mysteriously distorted from the participant's point of view. We are hampered by being trapped within our concept of linear time. It has been said we may be the only planet in the universe that has invented a way to measure something that does not exist. **I have been told many times in my work that time is only an illusion, an invention of man. The aliens do not have this concept, and they have told me that man will never travel in space until he overcomes the erroneous idea of time.**

>(SNIP)

>A woman named Janet called him to relate a strange occurrence the night before in his area. The woman was very apprehensive and did not want to identify herself. **She told him she had traveled from Little Rock to her home, which was past the Conway area, in only fifteen minutes time. As it is a distance of approximately 50 miles, the trip normally took 45 minutes. There was no traffic on the four lane interstate highway the entire way, which was very unusual**

>(SNIP)

>I was certain she had checked the strange occurrence of condensed time, and she had. She seemed the type who wanted to verify every possible detail to satisfy her own curiosity. She had already double-checked with several people who verified the time she left a restaurant in Little Rock that evening. It was around midnight when she got on 1-40, and drove down the freeway until she came to the road that turned off to her home. **There is only one road in or out of that area, and there is always traffic no matter what time of the day or night**. She is very familiar with every twist and turn, and knows every house along the way, since she drives this route almost every day. **But that night everything seemed strange and different. There weren't any stars out, and she noticed it was extremely quiet. There was not even the sound of crickets. She distinctly noticed there were no lights in any of the houses, not even the outside mercury vapor lights which always burn. She knew this area very well, and there were always lights in the houses which could be seen for long distances. There was no sound and no sign of life. There was no traffic, which she considered to be very unusual.**

>Then she saw the object. It was huge, suspended just above the treetops ahead of her to her right. It was an enormous oblong shape, and glowing a very distinct bright orange color.

>(SNIP)

>When she entered the house she was surprised to see the time. She went through the house checking all the clocks against her watch, and they all said the same thing. **She had arrived home much too quickly. She estimated fifteen minutes, which would have been impossible, especially at the slow rate of speed she was traveling.**

>(SNIP)

>**I investigated another case that occurred in the city of Little Rock, as a woman was going to work on a busy highway during rush hour traffic. She saw a huge capsule-shaped craft suddenly appear directly in front of her in the sky. She thought it would cause most of the traffic to come to a screeching halt. Instead everything was proceeding normally. There were joggers running by on the sidewalk, and she frantically waved and shouted at them from her car. She tried to get their attention, and kept pointing upward. They continued jogging as though she was invisible.** She pulled her car over to the curb, and watched the craft do several drastic gyrations, and fly away. **No one else paid any attention to it, although it was huge.** She was not abducted, and nothing else happened during the event. I investigated a case in 1997 half a world away in England that was identical in all respects. Do these aliens have the ability to create an individual experience that no one else is allowed to witness?

>(SNIP)

>These incidents, however, seem to be a different type of experience from Janet's. **Eddie's world still had movement in it. Janet's did not. The world around her had stopped, while her private world continued. It was almost as though she was moving faster than the dimension she normally lived in. Everything in that world appeared to stop, because it was moving at a slower vibration.** Almost as though she was slipping and sliding through dimensions. The following case is another example.

>(SNIP)

>Frightened, Val put the car into reverse, turned around and headed toward the city. As she reached the highway the white glowing object moved and paced them on the passenger side of the car. It did not maintain any particular shape. It seemed to change, but remained a very white, luminous, glowing light. She drove faster, determined to reach the city as quickly as possible. **Then she noticed a strange phenomenon. There was no traffic in either lane, and no lights. (This sounded surprisingly similar to Janet's experience.) The unusual situation continued when she turned off the highway and entered the city. She then saw that the street lights were going out one by one as she approached them, and yet she could see to drive. Nothing was moving, neither the grass nor the trees. There was only an eerie silence. They saw no dogs, no cats, no other cars, no people, no lights in any of the houses. It was as if they were the only people in the world, a weird ""twilight zone"" feeling. She described it as being in a vacuum: no sound, no movement, nothing.** The street lights were off in the area they passed through, yet there was a soft radiating light coming from somewhere above them. They were determined to get someplace where there were other people. They went by a large shopping mall where there was an all-night restaurant. **The object then hovered over the mall. As they drove by the restaurant they noticed there was no sign of life, although it was open 24 hours a day. There were no lights and no people anywhere. As they drove on they did not meet any cars or see any people. Even though it was late normally there was always someone on the streets in the city.** Out of desperation they decided to go to a friend's office downtown. He often worked late at night, and they knew he would be there. **When they entered the office their world returned to normal.**

This new article dated 11-18-2024, mentions that scientists may have found a theoretical way to alter ""traditional time"" using quantum entanglement and vibrating magnets.

From [Time may be an illusion, new study finds - The Brighter Side of News](https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/time-may-be-an-illusion-new-study-finds/)

>Researchers propose that time is a result of quantum entanglement, the mysterious connection between particles separated by vast distances. Their findings, published in the journal Physical Review A, could offer a clue to solving the problem of time.

>(snip)

>To address this, the researchers revisited the Page and Wootters mechanism, a theory proposed in 1983. **It suggests that time emerges through quantum entanglement between one object and another acting as a clock. In an unentangled system, time does not exist,** and the universe appears frozen and unchanging.

>Applying this mechanism to two entangled but noninteracting theoretical quantum states‚Äî**a vibrating harmonic oscillator and a set of tiny magnets acting as a clock**‚Äîthe researchers found their system aligned perfectly with the Schr√∂dinger equation, which predicts the behavior of quantum objects. **Instead of traditional time, their version of the equation ran according to the states of the tiny magnets.**

>While this concept isn't entirely new, the team's next step was groundbreaking. They repeated their calculations, assuming first that the magnet clock and then the harmonic oscillator were macroscopic objects. The equations simplified into those used in classical physics, **suggesting that time's flow is a consequence of entanglement even on large scales.**",2,1732451284.0,UFOs_Archives,1,1.0,False

We are a young couple living in Turkey, and we decided to take a spontaneous trip to Japan. My wife works as a cabin crew member for Turkish Airlines, so we had the opportunity to fly to Tokyo with discounted tickets. Although we missed the cherry blossom season, Japan provided us with unforgettable memories.

We chose to stay at APA Hotels in Tokyo. The rooms are small but functional, and the location, close to the metro, was really convenient. When planning your trip, be sure to consider the metro line. Hotel check-in and check-out can be done at machines, which is a huge convenience.

The regions of Kamakura and Yokohama outside of Tokyo offer a more peaceful but equally impressive side of Japan. Kamakura's historic temples and the giant Buddha statue will captivate you, while Yokohama's modern harbor area and entertainment spots will surprise you.

Japan is a shopping paradise for those who love to shop.¬†*Yodobashi Akiba*¬†and¬†*Big Camera*¬†are must-visit spots for electronics and other products. Don't leave without picking up cosmetics from brands like¬†*Shiseido*; their skincare products are truly amazing! While shopping during the trip, I used a very handy tool where you can enter the price of your product (for example, 98,000 yen) into the input field, and it automatically calculates the tax-free discount and converts the price into Turkish lira. It was a real time-saver and helped me manage my budget efficiently. Plus, if you leave your shopping for the last days of your trip, you‚Äôll avoid carrying too much luggage.

In Harajuku, we visited¬†*Owl Village*¬†and spent time with owls, which was an amazing experience. Be sure to make a reservation in advance! Also, I recommend spending one morning at¬†*Starbucks Reserve*¬†for breakfast. They have delicious food, and the place is almost like a museum. You can enjoy coffee and take amazing photos as well.

One afternoon, definitely try a¬†*Eggslut*¬†egg sandwich ‚Äì it was absolutely delicious. Japanese cuisine is unique, and you‚Äôll never get enough of sushi, ramen, and tempura.

We also had a fun experience in Japan‚Äôs arcades, where we won 3 anime girl figures! We spent about 4000 yen, but it was so much fun. Also, when leaving the airport, don‚Äôt forget to buy¬†*Bitter Nama Chocolate*¬†as a gift for yourself and your loved ones. Its creamy chocolate melts in your mouth and creates an amazing burst of flavor.

I highly recommend¬†*&Honey*¬†shampoo and hair conditioners. They are truly fantastic, and even baby hairs started growing for me!

Japan is an enchanting country in every way. As a tourist-friendly destination, it makes you feel special with its warm-hearted people, organized lifestyle, and security. We never had any negative experiences; everything is extremely organized and transparent. The Japanese treat tourists with respect, and you never feel like you've been overcharged.

>Time: 0100A

>Traveling on an isolated road truck driver Osvaldo D‚ÄôAnuncio when after about 20 minutes of non-stop driving when something made him look up. He then saw a fiery white sphere of fire descending at high speed from the sky.

>(SNIP)

>In the place where the object had descended a burned circular area of grass about 10 meters in diameter was found. Also several telephone lines in the area were found severed and melted apparently along the object‚Äôs trajectory. **One last strange detail was that D‚ÄôAnuncio managed to drive a distance of 8km in only 2 minutes.**

From the book ‚ÄúOur Haunted Planet"" by journalist John Keel

>A woman in Allentown, Pennsylvania, soberly related this strange story; she said she and her husband maintained a small summer cottage in the Pocono mountains, a mere thirty-minute drive from their home. One Saturday morning in July 1966, the young couple got into their car and started out for the cottage. **As they drove along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which seemed strangely devoid of traffic that day,** they saw a large circular object in the sky ahead of them.

>(SNIP)

>**In occult and UFO lore there are hundreds of reports of this phenomenon. It also seems to work in reverse. Witnesses claim that they drove or even walked incredible distances - sometimes hundreds of miles - in incredibly short periods of time. It is as if they crossed over into another dimension where time and space have a different relationship.**

From the book ‚ÄúThe Custodians"" (about UFO abductions) by Delores Cannon

>Many investigators have explored cases of missing time, where several hours pass inexplicably without the person being aware of the lapse. I will discuss several later in this book. **But I have discovered a concept which I find even stranger: cases of condensed time. This is where the events take place in far less time than it would normally take.** Of course, both of these phenomena are examples of time being mysteriously distorted from the participant's point of view. We are hampered by being trapped within our concept of linear time. It has been said we may be the only planet in the universe that has invented a way to measure something that does not exist. **I have been told many times in my work that time is only an illusion, an invention of man. The aliens do not have this concept, and they have told me that man will never travel in space until he overcomes the erroneous idea of time.**

>(SNIP)

>A woman named Janet called him to relate a strange occurrence the night before in his area. The woman was very apprehensive and did not want to identify herself. **She told him she had traveled from Little Rock to her home, which was past the Conway area, in only fifteen minutes time. As it is a distance of approximately 50 miles, the trip normally took 45 minutes. There was no traffic on the four lane interstate highway the entire way, which was very unusual**

>(SNIP)

>I was certain she had checked the strange occurrence of condensed time, and she had. She seemed the type who wanted to verify every possible detail to satisfy her own curiosity. She had already double-checked with several people who verified the time she left a restaurant in Little Rock that evening. It was around midnight when she got on 1-40, and drove down the freeway until she came to the road that turned off to her home. **There is only one road in or out of that area, and there is always traffic no matter what time of the day or night**. She is very familiar with every twist and turn, and knows every house along the way, since she drives this route almost every day. **But that night everything seemed strange and different. There weren't any stars out, and she noticed it was extremely quiet. There was not even the sound of crickets. She distinctly noticed there were no lights in any of the houses, not even the outside mercury vapor lights which always burn. She knew this area very well, and there were always lights in the houses which could be seen for long distances. There was no sound and no sign of life. There was no traffic, which she considered to be very unusual.**

>Then she saw the object. It was huge, suspended just above the treetops ahead of her to her right. It was an enormous oblong shape, and glowing a very distinct bright orange color.

>(SNIP)

>When she entered the house she was surprised to see the time. She went through the house checking all the clocks against her watch, and they all said the same thing. **She had arrived home much too quickly. She estimated fifteen minutes, which would have been impossible, especially at the slow rate of speed she was traveling.**

>(SNIP)

>**I investigated another case that occurred in the city of Little Rock, as a woman was going to work on a busy highway during rush hour traffic. She saw a huge capsule-shaped craft suddenly appear directly in front of her in the sky. She thought it would cause most of the traffic to come to a screeching halt. Instead everything was proceeding normally. There were joggers running by on the sidewalk, and she frantically waved and shouted at them from her car. She tried to get their attention, and kept pointing upward. They continued jogging as though she was invisible.** She pulled her car over to the curb, and watched the craft do several drastic gyrations, and fly away. **No one else paid any attention to it, although it was huge.** She was not abducted, and nothing else happened during the event. I investigated a case in 1997 half a world away in England that was identical in all respects. Do these aliens have the ability to create an individual experience that no one else is allowed to witness?

>(SNIP)

>These incidents, however, seem to be a different type of experience from Janet's. **Eddie's world still had movement in it. Janet's did not. The world around her had stopped, while her private world continued. It was almost as though she was moving faster than the dimension she normally lived in. Everything in that world appeared to stop, because it was moving at a slower vibration.** Almost as though she was slipping and sliding through dimensions. The following case is another example.

>(SNIP)

>Frightened, Val put the car into reverse, turned around and headed toward the city. As she reached the highway the white glowing object moved and paced them on the passenger side of the car. It did not maintain any particular shape. It seemed to change, but remained a very white, luminous, glowing light. She drove faster, determined to reach the city as quickly as possible. **Then she noticed a strange phenomenon. There was no traffic in either lane, and no lights. (This sounded surprisingly similar to Janet's experience.) The unusual situation continued when she turned off the highway and entered the city. She then saw that the street lights were going out one by one as she approached them, and yet she could see to drive. Nothing was moving, neither the grass nor the trees. There was only an eerie silence. They saw no dogs, no cats, no other cars, no people, no lights in any of the houses. It was as if they were the only people in the world, a weird ""twilight zone"" feeling. She described it as being in a vacuum: no sound, no movement, nothing.** The street lights were off in the area they passed through, yet there was a soft radiating light coming from somewhere above them. They were determined to get someplace where there were other people. They went by a large shopping mall where there was an all-night restaurant. **The object then hovered over the mall. As they drove by the restaurant they noticed there was no sign of life, although it was open 24 hours a day. There were no lights and no people anywhere. As they drove on they did not meet any cars or see any people. Even though it was late normally there was always someone on the streets in the city.** Out of desperation they decided to go to a friend's office downtown. He often worked late at night, and they knew he would be there. **When they entered the office their world returned to normal.**

This new article dated 11-18-2024, mentions that scientists may have found a theoretical way to alter ""traditional time"" using quantum entanglement and vibrating magnets.

From[ Time may be an illusion, new study finds - The Brighter Side of News](https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/time-may-be-an-illusion-new-study-finds/)

>Researchers propose that time is a result of quantum entanglement, the mysterious connection between particles separated by vast distances. Their findings, published in the journal Physical Review A, could offer a clue to solving the problem of time.

>(snip)

>To address this, the researchers revisited the Page and Wootters mechanism, a theory proposed in 1983. **It suggests that time emerges through quantum entanglement between one object and another acting as a clock. In an unentangled system, time does not exist,** and the universe appears frozen and unchanging.

>Applying this mechanism to two entangled but noninteracting theoretical quantum states‚Äî**a vibrating harmonic oscillator and a set of tiny magnets acting as a clock**‚Äîthe researchers found their system aligned perfectly with the Schr√∂dinger equation, which predicts the behavior of quantum objects. **Instead of traditional time, their version of the equation ran according to the states of the tiny magnets.**

>While this concept isn't entirely new, the team's next step was groundbreaking. They repeated their calculations, assuming first that the magnet clock and then the harmonic oscillator were macroscopic objects. The equations simplified into those used in classical physics, **suggesting that time's flow is a consequence of entanglement even on large scales.**",8,1732451038.0,aliens,4,0.83,False

UFOs also seem to have the ability to temporarily move people out of our reality's normal time stream. Placing the victim either into a ""ghost world"" where everything looks the same as the normal environment, except there are no other humans around, or alternately, making the victim invisible to other humans and unable to interact with them. UFO researchers call these ""The Oz Factor"" (See examples below). The science article near the bottom of this post, might provide a clue to how this is done.

>Location Andreas, Isle of Man, England

>**Date: 1901** Time: daytime

>The young pre-teenage son of a local farming family named **John disappeared one day while out in the fields.** Villagers searched but found no trace of him, and the family suffered accordingly. **Then, out of the blue, four years after his disappearance, John wandered into the farmhouse, looking barely a day older, utterly disbelieving of the amount of time that his parents insisted had passed.** According to John‚Äô story, strange little men had rendered him senseless in the field. He next found himself in their ‚Äúland.‚Äù He could not explain where he now was except that the little men could show him the lives of his family. He was able to describe to family members some of the things they had been up to (including a trip to Ramsey corn market); **but while he was in captivity, all his attempts to communicate with them failed. He could observe but not directly interact, despite various almost ghost-like attempts to alert his family. John said he lost all sense of time** during this sojourn.

From The Healing Power of UFOs by Preston Dennett

>On the afternoon of July 12, 1975, four friends (Richard, Pat, Nancy and Ross), were having lunch in a crowded coffee bar in Dunedin, New Zealand. The weather was cold and damp, and all of them were suffering from various degrees of the flu. One of them suffered from a migraine headache. There were, they estimated, about eighty people sitting at various tables around them.

>**As they ate together, something very strange happened. Time stopped. Everyone around them became perfectly still and unmoving, however, the four friends could still move.** Richard was struck by the sight of unmoving steam above the espresso machine, and by the sight of a waitress frozen in place as she bent over an oven pulling out hotcakes.

>(SNIP)

>Staring around in shock, the four of them saw a strange figure appear at the top of the stairs on the opposite side of the room, which was the only public entrance and exit to the restaurant. He appeared to be a young man about six feet tall, slender, with black wavy hair, and olive skin. He was tastefully dressed in normal clothes and seemed to have a whitish aura of light glowing around him. They watched him float down the staircase, levitate across the room to the end of the line, where customers waited for their food.

>**The moment the man got into the line, time began to flow normally again. The four friends watched as the people around them moved normally without any indication or awareness that something strange had just happened.**

I tried dating. Tried to build more of my life. Haven't achieved much, in fact I had the biggest losses in my lifetime and one big win due to emotional turmoil. During the breakup the other person made me feel like I'm not good enough. I convinced myself I'm good enough since I started dating the day after, but reality hit me like a truck when I had no romantic nor sexual success even after a year. I feel like I don't have anyone to support me in my mental and physical struggles.

I suppose I'm to blame since I didn't want to listen to the usual advice on breakups and past relationships. I wanted to do things my way. Didn't go no-contact at first, tried to stay as friends, hooked up once with them, went to a few 1-on-1 coffees with them, and didn't stop the conversation when troubles from our past relationship came into the topic. Ultimately had a big argument that made me distrust my friends. We both decided to go no-contact for a while. I even still view their public profile and the reality of dating and not being good enough of a partner hit me again. I don't feel good enough compared to other people of my sex.

But the contact never came back. She had a few partners in the meantime, I had none. My ego hurts, and I know I became less attractive in the meantime and didn't develop as a person. In a way I'm worse. 

I think it's in part that despite it being a long-term relationship we rarely managed to be together physically. Life and career got in the way, along with personal mistakes. I felt there was something deep in them that I can connect with... but it felt like they were scared of ever showing their true nature. They felt like they weren't good enough in ways I couldn't care less about, and sabotaged things I did care about. But in rare cases when they opened up completely, without worrying... things were soo great. I wanted more of that and I doubt I can meet someone like that.

It feels so painful to not be a part of life of someone you still love. Even if it was an unhealthy love.

But I‚Äôve realized these ratings are killing my travel experience. There‚Äôs a decent bar for coffee and sandwiches, but a 3.9 rating makes me skip it. A 4.2? Well, there‚Äôs a 4.3 restaurant across the street, so I‚Äôd rather go there. But if you dig into the reviews, you‚Äôll often find complaints about things like the staff not speaking English, which isn‚Äôt really a big deal for me (I just got back from Spain and I speak Spanish).

Another issue with these ratings is that they kill any desire to explore. I‚Äôm unlikely to step into a simple local coffee shop with old chairs if some tourist gave it a 1-star review because they didn‚Äôt serve caramel iced frappuccino lattes or speak English (what could ruined the overall rating of the place).

I guess I'm asking is there proof? Has someone had someone write a note and put it upside down on a table in the other room and you go over and read it? Have two astral projectors had the intention of meeting in the same spot and speaking? If it's real why wouldn't that be a common goal to meet other projectors.

Very interested to hear comments on this. Coffee in hand, prove me wrong. ",5,1732450472.0,AstralProjection,11,0.78,False

I feel like she often manipulates my emotions for power and uses my vulnerabilities later to hurt me. Also I feel like she tried to sabotage my past relationship (1.5 years) for whatever reason, even if just a little. Tried to convince me how my ex isn't fair to me and stuff like that, even when it made no sense. This isn't about breakups though, but talking about emotions with my mum. Recently my mum was in the city for medical reasons and the two of us had a coffee for a few hours. It went OK, and now I feel softer towards her even if usually I rarely talk with her.

TL;DR I have trust issues with my mum, but recently got softer towards her. I feel the need to call her and talk about my issues. Should I do it?",1,1732450364.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

Finally, and this one is my best CRIMEZ to date. After Mama did all her cat related chores this morning, she sat in William‚Äôs fabrit armchair wiff a cup ob coffee. I came to sit next to her on arm ob chair. We gaze out ob window and Mama sai things liek, ‚ÄúGosh, Rubie. This *wind*. The gales are really strong. Thanks Dog teh fence is strong. Naow look, it raining too‚Ä¶‚Äù This Mama‚Äôs fabrit tiems ob dae so I humour her babbling butt I decide to gibs myself a pawdicure and I BITEBITEBITE mine nails. And then‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶I bite nail and it flies off and lands right in Mama‚Äôs coffee! Frens, it was GLOARIOUS. I begin to see why teh lief ob CRIMEZ is so appealing.

Your Fren, Ruben T Void

1gyplg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1gyplg2/it_feel_surreal_that_its_done/,It Feel Surreal That It‚Äôs Done,"I had my hysterectomy on Tuesday (11/19). So 4dpo-ish? Robotic Assisted. Everything but the ovaries. I had it done because I have multiple autoimmune issues and the problems that come along with that AND unfortunately living in a red state (blue city). My periods were never ‚Äúbad‚Äù but becoming a tad bit irregular (for my liking). My hormone levels were normal and nothing out of the ordinary on the ultrasound. (I‚Äôll list my conditions toward the end for those curious).

I was losing 3 weeks of my life every month. My energy and body would crash the week before, the week of, and I would be recovering the week after. And by the time I was feeling vaguely like myself, it was coming around again. Like, I already have so few ‚Äúgood‚Äù days, I was done also planning around my period.
But also, I needed permanent BC.

I realize I may still experience some of that as I kept my ovaries since I‚Äôm in my 30s. But it will still have to be better than what I was already living with.

I will say mine was simple, straightforward, with no complications (no endo, fibroids, cysts, etc.) But for anyone curious for experiences here‚Äôs how mine went and is going:

I did take about 4 hours, some walking, 3 bags of fluids, 2 apple juices and a bottle of water to finally be able to urinate post-op. So don‚Äôt try and rush it too much. I‚Äôm also chronically dehydrated on a good day, so that doesn‚Äôt help me, lol.

If you have long hair and you‚Äôre able to get your hair up into a couple of braids before surgery (like French braids or whatever works for you) it can keep your hair out of the way for a good while.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for more anti-emetic in recovery if you need to (like zofran). 

I also hope everyone gets a bair hugger heated hospital gown. That thing was amazing!!! 

I was expecting the gas to be the worst thing, but it was actually my throat that was the most painful thing for 2 days. Like, I knew my throat would hurt, just wasn‚Äôt expecting it to get as bad as it did. Ultimately, Gas-x was a waste for me. 

I started a non-stimulant stool softener the morning after surgery and have taken one every morning. I didn‚Äôt have a movement until Saturday morning with the help of hydration, juice and coffee. 
As my doctor said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to have to put in some effort. But also don‚Äôt force it, especially if constipated.‚Äù
I would also not try to rush this, as it wasn‚Äôt until Saturday that I was comfortable even to be ABLE to reach around. I‚Äôll definitely continue taking the softeners while I‚Äôm on the pain meds. I am also glad I did not feel anything move over my cuff.

Protein shake, lunchables, and small easy things  like the muffins or frittatas from ‚ÄòVeggies are Great‚Äô have been a life saver.

As someone who does not like straight prune juice, I did find an apple prune juice combo by Gerber. Technically for toddlers and only in little 4oz bottles. So you may need 2 at a time, but it‚Äôs worth it. Getting 2 separate juices to mix seemed like a waste for the amount of time I‚Äôll need it.

I did get Always Discreet postpartum disposable underwear. Even though I haven‚Äôt been bleeding aside from the spotting that first day, it offers peace of mind and one less laundry item. 

Walking around feels good, but there is a fine line before ‚Äúover doing it‚Äù hits me.

Lounging at an angle is better than sitting. Sleeping on an incline with the help of pillows has been helpful.

I regret not attempting to do tricep dips or squats a months prior to surgery. You‚Äôll need those muscles in place of your abs.

The 3 hour alternating pain meds that my doctor put me on have been great, but I feel stiff all over if I oversleep a dose. Alternating tramadol and extra strength Tylenol every 3 hours so they‚Äôre both taken every 6 hours.

I also personally have not felt any of my insides shift to fill the space either.

Claritin (or Zyrtec) with Benadryl cream for medical adhesive allergies. (I am not putting the cream on the sutures but around the edges of the large bandage coverings.)

Overall though, even through the pain meds, everything at this point, I just feel really sore like I did an intense workout for the first time in forever, including my vagina. It isn‚Äôt bad, but still nervous to come off the meds. (I am a big baby lol)

I‚Äôm also super thankful for my doctor. She said it wasn‚Äôt her first choice for permanent BC because of the risk of prolapses, but admitted that salpingectomy(sp? plus pain meds) or ligation could make periods worse, and a failed ablation could ultimately lead to a hysterectomy anyway. She didn‚Äôt care that I didn‚Äôt have kids and she didn‚Äôt need the approval of my spouse either. 
So we proceeded, I went in there expecting more resistance than I got, but I think she saw how set I was, and agreed.
It really should be that simple for everyone, and it makes me smad that it isn‚Äôt. 

If anyone is also curious as to the various conditions that led me to this decision I have no issues discussing/disclosing that either. I have:
* HS (groin flares and periods are not fun, also hormonal BC options flared my HS, and my Rheumatologist did not want me on hormonal BC either).
* Autoimmune Hypothyroidism 
* IgA Nephropathy 
* Sj√∂gren‚Äôs 

It‚Äôs hard to tell what caused what, or what came first but because of these I also have secondary conditions like: osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and arthritis.

Not a sympathy grab, but rather if someone is debating yeeting their uterus due to autoimmune conditions or other health issues but has a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù reproductive system, I‚Äôm happy to provide my background and experience.

Ultimately, only time will tell if it was worth it. But I have a good feeling.",5,1732450256.0,hysterectomy,3,0.86,False
