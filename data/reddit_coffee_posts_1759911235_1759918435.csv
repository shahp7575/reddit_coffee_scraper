Titan Mining shares rose after it said the U.S.'s export credit agency is considering a $120 million loan to support the development of its graphite mine in New York state.

**Shares rose 8.3% to 2.35 Canadian dollars ($1.69)**

**The Export-Import Bank of the U.S. has expressed financing interest under its ""Make More in America"" initiative for the construction of the Kilbourne Graphite Project in St. Lawrence County.**

The Toronto-listed U.S.-based miner's main production is zinc, but the company also is advancing the Kilbourne Graphite Project, located near its existing mill.

Graphite, like zinc, is considered a critical metal due to its role in industry, technology and national security. It is the primary material used in lithium-ion battery anodes, making it essential for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, as well as in nuclear reactors, lubricants and high-temperature industrial applications.

As things stand, the U.S. relies heavily on imports, particularly from China, which raises concerns about supply-chain vulnerability and the need for domestic production and processing capabilities.

As of now, the letter of interest to Titan by EXIM recognizes the Kilbourne Project as a strategic U.S. critical-minerals asset aligned with national priorities, but doesn't represent a binding commitment of any kind.

**The credit agency, which is the official export credit agency of the U.S. government, said it would consider recommending a direct loan of up to $120 million, which Titan said would cover most of the capital needs to develop the project.**

Titan said it will continue to work to advance its due diligence and structure a definitive financing package for the Kilbourne Project in the coming months.

(Reuters) -The Trump administration is ramping up its efforts to secure U.S. supply chains for critical minerals and semiconductors by converting federal grants into equity stakes in key companies.

The move marks a shift from traditional subsidies to direct ownership, aimed at reducing reliance on China for materials vital to electric vehicles, defense systems and advanced computing.

The administration has taken or discussed stakes in several companies across the mining and tech sectors, signalling a more aggressive industrial policy.

**Following are the companies linked to the Trump administration's strategic investment push:**

**\*\* Critical Metals**

Stake under discussion: About 8%

Project: Tanbreez rare earths deposit, Greenland

Strategic value: Trump administration officials have discussed taking a stake in Critical Metals, four people familiar with the discussions told Reuters, which would give Washington a direct interest in the largest rare earths project in Greenland, the Arctic territory that President Donald Trump once suggested buying.

**\*\* Lithium Americas**

Stake acquired: 5% in parent company and 5% in Thacker Pass JV with General Motors

Project: Thacker Pass lithium mine, Nevada

Strategic value: The Thacker Pass project is seen as a linchpin in building a domestic supply chain part of Washington's long-standing drive to boost U.S. production of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics.

  
**\*\* MP Materials**

Stake acquired: About 15%

Project: Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California

Strategic value: MP operates the only U.S. rare earths mine and is working to boost domestic processing and magnet production. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) will become the largest shareholder in Las Vegas-based MP, making it Washington's most high-profile investment to date in the critical minerals sector.

**\*\* USA Rare Earth**

Status: In discussions

Details: Barbara Humpton, CEO of the company, told CNBC that it was in close talks with the White House while responding to a question about its potential interest in striking a deal with the Trump administration.

Strategic value: USA Rare Earth has been developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas and a neo magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, which is expected to go commercial in the first half of 2026

**\*\* Intel Corp**

Stake acquired: 9.9%

Strategic value: The investment strengthens U.S. supply chain security and supports Intel's plans to build and expand advanced manufacturing facilities domestically.

**& Yesterday's Announcement of-**  
**Trilogy Metals**

* The White House announced plans to[¬†take a 10% stake in Trilogy Metals](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/10/48058066/trilogy-metals-stock-soars-after-us-government-announces-10-stake)¬†through a $35.6 million investment to support mining exploration in Alaska‚Äôs Ambler Mining District.

* The investment includes warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company. The move is designed to unlock access to one of the world‚Äôs largest undeveloped copper-zinc mineral belts.

# ‚úÖ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple¬†**Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and¬†**future recycling**
* Alignment with the¬†**MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**,¬†**DoD offtakes**,¬†**EXIM funding**, and the¬†new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**U.S. National Security Asset**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek‚Äôs mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# üîë The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)**¬†‚Äì¬†**The**¬†***quiet giant***\*\*!\*\*! From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler.¬†**Elk Creek could supply a good portion ‚Äî potentially all ‚Äî of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.**
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl‚ÇÑ)**¬†‚Äì Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl‚ÇÑ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)**¬†‚Äì¬†*The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)**¬†‚Äì The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships.¬†*Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ‚ö° Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance**¬†‚Üí Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition**¬†‚Üí Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts**¬†‚Üí 2025 drilling added¬†**9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)**¬†plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October¬†could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:**¬†Pentagon‚Äôs $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium‚Äôs defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:**¬†$110M‚Äî funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:**¬†Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms.¬†**(Lithium Americas latest!)**
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:**¬†**TODAY'S J.P. MORGAN EVENT in D.C., October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.**
* **Strategic Convergence:**¬†Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs ‚Äî Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

I delight in spotting uselessness
and cannot stop spreading others‚Äô flaws.
You ask why I do what helps no one;
because it helps no one, it has value.

The moon slipped behind clouds and disappeared.
When I was young I knew no limits,
wore the air of change and flaunted it.
I spent nights in a bar with naked women, looked down on a man dead in the street;
beside him the weeds were moving.

A little kid came up and asked,
‚ÄúIs this person okay?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat is what your father ends up as,‚Äù I said, and made the child cry,
and inside I heard something begin to fill.

What do people do, and what do they burn for.
There was a man who said he would stake everything on a hamburger set meal.
Takeout available, rice, vegetables, onion soup, and the patty;
fried egg or demi‚Äëglace or cheese chosen freely by the guest.
For margin‚Äôs sake he used cheap meat and multiplied toppings, and failed gloriously,
fell into heavy debt, and now can‚Äôt make a living.

He says, ‚ÄúThe rent was too high; I should have gone farther out,‚Äù
but the meat is bad, the sauce too strong, the toppings cold; one try and you‚Äôre done.
I for one cannot face a hamburger at noon.

I carried this tale around,
bought small laughs, and people left me little by little.
My sense of safety did not shrink,
but that never fills the core.
Knowing it, my mouth went on.

I told myself to look inward and build a better life from regret,
and kept crushing, one by one, the little grains of conscience that rose from deep inside.

One day I fell in love at first sight.
Sloping shoulders, an egg‚Äëshaped face, a sharp single eyelid,
brown short hair, a silver necklace,
twill trousers worn loose and wide,
a white linen shirt and a camisole,
sneakers smudged a little.
I did my usual walk.
I had been the center of talk,
bought others‚Äô laughter again and again, killed my conscience, played the clown, and grew used to it.

Besides the man who lost his life on a hamburger set, I mimicked a man so overweight his fat crushed his throat and speech,
trying hard to warm the room.
We drank coffee; she smiled at times and listened to me in silence.

Toward evening she said,
‚ÄúThe coffee here tastes off. As if it mocks us in some vague way, doesn‚Äôt it,‚Äù
and while she filed a complaint with the shop the chair stayed empty; the messages never came; we both knew what had happened.
Even so I still cannot forget her; about once a week I remember, mix myself into others‚Äô misfortune, and steady myself watching their thin laughter somewhere.

---

Explanation Poem 

There are nights I can breathe only by choosing what helps no one.
The showiness of youth glows with the thinness of a clouded moon.
Weeds move beside the dead; a child‚Äôs question stays in the chest.
The comfort bought with laughter never reaches the core.
One man staked it on a plate, lost flavor to margin, multiplied cold choices, and sank.
Cheap meat, heavy sauce, a lateness called boredom.
My telling does not stop; grains of conscience crush under the fingers.
Clothing details pull memory close; the clown‚Äôs gait becomes a habit.
‚ÄúUnpleasant,‚Äù she says of the coffee, and the chair stays empty.
Absence needs no gloss; silence arrives first.
At noon my stomach refuses the hamburger; only the thinness of laughter gathers.
Messages recede; safety does not shrink; the core will not fill.
I mix myself into others‚Äô misfortune and steady down in a room without warmth.
Still, once a week I remember,
and reach for the place where I failed to choose a taste.
At the rim of the plate, laughter cools.

The Concept:
We're building a network of EV charging hubs along major highways. The goal is to completely transform the charging experience. Instead of a couple of lonely chargers in a dimly lit corner of a car park, we're creating full-service destinations.
Think of it as a roadside oasis for the modern traveler. You pull in to charge your EV, and in the 20-40 minutes it takes, you can enjoy:
Ultra-Fast Charging: The latest, most reliable DC fast-chargers for all types of EVs.
A Premium Food Hub: Great coffee, fresh meals, and healthy grab-and-go options. Not your typical gas station food.
Top-Tier Amenities: Clean, modern restrooms, a comfortable lounge with high-speed Wi-Fi, and a safe, welcoming environment.
The Vibe We're Going For:
We need a name that sounds modern, reliable, efficient, and welcoming. It should communicate speed and technology, but also comfort and hospitality.
Some keywords and concepts we've been thinking about:
Tech/Power words: Volt, Amp, Charge, Circuit, Node, Power, Spark, Joule, Flow
Travel/Rest words: Oasis, Hub, Rest, Waypoint, Journey, Stop, Haven, Relay
Green/Eco words: Eco, Leaf, Green, Terra, Earth, Current
I'm open to anything‚Äîfrom cool, techy names to clever puns to something that just sounds classic and trustworthy.

Possible money laundering a-go-go.","I have raised the issue of the interloper cafe Toast before (down at The Shore), due to weird & bad stories about them. 

I am starting to think it is a money laundering front. Toast has only been open at the Shore for around under two years. But yet it is now opened a second cafe on Leith Walk. It takes around three - four years for a cafe to turn a profit. Bam Cafe on Salamander Street was selling good stuff, had footfall, and yet closed after two years trading. **And it was better than Toast ever will be**. Bam Cafe didn't turn a profit.

I've been browsing online trying to get inspiration but there are SO many options, and it's overwhelming. I checked Zara and H&M but everything looks the same. I looked on Amazon and found some cute stuff but reviews say sizing is all over the place. I even stumbled on Alibaba which had sexy clothes for women at decent prices but I'm worried about quality.

1o166hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1o166hs/being_bullied_by_shift_supervisor_is_this_message/,"Being bullied by shift supervisor, is this message to my manager sufficient to address the issue?","For a quick background, I work at a cafe where there‚Äôs a shift supervisor who has previously clashed with others and been accused of bullying in the past. When I started a year ago, I was part time whilst studying, she often spoke poorly to me, but I was new so just brushed it off and tried to get up to speed. A year later, I think I‚Äôm proficient in every aspect of the job, and I‚Äôve since upped my contract by a couple of shifts per week, and I‚Äôm finding myself working with her more, where her attitude and behaviour has reverted towards me (I‚Äôm a guy so maybe she feels she can get away with rough banter towards me). 
For context, just a couple of the incidents in the past week I‚Äôve had with her that have got me to this point of not just wanting to just ignore her attitude:

‚Ä¢ She was helping a new girl on the till while I was assigned on drive thru drinks, and even though I was on track and all caught up, she was always making digs at me about my speed or drink quality, giving me confusing or wrong info, or micromanaging and moving things around etc when it wasn‚Äôt needed. As I say, I was all caught up and the queue was moving so I think it was unnecessary. I‚Äôm happy to take criticism, help, or advice but I just felt the way she was acting was like to purposefully to throw me off.
I tried saying to her that I was going as fast as I can, or that insulting me was just throwing me off, but didn‚Äôt make a difference.
After the queue ended, she referred to me as ‚Äúthis little shit‚Ä¶‚Äù in front of the new girl who I‚Äôd just met.

‚Ä¢ When it got to 3:30, I was cleaning the coffee machine (it was extra messy as one of the coffee handles had exploded a load of coffee everywhere while the shot was pulling), and again, even though I got the drive thru bar all cleaned and stocked by 5pm, she just spent the whole time saying things like ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre still cleaning?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just do your job for you then‚Äù ‚Äúyou really don‚Äôt remember anything do you?‚Äù or patronising comments.
It ended with with her sitting on the floor next to me and she continued, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired of being nice today, I want to be nasty‚Äù, meanwhile I‚Äôm cleaning asap while she sits there üòÇ me and the other closer got everything done in plenty of time that day so I don‚Äôt know where it was coming from, it just came across that she was solely trying to wind me up and antagonise me.

Here is the potential message I was planning to send my manager, who I get on with really well and has always been helpful and is well aware of this supervisor‚Äôs clashes, but this supervisor works a lot, and covers absences a lot, which is why is suspect she hasn‚Äôt be reprimanded/fired. This manager has also explicitly said we need to try and work out our differences personally before coming to her, which I feel I‚Äôve done when replying to (supervisor) in the moment, but I‚Äôm an introverted, none-confrontational person, and would probably end up rather emotional if I had to pull her aside and have an argument face to face, as my mental health is quite poor atm:

‚ÄúHey (manager), sorry to be bothering you with this, I know you‚Äôve got a load on your plate. I was just wondering if at all possible if I‚Äôm doing a close that I could be assigned with any supervisor but (redacted)? I always felt like she micromanaged unnecessarily a lot of the time which I can brush off, and I‚Äôll spare you the details but lately I feel like she‚Äôs like targeting me to purposefully wind me up or goad me with insults. I‚Äôve tried to tell her that I‚Äôm doing my best or that she‚Äôs just putting me off but it doesn‚Äôt seem to make a difference.
I know there‚Äôs always going to be people we don‚Äôt get on with, but I feel I‚Äôm getting a lot better/efficient on closes with some of the other supervisors and learning a lot, however I understand it might not always be possible, but just thought I‚Äôd mention it as I‚Äôm not in the best headspace atm and don‚Äôt fancy getting into an argument with her‚Äù

p.s. for context, my dad is currently going through chemotherapy and my dog has just died which is why I‚Äôm not in a good headspace rn.

Any advice would be appreciated, ty

Welcome to the future of crypto payments‚Äîwhere QR codes meet Bitcoin, and magic happens (well, code + convenience). If you‚Äôve ever typed out a 34-character Bitcoin address only to realize you made a typo, you‚Äôll love what we‚Äôre about to unveil: our **free Bitcoin QR code API**. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs frictionless, and it‚Äôs ready to turn your Bitcoin address into a scannable masterpiece.

# Why a Bitcoin QR code, anyway?

Imagine your coffee shop can accept Bitcoin. Instead of handing someone a long string like `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa` and crossing your fingers, you display a QR code. They just scan ‚Äî money goes zoom ‚Äî and you didn‚Äôt break a sweat. That‚Äôs the power of the Bitcoin QR code: fast, error-free, and delightfully modern.

Plus, QR codes are everywhere now‚Äîrestaurants, flyers, business cards‚Äîand converting Bitcoin addresses to QR codes is a no-brainer for speed and accuracy. ([BitcoinWiki](https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/qr-code-generator?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# What makes our API so rad?

1. **Totally Free** ‚Äì No hidden fees, no subscription required.
2. **Zero setup fuss** ‚Äì Just embed an image tag with our URL; presto, QR code appears.
3. **Crypto-friendly** ‚Äì The API supports the Bitcoin URI scheme, so wallets can interpret the payment request with address (and optionally, amount).
4. **Brand safe** ‚Äì You can use crypto logos (within reason) so the QR still looks legit without breaking its readability.
5. **Privacy-minded** ‚Äì We don‚Äôt log your address scans or keep cookies around.

You can see the full details (and grab your API endpoint) right here:  
[https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/)

# How to use it (in five fun steps)

1. Pick your public Bitcoin address.
2. Grab the API URL (e.g. `https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/api/?style=bitcoin&address=YOUR_ADDRESS`).
3. Embed it as an `<img>` in your site or app:<img src=""https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/api/?style=bitcoin&address=1YourBTCAddressHere"" alt=""Scan to send Bitcoin"" /> 
4. Optionally layer in amount, style tweaks, or size.
5. Let people scan, send BTC, and marvel at how futuristic you are.

It‚Äôs that simple. ([Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Real-world perks & use cases

* **Merchants & shops** can add a ‚ÄúPay with Bitcoin‚Äù QR graphic at checkout.
* **Donation pages** can embed the QR so supporters just scan and send.
* **Tipping in crypto** at events or trade shows becomes a conversation starter.
* **Apps / dApps** that want an on-chain pay feature can dynamically generate QR codes.

Since the endpoint is just a URL returning an image, it works with any front end ‚Äî web, mobile, or even digital signage.

# Caveats & bonus tips (we like to be honest)

* These QR codes are **static**: once generated, they can‚Äôt be changed. (If you need dynamic features like changing the target address, you‚Äôd need a dynamic QR system.)
* Always verify an address before broadcasting payments ‚Äî QR codes are powerful, but if someone slips in a malicious code, it could misdirect funds.
* Because QR is a standard, malformed or low contrast codes might not scan properly ‚Äî test before you publish.
* Using HTTPS ensures the QR endpoint is fetched securely (no man-in-the-middle tricks).

# Final word (in fun mode)

Your users no longer need to wrestle with long Bitcoin strings, typo risks, or clumsy copy/paste. They scan, Bitcoin does its thing, and everyone stays happy. üöÄ

* Data-driven strategies and tools you can use today

Each vendor specializes in certain categories ‚Äî for instance, some only deal in Loro Piana, others focus on shoes, Moncler jackets, Burberry items, etc. Prices and quality vary significantly between shops, so spending time exploring and comparing is essential before finalizing anything.

Baiyun Leather City Center

Baiyun primarily caters to bags, and it‚Äôs one of the most impressive markets I‚Äôve visited. Many showrooms are designed to resemble official brand stores, and it‚Äôs easy to forget you‚Äôre not in one.
They often display leather options for customization (especially for Hermes-style bags), allowing you to choose specific materials and finishes.

Most shops don‚Äôt keep ready stock ‚Äî they display samples. You select what you want or show them a reference photo, make the payment, and they deliver the items to your hotel later.

Finding a reliable seller here can be challenging, but I managed to locate a few excellent vendors. I now have verified contacts for bags, shoes, and accessories. I also came across several watch sellers, but even after inspecting the pieces myself, I decided not to buy due to price inconsistencies and doubts regarding authenticity.

Caution & Tips

Be cautious of people on the streets offering ‚Äúhigh copy‚Äù items. They usually lead you to small, hidden stores with inflated prices and poor quality.

Stick to reputable market vendors or contacts you‚Äôve verified through trusted sources.

Outside every major market, you‚Äôll find numerous cargo offices that handle packing, shipping, and even customs clearance ‚Äî very convenient if you‚Äôre purchasing in bulk.

What I Purchased

I purchased approximately 15 bags, 20 pairs of shoes, 15 belts, and various pieces of clothing.
As I also deal in kidswear, I explored potential suppliers for that segment as well and found some promising leads. I used an existing women‚Äôs clothing vendor for a few additional orders since their price and quality were already tested.

Travel & Experience

Immigration at the airport was slightly strict. They asked for my return flight details, hotel booking confirmations, purpose of visit, and how much cash I was carrying.

Hospitality was excellent. Many sellers offered snacks, drinks, and even dinner invitations.

Vegetarian food options were limited. My vegetarian friend found it difficult to manage and mostly relied on coffee, fruit juices, and basic pizza.

Final Thoughts

Overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied with the trip. The professionalism, organization, and efficiency I observed in Guangzhou were impressive. The way they conduct business ‚Äî from market structure to vendor-client relationships ‚Äî is something worth experiencing firsthand.

Even if you‚Äôre not directly involved in the replica or sourcing business, visiting China once to see how they operate can genuinely change your perspective.
I plan to visit again in January for further business development.

Choosing just on the merits of the machine and ignoring price altogether, which of the three machines in the title would be the preferred pick?

**Longer version**:    
Imagine a room. Inside the room are the three machines in the title. They are all new, not second-hand. You can carry only one, and you can never return to the room. Choosing a cheaper machine doesn‚Äôt leave you with more money to spend on something else, and you can‚Äôt sell or trade the machine, so price is not relevant at all. Which machine do you take, and why?

Per the guidelines:

*Location*: not relevant but New Zealand

*Preferred drink types*: Milk-based. Flat whites and macchiatos/piccolos

*Drink frequency*: between us, often four in the morning plus sometimes a couple through the day. And occasional batches of several for guests

*Space*: pretty generous countertop space, 650mm deep (25.5‚Äù) - in a scullery/butler‚Äôs pantry. Likely to plumb it in.

*Experience*: I make a tolerable espresso+steamed milk which I enjoy, better than at least 70% of the coffees I buy, and which pretty well everyone on this sub would immediately point out where I‚Äôm making stupid mistakes. I have everything dialled in quite reliably for the roast and blend we prefer, which we get fresh weekly. I don‚Äôt much want to explore exciting new frontiers in pressure profiles and bloom timings. I just want to reliably smash out consistently good coffees the way I like them.

*Other*: I want my machine hot and ready to go when I first walk up to it in the morning. Happy to have the power outlet on a timer as long as that gets me sorted. Also happy for the machine to have a self-wake schedule, or anything else that accomplishes that.

1o160x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o160x3/megaman_battle_network_3_black/,MegaMan Battle Network 3 BLACK,"	Video games‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre great, frustrating, challenging, etc. There‚Äôs different genres as well. Everyone has their preferences, but for me, I prefer whatever catches my eye. Games like Super Mario Bros. Sonic the Hedgehog, the Classic Mega Man Games, hell even Indie games like Undertale, Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs, the list goes on, and my style just changes at any given time. One series that hasn‚Äôt left me was the Mega Man Battle Network series, and by extension Star Force. I know, it‚Äôs not exactly the best series. BN1 and 2 were alright, 2 a bit better, but 4 was‚Ä¶ utter garbage in my opinion. 5 wasn‚Äôt all that different. 6 was definitely the best of that whole mess and a proper sendoff‚Ä¶ Kind of. Battle Network 3 though, was always my favorite. I liked the story more, not perfect, but it‚Äôs at least the best narrative in the franchise. That‚Äôs alright with me, I prefer the more realistic style that went above and beyond with the limitations they had to take into account. These games came out on the Game Boy Advance, but I also had the Legacy Collection on Steam. After a while, I felt burnt out of Mega Man as a whole. Nothing really happened, I just moved onto other things. I remember being obsessed with the Lan X Mayl, and MegaMan.EXE X Roll.EXE ships. That was a phase during that time, an embarrassing but not untrue phase. This isn‚Äôt what the story is about, but it does hold some relevance for later on. One evening, I was feeling rather bored, and decided to go out for a sweet treat at my local Starbucks. Needing the exercise, I walked to the Starbucks, and ordered a Large Venti Cookie Crumble, No Coffee, and Extra Whip Cream. They asked for my name, ‚ÄúChara‚Äù and I sat outside, looking at YouTube on my phone, watching something to pass the time. 

For those curious as to why my name is Chara. No, this isn‚Äôt my real name, I prefer to keep my privacy, so for this story, you may call me ‚ÄúChara‚Äù an abbreviation of the word ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù and yes it is pronounced like that. It‚Äôs actually funny considering there‚Äôs a character called Chara in Undertale, another series which I‚Äôm also a fan of. I even went as far as to buy the shirt on Fangamer, I felt connected to the character you could say. Regarding my brief background, I got my Game Boy Advance when I was a kid, and played a bunch of Game Boy games, like Super Mario Land 1 & 2, the Mario Advance Series, and even the Legend of Zelda A Link To The Past: Four Swords. It was a game I cried over, but over time, I came to appreciate it more as it was a gift from my grandfather. Unfortunately, I never had any Battle Network cartridges. It‚Äôs not like I needed any, I usually use emulators for games I wasn‚Äôt able to get my hands on. You guessed it, Battle Network was one of them. Since the Legacy Collection, I felt no need to emulate it, and only used emulation for other games. As I finished my drink, I started to walk back home. The sun was setting, and it was almost pitch black outside. On my way back, I noticed someone outside with a table and a bunch of stuff on it. It looked like a garage sale. I was curious as to why there was a garage sale before the sun was setting, but who knows? Maybe this was out earlier and I didn‚Äôt notice it. My neighbors are weird, man. I approached the woman running the stand, she simply greeted me, saying hello and told me to find anything she thought I was interested in. Curious, I looked through the items. They weren‚Äôt really anything of noteworthy. A couple boxes with random halloween masks, and some old bottles, wires, old clothes that looked raggedy, even books that didn‚Äôt really catch my interest. Oh wait, I guess there was a Darth Maul toy lightsaber, that looked like something I wanted to get my hands on. Aside from that, nothing much. One thing did peak my interest though. I saw something black sticking out, I grabbed it to get a closer look. It was a GBA Cartridge, turning it over I saw the game‚Äôs sticker. ‚ÄúMega Man Battle Network 3 BLACK‚Äù. It was a Battle Network game, not that I had been looking for one as I‚Äôve had the Legacy Collection on Steam. I was confused by the name though. Battle Network 3 BLACK? I‚Äôm aware the Japanese Version of BN3 BLUE was Battle Network: Rockman.EXE 3 BLACK in Japan, but then I came to the thought that maybe it was a fan-made English Translation of the Japanese Version. That thought alone made me smile. A real cartridge of one of my favorite games right in the palm of my hand. I was excited to try out the fan translation that could‚Äôve been on this cartridge, and pulled out my wallet to buy it. The woman spoke up and stopped me from taking out my money, saying that I can have it for free. I glanced at the Darth Maul Lightsaber and asked how much that was. She said it was 5 bucks, which was a really good deal. I pulled out a 5 dollar bill and a 1 dollar bill, one for the Saber and one for the game. I left it on the table and told her to keep the change. I know she said I could have the game for free, but I still wanted to leave her an extra dollar for it, just so I‚Äôd feel better about taking it. On top of that, I have a Darth Maul Lightsaber and a new game cartridge! It was a pretty good night, and felt pretty satisfied with my purchases from the garage sale. That night, I looked for my old Game Boy Advance SP I had when I was a kid, and pulled it into a charger and let it charge. To pass the time, I played with my new toy, and left the game on top of my bedside dresser, as well as played Sonic X Shadow Generations on Steam. As soon as it was done charging, it was nearly 11 in the evening, and I was excited to try out my new game I had purchased. Without any further notion, I inserted the game and turned it on.

The title screen appeared like how it did in the Japanese version, except the words were in English. ‚ÄúMega Man Battle Network 3 BLACK‚Äù It was then I realized that this was indeed an English Translation as I hit New Game. The words were in English just like in the Legacy Collection, only it seemed like the grammar was refined as I continued playing. I played through the first chapter, and went on the path of getting the license into the N1 Grand-Prix. I got some nice battle-chips to use, and I made my way through the first Chapter and beat FlashMan. There was something odd however. The Villain sequences that usually play in-between chapters didn‚Äôt play. It‚Äôs like the game just skipped them.  Either way, I still had a great time. The game just resumed and I got the GutsMan V2 Battle-Chip. I know I should‚Äôve lost that battle to make Dex seem tough in front of his little brother, but I‚Äôm one of those people who just needs to give those a reality check. Real or fictional, it felt appropriate nonetheless. What took me by surprise is that Dex actually punched Lan in the face, making him fall to the ground, Dex ran off, and the girls, Mayl and Yai rushed to his aide asking if he was alright. Though the face portrait doesn‚Äôt show the sprite‚Ä¶ It looked like it had a tiny few pixels of blood on his face, like some kind of nosebleed. What the hell? This wasn‚Äôt in the original game, I thought to myself. Sure, Dex was a character who wanted to rival Lan, but he never resorted to violence like that before. In fact, none of the Battle Network games had him ever resort to violence after losing to a Net Battle. After that whole ordeal, I went to Sci-Lab and was given a SubPET to put MegaMan in later on. First, I had to get to the next exam on the Net for the next trial of the N1 Grand Prix. I finished it with ease, and I was ready for the next phase where the connection failed between Lan and MegaMan and I had to race out manually from where Lan jacked in. However, after the screen shook, the music stopped, and the textboxes had stopped. I checked the volume just to make sure I didn‚Äôt accidentally turn it down. It was all the way up, so‚Ä¶ What gives? Surprisingly, when I accessed my menu, I heard the sound effect that plays when you open and close it. So, the volume was working, but the music‚Ä¶ stopped. I walked around as MegaMan for a while, and I found no NPCs anywhere. It‚Äôs like they all‚Ä¶ Vanished. I couldn‚Äôt even talk to Lan anymore due to FlashMan‚Äôs Flash Bang that fucked up the PET.  This wasn‚Äôt normal, usually you could still find NPCs and fight Viruses in this scenario, but to my dismay, I found no one. The screen turned to white, leading me into a virus battle. However, when the battle screen emerged, the game froze without spawning the viruses I had to fight with just the Buster, as I couldn‚Äôt access my chip folder without Lan present. However, the background was still moving, there were no viruses spawning. After a bit, a text box came up and said ‚ÄúBut Nobody Came. . .‚Äù The battle ended, sending me back to the overworld. That freaked me out as I read those words. It reminded me of Undertale‚Äôs No Mercy Route where if you kill a certain amount of monsters in one area, the next battle would tell you that phrase, but why was it playing here? I heard the soundtrack that would normally play after that message in my head. It didn‚Äôt come from the GBA speakers mind you. I tried to get back to where I initially had Lan Jack-In MegaMan, but to my dismay, that too was disabled. MegaMan‚Äôs text box came up, and had a different expression that I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to. He looked terrified, confused, like he had no idea what was going on. He didn‚Äôt say anything, just ‚Äú. . .‚Äù which I admit, I was confused too. Seeing MegaMan‚Äôs new portrait left me speechless, as that face portrait never originated in any of the Classic Battle Network games. I tried to get out of the text box, unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to. I left the area, and went back to the main network. Music finally started up, but it wasn‚Äôt the normal music that played. It was the Network is Spreading theme that usually played, only in reverse and‚Ä¶ Either slowed down or pitched down, I can‚Äôt remember. Then I saw something out of the corner of the pathway. It disappeared as soon as I saw it. Another random encounter occurred‚Ä¶ Music stopped, and the same thing as before happened. ‚ÄúBut Nobody Came. . .‚Äù Music continued after that. I saw that thing again, this time it stayed on screen and didn‚Äôt vanish off screen. It was one of those Heel Navis that are typically bad guys. Before approaching it, I wanted to save my game, just in case. When I tried to save, the game informed me that this was impossible. I was‚Ä¶ for a lack of better words, stunned. I was not able to save my game. I approached the Heel Navi cautiously. As soon as I reached him, he looked at MegaMan and a dialogue box popped up. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs looking for you. Better run while you can.‚Äù ‚Ä¶What? I was‚Ä¶ Confused. Who was looking for me? MegaMan‚Äôs face portrait appeared looking rather confused. The text box saying ‚Äú?‚Äù Like he didn‚Äôt know what the Navi meant. The text box wouldn‚Äôt close, no matter what I pressed. Considering the events that had taken place, I felt it was a sign to stop with this alternative path. I sighed and reset the game, wondering when my last save was.

The title screen booted up and I pressed continue. I was in control of Lan, strangely enough, this wasn‚Äôt all that surprising as I recall saving in the Overworld before Jacking-In, but the strange part was that MegaMan wasn‚Äôt present in my PET. More text as Lan expressed how worried he was for his Navi. A ring tone bursted the speakers as Lan‚Äôs PET rang. Lan answered it in a hurry, a text box of him saying ‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù Before the caller on the other end revealed themselves. It was Mayl. Mayl‚Äôs expression looked horrified, and her words made my blood run cold. ‚ÄúLan! Help! Someone‚Äôs in my house!! Come quick!!‚Äù The call was cut off with a girl screaming, without hesitation, I ran straight for Mayl‚Äôs house. When I got there, the lights were off, in a panic, I ran upstairs and found‚Ä¶ Something that made me disgusted. Mayl was on the ground, what looked like bruised marks on her face. Next to her was Dex, only‚Ä¶ Not exactly. The eyes of his sprite were a bright red, which made me cringe a little, but at the same time made me worried about what was going to happen next. Mayl screamed out ‚ÄúLan! H-He‚Äôs hurting me!‚Äù Before she could say another word, Dex grabbed Mayl and forcibly pulled her hair and screamed, Lan jumped in and shoved Dex off of her. Even going as far as punching him in the face, but in doing so‚Ä¶ A dialogue box with an enraged Dex portrait, said ‚ÄúYou have humiliated me for the last time, Lan Hikari!‚Äù Dex pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed Lan in the chest. Mayl screamed in horror, but Lan was still standing, and grabbed a nearby blunt object and hit his skull so hard, I heard a loud cracking sound. That made me jump, but I was more horrified at what the hell I saw. Mayl was up and holding Lan in her arms. In the background, as Mayl was grieving over Lan‚Ä¶ Some sort of black substance came out of Dex, and went onto the floor‚Ä¶ That and a mix of blood came out. I don‚Äôt know what I was looking at, but the black substance actually moved and went out of the room. Mayl was sobbing and shedding tears. The text box appeared, Mayl confessed. ‚ÄúI love you, Lan! Please. Stay with me!‚Äù Lan was in shock, but smiled after hearing that. ‚ÄúI lo-‚Äú Lan couldn‚Äôt finish his sentence, as his body dropped to the ground and he died. Mayl was grieving‚Ä¶ I hate to admit this‚Ä¶ But I actually teared up myself. I was about to shove the game off, when the screen faded to black and switched back to MegaMan. He wasn‚Äôt in the same place I was last time. He was in the Undernet area. I took back control and walked around. I was still processing everything that just went down, before a random encounter appeared‚Ä¶ Same thing as before‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut Nobody Came. . .‚Äù It was eerie at that point, because of the substance that came out of Dex. While walking around, I saw GutsMan and Roll together. They were just standing there, but immediately turned to MegaMan as I approached. Roll was the first to speak. ‚ÄúOh, Mega! Thank goodness you‚Äôre okay!‚Äù MegaMan was confused and asked ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù GutsMan answered, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. All the Navis and even viruses haven't been showing up all day, and we lost contact with our Net OPs.‚Äù Roll said, ‚ÄúThey must be worried sick about us!‚Äù MegaMan recommended, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stick together. Maybe we‚Äôll find a way back somehow.‚Äù The others nodded in agreement, and just like in‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs say the Final Fantasy games, Roll and GutsMan walked in front of MegaMan and their sprites disappeared, signifying they‚Äôre part of the party. Now, if you don‚Äôt know, there are no party systems in the Battle Network games, aside from 5, but it‚Äôs complicated to explain right now. But, as I walked through the Undernet, I saw another Heel Navi. I approached it cautiously like before. It said ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here? This is a dangerous place, especially for us! Leave now before you get deleted!‚Äù Roll took offense to that. ‚ÄúHey, watch who you‚Äôre messing with, pal or you‚Äôll be deleted!‚Äù The Heel Navi responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being serious! It won‚Äôt be me that deletes you, it‚Äôll be IT.‚Äù ‚Ä¶What the hell was ‚Äúit?‚Äù I questioned myself. ‚ÄúRun for your lives! Find a safe place to hide!‚Äù The Heel Navi ran away, and I continued onwards. I eventually made it to where you first encountered FlameMan in the game. GutsMan commented, ‚ÄúThis is a dead end. Let‚Äôs go somewhere-‚Äú SLASH. The screen went to white, when it came back, MegaMan and Roll looked at GutsMan. He was sliced in half, before he exploded and disappeared. The black substance from before was there, it was frozen‚Ä¶ Roll actually grabbed MegaMan out of fear, terrified that a pile of goop wiped out their friend. The black substance started shapeshifting‚Ä¶ Into‚Ä¶ Hub Hikari! It was black and the eyes were just as red as the ones I saw with Dex. MegaMan started speaking ‚ÄúWho are you?!‚Äù ‚Ä¶No reply. It just stood there, staring. Roll started trembling. I did as well, feeling freaked out at what I was looking at. A dialogue box finally popped up and started to speak. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶ I HATE YOU!‚Äù The shapeshifter slashed at MegaMan, Roll jumped in and got in the way. A sword was impaled in her chest. She looked horrified and coughed up what‚Ä¶ I could only assume it would be leaking data, which in a Navi‚Äôs case is basically bleeding out. MegaMan cried out, ‚ÄúROLL!!!‚Äù The shapeshifter spoke with a sinister grin on his face. ‚ÄúWhat a shame‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve actually spared you.‚Äù MegaMan pointed his Buster at him, ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ YOU!!‚Äù The screen went white again, with a sword clash sound, it faded back and MegaMan‚Äôs arm was chopped off. ‚ÄúYou pathetic excuse of a Navi.‚Äù Roll barely could speak, but managed to pull some words out, ‚ÄúM-Mega‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I failed to protect you. Just know in my heart‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always loved you.‚Äù She exploded and was deleted. MegaMan got to his knees at that point. The screen went white again, and we were in a battle scene. The music playing‚Ä¶ Was a slowed down reverb version of the incident occurrence theme‚Ä¶ MegaMan was on his side of the field, his arm completely cut off, onto his knees. The shapeshifter resembling Hub Hikari, held a red bloodied knife with a sinister smile and stared at the blue boy. He spoke, ‚ÄùWhy? Why are you doing this?‚Äù The shapeshifter responded, ‚ÄúYou took everything from me. You took my life that should‚Äôve been mine. All of your friends, rivals, enemies, everyone you knew and loved‚Ä¶ all of them are now DEAD! You‚Äôll soon join them. This place may as well be your coffin, because you‚Äôre already dead! You hear that? YOU‚ÄôRE DEAD!‚Äù With no hesitation, it broke the rules and went onto MegaMan‚Äôs field, slashed him with his knife and deleted MegaMan right on the spot, killing him. The ‚ÄúMEGAMAN DELETED‚Äù text popped up and sent me to a game over screen like nothing happened. I think I started to understand. This wasn‚Äôt really Hub Hikari. This version of him was a monster, a pure evil, psychopathic, genocidal, murderous, monster. He killed every virus, all of his friends, all for the sake of revenge. So that‚Äôs how I interpreted it anyway. After I was sent back to the title screen, the continue option was gone. I turned off the GBA, and threw the cartridge in a fit of rage. I felt very strongly about the Battle Network series, and after this experience‚Ä¶ I decided to play some baseball. While my parents were asleep, I lit up the fireplace, grabbed my toy lightsaber, and the cartridge, and battered up. I ended up knocking it into the fire. I think I broke the game on the inside when it impacted the concrete. I tried to forget about that whole ordeal when I went to sleep.

Though, my thoughts shifted of Mayl being the only one left that was still alive, while everyone else she knew and loved died. I‚Äôll never know if that Psychotic Shapeshifter came back for her or not. It‚Äôs not like it matters now. The next day, I went to that house where the garage sale was the previous night. I knocked on the door and a man answered. I asked him about the garage sale the previous night. Though, he seemed perplexed, as if he didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. I went on to tell him that there was a woman yesterday selling a bunch of stuff out here on his lawn. I described what she looked like, pale white skin, green eyes, a dazzling dress, and a silver necklace from what I recall her wearing. The man‚Äôs expression turned grim, saying that I described what his daughter looked like. She died near a lake and all that was recovered was a GBA cartridge which seems to have gone missing. He still has other things to remember her by, thankfully. I was in disbelief to hear this, as I was the one who burnt the cartridge the previous night. I thanked the man for his time and left as soon as possible. I‚Äôm still horrified at that whole experience seeing my beloved characters die the way they did. I‚Äôm not sure who that woman who sold me this game was, or what exactly her intentions were outside this man‚Äôs house. None of this makes any sense. But honestly? I‚Äôd rather I try not to make sense of it. I just want to forget about it.

I never did see that woman again. To this day, I still love MegaMan Battle Network. I now, however, spend my time playing the Classic Sonic games, as well as Minecraft and the new Deltarune chapters. However, the night after that experience, for a few weeks‚Ä¶ Every night. In my dreams, I see red eyes and a red smile, staring right at me‚Ä¶ With a bloodied knife in its hands, waiting for the perfect moment‚Ä¶ To strike me down.

Slack app that handles the HR¬†work of keeping teams connected without requiring any manual¬†effort.Core mechanics:Weekly opt-in flow:

* Monday 9 AM: Bot posts¬†""React with ü§ù"" in designated channel

* Team¬†members react to opt in for¬†that week only

* Monday¬†11 AM: Generate pairs/trios from opted-in users

* Each pair gets DM with conversation¬†starter

Recognition system:

* /bond44 recognize <user> for reason

* Creates recognition feed per¬†person

* Both users get DMs¬†(recognized person + recognizer)

* Weekly¬†summaries posted to team

Admin commands:

* /bond44 channel¬†#channel-name¬†- Set¬†pairing channel

* /bond44¬†pair¬†- Manual pairing trigger

* /bond44 status¬†- Check settings

Why this architecture:

* Opt-in per week prevents pairing fatigue

* Channel-based emoji reaction has¬†zero friction (no buttons, no forms)

* DMs keep conversations private¬†but trackable

* Set¬†once, runs indefinitely without intervention

  
Why¬†I'm Posting

Need 10 workspace installs to submit¬†to Slack App Directory.¬†Currently at 3. Looking¬†for:

* Small¬†teams (10-50 people) already using¬†Slack

* Remote¬†or hybrid setups

* No¬†dedicated HR but¬†culture matters

* Willing¬†to test¬†and give feedback

What's in it for testers:

* Free¬†forever for¬†teams under 10 people

* Personal onboarding call¬†if wanted

* Direct line¬†to me for bugs/features

* Early¬†influence on product¬†direction

1o15zf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o15zf7/i_was_a_janitor_for_the_apocalypse/,I Was A Janitor For the Apocalypse,"Let me explain why the world is a poorly designed dumpster fire.¬†It‚Äôs¬†not some grand cosmic battle.¬†It‚Äôs¬†a fucking hostile takeover by the most boring evil imaginable: a government committee. Sometime in the late 2020s, a bunch of pencil-pushers with the emotional capacity of a brick looked at the apocalypse and decided, ""You know what? We can¬†make this work.""¬†

¬†¬†

This was the¬†Observational Occurrence Bureau. Their brilliant plan? Since they¬†couldn't¬†stop society from collapsing,¬†they'd¬†just‚Ä¶ steer it. Manage the decline. Think of it as hospice care for all of humanity, but the nurses are siphoning your existential dread to power a fucking screensaver.¬†

¬†¬†

Their big discovery was that human terror‚Äîthe real, gut-clenching, ""oh-god-oh-god-oh-god"" kind‚Äîproduces a funky little energy signature they called ""Anima Flux.""¬†Basically, your¬†soul has a carbon footprint, and these¬†assholes¬†figured out how to tax it.¬†

¬†¬†

This is where I come in. My name‚Äôs Elias. I run a one-man show called ""Biometric Extermination.""¬†I‚Äôm¬†the guy you call when your reality has a leak.¬†I¬†don't¬†fight monsters;¬†I‚Äôm¬†the supernatural equivalent of a plumber for a universe with really,¬†really bad¬†pipes.¬†

¬†¬†

The system is depressingly simple:¬†

¬†¬†

**The Primer**:¬†They spiked the water supply. Not with poison, but with a metaphysical laxative. It makes you‚Ä¶ emotionally porous. Turns your nervous system into a five-star resort for¬†weird vibes.¬†

¬†¬†

**The Resonators**:¬†These are little grey boxes tucked away in substations and basements. They¬†don't¬†broadcast a signal you can hear. They broadcast a void.¬†And that void¬†tells your Primed-up brain to take your deepest, most specific fear and just‚Ä¶¬†puke¬†it all over your living room. They call this elegant process a ""Transpiration."" I call it a bio-hazardous mood swing.¬†

¬†¬†

The resulting gunk, this refined fear-juice they call ""Sanguine Prime,"" gets sucked through a hidden sewer system‚Äîthe ""Lachrymal Grid""‚Äîto power some big, silent computer¬†that's¬†probably just¬†generating endless PDFs of new regulations. Thrilling, I know. My job was to be the cleanup crew for this cosmic vomiting. The case that really cemented my career choice as a fucking mistake was the Hancock¬†house.¬†

¬†¬†

The place smelled like a candy store owned by a mortician. The living room wall was crying these thick, amber tears that arranged themselves in perfect hexagons, because even reality-breaking phenomena¬†have to¬†be fucking orderly about it.¬†

¬†¬†

But the real show was the personalized terror. Mr. Hancock¬†was paranoid. His fear of being watched manifested as dozens of perfectly human eyeballs pushing out of the hallway drywall.¬†They‚Äôd¬†follow you. One of them winked at me. I¬†didn't¬†know whether to scream or¬†blush.¬†

¬†¬†

Their daughter was afraid of the dark. Her closet¬†wasn't¬†just a closet anymore; it was a slab of solid, breathing nothingness. A void with a five-o'clock shadow. It was humming¬†My Name Is Mud.¬†Don't¬†ask me why.¬†

¬†¬†

The master bedroom was Mrs. Hancock‚Äôs domain. Her fear of cancer had turned her side of the room into a goddamn biology textbook from hell. The floral wallpaper had sprouted fleshy polyps, the carpet was a tumorous membrane, and the pillows had merged into a single, pulsing mass that looked like a sad lung trying to learn how to breathe. Cheery stuff.¬†

¬†¬†

And then there was the kitchen. A single chrome chair was turned perfectly inside out. Not broken. Inverted. It was the most philosophically confused piece of furniture¬†I‚Äôve¬†ever seen, and it was still standing there, judging my life choices.¬†

¬†¬†

My friend Leo, a conspiracy theorist who mainlines coffee and¬†honey packs, was the one who connected the dots. He saw my work orders and the city's utility maps and had a eureka moment that¬†probably violated¬†several health codes.¬†

¬†¬†

We decided to grow a conscience, which is always a terrible idea. We found a Resonator in a cheap apartment building. The Transpiration there was a symphony of urban anxiety: walls sweating rust, the sound of a thousand deadbolts clicking shut.¬†

¬†¬†

We were too late. The harvesters showed up in their silent, grey vans. They stuck probes into the nightmares and drained the color and sound right out of them. Then they led the people out. The people were‚Ä¶ empty. Just shells. They moved like¬†they‚Äôd¬†just sat through a three-day corporate seminar.¬†

¬†¬†

One of the harvesters looked right at us. He¬†didn't¬†pull a gun. He just pointed. It was the most bureaucratic ""you're next""¬†I've¬†ever received.¬†

¬†¬†

So now¬†we're¬†on the run. The world is being systematically terrified into a neat, orderly, and emotionally sterile paperweight, and¬†I'm¬†out of a job because I finally developed a moral objection to being the janitor for the end of the world.¬†",1,1759916468.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

To simplify what happened. Me(29m) and my wife(29f)
And our kids went away for the weekend camping. For some reason I decided to put a camera in our bedroom.

We up on returning I checked the camera and caught the house mate entering out bedroom it was dark so could see exactly what he took but could see he went the my wife's wardrobe.

After showing my wife she confronted him and he denied it until we told him we had it on camera. Then he claimed he entered out bedroom to borrow lube???? So he could wank. 

Whilst it's hard to say if it's true or not. We do have a big bottle of lube I purchased years ago that is nearly every used. So I went and checked it and sure enough it basically empty. 

So now I have a few problems. As this indicates his been entering our room multiple times as the lube being gone as well as he knew exactly where in the bedroom to look. This a long with the fact I only rearranged the bedroom 2 months ago means he knew the new spot it was placed. 

The next problem I have with him coming in besides the fact it is my personal space is that 
We keep everything in our room from our family safe. Legal documents, personal belongings. And the wardrobe he entered is where my wife keeps her underwear and such as well. 

To top it all off I've always had the rule of no one in my room. Not even cleaners if we have them come. 

So with this having happened I reached out to him and his mother as he does everything through her. 
And sent her a very honest text you can read below:

Hi ((the mother) and (tenant). 

I'm not going to beat around the bush. What (tenant) has done has broken the most serious of boundaries and trust. 

I refuse to accept any excuses. Because frankly there's isn't one.

Allowing (tenant) into our living room and kitchen to help himself to our coffee,oven,ECT was out of our kindness and hospitality. 

Entering our private room and stealing from us has completely crossed the line and can't be down played we also know this has been several times in the last two months and probably more. 

Worst he lied straight to (wife) face when asked so I can't believe anything further he says regarding the manner of why. We keep many personal things in our room our family safe, documents. Mel's and my personal items. I don't know what the real reason he went in there but none are acceptable.

We fostered a relationship and helped (tenant) in many ways to help him grow. But a long the way the help just manifested into enablement and given him the ability to endulge In bad habits like gambling. 

We set our boundaries with (tenant) so very low and he stomped all over them. 

My job is to maintain the feeling safety in this house which I thought (tenant) understood. I can no longer do so with (tenant) here. Although I dont think it's deserved at all I'm willing to allow (tenant)up to a month to organize alternative accomodation going forward. 

His current outstanding bills are the power for September $25
And recent water delivery of $55. Rent will still be expected uptill the soonest Wednesday he resides here. And (wife) laptop that was lent returned before moving out. 

I wish (tenant) the best going forward but that isn't here anymore.

Both promise quick, flavorful cups, but they work in very different ways.**

You may have heard people talk about espresso shots and K-Cups, but do you really know what sets these machines apart? Understanding these differences can help you decide which fits your taste, lifestyle, and budget best. Keep reading, and you‚Äôll discover why one might be the perfect match for your coffee cravings while the other serves a completely different experience.

Let‚Äôs dive into what makes an espresso machine and a Keurig unique, so you can make the best choice for your perfect cup.

# Espresso Machine Basics

Understanding the basics of espresso machines helps explain how they differ from Keurig brewers. Espresso machines use pressure to extract rich flavors from finely ground coffee. This process creates a concentrated, bold shot of espresso. The machine‚Äôs design and operation are key to making authentic espresso.

# How Espresso Machines Work

Espresso machines force hot water through tightly packed coffee grounds. This water passes quickly under high pressure. The result is a small, strong coffee shot. The entire process takes about 25 to 30 seconds. This quick extraction keeps the coffee‚Äôs rich taste and aroma intact.

# Pressure And Extraction

Pressure is essential for making real espresso. Most machines use 9 bars of pressure or more. This pressure pushes water through the coffee grounds evenly. It extracts oils and flavors that create a creamy foam called crema. Without this pressure, espresso cannot develop its signature taste or texture.

# Types Of Espresso Machines

[Espresso machines](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-machines/)¬†come in different styles to fit various needs. Manual machines require users to control pressure by hand. Semi-automatic models automate pressure but need some user input. Fully automatic machines handle the entire process with one button. Each type offers a unique coffee experience.

# Keurig Coffee Maker Basics

[Keurig coffee makers](https://gomehedi.com/best-keurig-coffee/)¬†offer a quick and easy way to brew coffee. These machines use pre-packaged pods called K-Cups. They are popular for their convenience and variety of flavors. Keurig machines are designed for single-serve coffee, making them perfect for busy mornings or offices.

The simplicity of Keurig machines appeals to many users. You just insert a pod, press a button, and get your coffee in minutes. No need to grind beans or measure coffee. This section explains how Keurig machines work, their brewing process, and popular models.

# How Keurig Machines Work

Keurig machines use a needle to pierce the K-Cup pod. Hot water is forced through the pod under low pressure. The water extracts coffee flavors and drips into your cup. The process is fast and clean, without any mess of loose grounds.

Each K-Cup contains a single serving of coffee. The machine controls water temperature and flow for consistent results. This design offers convenience but limits the ability to customize coffee strength or size.

# Brewing Process

First, fill the Keurig water reservoir with fresh water. Place your favorite K-Cup pod in the holder. Close the lid to puncture the pod‚Äôs foil top. Select your cup size and press the brew button.

The machine heats water quickly to around 200¬∞F (93¬∞C). It pumps water through the pod at low pressure. Coffee flows directly into your cup within a minute. The used pod ejects automatically or manually, depending on the model.

# Popular Keurig Models

The Keurig K-Classic is a simple and affordable choice. It brews multiple cup sizes and has a large water reservoir. The Keurig K-Elite offers stronger brew settings and iced coffee options. The K-Cafe adds a milk frother for lattes and cappuccinos.

Each model fits different needs and budgets. All maintain Keurig‚Äôs easy-to-use pod system. They vary in features like brew strength, water capacity, and milk frothing ability.

# Pressure Differences

Pressure plays a key role in the coffee brewing process. It affects taste, texture, and aroma. Espresso machines use high pressure to extract bold flavors. Keurig machines, on the other hand, operate at much lower pressure. This difference creates distinct coffee experiences. Understanding pressure helps explain why espresso tastes different from Keurig coffee.

# Importance Of High Pressure In Espresso

Espresso machines push water through coffee grounds at about 9 bars of pressure. This high pressure forces out oils and flavors quickly. It also creates a creamy layer called crema on top. Crema adds aroma and a smooth texture to espresso. Without high pressure, espresso cannot develop its signature strong and rich taste. This is why pressure is crucial in espresso brewing.

# Keurig‚Äôs Low-pressure Brewing

Keurig machines use pressure below 2 bars, much lower than espresso machines. They rely on hot water dripping through coffee pods. This method extracts flavor gently but misses espresso‚Äôs intensity. Keurig coffee lacks the crema and dense body of espresso. Some Keurig models offer a ‚Äúshot‚Äù option for stronger coffee. Still, these drinks do not match true espresso because of low pressure.

# Coffee Quality And Flavor

Coffee quality and flavor vary greatly between espresso machines and Keurig brewers. The brewing process, pressure, and coffee type affect the taste and texture. Understanding these differences helps choose the right machine for your preferences. Below, we explore the unique flavor profiles and qualities of each machine.

# Espresso Crema And Flavor Profile

Espresso machines force hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure. This process extracts rich oils and flavors quickly. A key feature is the crema, a golden foam atop the espresso shot. Crema adds a smooth texture and enhances aroma.

The flavor is bold, intense, and concentrated. Espresso often has notes of chocolate, caramel, and fruit. The crema contributes a velvety mouthfeel. This depth makes espresso a favorite for those who enjoy strong coffee.

# Keurig Coffee Taste Characteristics

Keurig machines brew coffee by dripping hot water through a coffee pod. The pressure is much lower than in espresso machines. This method produces a lighter, milder cup of coffee.

The taste varies depending on the pod and coffee blend used. Generally, Keurig coffee is less intense with fewer oils extracted. It has a cleaner, simpler flavor without crema. The convenience suits casual drinkers who prefer quick, easy coffee.

# Pod And Capsule Options

Choosing between an espresso machine and a Keurig often involves considering pod and capsule options. Both machines use pods, but their types and varieties differ significantly. This affects flavor, convenience, and the overall coffee experience.

# Espresso Capsules Variety

Espresso machines use capsules designed for high-pressure extraction. These capsules come in many flavors and blends. Many brands offer single-origin and flavored espresso pods. The capsules are sealed to keep coffee fresh. They produce rich, thick espresso with crema on top. Capsules fit specific machines, such as Nespresso or Lavazza. This variety lets users enjoy authentic espresso at home.

# Keurig K-cups Range

Keurig uses K-Cups that hold ground coffee, tea, or other drinks. These pods come in many flavors and brands. K-Cups offer more than espresso-style coffee; they brew regular coffee, hot chocolate, and even iced beverages. The pods are simple to use and widely available. They brew coffee at lower pressure, so coffee tastes lighter than espresso. K-Cups provide fast and easy coffee with many flavor choices.

# Reusable Pod Options

Both espresso machines and Keurig offer reusable pods. These pods let users fill coffee grounds directly. Reusable pods reduce waste and save money. They allow users to customize coffee strength and flavor. Espresso machine reusable capsules are often metal or plastic. Keurig reusable K-Cups are plastic with a mesh filter. Reusable pods suit those who want eco-friendly and flexible coffee options.

# Espresso-like Options On Keurig

Keurig machines are known for their convenience and quick brewing. They do not make traditional espresso due to pressure limits. Still, some models offer espresso-like options. These options deliver a strong, concentrated coffee similar to espresso. It is not the same as espresso but good for those who want a richer coffee taste.

This section explains how certain Keurig machines come close to espresso. It also covers the use of espresso-roast pods and how to brew a stronger coffee shot.

# Keurig K-cafe And Rivo Models

The Keurig K-Cafe has a special ‚Äúshot‚Äù button for espresso-style coffee. It brews a concentrated coffee using espresso-roast pods. The now-discontinued Rivo model was designed to make espresso-style drinks with some foam. Both models try to mimic espresso but do not use high pressure like real espresso machines.

# Using Espresso-roast Pods

Espresso-roast pods have darker, stronger coffee grounds. These pods help create a bolder, richer coffee taste. Using these pods in a Keurig machine results in a cup with deeper flavor. It‚Äôs closer to espresso but without the crema or thick foam on top.

# Brewing A Concentrated Shot

Keurig machines cannot reach the 9 bars of pressure needed for true espresso. They use lower pressure to brew coffee. To get a stronger shot, use the ‚Äúshot‚Äù button on compatible models. This makes a smaller, more concentrated cup. It tastes like espresso but lacks the crema layer.

# Convenience And Usability

Choosing between an espresso machine and a Keurig often comes down to convenience and usability. Both machines serve coffee lovers but differ in setup, speed, and cleaning. Understanding these aspects helps pick the right coffee maker for your daily routine.

# Setup And Maintenance

Espresso machines usually require more setup. You need to fill water tanks, grind beans, and adjust settings. They might need some learning before use. Keurig machines come mostly pre-assembled. Just add water and insert a coffee pod. Maintenance for espresso machines can be complex. Regular descaling and part cleaning are necessary. Keurig machines require less upkeep. Pods keep the machine cleaner and reduce mess.

# Speed And Ease Of Use

Keurig machines brew coffee quickly. Press a button, and your drink is ready in under a minute. Espresso machines take longer. Grinding, tamping, and brewing take extra time. Keurig offers simple, one-touch operation. Espresso machines need more hands-on work. This makes Keurig better for fast, easy coffee.

# Cleaning Requirements

Espresso machines need daily cleaning of the portafilter and steam wand. Milk frothers also require thorough rinsing. Keurig machines only need occasional water tank cleaning. Pods prevent coffee grounds from clogging. This means less mess and fewer steps to clean. Overall, Keurig machines are easier to keep clean.

# Cost Comparison

Cost plays a big role in choosing between an espresso machine and a Keurig. Both machines serve coffee lovers but differ in price points. Understanding the cost differences helps you pick the best option for your budget and needs.

# Initial Investment

Espresso machines usually cost more upfront. Basic models start around $100 but can go well over $500 for quality machines. High-end espresso makers with advanced features cost even more. Keurig machines are generally cheaper. Basic Keurig models start as low as $70. Mid-range models with extra features cost around $150 to $200. The initial price reflects the complexity and technology inside each machine.

# Ongoing Pod And Coffee Costs

Keurig uses single-use pods called K-Cups. These pods cost about $0.70 to $1.50 each. The cost adds up if you drink multiple cups daily. Espresso machines use ground coffee or pods, depending on the model. Ground coffee is cheaper and costs about $0.25 to $0.50 per shot. Espresso pods are similar in price to Keurig pods but offer fewer options. Buying beans and grinding at home lowers the ongoing cost significantly.

# Best Use Cases

Choosing between an espresso machine and a Keurig depends on how and where you want to enjoy your coffee. Each machine serves a different purpose and fits distinct lifestyles. Understanding the best use cases helps pick the right coffee maker for your needs.

# Ideal Users For Espresso Machines

Espresso machines suit coffee lovers who enjoy strong, rich coffee. They prefer the authentic espresso experience with crema and a thick texture. People who like to customize drinks, like cappuccinos or lattes, benefit from espresso machines. These users often have time to prepare their coffee carefully. They enjoy the ritual of grinding beans and steaming milk. Home baristas and coffee enthusiasts find espresso machines rewarding.

# Ideal Users For Keurig Machines

Keurig machines are perfect for those who want quick and simple coffee. They work well in busy homes or offices where speed matters. Users who enjoy variety appreciate the wide range of K-Cup flavors. Keurig suits people who want less cleanup and fuss. It is also ideal for sharing, as it brews one cup at a time. Convenience and ease of use attract many to Keurig machines.

# Making The Right Choice

Choosing between an espresso machine and a Keurig depends on what fits your daily coffee needs. Both machines offer different benefits and suit different types of coffee drinkers. Understanding these differences helps you make the right choice for your kitchen and taste buds.

# Assessing Coffee Preferences

Espresso machines make strong, rich coffee with a thick crema on top. They are perfect for those who enjoy bold, concentrated flavors or like to make lattes and cappuccinos. Keurig machines brew a variety of coffee styles, from light to dark roasts, with a simpler and quicker process. They suit people who want a mild and easy cup of coffee without extra steps.

# Considering Lifestyle And Budget

Espresso machines often require more time, effort, and money. They need grinding, tamping, and cleaning after each use. Keurig machines are faster and easier, using pods that simplify brewing. They cost less upfront and save time. Your daily routine and budget play a key role in deciding which machine fits best in your life.

Hello and welcome to part 2 of part 5!! I won‚Äôt write anymore for this bit as you‚Äôve probably read my rambles from the previous bit BUT I hope you enjoy the rest of part 5 Ÿ©(‡πë‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ‡πë)€∂

##The Journey (2)

The rest of the journey, including one more connection flight on a bigger plane in which Cheng Xiaoshi took another nap, was smooth sailing and Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't resist the urge to let out a sigh of relief as they waited for their luggage.

""You glad that you don't need to go on anymore planes?"" Lu Guang comments; a multitude of different suitcases passing them by on the large baggage carousel. 

""Definitely!"" He chimes, stretching out all the aches in his muscles. ""I don't know how much longer I could've coped! 'Specially with how that last plane landed! It was so bumpy brain was shaking!""

""It wasn't that bad."" Lu Guang states before letting out a bemused chuckle. ""You're over-exaggerating.""

""Na-ah!"" He stubbornly objects. ""I felt it as the plane went onto the landing and you can't deny that!""

""...Idiot."" Lu Guang replies with a shake of his head.

He goes to wrap his arm around his friend but Lu Guang successfully dodges from his grasp as he makes his way over to their luggage which had just come around the corner of the baggage carousel.

Pouting to himself, Cheng Xiaoshi follows after him and proceeds to help out with getting their items off the continuously moving conveyor belt.

""You're lucky I..."" He mutters under his breath before pacing away from Lu Guang.

""You're going the wrong way."" Lu Guang states before he could go too far.

Unable to fight the burning sensation that had washed over his entire face, Cheng Xiaoshi actively kept his gaze away from his friend as he took a sharp turn; making sure that his feet were leading him in the right direction.

He only slowed down his pace when he reached the public bathroom and was more than happy to, once he had finished with his business, douse his entire face with cool water. The liquid was just enough to reduce his flustered cheeks and was the jolt he needed to compose himself.

That was until he exited the public bathroom and witnessed a scene that forced him to stifle a giggle.

A young girl had called his dear friend a kitty before being taken away from her mother. Lu Guang's sigh was priceless and-

""I told you."" Lu Guang's voice sliced through his internal musings but Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't help but smirk in response; peeking his head from behind the wall. ""This outfit looks weird."" 

""Come on, dude!"" He replies, striding over to him before flashing a self-assured thumbs up. ""Who cares what other people think! All you need is confidence! I mean, you can't not wear the hat otherwise you wouldn't be the perfect anime club member oooooor their main coser!""

Without a word, Lu Guang slaps his hand away and begins to walk away.

""Are you blushing??"" Cheng Xiaoshi remarks, cheerfully following after his absconding friend as a grin continued to spread across his face. ""That's so cute!""

Without warning, Lu Guang came to a sudden stop; instead of the embarrassed nature that had surrounded his friend and loosened his arms, a tension drew his shoulders together and chased away his own playfulness.

He didn't remember this happening.

Especially not the look of distress on Lu Guang's face as, like a terrified kitty whose senses were fully heightened, he watches a stranger walk past them. Someone Cheng Xiaoshi was sure they had never met before.

He wanted to mention something. To ask Lu Guang what was wrong but, before he allowed himself to divert from the script, a dead Lu Guang and a sobbing Qiao Ling flashed in his mind.

After taking a deep breath, he resumed the film and attempted to read lines that were almost impossible to see.

""What are you looking for?"" He asks with a gentle tap on Lu Guang's shoulder; glancing in the direction his friend was staring in. ""Do you see a hottie? Or maybe a babe?""

Scanning his attention around the airport, he spots a familiar looking poster and lets out an overdramatic gasp.

""Hottie spotted!"" He chirps before approaching the advertisement which had a young man with two-toned hair and a rather attractive smirk. The camera the photographer used must have had good exposure and maybe with a convex lens. Either way, they looked stunning! ""Lu Guang, look at this! I think he might be mixed-race!""

Even though he knew who this was, Cheng Xiaoshi still leans forward and reads off the writing on the poster. ""Felix... I think he was on the cover of that magazine Qiao Ling bought, right? The one she made me buy for her.""

""Let's go."" He hears Lu Guang mumble, the speckles of vulnerability now reaching his ears and glimmering in his gaze.

""Right..."" Cheng Xiaoshi gazes at his friend for a few moments before clearing his throat; painting on his usual cheerfulness. ""I just need to snap a pic for reference. I'll be real quick!"" 

Ignoring the tension in his own body, he goes to reach for his phone-

The sudden sensation of someone's arm in his tight grip was enough for Cheng Xiaoshi to realise that his body had gone into autopilot and, while he had regrettably made many mistakes in the past, this had got to be his dumbest.

Crap.

Having subconsciously relied on information he wasn't meant to know, Cheng Xiaoshi had managed to stop the crook in his tracks. His back pocket still housed his phone and the pickpocket had been unsuccessful. 

That was until the thief went to take a swing at his face.

Cheng Xiaoshi should have taken the hit.

He should have allowed the flow of time to return to where it was meant to go and for the stream to flow back to its routes. He should have realised that this was just a really stupid slip up on his behalf and things would be fine if he could sort things out before Lu Guang turns around and sees what he had done.

There was a lot Cheng Xiaoshi should have done but, with a sense of justice that prevailed over all, all it took was a swift dodge and sharp upper cut directly to the crook's jaw for him to stumble and drop to his knee.

It didn't knock the hooligan out but it was enough to stun and, before they could try again, Cheng Xiaoshi grabbed his suitcase handle and paced to Lu Guang; wrapping an arm around his friend and quickening their pace.

Lu Guang gave him a questioning look but didn't say anything as they weaved through crowds of people; distancing themselves from what had just happened.

But, even when they had got in a taxi, Cheng Xiaoshi could still feel the biting frost lingering upon his shoulders. His leg shook with restless unease and he watched as the many buildings whizzed past them.

""You doing alright?"" 

""Huh?"" Cheng Xiaoshi blurts out before turning to face Lu Guang who was staring at him with an unreadable expression. ""Oh. Just excited to see what the hotel room will look like, that's all.""

""You sure?""

He gazes at the other for a few moments before nodding his head and letting out a less than convincing chuckle. ""Maybe the nerves are making me extra car sick?""

""You don't get car sick."" 

""Maybe today's the day? You never know when it comes to those kinds of things.""

""Idiot."" Lu Guang states before, without warning, ruffling Cheng Xiaoshi's hair.

That was enough to completely shut down his mind and, even when Lu Guang had turned his attention to the outside world that was passing them by, Cheng Xiaoshi could still feel the pressure of his friends hand and how his fingers had tussled the strands of his hair.

Sheepishly, he fiddles with one of the messy strands as he listens to the blood rushing in his ears and the pounding of his pulse; it's fluttering dance persisting all the way until they made it to their hotel room and Lu Guang was unzipping his suitcase.

The room was as standard as they came with two single beds, paired with their own lamp and bedside table. The thin curtains fluttered in the breeze escaping from window, which could only open a few inches at most, and a kettle was perched on the desk together with some tea, coffee, milk and sugar. There was even a small mini fridge and a clothing line that Lu Guang was currently putting his clothes on.

Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't help but subconsciously note the distance between the two beds and, just like the first time, he took it upon himself to push them together; ensuring that he would be as close to his friend as possible. And, just like last time, Lu Guang didn't make a single comment.

Flopping on the beds, Cheng Xiaoshi vacantly watched as the other continued to sort out their home for the next few days. Taking in the way Lu Guang would straighten out any creases the clothes could have before carefully hanging them up and moving to the next article of clothing. How, as if this task was a math problem just waiting to be solved, he would organise each type of garment and make sure that they were in the right section.

A sense of domesticity washed over the dark haired young man as he silently observed the way his friend's hands would work, how his eyes took in his next task before carrying it out and how he'd sometimes absentmindedly stick out his tongue when he was pondering his next steps.

Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't take his eyes off Lu Guang.

That was until he turned around to look at him with a raised brow and Cheng Xiaoshi had to fight the urge to smoother his face in one of the pillows.

""Do you have the photograph?"" Lu Guang asks, not so carefully moving Cheng Xiaoshi's legs out of the way before taking a seat on the bed.

""Yep!"" He chirps before raising to his knees and pulling out the item in question. ""I don't need to turn away this time, do I?""

All it took was a look from Lu Guang, as well as for him to take off the kitty hat and shove it on Cheng Xiaoshi's own head, to confirm that he could do whatever he wanted before his friend turned his attention onto the photo. All it took was a few moments to pass by for Lu Guang to use him ability but Cheng Xiaoshi knew that it must have felt longer for his friend to experience those twelve hours. All it took was this one moment to get the ball rolling down the right lane. 

Or that's what Cheng Xiaoshi hoped as they left the hotel and made their way towards the bookstore; having to use the Bridon underground and enduring the immense amount of heat that came with it.

Luckily, it didn't take too long to reach their destination but, it was still a surprise to see how different the building had become compared to the photograph. Most of the exterior was dressed with scaffolding and the bookstore, with wide windows that exposed the interior of the building, was the only thing that proved that the building hadn't been completely abandoned. The warm glow of the lights inside barely showing that the store was indeed open for business; only noticeable due to the setting sun.

This would be where they would find the book they were after.

Shakespeare's Sonnets.

Upon entering the store, a friendly looking old man with a beard that would make an man attempting to grow out their own beard extremely jealous, helped them locate the book they were after before leaving the two of them to their own endeavours.

Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't help but note how it was interesting that this book in particular had stopped being issued and how it had remained in this place for so long. He'd heard how famous Shakespeare had been so he would have assumed that a book like this would have found a home in some collectors house rather than collecting dust.

After pocketing those thoughts for another day, he flicked through the pages until he landed on pages 28 and 29 but, unlike what he had assumed, Cheng Xiaoshi came to see that there was no sign of his father's rough writing.

He let out a hum in thought before sparing a glance at Lu Guang.

They had found the word before so then where was-

Letting out a sharp gasp, a memory suddenly clicked into place and Cheng Xiaoshi was able to recall what had happened; brushing his fingertips against the course page was enough to confirm that he was on the right path.

All he needed was a piece of paper and a pencil!

Telling Lu Guang the plan, Cheng Xiaoshi took the tools out of his hand and carefully shaded in the area he had a feeling the word would be and, sure enough, the letters began to reveal themselves.

B         A         H         A         T         I

After a quick google search, as well as a root through his own memories, it was safe to deduce that there was only one location in Bridon under the name 'Bahati' and Cheng Xiaoshi was NOT looking forward to it.

If only that match hadn't been playing but, knowing that this was a path he needed to follow, he was unable to make even a single protest as they made their way to the pub.

It was just as he remembered with a high ceiling decorated in rather elegant looking light fixtures, a few tables consisted of large barrels and a bar fitted out with what seemed to be the most popular beer. He also remembered the rowdy group of men kitted out in their teams kit and seconds away from fighting people in their own group.

Actively ignoring the football hooligans, Cheng Xiaoshi followed Lu Guang to one of the tables and had almost wished he had taken the seat against the wall during the first timeline; not wanting to have his back facing the bar.

In an attempt to silence his mind from whining, he picked up one of the menus and began to check all the options they had. What had he got last time? He remembered Xia Fei had recommended a couple things for him but-

The menu Cheng Xiaoshi had picked up was English.

If only he had studied SOME English before this trip as that would have allowed him to attempt to decipher what he could try! It's not his fault he didn't think this far ahead... Or was it behind?

""I'll see if they have a Chinese menu."" Lu Guang spoke up before leaving the table and approaching one of the staff members; the yells from the group of men making it impossible for Cheng Xiaoshi to hear what was being said.

But, even if that was the case, he was unable to look away from his roommate; taking in every little movement he could make out. It was something he was used to seeing when the two worked in the photo studio and Cheng Xiaoshi would spare a few glances at Lu Guang whilst he spoke to clients but, somehow, this felt different.

Maybe it was the atmosphere. Maybe it was because he had experienced this moment before and was therefore able to pick out details he had missed. Maybe, just maybe, it was because the target of his gaze was Lu Guang of all people.

It didn't take long before his friend re-joined him at the table. There were two menus in his hand and, after taking one of them and happily perusing a menu he now had the ability to read, Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't stop himself from letting out a light-hearted cheer when he noticed the twinkle of triumph in the other's gaze.

""Thank you, Lu Guang!"" He chirps, actively making sure that he didn't raise his voice too loudly in fear of drawing unwanted attention. ""I don't know what I'd do without you!""

""Idiot,"" was the only response he received from Lu Guang before the other gently tapped him on the head with the remaining menu and returned to his seat.

He lets out a chortle before taking the chance to look at the options that were available to them. 

What had he got last time? Was it the burger? He wasn't too sure, but, he had remembered how Xia Fei had told them that the only decent things on offer were the items with a thumbs up next to their name.

So, there was the London Burger and, Cheng Xiaoshi turns the page, haddock and chips.

One of the pages addressed the alcohol on offer which consisted of a multitude of ciders, lagers and wines. There were even a few cocktails Cheng Xiaoshi took the honour of knowing.

But, before he could point this out to Lu Guang, something clicked in his mind and he was once again brought to the stage; blaring lights shinning down upon him and waiting for his line.

""Really, I can't believe my Dad used to go to a place like this."" Cheng Xiaoshi comments. ""It's a bit..."" He trails off for dramatic effect before glancing at the drunken residents at the bar. ""You sure there aren't any other places called Bahati?""

""This is the only place."" Lu Guang replies, keeping his attention on his own menu. ""Why don't you ask around and see if anyone knew him? I know how much of a people person you are.""

""Just because I can talk to strangers doesn't mean I can question them."" He grumbles with a pout. ""I mean, what would you do if some random dude went up to you and was like, 'did you know my Dad?' I can't do that!""

""Then what are you going to do?"" His friend questions but, before Cheng Xiaoshi could reply, he heard the approaching footsteps and knew exactly what was going to happen next.

""Uhm, excuse me?"" A familiar voice spoke to an almost gentle tone. ""Do you mind if I sit with you?""

""Go for it."" Cheng Xiaoshi replies, timing just how long he should keep his eyes glued on the menu.

""Thanks. There's not that many free spaces left with so many lions fans about.""

Allowing the excitement of reuniting with an old friend take over for a few moments, he found himself letting out a gasp and spinning around to look at Xia Fei.

""I've seen you before!"" He states cheerfully before drawing in his exhilaration as Xia Fei places a finger to his lips. He watches as the model signals to one of the staff before taking a seat next to him.

""Have you ordered anything yet?""

Cheng Xiaoshi shakes his head. ""Do you know what's good?""

""Well,"" Xia Fei begins before leaning over and pointing at one of the options on the menu that had a thumbs up next to it. ""Anything with one of these is guaranteed to be good. Anything else? Well, that's a bit of a dice roll.""

""Is that from you or the owner?"" Cheng Xiaoshi quips playfully before he can stop himself.

Xia Fei gazes at him for a moment before letting out a chuckle. ""From the owner himself. Things could have changed from when I worked here but, I highly doubt it.""

""You used to work here?"" 

The model gives a nod of his head before three pints of lager are placed onto their table.

""Then, maybe you could help me."" Cheng Xiaoshi replies, carefully reading through the mental script in his mind and making sure that he followed each word as close to the original as possible. ""Bahati. What's the story?""

Unlike before, he notes the slight widening of Xia Fei's eyes and the almost tense posture that overtakes the model before completely dissipating as if it never happened; as if the change in mood was nothing more than a blip in the system.

Before he can properly observe the model, Lu Guang clears his throat and takes over the conversation at hand. ""We're looking for someone and the only clue we have is the name of this pub.""

""I see."" Xia Fei replies before slouching forward a little and rests his chin on the back of his hand. ""I really wish I could help but the boss never told me why he named this place Bahati of all things.""

A few moments of silence pass before, as if something had suddenly clicked in his mind, Xia Fei lets out a gasp. ""Wait, you could just meet the owner yourself! Are you free tomorrow morning or do you have anywhere else to be?""

After sparing a glance in Lu Guang's direction, Cheng Xiaoshi gives a more than grateful nod of his head; taking the model's hands into his own. ""That would be awesome! I mean, so long as he knows Chinese because my English skills are basically none existent!""

""You'll be fine."" Xia Fei smiles. ""And, if you get stuck, well, I'm more than willing to help.""

Cheng Xiaoshi's grin widens even more as he continues to shake Xia Fei's hand. ""Lu Guang, we really do keep meeting the nicest of people!"" He remarks cheerfully before finally letting go of the model's hands; ultimately allowing him to stop Lu Guang from drinking the beer he'd been gifted.

""Before we get to drinking, introductions are in order!"" Xia Fei chimes cheerfully before gesturing at himself. ""I'm Xia Fei.""

""Oh! I'm Cheng Xiaoshi and this is Lu Guang!"" His roommate gives a nod of his head as he's introduced. ""We really gotta thank you for doing this for us! You didn't have to!""

""Don't worry about it."" Xia Fei. ""How about we make a toast?""

""To meeting new friends?"" He suggests as Lu Guang continues to silently listen to them; nursing the glass of beer in his hands.

""Yeah! To making new friends!""

All three of their glasses clink together before Cheng Xiaoshi gulps down the refreshing beverage.

It wasn't long before they had consumed a vast amount of different meals from the menu and drank a few pints of beer. Memories of comforting a drunk Xia Fei almost seemed to overlap with his current reality and an overwhelming sense of d√©j√† vu washed over him; soaking through every pore in his body and making him feel like he was in a movie he had no control over.

Like an NPC in a game he couldn't play.

Quickly shrugging off the feeling of dread before it could clog up his throat, Cheng Xiaoshi allowed himself to take in Lu Guang. He'd expected some hint of red on his friends cheeks, or some physical symptom to expose the amount of drinks he'd consumed on his own but, Lu Guang looked as sober as he did when they entered the pub.

Still, there was a hint of something in his friends gaze which, annoyingly, Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't point out what it was.

In the original loop, he'd assumed Lu Guang was tipsy and he was struggling to remain in the moment but, that didn't seem right anymore.

It was a look he had vague memories of.

A look Lu Guang would sometimes get if Cheng Xiaoshi was a little too chummy with one of their classmates or...

Huh?

His mind came to a sudden stop.

Was Lu Guang jealous?

Cheng Xiaoshi wanted to question it but, as if it was the one missing piece to complete the puzzle, he couldn't.

But, the moment was approaching. He had no time for thinking about the implications of this revelation and no time to attempt to comprehend how his own feelings would tie into everything.

The results of the match were imminent and, unlike the previous time he had been here, he wasn't as drunk. But, that didn't mean his cheeks weren't flushed and his mind didn't feel like his thoughts were hidden under a layer of haze.

Maybe Cheng Xiaoshi should have attempted to drink even less this time? But, the reason he hadn't was to keep Lu Guang's suspicions off him... Maybe he should have asked Xia Fei to have gotten him non-alcoholic beer instead?

There was a lot of things Cheng Xiaoshi wished he had done differently at this moment but time continued to pass; whether he was going to mess up or keep the timeline the same, it did not care for such things.

Cheng Xiaoshi's fists ball up as Xia Fei rises to his feet and the footballer on the television kicks the ball towards the goal. 

Everything had reduced to a snails pace and Cheng Xiaoshi couldn't help but feel like he was recording this moment on a recorder that only ran at 1732fps.

The shattering glass and the cries of defeat from the football hooligans.

The cheers from within the tv and the just barely audible tick tock from the clock hanging from the wall.

The careful taps on the table from Lu Guang.

It took everything in Cheng Xiaoshi to not stop his friend from letting out a cheer; ignoring how he could feel his nails begin to sink into the flesh of his palms.

To stick to the timeline, he had to do it.

And so, rather than enjoying his time with Lu Guang and Xia Fei, he was once again sprinting through the dark alleys of Bridon and feeling water soak into his shoes from the residual puddles that had formed earlier that day.

But, he kept on running.

Running and running until they reached a fork in the road.

Sparing a glance at Lu Guang, Cheng Xiaoshi allowed himself to trust his instincts just this once and took the right pathway and all it took was a well timed punch to knock out their 'secret' attacker.

The trio kept going until they were absolutely certain that they had shaken off the football hooligans and, even though he knew he shouldn't be feeling like this, it was worth it.

Cheng Xiaoshi had let Xia Fei cheer for that one team winning so it was only right that they got to escape... And, part of him was glad that he got to miss meeting Vein this timeline. He still had some mixed feelings when it came to Xia Fei's friend.

But, now wasn't the time for dwelling on the past!

It was time to celebrate this moment!

Spinning around to express his pure joy, Cheng Xiaoshi's eyes landed on Lu Guang. He took deep breaths and was more happy to share his excitement. All they needed to do was get back to their hotel and-

Lu Guang crumbles.

Luckily, he was able to catch the other before he could make contact with the solid ground.

Just in the nick of time.

But, it was as if a tidal wave had swept him under, adrenaline soaks through his entire body and, as if he had been struck by lightening, sends a shiver down his spine.

They'd successfully been able to escape from the football hooligans but... 

He should have prepared for this. 

Cheng Xiaoshi knew this was going to happen but that didn't ease the shaking of his hands as he clung onto the limp Lu Guang.

It didn't ease his erratic breathing.

It didn't stop his body from gulping mouthfuls of air as if he had been deprived of oxygen.

It didn't-

""Cheng Xiaoshi!"" A voice calls out to him, snapping him out of his panic and turning his attention to an old friend. All he could do was stare as Xia Fei knelt down and gently placed a hand on his shoulder; any sign that they had been intoxicated completely wiped clean and replaced with concern for the other. ""I need you to breath for me. Can you do that?""

Cheng Xiaoshi could only barely manage to nod his head before carefully mimicking everything Xia Fei did.

Breath in.

Breath out.

He felt the warmth of Lu Guang's skin press against his hands.

Breath in.

Breath out.

The rise and fall of his chest.

Breath in.

Breath out.

A flush of deep red that coated his cheeks and forehead.

In that moment, as he was able to compose himself, Cheng Xiaoshi made a promise.

When Lu Guang recovered, he was going to tell him everything.

1o15r3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1o15r3q/investigate_if_attitude_laundry_stain_remover/,Investigate if ATTITUDE Laundry Stain Remover Truly Works,"ATTITUDE 60257 has been an unexpected delight during my laundry experiences. I picked this plant-based stain remover because I wanted something effective yet gentle, especially for sensitive fabrics like baby clothes. My initial thought was that something so eco-friendly might lack the prowess to tackle tough stains, but let me assure you, this little bottle proved my assumptions wrong.

**Eco-Friendly Design That Stands Out**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the packaging. Housed in a bottle made of HDPE #2 plastic, which is among the easiest plastics to recycle, this product takes environmental consciousness seriously. It's not just about functionality; it‚Äôs ensuring sustainable living, which I deeply appreciate as someone trying to make small green changes. The pump nozzle on the bottle ensures even application without unnecessary waste. It's sleek, lightweight, and easy to store alongside other household supplies.

**Performance That Speaks for Itself**  
The performance surprised me the most, as I didn‚Äôt expect such an eco-friendly product to act so powerfully on stubborn stains. Whether it‚Äôs baby food mashed into onesies or accidental coffee spills on my blouse, this laundry stain remover just works. I usually spray a bit directly on the stain, let it sit for five to ten minutes, and toss the fabric into my regular wash. Even with just one treatment, the fabric emerges clean and spotless.

**Check ATTITUDE 60257 price on Amazon.**

**A Formula That Cares**  
Navigating parenting with a baby who has sensitive skin has made me very cautious about what products I use. This stain remover‚Äôs formula is dermatologically tested, unscented, and incredibly gentle. It‚Äôs free of harsh chemicals, yet efficient. Containing 98.8% naturally sourced ingredients, it‚Äôs infused with oats, which adds an extra layer of gentleness. Knowing I don't have to worry about allergic reactions or skin rashes from residual chemicals is such a relief.

**Highlights**  
- Made with 98.8% naturally sourced ingredients  
- Dermatologically tested for daily use on sensitive fabrics  
- Unscented formula perfect for those avoiding fragrances  
- HDPE #2 plastic bottle for easy recycling  
- PETA certified as 100% vegan and cruelty-free  

**Shortcomings**  
While ATTITUDE 60257 excels in tackling fresh stains, I noticed it‚Äôs less effective on old, set-in ones. Here‚Äôs what could use improvement:  
- Limited efficacy on older, tougher stains.  
- May require a second treatment, especially for fabrics like denim or heavy cotton.  

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing it with traditional stain removers like Resolve or OxiClean, it might lack some of the aggressive chemical punch that deeply embedded stains often require. However, ATTITUDE wins hands-down in terms of being a safe, non-toxic, and environmentally conscious alternative. It‚Äôs in a league of its own for parents, eco-enthusiasts, and anyone with sensitive skin.

**True Value**  
With so many laundry products out there, ATTITUDE 60257 strikes a balance between affordability and quality. While it may not be the cheapest option on the market, the peace of mind it offers with its natural and baby-safe formula makes it worth every penny. Choosing this stain remover is not just purchasing another household product ‚Äì it‚Äôs investing in a safer, cleaner, and greener routine for your family.

1o15r3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o15r3f/nc700_vs_quietcomfort_ultra_2nd_gen/,NC700 vs QuietComfort Ultra 2nd Gen,"I recently upgraded from my NC700 headphones (which I used daily for 5 years) to the QC Ultra 2nd Gen, primarily for two reasons: I was frustrated by not being able to use the microphone when the battery died, and I hoped for better audio quality during calls - both were significant weaknesses of the NC700.

I upgraded about 2 weeks ago and got the QC Ultra 2nd Gen early (they were available in Romania before the official release date for some reason).

While the audio quality is definitely better than the NC700, I'm disappointed with the active noise cancellation - it feels like a downgrade. I regularly work and take calls in coffee shops, and the NC700 effectively blocked out all voices and background noise unless someone was directly in front of me (even then, only about 20% would come through).

With the QC Ultra 2nd Gen, significantly more voices and ambient noise leak through. When someone is in front of me, people on the call can clearly hear their entire voice, which is really frustrating. And also extra noise goes through the first few seconds when I start speaking.

Has anyone else experienced this? Was the NC700 actually better at blocking voices and ambient noise, or is there something wrong with my unit? Is there a fix, and is Bose aware of this issue? It seems hard to believe that my 5-year-old headphones outperform the new model in this crucial area.",1,1759915568.0,bose,0,1.0,False

1o15q3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/derealization/comments/1o15q3i/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/,How do I get out of this?,"It all started about 8 months ago, right after my 10th grade board exams. It started off really midly and I thought that the reason I (17f) was feeling so tired and out of it all of the time was because of the stress and pressure that came with my first board examinations. I had a history of insomnia (mostly anxiety induced), which came on a result of poor sleep hygiene, having coffee too late and of course, anxiety. I was constantly stressed out about my social life and mostly about my academics since I usually put the pressure on myself to maintain my A stars. I had been struggling with insomnia for about 2 years at that point and only started recovering during my board exams since I felt well prepared to write my exams. So naturally, I assumed that I was just exhausted from all of that and decided to just give myself time to rest and recover. But it only got worse from there and the dreamlike state that I was feeling like I was in was persistently getting worse for 3 months. I didn't tell anybody about it, but people started noticing that I was just always run down and tired. My mom constantly said that it looked like I was just crying even if I wasn't and my eyes were droopy and tired. I didn't know what to do. When school started again, it just got so so bad to the point where I would have to excuse myself from group settings because I didn't do well with loud noises, and classrooms can get reslly loud really quick, and then I would just cry in the bathroom terrified. It got to the point where I had to pinch myself in class to focus and I couldn't convince myself that I was a real human being. People's voices would get kinda weird and distorted when people spoke to me and I would be sleeping constantly. I finally told my mom because I was feeling extremely depressed and scared and I didn't know what to do. She put me in therapy and it kind of helped, but not really. Eventually I kinda learned to live with it and we actually went in for blood tests and we met my doctor just to see if it was something physically wrong with me or not. I started having iron tablets  at the recommendation of my doctor even though the blood reports were normal and I actually started feeling better. Idk if it was like a placebo or if it actually helped but I felt better. But now, I'm starting to feel that exhaustion again, my mom's seeing that same look on my face and I constantly feel disconnected from my surroundings again even though ive regularly been having my tablets. I don't really know what to do now and I don't know wbat else to try because I don't wanna go back to where I was. That was the lowest point of my life and I'm reaching out for help in case any of you know or have been through something similar I would really appreciate the help. No one really believed me when I tried to explain to them the state I was in and no one really got what I meant when I said that I felt like I was in a dream all the time and sometimes it made me reslly dizzy and scared. 

I'm sorry this post is so long but I would really appreciate any advice from any of you

*For context - It's a free and much better alternative to Calendly and Cal Com.*  
  
I thought a fresh UI would retain more users and, of course, better growth‚Ä¶ NOPE!

Here‚Äôs what went wrong:

* I chased too many cool features ‚Üí The UI got bloated, looked like a dashboard for a spaceship.
* Friends wanted more colors, then fewer colors, then ‚Äúcan you make the button shake?‚Äù **Never listen to friends, listen to users!**
* Didn‚Äôt focus on Mobile view from the start, my design concept looked and worked great but at one point I had to change it completely, even on desktop, just because it wasn‚Äôt even remotely possible on phone.
* At least I resisted putting a chat bubble in the corner (you‚Äôre welcome), but I still did at the end.  

But these are just a few mistakes, could happen to anyone.

1o15pzs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o15pzs,My Guangzhou Trip Experience (Kinbo & Baiyun Markets) ‚Äî September 2025,"I recently returned from a week-long trip to Guangzhou (23rd‚Äì30th September), and I wanted to share my experience visiting two of the main markets ‚Äî Kinbo Market and Baiyun Leather City Center. The trip was primarily for exploring suppliers, understanding the ecosystem, and making long-term business connections.


---

Kinbo Market

Kinbo is a massive multi-floor market that offers almost everything ‚Äî from accessories to apparel to bags.
The 7th floor is the highlight. It‚Äôs where most wholesalers operate, and the products are noticeably higher-end in both quality and finishing.

Each vendor specializes in certain categories ‚Äî for instance, some only deal in Loro Piana, others focus on shoes, Moncler jackets, Burberry items, etc. Prices and quality vary significantly between shops, so spending time exploring and comparing is essential before finalizing anything.


---

Baiyun Leather City Center

Baiyun primarily caters to bags, and it‚Äôs one of the most impressive markets I‚Äôve visited. Many showrooms are designed to resemble official brand stores, and it‚Äôs easy to forget you‚Äôre not in one.
They often display leather options for customization (especially for Hermes-style bags), allowing you to choose specific materials and finishes.

Most shops don‚Äôt keep ready stock ‚Äî they display samples. You select what you want or show them a reference photo, make the payment, and they deliver the items to your hotel later.

Finding a reliable seller here can be challenging, but I managed to locate a few excellent vendors. I now have verified contacts for bags, shoes, and accessories. I also came across several watch sellers, but even after inspecting the pieces myself, I decided not to buy due to price inconsistencies and doubts regarding authenticity.


---

Caution & Tips

Be cautious of people on the streets offering ‚Äúhigh copy‚Äù items. They usually lead you to small, hidden stores with inflated prices and poor quality.

Stick to reputable market vendors or contacts you‚Äôve verified through trusted sources.

Outside every major market, you‚Äôll find numerous cargo offices that handle packing, shipping, and even customs clearance ‚Äî very convenient if you‚Äôre purchasing in bulk.



---

What I Purchased

I purchased approximately 15 bags, 20 pairs of shoes, 15 belts, and various pieces of clothing.
As I also deal in kidswear, I explored potential suppliers for that segment as well and found some promising leads. I used an existing women‚Äôs clothing vendor for a few additional orders since their price and quality were already tested.


---

Travel & Experience

Immigration at the airport was slightly strict. They asked for my return flight details, hotel booking confirmations, purpose of visit, and how much cash I was carrying.

Hospitality was excellent. Many sellers offered snacks, drinks, and even dinner invitations.

Vegetarian food options were limited. My vegetarian friend found it difficult to manage and mostly relied on coffee, fruit juices, and basic pizza.



---

Final Thoughts

Overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied with the trip. The professionalism, organization, and efficiency I observed in Guangzhou were impressive. The way they conduct business ‚Äî from market structure to vendor-client relationships ‚Äî is something worth experiencing firsthand.

Even if you‚Äôre not directly involved in the replica or sourcing business, visiting China once to see how they operate can genuinely change your perspective.
I plan to visit again in January for further business development.

Got the GB out, felt great for about 3 months, then I had an UTI, the gp couldn't diagnose it (NHS..) so I ended up going private and seeing an urologist, UTI took 6 months total to get rid of it, 3 one week rounds, and 3 months of low dose antibiotics. I still get that burning feeling a few times a month and now just treat it myself with these cystitis sachets (if in the US think AZO in powder form), and drink a lot of water.

I'm almost two years out from surgery and I'm steadily finding things that I can no longer have without running to the bathroom 5-20 min after. Mostly drinks, and I love my drinks.  Coffee (unless I grind it fresh at home each time), milk/cream, cold water, anything with sucralose. I'm limiting fatty meals (I do still have some, I wanna live a little) 

The stomach cramps when I find a new thing I can't have are awful. I'm pretty sure I have IBS as well. 

I don't really have a safe food, so if I'm going out anywhere I usually don't eat (that panic of being in a taxi in traffic and the stomach cramps start, I have an anxiety disorder that doesn't help.) Sometimes I'll brave a banana or a granola bar (certain ones) before going out and it's a 50/50 chance that stomach cramps start up.

Then some days I'm just fine, and it's like I don't have any problems.

I have been to my GP who said ""watch what you eat""....like I don't already.


The anxiety of not knowing if something is going to get me when I'm away from home is daunting.

I also have a dare devil toddler, so spending a lot of time in the bathroom is NOT great.

1o15nxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o15nxr/explore_if_simpure_ctof10b5_carbon_water_filter/,Explore if SimPure CTO-F10B-5 carbon water filter delivers powerful filtration review!,"The SimPure CTO-F10B-5 Carbon Water Filter, a product I started testing out a few months ago, quickly became an unexpected center of attention in my household. The conversations initially ranged from my family poking fun at my sudden obsession with a water filter to curiosity about my review process. From its impressive material quality to its minor quirks, I‚Äôve taken the time to scrutinize every little aspect. Here's the experience I had with this whole-house water filter.

**Design and Build Quality**

Straight out of the box, the sturdy coconut shell activated carbon block and the dual food-grade non-woven fabric layers stood out. This thing feels solid. I‚Äôm no structural engineer, but the materials scream durability and safety. The inclusion of food-grade materials provides an extra level of reassurance that the water my family is drinking is purified without contamination from poorly constructed components. Unlike generic filters that may feel flimsy, this product has repeatedly stood strong during installation and replacement cycles. On the physical design front, it‚Äôs not breaking design barriers, but it fits well and is secure within the household water filtration system.

**Easy Setup for a Less-Than-Handy Person**

Being somewhat clumsy with tools, I anticipated setup to be daunting. Surprisingly, the universal 10-inch size and flexibility with various water purifier models like the SimPure DB10P and GE GXWH35F made compatibility a breeze. Installation was straightforward, even for someone like me who avoids plumbing. I followed the instructions, screwed things into place, and voila‚Äîit was up and running in less than an hour. I didn‚Äôt encounter any awkward sizing issues that other filters sometimes bring. Ensuring its universal compatibility is what I‚Äôd call a thoughtful touch for households with diverse filtration systems.

**Positives**

- Engineered with high-quality coconut shell activated carbon for superior filtration.
- Filters out 98% of residual chlorine, sulfur taste, and unpleasant odors.
- Simplified universal compatibility saves you the headache of hunting for niche model matches.
- Long-lasting potential, up to 15,000 gallons or roughly 3‚Äì6 months of use.
- Built tough yet with food-safe material build.

[Check SimPure CTO-F10B-5 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07qtgzym9/)

**Performance in Everyday Use**

Over the weeks, I‚Äôve put this water filter to the test with various sources: municipal water, rainwater, and even well water during a long weekend at a friend's countryside property. This unit didn‚Äôt miss a beat, delivering clean water without odd tastes or smells. Over time, I noticed an absence of mineral buildup around faucets‚Äîsomething that used to drive me nuts. For those relying on filtered water for brewing coffee (yes, that‚Äôs me), you might detect a marked improvement in water purity. The 5-micron rating does an admirable job balancing effective filtration with strong water flow. My appliances, especially the coffee maker and laundry machine, seem happier too. Strong water pressure remained constant, showing no signs of a frustrating slowdown.

**Negatives**

- The 5.3-pound weight, while indicative of decent build quality, can occasionally make replacement a bit of a workout.
- It‚Äôs slightly bulkier compared to competitors; fitting it into tighter filtration units might need extra effort.
- Limited notifications or indicators for when to replace the filter‚Äîmanual reminders are necessary.

**Product Rivals**

I spent some time comparing this water filter to common alternatives like the Culligan RFC-BB and GE FXHTC filters. Those options do capture a fairly loyal fan base, but they fall short in consistent filtration for taste and odor improvement. For instance, the Culligan filter didn‚Äôt seem to handle sulfuric smells as effectively in my initial tests, while some alternatives like the GE filter occasionally disappointed with lower water pressure over time. One thing that sets the SimPure apart is the massive compatibility across units; not all competitors can offer versatility as widely as this one. Though slightly heavier and bulkier, its tradeoff lies in stronger functionality and better long-term performance.

**Value Proposition**

Having used some rather disappointing filters in the past, this unit feels like it earns its keep. You‚Äôre investing in better water purity, noticeable taste enhancements, and reduced appliance wear‚Äîall of which add up in savings and health benefits. While it isn‚Äôt the absolute cheapest option, it‚Äôs definitely poised to provide strong value for its cost. Spending extra for something as essential as water quality feels smarter and well-justified with a product that walks its talk.

1o15n42,https://i.redd.it/dcfidrrzsutf1.png,Looking for technical partners for a side project.,"**Project Background:**

I‚Äôm building a membership management web app for a non-profit martial arts dojo in Southern California. The app is purely for internal use ‚Äî to manage members and track membership fees. It will not generate any profit and is simply a collaborative project meant to provide everyone involved with real-world experience and a strong addition to their portfolio/resum√©.

I‚Äôve already conducted user interviews with the dojo‚Äôs administrators, gathered the main requirements, and designed about 80% of the prototype in Figma.

**Why This Project:**

I studied Mathematics and Economics at UC Irvine (UCI) and earned my Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics at USC. After starting my career, I discovered a strong interest in Product Management and want to strengthen my background through real projects.

As a dojo member for 9 years, I noticed their membership management relies heavily on manual processes, and membership fees come from multiple payment channels, making data tracking challenging for the admin team. That‚Äôs what inspired this project.

I previously collaborated with a UCI CS graduate on this app, and I‚Äôm proud that it helped him land a great job. However, he‚Äôs now busy with full-time work, so I‚Äôm looking for more engineers to help bring this project to completion and make it a real product.

**Who am I looking for:**

Passionate computer science major college students (Junior/Senior/Graduate)

UI/UX major also welcome!

If you‚Äôre graduated professional and also interested in this project, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out too!

**My Role:**

I‚Äôll act as the Product Manager, responsible for:

    ‚Ä¢	Defining the product direction and MVP
    
    ‚Ä¢	Designing the Figma prototype
    
    ‚Ä¢	Communicating with real users and gathering feedback
    
    ‚Ä¢	Handling user onboarding when the product is ready

**Your Role:**

I‚Äôm looking for full-stack engineers to build the frontend and backend of the web app. You‚Äôre also welcome (and encouraged!) to share ideas on features or design improvements.

    ‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre a UCI or USC student, we can meet in person weekly over coffee or food to discuss progress and next steps.
    
    ‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre from another school or state, that‚Äôs fine too ‚Äî we can collaborate through weekly online meetings.

**Goal:**

I hope this project gives everyone involved valuable hands-on experience, stronger portfolios, and better career opportunities. And most importantly, meet new friends and have fun working together!

I already use noise cancelling headphones in the office, but it takes so little to change my focus and there goes my task. How do you deal with it? I switched from coffee to green tea, especially in the mornings it seems to be much better. 

Also a couple years ago I discovered binaural beats, which I play for hours while working. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but I haven't really figured out why. I even made an app for myself where I can define different frequencies and set a timer, because I got so bored of all the YouTube videos. I try to put my work phases in 20 minutes pieces with a 5 minute break in-between. It really got better over the years, but at this point I'm not sure if the binaural audio actually works or if I'm just used to my work structure.   
I use beta waves for concentration and delta waves for sleep, does anyone have experience with that?

You got caught in a heavy rain as you were walking back to your apartment and unfortunately, flood slowly rises. You found a cafe nearby and decided to stay in there until the flood has receded.  
  
Upon entering, you've learned that they were already closing. And the lone closing staff might be the last person you want to see in cozy set up.





(Rain starts pouring)

¬†

Ah, shit. This rain‚Äôs pretty hard.

¬†

Oops, it looks like it has already flooded this way. Uhmm‚Ä¶ what do we do? Think, think, think I‚Äôm getting wet‚Ä¶

¬†

Oh look, the caf√© nearby is open. Thank the universe it‚Äôs open‚Ä¶

¬†

(Door bell rings)

¬†

I‚Äôm sorry?

¬†

Oh, you‚Äôre closed! -I-I‚Äôm really sorry I won‚Äôt buy anything though but do you mind if I stay in here for a bit? The way to my apartment got flooded and I don‚Äôt have any other way. And I‚Äôm already soaked, so if you don‚Äôt mind, can I stay here?

¬†

Oh, thank you. Thank you, really.

¬†

Yeah, the flood out there is bad. It got my shoes soaked. The flood rises so quickly, it doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs raining hard.

¬†

Ooh, I smell coffee\~ I thought you‚Äôre already closing (laugh) but I didn‚Äôt buy any coffee though

¬†

It‚Äôs on the house? Oh, uhm, you don‚Äôt have to (laughs shyly)

¬†

Thank you-

¬†

Oh. It‚Äôs you‚Ä¶

¬†

Uhm, (laughs awkwardly) I didn‚Äôt know you work here‚Ä¶ I was about to go back to my apartment when I got caught in the rain‚Ä¶

¬†

Yeah, of course I told you that already, sorry.

¬†

‚Ä¶

¬†

So, uhm... Is this what you're up to lately? Do you have other things going on aside from working in this little dainty cafe?

¬†

You think I'm acting weird? How can you say so?

¬†

Well I mean, obviously, I just met up with my ex and it just so happens that we got stranded together in a cafe... Alone...

¬†

I mean, I (sigh)...

¬†

We did end in good terms... But did we though? I‚ÄîI feel like there's still something left between us and it doesn't help that you're my first ex that I saw after we broke up. All of my relationships before, every time we broke up, whether we ended on good terms or not, I would never see them again, even if we live 30 minutes away from each other....

¬†

And my heart... You and both know that I believe that everything I've lost, if I see them again, if I found them again, it's destined to fate that it will be mine

¬†

We may ended in good terms but... There's still a bit of love for you left in me that has nowhere to go. I tried to do volunteering, go to a pottery class, take myself to a concert... But none of them felt the relief the way I'd give my love to you...

¬†

You made me feel... Different, you made me saw things in life that I've never seen before. And when you left, it was like I could never be in that world again. You bring the joy in this world, sweetheart. You're that dear to me...

¬†

Of course, I love you that much. Did I not say it enough to you?

¬†

You're the best that I have, I cherish you in every way that I can. I mean, look at you... Not to brag but I definitely took care of you very well

¬†

(Laugh) Oh yes, I should definitely take the credit. Why shouldn't I?

¬†

Come on, give me a justifiable reason why I shouldn't take credit for taking care of you...

¬†

Couldn't think of a good reason, huh? That's because I should definitely take the credit

¬†

There wasn't a time I remember when I'm alone, every moment that I spent, I spent it with you‚Ä¶

¬†

No, I did not spend every minute of my day missing you, I have other things I have to do and‚Äîmaybe, maybe I did. It just didn‚Äôt occur to me that I was actually missing you cause you‚Äôre not here anymore‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always thought about you whenever you‚Äôre at work and missing you whenever I got home first. Like, all I ever knew was you‚Ä¶

¬†

Our break up was never really‚Ä¶ proper. We just drifted apart and one day you just texted me ‚Äòdo we still need to keep doing this?‚Äô and‚Ä¶ maybe I just didn‚Äôt get the message you were really trying to say but with the way we were back then, I thought it would be better to end it.

¬†

We were hurting, sweetheart‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt know how to fix us (sniff)

¬†

Yes! I missed you, God knows how much I missed you when I spent all my days thinking about you, doing my routine as if you‚Äôre coming home to me, the way I wait for you would make me believe that you‚Äôll come back to me anytime soon. And I‚Äôd never expect that we‚Äôd end up meeting again like this. Just the two of us

¬†

Maybe the fate misses us too

¬†

And I‚Äôm so sorry for missing of what you were trying to say over that text. We went something similar before and we‚Äôd always get back on our feet. I still have no idea why I just let you go like that.

¬†

I don‚Äôt know if this is wrong to ask but, where do you want to go after this?

¬†

I know it‚Äôs stupid to ask after what I have done to you, what both of us went through, but I think it‚Äôs worth trying again‚Ä¶ but only if you want to

¬†

You don‚Äôt have to answer me right away, you don‚Äôt have to decide now, but I‚Äôd like to know if you had ever thought about us‚Ä¶ again

¬†

(Deep breath) this coffee‚Ä¶ it smells like the way you used to make. Is this your specialty?

¬†

Oh‚Ä¶ so you made it just for me‚Ä¶ the way I always liked‚Ä¶

¬†

Did this become your habit? Or did you just make this for me out of instinct? After all, you always greet me with a drink whenever I came home.

¬†

And if this is your way of answering my question ‚Äî if you still think about me ‚Äî then I‚Äôll take that as a yes.

1o159vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o159vm/lumps_keep_appearing_for_no_reason_on_my_neck_and/,"Lumps keep appearing for no reason on my neck And im left with no diagnosis, PLEASE HELP????","
About four months ago, I noticed something weird while looking in the mirror ‚Äî a small, hard lump on the right side of my neck. It felt like a stiff golf ball just under the skin. No pain at the time, I wasn‚Äôt sick, didn‚Äôt have a cold, no recent infections. Just... there. Staring back at me.

At first, I told myself it was probably a swollen lymph node and tried to brush it off. But something about it felt off. It wasn‚Äôt soft or tender like you'd expect with an infection. It was hard and unmoving. Still, I waited. Thought maybe it would go away.

It didn‚Äôt.

In fact, things only got worse.

More lumps started showing up. Two popped up near my collarbone on each side. Then another under my jawline, but this time on the opposite side. They're all the same just diffrent sizes: round, stiff, hard ‚Äî almost like someone slipped medium to large marbles under my skin. And they hurt. Not really on the surface, but deep inside, like a dull throb mixed with sharp, nerve-like stings that fade away.

Even weirder, when a new lump shows up, I get these random, sharp aches on the same side of my body. Like if it‚Äôs a lump on the left side, I‚Äôll start getting jolts or muscle aches on the left side too. It‚Äôs like something is messing with my nervous system.

But it‚Äôs not just the lumps.

I‚Äôve been feeling off in every way. Exhausted to the point of barely functioning some days. Lightheaded. Random moments where I feel like I can‚Äôt get enough air, even though I‚Äôm just sitting still. My heart races sometimes after doing nothing. I used to love coffee, but now even half a cup gives me chest pain and shakes like I‚Äôm going into panic mode. My body feels hypersensitive to everything ‚Äî like it's stuck in overdrive. Appetite swings like crazy, and I get these odd body tremors randomly throughout the day.

I finally went to the doctor a couple months ago. He asked if I had a history with drugs (I don‚Äôt ‚Äî never touched anything and don‚Äôt plan to). He ordered an ultrasound and ran blood tests. One thing came back abnormal ‚Äî something with a high count, but it was a word I didn‚Äôt recognize and honestly, I was too overwhelmed at the time to ask for clarification. I plan to follow up, but he straight-up told me: ""I‚Äôm not really sure what this is.""

That line hasn‚Äôt left my head since.

The lumps are still spreading. I'm scared I‚Äôll wake up one day and there will be more in places I can‚Äôt see or feel. I don‚Äôt know if this is cancer, some rare autoimmune thing, or something even worse. I'm trying not to spiral but the unknown is terrifying, especially when your body is telling you something is wrong and no one can give you answers.

I‚Äôm 19. I weigh about 180 lbs and I‚Äôm 5'4"" ‚Äî not super athletic, but I‚Äôve never dealt with anything even close to this. I‚Äôve been healthy all my life. This came out of nowhere.

If anyone has experienced something similar ‚Äî or knows someone who has ‚Äî I‚Äôd be insanely grateful to hear your thoughts. At this point I just want to know I‚Äôm not alone‚Ä¶ or at least get pointed in the right direction.

I am a 30 year old female and I just recently moved into a complex with my kids. I split from their dad a few months ago. When I moved in, I struggled to mount my TV on the wall, so I called the chairperson of the body corperate if he could assist me. He said yes and came over to help. He noticed that my dishwasher was leaking and offered to fix that too. He is a helpful guy. Over the next few weeks he helped me with a few things around the house and we formed a friendship.

Now onto his wife. She's a nice woman, but her personality is the polar opposite of mine. She's introverted and keeps to herself, she doesn't go out at all, except with my friend. She goes to work, and comes home. That's all. They also just had a baby a few months ago. So keeping that in mind, I get along with her husband more than her. 

Her husband works from home and I'm a teacher. Schools were closed so ever now and then, I would go by their place and have a cup of coffee with my friend, usually after I've been to the gym. Things were fine, when one day my friend came to my unit and said that I must stop visiting so much, that his wife is uncomfortable that I am always there but only when she is at work. Like really?? They have cameras in the house so it wasn't like I was going behind her back. She texted me to say that as a woman, I should've recognized when the visits became too much, and that it was inappropriate to constantly visit a married man wearing tight and skimpy workout clothes. I told her she needs to stop being insecure and that she must let her husband be friends with other women. That because they are having marital issues is on her because her husband is loyal and she must stop trying to control him. She called me an attention-seeking narcissist and blocked me. My friend also refuses to talk to me now.

Was I the asshole for how I handled the situation?",0,1759913569.0,AmItheAsshole,31,0.27,False

1o157v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1o157v8/sp_and_our_long_thing/,SP and our long thing.,"I have known my SP for just over a year at work now. I am in my early 30s and she's in her late 20s. We both bonded over our similar situations as her partner broke up with her, and so did mine a few months later. We have had many shifts at work together and throughout the year have made many attempts to work together when we can (swapping with others so we can work together from her end and my end). In March we planned to get coffee and meet up outside of work but her ex came back and unfortunately they have been dating again (and still presumably are). However when we do work together we are still close, flirty, always making each other laugh and just in general having a vibe, we even fall asleep next to each other on long nights. We both have back and forth invited each other for coffee over and over in the past 6 months, however it's never happened and neither of us follow through. You can tell in person that there is a weird eye contact / tension between us (around others) but nothing has ever been said out loud between us. We just saw each other for the first time in a while the other day and she said that we should catch up for coffee again as she was leaving and we are both off this week. Since she said it, I wanna leave it for her to actually follow through so I dont look like I'm chasing.

I really want to believe in law of assumption/attraction but it's so hard, even though we keep getting drawn back in and I am seeing her name literally everywhere.

From a LOA perspective, how would you guys handle this situation? I would love something to happen with her but almost want her to actually go ahead and make the first move because she's with her ex still as far as I know and I would feel weird making a move myself in that situation (I am also shy). If she does make a move then I can take it as our connection meaning more to her and go from there.

Just wish it would happen already. I have never had this weird tension with someone before but also this fun/flirty/constant laughter thing. It's really nice. Also we both only act like this when we are alone together, around others we both get shy and don't talk much. It's night and day.

Yes, naa koy friend since college pami super suod kaau mi. Mag kasinabot mi sa mga gagmay og dagko na mga butang og parehas sad mi nga single. Ga share mi sa mga kinsay mga naka chat namo. Hilig mi mag watson, mag coffee date and mang ukay. Naabot ang time na dili na kaau  mi mag-uban paghuman na sa klase then graduate napod. dili na kaau mi gakita everyday kay naa nay tagsa tagsang mga work. and still ako single ghpon.

Naa koy nakita na video reels na ang nakabutang ato ""Galing kayo nag Inn pero hindi ka hinatid kaya naglakad ka nalang pauwi"" yang yung nakalagay na context. Nagkatawa kog maau kay mao jud na nga situation sa akoang amega ato nga time like reality mn kaau. So akoa gisend sa iyaha ana pako nga ""Tan-awa gani ikaw jud ni ba kahinumdom pajud ka"" then BOOOOOOOM

1o152ky,https://v.redd.it/bo01aqueoutf1,Normcore 58mm to 49mm Step-down basket review,"I have now had the step-down basket over a week and I can say, I really like it.

Kit comes with a puck screen, spring, magnetic dosing funnel and 200 filter papers.

It‚Äôs really forgiving and it allows me to grind a lot coarser. I have Rocket Faustino as a grinder and with my current beans  Moonsooned Malabar using 1:2 recipe 18g beans and 36g out in 24 sec. There is a lot more crema, because of the coarser grind setting and it was really easy to find the sweet spot.

So the positives:

- very forgiving, easier for the grinder thanks to the coarser grind size.

- no chaneling

- more crema
- easy to dial in
- definitely brings more notes in the cup. More sweetness and clarity.

The negatives:

- You need to use the included puck screen and the spring. Otherwise you have a messy soup.

- 49mm tamper needed

- puck prep takes longer and can be s bit annoying

Conclusion:

Before this basket I used  pedantory Coffee Lab high extraction Cylin Pro L basket, so this is my comparison.

For me the easiness of dialing in and forgiveness are the win. It brings more sweetness, clarity and crema.

So if the puck prep does not bother you I highly recommend this set.

We dated for a year and then she broke up with me in august 2024, and it happened after I got a year back in college, so I decided to travel for the year as I didn‚Äôt wanted to live in the city, so now that I am back to college, we started talking again, and I always try to be there for her whenever she asks me to, because I honestly don‚Äôt care about what relations is there between her and me, I always cared for her and I will, and she too cares for me from what I have felt, so at first we both were kind of awkward with each other but then as we kept on meeting the awkwardness went away, and then last week she called me while she was drunk and I went to see her, at first she tried to kiss me but I said no as I knew she drunk and it would come back on me only, then she got mad at me and told me that she‚Äôs over me and, doesn‚Äôt even like me anymore and, that I should stop being nice and considerate to her, I said, I can‚Äôt do it, and that I don‚Äôt care about what happened between us, you still matter to me, then she told me when last year I wasn‚Äôt here, she tried to date some other guy and it didn‚Äôt worked out between them, she told me about him in a way that would provoke me and that she did it to move on but ended up realising that she can‚Äôt, then I consoled her and we both talked for some time and then I went back home, I did had tears in my eyes when I got back but I think that‚Äôs something that I should with, and I don‚Äôt want her to know it, so then we met again after that night, we went out for coffee, while returning back she held me and made out with me, now I don‚Äôt know what to say I too was a equal part of it, I dropped her off and went home she called me and told me that she didn‚Äôt regret what had happened and she wanted to do it, and then she told me about her conditions, like what she wants, and I agreed to them all, and through out the night we flirted she even sent me her nudes even tho I didn‚Äôt asked for it, after that day we had exams, so for 3 days we both barely talked, I didn‚Äôt bothered her much as I knew exams are going and I don‚Äôt want to do anything to distract her, but last night I went to see her, to talk about everything that‚Äôs been going on, and she told me that I misinterpreted things, what happened wasn‚Äôt meaningless, but at the same time she can‚Äôt date me, as I am a nice guy overall, but at the same time my life is not at all stable and she wants a stable future, which she do not see with me. I told her that I can make changes in myself if that‚Äôs what you want, but she said no, She can‚Äôt date me, then she said that I might have everything but I don‚Äôt have what she wants, in the end I told her that I still have feelings for her, and for me it‚Äôs gonna be the same in the future too, now it‚Äôs on you how you interpret it, I have made myself clear.

1o14vub,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1o14vub/white_knight_of_the_grocery_store_1_the_gallagher/,White Knight of the Grocery Store 1 - The Gallagher Moment,"Alright, so this all happened to me about 3 months ago. It was a battle for the soul of a grocery store that didn't give a damn about itself. I like the store, unfortunately they don't give enough of a shit to avoid hiring people like... him. You'll meet him shortly. Just let me enjoy a bit of preamble, if I may... So, I was doing normal human things and trying to buy normal human groceries like a normal human woman. I did not intend to become the princess of the produce aisle, but the role was thrust upon me for no reason in particular other than the fact that I was shopping by myself. There will be at least 2 or 3 parts as of now... Try to keep up.

It was in one of those old mom and pop grocery stores by my house. The lights hum and flicker like dying fireflies and everything smells faintly like wet cardboard. Half the products are sitting there in the container they were shipping in. It's hopelessly lazy but also tremendously real. They also have steeper discounts for the almost-expired perishables. I do still work at a daycare, so my budget has to stretch.

I do know the layout by heart. Dairy on the left, meats way in the back, and a horrifying eldritch corridor where they keep all the canned fish to serve their eternal punishment. There's also always this old man muttering to himself in the bread aisle, and a listless employee who is pretending to organize the ketchup for 8 hours a day. It's entertaining in the exact opposite way of actual entertainment if that makes sense...

I presumed it'd be a quick trip. I had my headphones in, a list deathgripped in my hand, and zero desire to talk to anyone. My mission: milk, fruit, coffee, maybe a new razor, then escape. I was going to be skirting the outer limits of the store as much as possible. My route meant I didn't need to cruise down any aisles and overspend.

I‚Äôm minding my business, 'testing' a cantaloupe (because I saw someone do that once), when I hear this ultra-wet wretching cough behind me... It sounded like someone gargling a frog. That is not the hollow thump that I was looking for. That's a sound straight out of the deepest pits of hell... It would serve as the herald to signify the start of my greatest battle yet. (I might break into an anime fight sequence if the mood strikes, just know in advance that that part didn't actually happen.)

It spoke while I had my headphones in, so I just raised an eyebrow. It repeated itself... Finally I paused my music and said sharply ""what?""

‚ÄúI said uhhh do you... need a hand with that, m‚Äôlady?‚Äù he mumbled. I winced.

Before me stands a guy in a green apron and a name tag that says ‚ÄúDEREK üçå‚Äù I had to go paste the banana emoji here. I wish I was joking about the banana emoji. A thought flickered through my head about when the Banana emoji made its appearance. He looked at his name tag after 2 weeks on the job and said ""You know what this name tag needs? A phallic fruit.""   
  
The beast stood before me was fat, but not so fat that it couldn't fit through the aisles. Overweight instead of our usual morbidly obese subjects. It's face featured a thick, patchy beard. Something yellow was smeared in the corner of his mouth. I think it was mustard. I zoned out looking at it like when Walter White got his cancer diagnosis... I was trying not to judge him too quickly, until I caught a whiff of him. It was like someone who didn't give a single damn had spritzed Febreeze over a pile of hot ripe laundry. There was a lingering scent of armpits mingled with ball-cheese that snapped me out of my mustard-staring stupor and I spasmed into the display of melons behind me,

Somewhere behind me, a stack of limes cascaded to the floor. I heard a child point and say ‚Äúmommy she broke it!‚Äù

Regaining my composure, I laugh awkwardly and say, ‚ÄúNo thanks, I got it.‚Äù I thought about telling him about the mustard... But I didn't want to extend the interaction for any longer than I had to. I tried to wave him off and continue with my shopping. But Derek is standing directly in front of me with one hand settles on the cart. Derek is clearly refusing to pick up the signal that I'd like him to move.

I wiggled my cart, but he continued to hover. You know how vultures circle a carcass, waiting to see if it twitches? Yeah, it was like that, but with worse posture. He kept his hand on my cart as he whispered conspiratorially ""Uhh those pears are umm... Those are imported pears."" I blinked at him. Unsure of what that meant or where he was going with it. ""We got local ones in the back. Way juicier. I can, uh... fetch you a couple."" he continued.

""Oh no... I'm really okay. I like my fruit to be well-travelled."" I say as I roll my eyes.

He chuckles at that, but it‚Äôs not a normal laugh. It‚Äôs the kind of giggle that sounds like it hasn‚Äôt seen sunlight in years. The kind of laugh that is deeply laced with a sort of sick desperation. It almost sounds he's about to start crying. I don't return his laughter. Then he just‚Ä¶ stands there. Breathing. Existing at me. I can hear the faint wheeze through his nose like an asthmatic kettle.

It feels like the most awkward Mexican standoff in existence. I just blink at him again, which I guess is what prompts him to grab a produce bag.

He licks his thumb and begins to open the bag with the usual grocery store ritual. Lick, rub, separate. I watch in abject horror. The sound alone made me want to jab my eardrums with a couple of toothpicks.

‚ÄúErrmmm... here you go...‚Äù he says, like he‚Äôs doing me some grand favor, and hands me the moist plastic bag. Moist. From him. I wish I was exaggerating. I wanted to scream. Instead, I said ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù the same way you thank a dog for dropping a dead bird at your feet.

I push past him and the wet plastic bag and try to continue my trip, and to my dismay he starts to follow. Like we're shopping together now. He waddles behind like he just pinched a loaf into his khakis, settling his hand on my cart every time I stop for an item... I tried a variety of grocery store evasive maneuvers. Sharp left into the spice aisle, fake a fascination with the yogurt section, try to distract him with Oreos. He just kept on reappearing like a Walmart-brand cryptid. I couldn't shake him. Nothing seemed to work. I was about to head the the cleaning aisle and splash bleach into his eyes so I could make a break for it, but then I realized that my list was complete... But I did need to loop back to produce since I had fled without the fruit previously.

He pops up again as I walk, like clockwork, and tries to flex his 'insider' knowledge. ‚ÄúYou know, if you get the milk from the back, it lasts longer.‚Äù Oh wow. Yeah, Derek, thank you so much. I‚Äôve been on this planet for thirty years. I‚Äôm aware of how refrigeration works.

And then the grossest thing happens as I nod dejectedly. During his rambling, as we're passing the rotisserie chickens he pops one open and just... grabs a wing. No shame. Just snatches it up like this is his own personal feeding trough. He smiles at me sheepishly and says ""Perks of the job ehehe""

I shook my head and kept rolling along. If I could just get some fruit I can finally escape. I didn't want him to offer me a saliva-covered bag again (even though I really wanted apples) so I headed to the melons.

‚ÄúYou know...‚Äù says Derek as he continues to leans into my personal space, clearly desperate to force the conversation to continue... ‚Äúmost people don‚Äôt know how to tell when a melon is ripe and uhhh ...ready.‚Äù

Suddenly the hand that was on my cart again shoots up and he smacks the ever-loving fuck out of a nearby cantaloupe. Like, full palm, with his greasy chicken-hand. It was loud enough to make a baby in the next aisle over start crying.

‚ÄúYa gotta thump it. See?"" He slams the melon again. Stress fractures are beginning to develop on the rind. ""Like this. See? Now that‚Äôs a mature fruit.... It's juicy. And ready. Like a lady who knows what she wants.‚Äù

And then this degenerate winks at me. HE WINKED AT ME. I could feel my soul briefly leave my body, go outside, light a cigarette, and seriously consider starting a new life in some other dimension. I wanted to roll myself into the parking lot and start praying for my own vehicular manslaughter.

My skin began to crawl. I never should've taken the headphones out. I should have told him off the instant he started in on me... I did see a chance for revenge however. So I asked him, ""Are you sure that melon is good? I didn't hear the thump. It didn't sound like it's supposed to sound...""

""You dumb broads can't do anything right... I thought you were supposed to be good at cooking!"" he groaned. Not like you need to cook a canteloupe, but I didn't say that. Just watched intently as his ham first went up and smashed down onto the melon once more. It didn't break.

At this point I couldn't just cut my losses and move on, I was in too deep. So I looked at him innocently, fluttered my lashes and said ""Gosh... I think maybe I heard it. Maybe just show me one more time so I can remember it in my little girly brain""

He hitched his pants up like a gold-rush miner who had just struck it rich. I smiled sweetly and encouraged him with a nod. His hand went up and back down... But this time the melon had taken too much abuse. It was blasted into about 10 separate pieces that went spinning away under shelves and carts and displays.

Time slowed down. One chunk bounced into a shopping basket. Another landed perfectly in an old lady‚Äôs purse. Somewhere, a grape rolled mournfully off a shelf like a cinematic metaphor. I think I saw something like that in the Godfather. I choose to recycle it here. He had a look of absolute shock on his stupid face. I put my hands to my cheeks to mimic the shocked expression and said 'Oh no! I was going to take that one home with me...'

As Derek knelt to scoop up pieces of melon, I backed my cart up and turned toward the checkout. There was the shadow of an evil grin on my face. 

Behind me, Derek tried to call for another employee, he wheezed ""uhhh cleanup in produce..."" but his the speakers overhead only crackled with static. Even the store‚Äôs ancient PA system didn‚Äôt want to help him. Then I thought I heard him mutter ‚Äúwomen, man...‚Äù under his breath. The thought occurred to me to correct him and explain that this was done by his own stupid fat hand... But I decided my time would be better spent on basically anything else. So I left him there, surrounded by fruit carnage and moral defeat. Perhaps a lesson was learned, I thought.

I knew I shouldn't have done it, but believe me when I tell you that I would end up paying for it dearly the next time I ran into Derek. Let‚Äôs just say this: I thought the produce aisle was bad. I hadn‚Äôt yet seen what happens when Derek is given authority over the meat department. But that's a story for another day.",1,1759912119.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

Many truck drivers want to quit: ‚ÄúSometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up.‚Äù

High work pressure, traffic jams, full parking lots, lack of understanding, and loneliness ‚Äì truck drivers are struggling. A large number are even considering quitting. ‚ÄúIf all those drivers stop, the economy will grind to a halt.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm still a bit stiff,‚Äù says the Dutch-Italian truck driver Tommaso Tartaglione (28) as he unfolds himself from his cabin. With small, tired eyes he looks out over the Den Ruygen Hoek-Oost parking and rest area and the stream of cars on the A4 near Rijsenhout. On the fifty truck parking spots there‚Äôs a constant coming and going of truckers taking breaks, eating in the bridge restaurant, or sleeping in their cabs.  
It‚Äôs ten in the morning. Tartaglione has just woken up and is looking for coffee. ‚ÄúThe stronger, the better,‚Äù he says, though he fears a weak espresso. He has slept barely four hours.  
In one week, Tartaglione and his father Dino (50) have driven three times from Naples to distribution centers around Schiphol, a trip of over 1,800 kilometers. He no longer remembers exactly what he transported. ‚ÄúClothes? Electronics? Something like that.‚Äù He focuses on the road; traffic jams, finding rest areas, and a tight schedule make it difficult enough.  
‚ÄúYou have to stay alert all the time, there‚Äôs always a rush,‚Äù says Tartaglione after getting his coffee at Starbucks. ‚ÄúHopefully I‚Äôll make my slot time.‚Äù That‚Äôs the time assigned for loading and unloading. His face tightens after the first sip. He sighs: ‚ÄúSometimes I wonder how much longer I can keep this up. And I‚Äôm not even thirty yet.‚Äù",3,1759912102.0,Truckers,3,1.0,False

I told her that I can make changes in myself if that‚Äôs what you want, but she said no, She can‚Äôt date me, then she said that I might have everything but I don‚Äôt have what she wants, in the end I told her that I still have feelings for her, and for me it‚Äôs gonna be the same in the future too, now it‚Äôs on you how you interpret it, I have made myself clear.

1o14ual,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1o14ual/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 08/10/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

We sat down, and within 10 minutes‚Ä¶ silence. Not the comfortable kind ‚Äî the loud, awkward one where you can literally hear your heartbeat.
I tried small talk, ran out of topics, and ended up complimenting the coffee cup design. ‚òïüíÄ

Now I‚Äôm home wondering ‚Äî how do you people do this social thing without mentally buffering every 5 seconds? Any tips for surviving these moments gracefully? üò¨",3,1759911846.0,IntrovertsChat,2,1.0,False
1o14t36,https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1o14t36/im_trans_and_cant_stand_other_trans_people/,I‚Äôm trans and can‚Äôt stand other trans people,"This isn‚Äôt to say violence or prejudice towards us is okay in any form. I‚Äôm sharing my own complaint about the mainstream trans community, which is largely the white transfem community. I am a black trans man and have often felt completely excluded from mainstream trans spaces, have been made to feel like I‚Äôm less of a man by trans women while being gaslit and ingenuously accused of being xyz term as a means of avoiding accountability.

Posting on a throwaway for obvious reasons. But yeah, a lot of trans people give us a bad name and they REFUSEEEE to even acknowledge the role they play in that. 

Like ok yes. For instance is lot of people believe black people, like myself, are aggressive and obnoxious and a terror to be around. That is not true for the whole of black people, but are there people of my own race that I find myself shaking my head at SPECIFICALLY because they perpetuate harmful stereotypes with their behavior? Damn sure there is. 

It‚Äôs the same thing with trans people. 

Trans men who throw a tantrum when they grow facial hair when‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs literally what testosterone does, stupid. Trans women blowing a cap because not every straight cis man wants to be with them pre-op because‚Ä¶. They‚Äôre straight and cis. It‚Äôs the same for trans men.

I recognize that my genital situation is not ‚Äútypical‚Äù and it will be a dealbreaker for cisgender straight women who expect a man to have a penis, which I don‚Äôt have quite yet. And even when I do, I will never be able to get her pregnant, which is something my partner would have to be alright with. 

That‚Äôs a lot to ask of someone, and I don‚Äôt pretend that being trans is a walk in the park. It‚Äôs very much so a genetic defect, in my opinion, and not everyone is going to be open to dating a trans person the same way not everyone is going to be open to dating a disabled person or a person with significantly different cultural norms then them.

Granted, the vast MAJORITY of other trans people do not feel so entitled to cis straight peoples‚Äô attraction as the loudest minority but it still grinds my gears, BECAUSE they make us all look bad

And then they come on places like Reddit, crying about how other trans people say they make us look bad. That‚Äôs just the fucken truth! They do! They perpetuate harmful stereotypes because it makes them feel special and looked at while those same stereotypes they perpetuate are incredibly harmful to those of us who just want to FUCKEN LIVE!! We just wanna walk our dogs in the morning, get a bagel and some coffee, go to work, relax, whatever. 

These psychos who make their entire personality being trans are insufferable to us too, but now we have to live in total and complete fear of being put in concentration camps because those people see the stereotypes cis people have for us and feed into them, when we all know stereotypes are not true for the majority of people.

And I‚Äôm not talking about just being who you naturally are. I‚Äôm talking about not being able to shut up for 2 seconds about being trans, about accusing everyone who coughs at you wrong as being a transphobe. You‚Äôre allowed to be held accountable, my guy. And responding with such despondency when a cis person tries to hold you accountable for your BEHAVIOR only further fuels stereotypes that harm all of us.

That‚Äôs my rant. 

I can‚Äôt stand other trans people sometimes. They‚Äôre desperate for attention. They think being trans makes them quirky and unique (news flash it‚Äôs actually hell on earth). And they directly harm the rest of us by trying to be the face of trans people and directly feeding into stereotypes. ",4,1759911815.0,complaints,10,0.75,False
1o14sz8,https://i.redd.it/h7i402tclutf1.jpeg,I caught myself being rude,"This morning, I was standing outside Apple on Rennweg texting when a man came up to me. As I usually do, I ignored him at first. He stood there for maybe five seconds before I turned and realised he was simply trying to sell a Surprise magazine. I quickly said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt have anything.‚Äù

He crossed the street and started approaching others ‚Äî all dressed in suits, rushing to work, caught up in their own worlds. One by one, they ignored him. I stood there, outside Apple, in warm clothes, with an apartment, a job in an office, and about to buy a pair of headphones‚Ä¶ yet I‚Äôd just told a man standing out in the cold, wearing basic clothes, that I couldn‚Äôt afford to give him 8 francs ‚Äî of which he only keeps 4.

And I thought to myself, what have I become? He has it so much harder, and most of us take so much for granted.

So I want to appeal to others: next time someone like that approaches you, please don‚Äôt just ignore them. Remember ‚Äî you probably spend more on a coffee than on that magazine. Even if you can‚Äôt buy one, look them in the eye, say hello, and apologise kindly. They‚Äôre people too, just trying to get by.

So I have decided to wake up at 5 am, quietly clean my teeth, have a cup of water&coffee, take dog for a walk and then usually slightly after 06 am head for a tram ride to a nearby park where I run. My problems are that now when the weather is autumn'ish I am cold after the walk with dog and then I dread the 15 min ride to the park as by then I am so cold. If I would put lot's of layers on me then obviously I am 10 min in the run steaming hot and will overheat. 

Second question is how do you train for example intervals this early in the morning? In the morning I can run quite comfortable in a tempo 6-6:20 min/km but I feel so weak when I should be doing some anaerobic training. 

I had last year surgery of my knee and since then I cannot run on the street - need to run on natural ground - hence why I am going to the nearby park by tram. I live in the Central Europe if that helps. Thanks for all the help!
