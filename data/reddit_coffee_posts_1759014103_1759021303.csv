I want a grinder that can handle both pour overs(hario switch) and espresso. My frustration is that adjusting the grind size between the two methods is leading to inconsistency in grind sizes for at least a couple grinds between the adjustments.  I’m using Strait single origin coffee so I don’t really want to waste 40 to 100 g of coffee to re-dial in what should be the right setting(no adjustment between these runs, it just seems to need to run a few times to actually match the setting).

Something is nudging me towards the timemore 078ssp and I am not sure what it is and I can’t find a comparison or a review to see what I may or may not miss out on with the SSP burrs.  This could absolutely be an itch for a shiny new toy, I’ll admit but I also am hoping to get a more consistent grinder that can grind light roasts well.

Looking for suggestions to make sure I am aiming in the right direction, thanks in advance!",1,1759021198.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I'll take my sister and a friend to a concert in Lincoln Financial (or Wells Fargo) on a weekday so I need to find somewhere to hang out as I don't want to go back and forth to NJ (50 miles one-way). I already know where I'll have dinner but I need to find somewhere afterwards. I want to be able to freely use my laptop/iPad to study and not annoy any staff.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably quiet (not like a library but hate blasting music), with normal tables, and good coffee (not a drinker). Ok with a 25-mile radius including Wilmington DE.

Does Cira Green have tables?

1nsb6gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1nsb6gh/thrombosed_external_hemorrhoid_removal_concerns/,Thrombosed External Hemorrhoid Removal Concerns,"I’m 21M and on Thursday (9/25) I went to the ER after struggling with an intense external hemorrhoid for a full week. The doctor took a look and said it was thrombosed and offered to remove it. I agreed and he did it, sent me home that same night. 

Woke up the next morning and took off all of the gauze and bandages. Lots of blood and had a small bowel movement with lots of blood too. Took a shower and cleaned as directed with antibacterial soap. I gently dried off and reapplied my own gauze. I did this same process twice that day. 

Today, I woke up and again had a very small bowel movement but minimal blood in the toilet. I immediately took another shower and minimal blood there too. I gently dried and put another gauze on. I kept my gauze on for a few hours and then took it off and it was rather bloody. I applied a lidocaine cream that was prescribed to me and did not put a gauze back on. After a few more hours I went to check and I was still actively bleeding so I put another gauze in place. Later today I removed that gauze and sat in a sitz bath for about 10 minutes, got out, gently dried off and didn’t reapply a gauze. I go back in the bathroom to check for blood and there is still a fair amount so I put on another gauze. 

1. So I guess my main question is, how long will active bleeding last? I know I’m just getting to the 48 hour mark but I’m really concerned and scared about it. I’m feeling pretty minimal pain (2/10) but I am still very scared. 

2. Another question I have is about coffee. Usually when I wake up in the mornings I will have a cup of coffee to assist in my morning bowel movement. I’ve struggled with constipation my entire life and as I’ve gotten older I’ve found that coffee seems to make things a lot easier. The last two days, I have not had my morning cup out of fear it might make things worse. Can I try to have coffee tomorrow morning to make things a little easier? If not, how long should I wait?

[Ascaso anthracité i1],"So I got this grinder yesterday, and I can’t quite put my finger on what’s wrong with it. For context, it’s a 54mm flat burr grinder. I got it second-hand for free, and I was really happy about it since I’m a broke student who just started appreciating lighter roasted coffees (it was so hard grinding light roast with my Timemore C3 ESP).

The problem is, it won’t grind fine enough for espresso, even though it’s advertised as a stepless espresso grinder. I’ve tightened it until the burrs touch—so much that the upper one actually moves the lower one while I adjust it—and still, the shots I pull run in a maximum of 20 seconds, **even while I’m hearing burr chirp**. Worst of all, I can’t find a single thing online about this specific grinder.

I opened it, cleaned it thoroughly, cleared out all the old coffee stuck inside, realigned the burrs, and tightened everything down. But no matter how much I push it, it’s just not grinding fine enough.

For context, I used a really dark roast that I know well (one I’ve dialed in before with other grinders) to test this one out. At this point, I’m out of options and wondering if anyone here has any knowledge about this grinder, or a way to make it work, since it’s my only option right now.",1,1759020665.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I was born with EDS, POTS, mitral valve regurgitation, a hole in my heart, and intestinal malrotation. as a kid i was always sick, i starved myself because if i ate too much i'd throw it back up and hunger always just felt better. i nearly had to get a feeding tube in, and i was generally just going through the motions, because my heart issues and EDS just made everything worse. anyway, when i was 9, i had a surgery for the intestinal malrotation, which is where the eating issues stemmed from. the surgery itself was traumatic, along with things like complete paralysis beforehand, a panic attack in an mri machine, allergic reaction to betadine, and the cocktail of drugs they got me on afterward (mostly painkillers for post-surgical pain and antihistamines for the allergic reaction), it all left me mostly empty. my EDS and chronic joint pain only got worse, and i still never ate well.

the first time i wanted to kill myself i was 10 years old. i dont remember too much, since i was in and out of dissociation by this point. i didnt know how, so i tried drinking essential oils which tasted bad, and then i went to bed. of course, nothing happened and i went to school the next day. the second time i was 12, i had horded allergy medication for a week or so and downed them before going to sleep, and again nothing happened. at that point i was deeply dissociating, and my chronic pain only got worse. then i found out about my family history. my mother's father took his own life after a struggle with bipolar type 1, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety. it turned my grandmother into a pill addict and my uncle into an alcoholic. i cant even describe how guilty i felt at trying to take my own life. i still remember that pit in my stomach as i swore to myself that i would never tell my parents.

i dont remember much between 12 to 16 because i was in a near constant state of dissociation from the chronic pain, ptsd, and depression. 

but then i made it out of the dissociation, i remember the exact moment, i was talking to my mother about something or whatever, and she said something along the lines of ""That surgery really sucked for you."" and it was the first time anybody made me realize how much i hated thinking about it. i was making decaffeinated coffee at 9pm and i remember it almost spilling over like in a movie before i just said something like ""yeah.""

the following years i was more lucid, for better and worse. i was more consciously aware of how much i hated myself but also more conscious of what i liked in the world. i ignored the good bits mostly because of how overwhelming the horrible feelings were. eventually i started seeing therapists, being diagnosed with PTSD, generalized anxiety, major depressive disorder, depersonalization, and dissociation. i had a 9 month long relationship and went through half of college, and here i am, on antidepressants and i think i want to live. i dont think ive ever really been good at feeling strong emotions but i get a horrible feeling when i think about my future, just dreading it because now i care about losing it.

1nsb2vx,https://i.redd.it/th9cqwz2zsrf1.jpeg,Kenya,"Kenya is a state in Eastern Africa. Kenya's geography, climate and population vary widely. In western rift valley counties, the landscape includes cold, snow-capped mountaintops (such as Batian, Nelion, and Point Lenana on Mount Kenya) with vast surrounding forests, wildlife, and fertile agricultural regions in temperate climates. In other areas, there are dry, arid, and semi-arid climates, as well as absolute deserts (such as Chalbi Desert and Nyiri Desert). Kenya's earliest inhabitants included some of the first humans to evolve from ancestral members of the genus Homo. Ample fossil evidence for this evolutionary history has been found at Koobi Fora. Later, Kenya was inhabited by hunter-gatherers similar to the present-day Hadza people. According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, Cushitic speakers first settled in the region's lowlands between 3,200 and 1,300 BC, a phase known as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. Nilotic-speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya's Nilotic speakers) began migrating from present-day South Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC. Bantu people settled at the coast and the interior between 250 BC and 500 AD. European contact began in 1500 AD with the Portuguese Empire, and effective colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of Africa. Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate, established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony, which began in 1920. Mombasa was the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate, which included most of what is now Kenya and southwestern Somalia, from 1889 to 1907. Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution, which began in 1952, and the declaration of Kenya's independence in 1963. After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country's current constitution was adopted in 2010, replacing the previous 1963 constitution. Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic, in which elected officials represent the people and the president is the head of state and government. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, COMESA, International Criminal Court, as well as several other international organisations. Kenya's economy is the largest in East and Central Africa, with Nairobi serving as a major regional commercial hub. With a Gross National Income of $8,110, the country is a middle income economy. Agriculture is the country's largest economic sector; tea and coffee are the sector's traditional cash crops, while fresh flowers are a fast-growing export. The service industry, particularly tourism, is also one of the country's major economic drivers. Kenya is a member of the East African Community trade bloc, though some international trade organisations categorise it as part of the Greater Horn of Africa. Africa is Kenya's largest export market, followed by the European Union. ",1,1759020509.0,imaginarymapscj,0,1.0,False

(All identifying info changed) My name is John. I was born and raised in Minneapolis, by my mother, Debra. My mom suffered from BPD, and my siblings and I suffered with her. Unfortunately, we did not have the knowledge, or the courage, to help her work through this disorder, and she took her own life on December 30th 2012.

I am writing this for two reasons: First, I want to help the people that suffer from BPD, and I want to help those who suffer with them. Second, selfishly perhaps, I would like to tell my story.

Living with someone who suffers from BPD can be difficult, especially at a young age. I know for me, there was a large chunk of my teen years where I was not sure whether I was a bad kid, even though it didn’t quite add up. I thought I was a good kid, even though my grades didn’t showcase that. I didn’t get into fights, I didn’t drink, I didn’t smoke, I didn’t bring a different girl home every night, and I never got in trouble with the police. Yet, I was at odds with my mom and I couldn’t figure out why. For a short time I decided that there must be something inherently wrong with me, so I decided to figure out what that was.

I started researching online, blindly throwing darts hoping that I would just happen to hit a bulls-eye. I did. In my mothers bookcase, which was conveniently located right outside of my bedroom door, was a book full of information on every personality disorder possible. She had highlighted several parts of the book because she strongly suspected someone she was romantically involved with a while back was a psychopath. I was flipping through the book, because it seemed pretty old and was probably useless to me, when I stopped at a page that had “Borderline Personality Disorder” highlighted. I read, and read, and read, with each sentence my eyes growing wider. So what now? I knew what she was struggling with, and even saw some of the symptoms in myself, but had no idea how to approach the idea. Naively, I tried the direct approach of telling her that something was wrong with her. I spent that night at a friend’s house.

As time went by, I decided that it was best not to tell her. I decided that I would simply talk with her, be her sounding board, and try my best to not be the thing that ignited her. I thought, for many years, that it worked. When I moved out of the house, though, everything started to fall apart. My sister was thirteen at the time and she, like me, had to grow up at a very early age. When I left, my sister became her new outlet. Luckily for both of them, they had developed a special bond early on, and their friendship was deeper than any friendship I could ever imagine. My mothers’ downward spiral probably could not have been avoided, but I will always feel like if I had stayed just a few more years, that everything would have been fine. If I had stayed maybe she would still be here today, still calling me “sweet boy”, helping my fiancée and I plan our wedding.

I didn’t stay, though, and she isn’t here.

In September of 2012, she came to the realization that she struggled with BPD. She casually brought it up while we were having our weekly lunch get-together. I was overcome with emotion, and thought that this realization was the first in a series of steps towards overcoming the disorder. I wondered what it would be like to have a mother who wasn’t convinced that the neighbors were having secret “We hate [my mother]” meetings. I wondered what it would be like to have a mother that didn’t think I have always hated her if I didn’t respond to a text message within half an hour. I wondered what it would be like for my sister, who could finally be released from the stress and grief associated with being a sounding board for someone with BPD. I was relieved that I wouldn’t have to explain to my kids that their grandmother loved them very much, but she gets angry sometimes and there is nothing we can do. That dream remained just that, a dream.

Every couple of months there would be a suicide scare. We would get a call from her boyfriend saying that he couldn’t find her. Often, we would wait and she would come back later that day, fine. Every once in a while she would tell us that she had tried to kill herself. That she had taken a bunch of pills out in the woods, and when she woke up she was back home and had no idea how she got there. I thought that these were just cries for attention, cries for help. It was not unusual for someone with BPD to resort to such tactics, so after the first couple of times we grew immune to the pain.

3:20, Sunday, December 30th. I got a call from my brother. He told me that he had just gotten a call from my mom’s boyfriend and that he was freaking out. He said that she had taken her car, disassembled her phone, left her purse and all of its contents, and left a note telling me what to do in the event of her death. This didn’t feel right. I had talked to her earlier that morning, and though she wasn’t happy with several things, it did not feel different from most of the calls like this one. She had showed me the note telling me what to do in the past, so I knew of it, but she had never left it out. It just didn’t feel right. So I told my fiancée that we had to go and we left right away. Around 4:00 I arrive at her house and I immediately reassemble the phone and turn on her computer, hoping for a text message or an email that would give a clue as to where she is. There was nothing except for an angry email that she had sent to her parents at 2:15. The temperature was below freezing, so I knew that unless she was properly clothed she would not be able to survive but a few hours in the weather. Her jacket, her sweatshirts, everything was still there. So we went out, desperately searching the trails within a mile of the house while we still had sunlight. The sun went down, but we kept driving around, searching parking lots and back roads to parks, bike trails, and walking trails in the area. Again, we found nothing. We spent a good amount of time focused on a nature center about three miles from the house. It was huge, over 160 acres, but there was no car in the only parking lot and a quick search of the nearby industrial park yielded no results. We went back to the house, hoping to see her car in the driveway. Again, there was disappointment. By this time we decided that it was best to notify the police. We told them her favorite parks and trails, and they promised to search the parking lots for parks nearby. A brief, sleepless night later, and we congregated to no new news. We all knew that if she was outside, even with proper clothing, she was unlikely to be alive. While others prepared for the impending drunk-fest that is New Years Eve, we continued our search for the car. We attacked the search with newfound hope since the sun was again high in the sky. After spending about three hours searching, we went home to have lunch and come up with a new plan, because searching for a car when we have no idea where to go is like searching for a needle in a haystack. I went through her phone book, calling her closest friends, hoping that she drove to one of their houses and is safe and sound, but she was nowhere to be found. As I sat there, wondering what to do next, a pretty simple idea hit me. I went to Google Earth and zoomed in on the house. Methodically, I spun the wheel on the mouse towards me, zooming out little by little. I am scanning the map, knowing that she wouldn’t go far, knowing that she would only go to a place that she felt comfortable with. A place that she thought was beautiful. I zoomed out one more click and it could not have been more obvious. That nature center was huge, and my sister told me that she really liked one certain trail in that park. That had to be it. I told my brother and my mom’s boyfriend that we should head out and search the back roads behind the nature center. There was a little private airport and some side streets that she could have parked at and entered from private land. We head out, once again driving by the industrial park and towards the back of the park. I can feel it, this has to be it, and there is no doubt in my mind that she is in that park. We search the back roads and find nothing. My heart sinks and I feel defeated. I regain hope that she just drove to a friend’s house in another state, and I didn’t know them well enough to think she would be there. As we are driving back, we drive by the industrial park again, for probably the fifth or sixth time since the search began. I pipe up, asking if we can search the industrial park one more time, just to make sure. As we are driving through, with the benefit of the sun giving us light, my brother sees the car first. There it is, her dark blue, 2001 Chevrolet Tracker, parked between two semi trailers, behind a building, hidden from view.

2:30pm, December 31st. I was overcome with pain as I ran to the car and saw it empty, the keys on the floor of the locked car. She was not at a friend’s house. She was not in a warm building somewhere, safe and sound. She was not sitting in her car listening to Enya, driving to the coast. She was outside, in the elements, without her winter coat, and it had been 24 hours since anybody had heard from her. I immediately called the cops and let them know. For the next three hours, but only two hours of sunlight, they conduct an all-out search, including a hundred people, search dogs, a thermal imaging camera atop a helicopter, ATV’s, the whole nine yards. By 6:30, though, the search is officially called off and they cross off the nature center as one of the suspected locations. I call the lieutenant and he says that they can not justify sending more people out to search the nature center tomorrow, when the sun comes back up, when he feels that the search conducted left no doubt that she was not in the nature center. This angers me, but I am a very understanding person, and I understand that devoting that kind of volunteer manpower for a second consecutive day could be considered irresponsible. I tell him that I will gather a search party, and that we will continue searching the park the next day, to which he says that he will send a couple squads out with us and he asks me to give him a call when we leave so that they can meet us there.

After another sleepless night, I give him a call at the crack of dawn the next day as my mom’s boyfriend and I drive out to the park to meet some close friends. I am informed that they will not be able to help with the search. At this point, I don’t care. We found the car, and we were going to find the body. As the sun rises, about 30 of our closest friends meet us at the park and help with the search. It was near 0 degrees that day, and keeping people’s spirits up and bodies warm was a real concern, so many people who were coming promised to bring hot coffee and donuts. I head out with the first group, walking along her favorite trails. It doesn’t feel right. I break off from the group and walk in the opposite direction that they are searching, heading deeper into the woods. I am by myself, adrenaline pumping because I want to be the one to find her, I want that burden. I stand, alone, in the woods, with no trail in eyesight. I ask her to help me, I ask her to help me find her. Something tells me that I am in the wrong spot, so I head back to the trail. Soon after I get back to the trail I get a call from a couple friends of mine saying that they are in the parking lot and are not sure what to do. I head back to meet with them and give them some guidance. While they talk amongst themselves, I walk over to the crude map of the nature center. I stare at it for what felt like only a few seconds and I am overwhelmed with the urge to search the far left corner. It is the farthest away from the road she came in on, and it only has one trail in that part of the park, which means it would garner the least amount of foot traffic. The forest is dense and full of thorn bushes (bushes isn’t really fair, they were more like trees), making it difficult to walk through. Already I could feel several fresh cuts dripping blood from my arms and legs, and that was after a brief foray off the trail. I sent the people who I deemed weaker to go and find the group already searching in the right side of the park. I then gathered my closest, and strongest, friends to push our way through the forest. The whole time we are spread out and searching, it feels right. I feel like it is only a matter of time. The other side of the park was full of huge paw prints from the dogs that were out the previous night, it was full of ATV tracks and footprints that led ten feet into the forest then returned to the path. Where we were, the tracks were few and far between, and there were no dog tracks. As we work our way through, we near the back of the nature center and I am starting to feel defeated. I truly thought that she was there.

As I stand and talk with my friends who found me at the edge of the nature center, I get a call. It is my father, and he tells me that he found her. I tell him to whistle so that I can know which direction to head, and I run through the forest towards him, and towards my mother.

My father was in my group and he was covering the furthest corner, and he said something led him across the field where he found her, just ten feet in the next section of woods. She was wearing a snowsuit that she had had since before I was born, I hadn’t seen that snowsuit in at least 10 years. She had ripped off the hood of her snowsuit, taken off her gloves, and stumbled a few feet to her final resting spot, facedown on a thorn bush. She had overdosed on OxyContin, made worse by the bottle of rum she brought, and froze to death. I know that when she died, she was out of her body because her final resting place was a few feet from where she was sitting, and her face was in a thorn bush. Her body was pale and tight, the first dead body I had ever seen. As I rushed to her side I was overtaken by anger, frustration, and disappointment. I let out a scream that friends said could be heard from a mile away. I told her that I loved her, that I understood, and that I wished she had called me before she left, like she had so many other times. I told her that I would take care of my younger sister. I told her that I am the man I am today because of her, and that she was the best mother a son could have ever asked for. I told her that I would never forget her. I called the police and waited for them to arrive. I called my fiancée, and my mother’s boyfriend to tell them that she was found and to spread the word. I looked around me, and noticed that no more than 10 feet away from her were fresh ski tracks from someone cross country skiing. No more than 30 feet from her were tracks from one of the ATV’s used to search for her. Both of these tracks cut directly across the tracks left by my mothers’ boots. I solemnly walked back to the parking lot, where cop cars, fire trucks, news trucks, and an ambulance waited. I followed the tracks left by her boots, and suddenly they were clear, all the way back to the parking lot. I was looking for those tracks from the moment we entered the park and now there they were, clear as day. It was during this walk that I first started to notice just what a toll trudging through the woods was having on my body. Walking through the deep snow had my bad hamstring aching like it hadn’t ached in years. My arms, legs, and face burned from the many cuts left by the many thorn bushes I was forced to push through. There was a huge bruise on my thigh, and I could not recall how I got it. It was well below freezing and I had spent hours searching for her wearing two pairs of sweatpants, and a single sweatshirt. None of this had hit me until after it was over, and now it was hitting me in droves.

I got back and was immediately inundated with fellow searchers looking to give me a hug and share their condolences. I know they meant well, but the last thing I wanted to do was deal with other people’s feelings after finding my dead mother. I said the same couple of lines to everybody, which basically amounted to “Thank you for coming,” and “I really appreciated you coming” if they didn’t stop talking after my first response. I gave my statement, assured the police that I was physically fine after searching in the cold, and went home to tell my sister. 

We had both mentally prepared for this, not just in the past 48 hours but for the past several years. We gave each other a knowing, sad look, and embraced. She told me that she had a feeling that she had passed since the moment I told her what was going on. I couldn’t disagree, because I had the same feeling.

I knew my mother, I knew that she would be in a park that she knew and loved, and it confused me that she would go to a random spot to die. This was not like her. I was convinced that she would only go to a place with special meaning to her, which is why her boyfriend and I first searched her favorite trail. After she was found, it was hard for my to convince myself that she would go somewhere randomly. That changed after I brought my younger sister to where we found her, about four weeks after it happened. We did not let her search with us, because the possibility (and honestly, probability) of her finding our mother was too great. How terrible of an older brother would I be if I let my 15 year old sister find her dead mother? Anyways, we pulled into the parking lot for the nature center and I showed her where it was on the map, and she asked in which direction. On the way there, she asked a couple of questions that I thought were just innocently inquisitive, but in reality they were probing. When we got to the spot she broke down in tears and told me that a couple of months ago, when our mother and she were walking her favorite trail, my sister recommended that they take a shortcut through the woods. This led them to an open prairie, where they realized that they were lost. Without a phone signal, nor any idea as to where they were, they couldn’t help but be concerned. So they walked around the prairie for a bit, and had a good time just being with one another. They eventually made it back safely, but my mother never forgot about that location. It was ten feet off that very same prairie that we found her, facing the tree line that she and my sister had spent that day prancing around.

Throughout this entire first month I have not been able to shake the feeling that she did not really want to die. I know that I am wrong, but I can’t help but look at little, meaningless clues and think “What if”. She had crawled a few paces from where she was sitting to her final resting place, and those few paces were in the direction of the parking lot. There was still rum left in the bottle that was already near empty when she took it, so maybe she knew that alcohol would only speed the process, giving searchers less time to find her. She did not go very deep into the next set of woods after the prairie, so maybe she was hoping that we would know where to go and find her relatively quickly. I know that all of this is ridiculous, but I can’t help the fact that I am constantly thinking about it. Some part of me wants to believe that I did not let her down, when I know that I did. Some part of me wants to believe that she didn’t really want to die, when I know that she did. Some part of me wants to believe that I couldn’t have done anything, when I know that I could have.

It made sense now, why she chose that spot, but I am not sure if that helps or hurts my internal struggle. I now know that she was soaked with happy memories before she died. I now know that she was not wallowing in a pit of sorrow, but instead remembering the good times in the life she lived. If she were wallowing in a pit of sorrow, I could at least blame this whole thing on her just being in a particularly bad frenzy. This was not the case, though. Now I know that despite all of her good memories and feelings, she still felt like she had no other options in life, as she had told me that morning. This kills me. I have nothing to blame her suicide on but her. Some would say that I should blame it on the disorder, but the disorder did not make her who she was, it was just a part of her. Blame is also a harsh word, though I will not deny being angry with her for good portions of the first 48 hours, it is not so much that I blame her, but instead that I wish I understood, because I don’t. I never will understand the way she felt, because I never understood the way she felt about anything. Like before, I need to nod my head and accept that she felt like that even though I will never understand.

One thing that is still hard for me to think about is the fact that we might have found her sooner. I know we probably wouldn’t have, but what if. We had driven through the industrial park the night she went missing, but we stayed on the streets and never went into a parking lot to get a better view. It was dark. We all knew we couldn’t see very well. Yet we just breezed through there. What if we had found her car that night? There certainly wouldn’t have been the same effort put into the search by the police, since it was that same night and they seemed to doubt, at least early on, that suicide was a serious possibility. But if by some luck (good or bad, I’m not sure) we were able to find her and she was still alive… When we turned to my sister, asking her where mom would have gone, she said either the pine trees trail, or some open meadow that they walked to once. She, however, had only a rough idea as to where the meadow was. It would have been incredibly difficult to find that meadow in the dark, especially since it was nowhere near any trail. But my sister seemed to know the direction that it was in when I brought her to the spot, maybe she would have known where to look, and maybe our mom, unhappily, would still be alive today. That is what I have to keep telling myself, she would have been unhappy. She wanted to die, I know this. I don’t understand, but I know.

I had accepted long ago that I was going to lose my mother to suicide; it was just a matter of when. Still, there was always this part of me that believed that it wouldn’t actually happen. She loved so many things in life, and so many people loved her, that I hoped it would be enough. I underestimated BPD, and I promised myself after this happened that I would never underestimate a personality disorder again.

Finally, over five weeks since her death, I got back the possessions she left behind in the car and on her person, and the car itself. Not among those things was a letter for me. There was a letter for my younger sister, but none for my brother or myself. This, for me, was quite disappointing. The last conversation that I had with her was not the conversation I wanted to end our relationship. After I hung up the phone, I turned to my fiancée and told her that it would be easier for me if both of my parents were dead. I obviously didn’t mean that, but it was the very first thing that I said after the last conversation I would ever have with my mother. I was hoping that she would write me a letter, telling me that she loved me and she was happy just couldn’t live anymore, but that I am a great person and was a great kid. I guess in a perfect world she would have been of sound mind when she was sitting in her car for the last time. Of course she wasn’t, but I still held out hope. As the letters were being handed to me I saw that neither of them had my name on them. I felt a sudden rush of sadness and I had to turn away, the feeling of my insides being ripped out continuing even as I tried to focus on other things. I could not hide the pain on my face and the person I brought with me to drive my car back while I drove my moms got up to console me and I shook my head. I reassured her that I was fine and I turned back to the box full of evidence bags. Inside the bags were, for the most part, the clothes that she was wearing when she died. This didn’t bother me as much as I thought it would, but it was irksome. I can’t help but feel disappointed that I didn’t get a letter. My brother got a CD in the mail that she had ordered the day before she killed herself, my sister got a letter, and I was left with nothing. I was always referred to as her needy kid, but I feel like this sadness is justified.

I could spend years regretting and wishing for something different, but the fact is that I can’t change the past. I love my mom, and the strength she showed inspires me every day. The only regret I have is not doing more to educate the public about BPD, but now maybe I can make myself a platform in which to do that.

BPD is something that few know how to deal with; when in reality it is very simple. Love is the answer. Love has always been the answer. When somebody is acting in a way that confuses you, it is easy to write them off as crazy and move on with your life. If you love them, though, you ask them what is bothering them, and you show them the love and the care that you have for them. You do not become frustrated. You do not become angered. You just listen. Listening is something that has been lost by my generation. Instead of making eye contact and hearing the person, we look at our phones, or our iPods, or down at the ground. These non-verbal communications say that we don’t care, yet we know that it is not what you say but what you do.

When somebody has BPD, they often struggle with little, nuanced things that we don’t even notice. If your neighbor walks out of their house and doesn’t acknowledge them, it is not because they are having a bad day but instead because they hate them. If they say something is hurting them and you respond with indifference because you don’t understand why it is bothering them, then you don’t give a shit about them and you never did. If you walk out of the house in the morning without telling them you will be outside, it is because you are avoiding them and trying to hide something. We can not implore them to think logically because to them they are the ones being logical. It is not a chemical imbalance, it is a mindset.

But better late than never, I guess

For my part, I regret wasting seven years to get to this point. I kept putting things off, trying again, and smoking again. I can honestly say now that it was easier than I ever thought it would be,but only after I was completely prepared. The lesson? More crucial than any technique or drug is readiness

If you want to save yourself time, cut down the struggle, and have a clear method for quitting,covering the plan, what to do after a relapse, understanding addiction, and even measuring your own level of dependence if you want all of this and more, I created this quit-smoking program that helped me and truly benefited me in:

-1.Quit smoking, make your parents proud, and free yourself from addiction while taking control over nicotine.
-2.Stop wasting the money you spend daily around $13or$14 in your country, maybe more
-3.Includes a book that helps you get back into fitness
-4.Learn how to restore your testosterone as a man and boost your metabolism
-5.Clean up your diet with healthy food.
-6.Discover healthy drinks to detox your blood. (Personally, I didn’t rely much on herbal teas since I don’t like them I prefer coffee)☕️ 

That’s it. Now take a closer look and understand it well 

Alright, here’s my advice as someone who’s been smoke-free for a year and seven months: if you really want to quit, you need to make the decision deep in your heart and mind that it’s over you’re done with cigarettes for good. Second, you’ve got to stay committed and follow a plan, a program, coaching, or even GPT-5. The main thing is that you stick to clear steps that show you your progress. I truly hope you quit, and that this program helps you the same way it helped me. Thanks🙏",8,1759020026.0,stopsmoking,1,1.0,False

I have been with my gf for 10 years and we’ve lived together for 9. I handle 98% of the cooking and usually clean up afterward too. My gf almost never rinses her dishes after she eats. She won’t finish cleaning up after I’ve cooked a meal unless I ask, and even then I often get a “yes” with no action unless I’m physically in the kitchen with her. If I make her a lunch, I know I’m going to look at Tupperware for a few days, but I keep cooking cause I love her and want her to do well. 

If I get fed up and clean up after her, I feel like a maid who does all the cooking, cleaning, AND dishes. If I leave the dishes so she notices and cleans them, I often look at them for days. I used to just clean them but my bitterness grew, so I stopped doing it and asked that she would. Now I’m looking at an average of 5-8 dirty dishes out at all times. Coffee mugs. Water glasses. Trash from takeout. Plates and utensils with leftover food from whatever I cooked her. 

I’ve told her how I feel disrespected when she doesn’t clean up after herself multiple times, but she says it’s no different than when I leave jackets out or paperwork on the counter. I always apologize and say I’ll try harder. I make multiple passes through the house a day and pick up anything that is out of place. I told her leaving dishes out feels different to me because 1) it’s rotting food, 2) she often puts jackets in my closet if I forget them and that only takes a few moments, whereas dishes take a while, and 3) she has told me I’m not allowed to stack her dishes up and put them in her office so they’re out of my sight because that feels disrespectful and petty to her. 

Every time I bring this up it turns into a fight. She usually denies that it’s a problem, and when I point out the dishes that are currently out, she has an excuse for why it’s there. “That’s only from this morning.” “I was just about to get to that.” The average dish sits out 2-3 days if I don’t cave and wash it. 

I have felt so loved and supported over the years, but lately the defensiveness when I voice a concern and feeling like a maid has gotten to me. I’ve even tried to get us into couples therapy but it hasn’t worked out, basically because it’s not a priority to her. I know no relationship is perfect, but I’ve found myself fantasizing about being alone and enjoying that more than staying even 2 more years feeling like this. I know she likely has AUDHD, so idk if  I should be more humble/patient or just leave? Advice appreciated. ",7,1759019762.0,relationship_advice,13,0.89,False

1nsaqg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/kimtherockstar/comments/1nsaqg1/always_lying_about_something/,Always lying about something,"Why do you LIE? You said that your blood sugar shot up and how you only ate a ""sugary Starbucks coffee & a small bacon sandwich"" TWO things your doctor told you to AVOID and that was ALL YOU HAD. Then you go on to admit that you did have more food then that, you admitted to having ""mac & cheese, hot Cheetos or chips, and boba tea"" You down right lie for no reason why do you do that it's so bizarre. How is 2 meals ""barely eating"" i don't understand that either

And why are you telling us how many calories is in food? you don't track calories so what's the purpose of that? You need to be tracking sugar & sodium dummy like your doctor told you to. Why is it so hard to concept that maybe it's WHAT YOU ARE EATING and WHAT YOU ARE PUTTING IN YOUR BODY that could be raising your blood sugar? How are you ever going to feel better if you are not HONEST about what you are eating?? You tell your doctor you hardly eat yet you gained weight since switching doctors that doesn't make any sense. When you got the weight lost shot last July you said you was 275-276 and now you are 289, the doctor can look at PAPER WORK and see that is a lie. You just lie about everything but you want to talk to us  about ""accountability""  you can't even be accountable for what you eat, everything is ""small"" you will say 4 hamburgers is a small meal no it's not. If you hardly ate and throw up as much as you claim you would be dropping weight period, I don't understand why the doctor doesn't call you out but it's probably because you went in there with your sad pathetic cyber bully story and he didn't wanna bring up the weight gain

If you are so miserable then call 911 and go to the hospital, complaining that you don't have a ride? It's no ones fault but your own that you don't have a drivers licenses or a car if you want full access to a car then go buy one and drive yourself to the hospital.  If you are in so much PAIN call 911 but you never call a ambulance because everything that you say is wrong with you is probably a over exaggerated lie 

If you call your doctor are you going to tell him "" hey so yeah i know i have diabetes & high blood pressure and you told me to watch my sodium & sugar but i totally disregarded your professional recommendations and decided to have a large sugary coffee, a bacon sandwich, hot Cheetos, mac and cheese and boba tea  and now my blood sugar is super high is it because of my blood pressure medicine?"" 

You put no effort into your health and wonder why it gets worse shocker! You take any vitamins you get off tiktok shop do you even read the ingredients & how many vitamins do you need anyways? why eat all these vitamins but not work on other things like loosing weight, exercise, stop vaping, drink more water, etc If you have heart or chest issues why are you vaping genius?

I felt weird at first but brushed it off.Since I been focusing on my fitness and health my Libido has gone up significantly. I wake up hard like a teenager again and I am in pretty good shape not just health wise but physique. Since I been getting really fit , I also seem to notice guys in real life more and admiring there physiques aswell. 

Well here is where things get interesting , I started getting hornier and downloaded a few apps to message people but never went any furthur. That was until I meet up with a guy I talked to for a few days for coffee. It was nice and he was attractive and friendly. He messaged me to come over the next day and I did . He asked me about my experiences and let him know I did not have any. He wanted to know what I like and I told him muscular bodies and sensuality. He said if I wanted to do anything and I said nothing too crazy. He asks if massages where ok and I said yes. He starts with me and has me take my shirt off first then he glides my underwear off leaving me naked and hard. He then ask me to massage him and he takes his clothes off and leaves himself naked aswell.

We both massage eachother and I like feeling on his muscles and feeling his strong hands on my naked body being exposed with him. He grabs my cock and I grab his and we both stroke eachother until we bust like volcanos. 

That has been the extent of our experiences the last month. But I feel weird and bad afterwards for a little while then in the mood again. This makes me question if I am gay or just horny and I guess holds up me from trying more . I like to ask you guys your insights and opinions on the matter

1nsaidn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nsaidn/creepy_old_dude/,Creepy Old Dude,"Three days in a row. Three days in a row I took my morning walk around my new neighborhood—a kind of Rocky Mountain suburbia where tall meadow grass sprouts from the sloping yards of earth-toned homes—and he was walking up his driveway.

Three days in a row, just after seven a.m., I left my cul-de-sac, perking my ears to make sure no car was coming around the blind curve, and walked onto the road along the ridge of the hill. Cool autumn air warming in the rising sun. Breathtaking view of snowcapped mountains in the distance. Skinny old guy with the perv mustache walking his ugly little poodle on a leash.

As always, dressed in puffy winter jacket, wool hat, jeans, and boots, he waved without a smile. Not some normal greeting but insistently, almost wildly, like something was off about him. And though my hand felt like a twenty-pound plate, I waved back.

Mathematically, the chances of meeting him at the exact same spot, where the driveway from his modest ranch home met the street, two days in a row had to have been one in a thousand. But three days? More like one in a million. Especially since, a full three weeks after moving out of hot noisy Denver, these were the first times I’d laid eyes on him.

Irritated, I kept walking along the ridge and down the hill, turned around and went back up. Sure enough, he stood in the shade of the ponderosa pines where my cul-de-sac connects to the road, as if waiting for me, his dog snuffling the grass. He waved again in that same frantic way. My stomach turned even though I hadn’t eaten breakfast.

You might be wondering what’s the big deal about an elderly man walking his dog and saying hi to a neighbor? Why would I even notice such a thing, much less let it bother me? I’ll tell you why. It was his vibe. A heaviness rising off him like heat from summer pavement that almost made me feel like puking.

And, no, I’m not that way with anyone else. I have no problem greeting the husky middle-aged jogger huffing by on his morning run. Happy to smile at the kids—boy of maybe eleven, girl of probably nine—waiting for the school bus. I even nod at the twenty-something blonde in the red Jeep who speeds past me every weekend morning on her way back from who knows what late night escapades.

Yet this guy, I couldn’t help but tense up when I was around. Like he’d done me some wrong, and I was holding a grudge my conscious mind couldn’t remember, though my body did, deep in my bones. Because I’m polite, I always waved back. Still, it took a ton of effort, and afterwards I felt rotten, like I’d thanked someone for spitting in my face.

That Friday before I went to bed, I set my alarm for six a.m. No way he’d be up that early on a Saturday. Yet out in the cool dawn, does and fawns nibbling the dewy grass, there he was again, walking up his damn driveway. I was so angry I crossed to the other side of the street. Still, I knew he saw me, the heaviness dropping on my shoulders like a wet coat.

I walked slowly this time, hoping he’d be gone from my cul-de-sac by the time I got back. No such luck. My stalker stood in the same place he always did at the junction of the road. Done with being nice, I marched past, ignoring his wave. And when I was most of the way to my house, turned around to give him the finger. He was already gone.

What the hell did he want from me? If he hadn’t been such a frail old bag of bones, I’d have been afraid for my safety. But since I could’ve probably killed him with one good punch to the head, it was nothing more than creepy. Though plenty at that.

The next morning, Sunday, I waited until after breakfast to take my walk. I wasn’t even surprised when he was there again, pacing up his fucking driveway like it was the most normal thing in the world. I can’t even articulate how much I hated this man.

I was so mad I didn’t even nod at Blondie as she whizzed by in her Jeep. Grinding my teeth, clenching my fists, I hurried back to the cul-de-sac, wanting only to get inside and lock my doors. I shook my head at the maniac as I went past. He didn’t react. Just kept waving.

On Monday, I skipped my morning walk and only headed out when I got home from work. He was there at the top of his driveway, of course. Always there. I turned around and went straight home to call the cops.

Breathlessly, I told them a crazy man was following me around my neighborhood. After a few minutes of trying to explain the gravity of the situation, and them reminding me that excessive friendliness wasn’t a crime, I accepted they wouldn’t be any help. I hung up.

Tuesday and Wednesday I didn’t go for a walk at all, just off to work at my usual time. On Thursday I ventured out a couple of hours after sundown, the night brisk and quiet. My heart pounded by the time I got to his driveway, except, wonder of wonder, he wasn’t there! Then my guts turned to cement at the scuffle of footsteps, the patter of little paws.

Red hot with rage, I was done. Absolutely done. “Hey, asshole!” Not having to see his wrinkled face made it easier to confront him.

The footsteps stopped, but he didn’t say anything. I could barely make out his figure, a dark stain in the night like an ink spill on a black page. “Why are you following me?”

No response.

“Well, I’m on to you,” I spat, voice shaking with anger. Or was it fear? “And if I catch you anywhere near me again, I’m gonna beat the living crap out of you.”

I stalked off into the night, pulse pounding in victory. One thing for sure, I got my point across. No way he’d still be out when I got back.

I turned around at the bottom of the hill and trekked up again, half hoping he was waiting for me so I could keep my promise. I imagined myself sweeping out his spidery legs and kicking him in the spine. Or shoving him hard in the chest so he fell on his bony butt. Or even just rearing back and decking him. While it’s true that, outside of grade school scuffles, I’ve never hit anyone, this time I knew I’d deliver. And damn the consequences.

On first glance, the cul-de-sac looked empty, but it was pitch black out, so I couldn’t be sure. I strode along, and, indeed, no one at the junction. I felt something inside of me that’d been tight for weeks finally unspool.

Next morning, up and at ‘em at my usual time. Though raring for a fight—verbal, physical, both—I had a feeling the old guy wouldn’t be there. And I was right, no sign of him on his driveway. I even waited a minute to be sure, but the door to his squat little house stayed shut.

For the first time in weeks, I enjoyed my walk. Fresh air in my lungs. Mountains glowing in the rising sun. Quiet. The whole reason I moved up from the crowded, stinking city.

Happily, my luck held the next morning, too. And the next. For a full blissful week I saw neither hide nor hair of the weirdo and his scrawny dog.

\*\*\*

Now, Sunday morning, the old man still MIA, I start to feel a tiny bit bad. With the break I’ve had, I’d be okay seeing him once in a while. It was just the everyday thing that bugged me. As I stroll along the ridge road, blood singing in my veins, sky pastel blue, I wonder if maybe I was overreacting.

After all, dogs need to go out at least a few times a day. So, of course, the guy would be out there first thing in the morning when everyone gets up. And, again, in the afternoon and evening, which happened to be the other times I took my walks.

By the time I get to the bottom of the hill, it dawns on me that these strolls with his dog might be the only way the old codger breaks up his day. I don’t think he’s married or works, so he probably looks forward to his little trips around the neighborhood as much as I do. And what if the reason he kept bumping into me is because he’s lonely and wants to talk but is too shy to say something?

What if *he’s* not the monster here…and I am?

On my way back I hope I’ll catch him in the cul-de-sac so I can apologize. Strike up a little conversation. Get to know him a bit. A few minutes out of my morning won’t kill me.

He’s not there. And my heart sinks. Still, it’s not too late to fix this.

Whistling a happy tune, I amble down his driveway and knock on the front door.

I’m jolted by a deep loud barking from inside. No way that tiny poodle is making these sounds. Before I can worry if I’ve got the right place, a clean-shaven thirty-something man in collared shirt and slacks answers the door. Behind him, a brunette in blouse and skirt holds a snarling Boxer by its collar.

“Sorry to bother you,” I say tentatively and a bit confused. “Is that older fellow around? Your dad, maybe?”

He squints. “My folks live in Phoenix.”

“Oh, hers, maybe?” I nod towards the woman, who struggles to keep the growling dog from charging.

The man shakes his head, and I catch a whiff of his piney cologne. “They’re in Denver. What’s this about?”

I figure they’re just being protective. In my kindest voice I ask, “Who’s the elderly man who lives with you?”

He gives me a blank look.

I dry swallow, nervous for some reason. “With the poodle.”

“Sounds like you got the wrong address.” He shrugs. “Sorry, we’re getting ready for work.”

My armpits drip and I’m jittery as if I’ve had too much coffee. Surely, I haven’t been hallucinating. Before he can close the door, I blurt out, “You’re saying an old man with a black poodle doesn’t live here?”

Before he can respond, the woman, who’s finally calmed the Boxer to a low whine, chimes up, “You mean the guy who used to own the place?”

“Used to?” My tense shoulders relax. At least I’m not seeing things. “When was that?”

“We’ve been here almost three years,” she says. “The realtor mentioned him. Guy in his late seventies?”

“That’s him!” I sigh with relief, certain I’ve figured it out. “He still in the neighborhood? I think he’s got dementia and keeps forgetting he doesn’t live here anymore.”

The woman furrows her brow and shakes her head. The Boxer is finally quiet. “He didn’t move. He died.”

“No.” Dizzy, I stagger back a step.

“You can look it up online.” She nods. “Winter of twenty-nineteen, I think. Someone speeding past a stopped school bus almost ran over a couple of kids. At the last second, the guy pushed them out of the way. Got creamed himself. Poor little doggie, too.”

The sky spins, and I rub my eyes until I see stars. That’s when the Boxer breaks free and bolts towards the door. The man slams it in my face just in time.

In a daze, I stumble up the driveway, tripping over my own feet. A ghost. I’ve seen a freaking *ghost*. I threatened to *beat up* a ghost! No wonder the heavy vibes coming from the old guy—he’s dead! Then a chill down my back. And maybe out for revenge…

Nauseous, I pace along staring down at the cracked pavement. If ghosts are real, does that mean there’s an afterlife? A cartoonish image comes to mind of my grandparents dressed in white floating on a cloud.

Does everyone become a ghost, or is it like the books and movies where they have unfinished business? How many are out there? Have I seen others before and not known it? Can everyone see them or just some of us? And what about the poodle? Dogs can be ghosts, too? Can all animals?

Brain boiling like a tea kettle, I reach the top of the hill. Why is this guy haunting *me*, of all people? It’s not like we have any history—before last month I hadn’t even set foot in the neighborhood!

I’m so caught up by the whirlwind of thoughts, I don’t notice I’m in the middle of the street. Not until the red Jeep roars around the blind curve, headed straight for me.",5,1759018741.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1nsai43,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthemoviecalled/comments/1nsai43/girl_in_a_boardinghouse_attic/,Girl in a boardinghouse attic?,"Either and old movie or a period piece, set perhaps 1940s. Could be B&W. A young woman, perhaps early 20s, is being shown to her rented room on the top floor of a rooming house. Perhaps she is on her own for the first time and this was all she could find. It's a tiny dark attic room with a bed, a chair, and a small sink. It's hot as blue blazes up there. She meets the woman in the room next door, a larger, brighter room. The neighbor is a floozy, gay-divorcee type, day-drinking martinis in her slip with the door open and talking about all her boyfriends. The girl rinses out her stockings in the sink and hangs them to dry. At another point she has to go downstairs to take a bath. She is working a menial job for a living. She may have been kicked out of her parents' house?

(I believe this is the same movie): The girl can't sleep in the heat so she goes for a walk at like 4 am. She walks down to the docks where a tackle shop/coffee place for fishermen is just opening. She goes in for a coffee and meets the nice young man that runs the place. She starts to go every day and I think they fall in love eventually.

At the same time, digital marketing seems more essential every year.

For those of you running or working with local businesses:

* What matters most when choosing a digital agency, pricing, technical expertise, cultural understanding, or creativity?
* Do you think there’s still space for newer agencies to partner with small businesses, or are most already tied to larger firms?

I’m building (Ticos Digital) working on these questions, especially around supporting entrepreneurs and the Latin community in Canada. But I’d love to hear honest input from people here about how local businesses approach digital growth.",1,1759018707.0,SmallBusinessCanada,0,1.0,False

I live alone, I have a pretty decent job and make okay money, i’m taking a few classes and i have plans to go back to school soon for something that excites me (i think), but I feel so empty. I have a few friends who were close at one point but we have certainly drifted, i am single, none of my siblings and I are super close, i regularly go an see my grandparents and I love them dearly but it’s about all the social interaction I get outside of work.

I have struggled a lot in the past with anxiety and depression, I actually just recently got placed on an SSRI, however it’s not doing much yet. I have felt so empty lately. Like i am not even sure how to explain it. Like i don’t want to not be alive but also thinking about existing like this for 60 more years is not exactly something that sounds intriguing to me. I try to be there for people but it’s hard when you feel like that treatment is not returned ya know. It’s hard to make friends at this age, I am hopeful when i go back to school I can find a few close friends given the nature of the program but that’s just under two years away.

I just feel like I have a huge hole in my life. I don’t exactly feel sad but I do not feel good either. I spend my days alone at home, i sleep a lot because I don’t have much else to do. I go to work, i do my school work, i see my grandparents, and that’s about it. I try to go get fun coffees and do things that bring me joy but you can only be happy to be alone for so long. I just feel like people my age have friend groups and go out and go on trips and have people they can constantly count on and I just have me. Life just feels like this never ending repetitive cycle of days that are so less than fulfilling for me, and I want nothing less than to continue feeling this way forever. I feel like my life is passing me by and I am just letting it. 

I feel like this is just a word vomit but i’m not sure how else to express how I feel. ",1,1759018689.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False

The incident occurred opposite of the pharmprix ahead of place des Arts. The guy said “no I wanna walk here” but then I denied him because it is my right of way and he walked into my face. The guy proceeded to push me and when I pushed him back he punched me in the face over three times. Luckily, I didn’t  feel any pain but one of my teeth started bleeding. I was wearing a messenger bag and had a cup of coffee which meant I only had one hand to defend myself with but I kept punching back ineffectively with one hand and when he punched me the final time I threw my coffee at him and punched him rapidly till he backed the fuck off. 

To the tattoo artist who checked over me and let me into his shop to check for any injuries, thank you. To the three gentlemen who checked over me, thank you and thank you for helping me find my AirPods which flew away from my ear during the punches. 

The asshole who punched was wearing a blue hoodie jacket, white, probably like 5’10, had an Eastern European accent (not sure) and looks like in his end of 30’s/40’s. I’m a bit worried to report to this police because I defended myself as much as I can and that I heard this has some consequences.

I’ve been dealing with mild antral gastritis since January. Diagnosed via endoscope, h pylori negative. 

This year i’ve been on a very strict diet, with some cheat periods. Completely cut out coffee. I still deal with daily discomfort but my flares seem to be becoming less frequent.

Anyways, what are the positives?

I’ve lost 70 pounds so far this year. I was morbidly obese at the beginning of this year. Bmi 50. Now, I’m about halfway to my target weight now. 
I’m much more active than before, walking ~10k steps a day. I feel great (minus the stomach pain). I sleep good.

Before gastritis, i was a heavy coffee drinker. An espresso aficionado. 4+ shots a day. I was constantly buzzing, constantly on edge
I’ve previously been diagnosed with panic disorder, and agoraphobia. I would have panic attacks any time i left the house. So i was housebound for the past few years.
And the heavy coffee consumption did not help this at all.

Because of being forced to quit coffee, my overall anxiety level has dropped significantly.
Due to my improving confidence from weight loss and lowered anxiety, i can leave my house now. I can drive now. I can go out places now. I still got a long way to go but i’m constantly pushing myself further and being completely sober from coffee has absolutely made this much more easier.

So yeah, there’s been some positives to this dogshit disease. I just wish i coulda gotten my shit together before i was forced to do it because of gastritis.

Panel 3Aishen glances to the side solemnly.

Aishen:""I don’t think you want to hear this part of her heritage.""

J:""...Keep going. I need to understand why she’s acting this way.""

Aishen:""Demon Kitsune, when fully awakened, are no longer themselves. They live in shadows—like vampires. And they can only be killed by one thing…""

Aishen:""Steel. A steel weapon is the only thing that can pierce their power and kill them.""

In early July developed chest pain, primarily a persistent dull ache. Went to my primary care doctor and he ran an ekg, and ordered an echo and ct cardiac scoring. Also referred me to the he cardiologist. EKG detected early beats, echo and cardiac scoring came back with no concerns. Pain went from persistent to occasional, with mostly a minor flare up lasting an hour or 2 once a week about late July through half of September. Pain returned persistent September 15th, right in time for my cardiology appointment on the 24th.

The cardiology appointment:

My cardiologist looks at my reports and I give him the run down. He suspects pericarditis. He prescribed 0.6 colchicine and said to take it as prescribed 3 weeks and it should knock it out. He said if it comes back, refill the script. 

He did not mention any other lifestyle or regimes to beat this thing. He was very not concerned and thought the colch would knock it out no problem. He didn’t mention anything about rest, diet, chance of reoccurrence, which seems to be in conflict with standards (rest, rest rest, avoid flammatory foods, keep heart rate below 100, etc.) discussed on this forum. I left feeling in a celebratory mood thinking I had a cure and of course do my own research and note inconsistency.

In fact he told me coffee was okay. It could increase likelihood of early beats but they are “benign”. I messaged him about exercise and rest and have not heard back yet.

Reason for posting:

Is this a normal approach for this stage? Has anyone else experienced this with the doctor only to find a more strict regime is needed? Any insights would be much appreciated. Thank you!

I am recently doing a lot better and am now taking my brushing and flossing more seriously again. However I have never noticed this spot before and was wondering if it looks like maybe just a stain, as I have been drinking a lot of coffee and soda over the past few months, or if it is something more serious. The spot feels smooth when scratching is with my finger nail or when I run floss over it, and it is not sensitive or sore or painful or anything when I touch it?

We've had our ups and downs as all couples do. But lately I've been feeling distant and often left out or inconsidered. I've communicated this and told him im starting to just feel like more of a sex toy. And thats he only shows up when its convenient for him. He told me, he understands and that hes sorry & made me feel seen. Two days later he completely forgot my 21st birthday, not even a text. After a crap apology over call on my lunchbreak talking about how hes sorry and that ""hes just not good with those things"", he says he loves me and that to ""make it up to me"" he drives us out to a restaurant the next week to buy me dinner. (Something he never does to begin with) where he gets upset with me and doesn't talk to me for half the night. Til he expresses this half baked apology in the middle of the resturaunt talking on how I upset him for assuming that the restaurant we were at was open seating at the bar (As it had been lastime i was there). As badly as i wanted to get pissed about him making whats supposed to be MY 21st MAKEUP dinner about himself. I told him i was sorry and we moved on. As you can imagine it made dinner extremely awkward. Moving on to present day, now this weekend. For context ive been doing horribly, my boss's dog got ran over yesterday, after id thrown a toy into the yard. And he ran off into the road to chase a bird. I still feel partly responsible. and I was a wreck having to carry what was left back to the shop to bury. Later i text him that I need him and that im really not ok, and if he could meet me in a parkinglot of a coffee shop, because i was a wreck and couldnt drive. After about 45minutes or so I get a text back saying hes just out the shower and about to go to bed. Which is fine, but it was 7:30pm.. when he stays out later with his family, often getting back around 10pm. So I ask him to atleast call me because I needed some support. Couple hours later he calls me, and doesn't say hardly anything, except that hes sorry that happened and we leave it. Today he tells me that he took the day off from work, since he was tired. And now Im currently getting pictures and updates from him as hes running around town doing things with his family (not trying to sound crazy or controlling over that stuff ofc, but he makes more effort for them then he ever does me.) Im not responding so I dont say anything ill regret. But it hurts that he knows I've been wanting to hangout. And chooses his family that he sees way more, over time doing those things with me. Knowing that I love running around doing things like that too. Im just really tired and Idk if I have it in me anymore to keep fighting for this. Can I just hear what Im doing wrong here?

1nsa043,https://youtu.be/hKi6QILUD3A,4 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Homestead Renovation Horror Stories,"# ""The Underground"":

I always wanted a quiet life away from the noise of the city. So when my husband John and I found an ad for a cheap piece of land with a rundown cabin in the California mountains, we jumped at it. The place was far from any town, no power lines or water hookups, just trees and dirt roads for miles. We planned to fix it up ourselves, turn it into our own little home where we could grow food and live simple. John was handy with tools, and I handled the planning. We packed our truck and moved in during the spring of 1984.

The cabin needed a lot of work. The roof leaked, the floors creaked, and the walls had holes where animals had gotten in. We started by clearing out the junk inside. Old furniture, rusty cans, even some strange books about surviving the end of the world. John laughed and said it was probably from the last owner who liked to play pioneer. I nodded, but something about the place made me uneasy from the start. The way the trees crowded around, like they were listening.

Our first week, we focused on the main room. John hammered new boards into the floor while I painted the walls. ""This is going to be great,"" he said one afternoon, wiping sweat from his face. ""Imagine sitting here with a fire going, no bills, no bosses."" I smiled and agreed, but I kept glancing out the window. The land sloped down to a ravine, and beyond that was another property, hidden by brush. I thought I saw smoke rising from there once or twice, like someone else was out here.

A few days later, a man showed up at our door. He was in his forties, with a beard and a calm smile, carrying a toolbox. ""Name's Len,"" he said. ""I live over the hill. Saw your truck coming in and figured you might need help with the fixes."" John shook his hand right away. ""Perfect timing,"" John replied. ""We're drowning in work here. You know anything about plumbing?"" Len nodded. ""Built my whole place myself. Even added a storage room underground for supplies. Off-grid life takes planning."" I stood back, watching. Len's eyes lingered on me a bit too long, but I pushed the thought away. We needed the help.

Len started coming over every day. He helped John dig a new well and fix the roof. He talked a lot about how the world was falling apart, how people needed to prepare. ""You two are smart to get out here,"" he said one evening as we sat around a small fire outside. The flames lit his face in flickers. ""Cities are traps. Out here, you control your fate."" John liked his stories, but I noticed little things. Len would stare at our tools, ask where we got them. Once, I caught him looking through our truck when he thought no one was around. ""Just checking for leaks,"" he said when I asked. His smile didn't reach his eyes.

As the weeks went on, we made progress. The cabin looked better, with fresh paint and sturdy floors. But strange things happened. Tools went missing, then showed up in odd places. One night, I woke to a scraping sound outside, like metal on dirt. John slept through it, but I peeked out the window and saw a shadow moving toward Len's property. The next morning, I told John. ""Probably an animal,"" he said. ""Or Len working late. He's got that big project going."" Len had mentioned building an extension to his cabin, something secure for storage. He invited us over to see it, but we hadn't gone yet.

One afternoon, Len came over with another man, younger, with short hair and a quiet way about him. ""This is Charlie,"" Len introduced. ""My partner in the build. He's good with concrete."" Charlie didn't say much, just nodded and got to work helping John reinforce the walls. I offered them water, and Charlie looked at me with flat eyes. ""Nice place you got,"" he said softly. ""Private."" Something in his voice made my skin prickle. Later, when they left, I told John I didn't like Charlie. ""He seems off."" John shrugged. ""They're just neighbors helping out. We can't be picky out here.""

The unease grew. I started noticing tire tracks near our land that weren't ours. One day, while John and Len were working on the porch, I walked down to the ravine to gather wood. I crossed onto Len's side without thinking and saw his cabin up close. It was bigger than ours, with a new concrete structure attached, like a low building half-buried in the hill. A door led inside, padlocked. As I turned back, Charlie stepped out from the trees. ""You shouldn't wander,"" he said, his face blank. ""Could get lost."" I mumbled an apology and hurried away. That night, I whispered to John, ""We should finish the work ourselves. I don't trust them."" John hugged me. ""You're worrying too much. A couple more days, and we'll be done.""

But the next morning, John was gone. His side of the bed was cold, and his boots were missing. I called his name around the cabin, then outside. No answer. Panic rose in my chest. I grabbed a flashlight and headed to Len's place. The door to his cabin was open a crack. ""Len? Have you seen John?"" I pushed inside. The room was dim, cluttered with boxes and papers. On a table, I saw a video camera, wires tangled. Then I heard voices from the back, low and muffled.

I followed the sound to a hallway, my hands shaking. The voices grew clearer—John's voice, scared. ""What is this? Let me go!"" I reached a door and opened it quietly. Steps led down to the underground room Len had mentioned. At the bottom, in a concrete cell, John was tied to a chair, his face bruised. Len stood over him, holding a knife. Charlie watched from the corner, arms crossed. ""Your wife will join soon,"" Len said calmly. ""We need help with our project. Permanent help.""

My breath caught. I backed up, but my foot hit a loose board. It creaked loud. Len turned. ""Who's there?"" I ran, heart racing, up the steps and out the cabin. Footsteps pounded behind me. I darted into the woods, branches scratching my arms. ""Come back!"" Len called, his voice echoing. ""We just want to talk!"" I hid behind a thick tree, holding my breath as they searched. Charlie passed close, muttering, ""She can't go far.""

Hours passed before I dared move. I circled back to our truck, keys still in it. The engine roared to life, and I sped down the dirt road, dust flying. At the nearest town, I burst into the police station, words tumbling out. ""My husband—they have him—please help!"" The officers looked skeptical at first, but they followed me back.

What they found changed everything. In Len's underground room, a bunker he had built during his ""renovations,"" they discovered horrors. Tapes showing women begging, men screaming. Bones buried in the yard. John was alive, barely, locked in a cell. Len and Charlie had lured people like us, promising jobs or help, then trapped them. They killed for sport, for control. Police said there were more victims, families even, vanished without trace.

John and I got out, but the fear never left. Every creak in our new home, every stranger's face, reminds me. That cabin we wanted to fix? It was too close to hell.





# ""The Last Day"":

I had been living in Klamath County for a few years when I met Ted. He was the kind of guy who knew how to make things work with what he had. We bonded over building projects. He lived up on Bly Mountain, in a small spot off the grid—two acres with no electricity from the city, just solar panels and a generator he fixed himself. His place was basic, a cabin he built from logs he milled, with horses grazing nearby and dogs running around. Ted loved those animals more than most people love their kids. He had three horses and a pack of dogs that followed him everywhere.

Last spring, Ted asked for help renovating his cabin. He wanted to add a room for storage and fix the roof that leaked every rain. ""I can't do it alone,"" he said over the phone. ""My back's not what it used to be."" I agreed because I liked the work, and it gave me an excuse to get away from town. The area up there was quiet, but not the good kind. People kept to themselves, and some were into bad stuff like cooking meth in trailers hidden in the woods. Ted mentioned it once or twice, but he said as long as you didn't bother them, they left you alone.

I drove up there on a Wednesday morning in May. The road was dirt, full of potholes that jarred my truck. Ted's truck was parked near the cabin, like always. I called out his name as I got out, but no answer. His dogs usually barked when someone approached, but everything was still. I walked toward the cabin, tools in hand, thinking he might be out back with the horses.

Then I saw one of his dogs lying on the ground near the truck. It was his favorite, a big shepherd mix named Buddy. The dog wasn't moving. I knelt down and saw the blood on its side. It had been shot. My hands shook as I touched its fur. It was cold. I stood up fast, looking around. The woods were thick, trees close together, and I felt eyes on me. ""Ted!"" I yelled louder. No response.

I moved to the truck. The door was open, and Ted's keys were still in the ignition. His phone was on the seat, screen cracked. Then I saw him. He was on the ground a few feet away, face down in the dirt. Blood pooled around his head. I ran over and turned him. His eyes were open, blank. A gunshot wound on his chest. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. I backed away, my mind racing. Who did this? Why?

I grabbed my phone to call the sheriff, but signal was spotty up there. I had to drive down the road a bit to get bars. While I waited for the cops, I remembered our talks. A week earlier, we were fixing the roof. Ted hammered nails while I held the ladder. ""You notice anything odd lately?"" he asked.

""Like what?"" I said.

""Tools going missing. And last night, I heard someone walking around outside. The dogs barked like crazy.""

I laughed it off then. ""Probably deer or a coyote.""

He shook his head. ""No, it was footsteps. Human. And one of my trail cameras is gone. The one facing the road.""

I didn't think much of it at the time. Ted was always cautious, but the area had its share of drifters. People who lived off-grid like him, but not all were friendly. Some stole to get by, or worse. Ted told me about a neighbor a mile away who got into fights over land lines. ""He's jealous of my setup,"" Ted said. ""Thinks I have more than I do.""

We took a break that day, sitting on the porch with coffee from his camp stove. His dogs played in the yard. ""You know, I built this place for peace,"" he said. ""Away from the world. But sometimes, the world finds you anyway.""

I nodded. ""Yeah, but you have the horses. The dogs. Your kids visit.""

He smiled. ""True. My daughter bought this land for me. Kept me from ending up on the street. I make tables for the grocery store in town. They give me food in trade. It's enough.""

That conversation stuck with me as I sat in my truck waiting for the police. The sheriff's office arrived after what felt like forever—two deputies in a SUV. They asked questions. ""When did you last see him alive?""

""Yesterday,"" I said. ""We were working on the addition. He seemed fine.""

They looked around, took photos. ""Looks like he was ambushed,"" one said. ""Shot close range. Dogs too.""

I told them about the missing tools, the footsteps Ted mentioned. They noted it down, but their faces were grim. ""This area's rough,"" the other deputy said. ""Meth heads, thieves. We'll investigate.""

Later, they found another dog shot but alive. It had a bullet in its face. Ted's family took it to the vet, and it survived after surgery. But Buddy didn't make it. The horses were okay, but spooked.

The days after were hard. I went back to Ted's place with his family to clean up. That's when we saw the looting. Someone had come in the night after the murder. Ted's lumber mill was gone. His flatbed trailer, horse tack, even antlers he collected—stolen. A bear rug from his cabin, missing. ""Neighbors,"" his daughter said, angry. ""The off-grid ones. They wait for moments like this.""

We talked as we packed his things. ""Dad mentioned someone watching him,"" she said. ""He thought it was that guy down the road. The one with the meth lab rumors.""

I recalled Ted pointing out the trail to that neighbor's place. ""Stay away from there,"" he warned me once. ""Bad news.""

The family offered a cash reward for info. I spread the word in town. People whispered theories. ""Meth addicts looking for easy cash."" ""Jealousy over his land."" ""Someone he knew, since they took the trail camera—didn't want to be seen.""

I started feeling uneasy at my own place. Nights, I heard branches snap outside. Was it wind? Animals? Or someone? I locked my doors tighter, kept a light on. Ted's death changed how I saw the mountain. What was peaceful now felt threatening. The woods hid too much.

One night, a week later, I got a call from an unknown number. A man's voice, low. ""You asking about Ted?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Who is this?""

""He stuck his nose where it didn't belong. Mind your business, or end up like him.""

The line went dead. I called the sheriff, but they said it was probably a prank. But I knew better. The killer was still out there, watching.

I helped finish the renovation for Ted's family. We added the room, fixed the roof. It was our way to honor him. But every hammer strike reminded me of him. His laugh, his stories about his grandkids. He planned to take them fishing.

Now, months later, the case is still open. No arrests. The mountain keeps its secrets. I drive by his place sometimes, see the cabin standing empty. The horses are with his daughter. The surviving dog too. But the quiet up there? It's not peaceful anymore. It's waiting.

I think about that voice on the phone. The footsteps Ted heard. The eyes in the woods. Living off-grid sounded free once. Now, it feels like a trap. Ted was kind, generous. Gave me a propane tank last winter when mine ran low. ""Friends help friends,"" he said.

I miss him. And I wonder who's next.





# ""No Signal"":

My boyfriend Ray had this idea one weekend. He said we should drive out to that weird place in the woods where those two older guys lived. Ray knew them a little from hunting trips. He called it a chance to relax and have some fun away from town. I was nineteen then, and it sounded exciting at first. Ray's friend Kenny came along, and so did Kenny's nephew Tim. We piled into Kenny's old truck and headed up the dirt road that twisted through the hills. The trees got thicker the farther we went, and soon the pavement was gone. It took almost an hour to reach the spot.

When we arrived, the house looked like something built by hand, all brick and sturdy, but simple. No power lines ran to it, no neighbors for miles. The two men who lived there, Dr. Henry Lawson and his friend James Ellis, had made it themselves a few years back. They left the city to live off the land, growing their own food and using well water. I heard they were still adding to it, fixing up outbuildings and expanding the garden. Henry was a former professor, smart and quiet, with a kind face. James was more outgoing, always ready with a smile. They had two big dogs, mastiffs named Duke and Rex, who barked when we pulled up but wagged their tails once Henry called them off.

Henry came out to greet us. ""Hello there,"" he said, his voice calm and polite. ""What brings you all this way?""

Kenny grinned and held up a six-pack. ""Just thought we'd stop by, see if you folks want company. Maybe share a drink?""

Henry glanced at James, who nodded from the doorway. ""Sure, come on in. We've got some homemade wine if you're interested.""

We followed them inside. The place was cozy, with a wood stove in the corner and shelves full of books and jars of preserved vegetables. No TV, no radio—just the sound of our footsteps on the wooden floor. The dogs settled by the stove, watching us. We sat around the table, and James poured the wine. It was sweet, made from their own grapes. We talked about nothing much at first. Henry mentioned how they built the house brick by brick, how it took months to get the walls just right for insulation against the cold. ""We're thinking of adding a greenhouse next,"" he said. ""Make it easier to grow through winter.""

Ray leaned back in his chair. ""Must be nice out here, no bills, no boss telling you what to do.""

James laughed softly. ""It has its moments. But it's work. Always something to fix or build.""

As the afternoon wore on, Kenny suggested we move to the outbuilding they called the coop. It was three stories tall, with chickens on the bottom, storage in the middle, and a room up top for hanging out. We climbed a long ladder to get there—forty feet straight up. The room was painted pink, with cushions and a small table. More wine flowed. Ray and Kenny started sniffing some stuff they brought, a mix of chemicals that made their eyes glaze over. Henry and James stuck to the wine, chatting about life in the city versus the woods.

I felt uneasy as the light outside dimmed. The isolation hit me—the nearest road was far, and my phone had no signal. Tim kept glancing at me, like he sensed something off too. Kenny's laughs got louder, his eyes sharper. He pulled Ray aside at one point, whispering. I caught bits: ""They got money hidden... look at all this...""

James noticed the shift. ""Everything alright?"" he asked, his tone still friendly but watchful.

""Yeah, just fine,"" Kenny replied, too quick.

Then it happened fast. Kenny excused himself, said he needed something from the truck. When he came back, he had a rifle tucked under his arm. No one said a word at first. He climbed the ladder, sat down, and suddenly pointed it at James. ""Don't move,"" he growled.

James's face went pale. ""What is this? We don't have much—""

Kenny fired. Four shots, loud in the small space. James slumped over, blood spreading on his shirt. I screamed, backing against the wall. Henry jumped up, but Ray grabbed him, twisting his arms behind his back. ""Tie him up,"" Ray ordered Tim, who looked terrified but did it with some rope from the corner.

The dogs downstairs barked wildly. Kenny went down and shot them too—sharp cracks that echoed up. I couldn't breathe right. ""Why are you doing this?"" I cried at Ray.

""Shut up, Lisa,"" Ray snapped. ""They've got cash stashed. We're taking it.""

Henry struggled against the ropes. ""Please, we don't have anything valuable. Just let us go.""

Kenny rummaged through drawers, tossing things aside. ""Where's the money, doc? We know you're loaded from that city job.""

Henry shook his head. ""We spent it all building this place. There's nothing.""

Tim and I tried to slip away then. We climbed down the ladder quiet as we could, ran to the truck. But the engine wouldn't turn over—something wrong with it. Kenny heard the noise and came running. ""Get back here!"" He dragged us inside the main house now, where James lay still upstairs.

They pushed Henry to his knees in the living room. Ray paced, frustrated. They'd torn apart cabinets and shelves, found only a few dollars and some jewelry. ""You're lying,"" Ray said to Henry. ""Tell us or it's over.""

Henry looked right at me, his eyes pleading. ""Help me,"" he whispered.

I shook, tears running down my face. ""Ray, stop this. Let's just leave.""

But Ray raised the gun, pressed it to Henry's head. ""Last chance.""

Henry closed his eyes. ""There's a box under the floorboard in the bedroom. Small savings.""

Kenny ran up, pried up the board, pulled out a metal box. Inside, maybe a thousand dollars. Not enough for them. Ray's face twisted in anger. He pulled the trigger. The shot rang out, and Henry fell forward.

I collapsed, sobbing. Tim stared at the floor, silent.

They grabbed what they could— the money, some tools, Henry's jeep keys. ""We're out of here,"" Kenny said. But the truck was dead, so they took the jeep. Ray forced me and Tim into the back. We drove through the dark woods, the branches scraping the sides like fingers.

At a gas station hours later, they argued. ""What do we do with them?"" Kenny asked Ray.

""Keep 'em quiet till we figure it out,"" Ray said.

They dropped me and Tim at Tim's mom's house the next day, warning us not to talk. ""You say anything, you're next,"" Ray told me.

Tim locked me in a room, said it was for my own good. Days passed—I lost track. I heard them on the phone, planning to run farther. One night, Ray and Kenny left for Mississippi. Tim fell asleep downstairs. I pried open the window, climbed out, and ran to the road. Flagged down a car, told the driver to take me to the police.

When the sheriff went to the homestead, they found the bodies. James in the pink room, Henry in the living room, the dogs by the stove. The place was ransacked, blood everywhere. They caught Ray and Kenny soon after—they'd killed another man at a rest stop, stealing his car. Trials followed, life sentences.

I still see their faces, hear the shots. That off-grid dream they built turned into a nightmare because of greed and hate. I moved away, but the memory follows me.





# ""Hollow Hours"":

I bought this rundown farm in Woodruff because it came cheap at auction. Ninety-five acres of woods and fields, with a house that needed everything fixed—new roof, plumbing, the works. I wanted to make it my own spot, away from people, with rain catchers and wind turbines for power. No more relying on the grid or noisy neighbors. The real estate guy who handled the sale, a man named Carl, seemed eager to close the deal. He was polished, drove a nice car, but his eyes darted around like he had places to be.

""Property's got potential,"" Carl said as we walked the land that first day. He pointed to the barn and outbuildings. ""Previous owner let it go, but you could turn this into something special. Hunt, farm, whatever.""

I nodded, kicking at the overgrown grass. ""That's the plan. Start with the house, then build a greenhouse. How long was it empty?""

He shrugged. ""Couple years. Owner moved on. Died or something. Papers are clean, though.""

I signed and moved in the next week. Unloaded my truck with tools, lumber, and seeds. The house was two stories, creaky stairs, rooms full of dust. Out back, a metal shipping container sat half-buried in weeds, padlocked. I figured it for storage, planned to clean it out later.

First few days, I tore out rotten floorboards in the kitchen, ran new wires for lights. Worked from dawn till dark. One afternoon, a pickup pulled up. A local farmer, older guy named Ben, got out with a basket of eggs.

""Welcome to the area,"" Ben said, handing it over. ""Saw the lights on. Thought you'd like some fresh ones.""

""Thanks,"" I replied. ""Name's Alex. Fixing the place up.""

He looked past me at the house. ""Big job. That container out back—ever open it?""

""Not yet. Why?""

Ben shifted his feet. ""Just curious. Last owner kept odd stuff. Kept to himself mostly.""

I laughed it off. ""I'll get to it. Appreciate the eggs.""

He drove away, but his words stuck. That night, I pried the lock off the container with bolt cutters. Inside, chains bolted to the floor, a bucket in the corner, stains on the walls. Smelled like rust and something sour. I backed out quick, locked it again. Maybe an animal pen, I thought. Or worse.

Next morning, I called Carl about it. ""Hey, what's with the shipping container? Looks like someone used it for holding... I don't know, livestock?""

He paused on the phone. ""Probably. Old owner was into prepping. Stored gear there. Clean it out if it bothers you.""

""Alright,"" I said. ""Just seemed strange.""

""Everything's fine. Call if you need referrals for work.""

I hung up, but doubt crept in. Kept working—installed solar panels on the roof, dug trenches for water lines. The land was quiet, trees thick around the edges. Sometimes I'd find dug spots in the dirt, like holes filled back in. Blamed moles or deer.

A week later, while clearing brush near the woods, I hit metal with my shovel. Dug around it—a motorcycle part, rusted chain. Nearby, more scraps: a wallet, empty, leather cracked. Inside flap had initials carved: S.M. I pocketed it, figured junk from years ago.

That evening, Ben stopped by again, this time with tools. ""Heard you're renovating solo. Need a hand?""

""Sure,"" I said. We hammered siding on the barn. As we worked, I mentioned the finds. ""Dug up some old bike parts. Wallet too.""

Ben stopped hammering. ""Where?""

""Edge of the woods.""

His face paled a bit. ""Might want to leave that be. Rumors about this land.""

""What kind?""

He wiped his brow. ""Missing folks. Couples, mostly. Vanished around here years back. Police searched once, found nothing.""

I set my hammer down. ""You serious?""

""Yeah. One pair, engaged, disappeared after a bike shop job. Others too. Never solved.""

I showed him the wallet. He looked it over. ""S.M.... Could be Scott Meeks. One of the missing.""

We called the sheriff. A deputy came out, took the wallet, asked questions. ""We'll look into it. Stay out of the woods for now.""

After he left, I couldn't settle. Paced the house, checked doors. That night, heard scratching from outside—faint, like nails on metal. Went to the window, saw nothing. But the container door swung open slightly, chain loose.

I grabbed a flashlight and crowbar, went out. Pushed the door wider. Empty, same as before. But fresh marks on the floor, like drag lines. Back inside, I barred the front door with a chair.

Days blurred. I focused on the greenhouse build—framed it, added plastic sheeting. Carl called once. ""How's the progress? Need anything?""

""Fine,"" I said short. ""Found some stuff in the dirt. Police involved now.""

Silence. ""What stuff?""

""Wallet. Bike parts.""

He cleared his throat. ""Coincidence. Old land holds secrets. Don't let it stop you.""

His tone felt forced. I hung up, searched online about the missing people. Articles popped up: Superbike Motors murders in 2003—four killed in a shop. Then couples vanishing: Johnny and Megan Coxie in 2015, Charles and Kala in 2016. Bodies found on a local property. Wait—property description matched mine. Owner arrested: Carl's full name in the headlines.

My hands shook. Carl was the killer. Real estate front, but he used this land as his dump site. Chained a woman in that container for months. Buried victims in shallow graves.

I packed essentials, called the deputy. ""It's him. The owner—Carl. This is his killing ground.""

Deputy's voice sharpened. ""Stay put. We're coming.""

But as I waited, headlights cut the dark. Carl's car pulled up. He got out, casual, toolbox in hand. ""Heard you had trouble. Thought I'd help.""

I backed from the window, phone dead—signal gone. He knocked. ""Open up. We need to talk.""

Knocking turned to pounding. I ran upstairs, hid in a closet. Heard the door splinter. Footsteps below, slow, searching.

""Found my old spots, huh?"" he called. ""Smart. But too late.""

Steps on stairs. I held my breath, gripped a loose board. Door creaked open. His shadow filled the room.

Police sirens wailed distant, growing louder. He cursed soft, retreated. Car engine roared away.

Cops arrived, searched the land. Dug up bodies—seven total. Carl caught later, confessed. I sold the place quick, never looked back. But echoes of those chains rattle in my mind still.",1,1759017192.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

In the evening I vomited twice, despite not eating all day due to the pain, which looked like coffee grounds.

Partner took me to the ER and all they said was that my WBC was just barely high and that my CT showed a bit of free fluid in my pelvis which could be from ovulation.


Doctor said this sounds like food poisoning or a stomach virus, but I only vomited once due to pain and my main symptom is the severe back pain, which today, has spread into my pelvis. I do have a history of cysts on my ovaries and I'm weeks past ovulation. I'm worried this is a ruptured ovarian cyst.

1ns9xxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1ns9xxi/these_are_the_top_nutrient_deficiencies_that_most/,These are the top nutrient deficiencies that most people have and significantly shortens their lifespan. Make sure you get these to not die early.,"Did you know that even people living in modern, wealthy countries are quietly suffering from dangerous nutrient deficiencies? You might feel tired, moody, or forgetful and never realize your body is missing the very building blocks that keep it strong and alive. These silent shortages aren’t just about how you feel today. They slowly wear you down, aging your cells, weakening your organs, and eventually cutting your life short. But there’s something empowering in knowing this: you can change it. You can take control of your health, feel better, and live longer. Just by giving your body what it’s really asking for.

One of the most common and overlooked deficiencies is vitamin D. It’s not just for strong bones: it’s crucial for your immune system, mood, and protection against serious diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. If you rarely get sun, have darker skin, or spend most of your time indoors, you’re likely running low. Step outside for 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight a day, and if that’s not an option, consider a D3 + K2 supplement to get your blood levels into the healthy range.

Magnesium is another key player your body craves daily. It’s involved in hundreds of processes, from your heartbeat and sleep cycle to stress management and DNA repair. If you’re feeling anxious, having trouble sleeping, or living off coffee and fast food, chances are you’re low. You can start rebuilding your levels with leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, avocados, or a magnesium glycinate supplement, which is gentle and effective.

Then there are omega-3 fatty acids, the golden fats your brain and heart love. These powerful anti-inflammatory nutrients are mostly found in wild-caught fish like salmon and sardines. Unfortunately, most people eat too many seed oils and not enough fish, creating a harmful imbalance in the body. If you want a sharper mind and a younger heart, aim for fatty fish a few times a week or take a good-quality fish oil or algae-based alternative if you’re plant-based.

Don’t forget about vitamin B12, the brain booster that helps you think clearly, stay energized, and keep your nerves healthy. It’s especially critical for vegans, vegetarians, and older adults. If you often feel tired, foggy, or weak, B12 could be the missing link. Try including eggs, liver, or beef in your meals, or supplement with methylcobalamin for a more active, absorbable form.

Zinc is your body’s repair crew. It keeps your immune system strong, helps your body heal wounds, and even supports your hormones. If you eat a lot of grains, avoid meat, or drink alcohol often, your zinc levels may be running on empty. Pumpkin seeds, lentils, beef, and oysters can help you bounce back, or try a short-term zinc supplement to reboot your immune power.

Iodine is easy to forget, but your thyroid absolutely depends on it to run your metabolism and brain function. Low iodine can leave you sluggish, foggy, and gaining weight for no obvious reason. If you avoid iodized salt or skip seafood, you could be missing out. Just a little seaweed like nori or a sprinkle of iodized salt can make a big difference. But don’t overdo it either.

Iron is vital, especially for women. It’s what carries oxygen through your blood and keeps your body running. If you feel cold all the time, lose hair, or crash midday, iron could be the reason. It’s especially important if you have heavy periods, follow a plant-based diet, or have stomach issues. Lean meat, spinach, and lentils are great choices: pair them with vitamin C-rich foods for better absorption. And if blood tests show you’re low, a gentle iron supplement can safely restore your levels.

Lastly, there’s choline, the hidden hero for memory, brain function, and liver health. It helps your body produce acetylcholine, a key messenger in the brain. Most people who avoid eggs or meat don’t get enough. You can support your brain by eating pastured eggs, liver, or fatty fish. Or supplement with citicoline or alpha-GPC, especially if you want a mental edge.

Your body is a masterpiece in motion. But it can’t thrive if it’s missing essential nutrients. These aren’t just tips. They’re lifelines. When you nourish yourself right, your body rewards you with energy, clarity, resilience, and more years to live fully. So fuel your future. Don’t wait for illness to show you what was missing. Give your body what it needs, and it will carry you farther than you ever thought possible.",100,1759017009.0,immortalists,4,0.98,False

My partner constantly complains about spending money, they have a horrible case of financial anxiety, so we don’t go on dates or go to many events, yet they’ll go out whenever friends or family invite them & I am usually having to pay half. I don’t mind contributing, but I’d love to be treated to dinner once in a while. I’ve told them how important it is to me that we share activities, even if it’s not their thing, since I do the same for them (going out drinking, watching sports, listening to endless talk about UFC & soccer). But when it comes to what I enjoy, like ceramics, concerts, or paint nights, they either say it’s not something they are into or act miserable the entire time we are doing it, which makes me feel like they just don’t want to make me happy. Anytime we do go out, it’s never just the two of us, it usually becomes an event that they invite friends or family to. I would like to say that I’m a very kindhearted person, even if I’m sad or hurt, I’ll still go out of my way to try to make them feel special or loved. 

When I bring this up, they twist it back on me, accusing me of wanting money or “them to buy me things.” They’ve even called me a gold digger, which is insulting given that I pay my half of the mortgage, bills, groceries, & dinners, & never ask them for extras. The only things I’ve ever wanted are small gestures, like a nice dinner, flowers, or some genuine effort to do something that I really enjoy. Meanwhile, they regularly ask me to cover both of us, & I usually do. I know for a fact if I asked this of them, it would turn into a fight. They have told me that me asking for flowers or dates so often makes the idea of doing such “not desirable”. They use the excuse that we share locations, so they can’t go somewhere to surprise me (I hardly ever check their location, only if I haven’t heard from them in an extended period of time & I want to make sure they are okay, that happens MAYBE once a month?). It just feels like excuses to not go out of their way for me. I even bring THEM flowers! I started doing this regularly in hopes that it would start happening to me too, it hasn’t. I also regularly get the excuse that we live together, so we “are always spending quality time together”. 

What hurts most is the hypocrisy. They spend freely on golf every week, but claim we can’t afford a night out for us. I don’t want their money, I want to feel valued and cared for. I want to feel like they want to celebrate me, to celebrate our relationship, to take care of me. Right now, it feels one-sided, & that leaves me feeling sad, frustrated, & unloved. Am I being superficial? I mentioned to them that my previous partners always made small gestures to show me that they were thinking of me, like getting me a coffee, flowers, surprise dates, etc. & it turned into a fight about me “comparing them to my past”. I understand how that can be hurtful & I apologized, but I feel like I have a legitimate reason to feel the way that I do. Maybe I am being selfish, but damn, it really hurts my feelings.

Let’s rewind to about 4-5 years ago: life was a total blur — work, training, racing... repeat. I was still competing at a high level in Duathlon and honestly didn’t notice much change in performance, so I brushed off the weird periods, mega cramps, and gnarly back pain as “normal.” (Thanks to all the docs over the years who told me exactly that. 🙃)

But then... it escalated. Fast. I couldn't sleep. Hot flashes? Try hot infernos. I was bringing *two* outfit changes to work just to survive the day. My brain fog was so bad I couldn’t remember basic words. And the worst one: crippling anxiety that came out of *nowhere*.  
  
After my primary and OB-GYN both basically shrugged and told me to ""try some black cohosh,"" I was done. Like, **DONE** done. No one mentioned hormones or even tried to dig deeper.

Enter: **Midi Health** 🎉

A client of mine introduced me to a close friend for some work-related stuff — turns out, that friend just happened to be Midi’s President/co-founder. After we got to talking about women’s health, I didn’t even wait to check if insurance would cover it — I just booked the appointment. Best impulsive decision ever.  
  
Right off the bat, my clinician didn’t just throw a plan at me — she asked me what *my goals* were. She had already reviewed my intake forms (a miracle in itself), but instead of going straight to recommendations, she said: **“Do you know what you want to do, or should we talk through all your options?”** Options?! What a concept!

I started with the estrogen patch + progesterone pill combo. Within **days**, my hot flashes dropped from nearly a dozen daily to just 1 or 2 — and they were way less intense. A few months later, a full blood panel showed I also needed B12, D3/K2, Iodine, and Omega-3. With that full plan in place, I started to feel like myself again within 6 months.

It’s now been a year on hormones. We’ve tweaked the estrogen dose a couple of times, and I love that my clinician treats **me and my symptoms**, not just some outdated medical playbook. Brain fog still creeps in sometimes (usually at *the worst* moments), and the anxiety? Still lingering. So when Midi launched their supplement line, I jumped on it.

# Enter: Midi Supplements 🔥

They rolled out 3 products: **Fiber Gummies**, **Daily Cortisol Support, and Daily Brain Boost.** I went straight for the **Cortisol Support**. After *just one dose*, I slept like a rock and woke up **calm** — like, *actually calm* — for the first time in forever. Even my 45-minute stress-inducing commute didn’t get to me.

BUT — after a week on the full dose, I felt a bit groggy in the mornings. So I played around with timing and dosage. Eventually, I realized: I’m a smaller human, maybe I just don’t need as much. Boom. Problem solved. I’m now sleeping great *and* waking up clear-headed — no grogginess, no jittery need for that second cup of coffee. (Though I still drink it for the vibe ☕)

Next up: **Daily Brain Boost** This one has B12, CoQ10, and Choline. Within a week or so, I noticed I was recovering faster from workouts and had way less muscle soreness. Seriously game-changing stuff — and I don’t say that lightly.

I love that Midi's supplements are made by women, for women — and *tested* on women actually going through this stuff. They’re not just slapping together some trendy ingredients to make a buck. They genuinely care about helping us feel better.

As a **rehab specialist and endurance sport coach**, I work with tons of middle-aged women dealing with similar struggles. I’ve started referring all of them to Midi, and almost every single one has reported feeling better within the first month.

# Final Thoughts

1ns9f14,https://i.redd.it/k5klmp43ksrf1.jpeg,Protein Drinks,"  My Research on Protein Drinks (Ranking + Thoughts)

Disclaimer: My taste buds are picky. I cannot stand that chalky protein flavor, so I lean toward hydrolyzed whey or clear proteins. I’m also not a super sweet person. I love dessert, but I get overwhelmed fast if a drink is too sugary or cloying.

I’ve been trying out a ton of protein drinks, and here’s my breakdown of which are worth it and which are not. I thought this might help someone other than me. 


---

🥤 The Ones I Recommend:

Clean & Simple (Energy) Coastal Punch [90 cals]

Sun Kissed Peach was a miss for me. A lot of their flavors are hit or miss.

**not energy but also enjoyed the Prickly Pear though dragon fruit not great 


Protean (tea based protein drinks) [45 cals]

Love these since I’m a tea person. Flavors ranked best to worst:

1. Lemon


2. Peach


3. Green


4. Hibiscus




Spylt [90 cals]

Cookies & Cream

Vanilla

Strawberry

Chocolate

Peanut Butter + Chocolate (weirdly bad even though I love Reese’s)


Slate Ultra Protein [130 cals]

Chocolate (closest thing to Fairlife chocolate milk but with 3x the protein) 

Vanilla

Haven’t tried Salted Caramel yet


Honorable Mentions (taste good but too high cal for me)

Chobani Strawberries & Cream

Fairlife 32g Protein (chalky and calorie heavy)



---

🚫 Drinks I’ve Tried and Wouldn’t Recommend:

Premier Protein – okay as a coffee or chai mixer, not great solo

Fairlife (regular) – tasty but calorie heavy

Nuuri – Slate Ultra Protein tastes better

Protein2O – has that off protein flavor

Isopure (Blue Raspberry) – big no

Pure Protein – borderline undrinkable

Quest Iced Coffee and Milkshakes – chemical taste and way too sweet

Bucked Up Carbonated Protein – carbonation inconsistent and artificial. Flavors ranked:

1. Peach Mango

2. Orange Cream

3. Rainbow Candy

4. Banana Pineapple



Alani Nu – meh macros, taste got overwhelming fast

Ryse – horrid, tastes chemical and bitter (both Key Lime and Lemonade were awful)



---

TL;DR

Best overall: Slate Ultra Protein (Chocolate) if you want something like Fairlife but with better protein
Best tea based option: Protean Lemon
Best dessert like option: Spylt Cookies & Cream
Best fruity/soda esque option: Clean & Simple Coastal Punch

Everything else ranges from “eh” to “don’t bother.”


---

That’s my list so far. Please drop your favorite protein drink suggestions, I’d love to try some new ones.

In July, I bought Vanilla Cafe mist and body cream; eventually, I picked up a butter at the TBC.

Since its release, I have developed an appreciation for Milk & ended up buying the Espresso mist. Now, I’m wondering if maybe this was the move I should’ve made originally.

Using the store samples, I’ve test worn Vanilla Cafe and I do like it, though there’s a hazelnut note that’s pretty prominent and I’m not sure what I think about it to be honest. I like this scent better when I combine it.

I’m looking at my current holdings, and then they released Whipped Honey & Vanilla which is a true win to me! and I’m thinking that maybe… Vanilla Cafe is good but maybe I should make a different choice given the way the drops ended up happening and my preferences.

For the first time I applied the body butter this evening. I’m beginning to think that maybe I should return the cream and mist, or swap it for Twisted Peppermint when it drops. I don’t need more scents, and after TP, I have a full 4-seasons of fragrance in my home and I really should focus on using my stash which has so many things I like (and picked up over the past 10 months).

Wondering if folks have been using the Vanilla Cafe body butter and combining it with the other coffee or creamy scents? Is that working? Do I really need the mist??…

Should I follow my bliss…

Then I’m like, maybe this is a chance to swap the unusued mist & cream for something I will definitely use & not spend additional money in the process? I’ve got my receipt… and money is tight.

Fictional sorry, might have been a Harlequin romance novel…. The cover had a dark haired man and a blondish woman holding each other, but was a drawing, not a “real” picture per se, and the left side of the paperback book was purple, I think!!!

A fictional love story about a playwright named Eric Thorne and a doctor/psychologist (possibly) named Aurora Vance. Eric has a daughter whose mother took her own life jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. 

Oddly enough AI Overview could find this when I googled keywords but couldn’t provide a name for the book or author: 

Eric, a playwright of avant-garde reputation, believed in the visceral, the unscripted. His plays were sparse on plot but rich with emotional intensity, often performed in found spaces—an abandoned warehouse, a decommissioned ferry. His personal life, however, was a meticulously scripted affair of casual relationships and late-night solitude, a defense mechanism against the unpredictable chaos he courted on stage.
His carefully constructed world began to unravel with a paper cut. A ridiculously small, insignificant cut on his index finger while flipping through a dog-eared script. The cut, however, became infected, and soon, his hand swelled to the size of a catcher's mitt. At the insistence of his theater company, he reluctantly ended up in the antiseptic quiet of a doctor's office.
There, he met Dr. Aurora Vance. She was the antithesis of everything Eric held dear. Her work was about logic, diagnosis, and order, and her every movement was precise, efficient. She wasn't one for artistic flair; she saw the world in symptoms and treatments. When she examined his hand, her touch was cool and professional, her questions direct. ""Have you had a tetanus shot in the last five years?"" she asked, her voice calm and even.
Eric, always the dramatist, had a dozen witty lines prepared, about how his art was his defense against the world, how a paper cut was a metaphor for the small, insidious ways life wounded you. But Aurora just looked at him, waiting for a simple answer. He found himself, for once, disarmed. ""I don't know,"" he mumbled, feeling like a high schooler caught with a forged note.
A week later, his hand was healing, but the image of Aurora persisted. He found her clinical focus oddly captivating. Her dedication was a kind of performance art he'd never considered: the quiet drama of healing, the life-and-death stakes played out not on a stage but in a sterile examination room. He began finding excuses to see her, each more transparent than the last. An imaginary sore throat, a phantom headache. Each time, Aurora's skepticism grew.
""Mr. Thorne,"" she said during his third visit, her eyes narrowed, ""your symptoms are… theatrical.""
He grinned, the mask of the charming playwright falling perfectly into place. ""Is there a treatment for that, doctor?""
Aurora didn't smile. ""There is. It's called honesty.""
Caught, Eric dropped the act. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, the words feeling foreign and heavy in his mouth. ""It's just… I wanted to see you.""
The admission hung in the air between them, thick with the unscripted tension that Eric normally reserved for his plays. Aurora, for her part, looked at him with an inscrutable expression, a doctor assessing a new and baffling case. She wasn't used to this kind of vulnerability, this directness that had no corresponding medical code.
She didn't dismiss him. She didn't call security. Instead, she did something Eric wouldn't have dared to write: she invited him for coffee.
Their first date was a jarring juxtaposition of their worlds. At a small café, Eric spoke in sweeping, dramatic metaphors about the human condition, while Aurora, over her meticulously prepared tea, listened with a calm, analytical patience, asking questions that deconstructed his elaborate artistic claims. He spoke about the power of an unfinished gesture, and she described the necessity of closing a wound to prevent infection. He saw poetry; she saw biology.
But as the weeks passed, a quiet rhythm developed between them. Eric began to see the poetry in her science. The precise symmetry of a bone, the rhythmic thrum of a healthy heart, the meticulous ballet of a surgeon's hands. Aurora, in turn, began to understand the chaos he deliberately created. She saw that his plays, in their raw vulnerability, were not about the absence of logic but about the overwhelming force of emotion that logic couldn't always contain.
She brought him to the hospital on a tour, showing him the sterile, humming floors, and the quiet dignity of people facing their own mortality. He, in turn, brought her to the theater, where she watched his actors, raw and unpolished, bare their souls on stage. He saw her lean forward, her professional distance forgotten, her face showing a flicker of the compassion she usually kept locked away.
One evening, after a particularly draining dress rehearsal, Eric and Aurora were sitting on a park bench. ""You know,"" she said, breaking a comfortable silence, ""when you came into my office, I thought you were another lost soul seeking a diagnosis for his artistic angst.""
Eric chuckled. ""And what do you think now?""
Aurora took his hand, her fingers tracing the faint white line of his healed paper cut. ""I think… I think you're a good story, Eric. And I'm just beginning to understand the plot.""
And for Eric, the playwright who had always controlled every line and every action, it was the most perfect, unscripted moment of his life.

**DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC AT CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA?**

  
  


*AS EVERY GOOD STORY WORTH TELLING DOES*, this one begins with a string of curse words, a dream and the passing of time. A little mystery, the cliche coming of age agony and the dizzying California sun is part of it too. But the most important thing is this- do you believe in magic? If you’re like most then be prepared to be open to it, because this is a story worth telling. Have a little patience, and try to be open minded. It’ll get you pretty far as a reader. Before that, though, there’s someplace I’d like you to hear about. 



Carmel-by-the-sea, California, is home to one of the quaintest beach cities you’d ever see. In nearly every single aspect, it’s picture perfect. Obviously, there's the beaches- Carmel beach is in and of itself beautiful, but there’s an odd charm in the way the sea mist rolls in over the sand every morning and floats on up the cliffs, past the shoreline and into the neighbourhoods. It glitters in the sun, dust bunnies and bugs catching the light when the sun hits it just so. These Monterey-Cypress trees are dark and beautiful with their bark, home to the birdsong that trebles from it daily at dawn. Carmel is quiet in the mornings, but the noise of life still finds a way to carry in the sea breeze. Like, the rhythmic thudding and laboured breathing of the runners that whip through the Scenic Pathway that overlooks the beach. There’s the hum of the electricity that pumps through the cafes early mornings too, waiting for the exercise junkies and early risers to grab their fan favourite anorexic deal smoothies (Only 99 calories and $3.99 a piece!) and the odd car crunching the sand and stone paths it rolls over. Amber sunlight filters through expensive linen curtains and tree dappled light melts and blends onto the roofs of the quaint little beach houses nestled close like babies. There’s washing lines still up from the day before, because the weather never gets bad in Carmel and well, wouldn’t you know it, there’s nothing better than fresh clothes dried in sea breeze. On humid mornings the dew from the sheer fog that rolls in collects in droplets on the grass of manicured lawns, maybe onto the bleached cliffs overlooking Carmel beach. Nearly every sandy winding path through Carmel-by-the-sea is fragrant with salty air  and cut grass and the smell of something mineral and magic. If you were one to care about these types of things, you’d be pleased and a little jealous to know that Carmel-by-the-sea boasts a small but humble population of around 3,000 - give or take. And if you were to rip out a page from one of those homey, lifestyle magazines, you’d see the citizens of Carmel smiling lazily right back at you. 



This is where the elderly and frail settle down to live out their last long stretch of days, baking in the sun and drinking fruit teas. This is where the pompous and pretentious come to snag up heftily priced cottages and properties with thatched roofs, cosplaying the lives of some slice of life romance novel characters. This is where the rich folks come to leave behind the dirty noise and pollution of L.A and drive up the price of coffee and pastries. This is where the lives of young people play out lazily beneath the sun, with all the time in the world for beer coolers at the beach and a promise to move onto bigger and better places once they’re fresh, wise and twenty something. This is where the wind whips up sand into your eyes and air into your lungs, where the concept of doing life is somewhat bearable when a pretty view and an abundance of Vitamin D joins the equation. This is where young men surf the waves like something from a painting and where their female counterparts watch from the sand, windswept and vibrating with the thrill of it all. This is where the kids at school compete with one another, where the anorexic runners complain about the way the sea mist frizzes their blowout, where the cafe owners pour creamy coffee into ceramic cups and carry them outside to set down onto mediterranean tables filled with laughter and gossip. You can catch a tan in Carmel, sure, or stop on by Point Lobos with your wetsuit still soaked. You can do almost anything here, but you just can’t get the locals to grasp the real magic that pulses through Carmel-by-the-sea. 



And sure, those that have lived here and know not to take it for granted will tell you in a heartbeat that Carmel has a certain magic charm that’s hard to replicate anywhere else along the west coast. They just don't get it though- in the way they define magic, I suppose they're right. But there's real, solid and godless magic in Carmel, not something driven by crystals and brooms. It is as ancient as the trees and rocks and cliffs here, and it breathes with the sea and rolls in with the fog each morning until it settles thick and heavy and invisible in the air and lungs of the people here. It is soaked into the foundations and floors that people stand on and live their lives on here, it curls through branches and sings with the birds and floods the stores with a buzz most don’t hear. Dark magic and warm fluttery magic co-exist in Carmel, and they flit interchangeably through open windows at night like fireflies. This magic is thicker than the air and denser than the fog and completely scentless. But at night, when the moon hangs huge, those in tune will feel some part of it. The particles scattered in millions low to the floor, the sense of something watchful hidden under the moon’s gaze being somehow everywhere all at once. Most don’t. Few  in tune will, however, and they will not dwell on it. What is incomprehensible to the human mind will often stay that way out of kind ignorance and fear. But there is no argument, however skeptical you may be. If magic exists anywhere in the world, it resides in Carmel-by-the-sea.

I was so stricken with grief and disappointment that I almost collapsed on the concrete, literally shaking uncontrollably.

While I believe that it is healthy for children of all ages to explore their spirituality freely across the spectrum, I cannot believe that it is now LITERAL NAZIS doing the grooming. This FASCIST REGIME has me literally shaking on the 24/hr coffee shop bathroom floor that I will be taking a nap on for the night, before I am allowed to visit my wife's boyfriend's house again to bring them some medicine and receive some comforting pets as consolation for this travesty.

What has our city come to that we now have to worry about the grooming of our children under LITERAL NAZI FASCISTS? I can't even right now. LITERALLY SHAKING.",16,1759014485.0,austincirclejerk,13,0.77,False

I've been obsessing over coffee grinders lately, and I thought I'd share what I've learned about modern models. After spending countless hours researching and testing different grinders, I can tell you that today's machines are nothing like the basic blade grinders our parents used.

First off, let's talk about what really matters in a modern coffee grinder. The biggest game-changer has been the shift to burr grinding systems. I recently picked up a fantastic burr grinder (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), and the difference in my morning brew is mind-blowing.

Modern grinders now come with precision settings that would've seemed like science fiction a decade ago. We're talking 40+ grind settings, from super fine espresso to coarse French press grounds. What I love most is how consistent the particle size is - no more half-ground beans ruining your brew!

Digital displays are becoming standard now, which is pretty cool. You can actually see your grind time and size settings instead of just guessing. Some models even remember your preferred settings for different brewing methods.

Here's something that really impressed me: anti-static technology. Remember those messy grounds flying everywhere? That's becoming a thing of the past. The newer models I've tested (including this one: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) have features that reduce static cling significantly.

The noise level has improved too. Modern grinders use better motors and sound-dampening materials. My neighbor doesn't hate me anymore when I grind beans at 6 AM!

Another huge improvement is the hopper design. Many new models have UV-protected hoppers that keep beans fresher longer, and some even have airtight seals. Plus, they're usually removable, making cleaning way easier.

Speaking of cleaning, most new grinders come with automatic cleaning notifications and removable parts. Some even have built-in cleaning brushes - such a simple addition but so helpful.

What really sells me on modern grinders is their durability. Companies are using better materials like stainless steel burrs and tougher plastics. Mine's been running strong for over a year now with zero issues.

Timer functions are getting smarter too. You can grind exactly the amount you need for one cup or a whole pot. No more wasting beans or grinding too little - it's pretty much foolproof.

I've noticed that even entry-level models now come with features that used to be high-end only. Things like dose control, multiple user profiles, and even smartphone connectivity in some cases.

If you're still using an old grinder or (gasp!) pre-ground coffee, I really think it's worth upgrading. The difference in taste is incredible, and these modern features make the whole process so much more enjoyable.

Let me know if you have any questions about specific features or models - I've probably tried them all at this point!",1,1759014480.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I woke up and felt fine. I took a walk to the store, got a coffee and a snack. Felt good.

But after a while, the memories of her popped up and I remembered the pain and the hurt. Maybe 30 minutes ago, I almost downloaded the app where we used to talk. I’m proud of myself I didn’t but I want to so badly

I must not do this. I have to move on. I have to be my own person. Love myself. But the pain… the hurt… the tiredness…

It’s only been a day since I decided to go no contact. I know it takes time. I know I’ve learnt a lesson. Doesn’t take away any of what I feel ",3,1759014153.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
