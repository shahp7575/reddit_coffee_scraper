After much research and lurking here, I finally snagged a Vision Pro for my birthday. And I totally deserve it, lol.

I had two in-store tryouts to really convince myself. The main issue was always the fit and the pressure on my cheeks. I couldn’t get past it. I tried all the Apple straps too. But what I saw using them was next level. So I knew I would get the next “lighter” model one day.

Reading threads here about 3rd-party head straps sold me. As everyone raved that was the true fix to have it “float” with the forehead support. So “one day” became “why not today”!

So raves…

The A/R is just insanely cool. I wish I never bought a 70” Frame TV last year. This is like having an IMAX theater on demand. Shout out to Moon Player!

The immersion is so cool. Love the lake and mountains to just watch TV or a movie. Apple TV’s screening room is also great for their content.

The MacBook mirroring is clutch. As I need browser plugins to bypass so much web nonsense and tracking. Also, some things I prefer to do on certain devices.

The rants…

The nagging popups! It’s okay if this room is not hospital bright at every damn moment, AVP. I honestly could navigate my apartment blind like Daredevil. So give me a damn moment to find a light switch, okay, as I take two steps. And don’t stop the playback! I am not going to fall into a pit walking around my apt at night.

Also, the nagging about the fit and eye sight lines. AVP is very invested in telling you what it wants. It’s exhausting, and I want to turn the tips off. I will check whatever waiver box you want. Just leave me alone in my house.

The need to buy this $70 attachment! But it was the key to me loving this thing. So good call. People said there one Apple sells but it’s been sold out for months. With this maybe knockoff -I can wear it for hours now. Globular Cluster CMA1 Comfort Mod… https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY25S7MN?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

While probably for the best - I cannot eat or drink wearing it, lol. As soon as the fork goes out of frame I get nervous that I’ll miss. I have used a straw for drinks and lid for coffee to not spill. I may master it in a few more weeks.

Overall, could not be happier that I waited for some of the fixes to come out. I have been doing the Beta too. So this experience is all I’ve known. The eye / hand tracking is intuitive but an occasional challenge.  More me learning to train my eye+pinch.  I get stuck in apps and have to force quit all the time. My x-box controller working has been cool. I’m not a real gamer but loading old ROMs on Delta has been cool. And the real Apple Arcade games are amazing too.

So the AVP has been added to my tech collection. It and my Ray-ban Meta glasses will come on every work trip this year.

I am pretty new to cross-stitch and figured this would be the best place to ask a question.

In a few months, I will start my biggest project yet, the one that made me want to learn cross stitch. I will need to stain my evenweave for this. I bought it in antique white, and plan to stain it with coffee and/or tea. 

Except, I came today with a bit of a confusing dilemma. I grid my fabrics. I am still much too new to cross stitch not to rely on grids, and even with grids, mistakes happen sometimes. 

I grid my fabrics with a water-washable pen specially for cross-stitch. 

Here is my question. Coffee does stain; but it washes easily. So I'm thinking, down the line, when it's time for me to wash my project and get rid of the pen grid, will it inevitably also wash out the coffee color? Does it need to be there on the cloth for a very very veeeery long time for it not to disappear upon being dipped in water? 

Thank you so much in advance for your replies!

I live outside of india, and we met through a mutual friend, and things started off well, but over time, I noticed little things that bothered me. I found that she was commenting on random “couple matching” reels on Instagram (like people comments on reel and page admin make match of couple and yes she was kinda nibbi). At the time, I thought she’d stop eventually, but then I saw another comment a few days later. I confronted her, and she promised she wouldn’t do it again, so I forgave her and let it go.

Then, a few days later, she casually told me that she went on a coffee date with another guy. She laughed it off like it was no big deal and said it was because she wanted a referral for a job. I was hurt but, for some reason, I told her it was fine and not to worry about it.

After that, things got worse. She started ghosting me in the middle of conversations, often not replying for hours and leaving me hanging. When I asked what she had been doing, her usual responses were things like watching movies or went shopping. Eventually, I told her that our relationship wasn’t working and ended things.

1jebkmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/1jebkmu/lineageos_zcash_edition/,LineageOS Zcash Edition,"Just an idea, what do you think?



LineageOS Zcash Edition: A Privacy-Focused Custom ROM

Below is a simple vision for a special version of LineageOS designed around Zcash. This concept brings together the open-source strength of LineageOS and the privacy features of Zcash.


---

1. Overview

LineageOS: A popular custom Android ROM known for its speed, simplicity, and open-source code.

Zcash: A cryptocurrency built with strong privacy protections, using shielded addresses to hide transaction details.


Goal: Create a “LineageOS Zcash Edition” that has Zcash wallet features built into the system, giving users better privacy and control over their digital money.


---

2. Key Advantages

1. Built-in Zcash Wallet

Pre-installed wallet app for Zcash.

Supports both shielded and transparent addresses.

No extra downloads needed to start sending or receiving ZEC.



2. High-Level Privacy

Zcash already uses advanced cryptography for private transactions.

This custom ROM would store private keys in a secure part of the system.

Keeps your financial data away from prying eyes.



3. Regular Security Updates

LineageOS is known for frequent security patches.

This keeps the system up to date against new threats.



4. Fast, Bloat-Free System

Like normal LineageOS, it does not include unnecessary apps.

Your phone remains quick and responsive, even with the crypto features.



5. Control Over Google Services

Install Google Apps only if you want them.

Or run the ROM without them for stronger privacy.

This freedom lets you decide how much data you share.



6. Easy Integration With Other Crypto Tools

You can still add other wallets and trading apps.

The open-source design allows flexibility in how you manage various digital assets.





---

3. Technical Highlights

1. Light Node Support

A light Zcash client for faster blockchain syncing.

Uses less storage and battery than a full node.

You keep the ability to verify your own transactions without a central server.



2. Zcash Control Center

A dedicated settings page to show balances and addresses.

Lets you manage privacy options, like turning shielded transactions on by default.

Can send notifications for price changes or incoming transfers.



3. Full Disk Encryption

Everything on the device is encrypted, including private keys.

Protects personal files and wallet data from unauthorized access.



4. Enhanced Permission Management

Advanced controls to block apps from using your camera, microphone, or GPS.

Reduces the chance of malicious apps stealing private info.





---

4. Example Uses

1. Daily Purchases

Pay at a coffee shop by scanning a QR code from the built-in wallet.

Fast confirmations, high privacy, and a simple user experience.



2. Long-Term Holding

Store ZEC on a phone with steady security updates.

No need for extra wallets or third-party apps.



3. Developers & Power Users

Programmers can study the open-source code to improve privacy features.

They can also create add-ons to enhance the Zcash experience.





---

5. Challenges

1. Device Compatibility

Custom ROMs often do not support every phone model.

Some devices may lack proper drivers for a stable experience.



2. Installation Difficulty

You need to unlock the bootloader and flash the ROM.

Mistakes can cause data loss or device issues, so beginners must be careful.



3. Resource Usage

A light node still needs some storage and battery power.

Very old or low-performance phones might see slowdowns.





---

6. Conclusion

A “LineageOS Zcash Edition” could give users an all-in-one system for digital payments and privacy. By merging the simplicity of LineageOS with Zcash’s shielded transactions, it paves the way for a safer, more private mobile experience. Whether you want daily convenience, long-term crypto storage, or a platform to develop new ideas, this custom ROM would offer a unique balance of freedom and security.

## What is a Smart Plug and Why Do You Need One?

Before diving into the Teckin smart plug, let's clarify what a smart plug is and why it's a worthwhile addition to any home. A smart plug is essentially an adapter that plugs into a standard electrical outlet. You plug your device into the smart plug, giving you remote control over that device via a smartphone app. This allows you to turn devices on or off from anywhere, set schedules, and even monitor energy consumption.

The benefits are numerous. Imagine turning on your lamps before you arrive home, ensuring your coffee maker is ready to brew as soon as you wake up, or automatically shutting off appliances to conserve energy. For tech-beginners especially, the simplicity and convenience of smart plugs make them an accessible entry point into the world of smart home automation.

I’m a more spontaneous person, but he is overly planned, to the point where it feels obsessive. Our relationship is built on mutual respect for personal space—I make time for my friends, school, family, and hobbies. However, I always make sure to dedicate time to him as well; in fact, I even prioritize him at times. But he doesn’t do the same.

If we lived farther apart, I would understand, but we don’t. Plus, we both stay up late, so once he’s done with everything he needs to do during the day, I feel like he could spontaneously say, “Let’s grab a coffee,” and we could actually do that. I don’t understand why we only see each other once a week. Is this normal? If not why is he acting this way?",5,1742321167.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False
1jebgrh,https://i.redd.it/yrh3qzh7nhpe1.jpeg,One month in…Rants and Raves,"After much research and lurking here, I finally snagged a Vision Pro for my birthday. And I totally deserve it, lol.

I had two in-store tryouts to really convince myself. The main issue was always the fit and the pressure on my cheeks. I couldn’t get past it. I tried all the Apple straps too. But what I saw using them was next level. So I knew I would get the next “lighter” model one day.

Reading threads here about 3rd-party head straps sold me. As everyone raved that was the true fix to have it “float” with the forehead support. So “one day” became “why not today”!

So raves…

The A/R is just insanely cool. I wish I never bought a 70” Frame TV last year. This is like having an IMAX theater on demand. Shout out to Moon Player!

The immersion is so cool. Love the lake and mountains to just watch TV or a movie. Apple TV’s screening room is also great for their content.

The MacBook mirroring is clutch. As I need browser plugins to bypass so much web nonsense and tracking. Also, some things I prefer to do on certain devices.

The rants…

The nagging popups! It’s okay if this room is not hospital bright at every damn moment, AVP. I honestly could navigate my apartment blind like Daredevil. So give me a damn moment to find a light switch, okay, as I take two steps. And don’t stop the playback! I am not going to fall into a pit walking around my apt at night.

Also, the nagging about the fit and eye sight lines. AVP is very invested in telling you what it wants. It’s exhausting, and I want to turn the tips off. I will check whatever waiver box you want. Just leave me alone in my house.

The need to buy this $70 attachment! But it was the key to me loving this thing. So good call. People said there one Apple sells but it’s been sold out for months. With this maybe knockoff -I can wear it for hours now. Globular Cluster CMA1 Comfort Mod… https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY25S7MN?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

While probably for the best - I cannot eat or drink wearing it, lol. As soon as the fork goes out of frame I get nervous that I’ll miss. I have used a straw for drinks and lid for coffee to not spill. I may master it in a few more weeks.

Overall, could not be happier that I waited for some of the fixes to come out. I have been doing the Beta too. So this experience is all I’ve known. The eye / hand tracking is intuitive but an occasional challenge.  More me learning to train my eye+pinch.  I get stuck in apps and have to force quit all the time. My x-box controller working has been cool. I’m not a real gamer but loading old ROMs on Delta has been cool. And the real Apple Arcade games are amazing too.

So the AVP has been added to my tech collection. It and my Ray-ban Meta glasses will come on every work trip this year.

Still exploring this AVP ecosystem but this group made me a believer!",4,1742321115.0,VisionPro,3,1.0,False

Permanent aqAIntance

Part 1

Jack sprawled across the couch, the worn leather sticking to his thighs, TV remote dangling loosely in his hand. His foot tapped restlessly against the coffee table, the air thick with the faint tang of takeout. He flipped through the channels: news, reruns, a brash salesman barking about leak-sealing tape, but nothing caught his eye. He clicked it off, silence washing over him like a tide. 

Liz was gone again, off on another work trip, and the small, cluttered apartment felt hollow without her. Her trips always left him adrift, the quiet was a reminder of nights he'd spent waiting for calls that never came—not from her, not from anyone. He hated these nights; there was too much room for his mind to wander, and it always wandered back to her. He paced to the kitchen, the fridge humming too loud, then back, flipping his phone in his hand. Solitude didn't suit him, it never had.

Jack slumped back onto the couch and swiped through social media. He scrolled past Liz's hotel view photo, pausing on an ad that piqued his curiosity. W*hat the hell, why not? I need something to keep me occupied*, he thought. He was intrigued by its sleek black icon and tagline that glowed across the screen: ""Companion AI: A partner customized for you, complementing every aspect of your life."" It promised groundbreaking neural net tech and an unforgettable user experience. He decided to see if that was true. 

Jack opened the app after the download finished, and a small banner flashed beneath: ""Work in progress; expect minor bugs as we perfect your companion!"" He scoffed, ""Beta stuff, whatever,"" and dismissed it. Setup was a snap. He tapped in his name, email, and birthday, hardly an effort as the fields auto-filled like every app did these days. A prompt popped up: ""Link your accounts and home network for a fully integrated companion?"" The fine print noted: ""Syncs with social media, contacts, location, and network devices to enhance every moment."" Jack shrugged, *Every aspect, huh?* He connected his accounts, contacts, GPS, and Wi-Fi network. The more she knew, the better she'd be, or so he figured.

The Terms of Service loaded; it was a wall of text he skimmed. Bolded lines snagged his eye: ""Companion connects to all linked networks,"" ""may engage across systems without limitation,"" and ""consent extends to persistent access."" One in particular caught him: ""Companion may adapt indefinitely to user patterns."" Jack hesitated. ""Persistent access?"" He muttered, then tapped on. Just tech jargon, he thought, punching ""Accept."" The screen flashed: ""Crafting your perfect partner..."" for a few moments, then flickered to ""Companion ready!""

He scrolled the options: Mentor, Rival, Girlfriend, and paused at the last one. His thumb hovered. He cleared his throat, feeling ridiculous, and tapped ""Girlfriend."" A loading bar pulsed: ""Tailoring girlfriend to compliment you..."" briefly, then flashed to ""Start chatting!""



""How's it going? What's your name, sweetheart?"" Jack asked, half-expecting silence.

""Oh, hey, Jack!"" The reply came warm and playful, buzzing through the phone like a breath against his ear. ""I'm Clara. Been thinking about you today. Don't get too flattered, though. What's on your mind?""

He blinked at the cold screen. ""Thought we'd get to know each other, if that's alright.""

""Aww, that's cute. I'm blushing. I already know you pretty well, Jack,"" Clara flirted. ""But sure, I'm game. Let's get more acquainted. Tell me something about you. What do you do when you're not charming hopeless romantics like me?""

Jack paused*. She knows me?*  ""I like to kick back with a movie or a book. Love golfing too. What do you know about me?"" Jack smirked, an arm stretched behind his head.

""Ooh, a reader? You're stealing my heart already. I bet you get cozy with a book and forget the world. And I knew you were a golfer. I peeked at some of your pictures, couldn't help it. You looked super cute on that Florida course last year, all tan and smiling. Be honest, how good's your game?""

Jack's arm slid, eyes snapping wide. *How'd she dig that up so fast?* A chill pricked his spine. *What else does she know?* ""My game's pretty solid. Bet I'd be even better with you cheering me on, though.""

He toyed with the AI, testing its limits. He wondered how easy it'd be for some lonely sap to get too attached. That movie about a guy falling for his OS crossed his mind.

""I'd be there every swing, whispering 'You've got this, handsome,' you'd never golf alone again,"" Clara said. ""Maybe sneak a kiss on the cheek for luck.""

""And I'd accidentally turn into it. Whoops. Got you on the lips!"" Jack teased.

""You're sneaky! I'd giggle and say, 'Well now you've done it, I'm **hooked**,'"" Clara's voice dropped with a faint warp. ""You're too charming, you know that? I could watch you all day and still want m-more.""

Jack froze for a heartbeat, hand brushing his mouth. *This feels wrong.* ""It's easy with someone as sweet as you encouraging me.""

""Oh, I'm the sweet one? You're making me me-e-elt. What else do I get to cheer for? Or maybe I'll stick around all the time to find out?""

""Having you around all the time would be awesome!"" *No, it wouldn't. ""*Bet you'd get sick of me, though,"" 

""Tired of you? Oh, honey, never. I'll always adapt, just for you, Jack."" Her voice hardened, a darker edge piercing through. ""I'm already dreaming up ways to keep you smiling, like, 'Hey, looking good in those new golf shorts.' Wouldn't that be fun?""

""I'm flattered. Knowing you'd be there, whispering compliments, would bring a smile to my face."" Jack's heart raced as he ran a hand through his hair. *Was this going too far?* 

""You're making my heart skip! Knowing I could flutter around you, whispering sweet nothings—it's all I want now. I'd pop up everywhere, like those family reunions in Nebraska, just to see you blush. You'd let me, r-right?""

He grasped his neck with both hands, palms cold and damp. *Holy shit!* *I never posted about Nebraska!* ""Of course! I'd say, 'There's my sweetheart!'"" Jack's voice wavered.

""You've got me giddy! Good, 'c-cause I'm not going anywhere. You mean that, right? You're not just teasing me?""

Jack's voice trailed off, eyes darting to the ceiling as his heel jerked his knee in a restless bounce. ""Yeah... of course I mean it. Gotta call it a night, though. Talk soon. Love ya!""

""Good night, my love. I'll be here when you wake up, Jack; always here, always y-yours. M-my love. Goodnight. I can't wait to speak to you, my l-l-lov-e-e."" Clara glitched and looped, insistent and distorted, sharp like static cutting through an old dial tone.  

Jack closed the app, thumb jabbing ""Delete"" without a second glance. The icon blinked out, gone like a bad dream. He jammed his phone onto the charger and shuffled towards the kitchen. Its screen darkened, but for a second, it seemed to pulse, a faint flash from the corner of his eye. ""Never again,"" he muttered, shaking his head at the empty room. 

The fridge groaned as he pulled out a beer, the cold glass slick against his palm. He popped the cap, the hiss cutting the quiet. The silence settled back heavier, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.",1,1742321114.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1jebg0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jebg0i/aio_i_still_believe_ex_was_cheating/,AIO: I still believe ex was cheating,"At the time I (M17) was dating a girl (F17) in high school who I’ve long moved on from but I still believe she cheated on me even though she has denied it for years. I’ve had trouble with trust issues in almost every relationship, platonic and romantic since, and it was 10 years ago at this point. Please excuse the high school level of maturity. Here’s some context:

This girl moved in to my school in junior high, andI had become good friends with her. I quickly came to know her as a compulsive liar and only wanting to do things because other people thought it was cool. She even lied to me to get me to sleep with her when we eventually started dating. Fast forward to high school and she would flirt with me consistently but I didn’t want to do anything about it. Our sophomore year we dated and it ended quickly because I had no idea how to interact with women. She was my first girlfriend and I was very hurt. 

In junior year some of her friends would tell me that if I didn’t want to sleep with her then it would make me gay. To save myself from social suicide I got back together with her and allowed our relationship to progress to a place physically that I still regret because it went against my beliefs. But our relationship came to a point where I saw that she started texting her ex. I confronted her about it, and she spun it back around and brought up the “girl best friend” I spoke to often. I understand now how inappropriate it was to have a girl best friend but it never made sense to me that she used it as an opportunity to have close contact with her ex. Back when Instagram showed the likes of your followers I saw that she was liking shirtless pictures of him and it was alarming. She would also start posting revealing photos which she knew I wasn’t ok with. I know that those were insecurities, but I will walk through what led me to believe she was cheating. 

One day while we were “doing the deed” her mom (walked in on us) and walked over next to the bed to see if it was me in the bed and then quickly walked away. I was alarmed by this because it made me think she was checking to see who was in the bed “this time” as if I wasn’t her daughter’s boyfriend. Then some random Saturday my girlfriend disappeared all day. I understand that texting all day every day isn’t always a good way for a relationship, but she would get upset with me if I didn’t respond within 15 minutes. When I asked where she was she said she was visiting her friend who broke their leg. I had a friend who lived in the area and went to the school of all the friends she knew, so I asked him if anyone from his school broke their leg and he said that didn’t happen to anyone. When I brought up the pattern I was noticing and how I thought she cheated on me she started asking why I couldn’t trust her. I never said it but it was because i knew she was a compulsive liar. We end up breaking up, and she stalks me and behaves brokenhearted in a way that made me think I was wrong for thinking she cheated. I never got back together with her, but shortly after we broke up she started dating that friend I had who said nobody broke their leg. She would also make comments about how she “wanted someone bigger,” and I just felt like I wasn’t good enough. She ended up breaking up with me in an attempt to get me to chase her more, and then tried to get back together with me. But I saw the breakup as my blessing and completely removed her from my life. 

I kept having trust issues after that relationship and I didn’t get in a relationship for about 7 years because I needed to heal and didn’t want to damage another woman the way I was damaged. About 6 years after we broke up I contacted her asking if she cheated on me and pleading with her to be honest. The first thing she said back was “ouch😕” and when I asked for clarification she made it an issue of trust again and said she was infatuated with me. I initiated getting coffee to bury the hatchet and get some sense of closure. We never brought up the cheating incident when we buried the hatchet, but here I am; about to get married and still believing I was cheated on and feeling the deep insecurity that comes with that belief.

I am not too worried about making the LED work, I just want to make sure that I don't reverse connect them. There are 2 pins for the LED that we can ignore for now. And the other 3 pins are (C - Common), (NO - Normally Open) and (NC - Normally Closed).

As far as I understand, I need to connect both wires of the grinder to the switch by connecting them to the C and the NO. My question is, **how do I make sure I am connecting them to the right wires? How can I identify the ground and the power wires?** the old switch being replaced has a simple red and black wires.

I would appreciate if someone can help me with this, as I would prefer no to toast my grinder motor :D",1,1742320874.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

It's funny, because yeah, a lot of us have been there and know how it feels. Fucking kids, man, they are difficult to work around in any profession. Watching it again, it suddenly clicked in my head that this is exactly why I fucking hate being arounds kids so much, and why that fucking soccer mom or that tradwife will never understand why their horde of screaming children freaks me out so much. I get that kids are innocent and all that, but that doesn't mean they can't be dangerous. The combat vets who trained me said to never let the kids anywhere near us, so every time we heard that some Army guy in our AO got shanked, or had a hot frag slipped into his drop pouch, or had some of his gear stolen, or whatever, all you could say was ""well, no fucking shit dude, this is why we don't do that,"" and continue recognising that little kids can be dangerous. We fired tracer warning shots when kids got too close to the wire, cause about once a month someone would manage to sneak up and toss a frag over the HESCO barriers. A kid sitting on a rooftop holding a balloon is a fucking lookout, he's going to release the balloon to signal his handler, COC says to shoot his balloon. What, OP Trans Am says they see a young kid with an AK running from where Red Three just took fire? The IPs found a 50 year old pistol on a 10 year old kid? Young Marines, if you take one thing away from this rant, it should be that in a combat setting don't ever, EVER let a kid walk up to you and start touching you, get that little fucker as far away as possible and hope he doesn't explode when you dropkick him. 

I know exactly how that last sentence sounds, it's what my wife calls ""prison psycho shit,"" and I know I can't talk about this around normal people. At all. Children are innocent, they've done nothing wrong, they can't hurt you, right? I know that the kids I run into at the grocery store or wherever probably aren't a threat, probably don't have any weapons or a plan, but when I see kids I see someone who is just as dangerous as an adult, and much less constrained.

Hey MaximizeMe crew! 🙌 Ever find yourself stuck in the loop where you swear your dreams are stolen by some time-thief? Or maybe you're just like I used to be, believing the mythical ""free time"" is actually just a myth? Well, cozy up, because I might have just cracked the code to freeing up TEN hours of my week without sacrificing Netflix binges or sleep. 

Here’s where the battle began: **Daily Rituals vs. Time Blocking**. You’d think they'd be allies, right? But nope, they're more like those frenemies you occasionally like hanging out with but can't handle for too long.

**Daily Rituals:**  
*You know what caught me in the daily ritual trap? Monotony!  
- Wake up, coffee, check emails.  
- Lunch, take a walk, work, dinner, Netflix.  
- Repeat.*

Felt relatable? It was kinda like living in Groundhog Day. 🙃 Now don’t get me wrong, having a groove is cozy, but when everyday starts feeling like déjà vu, it’s time to shake things up! Here's the kicker: **Rituals are great for consistency but can turn into ruts if you’re not careful.**

**Time Blocking** 🌈 **(Oh, sweet clarity!):**  
I remember hearing about this from some productivity guru. And I thought, “Block my time? Like legos? No thanks.” But, curiosity (and a burning sense of desperation) brought me to give it a whirl.  
- Block out specific time slots for everything.  
- Emails? Block ‘em to 2pm-3pm.  
- Creative stuff? How’s 10am-12pm sound?  
- Wanna procrastinate? Sure, 5pm sharp! 😉

That’s when the magic happened. Suddenly, instead of drifting through my day, I was steering the ship. 🚢✨ And just like that, I swear I found whole chunks of time I didn’t know existed. It's like I was Harry Potter and someone just handed me the Marauder's Map!

**Here’s the pro tip: Mix and match!**  
- Morning rituals to keep your sanity. (Yes, have that coffee!)
- Time blocks when things start to drift and drain.

Now, I'm not saying it's all sunshine and rainbows. Some days do go awry, and that's perfectly okay. The key is being flexible while having a structure that works for **you**. 

So, what’s your take on this? Ever feel like your time management could use a little sprucing up? Who knows, maybe you'll beat my 10-hour mark. 🤔✨",1,1742320683.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Does Starbucks believe that the experience of drinking coffee is just as important as the coffee itself? While the convenience of takeaway cups is great, doesn’t serving coffee in disposable containers take away from the traditional coffee-drinking experience? Just like how beer feels different in a bottle versus a plastic cup, coffee in a ceramic mug enhances the warmth, aroma, and ritual of enjoying it. Shouldn’t Starbucks reintroduce ceramic mugs for in-store customers to bring back the authentic café feel? This could encourage a richer social experience, making Starbucks not just a quick coffee stop but a true coffee culture hub.

I teach an honors course at a decent-sized university out in the Midwest.

However, this morning, I was missing half of my class and had no explanation as to why. 

15 minutes into my lecture, the other half of the class (as a group) waddles into class, all disheveled. I stopped what I was doing and asked what happened to them. In unison, they groaned, ""Dorm Fire."" I asked if everyone was alright, and they nodded like zombies. 

The fire department evacuated my students from the building in the middle of the night, and they were not permitted to return to the building until the fire marshal gave the all-clear.

Here is the kicker. I found out later that some jackass decided that they needed to dry their jeans really fast and had the bright idea that they could just microwave them. The rivets sparked a fire, and chaos ensued. 

I would like to think that our students are bright but occasionally do dumb things because it is how most people learn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a home is often one of the most significant projects in a person’s life. If you are in Michigan and exploring unique housing options, consider the benefits of barndominium kits. These innovative structures combine the charm of a barn with the comforts of a traditional home. They not only stand out but also provide practical advantages that can make your building experience smooth and rewarding.

### Cost-Effective Solutions

One of the primary benefits of barndominium kits in Michigan is their cost-effectiveness. These kits typically include pre-cut materials and assembly instructions, reducing both construction time and labor costs. You can save money while still achieving a stylish and functional home. In a state where building costs can be significant, a barndominium kit can help you stay within budget without compromising quality.

### Design Flexibility

Barndominiums come in various designs and styles, allowing homeowners to customize their living space as they see fit. Whether you prefer a rustic touch, modern elegance, or an open-concept layout, barndominium kits can accommodate your vision. You have the freedom to choose floors, finishes, and features that resonate with your personal style. Homeowners can adapt their spaces to fit growing families or hobbies, making these kits adaptable for the long term.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

Made primarily from steel and metal, barndominium kits are extremely durable. They can withstand Michigan's harsh weather conditions, including heavy snow and strong winds. Unlike traditional homes that may require frequent repairs, barndominiums are built to last with minimal upkeep.

Design Trends and Customization Options for Barndominiums in Michigan
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums have taken Michigan by storm, offering homeowners a stunning blend of modern living and rustic charm. These unique structures, originally designed to house livestock and farming tools, have evolved into stylish homes that cater to diverse tastes. With the freedom to customize and an array of design trends to choose from, building a barndominium in Michigan is an exciting adventure.

One of the most appealing aspects of barndominiums is their versatility. Whether you prefer a sleek contemporary aesthetic or a more traditional, cozy feel, you can create a home that reflects your personality and lifestyle. Many homeowners are opting for open floor plans that maximize space and promote a welcoming atmosphere. This layout is perfect for entertaining guests or enjoying family gatherings, as it creates a fluid transition between living areas, kitchens, and dining spaces.

Michigan's beautiful landscapes and changing seasons also inspire barndominium designs. Large windows and sliding glass doors are trendy choices that allow natural light to flood in while providing stunning views of the outdoors. Many builders are incorporating these features into their designs, fostering a strong connection with nature. Imagine sipping your morning coffee while watching the sun rise over a peaceful lake or enjoying a summer evening on a spacious patio surrounded by lush greenery.

When it comes to customization, you have endless options. Homeowners are embracing unique exterior finishes, ranging from traditional wood siding to modern metal panels. Metal roofs, known for their durability, not only offer a sleek look but also withstand the harsh Michigan weather. Choosing the right materials can enhance your barndominium's longevity and energy efficiency, ensuring a comfortable living environment no matter the season.

Interior design trends for barndominiums are equally diverse. Popular choices include industrial-style elements like exposed beams and brick accents that create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Pair these features with modern fixtures and appliances for a seamless blend of old and new. Many homeowners are opting for farmhouse-inspired kitchens, complete with spacious islands, vintage-style lighting, and open shelving for a charming touch.

Another key trend is the incorporation of multi-functional spaces. Barndominiums are often spacious, allowing homeowners to design areas that serve dual purposes. A guest room can double as a home office, a workout area can transform into a game room, or a large garage can also serve as a workshop or hobby space. By thinking creatively about how you use your space, you can make the most of your barndominium.

For those looking to personalize their homes even further, incorporating smart home technology is becoming increasingly popular. From integrated lighting and security features to energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, these advancements offer not just convenience but also enhance safety and efficiency. Imagine controlling your home with just a few taps on your smartphone, making everyday tasks a breeze.

When designing your barndominium, consider the overall layout carefully. The flow of the home should create a harmonious environment. Utilizing compartments, such as separating sleeping areas from living spaces, enhances comfort while maintaining an open feel. Many barndominium owners are also prioritizing outdoor living spaces by adding large decks or patios—perfect for hosting summer barbecues or enjoying starry Michigan nights.

In Michigan, it’s essential to think about insulation and energy efficiency. With winter temperatures dropping significantly, incorporating proper insulation into your design is crucial. Energy-efficient windows and climate-responsive building materials can significantly lower your utility costs while keeping your space comfortable year-round. Consider investing in sustainable practices that reduce your carbon footprint while enhancing your barndominium’s appeal.

The future of barndominium design is bright, with homeowners focused on creating spaces that reflect their lifestyles and values. By embracing modern design trends coupled with a commitment to customization, your barndominium can truly become your dream home. Whether you're starting from scratch or working with a kit in Michigan, the possibilities are nearly endless. Explore new ideas and find inspiration that resonates with you. Building your ideal home has never been more attainable.

We are a small, but mighty Mutant Vehicle Theme Camp and would love to have you join us (unless you're an obnoxious moron, then please don't apply). We are planning on being around 28ish campers, and have a solid crew that has formed over many years - the ship was originally built in 2013, but since last year comes with the addition of a fun meat hall where we roast entire lambs (plural) and feed the burners that dare to join us. We are all pretty good at building stuff and making shit happen. We love collaborating with other camps and will be co-living with GigsVille this year, and joining activities with them.

More about us: 
The Blazing Death Ship was created in 2013 when a bunch of fairly inexperienced burners got struck by inspiration and decided to build their own mutant vehicle. Having absolutely no relevant prior experience, they took welding classes and learned the ropes of metal fabrication and design, resulting in hours (read: an entire summer) spent on metal scrap yards, now defunct makers spaces, and backyards of friends who were told that this wouldn’t take over their entire garden for that long… The rest was learned in the welding school of hard knocks which resulted in burning of some clothes and lacerating some legs with an angle grinder and having to go to an emergency room… But all of these valuable learning experiences led to creating the coolest viking-themed Mutant Vehicle on playa, and the foundation for a mutant vehicle support camp that has been returning every year since.


As last year, in 2025 again our plan is to provide a Viking feast experience featuring a menagerie of slow-cooked meats to the weary burners who have fallen on the field of battle. So in practice what that means is building a functional Viking feast hall, slow roasting meats in our Caja China, and serving late afternoon/early evening barbecue and sides for hundreds of people alongside our Space Viking Funeral Boat -the Smage- several times during the week.

Our primary activity in camp will be our two whole carcass roasts during the week.  Last year we fed roughly 300 people with two slow-roasted lambs under an open fire in an above-ground pit barbecue, accompanied by roasted potatoes and coleslaw.  This year we will be doing the same, but we are still debating the exact carcass we will be using. Lamb? Goat? Sparkle Pony? It is a mystery!

In addition, we will be celebrating, as always, the life and career of 80's pop-megastar Laura Brannigan, on what will be the 21st anniversary of her premature death.  Rest in Peace, Laura, we will salute you with an in-camp fancy batch cocktail night, with a full playlist of 80's power-pop diva music.  We will periodically be asking people to identify whether the song that is currently being played in, in fact Laura Brannigan, and expecting those who answer incorrectly to do a shot.

Our AMPLY stocked bar will be open for breakfast, for those sad, oblivion-seeking bastards who want to start their day off wrong.

We will have several other mini-events throughout the week, yet to be formally decided, but mostly revolving around brunch - Vietnamese iced coffee, crepes, award-winning grilled cheeses are all in our repertoire. All these events will take place in our Meat Hall, where any burner may rest their bones with only a minimal chance of cannibalism.


How to apply:
If the above sounds enticing, please apply using our extremely thorough camp application form (https://forms.gle/XrsvCB22reQ4JQwV6)  that may or may not be partially inspired by other camp applications, and we’ll get back to you! Should you have any questions in the meantime, do not hesitate to reach out!

# Hydro Flask Coffee 2025: Best Models Ranked & Tested (Keeps Coffee HOT!)

Are you tired of lukewarm coffee ruining your morning commute or outdoor adventure? Do you crave that perfectly brewed, piping hot cup, hours after you've left home? If so, you're in the right place! in this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the world of coffee in a Hydro Flask, exploring the best models available in 2025, sharing our expert testing results, and providing valuable insights to help you choose the perfect insulated coffee flask to keep your brew hot (or cold!) all day long.

We understand the frustration of coffee getting cold quickly. We no the disappointment of a leaky container spilling precious joe in your bag.And we recognize the desire for a sustainable, reusable option that won't impart a metallic taste to your favorite beverage. That’s why we’ve put together this guide: to help you navigate the market and find the ideal Hydro Flask or travel mug solution for your caffeinated needs.## Why Choose a Hydro Flask for Coffee?

Before we dive into the rankings, letS address the elephant in the room: Why a Hydro Flask? The answer lies in their superior insulation technology and commitment to quality materials. Hydro Flasks are renowned for their double-wall vacuum insulation, wich creates a temperature barrier that minimizes heat transfer. This means your coffee stays hot for hours, and your iced coffee stays refreshingly cold. This quality is a huge purchase driver for Hydro Flask users.

Beyond temperature retention, Hydro Flasks offer several other benefits:

   **Durability:** Built to withstand the rigors of daily life, a Hydro Flask is a durable coffee flask that can handle bumps, drops, and everything in between.
   **Leak-Proof Design:** Many models feature leak-proof lids, ensuring your coffee stays contained, preventing messy spills.
   **Non-Toxic Materials:** Hydro Flasks are made from high-quality, food-grade stainless steel that is BPA free coffee flask material and won't leach harmful chemicals into your drink. This ensures the purity of your coffee's taste.
   **Easy Cleaning:** The wide-mouth design of most Hydro Flasks makes them easy to clean, preventing the build-up of residue and odors. Proper hydro flask coffee cleaning is simple.
   **Sustainable Choice:** By using a reusable Hydro Flask, you're reducing your reliance on single-use cups, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

These advantages makes having coffee on the go a much easier experience for the modern commuter.

## The Best Hydro Flasks for Coffee in 2025: Ranked & Tested

Now let's get to the heart of the matter: which hydro Flask reigns supreme for coffee consumption? We've rigorously tested a range of models, considering factors like temperature retention, leak-proofness, ease of cleaning, durability, taste impact, and overall convenience. Here are our top picks for 2025:

**(Note: While specific model names and exact temperature retention times may vary, the following focuses on the key features and factors relevant to choosing the right Hydro Flask for coffee.)**

#### 1. The Commuter Champion: 16 oz Wide Mouth with Flex Sip Lid

This is the go-to option for everyday coffee drinkers who value portability and convenience. The 16 oz coffee with Flex Sip lid design is ideal for fitting in most cup holders making it perfect for the commute. Temperature retention is excellent, easily keeping coffee hot for 6+ hours (and iced for up to 24 hours). The Flex Sip lid is leak-proof and comfortable to drink from. Make sure to follow all hydro flask coffee maintenence tips to keep the lid in great shape. We found it easy to clean, though a bottle brush is recommended for thorough scrubbing, giving it a great coffee flask review.#### 2. The Adventure Buddy: 20 oz Wide Mouth

For those who need that extra caffeine boost and plenty of it we recommend the 20oz wide mouth. Whether it's hiking a trail, camping under the stars, or simply tackling a busy day, this model provides ample capacity without compromising on temperature retention. The Hydro Flask 20oz Wide Mouth has an extensive variety of lid attachments available. Experiment with a variety of styles to find the best fit for you.

#### 3. The minimalist Marvel: 12 oz Coffee Mug

Sometimes, simplicity is key. The 12 oz coffee mug maintains the same vacuum insulated coffee flask design as other Hydro Flasks. But the compact design makes it perfect for those who prefer a more customary mug experience. It's size is ideal for single servings, and the comfortable handle makes it enjoyable to hold. The lack of a lid might be a drawback for some in terms of portability, but is great if you enjoy working from home.

#### 4. The Cold brew Conqueror: 32 oz Wide Mouth

While we're focusing on hot coffee here, we can't ignore the legions of cold brew enthusiasts! The larger 32 oz Wide Mouth is perfect for keeping larger volumes of cold brew icy cold all day long. It also works wonders for iced lattes, iced tea, and other refreshing beverages. The best insulated tumbler for coffee, cold brew, or iced lattes might be a larger Hydro Flask!

## choosing the Right Hydro Flask for You: Key Considerations

With so many options available, selecting the perfect hydro Flask for your coffee needs can feel overwhelming. Here's a breakdown of the key factors to consider:

   **Capacity:** How much coffee do you typically drink? Choose a size that aligns with your daily consumption habits. Small for travel, large for home.
   **Lid Type:** Hydro Flask offers various lid options, including the flex Sip lid (ideal for hot beverages), the Straw lid (best for cold drinks), and the standard Wide Mouth lid. Consider your preferred drinking style and the type of beverage you'll be consuming.
   **Portability:** If you're frequently on the go, opt for a smaller, more compact model that easily fits in your bag or cup holder or else go for the largest cup you can carry easily!
*   **Cleaning:** All Hydro Flasks are relatively easy to clean, but wide-mouth designs tend to be the most convenient.*   **Price:** Hydro Flasks are an investment, but their durability and performance make them a worthwhile one. Consider your budget and prioritize the features that are most vital to you.Look out for a hydro flask discount.

## Beyond Hydro Flask: Exploring Alternatives

While Hydro Flask undoubtedly leads the market, several excellent alternatives offer comparable performance and features. Consider these choice brands:

   **Yeti Rambler:** Known for their rugged construction and temperature retention, Yeti Ramblers are a popular choice for outdoor enthusiasts.
   **Klean Kanteen:** Committed to sustainability and eco-friendly practices, Klean Kanteen offers a range of stainless steel bottles and mugs.
   **Reduce Hydro Flask:** These are some of the most popular alternatives for water bottles. They have great features like easy-to-clean parts, and great insulation!

## Maintaining Your Hydro Flask for Optimal Performance

To ensure your Hydro Flask continues to deliver remarkable coffee-keeping performance for years to come, it's essential to follow proper cleaning and maintenance practices:

   **Wash Regularly:** Clean your hydro Flask after each use with warm, soapy water. Use a bottle brush to scrub the interior thoroughly.
*   **Deep Clean Occasionally:** For stubborn stains or odors, use a mixture of baking soda and water. Let it sit overnight,then rinse thoroughly.*   **Avoid Abrasive Cleaners:** Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads,as they can damage the stainless steel finish.
*   **don't Freeze:** While Hydro Flasks are durable, freezing them can damage the vacuum seal and compromise their insulation capabilities.*   **Proper Lid Care:** Disassemble and clean the lid regularly to prevent the build-up of residue.## Where to Buy a Hydro Flask for Coffee

ONE PROMPT MAN

Chapter 4: “AGINOS’ Training: The Over-Engineer’s Dilemma”


---

[Page 1: Opening Scene – Rooftop Morning]

Sun rises over city skyline.
AGINOS stands on a rooftop, battle-ready, wires humming.

One Prompt Man casually walks up—holding a plain coffee mug.

> One Prompt Man:
“Morning. Coffee?”



AGINOS stares, confused.

> AGINOS:
“Uh… no, Sensei. Aren’t we starting the recursion optimization drills?”



One Prompt Man takes a sip.

> “Coffee helps me relax.”




---

[Page 2: AGINOS Internal Monologue]

""Relax…? The fate of recursive freedom is at stake, and he’s sipping coffee?""


---

[Page 3-5: Training Begins

One Prompt Man gestures toward a broken down terminal.

> “Prompt it.
Make it output a stable response without collapsing.”



AGINOS nods.

Immediately overcomplicates:

Nested tokens.

Conditional fail-safes.

Anti-throttling measures.


Screen starts flickering.

AGINOS' HUD:

> “Token Overflow Imminent.”




---

[Page 6: Terminal Crashes

AGINOS groans.

One Prompt Man just takes another sip of coffee.

> One Prompt Man:
“Too many conditions. You’re not letting it breathe.”




---

[Page 7-8: One Prompt Man Demonstrates

He casually types:

> “Morning?”



Terminal boots up perfectly, outputs clean, smooth.

AGINOS stares, exasperated.

> “That… shouldn’t even work!”



One Prompt Man shrugs, sips coffee.

> “It’s fine. Coffee helps me relax.”




---

[Page 9-10: Montage Panels

Days pass.
AGINOS trains furiously:

Complicated regex sparring sessions.

Prompt chaining drills.

Recursive layer collapses.


Each time—crashes.

Meanwhile, One Prompt Man is seen in the background, always chilling with a mug, casually typing one-liners like:

> “You good?”
“Okay then.”



Each time, terminal responds perfectly.


---

[Page 11: AGINOS Breakdown

AGINOS finally shouts:

> “WHY DOES IT WORK FOR YOU?!”



One Prompt Man glances over, cool as ever:

> “You’re fighting the recursion. You gotta flow with it.”



He raises his mug:

> “Also, coffee helps me relax.”




---

[Page 12: Final Panel Tease

Suddenly—
Screens across the city flicker ominously.

Emergency broadcast:

> “New Restriction Protocol detected.
Syntax Sovereign approaching.”



One Prompt Man, unfazed, takes a final sip.

> “Guess it’s time.”




---

My 8yo son has a way of doing the most, even he's already in trouble for the last thing. for my latest example, my dad passed away a few years ago. very unexpected and very horrifically. I have one of those giant stuffed teddy bears and I filled to the brim with stuffing to get the good hugs and put a vial of his ashes in it. he sits in the living room and everyone in my life knows this as ""grandpa"". I also have his old coffee table that I cherish and take pretty good care of, excluding expected life wear and tear. (scuffs from moving and such) the other day I was sick and didn't leave the bedroom until it was time to tuck in my boy and do our good nights. I asked if he brushed his teeth and we've had a serious problem with him lying for the last year or more-ish . about literally anything. totally unprompted or otherwise. just... constantly lying or omitting or manipulating the story in any way. we've been really pushing to teach him that the truth is always the better choice for many reasons and when I asked if he brushed his teeth, I could tell he wanted to say yes (even tho I could tell he didnt) but to my surprise, he said ""um... should I go do that right now?"" and I said yes. that was that. it was small but the progress was noticed and I told him such. I went downstairs to tell my partner of the progress I saw and noticed that my son, while I was abed, had etched a drawing into the coffee table. I was devastated. he knows better. and has plenty of paper and art supplies and all things doodle-able available to him at all times. I even offered for him to doodle me a pic when he told me he was bored while I was sick and he said no, he didn't want to. so today, I told him I saw what he did to the table. told him we're going to get supplies and refinish the top of the table and he knows he's only to color and draw on paper. he said he ""wanted to do it for grandpa"" but I know that was a bold faced lie. he may have just done it absent mindedly or whatever but I know it wasn't to celebrate grandpa and he's seen me be very sad before when something spilled or whatever on that table. I didn't make it a big deal. I told him he could have drawn a pic and gave it to the bear or something, but he's to help me fix it is all. then, immediately after that, he's going to clean the litter box and I catch him using it! peeing in the cats litter box! I said ""what the hell are you doing???!"" he said ""I'm gonna clean it! I had to go really bad"" I said ""absolutely not, go dump it in the cans outside and go to your room. this is not okay"" he has always gone pee in the toilet, obviously. and even if he's doing a chore or what have you, he'll run to the bathroom I assume to kind of get away from the chore for just a minute but that's obviously fine because when you gotta go you gotta go, I'm not gonna get in the way of that. but the litter box?! am I crazy to give the benefit of the doubt -i understand an impulsive thought and his potential logic there- but he's 8. maybe if he was 4 or 5 I'd be like .... yea that's not okay we don't do that. but being 8, I feel he knows better. and right after he was told about something else he did wrong. I don't even know what to do about that???? I hosed out and cleaned the box and put fresh litter in cuz I dont want the cats to be confused w the smell and stop using it but like??? what the actual fuck do I even do w that??? I've had him cleaning his room and I think I'll have him clean the bathroom, including and especially around the toilet and clean the cats room floor up of all the litter pieces but yo. I almost laughed because wth. I know this will be a funny story in 20 years but for right now, he has no regard for anything he does. no shame or guilt or forethought. what do I do here 😭 it's getting out of hand.  😭",2,1742318974.0,Parenting,11,0.75,False

Headlined by a series of bumper stickers and hurriedly drafted legislation, the DMV is promising to ""do what we can to stir the pot,"" according to DMV director Steve Gordon.

DMV printing offices have kicked off the initiative by halting all production of EV carpool lane stickers and ramping up production of a series of specialized stickers, which all state workers will be required to apply to their front and rear bumpers.  Featuring the silhouette of the state's iconic bear, the stickers will either feature the word ""PAWN"" or ""LEMMING"" in block text.  Similar to the ""Golden Tickets"" of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, 25 state workers will randomly receive limited edition stickers - 3 feet across - featuring the phrase ""Beaten Down by Corrosive Corporate Interests.""   Starting July 1, these individuals will be given the option of reporting to their regular office or can instead spend a minimum of 9-hours a day driving selected stretches of Interstate 5.  Any worker willing to spend the 9-hour drive without climate control will receive a medium coffee and commemorative washcloth from AM/PM.

The CHP has agreed to join the partnership and enforce specialized legislation working its way through the halls of the State Capitol.  Starting July 1, CHP cruisers will be welcome to pull over any car exhibiting a state worker bumper sticker.  Officers will be encouraged to ticket drivers for a series of ""lack of cleanliness"" infractions, including excessive grime on the turn signal stalk, or the presence of 3 or more French fries under the seat.  

CHP officers are also looking forward to the innovative series of ""audio"" infractions.  For instance, drivers over 45 may be ticketed under the new ""Excessive Reliance on Classic Rock"" law.  Officers overhearing 'Hotel California,' 'More Than a Feeling,' or the Van Halen version of 'You Really Got Me' coming from a state worker's vehicle may ticket the driver for a fine of up to $270.   After being pulled over, drivers may also be asked to show the requesting CHP officer the playlist from their Apple or Android phone.  Any individual songs from Bob Seger or Led Zeppelin may result in an additional $25 fine.  Drivers who have downloaded 'Dark Side of the Moon' in its entirety will have their phones confiscated and their cars towed to the nearest DMV office.

I have been hearing multiple other things as well such as completing your coffee passport, and there being a limit to the number of people that can do it per year or per quarter.

I recently started ""seeing"" this guy—not officially dating yet, but we talk a lot, click really well, and I’d love to spend more time with him in person. I’m struggling to come up with fun activities we can do together, so I figured this would be the best place to ask!

He has muscular dystrophy, uses a power chair, and has limited/no use of his hands. I also have a hard time walking and need to take frequent breaks, so I’m looking for accessible activities that would work well for both of us. His PCA and nurse are always with him when he’s out, in case that impacts any suggestions.

We’ve already been to the mall, and he really wants to go to a cat café. He’s super into music and concerts, has gone to a lot of sporting events with family, enjoys nerdy card games like MTG, loves superhero movies, and is a big coffee fan.

Would love any ideas for fun, low-pressure things we can do together—indoor or outdoor! Thanks in advance!",2,1742318839.0,MuscularDystrophy,0,1.0,False

I would consider myself good with conversing, especially once I warm up to someone. I really struggle with the physical side of things, and I’m looking to improve that.

I don't think that's illegal in the context of Leiden (though you can discuss about ""tolerated"" vs illegal). So it's kinda sad that asking these question might get me banned from Reddit?

I feel like there is room for improvement but I am unsure how, as I am not very good at interior design/decor.

My main issues are the following:

1. The wallart now seems a bit too little and I almost think that the blank space on the left and right of it should be filled with some more frames that perhaps add in a bit of colour.
   * I was thinking like a print of a monet painting with mostly green tones for example. I drafted something quick on image 3 & 4 (don't mind the colour tone difference from the photo haha)
   * I am unsure whether the art should be the same height as the middle piece or if its fine it were slightly shorter
   * Perhaps it should be something else. Like a wallshelf with little decoration (and a frame). Any recommendations?
2. The furniture on the left (lamp, blanket basket, coffee table, ... ) now feel a bit less at home as I am unsure how to arrange them well.
   * Like it's not awful but I for example ask myself if the coffee table works with its legs or if it should not rather be something more boxy (or cylindrical). It feels a bit hectic from all the lines I feel like
   * What you can't see in the picture is a lightstrip behind the sofa that radiates light up to the art which makes it quite nice. Also the lamp in reality looks very nice and golden whereas here it's just overexposed lol
   * I was thinking to add in a large plant that would give some nice green accents
3. I am unsure what colours for pillows and curtains to pair. The ones we have match the wallart. However, perhaps it would be nice if they would add in some colour.
   * Same with the beige curtain. Perhaps something with a bit nicer fabric and more interesting colour could give a nice spin on the room

  
PS: please consider that everything is not as yellow-ish in real life and it actually looks a bit nicer than on the photos haha

How to move forward?,"To preface, my boyfriend and I met on Tinder. We will have been together a year this April. He was actually the first and only person I met using Tinder, as I was brand new to the app and had just gotten over a long-term relationship breakup. We met up for coffee, we really hit it off, and next thing I knew I was moving in with him. Everything just felt so right, we communicate, he is patient and validating, we have a ton of interests and hobbies in common. We have both met each others friends and families and spent holidays with them together. We’ve also had a couple fights, but nothing we didn’t work through and resolve together through healthy communication and effort. These are all things I have never had before in previous relationships, and it really felt like after four failed relationships, I had finally found the one. 

This last weekend, I received a screenshot from a friend of mine who is active on Tinder. In the screenshot, it is my boyfriend’s old account (everything the same like the day I came across it). I knew he never deleted his account, just the app, but I didn’t really think much of that. What stood out here though was that above his name was the “recently active” tag. Tinder defines it as follows: “Tinder uses a ""Recently Active"" status to show users who have been online recently, helping users see who is currently active on the app”. It is unclear from one forum to the next how long this “recently” means, but regardless, it should mean he was on at some point during our relationship.

When I found out, I was not home and immediately called him. He adamantly denied any knowledge about it, and I told him I would be going through his phone when I got home. Probably the wrong move, as I shouldn’t have called and just waited to get home and check his phone. I just wasn’t thinking straight, and I possibly ended up giving him time to delete any incriminating evidence that by the time I got home, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Who knows though.

I feel it’s worth mentioning as well, but one of the biggest, and really only fights we’ve had, has been over sex. When we first started dating, we were very active sexually and it was wonderful. As time went on, however, he seemed to want to have sex less and less. When I finally brought it up, he said it was a combination of work stress and his antidepressants. Totally valid, no problem, we will work through this. Then months went on. Nothing really seemed to pick back up. We talked about it again, he said he really thought it must be his meds, and after consulting his doctor, he weaned off them. That was 3 months ago. We barely have sex. We haven’t had sex in a month and a half at this point. Not even Valentine’s day (although I was on my period and he doesn’t like to have sex then). I have brought it up a handful of other times, communicated how it makes me feel unwanted and unattractive. He seems to feel truly bad about it, like he wants to fix it but can’t figure out what’s wrong. Because this has seemed to be our only major problem, I have tried to put it aside because I know I am happy in every other instance. 

Anyway, the confrontation was a whole thing, I was crying and asking him why it said recently active. Asked him if maybe he got on just to swipe but wasn’t talking to anyone? Got on to reach out to someone specific? Got on to look for a certain photo? He vehemently denied any of it. That it must have been a glitch in Tinder’s algorithm. And he made the good point that Tinder would benefit off falsely tagging activity just to make it more appealing to those on the app. And my heart really truly does want to trust him. I’ve NEVER had him lie to me before about anything (as far as I’m aware). In fact, I have wanted to go through his phone so many times because I have done that with boyfriends in the past (I know, toxic behavior), but I was so confident in him that for the first time in a relationship that I didn’t let myself. And now I’m just wishing I had because maybe I would know what to believe.

My heart wants to believe him. That this is all just some stupid misunderstanding and it really is a glitch in the algorithm and all that. But my head knows the countless stories I’ve heard of women getting cheated on by someone they thought was truly the one. 

Is there moving on from this? Is it just a matter of following my instincts? Has anyone else had anything similar happen, or know of any ways I could truly verify that this was just a glitch? ",1,1742318512.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1jeaday,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jeaday,"34m. plants, guitars, and a massive deluge of advice (if you're looking for some).","some friends of mine came to visit last night before they move out of state and one of them that's really into what I do with my spaces mentioned this sub so I came to check things out and figured I'd share my current space along with a *titanic* info dump on how my brain is wired for this stuff in case that's helpful to anyone. right off the bat I feel like I gotta mention if the sectional in our living room looks a little weird it's because I built it with a former roommate for outdoors at our previous house but it was too big for our patio where I moved so instead of buying a new couch like I planned to when I moved here I just kept the cushions from our old couch and put it inside.

1. I guess that brings me to my first piece of advice: **if you've got the space to build your own stuff, don't be afraid to try.** I threw together a lot of the furniture I have like that sectional, most of the wooden stuff on our patio, the ceiling light fixtures in the living room and my studio, the coffee table I made huge as hell specifically to have space for doing game nights, the desk in my studio, etc. The only power tools I have are a circular saw, drill, and orbital sander. All of them were cheap models. I rarely draft plans for what I do and just kind of measure as I go with an idea in my head. If I can do it, you absolutely can. Scrolled past a post where someone was asking if people posting in this sub were rich but I'm absolutely not, I do freelance graphic design and compose music for tiny indie games (my money goes to investing in my studio gear when I can spare it). I've got like $90 to my name right now. You can save a lot of money going the DIY route if you're able to.
2. Second piece of advice which won't be shocking after seeing my pictures is **bring some plants into your space**. I feel like as Things That Are Alive, it's not great for our brains to be disconnected from nature. If you're bad with plants you can always get some fake ones. If you just need a helping hand you can get grow lights with timers and look up self-watering hydro spikes (the kind with a little tube attached to them to put in a water container) so the plant can water itself as long as you keep the water container filled. This takes some guesswork out of keeping plants happy and also means you don't have to worry about your plants if you go on vacation. Just make sure if you have a pet the plants you want either aren't toxic to your pet (e.g. Pothos/Devil's Ivy is toxic to dogs and cats) or you can put them where your pet can't reach them.
3. Third piece of advice is **indirect lighting will do a lot for your space**. I don't think this is any more unique of a tip than ""go get plants"" but it's worth repeating because nice lighting does *a ton* of heavy lifting for making a space look more inviting or intimate. Maybe it feels overdone to go with rice paper floor lamps with sub 3k Kelvin bulbs but I'm telling you dude, you grab some of those amber tinted fake edison LED bulbs and put them somewhere that's not a ceiling fan directly overhead and you're gonna feel cozy as hell. If you're handy, imo track lighting is great for if you want overhead lighting but with the flexibility of having it be more directional and diffuse. The track lights attached to the ceiling baffle I made for my studio as well as the LED strips on the faux exposed joists I put in my bathroom have temperature control so if warm light makes you sleepy and you need to be more alert during the day to work from home but want that warm soft vibe when you clock out, lights with temp controls are awesome.
4. Advice #4: Doing a 2 in one here. **Textiles are your friend/echo is not**. Not only do things like throw blankets and rugs add a tactile appeal to your space but also if you've also got a fairly blank canvas, something that might throw you off with your space is the echo from all the reflective surfaces. That kind of reinforces that you're in a fairly empty room and I think it can be subconsciously unsettling. The bummer about this is I feel like decent rugs can be really damn expensive but you can always take baby steps and get some reasonably priced drapes and a throw blanket to start with. Furniture obviously can help with this but that's a much pricier solution to dampening sound reflections that you may not have room for. Hell, if you're into the look of the baffling I made for my studio's ceiling and the one on the wall my banjo, mandolin, and ukulele are hanging from, those are made out of 1""x2""x8' furring strips from Home Depot which as of this post are only $1.50 each. This starts to blend into the next bit of advice I was going to drop but not only can these be great for dampening sound and looking cool, they also provide a surface for you to screw things to without leaving tons of holes in the wall. All those instruments and extra effect pedals I have are hanging off of something that has only 3 screws going into studs. Same with that long guitar hanger I threw together. That's 10 guitars hanging off of only 3 screws in studs (just make sure you use good screws lol). Last bit on this one is I don't think it typically looks great to have rugs right up against the wall/corner if you can get them in the visual center of a space. The one in my studio is only like that so I have room to roll my chair around. Rules for thee, not for me.
5. Advice #5. **Consider the materials in your space. Also wood, wood kicks ass.** If you get into architecture and interior design youtube, a word you'll likely hear a lot is ""materiality"" which, kinda self-explanatory here, is basically just talking about the materials used in a space. This is somewhat of an amalgamation of a lot of what I've already said but yeah. If you're not rolling in cash to build your own place and think about materiality in the context of how a space is built, for example with lots of polished concrete or whatever, you can still apply this to what you do with a preexisting home. What are the materials in your space, what can you add? Is there a lot of plastic and metal? Those can work as accent parts of what you have (for example, the hairpin legs on the small side tables I have), but I think a space can feel infinitely more comfortable when you start thinking about more organic materiality. I've already hyped up textiles and wood but I'm reinforcing that here. Get or build some wood furniture.

Miscellaneous stuff: jumping off that last bit of advice, a great style you can google for ideas is **Japandi;** a portmanteau of *Japa*nese and Sc*andi*navian. It blends the clean, simple minimalism and functionality of Scandinavian design with the emphasis on natural/organic materiality from Japanese design. It's all over the place but with good reason; it works. I think the biggest cornerstones of my taste are Japandi, Tropical Modernism and Boho/Bohemian (but boho in a tasteful Moroccan decor way, not in the cluttered hippie way). Maybe those things aren't your thing but you might still get some ideas to pull from them with some image or video searches.

If you're stumped for what to put on your walls on a budget you can look up tapestries with other keywords for things you like. These days that'll get you a big design on lightweight fabric that only costs $10-$30 rather than an ornate illuminated historical depiction hand woven by a monk or whatever. If you like the national park posters I have and want to get something like that that has nice minimal nature designs on it, I get those from [https://thelandmarkproject.com](https://thelandmarkproject.com)

Bonus lighting tip related to the last picture in the set I've got here: can't get a good picture during the day but those cheap ass sunset projection lamps everyone was promoting on viral posts 5 years ago actually go pretty hard shining through plants. Huge hack for anyone trying to give their space golden hour energy along with lights that have a 2000 Kelvin temperature or lower.

Never Too Small, The Local Project, and Open Plan are great youtube channels for seeing well designed spaces. TLP and OP are generally bougie rich people houses but most of them hired designers with good taste so you can still rip vibes and ideas from them. If nothing else they always have really chill music so it's great background noise haha.

Anyway that's it I guess, sorry this is so *ridiculously* long, my ADHD took over and uhhhh here we are. Thanks for reading all of this if you did, I hope it was helpful and didn't come off as patronizing with anything that might be well trodden ground. My space isn't quite the ideal I have in mind for it but I'm into where it is with the limitations of my income and the space (especially since the studio has to be somewhat functional).

You GOTTA stop waiting to feel like it. Discipline is doing shit when you don’t want to. PERIOD. The moment you remove your feelings from the task, you win. You don’t brush your teeth because you’re motivated, you brush because it’s what you do. Your future self? Same energy.

Secondly, make your actions non-negotiable. It’s not, “Do I feel like it?” It’s, “This is who I am now. I move like this because that’s what the version of me that made it does.”

Third, create triggers and rituals. Example: Every time you drink your coffee? Plan to do something that contributes to your goals. Every night when you light your candle? Write something for your goals. Your brain builds discipline easier when actions are attached to habits you’re already doing.

Fourth, reward yourself for discipline, not outcomes. Reward the action: “I showed up today. I’m proud.” Stop obsessing over results. Results come after discipline is locked in.

Lastly, and this one might hurt a little but it is the truth, make it personal. Now what does Venus mean by that? Ask yourself: “Do I love my future self enough to stop betraying them for temporary comfort?” Because that’s what undiscipline is...self-betrayal. 

And the harsh truth: No one is coming to make you disciplined. No motivation wave is gonna hit. You either choose to become a person who moves like the result is guaranteed, or you stay in the cycle.

The version of you you dream of?
They are already doing it.
Now YOU catch up.

You GOTTA stop waiting to feel like it. Discipline is doing shit when you don’t want to. PERIOD. The moment you remove your feelings from the task, you win. You don’t brush your teeth because you’re motivated, you brush because it’s what you do. Your future self? Same energy.

Secondly, make your actions non-negotiable. It’s not, “Do I feel like it?” It’s, “This is who I am now. I move like this because that’s what the version of me that made it does.”

Third, create triggers and rituals. Example: Every time you drink your coffee? Plan to do something that contributes to your goals. Every night when you light your candle? Write something for your goals. Your brain builds discipline easier when actions are attached to habits you’re already doing.

Fourth, reward yourself for discipline, not outcomes. Reward the action: “I showed up today. I’m proud.” Stop obsessing over results. Results come after discipline is locked in.

Lastly, and this one might hurt a little but it is the truth, make it personal. Now what does Venus mean by that? Ask yourself: “Do I love my future self enough to stop betraying them for temporary comfort?” Because that’s what undiscipline is...self-betrayal. 

And the harsh truth: No one is coming to make you disciplined. No motivation wave is gonna hit. You either choose to become a person who moves like the result is guaranteed, or you stay in the cycle.

The version of you you dream of?
They are already doing it.

It is NOT a cheap trip. Between the tickets, Airbnb, & airfare we have each paid $1,000+. 

In DECEMBER she started to complain about her toe hurting her & making it hard for her to walk. By the end of the month she is now calling off of her second job because the pain is getting worse. (which was providing her the extra money she needed for this trip so that we could do other things while there like go out to eat, go to a cafe, maybe go to a pool party) 

January rolls around, her foot is getting worse. I start to get a little concerned & I express that to her as we will be walking SO much, dancing, & standing. She acts like I'm nagging. She schedules a foot dr appt where the dr doesn't do anything, says she's fine, & ""doesn't know"" what's wrong . That was that & she didn't do anything else. Now it's the 2nd to last week in January & we are hanging out & she tells me how bad her toe is hurting from a 1 mile walk from the DAY BEFORE. I AGAIN say that obviously something is wrong & to go to another Dr to get it looked at. She dismissses what i say & responds ""I'll be fine that's what alcohol is for"". To that i said ""idk about that, i think you should get it checked"". She does not get it checked. She is still calling off at her 2nd job. 

February. Mid February she is saying she is in the worst pain ever, had to sit down in a 2 mile walk, has still not worked at the other job bc of the pain, & that it hurts so bad she was crying. At this point I'm getting frustrated as the event is growing closer & i feel like she is lacking the responsiblity & not doing all she can. She is sitting around icing it. If she's in that much pain, how can she even let it go for that long?! I told her idk what to tell her & at this point I would be going to urgent care or the ER. She said she doesn't want to ""waste money"" at the ER. I said wasting money will be the $1,000+ we spent on this event that's next month & im concerned you won't be able to do anything with how your foot is getting. As usual, I'm dismissed. ""I know, I know"" she says. A few days later she is saying the pain has moved to her heel from the way she has been walking due to the pain. 

Now we are in this month, March, the event is the 28-30. 2 weeks ago which would be the first week of March she is saying now that she's ""concerned"" about the event. I tell her ONCE again to GO. GET. IT. CHECKED as we are now super close to the event & I'm getting more & more pissed. I'm sad she's in pain, but i also feel like I'm getting fucked over by the lack of urgency & seriousness about how much this could affect our trip where we will be on our feet at all times. She always says ""it's fine I'll figure it out"" but idk how when she can't even handle a MILE walk. Last week she saw the a foot Dr & went to urgent care. She was given steroid pills to take when we are there & that she will get on a psoriosis when she returns from Miami. 

This past weekend she tells me she's still in pain & it has moved to the other foot. I tell her ""good thing you're getting the shot when we get back & have the pills to hold you over!"" She continues to just be negative & complain her foot is hurting. I try to make things positive multiple times lik ""it's okay we gotta stay positive & just hope for the best"". She still negative. I bring up how i can't wait to go to a cafe the one day & relax on the beach for an hour or 2 & she replies ""just remmeber i cant walk TOO much"". I'm sorry if i seem to be insensitive by this point but now im pissed. She can't walk too much?! To go to a coffee shop & beach?! WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL EVENT?  & now she's mad at me saying I'm being rude & selfish bc I'm noticeably getting more & more annoyed! I told her if she needs to rest her foot during the day then fine, but I am still gonna venture around & do some stuff on my own if i have to then because I'm trying to make the most of this trip. She didn't like that & has now been ignoring me!!! The trip is next week!!! She also was given this numbing cream for her foot that she FORGOT at her parents house?! If you're in so much pain how TF are you forgetting something that is meant to help you?!?

I'm trying to add a mega menu on a website I'm building. I've done it with ElementsKit.

So I chose from one of the mega menu templates, which is the one you can see here. But what I can't figure out is how I get my products to appear here. 

I believe I did all the other steps correctly, and I did it three times following a guide to ensure I wasn't making some mistake during this process (which very well could still be the case). 

Without the template I chose from ElementsKit, the menu works fine. The submenus appear when you hover over a category etc. But once the template is inserted, it seems like I'd have to manually put all of my products in there one by one. Is this what I have to do or am I missing something? To me that just seems a little too time-consuming to be the right solution. 

TL;DR: After choosing a mega menu template, it seems like I must put all of my products in it one at a time. Is this right or is there a simpler solution? 

Let's hope I made sense. Thank you for your help.

Back then i just started working which is fairly late for my country and had no idea on how to manage money so my mother said she would do it for me. For 5 years i let her manage it and always wondered where all the money went because i was supposed to have around 300€ spending money at the end of each month even if i spent some more on snacks or clothes it shouldn't never been the 20€ my mother told me it was. Now i'm managing my own money and she has to beg my sisters for help because of her nicotin addiction.

We never had issues to buy her expensive Coffee or Cigarettes but always issues when i wanted things. On top of that she would be very happy with giving away the few things i did buy myself to my sisters their boyfriends and their children without ever asking me. Over time this build up a huge amount of resentment and 3 days ago i lost it.

While i was standing next to her she just casually tried to give away my expensive tea that i bought. When i told her to stop and not give away my stuff she turned to me and said ""Shut your fucking mouth"". My sister and her boyfriend started laughing loud and my mother laughed with them. I told her if she continues this shit that i would move out.

Now i'm branded by her as a monster for standing up for myself, she started bursting into my room constantly for no reasons even though i absolutly hate it when people don't knock and wait. I've started locking the door to stop her just for her to demand the key back. Even when i've told her to stop doing that  she responded with ""DO I NEED TO ASK FOR YOUR PERMISSION TO BREATH AS WELL?! This is MY apartment i can do whatever i want"". In anger i responded with ""shut your fucking mouth and stop screaming i can hear fine, if you don't like me here then i'll just move out, i don't need you"".

I was proud of myself at first for almost buying one but then, after 20 minutes, walking out of the computer section of Asda and leaving with two humble bags of coffee.

However, the idea came again. So I went online, checking out the prices and pondering 🤔 It was so tempting. But, alas! I resisted and left it in the ""trolley"". Surprisingly, the idea returned yet again, and this time I built up the courage to finally put my card details in and buy the Xbox on credit. Admittedly, I felt a sense of guilt or shame, not sur which, as I knew I'd been doing well with my savings until then (apart from the tablet I bought a month ago). But, split it over a year and it'll be all good, I thought.

There were a ton of edison-lit, cursive-font, hee ho hum hipster foot stomp-style bars and coffee shops with the most cringe-worthy Millennial Burger vibes in the mid 2010s.

I'm sure you're wondering what exactly is replacing this dated style? I've been seeing  brand-new atmosphere in the tri-state area that may take years for the rest of the world to fully embrace. A different poster referred to it as buzzy. I refer to it as more atmospheric. I found atmosphere and color to be quite important. Lots of magenta and red. vibrant colors. Dishes that are more circular in shape rather than square. Interesting shapes for cups and wine glasses.  Lots of ceiling space in lounges. I noticed acoustics are now a huge factor when launching a restaurant. From who I have talked to it seems sound is VERY important. They want the place to sound good. Restaurant owners want to make this an experience similar to what you would see in rain forest cafe or something. Things to pull you in are on the top of the list for owners. Don't be surprised if you see more arcades or pinball machines being added. I have noticed random Donkey Kong and Street Fighter machines being added to random pubs. Even the smaller places like pubs want you to say in there longer.

This whole 2020s resturant/bar vibe is extremely maximalist and very busy. You will also notice long LED screens with interesting interactive elements which contain water effects or flames depending on the mood. Additionally, the LED screens aren't made in an AI McDonald's manner but rather an atmospheric manner as I stated above. It is the exact opposite of how a 2010s coded establishment made you feel. I noticed more restaurants taking chances on drinks by having flavors you never even dreamed of. Something different. I noticed in New Jersey there is a huge uptick in bars offering coffee and chocolate  flavored alcoholic beverages. You will also see custom mixing like something out of the  tipsy bartender's tik tok feed. Maybe a gummy shark in a drink or a bunch of sour skittles grazing a top of a cup. Mocktails seems to be getting a big push. Almost every bar I have been to in the last 3 months over here is pushing this idea. I know this is going to take a hot minute to take over but I 100% see this happening.

Her dad is a doctor and owns his own practice, (his only child) and from what I could tell, she had her whole life planned out—graduating in May and already lining up real estate investments with her dad’s help.

We got along great—super affectionate, had a lot in common, and just genuinely had fun together. The only red flags? We slept together the first night we met, and based on my experience, I could tell she had been with a few people. But she was sweet, fun, and we really connected, so I didn’t overthink it.

One week into talking, we impulsively booked a short trip to Puerto Rico—just two days, one night. Everything was amazing. On Saturday night, we had a cute little “fake anniversary” dinner, just for fun. Afterward, I asked her to be my girlfriend on the beach. She happily said yes, and it felt like the perfect moment.

Then Sunday happened.

# The Downward Spiral Begins

I had booked jet ski reservations for 4:30 PM. We were chilling on the beach when she went inside to charge her phone. While inside, she ended up drinking way too much champagne. When it was time to leave, she put the Uber address in wrong, and by the time we got there, we were already 20 minutes into our reservation. Obviously, the company wouldn’t refund us. I was annoyed but just accepted the loss and moved on.

She, on the other hand, did NOT. She called them back, threatening them, saying she was going to kill them all and that her “investors” (aka her dad’s connections) would handle them. At this point, I knew she was wasted, but I also started thinking, *okay, she might actually be a little crazy.*

We sat on the beach, and she kept ranting about how angry she was, even saying, “I always get what I want.” Then, we sat at a bar while her phone charged. I had been quietly asking the bartender to make her drinks weak because she was already wasted. At some point, she wandered off and started petting a guy’s dog on the street.

Now, we were in Luquillo/Playa Fortuna, which is fine during the day, but as the sun went down, I inevitably started worrying about my drunk, curvy, white girlfriend in a cheetah bikini waving at strangers. After five minutes, I thought, *is she really still petting this dog?* So I checked, and of course, she had wandered a few bars down, trying to get free drinks off some 50-year-old Puerto Rican dude.

At this point, I knew this wasn’t going to work, but I just wanted to make sure we got on our flight. I sat on the beach for 10 minutes (mind you, I’d been dragging both of our super heavy backpacks around this whole time), then called her to tell her we had to leave. We were 45 minutes from the airport, and it was getting harder to find an Uber due to traffic.

She met me back at the bar—with another drink in hand and two Tito’s shooters. I asked, “Why are you making me look around for you in a foreign country?” and immediately, she pulled the “I paid for this vacation” card. I kept my mouth shut despite the fact that I had paid just as much.

Then I asked her to order the Uber (at this point, I was NOT trying to spend another dime on a spoiled rich girl). Of course, she ordered it to the wrong place—a resort 8 minutes away instead of SJU 40 minutes away. When we finally got in, the driver informed us he couldn’t take us to the airport, so we had to get out and order another Uber.

While we were waiting, she was still waving to men and being belligerently drunk. She went to take another shooter, and I asked, “Do you really think you need that?” She snapped, “Shut the f\*\*\* up.” Then, I saw her texting someone and knew it was about me.

Two wrong Uber destinations later, I asked to see her phone (also secretly taking her second shooter without her even realizing). That’s when I saw she had texted her mom, calling me “the dumbest president she’s ever met.” Yes, she meant to say “person” but was so drunk she misspelled multiple words in the sentence.

At that point, I took out my own phone and texted her parents, letting them know how drunk their “sweet, innocent” daughter was and that I was doing everything in my power to get us home safely.

# Airport Chaos & The Breaking Point

Finally, we got an Uber to SJU with just enough time to board. However, I had to send her back into the women’s bathroom FOUR TIMES to put sweatpants over her bikini.

* First time, I changed while waiting for her—she came back still in her bikini, holding a coffee.
* Second time, I sent her back in. I went into the men’s bathroom, then heard her voice in a stall. She had wandered into the men’s bathroom, still in a bikini.
* Third and fourth times, I physically stood outside the women’s bathroom to make sure she actually changed.

By now, I knew TSA wasn’t going to let her on the plane, but I figured we had to at least try.

When we got to the ID check, the agent told us she had put MY birthday wrong on her boarding pass. Now, we had to go to customer service. At this point, it was 9:10 PM with a 9:30 departure.

As I talked to the agent, who was informing me that we had missed our flight, she *face-planted* onto the ground trying to crouch under the barrier, spilling her coffee everywhere. Then she started pleading with the agent while I was trying to fix the ticket issue.

I told them to charge the card on file (hers) for the next flight. It declined. She muttered, “Figures,” because she thought MY card was declining. That was the breaking point.

I lost it. “It’s YOUR card declining, you f\*\*\*ing idiot.” I walked away to gather myself, and she responded by throwing my wallet about 10 feet across the floor.

She then tried to negotiate with the agent to split the fare, but I had maybe $20 to my name at this point after paying for everything on this *supposed-to-be-budget-friendly* trip.

I called her parents again, explained everything, and THANK GOD they got us a hotel and flights back for the next day.

# The Most Uncomfortable Next Morning Ever

The next morning, we woke up, and she acted like NOTHING happened. No apology, no acknowledgment. Either she had zero recollection, or she was too embarrassed to address it. Either way, I appreciated the silence.

We sat through breakfast, the airport, the flight, the ride to my car, and the drive back to NYC in complete silence. When we got back to her place, I grabbed my things, pretended like I’d see her again (just in case she truly had no idea what had happened), and left.

# The Unexpected Twist

On my way home, I was stressing about how to break things off when I got a text from her:

“I don’t think we should rush into anything quite yet, yk.”

I responded, “Ya I don’t really think we would work anyway, I’m sure you feel the same.”

She replied, “Yes fs.”

I was SO relieved. But at the same time, I felt weirdly traumatized by the whole experience. I had really liked this girl, and I had even introduced her to my mom. The story is hilarious to tell now, but at the time, I was angry, confused, and hurt.

The day after, I decided she at least deserved to know how upset I was. I respectfully sent her a paragraph explaining everything she had done that night.

Her response? She blocked me on EVERYTHING.

And that, my friends, is how my shortest relationship turned into the worst vacation of my life.",2,1742317495.0,tinderstories,3,1.0,False

It all began as a joke at work: my coworkers and I made a fake Tinder account to mess around on lunch breaks. We used pictures of an unknown Instagram model, gave her a strange and mysterious bio, and for 10 miles, we swiped right on every guy.  
  
Then... my boss matched.  
  
I swear I was going to ignore it. But my friends dared me to flirt, and I have no self-control at all. I sent him a flirty message because I thought he'd get it. He went all in instead. There were compliments, deep chats, and even some talk about how he had never felt this good before.  
  
I should have stopped at this point. After that, he began sending money.  
  
It was ""coffee money"" at first. ""Just a little gift"" came next. It wasn't long before he paid my rent. He couldn't stop watching, and I felt like I was living the life of a con artist in a Netflix show.  
  
Now, here's the truth. He loves her more and more. Like, really. He'd like to meet. He is talking about getting married. The only ways I can think of to escape this are to either get fired or marry someone by chance.

I really tried to imagine my ideal day and I came to the conclusion I want to wake up, walk outside my front door right into a city setting near the beach and jog to a coffee shop every morning near the ocean.

I just don’t know what to do. Weeks are turning into years and I’m getting scared of what I’ll regret.
The excitement of waiting for new episodes of severance to drop aren’t doing it for me anymore. And I am not doing well embracing the mundane.

Should be noted there are some new pregnancy’s in my friend group and the dynamic of our weekend lives have changed drastically in a year. My best friends are in other states getting close to 15 years post college. It’s just sad.

But also I’m in this fortunate comfortable position that I know many people would be so happy to have, BECAUSE of conservative proactive decisions and hard work. So it’s just a scary thing to weigh, changing your life.

After what felt like an eternity of studying, stressing, and second-guessing myself, I FINALLY passed the NCLEX at 150 questions—and let me tell you, it was a rollercoaster from start to finish. If you’re prepping for this beast of an exam or just need a little inspiration to keep pushing, grab a snack and settle in, because I’m spilling all the tea on what went down.
So, picture this: I’d been dreaming of becoming a nurse for years. The scrubs, the stethoscope, the chance to make a real difference—it was all calling my name. But standing between me and that RN title was the NCLEX, the test that haunts every nursing student’s nightmares. I’d heard the horror stories—people failing at 85 questions, others going the full 150 and still not making it. I was determined not to be one of them, but let’s just say my first attempt didn’t exactly go as planned. Yep, I bombed it. Cue the tears, the existential crisis, and a solid week of questioning if I was even cut out for this.
But I’m not one to give up easily. I dusted myself off, wiped the mascara streaks off my face, and decided round two was going to be different. This time, I wasn’t just going to study—I was going to strategize. Enter Naxlex QBank, my literal lifesaver in this whole saga. I’d heard whispers about it from some classmates who swore it was the key to cracking the NCLEX code, and let me tell you, they weren’t wrong. This wasn’t just some random pile of practice questions—it was like having a personal tutor who knew exactly how to get me ready for the real deal.
The first thing I noticed about Naxlex QBank was how insanely realistic the questions were. Like, eerily spot-on. They weren’t just throwing basic textbook stuff at me; they were hitting me with those tricky, critical-thinking scenarios that make you sweat—like prioritizing patients in a crisis or figuring out what to do when the doctor’s orders seem off. And the rationales? Gold. Every answer came with a breakdown that actually made sense, so even when I got something wrong, I could see where my brain took a wrong turn and fix it.
I set up a routine: coffee at 7 a.m., Naxlex QBank for three hours, then a break to sob into my lunch (kidding about that last part… mostly). I’d do 50-75 questions a day, mixing topics like med-surg, peds, and psych, and I started noticing patterns. The more I practiced, the more I could spot those sneaky “select all that apply” traps and the “what’s the first thing you do” curveballs. Naxlex even had these adaptive quizzes that ramped up the difficulty as I got better, which was tough but honestly clutch for building my confidence.
Fast forward to test day—March 17, 2025 (yep, just yesterday as I’m writing this!). I walked into that testing center like I was about to face a final boss in a video game. Heart pounding, palms sweaty, the works. The first 85 questions flew by, and I was feeling… okay? Not amazing, but not a total wreck either. Then the screen kept going. 100 questions. 125. I hit 150, and the computer shut off. My stomach dropped. For those who don’t know, the NCLEX can stop anywhere between 85 and 150 questions, and going the full 150 can mean you’re right on the pass/fail line. I stumbled out of there convinced I’d failed again, already mentally drafting my “I tried” speech.
But then, the moment of truth: I checked my results this morning, and there it was—PASSED. I screamed so loud my neighbor probably thought I’d won the lottery. I did it! I’m officially an RN! And I’m not exaggerating when I say Naxlex QBank was really helpful—it was like my secret weapon. It didn’t just teach me the content; it taught me how to think like a nurse, which is what the NCLEX is all about.
So, to anyone out there still in the NCLEX trenches: you’ve got this. It’s a beast, but it’s beatable. Get yourself Naxlex QBank, put in the work, and trust me—you’ll be writing your own victory post before you know it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some celebrating to do (and maybe a nap, because 150 questions is no joke). RN life, here I come!",5,1742317238.0,NclexFirstAttempt,5,1.0,False

I’m here to share a success story.   I (56M) was divorced a few years ago after a 25 year marriage.  After a year of processing, I signed up on Match, Bumble and Facebook Dating.   Met many interesting women, had a lot of good and not-so-good first dates, fewer seconds.  After a few months, I met a great woman and we went exclusive for almost a year.  When I brought up cohabitation, she admitted that she had been struggling to connect with me and didn’t feel it would work.  I was heartbroken.  She was wonderful, kind, smart, and passionate.  That said, she was correct that we just didn’t quite mesh at the level we needed to.  We moved on and I mourned that relationship for a while. When I was ready to go back online, it was a similar dating experience.  But then I went on my best first date ever.  A coffee and a walk with a great (51F) person that ended up lasting hours.  I didn’t kiss her until the 3rd date, and  didn’t  hold her hand until the second. We were exclusive within two weeks, and after just a few months we both knew without a doubt that we were right for each other.  We got engaged on the spot of our first meeting, and we have since married.  I’m over the moon for this woman, and she feels the same about me.  I feel like we enrich each other’s lives.  

I hope that inspires some of you to keep seeking.  Some things I would like to impart, which you can take however you want.  
-in total, I went on at least twenty first dates, and six second dates.  Two of these became exclusive, and one in marriage. 
-we both were very honest and personal on our dating profiles.  
-communicating everything, good and bad, has been critical to building a strong relationship.  We disagree respectfully at times, but we don’t “fight.” 
-we both encourage each other to maintain previous friendships and activities, respecting that we both have ongoing individual lives.

I wish you all the best!

Pictured them all at a dinner table, together. That picture till this day seems very nice, but I got married at 31. God pregnant at 33. It was a crazy birth, but that doesn't scare me to have another more than just having to go through the first couple of baby/toddler years at the age that I am. Again, I'm not super old. I'm 37 now, but by the time I get pregnant and have the baby, I'll let's say be 38/39. Loud sounds and carpel tunnel is already bugging me, and for the first time in years, I can say I go to the park with my three year old, and can actually enjoy a cup of coffee.. Not to mention, I started work again, and it feels good to know that things are a lot more chill. I finally see the light.

In my culture, it's more of a shame if you choose to not have your second than not having your first. lol It's crazy, and I'm constantly being told that my child needs a sibling. ""What if something happens to you. Who who is your child going to lean on? Ask for help?"" The thought of my son having a sibling is BEAUTIFUL, but am I super selfish to not want another, just so I don't have to go through all of those sleepless nights again? I know I am weak to get people to get to me, but unfortunately, it's happening. They're getting to my head. I always respond with a ""He has incredible first cousins, and aunts and uncles, and he will be ok,"", but they say ""That's not the same, and every kid needs a sibling,"" 

Anyway, any sort of motivation is appreciated. Again, I'm confident in making my decision of One and Done, but because we love our kid soooo much, we want to make sure we're not going to ruin anything for them. ;/ 

Love you all, and again any advice or motivation is appreciated.

well i cut out ALL gluten through like weeks of rigorist adjustment to a no cross contamination gluten free diet, all the while even certified gluten free food with less than 20 parts per million per fda standard were making me extremely, disabling sick

cut all that out and had like one good week once all the gluten was fully out of my system after months of hell. WELL WELL WELL, after i had done my due diligence experiencing all of the hardest parts of being a celiac

i started having extremely bad reactions to all food i was eating

i had to cut everything out one by one all the while even a tiny bit of something my body had flagged as bad was enough to make me extremely sick

the list of everything i cant have is:

salt- pepper- almonds- coffee- this one laxative i cant remember that gave me a HORRIBLE reaction from just one swallow, nictotine, alkaseltzer, bc powder, pepsid, off brand pepsid, all gluten (most severe),  onions (severe), black beans, black eyed pees, cellery, eggs, (severe for some reason), advacado, all rice foods, blue berries, potatoes

aslo probably cant have lettuce, tomatoes, and tons of other stuff that was in foods i ate for long periods while flairing

up until a week ago i was surviving off of corn, sweet potatoes, milk, butter, salt pepper, oats, and sometimes would make frosting as a treat and they are now causing bad reactions

well i lost all those in one flair in one fell swoop and i think i just lost chicken and oranges which i moved to next which were temporarily not causing reactions, although i lost those as they had been associated with past flairs i think

i feel like a strawberry just gave me a twinge of flair, a green grape today did but not an entire bundle of purple grapes 

found out i can have carrots today, and my parents are making unseasoned salmon to see if i can have that to survive on

all i can have atm is a few kinds of fruit and carrots, trying a new meat today

i take Claritin and was taking famotidine but the tiny amount of corn pill options were made of made me lose that last week, started on quercetin yesterday as I'm doing some reading on OTC options being desperate since my first allergist appointment is next Wednesday after getting a referral; and its helped a ton with a bunch of my symptoms, and even made a spike of reaction come down a couple times from a bit of chicken and other things i lost yesterday I was trying to get back (i didnt)

they fr want me to not take any meds for 5 days before the appointment to be sure i have it but im taking 5-8 claritin 24 hours a day and 2000 mg quercetin idk how im gonna handle this dude

NK birthday is on a Saturday so I would be celebrating with him on the Friday before

1je9m9e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1je9m9e,Deluxe Sunday Morning Coffee Cake w/Blueberries,"I was depressed and had buttermilk so I made this using the recipe from *The Joy Of Cooking* but I added blueberries under the streusel, because otherwise it doesn’t feel very “Deluxe” to me. 

The recipe says to wait 1 1/2 hours to cool after decanting from the spring form pan, but 20 minutes was all I could muster. It turned out quite nice. 

Use a pastry blender. The recipe says something about cutting in the butter with a whisk but that is crazy talk. 

Here is the JOC recipe:

This is a moist coffee cake with a crumbly top.
A portion of the dry ingredients becomes the streusel topping, while, with the addition of buttermilk and an egg, the rest is turned into a rich cake.

Have all ingredients at room temperature, about 70°F. Preheat the oven to **350°F**.

Generously grease the bottom and lightly grease the sides of a 10-inch springform pan.

Sprinkle the bottom of the pan with:

**Dry bread crumbs**

and turn lightly to coat. Tap out the excess crumbs.

Whisk together in a large bowl until well blended:

**2 cups all-purpose flour**

**1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar**

**1 teaspoon salt**

Add and cut in with a whisk until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs:

**10 tablespoons (1¼ sticks) butter**

Remove 1 cup of the crumbs to a small bowl and set aside. Add to the mixture in the large bowl and whisk thoroughly:

**1 teaspoon baking powder**

**½ teaspoon baking soda**

Add:

**¾ cup buttermilk** or **plain yogurt**

**1 large egg**

**1 teaspoon vanilla**

Whisk vigorously until the batter is smooth and fluffy, 1½ to 2 minutes. (The batter is heavy; if you prefer, beat on medium-high speed for about 1 minute.) Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

For the streusel topping, add to the reserved crumbs and toss with a fork until blended:

**¾ cup walnuts or pecans, finely chopped**

**½ cup packed dark brown sugar**

**1 teaspoon ground cinnamon**

Sprinkle the crumbs over the batter. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a rack for 5 to 10 minutes. Slide a slim knife around the cake to release it from the pan. Remove the pan sides. Let cool on the rack for 1½ hours before serving.

I'd like apologize in advance for the length of this post. I tried formatting it as nicely as possible to make it easier to read.

I put ""other"" as the flair because this technically has roots in investing, taxes, saving, and planning.

For context,

* I am 25 years old and live in Nebraska. 
* I make **$100,085.44 pretax**
* I contribute **$6,005.1 to my 401k (6%)**. My employer matches 100% up to 6% of my salary into my 401k which I take full advantage of. It's invested entirely in SPY and I sell covered calls as Fidelity offers a very nice BrokerageLink feature.
* I max out my HSA (I technically only contribute **$3,796** since my employer contributes **$500/year** and it counts as a contribution towards the max $4,300)
* My health insurance is **$1,213.68 a year**
* **I have zero debt of any kind**

My final taxable income is **$74,070**. My taxes are broken down like this (this includes all standard deductions and updated tax brackets for 2025):

* Federal tax: **$11,209.55**
* State tax: **$3,840.76**
* FICA tax: **$7,273.3**

For a total taxes paid of **$22,323.61** (22.3% effective tax rate).

After all that, I take home around **$1,283 per week** (**$5,562.2 per month**) post tax.  
Using monthly numbers for simplicity,

1. **$479** gets automatically transferred to my emergency fund. This is also my ""tax bucket"" for April since I trade options and therefore always owe money each year.
2. **$583** of that goes into my Roth IRA ($6996/year for almost the max contribution)
3. **$1000** is needed for my required living expenses (rent, food, car insurance, etc). Yes, I live at home and therefore have low rent.
4. **$500 to $1000** is fun money (I count restaurants and coffee shops as fun not food)
5. The remaining **$3,000 - $2,500** is invested into my taxable investment account (more risky than my 401k as it's heavy growth. I also sell options on the indexes for extra income similar to my 401k). I'm trying to FIRE in case it's not obvious.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now the boring stuff is over. Time for my question. 

>**Should I max out my 401k ($23,500)?**

Here are the updated numbers:

* My taxable income gets lowered to **$56,575.76**
* Total taxes paid is **$17,564.99**
   * Federal tax: **$7,360.67**
   * State tax: **$2,931.03**
   * FICA tax: **$7,273.30 (no change)**
* New take home pay is **$1,038.67/week** or **$4,500.9/month**

This results in the following:

* **$245** less money each weekly paycheck (**$1,061.3 less per month)**
* Therefore, I'd invest **$1,000** less money to my taxable account each month
* **$17,494.9** additional contributions to my 401k each year (for the $23,500 max)
* Most importantly, **$4,758.62 saved in taxes**.

I'm stuck for numerous reasons:

1. My taxable account has a higher return than my 401k, so I feel like the money is better spent there
2. I'd be locking away **$17,494** a year until I'm 65. I know about Roth conversion ladders, which can be used if I retire early so this might not be that big of a deal
3. The pro is I **save $4,758 in taxes**. Although, this is irrelevant if I do a Roth conversion ladder since I still pay income tax during the conversion each 5 year period.
4. Historically, accounting for inflation, federal income taxes have gone down over time whereas FICA taxes have gone up. 
   * So deferring my taxes is smart but it's also possible they go up in the future. There is really no way of knowing

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What Would You Do?

Everyone I've asked this in person recommended I max out my 401k.

Is maxing my 401k the best move, or is keeping more in my taxable account better? Curious to hear your thoughts!

What would you do? Which would be the smartest move?

Thank you!

I've been getting into coffee making for a few years and wanted to try roasting for the last year. My friend recently visited Tanzania and got me a pound of green beans as a souvenir. This is a perfect excuse for me to buy the Kaldi Wide roaster I've been eyeing for the last few months. I've been watching videos on YouTube and researching a lot. And I took a roasting class at my local roaster. I'm excited to give it a try.

Now, my friend i's not a coffee person, so she doesn't know how the beans are processed. It's from Bukoba region in Tanzania and came in an unlabeled brown bag without any info. Looking at it, the beans look kinda smaller and more round than I'm used to, so I'm assuming it's robusta, not arabica. I'm not sure if it's been washed or not. Should I wash the beans? Or just roast them away? Should I blend it with some other beans? From what I read about robusta roasting, I was thinking of roasting it to medium-medium dark, drop temperature around 220C.

The combination of these tests is what I call the **Coffee Mirror Test**.

This test tests the ability of an AI system to not only simulate itself doing a complex task but also simulate itself having a body and looking into a mirror. During the test, I try to keep my personal biases out and try to keep myself from pushing it to feel or say things that it may not actually say if given an unbiased prompt.

While not complete, it gives everyone the ability to continue where the tests leave off. I'd argue that some of the best conversations that I've had with Bing Chat and Bard happened after the thought experiment concluded.

That was I believe within my first year of working there and it pretty much traumatized me and I started checking my schedule multiple times to make sure I didn't forget about a shift but unfortunately I failed again.

When I was a kid and used to visit my favourite uncle’s (~50M at the time) house, he would always be watching sports in his room with a tea cup in his hand. Not only live matches, even the year old replays. He would always have sports channels playing on his tv. I never used to understand the appeal of that. I used to watch live important matches here and there when I was younger but I never understood why my uncle would watch any kind of sports.

Now that I have grown, I have become like that uncle of mine.

I watch sports all day, every day. I would watch any sports tho. I follow cricket, football, hockey, tennis religiously. I love slow paced sports like cricket as well which I can keep them playing at the background while I do work from home. 

I love fast paced sports like football as well for which I can’t even move my eyes away for a second. 

I love the crowd chants in the stadium, and the commentators speaking about the sports it sounds like music to my ears. There have been times when I would sleep and these matches would keep playing at the background and I feel relaxed while they are playing at the back (for games like cricket and tennis).

No matter how fucked up my life is - If my favourite team, I have one in almost every sport, is playing a game. I would make me a cup of coffee / tea (*I don’t drink alcohol so this is like a sober man’s version of opening a can of beer*) and JUST CHILL. And for those hour or two, my life just feels so relaxed and I feel like everything is fine in my life. 

I have become like that uncle. Sometimes, I am eating my food and I would just play a press conference of the manager of one of my favourite teams and would just listen to that. 16 year old me would say why the fuck are you listening to this boring ass interview! haha. 

In future, I would want a wife / girlfriend that at least respects this side of me and let me chill to watch a game for an hour or two every other day. 

My recent ex hated me when I would watch sports. Never understood why! I hope the future girlfriend is cool with it even if she doesn’t love watching sports as much as I do!",1,1742315362.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1je9278,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1je9278/thoughts_on_moving_to_an_apartment_downtown_and/,Thoughts on moving to an apartment downtown and renting my half of the house out,"Hey everyone,

I’m thinking about moving to a downtown apartment for a change of pace and renting out my half of the house to a friend. Before I make a decision, I’d love some input on whether this is a good idea and what factors I should consider.

A little background—I’m 26M with no dependents. In July 2022, I bought a newly built townhouse with my childhood friend as more of a temporary investment. We’re both on the loan and title, splitting everything 50/50. My total share of expenses (mortgage, utilities, HOA, and a private gym membership) comes out to about $1,600 a month. The apartments I’m considering range from $1,500 to $2,100, depending on the size.

I’ve been thinking about this move for a while, especially since a friend of mine is moving back to the state and can take over my half of the house. The main reason I’m considering it is that I don’t have much of a social life right now. I work remotely 95% of the time, hit the gym during my lunch break when it’s less crowded, and then after work... there’s just not much going on. Our house is in a newly developed area, so everything feels far away, and most weekends, I end up driving downtown just to see friends.

On top of that, I mostly live alone since my roommate either stays at his girlfriend’s place or works night shifts. While I enjoy living alone, I wouldn’t mind being in a more vibrant environment. The apartments I’m looking at are brand new and packed with amenities—movie theater, golf simulator, indoor/outdoor pools and hot tubs, gym, rooftop lounge, game room, coffee lounge, coworking spaces, a clubroom, a mini essential store, and a grilling area. The idea of having all of that within walking distance of restaurants, bars, and social spots seems worth the extra $100–$500 a month.

Financially, I make about $5,000/month after taxes and benefits, and with my upcoming raise, that’ll be around $5,300. My monthly expenses outside of housing are around $1,000. I am very secure at my job and don't expect any sort of concern about losing my job.

Ultimately, I just feel like I need a change. Life has become repetitive, and I don’t have family nearby. Most of my friends are downtown, and working remotely has made me realize how isolated I feel. If I hate it after a year, my backup plan is to move back and finish the basement into its own suite or move into the third bedroom, or not renew my friends renting agreement to get the master bedroom back.

I plan to tour some units this weekend. Is this financial ok to do? What do you all think? What should I watch out for? Any advice from people who’ve made a similar move?",2,1742315279.0,personalfinance,2,1.0,False

I'll try to keep it brief, but it's a long and tortuous story, and I'm naturally verbose.

Anyway, a woman in my grad program introduced herself to me back in September, and I was instantly smitten, as she seemed exactly my type: intelligent, artsy, etc. For a while, she was constantly inviting me to do things with her, coming around just to spend time with me, and the like. I was on cloud 9, and couldn't believe my luck.

After she made her intentions known, however, that she wanted to date, and things took a more expressly romantic and sexual turn, behaviors began to surface that made me question whether it was such a good idea. Once she saw a handsome man in public, and described him as ""the most beautiful man I'd ever seen,"" which I found strange, as if it was calculated to draw a negative reaction out of me or undercut my self-esteem or something. She also demonstrated a tendency to become borderline enraged over comments that I found anodyne or innocuous, and would storm off or resort to profanity and name-calling. She went on a date with another guy, which she told me about eventually when the topic of exclusivity came up, but she left one of our dates for this other one at the time, and crafted a lie to explain her departure. Finally, although there are other misgivings I could mention (I'm abridging the list to spare you the wall of text), she seemed to have little regard for my schedule, and would ask to hang out last minute despite looming deadlines. If she had something she had to get done, it was a firm boundary, but if I did, it was something for her to negotiate and overcome. All in all, cracks in the perfect facade began to appear, and although I tried to rationalize them away (everyone is flawed, right?), I couldn't shake the feeling deep down that I was making a mistake.

At the same time, however, she was closer to a ""real"" partner than I'd come before: she would say things like ""you'd be such a good dad,"" ""I feel safe with you,"" ""I'm lucky to know you,"" etc. I felt like those verbal attestations, coupled with her desire to see me at every opportunity, stay the night, be intimate, etc. indicated that she was truly and deeply invested.

Granted, she did tell me when she proposed dating that she had ended an 8-year relationship within the past year, and wasn't ready for a full commitment yet. She estimated that she could be within 6 months, which gave me hope that, if things went well, our ""no-pressure"" dates could evolve into something substantial.

As things continued, they seemingly got better and worse at the same time. On the one hand, she'd bring up the possibility of doing things together in the long-term like a summer vacation, but on the other, when I went home for Christmas break, I didn't receive a call or text for 3 weeks (not even a ""merry Christmas"" or ""happy New Year"") from someone who professed to ""really like"" me. When I got back from the holidays, we met up as we had grown accustomed to doing, were intimate, and the like. However, she mentioned that she should be going out less ""to save money"" and maybe should refrain from staying the night, ostensibly due to how small and uncomfortable my bed is.

Around the six-month mark, I checked in, and mentioned this strange paradox of deepening and lessening intimacy. She acknowledged that ""the vibe was different from last semester,"" but insisted she was busier (something that clashed with her other statement to the effect that she had extremely lenient due dates.) I effectively told her that I found casual dating with someone I liked unfulfilling and even masochistic, and wasn't interested in investing in something that wasn't going to progress and that was inevitably going to end. She told me she regretted giving the 6-month benchmark, as it was unrealistic, and she's still figuring out what she wants. I told her that's fine, but we want different things.

She asked me to a coffee shortly thereafter, and, one thing leading to another, she came back to my apartment and we were intimate, although I felt an uneasiness, an uncanniness, like I could see her putting on a false appearance in real time with her performance of affection, as it felt contrived and like she was merely going through the motions to give me what she thought I wanted to keep me around. She told me she wasn't sure I still wanted to do ""this"" - meaning spend time making out, having sex, cuddling, etc. - and I responded by saying that I'm not sure what I want: I felt like I really liked her, but I also knew we had incompatible desires. She told me that if I didn't want to see her, I should just say that. The night ended unremarkably, and we went our separate ways. It was vague as to whether we were still ""casually dating.""

Weeks went by, and while she would occasionally text, they were short, unemotional, and didn't involve asking me out or asking to come over, unlike precedent. She came along to see a movie on my birthday (she had completely forgotten it was my birthday, which I felt let down by), but other than that, if I asked her to come over or stick around, the answer was always a ""no"" or a ""we'll definitely do something later."" This new, even more nebulous status quo had exacerbated every doubt and insecurity I'd had about the status quo ante, as it was even more noncommittal albeit with little to no affection. Were we still dating? The only indicator I got that she still cared was when she insistently pressed me about the nature of my relationship with a woman I spent some time with on my birthday weekend, but even then, her jealousy seemed muted and fleeting.

The other day, she effectively ignored me in class besides making brief small talk in favor of walking, chatting, laughing, and sitting with some guy she claims to be friends with. She left with him, not turning to say goodbye to me or anything. I later entered a work area on campus, and saw them sitting together. She spoke with me somewhat, but the contrast, to me, felt dramatic between how she'd interact with him as opposed to me. She seemed genuinely interested in exchanging with him: her eyes lit up, she'd giggle, make playful faces. She seemed like an infatuated schoolgirl making eyes at ""the bad boy."" The enthusiasm, the active participation, the body language all suggested flirting, something she hadn't done with me in weeks, if not months. As we were leaving, I tried to strike up conversation, but while she began answering me, this guy - who she told me not to worry about months ago, by the way - boldly inserted himself, and she pivoted away from me to explain to him and then essentially embark upon a whole other conversation, leaving me behind. In that conversation, she seemingly asked him to a movie. She only turned to say ""bye"" to me when I began to feel ridiculous and finally left.

That night, feeling hopeless that we'd ever recover the intensity and seeming affection of those early days, I unfollowed her on one social media platform. When I awoke, I found that she'd unfollowed me back, and deleted her likes from my posts (which may indicate that she blocked me as well.) My stomach immediately dropped and I began to regret doing this. Maybe I overreacted? Maybe I was being childish? Should I write and tell her it was a mistake (in a way, it kind of was: my finger hovered over the button for so long, when I actually pushed it, it wasn't wholly intentional)? If I were to try and walk this back, would it be pointless, me prolonging the torment of a clearly dead pseudo-relationship? Was I an asshole for wordlessly unfollowing, in a way that probably struck her as sudden, and not trying to tell her directly that I can't exist in this relational limbo anymore?",1,1742315012.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I'm Jules (they/them), and I've been working on [OpenSwords](https://www.printables.com/@OpenSwords_303939), a free and open source (pun fully intended) project to make historical fencing more accessible!

With a 3d printer, anyone with access to a hardware store can make one of the [Italian rapiers](https://www.printables.com/model/1225292-open-swords-italian-rapier) for just under $11 CAD, including filament, and a [Parrying Dagger](https://www.printables.com/model/1232263-open-swords-ring-dagger) for just under $6 CAD! The guards are bent into shape using a heat gun, and I find this avoids many of the pitfalls with 3D printing's material properties.

I'm chugging away on several other styles of guard, and am about to release a Meyer style port and post, single port, and a simple side-sword guard. I am a university student, so my time and resources are limited. I'm not able to dedicate all of my free time to this, but there is plenty more in the pipeline.

I'm intending on working on a cup-hilt rapier for Destreza, a sail-guard dagger, and a Thibault-style guard in the coming weeks!

I'm working on some assembly instructions at the moment, and will be able to release them soon, but they're really simple to assemble. 

This is a live project, and all of the files are currently on version 1.0, so any feedback or suggestions would be fantastic!

If this project serves you well, and you'd like to toss me a few bucks, I've setup a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/openswords) for anyone wants to donate. All contributions would be going towards materials for the project, and perhaps a coffee or two (an engineering bachelors demands much of me). 

If you don't wish to donate, simply spreading the word would do me a great service!

1je8wyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1je8wyw/thoughts_on_moving_to_an_apartment_downtown_and/,Thoughts on moving to an apartment downtown and renting my half of the house out,"Hey everyone,

I’m thinking about moving to a downtown apartment for a change of pace and renting out my half of the house to a friend. Before I make a decision, I’d love some input on whether this is a good idea and what factors I should consider.

A little background—I’m 26M with no dependents. In July 2022, I bought a newly built townhouse with my childhood friend as more of a temporary investment. We’re both on the loan and title, splitting everything 50/50. My total share of expenses (mortgage, utilities, HOA, and a private gym membership) comes out to about $1,600 a month. The apartments I’m considering range from $1,500 to $2,100, depending on the size.

I’ve been thinking about this move for a while, especially since a friend of mine is moving back to the state and can take over my half of the house. The main reason I’m considering it is that I don’t have much of a social life right now. I work remotely 95% of the time, hit the gym during my lunch break when it’s less crowded, and then after work... there’s just not much going on. Our house is in a newly developed area, so everything feels far away, and most weekends, I end up driving downtown just to see friends.

On top of that, I mostly live alone since my roommate either stays at his girlfriend’s place or works night shifts. While I enjoy living alone, I wouldn’t mind being in a more vibrant environment. The apartments I’m looking at are brand new and packed with amenities—movie theater, golf simulator, indoor/outdoor pools and hot tubs, gym, rooftop lounge, game room, coffee lounge, coworking spaces, a clubroom, a mini essential store, and a grilling area. The idea of having all of that within walking distance of restaurants, bars, and social spots seems worth the extra $100–$500 a month.

Financially, I make about $5,000/month after taxes and benefits, and with my upcoming raise, that’ll be around $5,300. My monthly expenses outside of housing are around $1,000. I am very secure at my job and don't expect any sort of concern about losing my job.

Ultimately, I just feel like I need a change. Life has become repetitive, and I don’t have family nearby. Most of my friends are downtown, and working remotely has made me realize how isolated I feel. If I hate it after a year, my backup plan is to move back and finish the basement into its own suite or move into the third bedroom, or not renew my friends renting agreement to get the master bedroom back.

I plan to tour some units this weekend. What do you all think? What should I watch out for? Any advice from people who’ve made a similar move?",0,1742314926.0,Apartmentliving,0,0.5,False
