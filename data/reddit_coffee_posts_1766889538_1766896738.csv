# (Spiritual, Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Financial — parody breakdown)

# 🕊️ SPIRITUAL

* You discover spirituality does not run on autopay.
* Silence works without donations.
* Meaning stops needing proof-of-payment.
* Faith (if you keep it) becomes private again — terrifyingly effective.
* You realize conviction doesn’t send reminders.

**Parody takeaway:**  
If the sacred needs billing, it might be customer service.

# 💪 PHYSICAL

* Shoulders drop.
* Jaw unclenches.
* Sleep improves (no “did I forget something?” cortisol spike).
* Coffee tastes better when it’s not a moral compromise.
* Your body stops bracing for invisible consequences.

**Parody takeaway:**  
Your nervous system prefers choice over obligation.

# ❤️ EMOTIONAL

* Guilt loses its job.
* Relief shows up quietly.
* Self-trust increases.
* You stop rehearsing apologies no one asked for.
* You feel generosity again — not pressure.

**Parody takeaway:**  
Real kindness doesn’t threaten you when you pause it.

# 🧠 MENTAL

* Fewer justifications.
* Less magical accounting.
* No retroactive meaning assignment.
* Clearer thinking without “cause and effect” gymnastics.
* You reclaim mental bandwidth previously leased out monthly.

**Parody takeaway:**  
Clarity improves when fear-based math is removed.

# 💰 FINANCIAL

* Money stays where you put it.
* Emergencies feel less dramatic.
* Choice replaces obligation.
* Giving becomes intentional instead of ritual.
* You remember: *it was always your money.*

**Parody takeaway:**  
Your wallet doesn’t need enlightenment — it needs honesty.

# ☢️ FINAL PARODY VERDICT

Saying no to Zaimu does **not**:

* Break your spirit
* Curse your body
* Corrupt your mind
* Collapse your finances

It does one disruptive thing instead:

The owner confronts us to tell us off for doing crafts inside and that this isn’t a craft fair, to go to the library instead (i had bought a coffee in advance), and that it’s inappropriate to do crafts where people would be eating. I was confused because it’s not as though crocheting is inherently messy and that we wouldn’t clean up after ourselves? Either way I don’t understand how this would’ve been a hazard for future coffee shop clients eating after us (at the time there were only 2 other patrons). When we tried to explain that diamond painting wasn’t real painting (she was concerned about “fumes”) and why it wasn’t an issue, she called us “rude young ladies”. No other patron or staff member talked to us before hand so idk if she was just offended that we pushed back on her or she just didn’t like us.

TLDR: is it inappropriate to crochet in a coffee shop? if it is, where are public places where you can craft and chill? Thanks!",2,1766896576.0,crochet,0,1.0,False

Her name is Payal and we matched on a dating app called Happn. There were a lot of suspicious things and red flags that I want you guys out there to be careful of:
1. We started talking and the day we matched, she wanted to meet for drinks. I postponed it since I had other plans and planned to meet some other day. 
2. The day I planned to meet with her, I tried to change locations and call her at a coffee shop because a coffee date would be max 20-30 mins which is good enough for a first date. But she said she was lactose intolerant.
3. She also did not want to meet at a pre-planned place because she had ""trust issues"". 
4. When we met, she took me to Wasabi Lounge, which I heard is a popular place where girls take guys to scam them. She ordered a lot of drinks and shots and I didn't have much. Our bill was about 10,000, which the server specifically came and mentioned when I asked for a menu.

1pxhzo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/1pxhzo3/bible_verse_commentary_isaiah_4522_what_does_it/,"Bible verse commentary: Isaiah 45:22  - What does it mean to be ""saved"" in the Bible?","Well, *two things:*

\- First:

* **save.** <definition> 1. *to set apart for future use* \[Source: Oxford dictionary. Web.\] “Saved” then, would be something that is set apart for future use by someone with the power and authority to “have and keep it” whatever it is, would be this. And,

\- Second:

* God said: *“Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth: For I am God, there is none else.”* \- God. (Bible. Isaiah 45:22)
   * So, it would be God:
   * Who with the power and authority to do the “save” part, because he decrees he does it to whosoever, when he tells everybody over the whole earth, doesn’t leave anybody out, to the very ends of it - *to just look unto him*. *BOOM!* He decrees it ‘saved.’ or “Set apart for future use” and that’s defined as eternity. What he wants is you to be with him forever; without end. Everybody.
* But not everybody looks unto him.
* So, part of this “Second” then is, not to look at “saved” because, it just means what the dictionary says it is; and, God does the saving himself by his power and authority.
   * **It’s really then for people:**
      * *To have a grasp of what “look unto” means*

**Maybe that’s easier to tell you what it IS NOT:**

* Then, arrive at what that IS.
   * I can tell you for certainty. I DO NOT 1) “look unto” any romantic date with a gorilla. 580lbs of solid muscle with the tensile strength a gorilla can bench press 1800lbs and has the strength of 18 male adult people.
      * There is NOTHING romantic at all, in “looking unto” to “walk after,” to “walk in” following after anything at all that would lead me down any road, that led to me to go on a date with a gorilla. Not happening. I actually AVOID it. So, I DO NOT ‘look unto” this.
      * Nowhere on the radar screen to look at or do it.
* Poor example, but the best I could come up with off the top of my head.
* So, with that, as what this “it” of “look unto” IS NOT:
   * For ME:
      * What this “look unto” is, IS:
   * I DO look unto: Any opportunity that even remotely includes going to the Shopping Mall in my town. I love it.
      * I really don’t shop. I just go there for the coffee. It has two coffee shops. If I’m alone, I choose one consistently over the other; but if with my wife, my wife likes the other, so we go together to that one, and either one for me - I can tell you plain as day:
      * IF: The day, no matter what day it is, includes any mention of anybody going to the mall, I WILL - walk after, to walk in, that means I deliberately *“set my mind on”* whatever it takes to drive myself, or take the trolley, or even walk 2 hours it takes to get to the Mall, and go have coffee.
      * So any “disturbance” or some “temptation” something to tempt me to do otherwise, like the lawn needs mowed or the neighbor has a flat tire - yeah. I should fix those FIRST; but I DON’T. I don’t let anything get in the way of me walking in, no matter what I’m doing, even if it’s a “delay” - I’m STILL going to be at the Mall, drinking coffee.
* Why? I look unto it.
   * No matter the reason - it’s a PROFIT. Means it equips me. After, I feel better.

**And already God has decreed this; that:**

* *“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”* \- Jesus Christ. The Word of God. (Bible. Matthew 4:4)
   * So me: Living by the word of some college professor with three Ph.d’s and a Fellow in two of them vs. what the Bible says in Proverbs 2:6
      * “*For the Lord giveth wisdom*: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.”
   * I have a choice. I can “set my mind on” the imaginations of people. What they “thinky” up and claim what they say is true and I can accept it as true. Then, I’m already fat, dumb, and happy.
* Like tell me, driving my car: Big sign advertisement says: “stop by the gas station here! Fill up!” When I already filled the tank up .2 or 200 meters before - and I simply don’t need it.
* **When this is the Word of God - that God, who made all there is out my window decreed:**
   * What I never understood before, looking out the window and wondered “How do I ‘fit’ in? and never fit in anyplace.
      * That I am to live by every word proceeds out of his mouth.
* To just walk after, to walk in, looking unto everything he says.

**So, I’m not going to answer your question.** Based on this, you tell me the answer.

But I know without any doubt, the answer is just look unto him. There is none else.",1,1766895604.0,BibleVerseCommentary,0,1.0,False

I want to add 5 string PJ bass to my collection as new years present for me .

my budget is  $/€750 -1500 ( can cough up another 100-200) . 

I’m only looking for 5 string ones , PJ or split coil( switch between single /humb ), not  a budget model and preferable brand new .

There are  almost  zero to none   PJs in my area , so it’s hard to go and test em out ☹️.

i have a short list of models caught my attention :

  
1 **Yamaha BB735**  i like  look and dark coffee finish , also tried less premium models 200 4 strings and 400 5 strings and liked it 

2 **Sadowsky metro express**  , tried one 5-6 years ago and was pleased . Only drawback for me is  too vintage looking  design 

3 **Lakland Skyline 55-02** not a classic PJ and little bit over my  budget 

4 **Schecter Model T5 Exotic**  really like how it looks 

**5 Ibanez Sr755 used ,** I’m a little bit tired of  Ibanez basses , really want something different but Ibanez is safe bet for me .Ibanez is one of my all time favorite manufacturer .



6 **Sire P8** i tried P5 model can’t really tell much about it

Pro features remain paid, but it is voluntary and anyone can always fork a free version from the source code. If you do wish to to buy me a coffee that would be appreciated!

1pxhtij,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxhtij,Billionaire Alpha's 99 Deadly Games,"When Aria Collins rushed to the healer den after hearing that her mate Alpha Lucas Thornwood had been attacked by rival wolves and was bleeding out, she immediately donated a full liter of blood for him.


His friends urged her to go home and rest, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back.


Turning around, she witnessed the pack healer dumping all five bags of blood—her blood—straight into the garbage bin!


At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows.


""Your Sweet Luna, Aria Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!""


Aria froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him.


Lucas was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features—


He didn't have a single scratch on him!


Aria blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate.


""Guys, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Lucas's closed friend. ""How many times have we screwed with her now?""


""The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another alpha's son from Lucas's circle, ""we told her Lucas lost the silver moon pendant he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit.""


""Remember the second time?"" Derek, Lucas's another friend, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Lucas was in a coma after a territory fight. She spent all night at the sacred grove lighting candles and sobbing to the pack elders. Got blessed water and a moonstone. Lucas poured the water out casually and gifted the moonstone to Leila Blackwood the next day!""


""My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for challenging the lycan king's mate and nearly got her a rogue. The way she begged the pack council—pathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""


""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Lucas?""


Lucas barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally reject her and banish her from the pack after we hit ninety-nine.""


""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that position as ceremonial dancer? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your beloved and gets away with it.""


""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Pretending to accept her as your future Luna just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""


A deafening ringing filled Aria's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.


Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.


The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Lucas was only mating with her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love—just an elaborate scheme to break her.


He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...


Lucas Thornwood, the Alpha of The Thornwood Pack. With his predatory good looks, he could've stepped off a GQ billboard. ""One look at Lucas Thornwood and you're ruined for all other wolves""—that's what everyone said.


And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.


Since the day she found out he was her mate, she had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent—until one day, when he miraculously accepted her as his mate.


She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.


The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.


He only agreed to accept her later because she had beaten Leila Blackwood in that crucial moon dance competition and made his precious beloved cry.


For revenge, he pretended to accept her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.


Aria's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.


She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Lucas's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.


She had given him everything—her love, her trust, her very being—only for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.


Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.


Aria spun around and fled.


She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the pack compound corridors, past startled pack members and guards.


She had no destination—she just needed to escape this place, escape Lucas, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.


When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the pack garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.


She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.


God, Aria, you pathetic, gullible fool.


After what seemed like hours, her mother's gentle voice reached her through the mindlink.


""Aria, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to the Northern Alpine Pack in the Northern Territory next week. The High Alpha Council has requested him to lead their howl choir before the next full moon ceremony. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They has excellent moonlight dance instructors too.""


Her father, a celebrated historian of werewolf traditions, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Aria had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Lucas. She'd even considered staying with The Thornwood Pack permanently, transferring her allegiance just to be near him.


Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any silver blade could.


""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to the Northern Alpine Pack.""


Chapter 2


Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the mindlink: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the pack transfer ritual right away—once it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""


Her fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""


Her mother was about to end the mind-link but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that alpha mate of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""


The word ""mate"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.


Aria's mind instantly flashed back to the healer's room—the cruel laughter, Lucas sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years pretending to accept her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Blackwood.


Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.


""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""


After the mind-link, Aria stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""


The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.


Aria froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.


This was Lucas's den—the one he'd casually invited her to share after accepting her.


That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna move in?""


Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their bond rather than what it actually was—convenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.


She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future mating ceremony, picturing their cubs running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.


Now those memories were like wolfsbane in her veins.


Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.


She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila—to waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to let her sleep in his den, to run with her during full moons night after night...


All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.


For the next three days, Aria didn't contact Lucas.


She locked herself in the den and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.


She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush—a thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.


""OMG saw Lucas in the pack borders today!!! Charcoal V-neck + those black jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to patrol because I couldn't stop staring!""


""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""


""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Lucas Thornwood is letting ME into his pack. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""


Aria flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.


She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger—at him, but mostly at herself.


Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on—


The silver wolf pendant she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition ceremonial knife she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The leather jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.


Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.


Pictures of Lucas giving speeches at pack gatherings, dominating the training grounds, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers—each one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.


She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.


By the evening of the third day, Aria had finally purged the last item.


Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.


Just then, the front door swung open and Lucas walked in.


His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.


Aria looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""


Lucas stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was at the pack healer's after a serious territory dispute. Where were you?""


Aria's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""


Lucas froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""


His gaze dropped to her arm, his voice dropping to that seductive murmur she once found irresistible: ""Are you in pain?""


Aria pulled her arm away like his gaze might contaminate her. ""No,"" she said flatly, as if speaking to a stranger.


Lucas's brow furrowed deeply, clearly unsettled by this new version of her: ""What the fuck happened while I was gone? You're like a completely different person.""


Aria's lips twitched into a smile that didn't reach her eyes: ""Different? How so?""


Lucas didn't answer, but they both knew exactly what had changed.


The old Aria had looked at him like he hung the moon and stars. She'd once spent three straight nights by his bedside when he had a common cold, checking his temperature every hour, making homemade soup, practically worshipping at the altar of his minor discomfort.


Yet now, after what was supposed to be a life-threatening injury, she hadn't even bothered to call.


Lucas's intense gaze searched her face, hunting for some clue to this sudden transformation.


His voice dropped to that practiced, intimate tone he used when he wanted something: ""You seem stressed. My friends are throwing me a welcome-back rager tonight. Come with me?""


Chapter 3


Before Aria could refuse, Lucas had already grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her to his Range Rover.


The car pulled up outside The Night, the territory's most exclusive alphas-only club for elite werewolves. After parking, Lucas circled around to her side and opened the door with a theatrical flourish that once would have made her heart flutter.


Aria gave him a flat, empty stare as she stepped out.


The moment they entered the dimly lit space, Aria's attention was immediately drawn to a familiar figure.


Leila Blackwood.


She wore a champagne silk slip dress with a dangerously high slit, designer heels, and just enough silver to look effortless. Her glossy hair fell in loose waves, and her calculated smile drew everyone in as she held court in the VIP section, cocktail in hand.


Leila had been Lucas's childhood friend. During the years Aria had mated with Lucas, the two women had never crossed paths.


So she'd never suspected that Lucas had been obsessed with Leila all along.


When Leila spotted them, her eyes flickered with recognition, then narrowed into the slightest smirk—a look that confirmed everything. She'd been in on the 99-part revenge scheme all along.


This is revenge #97, Aria realized with stomach-turning clarity. Coming here was a setup.


Lucas also noticed Leila's presence. His fingers tensed around Aria's before he abruptly dropped her hand like it had burned him.


He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear: ""Gotta take this call. Network with packmates or whatever. Back in five.""


Aria stood frozen, watching Lucas's retreating figure, a cold emptiness spreading through her chest. The casualness of his dismissal felt like another slap in the face.


Before she could react, Leila was already gliding across the room with runway precision, following directly in Lucas's wake.


Their silhouettes—one leading, one following—disappeared around a corner, no doubt heading somewhere private.


Aria had no time to dwell on what they might be doing together, as Lucas's friends quickly surrounded her.


""Well, if it isn't Lucas's favorite charity case!"" Tyler's voice boomed as he shoved a glass of something amber-colored into her hand.


Aria shook her head firmly. ""I don't drink.""


""Don't be such a fucking buzzkill,"" Blake sneered. ""What's wrong, afraid Lucas will get mad?"" They all laughed, exchanging knowing glances.


""Or maybe she can't handle her liquor,"" Derek added, pushing the glass toward her lips. ""Little Miss Perfect probably gets wasted off one shot.""


Aria tried to step back, but Josh blocked her path. ""Either drink it or wear it, sweetheart.""


When she tried to break free, Tyler gave her a hard shove. ""Oops, my bad.""


""Ah—!""


She cried out as she lost her balance and fell straight into the adjacent infinity pool.


The freezing water engulfed her instantly.


She couldn't swim. Her limbs flailed desperately, but her clothes quickly became waterlogged, dragging her down.


Water rushed into her nose and mouth, burning her lungs. The club lights above the surface blurred and distorted as her consciousness began to fade, darkness closing in until everything went black.


...


When Aria next opened her eyes, she found herself back in the bedroom of Lucas's den. Her head pounded with each heartbeat, and her body burned as if she were being roasted alive.


She struggled to focus her vision and saw Lucas sitting by the bed, holding a glass of water and some pills.


""You're burning up. Take these,"" Lucas said, his voice soft with what might have seemed like concern—if she didn't know better now.


Aria hazily accepted the pills and swallowed them with the water.


Too weak to think clearly, she only registered that her throat felt like she'd swallowed glass and her body seemed to have turned to concrete.


She closed her eyes, wanting to escape back into unconsciousness, but her temperature kept climbing, something scorching through her veins.


Some time later—minutes or hours, she couldn't tell—she forced her eyes open again and realized Lucas was gone.


Of course, she thought bitterly. He can't even be bothered to maintain the charade anymore.


She struggled to sit up, touching her forehead. It was terrifyingly hot.


She knew she couldn't wait any longer. She needed medical help.


With trembling fingers, she ordered an Uber to the nearest ER out of the pack.


Aria dragged her leaden body through the hospital doors, barely making it to the reception desk before a nurse rushed to help her.


The doctor immediately put her on an IV drip, which finally brought her fever down slightly.


After examining her thoroughly, the doctor frowned: ""Ms. Collins, your temperature was 104.3 when you came in. You're bordering on pneumonia from aspiration. Why didn't you come in sooner?""


Aria leaned weakly against the hospital bed, her voice barely audible: ""I thought the medicine would help.""


The doctor looked concerned. ""What medicine were you taking?""


Aria pulled a small bottle from her pocket and handed it to the doctor. ""Fever reducers. My mate gave it to me.""


The doctor opened the bottle, examined its contents, and his expression darkened: ""These aren't medication at all. The bottle is labeled correctly, but these are nothing but sugar pills. Taking these instead of actual medication could have been extremely dangerous in your condition.""


Aria's heart plummeted, her fingers trembling slightly.


Suddenly, her phone buzzed repeatedly.


She weakly raised her hand to check it. A series of WhatsApp notifications lit up her screen.


They were from a group chat with Lucas's friends.


Tyler: Revenge #97 = EPIC WIN!!!


Blake: Whoever came up with the pool + fake meds combo deserves a fucking medal! First we ""accidentally"" push her in, then Lucas swoops in with sugar pills. She's gotta be DYING rn


Josh: Lucas's face when she swallowed those pills tho


Derek: HOLY SHIT DELETE THIS! WRONG GROUP! SHE CAN SEE THESE!!!

1pxhqwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScriptureLife/comments/1pxhqwb/scripture_life_what_does_it_mean_to_be_saved_in/,"Scripture Life: What does it mean to be ""saved"" in the Bible?","Well, *two things:*

\- First:

* **save.** <definition> 1. *to set apart for future use* \[Source: Oxford dictionary. Web.\] “Saved” then, would be something that is set apart for future use by someone with the power and authority to “have and keep it” whatever it is, would be this. And,

\- Second:

   * God said: *“Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth: For I am God, there is none else.”* \- God. (Bible. Isaiah 45:22)
      * So, it would be God:
      * Who with the power and authority to do the “save” part, because he decrees he does it to whosoever, when he tells everybody over the whole earth, doesn’t leave anybody out, to the very ends of it - *to just look unto him*. *BOOM!* He decrees it ‘saved.’ or “Set apart for future use” and that’s defined as eternity. What he wants is you to be with him forever; without end. Everybody.
   * But not everybody looks unto him.
* So, part of this “Second” then is, not to look at “saved” because, it just means what the dictionary says it is; and, God does the saving himself by his power and authority.
   * **It’s really then for people:**
      * *To have a grasp of what “look unto” means*

**Maybe that’s easier to tell you what it IS NOT:**

* Then, arrive at what that IS.
   * I can tell you for certainty. I DO NOT 1) “look unto” any romantic date with a gorilla. 580lbs of solid muscle with the tensile strength a gorilla can bench press 1800lbs and has the strength of 18 male adult people.
      * There is NOTHING romantic at all, in “looking unto” to “walk after,” to “walk in” following after anything at all that would lead me down any road, that led to me to go on a date with a gorilla. Not happening. I actually AVOID it. So, I DO NOT ‘look unto” this.
      * Nowhere on the radar screen to look at or do it.
* Poor example, but the best I could come up with off the top of my head.
* So, with that, as what this “it” of “look unto” IS NOT:
   * For ME:
      * What this “look unto” is, IS:
   * I DO look unto: Any opportunity that even remotely includes going to the Shopping Mall in my town. I love it.
      * I really don’t shop. I just go there for the coffee. It has two coffee shops. If I’m alone, I choose one consistently over the other; but if with my wife, my wife likes the other, so we go together to that one, and either one for me - I can tell you plain as day:
      * IF: The day, no matter what day it is, includes any mention of anybody going to the mall, I WILL - walk after, to walk in, that means I deliberately *“set my mind on”* whatever it takes to drive myself, or take the trolley, or even walk 2 hours it takes to get to the Mall, and go have coffee.
      * So any “disturbance” or some “temptation” something to tempt me to do otherwise, like the lawn needs mowed or the neighbor has a flat tire - yeah. I should fix those FIRST; but I DON’T. I don’t let anything get in the way of me walking in, no matter what I’m doing, even if it’s a “delay” - I’m STILL going to be at the Mall, drinking coffee.
* Why? I look unto it.
   * No matter the reason - it’s a PROFIT. Means it equips me. After, I feel better.

**And already God has decreed this; that:**

* *“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”* \- Jesus Christ. The Word of God. (Bible. Matthew 4:4)
   * So me: Living by the word of some college professor with three Ph.d’s and a Fellow in two of them vs. what the Bible says in Proverbs 2:6
      * “*For the Lord giveth wisdom*: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.”
   * I have a choice. I can “set my mind on” the imaginations of people. WHat they “thinky” up and claim what they say is true and I can accept it as true. Then, I’m already fat, dumb, and happy.
* Like tell me, driving my car: Big sign advertisement says: “stop by the gas station here! Fill up!” When I already filled the tank up .2 or 200 meters before - and I simply don’t need it.
* **When this is the Word of God - that God, who made all there is out my window decreed:**
   * What I never understood before, looking out the window and wondered “How do I ‘fit’ in? and never fit in anyplace.
      * That I am to live by every word proceeds out of his mouth.
* To just walk after, to walk in, looking unto everything he says.

**So, I’m not going to answer your question.** Based on this, you tell me the answer.

But I know without any doubt, the answer is just look unto him. There is none else.",1,1766894869.0,ScriptureLife,0,1.0,False

She was in failing health for some time. The last week of her life it just got worse. We couldn’t let her suffer. We had to let her go as much as we didn’t want to. My brain tells me we made the right decision, my heart tells screams out “what if…..”

I miss her terribly. It is so quiet in the house, even though we have a 9 year child. She wasn’t a particularly noisy dog by any means. But I miss the tip tap of her nails on the floor, the soft snoring while she was sleeping, the barking when the doorbell rang or when she was begging for food. I miss all our little routines. Like everyday at 5pm was dinner time. Then after dinner she would sit there and wait for me to give her supplements wrapped in turkey and then finish off the meal with a treat. I work from home, I miss walking downstairs to get a cup of coffee or whatever and stopping to pet her, or put her outside. I really hate leaving my house and coming back home to the quiet emptiness. I don’t have to worry about rushing home to let her out or feed her. No one greets me at the door. Every day at 5pm I still think “I have to feed the dog”. When I leave the house I always say out loud I miss you, you were such a good girl, I love you. But, I there are no treats to toss to someone as I’m heading out the door. In time I’ll get used to my new routines and the quietness. But right now the quiet is deafening.

We’re in the process of a final inspection on a home. Instead of a double wall over, there was a water connection (almost like a toilet water pipe) jutting out of the wall where an oven would go. The intention of this water was for a built in coffee machine the seller never installed. 

I asked for the pipe to be capped as close to flush with the wall so I can install a double wall oven. Instead, the sellers complete cut the water pipe out and put sheet rock over it. They informed me there is a shut off valve in the adjacent cabinet. 

My question is; is this code in Texas (DFW) or even good practice? What if any problems should I look for? There’s a ton of trust issues here, so I’m not trying to find a problem, just want a proper, code compliant fix.

Our last sold-out night (until tonight) was in October. 

The Holidays started off pretty well, people were in a good mood and pleasant. I worked Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and I will be working on New Years Eve and the New Year. It's fine, car repairs maxed out my credit card and I need money to pay them off.

But then, after this smooth start of the Holidays, then... Tonight .. Sold-out. 

It was non stop luggage rolling, phone ringing, people passing by constantly, and once they have checked-in, they come back again and again. I did not have a single minute to myself. When I tried to eat my dinner, I would take a bite and someone would pop up. When I would go to the bathroom, of course somebody would be waiting at the desk when I came back. 

So many guests made a reservation for two people but they had in fact two or three or even four extra guests in one case. 

The rate changes with the number of guests. Some were here for five or six nights. 10$/night/kid, 20$/night/extra adult. For one of these guests, the bill increased by 300$ ...... 

Management asks us to be very strict about this. People, just make your reservation correctly. Whatever the website, the first two questions you are asked when you booked are: 1-the dates 2-the number of guests. The second question is not a decoration. For some hotels, it won't affect the rate, but at several other places, it will! 

Anyways, up to the main subject of this tale. 

Right from the start, this lady from a generation where female names starting in K are popular started nagging me. 

She complained that a cloth hanger was missing in the room and she didn't want to be charged for it. She wanted to be sure I would write that in her file. I'm not even sure there is a fix amount of cloth hangers in each room... 

She rented a room with a Kitchenette. These are 10$ more a night than our regular rooms. They got two little stovetops and very basic equipment to cook and eat. 

She kept coming back and back and back asking for cups and glasses and bowls. 

A little bit past 10, she came again requesting soup spoons, tea spoons, small plates and bigger forks than the ones in the room. 

We don't have tea spoons. Pikachu face. I went to the breakfast room and got her our only format of plates and forks and spoons. 

After the upsetting news of the absence of tea spoons, she didn't like the size of the plates. She wanted smaller plates. I offered her the little plates we put under coffee cups. They were too small. ""How is this possible? How come you don't have smaller plates?"" 

And then, we she saw the size of the forks. ""OH MY GOD!! That's all you have ? But these are too small! How is this possible? What you provide, it's really not good"" 

I don't know. They seem like normal forks to me. But I don't think I ever paid attention to the size of a fork. 

But lady, if you want the full very complete fancy equipment if a full kitchen, rent a luxury cottage... 

In the infinite list of complaints guests can imagine, this one was a first. ",17,1766894024.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,4,1.0,False

I went out today to visit a dealer about an hour away from me since in one of my casual morning coffee Porsche hunts I found this 2015 911 Carrera S manual transmission for sale with 50k miles for $84.5k. Apparently a recent price drop as well at this local dealer. 

Went out to see it, drive it, and well I fell in love. While there I was also testing driving a Corvette Z06, but as expected this Porsche stole my heart. 

As I came back from the test drive, the sales manager came out to tell the sales guy and myself that the car just sold online… then tried to push me onto the z06 and saying that as a young guy, a domestic car is likely better since it also had half the mileage and whatnot, maintenance + part less expensive and that they prefer not selling the Porsche locally as if issues arises I would probably be coming in to complain. 

Either a super weird tactic, or something was off about the Porsche. They did mention the aftermarket steering wheel and spoiler, but I doubt that would affect price that much. Anyways, if it really sold, I am just Fomo’ing, but curious if I let a good one get away by not insisting to purchase on the spot over whoever got it online. ",8,1766893937.0,porsche911,26,0.9,False

Salt House

 

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged.  

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

 

Thursday, May 5^(th)   2002.

 

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements.  

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1766893631.0,u_VnhedoniV,1,1.0,False

Salt House

 

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged.  

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements.  

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1766893565.0,spooky_stories,1,1.0,False

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged.  

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements.  

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1766893452.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

Salt House

 

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged.  

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements.  

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",2,1766893388.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

1pxh1wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1pxh1wv/how_to_be_a_better_girlfriend_brutal_truths_that/,How to be a better girlfriend: brutal truths that will make or break your relationship,"Everyone talks about how to *get* into a relationship. No one really talks about how to be *good* in one. Most of the advice floating around on TikTok or Instagram is just performative fluff: “Be his peace,” “Cook for him,” “Don’t complain too much.” Like, ok?? But what if being a “better” girlfriend has nothing to do with any of that?

A lot of people, especially in their 20s, are realizing that relationships unravel not because of cheating or huge fights, but because of a thousand tiny emotional misfires. It’s not usually villainy, it’s skill gaps. And the good news? Relationship skills can be learned. This post is packed with insights from legit sources, books, real research, and psychology podcasts. No IG therapy quotes, no “divine feminine energy” cringe-talk.

Here are hard skills that actually make someone amazing to be in a relationship with:

* **_Stop “supporting,” start co-regulating_**  
  Forget “being supportive.” It’s vague. What actually builds connection is emotional co-regulation, which is your ability to stay steady *with* your partner when they’re upset.  
  * *Psychologist Dr. Becky Kennedy* breaks this down beautifully on her podcast. Your nervous system affects theirs. If they’re spiraling and you get anxious or dismissive, it escalates. But if you stay grounded and present, their brain mirrors that.  
  * The Gottman Institute’s research shows that couples who manage conflict well actually turn toward each other emotionally *during* hard moments. That means being calm isn't passive. It's contagious.  

* **_Don’t be “chill,” be honest_**  
  The “cool girl” trope is dead. Over-accommodating out of fear of being “too much” just builds resentment.  
  * From *Terri Cole’s book “Boundary Boss,”* constantly minimizing your wants is not generosity. It’s self-abandonment. Real intimacy depends on clarity, not guessing games.  
  * Be upfront when something bothers you. But don’t dump it like a hot potato. Use the “self-focused” script: “I feel X when Y happens, because Z.” Not “You always do this.”  

* **_Learn your real attachment pattern (then manage it)_**  
  This is the relationship cheat code. Most of us think we have “baggage” or are just “weirdly emotional” but actually, we have stored nervous system patterns from childhood that play out in relationships.  
  * *Attached* by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller is a game-changer. It breaks down anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles. You realize, “Ohhh this is why I freak out when he doesn’t text back for 5 hours.”  
  * Knowing yours helps you soothe it *yourself*, instead of blaming your partner. That’s emotional maturity 101.

* **_You’re not his therapist, but you do shape his growth_**  
  No, you can’t “fix him.” But you do influence him. A lot.  
  * According to a 2022 study published in *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, partner responsiveness, how well partners respond to each other’s needs, has a long-term effect on emotional development.  
  * That means how you listen, validate, or respond during his messy moments might shift how vulnerable he’s willing to be, not just with you, but with himself.  

* **_Upgrade your “arguing” software_**  
  Fights are inevitable, but *how* you argue predicts if your relationship lasts. Cold fact: eye-rolls and passive-aggression are stronger predictors of a breakup than actual disagreements.  
  * The *Gottman Institute's “Four Horsemen”* model says contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling destroy relationships faster than cheating.  
  * Replace criticism with a “soft start” (“I noticed” instead of “you never”), and always repair after conflict. That’s what resets connection. Not who “wins” the argument.

* **_Be interesting to yourself_**  
  No one wants to be someone’s entire emotional ecosystem. You being obsessed with your own growth, hobbies, or learning journey is hot.  
  * Esther Perel, therapist and author, says “desire needs space.” Want to be magnetic in your relationship? Maintain a life outside of it.  
  * Read more. Try stuff alone. Follow your curiosity. You don’t need to become a mystery. You need to stay multidimensional.  

* **_Understand partner’s “love currency,” not just yours_**  
  Everyone talks about the 5 Love Languages like it’s old news, but many girlfriends forget the *real* point: your partner doesn’t think like you.  
  * *Dr. Gary Chapman*, author of the Love Languages, emphasizes the importance of adapting, not just expressing. You might love deep convos, they might just want a hug after work. Learn to speak *their* language fluently. That’s emotional fluency.

* **_Practice “micro-kindness” instead_**  
  Romantic grand gestures are rare. What actually makes people feel loved are micro-moments: remembering something small, checking in before a stressful day, or making coffee without a word.  
  * A study from Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program in collaboration with Gallup shows small daily acts of kindness had a larger impact on relationship satisfaction than big events.  

There’s zero shame if you didn’t know any of this. Most people never got taught how to actually do partnership well. Relationships are a skill, not a vibe. And being a “better girlfriend” isn’t about being easy or agreeable, it’s about being emotionally fluent, self-aware, and co-regulated.

If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

*(c. 1800–1900)*

# Overview

In the 19th-century American West, **mind-altering substances were widely used, largely legal, and culturally normalized**. There was **no federal drug prohibition** and little medical understanding of addiction as a disease in the modern sense. Substances that are tightly regulated today were commonly sold in **general stores, saloons, pharmacies, and by mail order**.

Temperance movements existed—originating in the East and spreading westward—but **criminalization and federal enforcement did not meaningfully begin until the early 20th century**.

# Major Substances in Use

# 1. Alcohol

* **Ubiquitous and socially central**
* Consumed daily by many adults; no legal drinking age
* Safer than much available water
* Saloon culture central to frontier towns
* Heavy use widely tolerated, though moralized by temperance advocates

**Alcohol was the dominant drug of choice across class, region, and occupation.**

# 2. Tobacco

* **Everywhere, all the time**
* Hand-rolled cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco
* Used by men, women, and even children
* Rarely stigmatized

# 3. Laudanum (Opium in Alcohol)

**One of the most important—and misunderstood—substances of the era**

* A tincture of **opium dissolved in alcohol**
* Legal, unregulated, and widely marketed
* Sold by:
   * Pharmacies
   * General stores
   * Traveling salesmen
* Common brand names included *Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup* and *Godfrey’s Cordial*

**Uses:**

* Pain relief
* Diarrhea and “bowel complaints”
* Menstrual pain
* Coughs and insomnia
* Infant teething (often with tragic consequences)

**Who used it:**

* Especially common among **women**, including middle-class and respectable households
* Often prescribed or recommended by doctors
* Considered “medicine,” not a vice

**Addiction awareness:**

* Dependence was recognized (called “the opium habit”)
* Withdrawal symptoms were observed, though poorly understood
* Treatment options included rest cures, sanitariums, or gradual tapering

**Important note:**  
Laudanum addiction was **far more prevalent than commonly acknowledged**, particularly because it was socially invisible and medicalized.

# 4. Opium (Non-Medicinal Use)

* Highly **culture- and region-specific**
* Most strongly associated with **Chinese immigrant communities**
* Opium dens existed primarily in:
   * Chinatowns
   * Mining towns with large Chinese populations
* Recreational opium use among white Americans was **far less common** than later moral panics suggested

# 5. Hallucinogens

* Used **primarily in Indigenous ceremonial contexts**
* Peyote and other entheogens were:
   * Sacred
   * Ritualized
   * Not recreational
* Some westward settlers encountered these substances through **cultural exchange**, but widespread non-Native use was rare

**This is why depictions like the “scientific” experimentation in** ***Young Guns*** **stand out as anachronistic or exaggerated.**

# 6. Cannabis (Marijuana)

* Present but **not widespread**
* Most common among:
   * Mexican populations
   * Some African American communities
* Rarely mentioned in mainstream Anglo-American records
* Not criminalized or strongly stigmatized in the 19th century

# 7. Cocaine

* Legal and medically used by the late 19th century
* Found in:
   * Tonics
   * Toothache drops
   * Early medicinal preparations
* Not yet associated with criminality or racialized panic

# 8. Ether

* Used medically as an anesthetic
* Occasionally abused for intoxication
* Depicted accurately (though rarely) in media such as *Open Range*
* Still legal and purchasable by the 1880s

# 9. Caffeine (Coffee and Tea)

* **Universal daily stimulant**
* Coffee especially central to frontier life
* Sugar was expensive and scarce until beet sugar production expanded later in the century
* Numerous films (*Dances with Wolves*, *Open Range*) correctly depict coffee scenes emphasizing its importance

# Legal and Cultural Context

* **No federal drug prohibition until the early 1900s**
* Local “dry” laws existed (often religious or political), but:
   * Enforcement was inconsistent
   * Economic incentives discouraged strict regulation
* Substances were not criminalized in a blanket or systematic way

# Understanding Addiction Then vs. Now

* Addiction was **recognized**, but not scientifically defined
* Terms like “habit,” “intemperance,” or “moral weakness” were used
* Treatments included:
   * Sanitariums
   * Religious reform
   * Rest cures
* Modern neuroscience and evidence-based treatments did not exist

**That said:**  
It was as obvious in 1800 or 1900 as it is today when someone was severely abusing substances.",8,1766892647.0,Westerns,10,0.9,False

1pxgwku,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/1pxgwku/was_coffee_available_on_prebiotic_earth/,Was Coffee available on pre-biotic earth ?,"I asked AI to generate a plausible pre-biotic scenario for formation of coffee. Here it goes :

  
The chemical signature of coffee—specifically its primary bioactive components like **caffeine** and **chlorogenic acids**—can be synthesized through plausible prebiotic pathways relevant to early Earth conditions.

In the context of 2025 research into prebiotic chemistry and origins of life, a theoretical pathway for ""prebiotic coffee"" follows these steps:

**1. Synthesis of the Xanthine Skeleton (The Caffeine Core)**

Caffeine is a methylated xanthine. On prebiotic Earth, the xanthine skeleton could have formed in non-aqueous or concentrated environments (like drying lagoons) from simple precursors:

* **Formamide Pathways:** Neat formamide, under catalytic conditions with minerals like **calcium carbonate** (CaCO₃) or **zeolites**, can generate purines including xanthine and hypoxanthine.
* **HCN and Ammonia:** Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia, common in the early atmosphere, can polymerize to form adenine and other purine precursors through free-radical reactions. 

**2. Prebiotic Methylation (The Transition to Caffeine)**

To turn xanthine into caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), specific methyl groups must be added.

* **Methylating Agents:** Simple molecules like **methanol** or **methylamine** (formed prebiotically from formaldehyde and ammonia) could act as methyl donors.
* **Mineral Catalysis:** In the presence of reactive minerals at hydrothermal vents, these methyl groups can be transferred to the nitrogen atoms of the xanthine ring. While plants use complex enzymes (N-methyltransferases) for this, high-energy prebiotic environments can facilitate similar transmethylation reactions with high yields. 

**3. Formation of Chlorogenic Acids (The ""Coffee"" Antioxidants)**

Chlorogenic acids (CGAs), which give coffee its bitterness and health benefits, are esters of **quinic acid** and **caffeic acid**. 

* **Aromatic Building Blocks:** Aromatic rings like those in caffeic acid can form via the **shikimate-like pathway** or through the prebiotic condensation of small hydrocarbons (like acetylene) under volcanic heat.
* **Prebiotic Esterification:** In fluctuating volcanic pools, where cycles of wetting and drying occur, quinic acid and caffeic acid can undergo **spontaneous esterification** to form various isomers of chlorogenic acid. 

**4. ""Prebiotic Roasting"" (The Final Flavor Profile)**

The complex aroma of coffee comes from the **Maillard reaction** during roasting.

* **Early Earth Mimicry:** Impact events or volcanic heating can trigger Maillard-like reactions between prebiotic sugars (formed via the **formose reaction**) and simple amino acids (like glycine).
* **Melanoidin Formation:** These reactions produce high-molecular-weight molecules called **melanoidins**, which are responsible for the dark color and prebiotic potential found in modern coffee grounds. 



So how much of it could be plausible do you think? Was there a prebiotic ""Brew"" available on the early earth?

(On second thought, I should have asked it about other interesting compounds for prebiotic synthesis as well, e.g. the one Walter White would have been proud of).

At the time his dad was very sick and I didn’t want to separate my boyfriend from his family because his dad was basically in the process of passing away. I left behind all of my friends and family when I moved. 

My boyfriend has been showing very guilt tripping, controlling, and plain out rude behavior lately more than ever. We have had our few arguments and issues and did our best to resolve them. He would get upset and walk off from me and shut hisself into the bedroom and I’d be left to pick up the pieces by myself every single time. He likes solitude and to isolate where as I do not. At first it was okay it was great being with him but after a while I need friends to chat with or want to go shopping with a friend or go get a cup of coffee with a friend. The isolation and loneliness is depressing and upsetting to me. 


Recently we traveled back to Florida so I could see my family and friends and have Christmas with my family. From the second we got there he made comments about my house. He called it dirty, said we were raggedy people, etc. I have spent this trip walking on eggshells and being so upset with his nasty comments and ugly behavior that is quite embarrassing to me and to my family. 

Tomorrow we are going back to Washington and I hate to go back. I really honestly do not want to go back. I need to because my puppy is at a pet resort there and I can’t trust he would take care of my puppy until my mom and me get there to pack my stuff. 

So I am thinking of going back to Washington and picking up my puppy.

So I am thinking of going back to Washington and picking up my puppy. Giving it about a week or two window of time and see if he changes for the better or if this continues and if it does continue I’ll call my mom tell her make your way here to get me and my puppy. My mom is very much willing to come and get me. I’ll wait until she’s a little over half way there and then tell my boyfriend look I’d like to go home for a while it’s nothing against you but I’d like to be surrounded by my family and the comforts of my own home for a little while. I don’t think that conversation with my boyfriend will go very well. 

I feel like it is justified to want to come back home but I just feel so guilty about it. I feel like I am a bad person or partner for wanting to come back home. Please if you have any helpful advice let me know. I am truly at a loss here and I genuinely just don’t know what to do or where to start. ",0,1766891867.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

Title: THE DEADLY SAVANNA EXPEDITION
(Scene opens with a tense silence. The camera shakes violently. Alex Junior, Solar Flare, and Green Shadow are hiding behind a tiny bush that clearly doesn't conceal them.)
Alex Junior: (Whispering in a volume that's still a muffled scream) WE'RE HERE... IN THE SAVANNA... SEARCHING FOR THE MOST DANGEROUS BEAST OF ALL...
Solar Flare: (With coffee-bloodshot eyes, holding a camera that's on fire) I'M GOING TO TAKE THE HOTTEST PICTURE OF THIS PLACE!
Green Shadow: (Tries to be the voice of reason, but his mask is crooked) Guys, be quiet! If the lion hears, we—
Alex Junior: (Interrupts with a FUR SLAM on a nearby rock) SHUT UP, GREEN! LOOK OVER THERE! A... A... A LITTLE KITTENTTTTTT!

(Camera cuts abruptly to a yawning lion. Alex Junior begins to physically vibrate until he becomes a blur of colors.)
Alex Junior: (High-pitched 120-decibel scream) NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

(He jumps out of the bush striking completely broken anime poses, with his arms at impossible angles.)
Solar Flare: (Running over Alex) GET OUT OF THE WAY, I NEED THE FOCUS!

(Solar Flare starts hitting the camera like a drum. The camera explodes in light, blinding everyone.)
Green Shadow: (Screaming while running in circles) MY EYES! I SEE THE GAME'S SOURCE CODE! I SEE THE SUN!
Alex Junior: (Grabs the lion by the neck, not to fight, but to take a selfie) SMILE FOR DADDY, YOU BOA PUDDING!
(The lion makes a face of complete human confusion. Alex starts punching the table — which magically appeared in the middle of the savannah — while shouting unintelligible sounds.)
Alex Junior: (Pounding the table) THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! ART! PHOTOGRAPHY! STYLE! MONKEY! AAAAAAAAH!
Solar Flare: (Pointing to the horizon) ALEX! LOOK AT THAT! IT'S A ZEBRA WITH VERTICAL STRIPES!
Alex Junior: (Stops pounding the table instantly, neck stretches 3 meters) VERTICAL? VERTICAL?!
(The three start running towards the zebra, but instead of running, they slide across the ground while making sounds like malfunctioning airplane engines.)
Green Shadow: (Last sentence before the screen goes black) WHY DID I AGREE TO THIS?!

I desperately need help picking my machine. I was gifted a Delonghi Linea Classic by my partner but we're unsure if we should keep or do the bambino based on additional research. Can't really find as much detailed info on the Delonghi as I would like. Seems like the bambino is more popular but a little more dollars. Seems like the Breville has a few additional bells and whistles like PID and looks like no Panarello might be a plus, not to mention looks like the Delonghi has more plastic. 

My coffee goals are to be able to make something that rivals takeout coffee. Ease of cleaning would be a plus otherwise I'm not too picky. I just really wanna learn and grow and get to a point where I make a latte that makes me actually want to drink at home coffee again. I've been on a mokapot for a while but it just doesn't do it for me. 

I know the grinder is huge too, would like to keep that as close to $100 as I can. Whatever machine is reccoed would love the grinder you'd use with said machine. I'm just getting started so any other tips, tricks, or accessory reccos are welcomed.

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1pxgkes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWideContent/comments/1pxgkes/customizable_mobile_food_trailer_features_that/,Customizable Mobile Food Trailer Features That Improve Daily Efficiency,"In today’s fast-paced food industry, efficiency is everything. When you’re operating a food business on wheels, every second and square inch matters. That’s why more food entrepreneurs are turning to customizable mobile food trailers that come equipped with smart, flexible features designed to make daily operations smoother and faster. Whether you're serving tacos, coffee, or gourmet meals, the right setup can make a big difference in your workflow and customer satisfaction.

One of the standout features of modern food trailers is adjustable stainless steel countertops. These aren’t just sleek—they're also incredibly easy to clean and sanitize, which is a must when you’re preparing food on the go. Their durability ensures long-lasting use, even in high-traffic environments. Foldable or extendable prep tables give operators the flexibility to adjust the space as needed, depending on the menu or the day’s foot traffic. More counter space means more room to prep, assemble, and serve without clutter, keeping operations running efficiently.

Ventilation systems are another major upgrade in today’s food trailers. Good airflow isn't just about comfort—it's about safety and efficiency. Advanced exhaust hoods and built-in fans help maintain a consistent temperature, keeping the working environment cool while reducing the risk of smoke buildup. A well-ventilated trailer ensures your equipment runs at peak performance and your staff stays energized throughout the day.

Integrated storage solutions are also changing the game. Instead of wasting time searching for ingredients or tools, everything has its place—thanks to built-in cabinets, wall hooks, and magnetic strips for knives and utensils. This means faster prep times and less stress when the lunch rush hits. Some trailers even offer pull-out compartments and dual-layer shelving to keep things organized without taking up extra space.

The **customizable mobile food trailer** also features essential components like high-capacity sinks and easy-access water tanks. These upgrades allow you to stay compliant with health regulations and maintain hygiene with minimal effort. When water systems are built directly into the trailer design, cleanup becomes faster and more effective—something your staff (and your customers) will definitely appreciate.

With thoughtfully designed layouts, user-friendly installations, and space-saving features, customizable trailers are redefining what it means to run a mobile food business. They’re not just vehicles—they’re full-fledged kitchens built for speed, safety, and success.",1,1766891371.0,TheWideContent,0,1.0,False

* Big fan of hiking and yoga (heavy on the yoga during these trying times)


* Coffee and sweet treat lover. You get brownie points for putting me onto a new coffee shop.


* A certified yapper - this can be either good or bad for you depending on if you're shy and wanting someone else to take the reins.

* Good sense of humor (so you can laugh at my jokes)


* Brown eyes I can get lost in


* Someone local to the area (sorry to the Californian who's reading this. It's not personal. I just like a Jersey accent)

Or, how to thrive as a lawyer who’s a night owl?","As a late 30s applicant to law schools across Canada I have lived long enough to know I am not a morning person. If the science behind chronotypes is real then I am someone that gravitates towards starting my day later with my mental/energy levels also naturally peaking later. Any attempts I make to become a morning person are usually short-lived. It’s not caused by any health issues. Unfortunately caffeine has little effect on me as I metabolize it very quickly, if I’m feeling tired I can easily sleep right after drinking a coffee (Americano, even!).

It’s funny, I currently work at a courthouse and find I feel tired all day, but once the work day is wrapping up suddenly I get a second wind out of no where. It’s annoying, it’s as though my body and mind prank me daily. 

I feel absolutely pathetic over this and wonder how the hell am I going to handle the serious demands of being a lawyer one day if I can’t handle something as simple as getting my day going in the morning?!

The only time my body/circadian rhythm cooperates with feeling awake/alive/alert during the day and tired/asleep at night is when I go camping in a tent out in nature. I effortlessly do a complete 180 then. I also get my best sleep when I go camping. Too bad it doesn’t seem possible for a lawyer to combine their work life with camping life without getting their credibility or mental health seriously questioned should it come out that they willfully live in a tent!

Anyway, I don’t expect to ever be accommodated for being a night owl, but if I had it my way places like court would have evening shifts, starting later in the afternoon and run until 11pm, like Walmart! Feeling ashamed over this isn’t helping so instead I’d like to ask all you legal professionals here if there are any areas of law that are better suited for lawyers who are night owls? Comparatively, are there any areas of law that lawyers should avoid if they tend to be night owls? I imagine these would be practice areas that involve attending court. I know not everyone with a JD is a lawyer, so are there any careers suitable for night owls with JDs who don’t practice as lawyers? I am open to any suggestions or considerations that could help me find a niche or manage my night owl tendencies in the context of a legal career. Maybe that could mean working as a lawyer in Whitehorse where it’s total darkness for a few months out of the year. 

Surely I can’t be the first or only night owl interested in pursuing a career in law. I appreciate the opportunity to candidly share this here and look forward to your insight, but also understand if I just need to “suck it up buttercup”.

“It’s a church,” Mom said, staring at the stained glass windows of Jesus hanging on the cross. Her narrowed eyes and pursed lips told me she was clearly holding back additional commentary.

“It was a church,” I said. “Now it’s a bookstore. My bookstore.”

“What?”

“I bought it! That was the surprise!”

“I thought it’d be grandchildren. You made it seem like grandchildren, Lillian.”

“In fairness to me, I am increasing the flock.”

“Not funny.”

“Yes, it is,” I said with a smile. “I’m thinking of calling it ‘The Church of the Perpetual To-Read List’.”

“But it’s a church, darling.”

“In a previous life, yes, it was a church. Now it’s a bookstore.”

“Churches don’t have previous lives.”

“I know Christian dogma doesn’t allow reincarnation, but Jesus or his pals never mentioned that buildings can’t start over as something else.”

“I just don’t know who’d buy books from a church, is all.”

“Mom, the best selling book of all time is the Bible. I feel like you’re not understanding the basic premise here.”

“Lillian, I understand the basic premise. I just don’t understand why you picked this place to open a bookstore.”

“It was either this place or Kitty’s Whorehouse, but that place is still in business.”

“Oh, Lillian, please. In front of a house of worship,” she said, walking inside the building.

We were still moving in, so the building was half church, half bookstore, but it still received the full Mom judgment. She walked around, running her fingers over some pews and checking how dirty they were. Admittedly, they were still filthy because I was currently removing them, but the store was coming into shape. I was scheduled to open in two days, so I’d basically been living in the store to get it finished in time.

“So, I’m thinking of having new releases up front, couches where the pews are, the front desk floating in the middle, an entire section over here for romance and romantasy books, and a coffee stand with free mugs with purchase.”

“Don’t give away coffee, dear. It invites a slothful element. And what’s romantasy?”

“Books where fantasy creatures do what typically happens in the back of cars on prom night. Often in graphic detail.”

Mom crinkled her face. “And these kinds of books are popular?”

“The most popular.”

“No wonder the modern world is in the shape it is.”

“Lil, is this the last of the books?” Jason asked, taking off his well-worn Phillies cap and wiping his brow.

“This shipment, yes. But another one is due later today.”

“It never ends,” he said, shaking his head. “Jesus, this humidity is going to kill me.”

“Jason, please don’t blaspheme in the Lord’s house,” I said with a wink.

“I wasn’t blaspheming. I was appealing to a higher power.”

“Are you two quite finished with your little rat-a-tat?”

“We’ve been at this for days. I’m too tired for rats or tats,” Jason said. “What do you think of the place?”

“It has all the charm of a small-town church.”

“What we were going for,” I said, adding, “Praise be.”

“Amen,” Jason said.

“Well, your little jokes aside, I admire what you two are doing here. I’m a big fan of literacy and third places. You’re building quite a nice ‘hangout spot’ for the town, so kudos to you both.”

“Thank you, Mom,” I said. “Seriously, means a lot.”

“I knew you had it in you,” she said. “I didn’t imagine it’d take this long to find it, but better late than never.”

“There it is,” I said with a chuckle. “That’s the mom I love.”

“Did Lil tell you about the basement?” Jason said, changing gears.

“I didn’t know churches had basements,” Mom said. “Though I suppose you need a place to keep the crackers and wine for service.”

“You make it sound like they served hors d’oeuvres.”

“I think that’s where the priests used to live. Tight but cozy.”

“Noisy, too,” I said absentmindedly.

“What?” Mom asked. “How so?”

Jason looked at me, annoyed. I sighed; this was my mistake, and I was going to have to guide us out. “Well, sometimes, when you’re down there, you hear voices.”

“Voices?” Mom said, surprised.

“Voices, breathing, some knocking,” I said. “Could just be the church settling.”

“Or the good Lord making himself present,” Jason added, trying to smooth out my rough road.

“Jason, dear, if the walls are breathing, it’s not God’s work. Try the guy a little south of there,” Mom said, shaking her head. “Did you know about this when you bought the place?”

“Didn’t come up. We have since sacrificed a virgin to appease the gods, and that seems to have worked.”

“Very clever, Lil.”

“We’re making it our horror section,” Jason said. “It’s got the vibe for it. I’ve been working on dressing it up.”

“It’s his pet project,” I said. Just then, my mewing orange tiger-striped cat joined us and gave me the perfect chance to shift gears away from the breathing walls. “Speaking of, here’s Mookie Petts. He’s the grandson you were hoping for, Mom.”

“Lovely.”

“Hey boy, how’re things out in Sky’s End? Busy?”

He meowed, flopped onto his back, and rolled into my feet. I reached down and scritched his belly. He rolled back and forth for a bit before popping up, wrapping himself around my legs, and sprinting off into the church.

“Is it sanitary to have a cat roaming around?”

“Mookie is good people. Plus, he’s got a job. Keep mice and rats out.”

“It remains to be seen if he’s even capable of that,” Jason said. “So far, all I’ve seen him master is sleeping in the sunbeams from the stained glass.”

“He works at his own pace,” I said. “If you’re too hard on him, you’ll give him a complex. Then he’ll be a weird adult.”

“He might even buy a church and turn it into a bookstore,” Mom said with a nod. I laughed. She still had her fastball. “Is the basement ready to be seen?”

“Not just yet. Close though.”

“The body parts we ordered haven’t come in. It is so hard to find a reliable grave robber these days.”

“Jason, I don’t know how you put up with her.”

He hugged me around my waist. “Who doesn’t love a challenge?”

“Hey,” I said, playfully smacking him. “That and you love me.”

“That, and I love her.”

“We all do,” Mom said. “Though some days are harder than others.”

“It builds character, Mom.”

“Knock, knock,” came a sing-songy voice from the front door. We all looked over and saw Darcy, the town mayor, come sauntering inside the church. She was always this chipper, which is probably why she’d been elected six times in a row. That and nobody really wanted to be mayor. In a place as small as Sky’s End, there really wasn’t too much to do. It was the perfect job for someone who needs to stay busy with minor tasks.

“Darcy, how goes the mayoral dealings today?”

“Oh, you know, the fun never stops. Had to remind Jeff at Jeff’s Market not to feed the raccoons at night. I’m afraid he’s domesticating them.”

“I’ve seen so many of them around the church at night, I’m thinking of hiring them as security.”

Darcy sighed. “They’re not even afraid of people anymore. I went out last night to check on some noises I heard behind my shop, and I saw ten of them standing there just waiting for a handout.”

“Those things are disease-ridden,” Mom said. “Ghastly beasts.”

“They’re cute,” I said.

“No, your mother is right. They’re a blight on the city. We’ve worked long and hard to make Sky’s End a picturesque small town, and I won’t have roving gangs of raccoons ruining it.”

“Roving gangs? Is it like West Side Story? Rival raccoon gangs fighting for turf, the love of a pretty young thing, and to sing songs about their favorite dumpsters,” I said.

“You laugh, but when they’re crawling inside this place, eating your books, you’ll want them gone too,” Darcy said. “But I didn’t stop by to talk about the night bandits - not this time, at least - I came to see if you were still on track for the opening date?”

“Ugh, yeah, I think so,” I said, turning to Jason to help confirm.

“We should be good enough to open. Might still have a few odds and ends to finish, but we’re on track.”

“I hired the best contractors,” I said, slapping Jason on the butt.

“Well, that’s great to hear! The Harvest Festival is the premier event on the Sky’s End social calendar. The night walk to St. Asbeel’s Church is a storied tradition handed down from the town’s founders. It’s essential that we keep the tradition going. The town will pillory me if I screw it up. We’ve already promised our sponsors that we would be ready to go. We have to be ready to go.”

“I know it looks dusty in here, but we’re going to be okay.”

She surveyed the construction and shook her head. “Are you sure? I know you’re new to the town, so the importance of this may be lost on you, but….”

“Darcy,” I said, interrupting her nervous breakdown, “if my man says we’re on track, I believe him. We’re golden.”

She turned to Jason. “Are you sure?”

“Positive. It looks worse than it is.”

“My daughter is a lot of things, but a liar isn’t one of them. If she says it’ll be done, it’ll be done.”

“I give you permission to unclench,” I said, touching Darcy’s tensed shoulders.

She must’ve believed us, because her whole body relaxed. She smiled and gave me a small clap. “Sorry to come across as manic, but there are so many people who look forward to this event, and I just want it to be special.”

“And you’re up for re-election, right?” I joked.

She smiled. “Well, that might be a secondary reason, yes. You are a bright one.”

“At least 60 watts,” I said.

“Well, I will leave you to your, uh, cleaning? I look forward to seeing it all done,” she said. She saw the sign for the large romantasy section and squealed in delight. “Oh my! Is this area going to be all romantasy?”

“Yes, ma’am. All the fairy lovin’ fun that’s fit to print.”

She lowered her voice and smiled. “Don’t tell anyone, but that is my favorite genre! So spicy yet so fun!”

“Your secret is safe with me,” I said. “Come by when we officially open, and I’ll let you take the pick of the litter. On the house.”

“I am going to take you up on that offer, dear!” Darcy said, nearly floating out of the building.

As she left, I turned to Jason. “Did I just bribe the mayor?”

“Sounded like it, Lil.”

“I think I just became involved in a political scandal.”

“I’d call you deep throat, but your mother’s nearby,” he whispered.

“Jason, dear, can you help me bring in my things from the car? I’d like to get my room set up before nightfall, and I’d hate to be accosted by roaming raccoons,” she said, apparently not hearing his joke or choosing to ignore it.

I kissed Jason on the forehead, and the two of them left to bring Mom’s stuff into our little house across the street. I watched them go and felt a strange emotion overtake me. Happiness. It felt weird, like putting your tongue on a nine-volt battery.

With everyone gone and Mookie running around doing God knows what, I had a little time to do a walk around the church and take stock of what else I needed to do. It was in these quieter moments that I allowed myself to push aside the joy of ownership and focus on what other chores we’d had to take on.

It was always our dream to open a charming bookshop in a small town. I’ve always been an avid reader, and Jason loves a project. The church coming up for sale wasn’t on our radar, but when we found the ad online - and the low price - we had to jump. Dreams don’t wait for the perfect time to happen - they just do.

It’d been a hectic month. Pulling the rows of church benches and pews was a nightmare, but once they were gone, the true vision of the store took shape. It was quirky and unique, but I found that all the best bookstores were. My favorite from childhood was an old, converted bank. The vaults held different genres. The owners had made a tunnel of books you could walk through. Local artists took up small corner offices where accountants had once toiled and now made something beautiful for all the patrons to see.

I wanted something like that - I found it in St. Asbeel.

The walls were adorned with exquisite stained-glass windows depicting the Stations of the Cross. When the sun reached midday, the store’s floor was bathed in a kaleidoscope of color. Above us was a spire that easily made us the tallest building in Sky’s End with a bell that would chime every hour. The heartbeat of the town. The grounds had flowering bushes, soaring oaks, and a greening copper statue of St. Asbeel himself looking out over the greenery. It was a perfect spot for a picnic or to read a chapter before heading back to work.

We were lucky we found this place.

I was in the former quiet room, née coffee cafe, when I heard the bell to the front door chime. Assuming it was Jason returning, I called out, “Hey, any chance you brought me lunch?” When there wasn’t a response, I turned around to see who had come into my clearly closed store, but didn’t see anyone.

“Jason? You here?”

Nothing. I walked out into the store’s central area and looked around. I didn’t notice anyone else in there, but I felt a presence there. Another energy. Sounds woo-woo, I know, but you know the charged feeling you get when you’re around others. I had that, but apparently I was the only one.

“Mookie, if you figured out how to ring the bell, I swear to God,” I started, but stopped when I heard footsteps heading down the stairs. I knew Jason had been determined to get his horror section into shape, but it was unlike him not to let me know he had come back.

I made my way to the stairs as quietly as mice wrestling on cotton and gave a listen. I didn’t hear any footsteps anymore. Instead, I heard a voice. It wasn’t Jason’s.

It also wasn’t clear, like hearing a radio through a wall. You know someone is talking, but the language is just word-shaped gibberish. Sims speaking to each other - clear as day to them, but leaving their creator guessing what the hell they mean.

I took a hesitant step down and cocked my ears as if I were fine-tuning the radio. Fiddling with the knobs until the static cleared and I could hear a Red Hot Chili Pepper’s song I hated anyway. Another step down toward the basement. Leaning forward, bracing myself on the banister. I could almost make out what they were saying. It was something like —

BOOM!

A book on the shelf behind me fell to the floor with a crash. I gasped as if someone had been choking the life out of me and nearly tumbled down the stairs. I spun around, expecting to see a ghoul rising from the floor, ready to possess me, but instead heard the soft, friendly trill from Mookie. He lay down on the shelf and knocked off two more books.

I caught my breath, laughed, and brought my forehead against his. “You’re so lucky you’re darling because otherwise I’d boot you outside to fight off those gang-affiliated raccoons.”

Once my heart jumped back into my body and started working again, I leaned down to listen for the voices, but heard nothing. I chalked it up to a radio outside and decided just not to think about bell ringing or the footsteps I’d heard. If there were ghosts, let them be welcoming. I can’t have them scaring away sales.",3,1766890945.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

No party, no gifts, nothing like that. I mostly wanted a couple texts or maybe someone suggesting coffee. I have a pretty tight friend group, we have a group chat thats active every single day. Memes, complaints, voice notes, all of it.



My birthday came and went and nothing. Not one message. I told myself its fine, people are busy, adults forget dates. The next day though there was huge drama in the chat about one friend feeling excluded from plans that havent even happened yet. Everyone jumped in with paragraphs and voice notes and checking in and reassurance. It went on all day.



Thats when it hit me harder than I expected. I wasnt mad exactly but I felt small. Like I dont need emergency attention but it sucked realizing no one remembered my birthday but they all had energy for imaginary conflict. I didnt say anything. A few days later someone casually asked how my birthday was and I said oh it already passed. Then there was a flood of sorry omg I cant believe we forgot messages.



Now Im stuck feeling guilty for still being hurt. They apologized and said it wasnt intentional. I believe them. At the same time I cant shake the feeling that if I disappeared for a week nobody would notice unless there was drama attached. I dont want to be needy or make this a bigger thing than it is.

1. Does the interviewee start the coffee tasting? If so, how do you transition into it upon introducing yourself?

2. Should I have the coffee brewed/food pairings prepared before sitting down/starting the interview?

3. Would I be docked ‘points’ for using the Vertica instead of the pour-over method?

Yes, you read that right. 

My son is 12 and he has a classmate that has a big crush on him. She asked him to come to church with her for their Christmas party last week. I figured it would be okay, so I agreed to take him.

It was... weird. Aside from helping my son's scout troop I haven't been to a church service in a while (and his troops is at a UMC church, which is really nice). This place had all the trappings of a typical suburban megachurch: Large campus, coffee bar, humbletron over the stage, over-the-top worship leader. I grew up Wesleyan in a smaller church, but this was one of those big non-denominational ones. 

When I was there it was just so weird. I hadn't been to a service at all in years and had never been to this church at all, yet it hit so many familiar beats that I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable, like I was back at the church I grew up in that taught such a hollow Christofascist message. I just didn't know any different then.

Even the sermon itself took a turn. The pastor read from the first chapter of Matthew while pointing out the flawed people in the geneology of Jesus, and how that all still led to Jesus. I was impressed that he called out David specifically as a rapist and defending Bathsheba (IYKYK), but then it just devolved into the same old ""The blood of Jesus is enough to fix everything.""

It's a message I have heard my entire life. It is basically ""rub some Jesus on it"" theology. All problems, big or small, can be solved with some Jesus. Addiction? Jesus. Divorce? Jesus. Car didn't start? Jesus. It's so dismissive too. It dismisses real life struggles because they are only there ""due to sin"", thus it is your fault.""

Overall the church had some positives and was okay, but even though I knew every step of the ritual, I still felt terribly out of place. 

And no, I did not go to the ""Connect"" table. ",4,1766890544.0,Exvangelical,2,0.84,False

Samples:

\- match made in heaven 

\- snow moon magic 

\-2am in Lafayette 

\- where the wild things grow I

Oil:

English major 

Edp 30ML

in dreams and fairy tales vanilla

2am in Lafayette

I blind bought the last two because I desperately wanted full sizes and not just samples I’m so glad I did because I do like them! 

My thoughts so far:

Some last longer than others on my skin I heard this was the case with lighter perfumes 

So far match made in heaven stays super well on me! 

Also where the wild things are I literally sprayed it on my arm and the day after I could still smell it. Honestly because of that it makes me want a 15ml even though I wasn’t the biggest fan!

\- where the wild things grow: I think everyone I saw was describing this as a fresh realistic strawberry but to me the only thing it smells like is this deep candy like strawberry which mellows out and becomes such yet sweet strawberry scent but it’s definitely not realistic it’s I think it’s the notes of greens that make it seem more green than it actually is. I think I would give it a 3/5 I would use this in the summer or spring in my hair as oil I think it would be very garden fairy like but more on the younger fairy not the garden mossy fairy.

\- 2am in Lafayette: it’s super coffee forward at first all you get is coffee then it slowly dries into a almost boba smelling cafe to me. I couldn’t figure out what that nostalgic scent was maybe because I frequent boba shops instead of coffee shops I smelled brown sugar boba pearls ! 5/5 I love this for the winter but I live in Florida ! 

\- idaft vanilla - I get the chamomile note a lot and I love it the only thing is that this and snow moon magic literally don’t last longer than an hour or so for me 🙂maybe I’ll have better luck with the oil? It’s really pretty too I thought it would be this sweet vanilla but its not it’s more like a fresh herbal vanilla. I feel like I’m out in a field of flowers and it’s so relaxing and soothing. My favorite just because it’s so wearable in the heat! 4/5 because it doesn’t last long on me but that smell is addictive 

\- match made in heaven - 5/5 I don’t have words because I thought it would be a strong ass matcha but it’s smooth and it smooths out to be a sweet creamy matcha latte honestly BUT with the cherry blossoms it’s the perfect spring summer  scent to me honestly ! I need this in 50ml/ 100ml asap.

\- snow moon magic:  it’s spicy it’s chai but it’s not spicy spicy it’s more like spices spicy like you’re making some sort of cinnamon (chai instead but I usually make cinnamon milk ) milk. It once again smooths out and leaves traces of chai into a sweet Cookie. People say it’s butter cookie but to me it’s if you mixed vanilla and chai and milk … I don’t really get BUTTER but it is smooth so I can see where it’s butter cookie to some people. 5/5 as a bedtime scent  its soothing I feel relaxed and I do get lavender  its  super calming and makes me sleepy I just wish it lasted longer but as long as I can fall asleep with the scent idc I love it and I need it in 30 ml so I can sleep in peace.

\- last but not least English major. I don’t even know how to describe this but it’s old books and floral I’ve never smelled Orris before and it is a note so I’m guessing it’s that but it’s also earthy and sweet but not IN UR FACE  it’s more like soothing sweet like a trace of sweet. It’s pretty I got the oil and I put it in my hair  just owith my finger tips! It smells so nice kinda fresh kinda earthy. I don’t know how to explain it but it does give library but not the new ones the old libraries. Imagine an older library while it’s spring and raining and ur sitting there wearing some sort of sweet perfume. I can’t put my finger on what that sweet scent is but maybe u have a donut or something while you’re reading the book. That’s what it’s like it’s such an interesting smell I can’t help but to admire it! It does give me English teacher for sure so English major lives up to its name. 5/5 so unique and the imagery is very nice.

I (38F) have been married to my partner for 17 years. We have a very strong, stable relationship, and our marriage is open. We both have had explored other relationships of all kinds (emotional, romantic, ect.) however I currently am not talking to anyone else.

About two years ago, I started talking to someone else. We met while I was taking a course—she was actually one of my instructors. After the course ended and I was no longer her student, I reached out to her with a question. That eventually led to regular conversations and occasional meetups. Sometimes we would meet professionally, and other times just for fun—coffee, meals, or hiking.

At first, it felt like a really lovely friendship. She identifies as straight (or at least she’s currently in a relationship with a man and, to my knowledge, has only been in relationships with men), and I’m married to a woman. I’ve met her boyfriend, and she’s met my wife. Despite that, we’ve never discussed the nature or boundaries of either of our relationships.

I’ve known I was attracted to her from the beginning, but I never intended to take it anywhere. However, over the last few months, things seem to have shifted. We’ve developed a deeper emotional connection, and she has casually acknowledged a “connection” between us in an off-the-cuff way. I’ve absolutely felt this connection too, but I assumed it meant something different to me than it did to her.

About a week ago, she said she loved me. She said it as I was leaving and didn’t really leave me room to respond. She seemed shy and almost embarrassed—she looked away immediately and started rambling—so I didn’t get a real chance to reply.

Now I’m worried that she meant it in a purely platonic way, like how some women say “I love you” to close friends without deeper romantic meaning. I do have feelings for her, but I’m afraid to say anything because I don’t know if she feels the same way—especially since she doesn’t know my marriage is open, and I don’t know what her boundaries are in her own relationship.

I’m scared to admit my feelings and be wrong, but I also feel like it might be important to be honest.

THE BEGINNING SYMPTOMS:

  
Sep 2024 - Both my hubby and myself started having GI upset. We both started having heartburn and indigestion mainly with fatty foods. I have one particular incident when I really feel I cannot burp and I was miserable for a full night because of a slow digestion. Family MD prescribed us Pantoprazole as he think this is an issue of GERD.

  
CHARACTERISTIC AND LIFESTYLE PRIOR TO SEP 2024

  
Age range: 35-40

Hubby- M, non smoker, occassional alcohol consumption, works in health care moderate - high stress situation, no history of GI issues, can eat anything under the sun

Self - F, non smoker, occasional alcohol consumption, works in heath care moderate - high stress situation, caffeine consumption (2-3 cups daily), history of stomach upset (epigastric pain) that is easily relieved by Tums or gaviscon. Cannot have shellfish - cannot digest well. I have also decided to use non dairy milk (almond and oat milk) from Dec 2023 as I thought it is healthier.

July 2024 - Hubby got into idea of intermittent fasting - skipping meals as he fear having diabetes (runs in his side of family) and cholesterol issues. He wanted to trim his weight. 

July - Aug 2024 - We have indulged to espresso due to a new espresso maker. My hubby who isn’t a coffee drinker - has also joined me on afternoons drinking some with him drinking it on empty stomach.
  
THE ISSUE AS IT DEVELOPS AND INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PATHWAY

  
Fast forward to Oct 2024 - we were on PPI. Hubby felt his symptoms getting better until we went to a potluck party and that is where he picked up H.Pylori.

As for myself, the bloating continues and more food intolerance started to show up with the worst being rice. For the love of God, I started eating rice as early as age 6 mos and all of a sudden I cannot digest it. I ended up testing positive with Hydrogen dominant SIBO and will post a separate link for my full documentation of treatment.

  
THE SUPPORTIVE AND RECOVERY PHASE:

  
We made major adjustment in our diet and lifestyle apart from taking medications.

*  Gluten Free Oatmeal - is the most basic easiest meal we can tolerate during the early phase. It has been now a breakfast staple and really gentle on stomach. We only add honey to it initially. Now we have flax seed to it and cinnamon and sometimes maple syrup.
* Low Histamine and Gluten free diet - we avoided gluten at all cost not because we have gluten insensitivity but rather it is easier on the stomach. I have baked our own breads and pastries using ground gluten free oatmeal and almond flour. We avoided red meat and our protein source is soft boiled chicken and steamed fish or shrimp or scallops. We now stayed with fish and shrimp as staple for the weekdays. While we can now eat occassional red meat, we have stayed on eating fish and shrimp most of the time as it is easier on digestion.

* We went dairy free for the first three months. I can use egg as binder for my baked goods but never eaten as meal itself until three months. We stick to soft boiled to medium boiled eggs and white is easier to digest than the yolk. Coconut milk without binders worked for us on our baked goods. Now we can have occassionnal ice cream but those without binder (gums) and just whole milk.

* Warm water for the most part of the day for both of us. Faint black tea for me in the morning and no coffee from Dec 2024 to Aug 2025. I can now drink coffee ocassionally during the weekend but very seldom. If I am missing it - I drink decaf - pour over style
* Walking post meals, lots of sunshine during summertime and good sleep hygiene.
* During the time we did not eat rice, our carbs is from sweet potato, potato and carrots. All boiled. We reintroduced rice in May 2025 and we started with basmati rice. Now we can eat even fried rice- of occassion and moderate amounts.
* Papaya is the choice of fruit for digestion and we eat this post lunch or dinner when we have bigger meals. We now reintroduced grapes with no issue. No raw greens. No beans or lentils
* No spicy,no acidic no tomato based no heavily fried food up until this day. We still haven't tried nuts either.
* No alcohol since Sep 2024 for both of us.
* DGL is a helpful support and we have it in our shelf but barely used it now.Probiotics is another helpful supplement. 
* We stayed away from processed foods and we don’t missed it at all. Read labels and make sure no guar gums carageenan or xanthan gum used (I avoided those even during my gluten free baking days) and up to this day- even for milk we use whole milk wothout those additives/stabilizer.

Praying and meditation helps during periods of high stress and we also do herbal teas at night like Jasmine flower or guava leaves midday, if we knew we have been subjected to high stress at work.

  
At the time of this post, we are grateful that we were able to have a great Christmas celebration, full on eating without GI issues, or relapse.

  
We still treat our tummy like it is of a toddler state - meaning we are very careful on what we put in, prepare our own food and be mindful of what is happening day to day. 

May our shared experience be a source of information to those of you that may be struggling at this time. Finding the cause is the first step and committing yourself to recovery and changes is just as important.

For weeks the group of kids have been getting their butts kicked in the city wide snowball fight. The lower district just has too many older kids and the younger kids in the upper district couldn’t possibly win. 

That was until one of the kids found the Guardian at a cafe laughing with his fire team. With puppy dog eyes the young boy tugged on the Titans mark and made his case. It was short and sweet but in the end the Titan tussled the little kids head and agreed to help.

The next snowball fight was the weekend. The upper district kids quickly made as many snowballs as they could before their competition got there. A snowball hits the ground next to them and the fight begins.  

Throwing as hard as they could they tried to hit the older kids but always came a little short or just missed their target. The older kids lined up and sent a volley of ten snowballs to hit the kids, this would wipe out half of them! Suddenly a towering barricade appeared and blocked the snowballs. 

Looking shocked the older kids searched for nearby guardians, but only adults were present to watch the competition. The younger kids sent their volley and took out three of the older kids and cheered happily. Behind their igloo the titan snickered as he hid from sight.

Feeling anger the lower district kids made bigger snowballs. Throwing them as hard as they could. Before the snowballs could reach a green kunai hit the snowballs out of the air. The older kids called foul but couldn’t prove foul play. The hunter snickers from the roof invisibly as she twirls her strand kunai in her hand. 

All that remained of the lower district kids was the oldest hidden behind a snow wall they had built. He was well hidden and was hitting the younger kids one by one. All that remains is a little girl. She takes a deep breath and runs at the snow wall with a little war cry. 

Her little steps are not steady in the snow but her determination was there. Taking a sip of his coffee a nearby warlock grins and snaps his fingers to send soft flames at the wall. The wall melts leaving the older boy confused an exposed. Throwing with all her strength the little girl hits him in the chest and the war was won! 

The young kids cheered and yelled as they had finally won. The older kids went home with a grumble. Walking down the street three guardians walk side by side and fist bump each other as they walk back to the tower. 

This is what it’s all for. To keep the people safe and happy. ",1,1766890333.0,destiny2,0,0.6,False

IN THE WEEDS:

Some  basic assumptions in there are variable to our geographic region (Milke type, milk cost, did you buy bottomless portofilter? How much does a latte cost near you? Bag of beans is super variable too)

My assumptions:

$5 / gallon of milk, bought 2.2# of beans then 12oz bag of beans, my machine was  cost was $500, and I’ve learned recently - I need to buy those pods to clean the machine and not just descale.  Lattes near me are $6-$7 without tip.

Can’t thank this thread enough for all your support!

So, I really didn’t know where else or who else to talk to, so I wanted some opinions. I (M 31) have always been more of an introvert, shy and more or less lacking in self confidence. I’ve struggled with putting myself out there and then in the end ending up in shitty toxic situations with guys that just want to walk all over me. (I realize this isn’t just a me experience unfortunately)..

I’ve never been the type that wants to go out drinking, partying or clubbing. I’m very much a homebody. However, I feel like I’m immediately shut down by every guy for not wanting to indulge like that. I mean when I was 21 or 25, sure. But now, I just don’t have any desire for it. I like to go have a drink at lunch or something but not stay out all night and evening or pregaming and drinking.

I don’t know what to do. I feel isolated for being this way, but I also don’t want to sacrifice that boundry to maybe ultimately end up with a guy that is fine with being more chill for awhile only to realize I’m “boring” as my previous partners have called me.

For context, I love to go do things like bowling, hiking or be outdoors, try new restaurants or coffee shops, go window shop or thrift. But apparently those are considered boring to most people? I don’t know.

I’m just tired of feeling alone and like I’m the only gay man in my area that prefers the calmer life. Any thoughts or perspectives are appreciate.. thanks :)",25,1766890232.0,AskGaybrosOver30,33,0.86,False

Don't get too much coffee from it tbh. Mainly smells like a caramel ice cream off my skin but man is it good! Very sweet but not cloying. The ice cream note has a nice ""cooling"" vibe so it's not too thick and headache-inducing.

1pxg4l5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxg4l5,I spent 6 months working alone this year to finish the demo of my game.,"Recently, I’ve been working on the demo of a café game where there’s much more than just making coffee.
The game focuses on building bonds with characters, featuring cutscenes and events that change depending on the drinks you serve to each customer.
I put a lot of work into this demo over the past few months — often sleeping less than 5 hours a night to stay focused on the project while handling other responsibilities.
Still, I’m really happy with how the game turned out. There isn’t any gameplay footage yet, but that’s part of the process.

1pxg2ve,https://i.redd.it/fi22xvkxyu9g1.jpeg,My Christmas letter from homophobic BIL and sister,"TW: Homophobia.

I received this letter from my younger sister and BIL along with a Christmas gift when I visited my parents for Christmas.

For context, they sat me down in February and told me I was going to burn in hell for dating a woman, that I was no longer a Christian, could no longer be around their children alone, that they felt ""burned"" and ""betrayed"" by my decision (!!) to live a ""homosexual lifestyle"".

I begged my sister to reconsider, and tried to explain that we could agree to disagree. She refused, saying that there was no possibility of a close relationship unless I was willing to examine my beliefs with them. I was devastated. She has three small children and I have babysat all of them, taken time off work to help her, sat with her in the hospital nursing her newborn while she had emergency surgery, etc.

Since then, they reached out twice to ask to go out for coffee, which I refused as I was busy both times. I also have no interest in making small talk with them at family events and have made that very clear (by shutting down conversations).

I don't know what to do with this letter. I got seriously ill this year from the stress of this situation and I am so angry. How do I respond? My BIL also wrote a letter to my girlfriend.",32,1766889939.0,Exvangelical,47,0.95,False

It's been a hot minute, but i am back with a NEW tale of Contrary Mary! She has had a few moments of justnos, but it was not worthy of posting. WELL, she had one yesterday. 


 Tw: Screaming, Swearing, Destruction of Flatware and an unhinged me.

 Twas the day after Christmas, and Cm was in her room. She calls me (I wear headphones cuz the universe is loud) and asks for cereal with coffee. Now, I go her room for clarification and she listening to that Christmas song (""Sleigh ride"" I think? I don't really remember the name) and it has a ""clappy"" part, so when it gets to the clapping part I clap. 

 CM mistook it for god knows what and starts snapping at me, so I leave and get her coffee with cereal.  I bring her coffee first but then goes back to the kitchen for her cereal.  She then starts going off on the portion size. So as I am leaving the room she says something about me ""not doing anything for her"".......

 I snapped and LAUNCHED THE BOWL OF CEREAL TO THE GROUND!


 I drive her to doctor appointments. I drive my eldest (he blind) to stores, appointments. I HAVE HAD TO WIPE HER FUCKING ASS BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T REACH! 

 Y'all I went OFF! I started screaming and wagging my finger at her. Like I went from coherent English to just raptor roaring in this woman's face!

 Once I finished with my tantrum I looked at the mess I made and started cleaning. Then she starts going off again. I screamed ""CAN IT (Real Name), ITS DONE WITH! SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

 There were ceramic shards and cereal everywhere. I picked up the big pieces and vacuumed the rest.

 Now, here is the funny part. She always yells at me and blames me for her problems. And I would take it. I take everyone's problems and just internalize it. Yesterday was the day I finally had enough of her shit and snapped.

 Note: I help her with most things because she is disabled. 

 Hope y'all had a good holiday. Word of advice: Don't throw ceramics straight down. Throw at an angle.....",21,1766889723.0,JUSTNOMIL,6,1.0,False

I spend hours researching scents I already know I won’t like. I convince myself samples are “saving money.” I catch myself rationalizing bottles because they’re versatile or comforting or fill a gap that definitely exists.

Worst part? I’m happy. I love it. I don’t even want out.
