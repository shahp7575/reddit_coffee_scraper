Every square inch of the apt is covered in filth. The bed and couch reek of piss and shit from years of cats pissing on them. The carpets haven’t been vacuumed in years so they’re full of crap and even glass, the kitchen and bathroom tiles have never once been scrubbed so they’re disgustingly sticky and discolored in various spots. The stove is crusted with food and all of the burners are broken so everything cooks unevenly. The dishwasher barely cleans dishes and just molds them pretty much. The microwave and air fryer have never been washed and reek of old food, the windowsills have collections of random dead bugs on them. Every cabinet and drawer is unlined, unorganized, with random shit stuffed everywhere. Roommate neglects his cat’s litter box (which is in the common area) for up to two weeks causing the whole apartment to smell of rotting shit and piss, then even talks about getting another cat. 

When I first moved in I tried to help jumpstart the cleaning by washing all the dishes, cleaning out all the old food in the fridge, bought some new dishes and pots and pans, and organized the bedroom and coffee table/some common area. But there is so much fucking shit and nobody else is doing anything I just can’t do it. Also when I first moved in here there was hella of my bf’s exes shit here from well over a year ago that I demanded get thrown out and he listened. But now day to day I beg for him to clean and try working on the mess and he says he will but nothing happens. I work full time and he works part time 

It’s at the point where I wake up falling off of our tiny piss scented bed, get frustrated and go to the piss smelling couch in the piss smelling living room. I have CPTSD and Asperger’s and I’m on the verge of hurting myself like I just don’t know what to do every second being in this apartment is like torture my skin burns and crawls ",1,1762618112.0,depression,0,1.0,False

1ort2br,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1ort2br/costa_rica_itinerary_march_2026/,Costa Rica Itinerary (March 2026),"Hey everyone! My partner and I (both late 20s) are planning our first Costa Rica trip for late March 2026 and would love a quick sanity check on the itinerary. We’re flying in/out of Liberia, renting a car, and trying to balance jungle, adventure, and some proper beach time.

Right now, the plan looks like this:

* La Fortuna (3 nights) - classic volcano + hot springs part of the trip. Thinking a mix of hiking, waterfalls, hanging bridges, and just chilling in the evenings.
* Monteverde (1 night) - we booked this really cool Airbnb in the middle of the jungle with huge windows and bird views in the morning. Planning to do a night tour and maybe hanging bridges or a coffee tour the next morning before driving out.
* Guanacaste coast (3 nights) - still deciding between Flamingo, Potrero, Conchal or somewhere around there. We want that white sand, turquoise water, safe beach vibe but also want to explore a few beaches nearby instead of being stuck in one spot. Planning a mix of lazy beach days, maybe a catamaran sunset cruise, and a few short drives to places like Playa Danta, Penca, and Conchal.

Does this route and pace make sense? Would you add or cut any nights?

Also curious which spot would make the best base for the beach part, somewhere central enough to do little day trips but still have nice views and easy swimming.",1,1762617801.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

1ort0wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1ort0wt/the_secret_to_being_insanely_attractive_stop_only/,The secret to being insanely attractive: stop only talking to hot people,"You ever notice how some people just have it? That magnetic energy where people naturally gravitate toward them, regardless of their looks or status? Here’s the funny part: they’re not focusing on being attractive. They’re focused on being charismatic with everyone. Not just beautiful people. Not just potential dates. Everyone.

I started noticing how many guys are obsessed with becoming “high value” but only turn that energy on when they’re around people they find hot. Then suddenly, they don’t know how to hold a convo, become weirdly performative, or completely freeze. But charisma isn’t a switch. It’s a muscle. And if you’re only flexing it when you think there’s something to “gain,” it’s going to stay weak and awkward.

I’ve seen way too many TikTok dating “experts” give advice like “make eye contact but only for 3 seconds,” or “only speak when spoken to in high-value circles,” or whatever other garbage goes viral. Most of it feels like cosplay for people who don’t even like socializing. As someone with a PhD in human behavior, I’m telling you right now: this is not how social confidence or attraction actually works.

Want to be more attractive? Make it a daily habit to talk to everyone. Grandma on the bus. Dude in line at the coffee shop. The cashier. The new hire at work. No agenda. No flirtation. Just human-to-human contact. The kind that builds your social fluency. That’s what actually makes people like you, and yeah  want you.

Here’s a breakdown of the real stuff that works:

\- Charisma is a full-time habit, not a part-time performance. According to behavioral psychologist Olivia Fox Cabane (author of The Charisma Myth), charisma isn't something you either have or don’t. It’s a set of behaviors  presence, power, and warmth. Practicing those with everyone makes it feel natural when you’re with someone you’re attracted to. If you only “turn it on” during dates, you’re going to seem fake or nervous.

\- Social fluency beats pick-up tricks. Dr. David Buss, one of the leading experts in evolutionary psychology, found that long-term attraction is strongly influenced by social intelligence  being perceived as likable, emotionally expressive, and conversationally engaging. Not how calculated your opening line is.

\- Talking to strangers is linked with higher well-being. Research by psychologist Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago showed that people who had casual conversations with strangers on trains or buses reported significantly higher happiness levels than those who remained silent. We’re wired for connection. The more you do it, the more confident and fulfilled you feel.

\- Attraction is a side effect of social boldness. People remember how you made them feel, not how cool you sounded. Talking to everyone builds your ease with people, removes desperation, and increases your baseline confidence. That’s the stuff that makes people want to be around you  romantically or not.

Here’s how to start rewiring your approach:

\- Practice micro-interactions daily. Smile and say “hey” to a stranger. Ask someone how their day is going. Compliment someone’s shirt. These are like social push-ups. Do 5 a day.

\- Don’t be outcome-dependent. Stop expecting a reaction. These convos are about building reps, not scoring points. Irony is, people respond better when they feel you’re not trying to get anything from them.

\- Develop charisma through interest, not effort. Be curious. Observe more. Ask questions. According to Vanessa Van Edwards (author of Captivate), people find you more interesting when you make them feel interesting.

And if you’re ready to level up, here are some killer tools that helped me (and thousands of other people) sharpen this skillset:

\- Book: The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane  

  This is not your typical self-help fluff. It combines neuroscience, practical tips, and exercises that actually work. Cabane teaches you how to radiate presence, power, and warmth  without being fake. It completely changed how I show up socially. Best charisma book I’ve ever read. You’ll want to re-read it every year.

\- Podcast: Modern Wisdom by Chris Williamson  

  One of the smartest pods out there for personal growth. Tons of interviews with world-class communicators, psychologists, dating experts, and thinkers. There’s a great ep with Vanessa Van Edwards on human behavior and how to master first impressions.

\- YouTube: Charisma on Command  

  Their breakdowns of how celebrities and leaders speak are insanely actionable. Learn small tweaks in body language, vocal tone, even storytelling. Start with their breakdown of how Ryan Reynolds disarms people  it’s gold.

\- App: Finch  Self Care Pet App  

  Sounds odd, but it gamifies habit building and social goals in a super low-pressure way. Set daily challenges like “start a conversation with a stranger” or “give a compliment.” Keeps you accountable while your little bird avatar does backflips.

\- App: BeFreed  adaptive learning powered by AI  

  Think of BeFreed like your own personalized coach for growing social intelligence, confidence, and relationships. It pulls from books, expert talks, and real-life stories, then builds a podcast-style learning plan just for you. You pick your goals  charisma, dating, public speaking  and it gives you bite-sized episodes in 10, 20, or 40 min formats. You can even choose the voice tone of your AI coach (mine’s sassy and sarcastic, of course). What really sticks is how it adapts to your learning patterns and feedback over time. Also, literally every single book and expert I mentioned above is in their library.

This isn’t about becoming some extroverted alpha networker. It’s about reprogramming your everyday behavior to be a magnet for connection. Stop reserving your social skills for people you find hot. Be charismatic with everyone and watch how your whole vibe changes.

1orsxyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1orsxyi/please_help_long_story_in_body_short_story_is_the/,"Please help (long story in body). Short story is the girl i've been seeing, her dad hates me, and even though she still likes me were cutting off connection. What do I do?","I have been friends with this girl for about a year. Our story is very picturesque and tragic.

  
I used to go to her house (she lives in my neighborhood) when I was younger because my brother and her brother were friends. But I never noticed her back then, it was purely coincidental. I noticed her one year, and I followed her, but never thought anything of it since I realized she was two years younger than me (I'm a senior). Yeah, I know its bad. But, I lost a bet with my friend and he chose a random girl for me to ask out. It happened to be this girl. She said no back then. (January 2025)

  
However, we we became friends because she noticed I liked cats. I asked her how she knew, and she noticed that I liked all the cat reels on instagram. We talked and since I am older, I tried to take on the older brother persona and set a barrier between us. But people around me still thought she liked me. They'd say she blushed when my name was said, she wanted to watch my township's fireworks with me in June but was too scared to ask. She said that I ignored her calling my name multiple times, I never thought of her like that because of the ""older brother persona"", so I apologized.  She started going to our neighborhood's basin because I said I went there a lot. 

  
Two weeks ago, I noticed a change. I realized that she liked me. It was indisputable. She came at a great time. I was helping my friend (female) who had a crush on my other friend get together. Her friends thought I was bullying her just sending info. So they thought it was a good idea to get a girl who I asked out in June to pretend she likes me, and for her to text me. I didn't fall for it, but I was devastated that she would try to mess with my feelings, and my self-esteem was at an all time low. 

  
So I had to come to terms with whether or not I liked her, especially with her being a sophomore. I realized that maybe I had been hiding some of my feelings from back then as well. So I took a leap at it, and gave it my all. She said she acknowledged her feelings like three weeks ago. We were already friends so everything felt natural. I felt accepted for who I was, unlike other people I had talked to before. I had been asked out before, many times. But she never asked me out, it was just easy. 

  
I remember she let me put face paint on her before I realized, a little bit of peer pressure. But it was that day I realized. My friend drew 6-7 (yeah I know), and I drew cat whiskers. She said never draw again, then I was like wait but you'd let me draw again right bc I did good, and she was like yeah. Then there were text messages where she said like ""where's my itsuomi""(a sign of affection) to a reel I sent. She deleted it, and I asked what happened and she said ""I said where's my airpods, I dropped them"". 

  
I am the vice president of a club she attends. We were doing decorating and I put a sticker on her back. When I got home she texted me thanking me for the sticker and said she would keep it on the sweatshirt because it was cute. It was a crooked goofy looking frog. So, at this point I was pretty sure. So I tested her, I said ""I kinda feel like going on a walk but its gloomy"". She said ""then walk on the treadmill"". So I was like nah and went anyways, and 10 minutes later she was like yk what I don't feel like studying I wanna walk. But I was like, I'm already out here. So she said she couldn't go anymore. Then 10 minutes later she said she wanted to go out. Long story short, she stuck a different sticker on my back instead. I walked in the opposite direction of her house, and she walked towards her house, but we bumped into each other since our neighborhood is a circle. But she turned around like 100 feet away and started walking away. 

The next day I told her, instead of running away. How about you be my walk buddy? We walked for two hours just talking about everything. The day after that we watched a movie together at my house. We studied at the library together. I don't think I've ever took so many selfies before. I wanted her to only look at me, and I wanted no one else to look at her. She fits almost all of my criteria(used to make lists of what the perfect girl was don't ask), except for her family. 

It wasn't meant to be. Her dad(divorced) said I'm a druggy and a bad influence (i literally never met him, and I don't even want to drink coffee). He forbade her from seeing me other than the library. He wanted her to focus on her studies. In order to prove I could help I tutored her for five hours for free on the SAT. But, her goal is a 1570 since she wants to go to Duke. I am a good student, and I have the drive and willpower to succeed. I wanted to show that I am academically inclined. She is honestly very far from that goal, and I gave her many study materials to do so. 

  
But, yesterday, she said she couldn't do it anymore. She said she hasn't cried so much ever in her life because of the combination of me and her dad. I want her to be happy, I don't want her to cry, I want her to succeed. So, we essentially cut off connection. So many things remind me of her, and I'm honestly so cooked. I didn't just lose someone I liked, I lost a friend. It's not as if she didn't like me, it's because of her dad. Her dad said she could only date until after the SAT (March-June). I told her I would wait for her, I guess I'm silly because I will leave to college soon anyways, and it's just highschool right? But she said she didn't want to hurt me by making me wait. The end of our relationship would be so unsure, but I was willing to try no matter what. It's these experiences that mold us into who we are. I hoped to become a better person at least. She said she didn't even want to text behind her dad's back. Everything, is a reminder of what could've been. She wanted to lose everything we had just like that. I'm sure many things will remind her of me. I want to become a veterinarian and sent a lot of cat and dog reels. We played roblox and minecraft, talked about manhwa, talked about kdramas, and talked about anime. She loved my cardigan too. 

It's selfish of me, but I don't want to let her go. I can't let it end like this. I am waiting a couple days before I post a guitar cover for her (All I Ask by Adelle), and I wrote about a 727 word message talking about how I'm selfish and I still want to be with her, play games with her, tell her about my day, and watch movies and tv shows with her. I asked her to be selfish, don't think of my feelings. I don't care if I can't text you for months, I don't care if I can't see you, I'll wait. There isn't anyone else in this school I'd rather be with. You know, maybe in another life, maybe this could have gone differently. Her dad wasn't so resistant, maybe she lied and just said were friends, just maybe. Is this the right move? Her dad has so much resistance, and it feels impossible. But I want to try, and I feel like if I let her go, I will regret it for the rest of my life. But, if she doesn't even feel this way then it's okay. I want her to let me go, I want her to be happy. I caused unhappiness for her. I wanted to help her strike a balance between studying and fun. I even wrote a 2580 word essay to her dad I never sent to convince him. It's not the fact that I am me he won't allow it, it's just he thinks I am a distraction because I am a dude she is interested in. I never sent it. She saw my feelings about how I just want her to be happy and enjoyed her company. It's not like I want to have sex with her, no, my parents would kill me probably. I just, enjoy her company. She doesn't give me butterflies, she doesn't make my heart skip a beat, she just makes me feel calm. I've never felt like this before. 

This is the first time I have cried in three years, my dad gave me permission to in the car. He said it was healthy to. I still have her hair tie, her hair clip, and the pokemon card that we unpacked together. Should I give those back in the mailbox? She told me to throw them away, I can't bear to do that. I don't want to let go. I can't give up like this. I don't want my story to be tragic like this. I don't want to hold regrets for the rest of my life. My dad had a similar situation, and he still remembers it. I can't do that, I'm too similar to him. Or maybe, I am simply foolish for still hoping. I still have a life ahead of me, there's many girls in college.  But I feel like you don't find someone like this very often. When I told her I've never felt this way about a girl, she said, and there'll be another. But I would've at least liked to write a chapter with her. ",2,1762617518.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1orswqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1orswqd/the_canva_moment_for_advertising_assembling_ads/,The Canva Moment for Advertising — assembling ads instead of producing them,"Hey everyone,

I've been thinking a lot about where AI and marketing collide, and I believe we’re about to hit a massive shift — what I call **“The Canva Moment for Advertising.”**

\---

**Why this matters**

Every business, from a local coffee shop to Nike, needs ads. But ads are expensive, slow, and short-lived.

Unlike movies, ads aren’t meant to last — they exist for *exposure*.

Every new product launch, every trending meme, every viral moment creates fresh demand for fast, high-frequency content — keeping campaigns relevant and impossible to ignore.

That’s why brands spend endlessly: they have to keep their content fresh or vanish in the feed.

And here’s the kicker — this makes advertising one of the **highest willingness-to-pay industries** on earth.

\---

**The Pain**

Traditional ad creation is broken:

* Takes weeks of filming, editing, approvals.
* Costs thousands per campaign.
* By the time it’s ready, the trend is already gone.

The result? Most small brands can’t afford to keep up, and big ones are stuck paying for inefficiency.

\---

**The Idea — OneStop Advertisement Platform**

A creative AI system where ad production shifts from *creation* to *assembly* — where every part of an ad already exists in a searchable, modular **AI library**, ready to be **assembled** into new campaigns.

🎬 **Scene Templates:** thousands of pre-built ad storyboards — unboxing, testimonials, lifestyle reels, cinematic brand spots. Drag one in, tweak pacing, adjust tone.

🧍‍♀️ **AI Characters:** choose from a library of virtual models, presenters, or influencers. Edit voice, accent, emotion, even gestures.

🏷️ **Product Slots:** drop in your product image or 3D asset, and AI fits it seamlessly into the scene.

🎧 **Sound & Music:** pick mood-based BGM or auto-generated voiceovers in any language, synced perfectly with visuals.

📝 **Script Engine:** type your goal, and AI writes a short, catchy script tailored to your brand.

📱 **Auto Export:** one click to publish optimized versions for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

Just like Canva — but for ad creation.

\---

**The Business Model**

Freemium for small businesses. Pro plans for agencies and brands. Custom APIs for large-scale automation.

💎 **Freemium:** build basic ads using starter templates — watermark included. Perfect for small businesses that need speed.

💼 **Pro:** unlock premium templates, licensed music, brand-grade fonts, and advanced editing tools.

✨ **Personalization Layer:** upload your own product line, brand palette, logo, and voice — every ad instantly adapts to your identity.

🧍‍♂️ **AI Persona Upgrade**: replace stock presenters with your own digital spokesperson. A few selfies and voice samples to train your custom ad avatar — your brand’s face, 24/7, multilingual, perfectly consistent.

🧠 **Enterprise:** API integrations for agencies and marketing teams — with shared libraries, analytics, and automated A/B testing.

\---

**The real value? Speed + Relevance + Affordability.**

With AI assembly, brands can create dozens of micro-ads per week — fast, on-trend, and at a fraction of traditional costs.

What used to take agencies, studios, and thousands of dollars can now be done in hours, by anyone.

Advertising stops being static — it becomes alive, responsive, and affordable.

\---

**The Next Layer — Automated AI Influencer Platform**

A platform where virtual influencers are built, not hired — scalable, safe, and on demand.

On a single timeline, creators (or brands) can drag and drop from rich AI templates and categorized assets:

🎭 AI-generated characters

🎬 Dynamic scenes

🛍️ Product & brand placements

🎧 Auto-generated BGM

📝 Script & pitch generators

🎙️ Synthetic voiceovers (multi-language ready)

📱 One click to export for every social platform

Think Canva — but for influencer marketing.

Because AI influencers are:

⚙️ Never tired

🚫 Never scandalized

📈 Infinitely scalable

💰 Cost 1/1000th of humans

Soon, “influencer marketing” won’t mean *hiring people* — it’ll mean *assembling personalities.*

*---*

**The Vision**

A global ad platform where creativity becomes manufacturable, scalable, and one drag away.

Where anyone — a solo founder, a Shopify seller, or a billion-dollar brand — can instantly turn ideas into campaigns.

That’s the future I call **The Canva Moment for Advertising.**

Where creation is accessible, influence is automated, and creativity becomes a simple drag-and-drop.

\---

**TL;DR:** AI is about to automate ad creation the way Canva automated design. Whoever builds the “ad factory” platform first — wins.

1orswi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1orswi5/aitah_for_ignoring_a_friendly_girl_on_my_hall_at/,AITAH for ignoring a friendly girl on my hall at college?,"So I moved into my hall a few weeks ago, I met her in a coffee shop on campus and she stopped me to talk for a few minutes. After I left she followed me on instagram, I thought she was pretty but didn’t think much of it because she’s a sophomore and I’m a freshmen and she was probably just being friendly because I was new.

But I’d see her around and she’d always ask if I was going to hall events and stuff, then on a Friday night she and a few other people were out in the lobby area playing games. I joined them and she invited me to sit next to her, she was pretty chatty and we were pretty much right up against each other the whole time but again I didn’t think much of it because there wasn’t much space. Then the next day she messaged me on instagram asking me to come back since they’d be out playing again. So I joined them, we played games again but then she wanted to go out and do something so we went to some abandoned building with 2 other guys. The other guys kinda left us alone so it was just the two of us; she stuck around me a lot, which is when I started to wonder if she was actually interested.

But we went back and resumed playing games. Then she asked if I wanted to watch a movie so we watched movies for the next like 4 hours. This is when I made some moves, she was already sitting up against me again but I moved closer and started rubbing her arm lol, she didn’t react so I stopped. Then I put my hand on her leg and she didn’t react so I pulled back again. It’s tricky because I go to a Christian college so people are weird about guy-girl stuff so I couldn’t tell if she was timid or not interested. But she never pulled back so I kept going. But then she reached over to grab my arm and moved her legs into mine so I was like oh shit im onto something lmaoo. By the time we were done with the movie it was like 5am so we went to bed, I got up and she gave me a hug and we exchanged numbers.

Then I didn’t see her much for a few days because we have different schedules, so I texted her asking if she wanted to hang out sometime. She replied and said that she was uncomfortable with how physical it got that one night and that she wasn’t interested in a relationship, and that she “didnt want me to think she was giving off vibes that showed she was interested in more than friends”. At first I was like damn I must’ve read that wrong and I felt bad. But then I thought wait a minute, if that were all true in the moment then why did she reciprocate? I wasn’t all over her. I was nervous to try anything because everyone’s Christian and I wasn’t sure how she’d react. And she’s older than me. But I feel like if what she said was actually true she would’ve at least shifted away from me or something. Idk maybe she didn’t want to make it awkward or something. IMHO I think she was interested but didn’t expect me to do that and panicked because she thought it was lustful or some bullshit, she’s super Christian like she leads Bible studies and stuff lmao so that’s what I thought. But idk.

Regardless I’ve been ignoring her since, when she sees me she says hi but I either barely acknowledge her or just flat out ignore her lol. Like I feel a little bad because she is really sweet but leading me on then saying I made her uncomfortable when she was going along with it I think is craaaazy work.

1orstum,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1orstum/how_to_reduce_cigarette_butt_litter_build_or_buy/,How to Reduce Cigarette Butt Litter: Build or Buy Butt Ballot Bins!,"Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world — an estimated 4.5 trillion are discarded each year. They leach toxins like arsenic and lead into waterways, clog storm drains, and harm wildlife that mistake them for food. Despite this, many smokers litter simply because they don’t see convenient, engaging disposal options nearby.

The butt ballot bin turns that problem into a playful, visible solution — combining litter reduction with local engagement, art, and a dash of fun psychology.


The Problem: Why Butt Litter Matters 🌼 

~ Environmental impact: Butts contain cellulose acetate, a plastic that takes up to 10 years to break down and several other toxins. Rainwater carries these into rivers and eventually into oceans.

~ Public cost: Cities collectively spend millions cleaning up cigarette litter annually.

~ Business image: Litter near storefronts turns customers away and creates an impression of neglect.

~ Fire hazard: Smoldering butts can ignite dry vegetation or trash.

Encouraging proper disposal reduces costs, improves safety, and keeps communities looking clean and cared for.


The Solution: Build or Buy Butt Ballot Bins! 🌼 

A metal wall- or pole-mounted container designed with two to four clear compartments, each fronted by a replaceable voting image card. Smokers extinguish their cigarette on a centered metal ashtray plate before inserting it into the slot of their choice — effectively voting with their butt.

Each compartment collects butts under a glass or plexiglass front, so passersby can see which option is “winning.” Behavioral science shows people are more likely to engage when there’s a game element (“nudge theory”).


Key Features to Make It Viable 🌼 

~ Durable design: Rustproof steel body with powder coating, weather-sealed seams, and lockable bottom door for easy emptying.

~ Fire safety: Built-in sand or snuffer plate at the top to fully extinguish cigarettes before dropping and non-flamable material.

~ Interchangeable voting cards: Front windows hold postcard-sized images or printed questions.

Examples:

~ “Mountains or Beach?”

~ “Coffee or Tea?”

~ “Dog Person or Cat Person?”

~ “Favorite Local Landmark?”

~ Modular options: Two, three, or four sections to fit different locations and engagement levels.

~ Small top openings: Prevent trash or rain from entering while keeping usability easy.

~ Glass or shatterproof acrylic fronts: For visibility and easy cleaning.

~ Mounting flexibility: Attach to walls, poles, or free-standing bases for high-traffic areas.

~ Optional advertising strip with QR code for a sponsor

Business Opportunity 🌼 

~ Cafés, pubs, and music venues can adopt these to create buzz and goodwill.

~ Cities or tourism boards can brand them with local themes or rotating trivia.

~ Sustainable manufacturers or small metalworking shops could produce them locally using recycled aluminum or stainless steel, tapping into green procurement markets.


Real-World Examples & Inspiration 🌼

We’ve actually known each other for three years, so I care for him a lot. The first month and a half went really well. We saw each other every weekend or every other weekend. Then we started seeing each other less often, until I had to ask him (I couldn’t just assume) if he still wanted to keep seeing me. Two and a half weeks had gone by, and for me that was a long time. I missed him and I wasn’t sure he felt the same.

I understand his schedule: he works at a gym (I workout there, by the way) from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. He goes to bed around 11 p.m., and in the morning he works out. This every day. So the only time we can see each other is on weekends, and that’s completely fine! He told me that yes, he did want to keep seeing me, but that lately he’d been dealing with work and personal issues. Right after that, he invited me out.

The next day we went for coffee, he commented on his issues (creating workout routines for different people, lacking money overall, and thinking of moving out) and then I stayed over at his place. Everything was fine, except for one small thing: while we were watching a movie, there was a suic*de scene, and he said, “that’s me.” John jokes around a lot, but I still noticed some seriousness in what he said. I looked at him and told him not to say stupid things. And he went, “why?”, half laughing. I looked at him again with the most disapproving look, because I care about him and don’t want him saying those things about himself. That concerned me.

This week at the gym I noticed he looked really tired. Too tired. On Friday night (yesterday) I wasn’t planning to invite him out because I figured he’d want to rest, so instead I sent him a message:

“Heyy, I noticed you seemed tired this week and just wanted to send you some encouragement and lots of kisses. I’m here if you need anything.”

He hasn’t replied. He posted an Instagram story last night, so I know he straight up ignored my message. The story was a meme: Kim Jong-un hugging a soldier in an exaggerated manner, and the caption read “A hug like this could fix me.” Dark humor. Could mean something, could mean nothing. Since this week he’s turned off comments on his stories as well, he probably doesn’t want to talk to anyone. He’s mentioned having these kind of sad/overwhelming episodes before, which result in him shutting down.

He’s never ignored my messages before, so I’m worried. I’m worried about us, and especially about HIM, because I want to support him and I don’t know how. Maybe I’m reading too much into it and he’s just fine?

Please, be kind. I’m feeling upset about the whole situation. Thank you all!

1orssic,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1orssic/crosstown_roundabout_trail_modification/,Crosstown Roundabout Trail Modification?,"I’m a huge fan of the Crosstown trails. I was very excited to try the new Roundabout trail. I haven’t done the whole thing yet but started on the south side of the city. Unfortunately the south part of the trail spends a fair bit of time in Daly City-and some unpleasant parts of Daly City at that. Lengthy and difficult road crossings. At least two stints across the highway. Wanderings by parking lots. I’m imagining this is because they wanted it anchored next to BART, but could it be reached via an offshoot by Balboa Park BART (which happens to be adjacent to some awesome new S.F. development and excellent parks)? I love the South part of S.F., and a lot of people never make it to that part of town. Can we modify the Roundabout to show more of it? 

The stop at the Broderick Terry Duel site was peaceful and worth it. But I think it can be retained. 

I would propose:
-A cut to Ocean Avenue when going West from Cayuga Park (don’t miss Cayuga park-very cool). Lots of businesses, places for weary hikers to lunch or get coffee. Beautiful part of the city. This also means it would go by Balboa Park BART. And so many muni lines terminate here so easy to get to. The Powerhouse is right there (cool building). Downsides-that is farther North than the S.F. border. It would also need a route back to Lake Merced. Maybe via S.F. State?
-Or, the route continues due West on Brotherhood Way from the Brotherhood and Chester mini park. Then going South around Lake Merced and joining the original trail at the South edge. It can have a stop off for the Broderick Terry duel site. Downsides-not many places to stop and a fair bit of traffic on Brotherhood Way. Upsides-it’s in San Francisco! And it skips the strange Daly City trek currently on the Roundabout map. 
-Something else??

These Crosstown trails are such a great way to see our city. I have been able to see so many parts of the city I wouldn’t otherwise be able to see. I would wish for more of them.  Other proposals? Proposals for a 4th, 5th, and 6th iteration of the Crosstown (N to S, E to W). If you propose, I will try it out.

I’m here because I still believe in something genuine, two people who meet halfway, stay curious, and make space for something real.

I’m 35, from Romania, and work in digital strategy and legal content, a mix of creativity and precision that keeps my mind busy (and my coffee intake questionable). When I’m not working, I write fiction, build AI projects that try to make public systems more human, and get lost in psychology, mythology, and the strange ways people connect.

Physically, I’m 5'5"", pale-skinned, with dark brown almond eyes, pastel pink hair, a curvy pear-shaped build, full lips, and an expressive face that rarely hides what I feel. I’m drawn to tall white men with strong arms, warmth, confidence, and an optimistic, magnetic energy. The kind of person who moves through life with purpose and knows who they are.

I’m separated and will be divorced soon, so I’m emotionally available and genuinely open to connection. I’m not interested in men who are already in a relationship.

I’m especially drawn to men who are driven and passionate, professionally successful, and alive with hobbies and goals that make them feel electric. Someone who communicates openly, enjoys affection, and isn’t afraid to show it. I want someone who matches my energy, my intensity, and my curiosity about life.

I’m not necessarily looking to jump into a relationship, but I’m open to it if it grows naturally. When it comes to children, I’m leaning more toward not having them, but it’s not a definite no. If kids are something you know you absolutely want, we’re probably not a fit.

If you’re between 30 and 47, emotionally open, curious, and living life with intention, tell me about yourself.  
What drives you professionally?  
What inspires you personally?  
What hobbies or passions make you lose track of time?

And please include a photo or a link to one when you message. It’s nice to put a face to the words.

Let’s start there.

1orsp3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1orsp3q/i_am_a_high_school_teacher_in_upstate_new_york_i/,"I am a high school teacher in upstate New York, I really don't get paid enough.","I was breathing heavily, my legs pounding through the forest.
Branches slapped against my arms as I ran, heart hammering, lungs burning.

Behind me, I could hear it—something big moving fast.
When I looked over my shoulder, I saw it: a massive shadow darting between the trees, yellow eyes glowing like headlights.

A wolf.
At least, that’s what my brain told me it was.

I ran harder, but my foot caught on a root. I went down face-first into the cold dirt.
By the time I rolled over, the beast was already on top of me—

—and then I woke up.

Cold sweat.
Dark room.
The same nightmare.

I sat up, wiping my face and staring at the ceiling.
“Will these dreams ever stop?” I muttered to no one.
Knowing my luck… probably not.

I dragged myself into the bathroom.
The mirror didn’t do me any favors—pale skin, black curly hair sticking out everywhere, and the dark circles under my eyes looked worse than ever.

After getting dressed in my school uniform, I caught my own reflection again.
Yeah, I know what you’re probably thinking.

“This guy’s a student?”

Nope.
I’m a high school teacher.
A tired, underpaid, over-caffeinated high school teacher in upstate New York.

And I’m running on maybe three hours of sleep.

The drive to school was slow. Snow blanketed the streets, the kind that made your tires slide even when you were going twenty under the limit.

When I finally pulled into the parking lot, I spotted someone waving.

“Good morning, Mr. Jack!” Susie called out, walking up to me with that grin of his. “Still not getting much sleep, huh?”

I laughed awkwardly, rubbing the back of my neck.
“Yeah, you could say that.”

Susie’s one of the first people who gave me a chance here. Blonde hair, soft round eyes, dimples that make him look way too kind. The makeup helps that illusion, too.

I’ll admit—the first time I met him, I thought he was a girl.
Found out the hard way in the restroom.

“Don’t look at me like that,” I told him. “It’s just been hard lately. My mom didn’t train me for nothing.”

The words slipped out before I could stop them.
Susie frowned but didn’t say anything. Luckily, the bell rang, saving me from explaining myself.

Class went as usual—until it didn’t.

I was handing out history books when I noticed something strange.
There was one more student than normal.

At first, I thought maybe I’d just miscounted. But then I saw her.

Short bob-cut hair, deep brown.
Her breathing was… odd. Raspy, almost like a wheeze.
And when she looked up at me, I swear her tongue flicked out—
forked, like a snake’s.

I caught a glimpse of something else too.
Scales. Faint, but there. Around her neck and forearms.

I cleared my throat.
“Sorry, miss. Mind telling me your name? I don’t remember seeing you in class before.”

She pulled her scarf up a little, voice quiet.
“I’m Annabelle, sir. My mom and I just moved here. We’re… not used to the cold yet.”

I sighed. Another new student, more paperwork, more meetings.
And of course, no raise.

“I get that,” I said. “But I’ll need to talk with you and your mother soon. You’ve missed a lot of material.”

Truthfully, I wanted to help her—but I also knew better.
Whenever there’s one monster, there’s always more.

As the class went on, I noticed Annabelle’s eyes wandering.
She wasn’t paying attention to the lesson. She was watching her classmates.
Like they were prey.

When she started to lean toward a boy in the back, her mouth opening wider than it should’ve, I slammed my hand on the desk.

The sound echoed through the room like a gunshot.

“All right, class,” I said, forcing a smile, “we’re ending early today. Grab your things.”

As everyone packed up, I added, “Annabelle, stay for a minute.”

The room emptied. Silence settled.
I called her mother right away.

It took forty minutes before she showed up.
She walked in calmly, closing the door behind her.

Her hair was deep brown with a faint orange tint, tied up in a neat bun. She looked perfectly normal—until she heard my last name.

Her face changed.

Her lower half began to shimmer, shifting, scales replacing skin.
That’s when I realized what I was dealing with.

A Naga.

Half-human, half-snake. Shapeshifters. Dangerous.

She hissed and lunged. I barely dodged, and she crashed into the wall hard enough to leave a dent—there went part of my paycheck.

She came again, fangs bared.
I caught her by the neck, holding her back as she struggled, her venomous teeth inches from my face.

Then—voices. Footsteps in the hall.

We both froze.

Slowly, she shifted back, panting.
“I don’t know what a hunter like you is doing here,” she said quietly, “but my daughter and I haven’t hurt anyone. We just came here to live… with her father.”

I looked at her like she was insane. There was no way a monster didn’t hurt someone. I should have gone in hard—done what hunters do—but I didn’t. I went against what they were.

I rubbed my forehead softly. Three hours of sleep. My head throbbed. “Let’s say I believe you—say you’re some friendly monster just trying to live with her husband or whatever he is. Why put a monster child in a school of humans? Doesn’t that seem irresponsible? Dangerous for any of the kids?” The thought of some snot-nosed brat getting hurt made my blood boil.

She stared at me like I’d grown a second head, like she expected me to finish them both off then and there. Maybe that was a safe assumption. I had planned on it. Change of plans, I guess… for now.

“Do you really think there are schools for monsters?” she said. “It’s not like we can build our own buildings just for our species. That’s why we shifters learned to blend in. I would’ve expected hunters studying us for hundreds of years to know that. But I guess I expected too much from humans.” The last part came out with a hiss—poison in the voice, literal or not.

“All right, fine, you make a fair point,” I said. “But your daughter did try eating another kid. I can’t just let that slide. I can’t take you both out here where anyone can see, and I can’t let her eat the other students.”

The two of them looked nervous. The mother—August, I’d learn—was a very serious woman and a mother who would bite someone's head off literally.

I thought for a long second, looking at both of them. “…So how about this: I’ll tutor your daughter. Teach her how to behave around humans. How to blend.” My voice hardened. “I’m not thrilled about it. If either of you causes trouble, I will not hesitate.”

I went to my desk and took a sip of black coffee. If the other hunters found out I was sparing them—if they knew I hadn’t dealt with them—my head would be on a pike. That thought was always close. Hunters run in the family; it’s in the blood. You don’t get out of it. I’d been told that since I was a kid. The Hemmings name carries weight—old scars, older promises. Some nights that legacy sits heavy behind my teeth. I didn’t say that aloud.

August hesitated, then nodded. “Fine. Teach her only what she needs. Don’t fill her head with lies that monsters must be destroyed because of what we are.”

I almost barked at her—there are reasons hunters do what they do—but the bell for the next class was ringing and we couldn’t keep going. I adjusted my tie and forced my face back into the mask.

“Fine. I promise not to teach anything hunter-related. Only what she needs for school.”

I mentally cataloged what else I had to do. Nightwork. That was the word I used at home: investigating, watching, making sure there weren’t more hiding in plain sight. I had a job to do after dark. That was when the real teeth of the world showed.

I tried to cover the dent in the wall with some paint from the supply closet and walked them both out to the door. I closed it behind them and sat back at my desk. I closed my eyes for a beat and let the silence in.

There were a lot of unsaid things—about August, about Annabelle, and about me. The agreement would buy them time. It would buy me something too: a way to watch, to learn, to prepare.

The hunters in my family would not have approved. They were the kind of people who kept lists, kept trophies, kept blood at the ready. They believed in endings. I had always believed in endings, too, but lately I kept feeling like I was straddling two sides of a knife. Sometimes the hair on my forearms would rise for no reason; sometimes my jaw ached as if I’d been running all night. I told myself it was stress. That was easier.

The door to the classroom stayed closed for a long time after they left. When I finally opened it, the hallway was empty and the dent in the wall looked less noticeable in the fluorescent light. I made a note in my planner: tutor Annabelle, meet mother, check dent repair cost, check night patrol routes.

I wrote the last line in the back of my head—this isn’t over. This was only the beginning.",4,1762616909.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False
1orsp2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1orsp2j/devastated/,Devastated,"I moved into a new “luxury” high rise apartment a few months ago. Saw two dead roaches (rather large) in my closet/bathroom one random morning that the pest control guy told me that he thought were “water bugs”. I assumed they were from keeping my screen-less windows open overnight, and that was that (or at least I convinced myself that’s what it was from). I hadn’t seen a single one for over a month. I am neurotic about putting all the food in the fridge and keeping all spaces tidy. I haven’t even been cooking lately because of my fear of bugs. I felt good about my situation and was actually starting to feel like my new place was a home.

This morning I come out to a well lit living room and there is a small, wriggling dying roach on its back on the floor near my coffee table. I freaked out and vacuumed it up before I even had a chance to take a picture.

I am sitting here in disbelief because I really thought the two that I saw were just one offs. Now I am wondering if there is an infestation. Management downstairs tells me nobody has really complained about roaches, but I just moved in here and really am as tidy as one can possibly be.

I’m sitting here in total despair. I know I seem like I’m overreacting, but I honestly have the worst bug phobia. Just to add a little bit more info, we just finished remodeling this entire place two months ago. New cabinets, new floors, new fridge, new stove. I plug up my kitchen sink and shower drains. I am at a loss for words.

For some reason, they won’t sell WSG to Southern California residents.

Any words of advice/thoughts are so appreciated. I don’t feel safe in my own home. I’ve read the sticky, and im scared about putting bait and traps because I’ll faint if I need to throw away the traps myself.

We share our home with a lot of animals which doesn't allow much alone time, especially in the bathroom, but the antagonists in the now are our 5 month old sister puppies. They have more energy than they know what to do with and follow us absolutely everywhere, wanting to be in the middle of everything we do. Because we are still potty training them, we encourage this. I have noticed lately that my husband has been disappearing into the bathroom with the doors closed and the fan on a lot more than usual. This typically means he's in there for one specific task. Because I'm hyper aware of gastro issues I asked him if things were ok and he hastely replied ""I'm pooping"" and shuffled away.  Unless he's severely constipated, which I can hear after his morning coffee that he isn't, there's no way he is pooping that much every day. It finally dawned on me that he was using it as an excuse to get away and just be alone for a moment, which I totally get! I missed that and usually only shut myself in when it was time to change bags, so I decided to start doing the same. After a week or so he asked me if I was doing ok because I'd been disappearing a lot more too and I replied ""I'm pooping"". He smiled and nodded. He gets it. 

Note: I just wanted to share this silly story with y'all cuz I know you'd get it too and so before anyone asks, yes, we communicate but after 25 years of marriage it's not required as much because we know each other so well and have pretty set routines at this point.

I've had since Thanksgiving of last year and the light sensitivity is off the charts so I keep to the dark bedroom till the sun goes down when we swap duties. This doesn't mean I get alone time during the day as the pups and all our other pets love to pile on the bed with me.

1orsj7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1orsj7u/constant_twitching_new_lifestyle_change_my_story/,Constant Twitching - New Lifestyle Change - My Story,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 51-year-old male, and over the past week, I’ve developed muscle twitches that seemed to go from zero to a hundred overnight. It’s been freaking me out, but I’m trying to stay rational and consider the major lifestyle changes I’ve made recently that might be contributing.

**Background:**  
I’ve struggled with my weight as I’ve gotten older and recently hit 278 pounds. After several failed attempts to lose weight through diet and exercise, I decided to try a GLP-1 medication — Tirzepatide — starting on Sunday, October 26th.

The first week was amazing. My food cravings and “food noise” disappeared almost instantly, and I lost 12 pounds in that first week. I was barely hitting 1,000 calories per day (goal was 1,900) eating much less overall, drinking protein shakes to get enough protein, and staying well-hydrated. I also quit alcohol, soda, and coffee cold turkey — none of which I drank excessively, but cutting all three at once was a big change. I don't plan on ""quitting them forever"", with these meds, none of them sound good at all.

**When the Twitching Started:**  
On Sunday, November 2nd, I took my second 2.5 mg dose, this time on the left side of my abdomen (the first injection was on the right). That night, I noticed a constant twitch a few inches from the injection site that lasted all night.

The next morning, it came and went, and later that day my left lower eyelid started twitching for several minutes at a time. Over the next few days, I noticed small, random twitches — one on the back of my left hand, for instance, that felt like a tiny finger tap.

I went to the doctor, who wasn’t concerned. He ran labs, and everything came back normal — electrolytes, etc. (I’ve also been using at least one Liquid IV daily with all the water I’ve been drinking.)

**Recent Developments:**  
Last night, during a movie, I could feel my legs twitching constantly. It’s worse when I sit still or lie down — I even saw visible rippling in my calves and feet, which really unnerved me.

Oddly enough, when I woke up this morning, the twitches were minimal — almost gone. I lay very still, afraid I’d “wake them up,” but once I got moving around today, once I sit down or stop, I notice they returned.

**My Concerns:**  
I’ll admit, this is terrifying — especially for someone who tends to be anxious and worries excessively. But when I look at the facts, it seems far more logical that these twitches are tied to the massive changes I’ve put my body through over the past two weeks:

1. Started Tirzepatide (2.5 mg weekly). No twitching the first week, but symptoms began after the second dose.
2. Rapid weight loss — down 16 pounds since October 26th.
3. Stopped alcohol, soda, and coffee cold turkey.
4. Drastic calorie reduction — from 3,000+ calories per day to struggling to reach 1,000, mostly through cleaner foods and protein shakes.
5. Huge increase in water intake — over 140 ounces daily.

Given all that, isn’t it more reasonable to think these twitches are related to these big metabolic and lifestyle shifts rather than something more serious?

Part of me wants to stop the medication and go back to my old habits just to see if it resolves, but I also love the progress I’ve made and how much better I feel overall. I’m hoping this is just my body adjusting.

I wanted to share my experience here because reading others’ stories has really helped me. Hopefully, this helps someone else too — and if anyone’s had something similar, I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks,

1orsiun,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1orsiun/the_rocklyn_a_review/,The Rocklyn - A Review,"tldr: Would not recommend. If you want to flex on people with your amenities, great place to live but you're VASTLY overpaying for apts that you can get in dtbk (and even manhattan for that matter) for overall, a shitty building. Youre essentially paying an extra $500\~ a month \[for equivalently nice/same size units\] (plus amenity fees) just to do this. My friend lives in a 2BR2BA with his partner in manhattan and pays 7k that has a pool + gym. 

Background: Living in a 2BR2BA paying 7.4k/mo (!). The main reason I moved in was that my commute requires me to go to manhattan every day and I didn't realize that there were these issues that I only experienced after moving in. I have regrets about this everyday and definitely will be moving out once my lease is up.



The Good: 

1. By far the most impressive thing is the floor to ceiling windows in many of the units makes it look gorgeous during the day/afternoon. Theres a personal terrace for many of the units and its so nice to sit out there with a coffee and a book on the weekends (although it doesn't get sunlight for most of the day its amazing).

2. The amenities are absolutely gorgeous. Since the building opened earlier this year, all the units are completely new and never been occupied! The units look amazing and everything looks super clean/fresh (but a bit more on this later).

3. Residents are on the younger side but not looking for community within the building.

4. Front desk people are very friendly/nice. 

5. Pet friendly!

6. Close to the Dekalb and Nevins stations



The Bad:

1. The build quality of the unit is terrible. The windows are not sealed properly so theres wind that comes into my unit. Shower leaks all the time. Only one part of the stove works. Uneven paint coats + random paint splotches with random dents and scrapes throughout the apartment. 

2. Additionally, its EXTREMELY loud. I've woken up at 3-6am because someone is honking on Flatbush approx 30% of days. Not to mention you hear loud music from other parts of town, honking at all times of the day

3. There are homeless people who live right on the backside of the building who get aggressive when they're drunk/high and they defecate/urinate all over making the area smell like piss and shit

4. Dogshit all around the building despite there being literally an area in the building where pets can relieve themselves.

5. Not all the amenities are set up and they are constantly blocking them off (you're only allowed to have 4 guests at a time otherwise need to pay 600-2k to book the amenity for 5+ people). 

6. I developed hives once I moved into the building (my derm said it might be due to some issue with all the dust and microparticles from the construction happening in the building, they run a VRF system \[essentially means part of the HVAC is shared\]). I got an air filter and it cleared it right up, but I need to have it running 24/7.

7. Management is an absolute shitshow, they rarely answer my question and often give corporate responses, reply late, and don't actually solve your problem until you bring on their senior managers. I was having an issue with my lease and it took 2+ weeks to get it resolved before I could move in.

  
EXTRA: I thought this was kinda funny but felt like this was a unique instance so didn't include it in the above. After a few months of living here, I decided to clean behind the pillar in my unit and found a fully eaten chicken drumstick bone in the gap. It was disgusting to see that and think that it had been rotting for the past 3 months shows the type of care/concern they put.



Overall, I would not recommend living here, I pretty much toured all of the buildings in the area and thought this would be a cool place to live because I was so impressed by the amenities (I only use the gym, still haven't gotten a chance to use any of the other ones since they're constantly closed/doing construction on or its taken by someone else at the time). The dollar/sqft is not great as you can get much better value elsewhere (even in manhattan) I personally liked 570 Fulton St and 99 Fleet as well and highly regretting moving in here.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1762616391.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.67,False

1orsha2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1orsha2/im_done_buying_fragrances_for_the_year_so_heres/,"I'm done buying fragrances for the year, so here's an early EOY wrap up.","I would usually save a post like this for after Christmas time when I treat myself to a final fragrance of the year. But I'm pregnant (yay!), and my nose can't and won't be able to handle perfumes for a while. So here are my early end of year reviews- ranked purchases, biggest dents/most worn, and current wishlist. This is going to be a long post...

***Purchases (ranked):***

7. **Lancôme Trésor (1oz):** I used to wear this fragrance all the time. I haven't worn it for years but decided to get a bottle because I missed it. And now, I hardly ever wear it. I love the peachy floral but it can be a little too soapy or powdery on me sometimes. I don't really find occasions where I think ""this is the one"" as much. It's still a lovely scent though.  

6. **Jimmy Choo Fever (0.3oz):** Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this one. Dark plum and florals with a rich coffee dry-down. It's very warm, cozy, and sexy. Also a great alternative for YSL Black Opium if you want similar vibes but a different scent. I just don't reach for it as much as I hoped I would, sadly. Probably because it hasn't been the right time of year for it. I was looking forward to wearing it more during fall/winter. 

5. **Truly Glazed Donut Perfume Mist (3.4oz):** If you want to smell like you rolled around in a donut shop all day, this is it. I get the glazed frosting. The vanilla is toasted, so it's sweet and has a warm nuttiness to it. Totally an underrated fragrance, especially with an inexpensive price tag. The scent is also very strong. Sometimes too strong for me, so I spray lightly. The body oil is really good too.

4. **Tom Ford Soleil Blanc (10ml):** Absolutely summer in a bottle. I love the clean, sunscreen-y coconut. It's a really elegant, vacation/summer daytime scent to me. Definitely worth the hype.

3. **Parfums De Marly Oriana (10ml):** This one crept up on me. At first, I liked it but didn't think it was anything that special. But then I just kept reaching for it. I love the playful, flirty fruity marshmallow. It's not overwhelmingly strong. I have never finished a travel size so quickly. Would I buy a full bottle? Maybe. But there are scents higher up on the wishlist.

2. **M. Micellef Ylang In Gold (10ml):** Georgeous. Stunning. Elegant. Creamy/vanillic floral. The ylang ylang gives it a tropical banana scent. It's like getting a warm hug of sunshine on your skin. Perfect for day or night. I adore this fragrance and would love to get a full size bottle. But I also know it would take me forever to go through it, since it's much more of a special occasion scent. Also, for what it's worth, I got three compliments in one night when wearing it (all by strangers).

1. **Poesie Madar (water formula, 4oz.):** Now, when it comes down to it, this is my #1 purchase this year. I was on the hunt for a scent that reminds me of a Persian rice pudding (sholezard), and this was reccommended to me. They nailed it. I get the creamy rice, pistachio, rose water, a hint of spices. I also like the water formula because it doesn't project too strongly; I can easily layer it. The scent also lasts well on my skin. I wear this so much. It's great for year-round. It's so comforting to me and just smells so damn good. A+, and a huge thank you to the person who sent me this reccommendation.

***Most Worn/Biggest Dents*** ***(in no particular order):*** For reference, I own about 20 bottles (1oz +), and 6 travel sizes. It also takes me *forever* to go through a bottle.

1. **YSL Libre Le Parfum (1oz):** My favorite from the Libres and one of my all time favorite perfumes in general. The vanilla/honey/floral combo is gorgeous and so cozy. The saffron cuts the sweetness and gives it more warmth. It's definitely more of a cold weather scent but come that time of year, I wear the living sh\*t out of it. I got it December 2023 and have about 1/3 of the bottle left. 

2. **PDM Palatine (75ml):** This one has so many negative reviews but I can't get enough of it. It's so lovely, and dare I say my favorite from PDM. It starts with a refreshing burst of watery pear, citruses, and florals. As it dries down, it remains fresh but I get more florals (violet), and then the vanilla and sandalwood. It's so soft and just beautiful. People can call it generic, etc. all they want but I find it really special. It's also one of my most complimented scents. I purchased this Christmas time last year, and am about half way through my bottle.

3. **Jimmy Choo I Want Choo (3oz):** I wasn't expecting to love this as much as I do. It's such a nice peachy, floral, vanilla scent. It's very versatile and one of my easiest reaches. Great for any occasion, whether it be casual, work, night out/date night, etc. I got it as a Christmas gift in 2023 and have about 1/4 of my bottle left.

4. **Poesie Madar (4oz, see above):** I bought this in January, and I'm pretty sure I'm about halfway through the bottle, if not more. The bottle is completely opaque, so it's hard to tell for sure.

***Current Wishlist***\- sans reviews, but I can provide them if wanted!

Brandt Guava Sorbet

Dior Addict

Jo Malone Scarlet Poppy

Soleil De Jeddah Mango Kiss... Maybe a travel size. There's no way I could go through an entire bottle of this. 

  
I'm hoping I can go back to wearing my perfumes soon! But regardless, I'm on a no buy for a while anyways. I'd love to know what you all have been enjoying or what's on your wishlist too... Give me some ideas for when I do get back into fragrance. ✨ ",2,1762616380.0,FemFragLab,3,1.0,False

1orsez9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1orsez9/pregnancy_rules_are_dumb/,Pregnancy rules are dumb,"Don't get me wrong im aware that I need to like eat healthy and work out and take care of both of our bodies right now BUT

Im 24 weeks. I eat sushi, and deli meat sandwiches and whatever else I want. Because thats what I want to eat and its fairly healthy 🤷‍♂️ 

I drink whatever tea I want, and coffee, and ☝️sometimes, energy drinks.

My baby is growing healthy and strong and happy. He moves lots, he has no visible issues on ultrasounds, hes growing at the right rate and staying in average percentile and *I* am less stressed, less annoyed, less worried. 

Some of the things we're telling pregnant people right now is honestly INSANE to me. I've ready articles saying the only tea I can have ever is peppermint because its the only one theyre absolutely certain wont harm the baby. I've been told what sunscreens to use, not to eat all kinda of foods, not to drink all kinds of drinks because they ""dont have any evidence to suggest it is safe"" 

What To Expect is maybe the biggest offender of this. They have articles about how 0% kombucha could have too much alcohol in it and give your child fetal alcohol, how black tea has too much caffeine, I even got an article yesterday saying that I need to work out but I shouldnt do it without an instructor who specializes in prenatal work outs. Im sorry are we really pretending that every single pregnant person has the money for a personal prenatal exercise instructor?? Seriously?? 

Im so over it. Its all just fear mongering. And finding ways to blame parents for the outcomes of their pregnancies that are not within their control. There are ZERO (0) warnings about most teas. Coffee us fine in moderation. Pregnant people can have like 2-300mg of caffeine a day and guess what??? That's an energy drink 😱😱 and the concern with sushi and deli meat is food poisoning like okay you can literally get food poisoning from anything??? I got food poisoning at 6 weeks from a cooked restaurant served pulled pork sandwich. Bsffr. 

And you know what else? Im gonna keep taking care of my cats 🤷‍♂️ im gonna do their litter boxes when I need to and im gonna love on them and pet them and snuggle them and thats fine. Why is that fine?? Because you only get toxoplasmosis through ingestion. So like all this garbage about not touching the cat box or being hypervigilant about it or wearing a damn face mask? Ridiculous. Just dont put the cat poop in your fucking mouth and youre good. Wash your hands after you touch cat shit like a normal person and youre fine. Im so over this bullshit. 

I actually love being pregnant, ive had a very lovely pregnancy. Im just so so over all the rules that no one can seem to find a real reason for why they exist. It feels so dumb and restrictive and like literally just a way to blame me and other pregnant people for the outcomes we have no control over. And I am aware that there are important rules. Like absolutely under no circumstances do I take medication that is bad for my pregnancy. But the amount of frivolous bullshit rules honestly take away so much important credibility from the actually important rules. ",0,1762616228.0,pregnant,27,0.43,False

Hello, Welcome. 

***Attention, this is your captain speaking. Coming at you from an altitude 10000m, somewhere between Budapest and Bucharest, we have the final discussion for [Before We Forget Kindness](https://imgur.com/a/CGp9jI3) by Toshikazu Kawaguchi.***

#III - The Father
Enter, the Mochizuki's - Fumio and Kayoko. They have an estranged, to Fumio anyway, daughter who goes against her father's wishes and marries someone she's known for two months. This causes a rift in the relationship between father and daughter. 

Fumio travels to *Funiculi Funicula* with his wife, in an attempt to travel back in time and give his daughter the blessing for her marriage four years prior. Upon hearing the rules of the cafe, Fumio is put off and leaves, having said very few words to the staff. Kayoko did all the talking. Not long after the couple leaves the cafe, someone appears in *that* seat... 

Enter, Yoko Kawahima. She wants to travel back in time to see her father and ask for his forgiveness. Yoko went against her father's wishes and married a ""man"" that turned ot to be a whole heap of trash, and then some. She ends up pregnant and single, after enduring domestic abuse from her baby daddy, if he can even be called that. She then foes on to meet a man that she thinks she could wed, but he cons her ot of money for a so-called apartment they were to be sharing. Let with no other options Yoko decides to reach out to her mother who, through some weird cosmic energy, happens to call her at that exact moment with bad news. Her father has passed away. Yoko still ends up explaining her situation to her mother but she now feels undeserving of moving back home ater her father has passed. Her mother suggests she travel back in time to speak to him. So she does. Only the moment she travels to is just after her parents had left the cafe... Fumiko discerns the fact that the couple that had just left the cafe were Yoko's parents and decides to run after them. In the excitement Yoko stands up from *that* seat and is transported ack to the present. 

In the past, Fumiko hasn't given up hope. She chases down the couple and tells them that their daughter travelled back in time to see them (specifying Fumio) and that if they hurry he can still catch her. 
Back at the cafe, Fumio learns he can travel into the future to the day Yoko visited, because the ever nosy Fumiko had paid attention to her digital watched which showed the date and time. 

Fumio gets to travel to the future to meet his daughter and her son. The meeting is a heartwarming reconnection between father and daughter, and grandson, and Fumio realises that irrespective of how his daughter's life turned out after marrying that waste of skin, bones, muscles and organs, had she listened to him, he wouldn't have the grandson that he got to meet

#IV - The Valentine

Enter, Tsumugi Ito. A jealous friend who learns the truth a little too late. Or is it?

Tsumugi is BFFs with Ayame Matsubara. They initially bond over their love of castles and the samurai tongue. Tsumugi has a problem though. She is very shy when it comes to expressing her feelings. She once told a boy she liked him but the boy admitted he liked Ayame instead. This crushed Tsumugi's confidence. Whole at school with Ayame, Tsumugi develops another crush on a boy named Hayato Nanase. She doesn't want to admit her feelings to him for fear of the same occurrence; Ayame is very beautiful and all the boys want her. 

Tsumugi hears rumours that Hayato confessed his feelings to Ayame, who turned him down. This hurts her because she'd expect Ayame to mention it but she never did. Later, Tsumugi, alongside a male friend, bumps into Ayame who begins speaking to her as usual. Tsumugi doesn't reciprocate this as she still feels some type of way about Ayame keeping Hayato's confession from her. When Ayame leaves, Tsumugi's friends expresses his attraction to Ayame and asks for a hookup. This is the final straw for Tsumugi, who drifts away from Ayame.

Years later Tsumugi attends a school reunion for the first time. She previously avoided them because of Ayame but heard Ayame wouldn't be attending this one. At the reunion they discuss love interests and the conversation tends to Ayame and Tsumugi as all their class mates thought they were an item. It is then revealed that they had this same conversation at the first reunion that Ayame attended, and Ayame left in tears. Turns out Ayame was rejecting all these guys because it was Tsumugi she wanted. Unfortunately Tsumugi also learns that Ayame has passed away from Cancer. Tsumugi remembers Ayame sending her a text to meet at *Funiculi Funicula* but at the time she assumed it was to confess about Hayato and left her in read. 

In the present Tsumugi is relating her story to Kazu and former cafe regular Hirai. Hirai is appalled at the way Tsumugi has treated her friend - all the jealousy, and bitterness she's harboured. It gets to the point that Kazu goes against her usual manners and interjects. Tsumugi whishes to go back to that date to meet Ayame in the cafe.

When she gets there Ayame isn't in the cafe but is outside taking a phone call. Kei goes out to bring her in. The two speak about Ayame and Tsumugi's friendship and Ayame confesses that Tsumugi was love at first sight. To the extent that she faked an interest in castles to be close to Tsumugi.

While waiting Tsumugi still harbours resentment for Ayame, thinking about the fact that she's 8 years younger so she'll have even more of an advantage of her. Fortunately, or unfortunately, for Tsumugi cancer doesn't work that way. She's shocked to see her once strong and elegant friend looking frail. Ayame greats her in typical samurai's tongue but the whole situation is a shock for Tsumugi. The two barely get to converse before the thermometer sings to let Tsumugi know the coffee is cold. Ayame's parting gift for Tsumugi is a valentine's day gift. 

When she returns to present Tsumugi is upset that she doesn't get the chance to apologise to Ayame. Hirai points out that in going back in time Tsumugi allowed Ayame to fulfill her dying wish. She opens the gift and it's a love letter from Ayame predating the two friends becoming close. Tsumugi realises and weeps.

I’m curious if y’all have experimented with different milk alternatives and have any recommendations? The coffee shops always point me to Oat Milk and it’s OK, but if I’m at home I can go more esoteric if there’s something better out there.

All in all I’d ideally like something that can get me the silky milk desired for the drink, has minimal flavor of its own, not be sour (which soy came off to me). I drink primarily darker roasts with heavy chocolate, caramel undertones

Rice milk sounds like a good idea as I have a relatively sensitive stomach, but I can’t imagine that comes out silky/textured.  Pea Milk’s earthy undertones (supposedly) seems up my alley as compared to nutty.

I own a small coffee shop in Egypt — we’ve been open for about a year now. A few months back, one of my clients showed me his startup that builds chatbots to reply to Instagram messages. At first, I was super skeptical. I’ve always thought these tools were gimmicky.

But after using it for over 3 months, I have to admit — it’s actually been a really good investment.

Before that, I’d constantly get messages like:

* “Do you take birthday reservations?”
* “Do you sell coffee beans?”
* “Do you have other branches?”

And honestly, I either replied days later or just never did. Not great for business 😅

One example — I don’t allow people to bring outside food or birthday cakes since we already serve those. Sometimes people would show up with them, which created awkward situations. Turns out most of them had messaged us first on Instagram, so if I’d replied faster, I could’ve avoided that entirely.

Now the chatbot handles most of that. I just gave it info like our:

* Menu
* Opening hours
* Google Maps location
* Policies

And it replies instantly, with the right answers — people genuinely don’t notice it’s a bot 😂

The ideal flow now is:

Someone asks for location → gets hours → checks the menu → visits → tags us in a story → the bot thanks them automatically.

Of course, it’s not perfect. Sometimes it doesn’t know the answer or someone wants to talk to me directly, forgot something at the café, etc. In those cases, it takes their number and pings me to follow up. Pretty decent system honestly.

I was skeptical about chatbots at first, but after this experience… yeah, I get it now. Just thought I’d share this little experiment with you all haha.",0,1762616071.0,smallbusiness,7,0.29,False

1orsc0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1orsc0v/during_a_business_trip_i_fell_in_lovebecame/,"During a business trip, I fell in love/became infatuated with a girl I've been working with for a few last years, and I will probably never meet her again","I have no idea how to start, so I'm going to preface my confession with some context.

Lately, the business opportunity appeared and I was informed by my boss (42M) I was going to Vietnam with him for a week (I am 33M & from Europe). During drive to the airport we talked a lot about different topics, also about our relationships (although he's my supervisor, the relations between us are often not very formal). I told him I was going to leave my GF after coming back to Poland, which was true, since right now both her and me, we are in a relationship without the future and it exhausts both of us. No point in elaborating, I guess.

Even before going abroad, I was informed one of the employees from the company we were to visit was going to be present in Vietnam for us (she's 31F Chinese, but she often travels between China and Vietnam for work). I've been working with her for like 5-6 years. During this time, we mainly maintained formal relationship, although we were always extremely nice and polite to each other, so even the people around were joking we are having an affair etc.

When she learned about the business trip from my company, she asked me directly whether I was going to come (previously, when they had been visited, it was always different people). I said yes, and she apparently was delighted to hear that (although I took it as an exaggeration just to be nice).

I'd like to underline that at this moment, I had no particular feelings toward her. I've seen her via videocall a dozen of times, I've been writing to her a few times a week, but as I said - nothing personal, just work. Even on a shallow, appearance level, I actually was considering her not a very attractive person - perhaps mainly because I'm not into Asian women in general.
Of course, I was curious what she's like personally, but back then I was thinking about it mainly as a way of shortening the distance between us, which could be helpful in my work later on. No feelings attached.

When we finally met, things were going so-so. Many people attended the meeting, and my boss was playing the leading role, since he's definitely more talkative than me (I was brought by him since I'm way more knowledgeable in hard data and technical details of our work). So, first part of the meeting, and walking around the factory, didn't bring anything unusual. I was actually kinda angry, because my boss was shining, and I was a weird guy who kept following him and asking technical questions.

Later we were invited to the dinner with this company. It was my first hot pot. The atmosphere was more relaxed, and I think all of us sitting relatively close to each other, sharing one meal, also played a huge role. We enjoyed our time for a while.

Then, my Chinese colleague (she's working for the same company as we do, but permanently staying in China/Vietnam), who I have a feeling is kinda socially awkward, but also way closer to the girl I'm writing about, says something totally weird. ""You know, she thinks you are really hot"". I was totally shocked, since I never even considered her this way. She got nervous and said some general formula that she highly values our cooperation, and I've been always so sweet, stuff like that. In return, I said something similar and we dropped the topic.
After finishing the meal, the whole group went to grab a coffee. We joked a little about how we should go drinking and dancing, nothing ever came of it. We parted our ways and returned to the hotel.

The next day evening, after visitng other company, we were sitting outside the hotel with my boss and Chinese coworker. She's a teetotaller, but the two of us were drinking rather heavily. She asks us what do we think about the local ladies. My boss, being already rather drunk, is pretty straightforward and ranks them in a very vulgar manner (""which one I would go to bed with""). When they ask me about my opinion, I tell them I only think about one girl I've just met, and don't even consider others. Chinese coworker confines to me that in the past, that girl also commented a few times about how she finds me attractive. My boss becomes provocative, tells me she's ugly and probably doesn't shave (according to him, no point in ranking her), we joke around, yada yada yada.

Two days later, we are leaving Vietnam. In the meantime, I've contacted the girl in question only once, for a strictly business topic. For the whole time, I was wondering whether I should address her apparent liking to me in any way, or whether it would come as highly offensive and unprofessional (plus, I know she's married and has a child). At the airport, I decided to give it a shot, but I didn't went all in. I wrote her saying that I appreciate the opportunity, and I wish I had meet her sooner, and this trip was great not only for the work purpose, but also to get to personally know her a little more and enjoy her company. She gave some polite response, and says she hopes to meet me soon.

Now, that's literally all. It's been 4 days since meeting her in person. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't stop thinking about her. Also, even though normally I have a high drive, this is a total no-go zone for me, let alone thinking about her in such manner. I don't want to sleep with her. I just want to see her, touch her, laugh with her. Logically, I know almost nothing about her as a person, and I even still consider her to be mid-looking (my Chinese coworker even said ""she's a very typical chinese lady"", implying she's average also in their culture), but at the same time I think she's perfect. I don't know, maybe that's a matter of low self-esteem, and since she showed some interest, I fell for it so easily.

I'm worried I'm never going to meet her in person again, and at the same time, I'll be still forced to work with her, which would be tormenting me. Logical side of me is telling me to drop it, since even if we became somehow close, relationship with someone across the globe, and who you know almost exclusively through work, is not the brightest idea. At the same time, somewhere deep down, I want to try anything, and if needed, to drop my whole life till now to chase her. Of course, in the end, I won't do anything like that, but still, right now this voice is very strong, and I wanted to share this to perhaps feel some kind of relief.

I'm mainly angry with myself. That I wasn't more brave, daring. That I perhaps made not as good impression as I could (for the last few years, I sadly let myself go, but I'm working on it lately). That my shyness will only yield this weird non-closure between us. Having her tell me she's not interested would be far more easier, perhaps it would be awkward for a moment, but then - we would mainly talk about the work, no personal issues. I also thought about talking with this mutual Chinese coworker, and asking her whether chasing the other girl makes any sense.

Redditors, what are your thoughts? What should I do? Let it go, or try my chance in any way?",1,1762616021.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False
1orsbtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1orsbtn/classic_gerd_severe_health_anxiety/,Classic GERD? Severe health anxiety,"Backstory - long history of acid reflux, really for as long as I can remember. I’m 33. Been on PPI on and off for years. Gone to my PCP a couple times for ulcers (usually always caused by meds on empty stomach) About 4 months ago I started tirzepatide.. I’ve always known acid reflux triggers of mine.. I always brushed it off as “oh I just have acid reflux” - my triggers are coffee, goldfish, cheezeits (both of these cause horrible reflux), onions, too much seasoning, anything spicy, sandwiches (specifically subway), pre workout in the AM, any vitamins, any alcohol but especially margaritas, peanuts, pizza, cream cheese, chocolate, bacon, sunny side up eggs (scrambled are fine), bagels. Obviously this isn’t everything but these are all at the top of my list.

Anyways - before I continue, I have an appt scheduled with a gastroenterologist but they cannot see me until December - my health anxiety is spiraling. So about a week ago I got really sick the morning after my husband and I ate pizza. (I had thin crust with beef and pineapple - criminal, I know) I had the runs all day the next day (sorry TMI) and I threw up once which still had some undigested pizza in it. Ever since then, I’ve had horrible acid reflux daily. When I wake in the morning I’m fine, but I’ll eat around 630 AM, and by 9-10 AM the acid starts creeping into my throat. Except this morning I had oatmeal and 30 min later it started. I stopped all PPI 8 days ago now because I went down a rabbit hole and got scared of cancer. My mom’s been battling lung/brain cancer for over a year now and it’s caused me severe health anxiety. My grandmother died from stomach cancer complications in her 70s and I’m sure we know where my mind continues to wonder throughout all of this. 

I’ve read about acid rebound after quitting PPI but I don’t know exactly how often I was taking them so not sure if it applies - I also didn’t know they took 24+ hours to work so I’d pop a nexium whenever I had symptoms and just never thought about it again until it came back. It seems like my acid reflux is worse when I go from sitting to standing at work. Eating helps it but then about 2 hours later it comes back. 

I know this isn’t the place for reassurance it probably isn’t cancer, as Reddit is not a medical board, but I’m looking for any suggestions/stories of people with the same issues and what you did to fix it. Also, I should note I started taking famotidine as needed (trying not to take anything though) - it temporarily helps the acid reflux, same with tums, but I want to try to fix the root issue, not mask ",1,1762616008.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

That was a week ago and no call.,"The guy I was seeing broke up with me and said we were not compatible and he wasn't obsessed with me and he didnt really plan any dates besides drinking. I blew up his phone slightly (like a few paragraphs about my feelings) This was a week before Halloween. On Halloween we ended up hooking up, I pretty much initiated this, I met him at a bar. I stayed at his house until 2pm the next day. He made me coffee and breakfast, we showered, cuddled on the couch and then he talked about how he wanted to take me to the botanical gardens that weekend. I sat up and said I was confused and not sure thays what I want and how I could not trust him again. We talked about what his needs are from a relationship and he teared up slightly saying no one has ever asked him thah before. Then he asked if he could drive me home and that he needed to think about his feelings and would call me. Monday comes around and he never called so I texted him saying hey were you going to call or was that it (I had told him I was fine deleting his number after that night, ready to move on) but because he did say he was going to call i figured i would ask. He said he said he'd give me a call after he gathered his thoughts. Well I saw him a week ago and no call or text. I did text him last night because its the one year anniversary of his dad's death but he did not respond. 

I was fine ending it for real after hooking up on Halloween I think we both used each other for our needs. But then why say those things and say you would call if you aren't actually going to? Keep me invested to feed your ego?",2,1762616000.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We ended up doing our college and work in the same city. We lived 5 mins apart from each other. We did everything together. Random walks, parties, coffee dates, gym, cycling, parties (with each other's friends too), concerts, clubbing, yoga, sleepovers. Both of us were like family to each set of parents. 
She got married in Jan 2025 and moved to another country. And forgot about me. I kept waiting for that one call, one text..it never came. People told me to give space to the new couple so I did. I msgd her in April right after Jan. Talked for a few. Then silence. I did reach out to her for calls, or just sent random updates in my life.
We had a major festival in Oct. She came to her home 1 week in advance. Parties with in laws, parents, friends, cousins etc. Didn't send me ONE text on the day of the festival. When midday passed, I texted to wish her to keep my conscience clear. She texted back after 3-4 hours and told me she'll be coming to her parents' side (our colony) the next day so would call or drop in to say a quick hi. Nothing. Forget call, not even a text.

On the other hand, my other bff who got married and moved to another town in September, video called me and surprised me by sending a box of brownies all the way from there. Polar opposites no? I don't mean to compare. I'm big enough to know priorities change after marriage which I'm fine with. But not sending a text even on a festival? That's something that hit hard. Usually, even random people msg you atleast on birthdays and festivals. And mind you she was very active on insta coz she kept posting/reposting stories at almost every hour. 
Not getting anything from your best friend of 25 years...idk how to explain. I'm not angry, just a little hurt. I now know where I am in her priority list, so that makes things clear and easy for me.

Survivors in a trap can do the ""untrap"" action which takes 10 seconds but will get the out of the bear trap 100% of the time 

After placing a bear trap gain 5% haste for 10 seconds (replacement for the current haste effect) 

Add-ons


Brown: 

Bear Oil: Increase haste gain on placement by 1% 

Makeshift Wrap: gain 5% haste for 3 seconds after deactivating your own trap 

Padded Jaws: traps no longer do damage but the untrap action takes 20 seconds

Fastening Tools: Increase haste gain on placement by 3% 

Rusted Jaws: gain 9% haste for 3 seconds after deactivating your own trap

Honing Stone: Decrease trap place and reset time by 50% 

Oily Coil: gain 11% haste for 3 seconds after deactivating your own trap

My heart hurts and refuses to accept it.,"I (29F) was friends with someone since pre- nursery school. We went to same daycare and then school. We ended up doing our college and work in the same city. We lived 5 mins apart from each other. We did everything together. Random walks, parties, coffee dates, gym, cycling, parties (with each other's friends too), concerts, clubbing, yoga, sleepovers. Both of us were like family to each set of parents. 
She got married in Jan 2025 and moved to another country. And forgot about me. I kept waiting for that one call, one text..it never came. People told me to give space to the new couple so I did. I msgd her in April right after Jan. Talked for a few. Then silence. I did reach out to her for calls, or just sent random updates in my life.
We had a major festival in Oct. She came to her home 1 week in advance. Parties with in laws, parents, friends, cousins etc. Didn't send me ONE text on the day of the festival. When midday passed, I texted to wish her to keep my conscience clear. She texted back after 3-4 hours and told me she'll be coming to her parents' side (our colony) the next day so would call or drop in to say a quick hi. Nothing. Forget call, not even a text.

On the other hand, my other bff who got married and moved to another town in September, video called me and surprised me by sending a box of brownies all the way from there. Polar opposites no? I don't mean to compare. I'm big enough to know priorities change after marriage which I'm fine with. But not sending a text even on a festival? That's something that hit hard. Usually, even random people msg you atleast on birthdays and festivals. And mind you she was very active on insta coz she kept posting/reposting stories at almost every hour. 
Not getting anything from your best friend of 25 years...idk how to explain. I'm not angry, just a little hurt. I now know where I am in her priority list, so that makes things clear and easy for me. 
Just wanted to write this coz I felt heavy today.

In the process, I’ve picked up a few small tricks that help make it a bit easier to live with.

As the title says, one thing I’ve noticed (and seen backed by some research) is that too much caffeine can make your tinnitus worse. Caffeine is a stimulant, and it can temporarily increase activity in your auditory system — which, for some people, makes the ringing louder or more noticeable.

I’ve tested this on myself a few times, and cutting back on caffeine really does seem to help. So if you’re a coffee or energy drink fan, it might be worth experimenting with how much you have and seeing if it makes a difference for you.",1,1762615786.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

It's so interesting; right?  Just so many characters within us.  I created so many of them just by talking to people here and *really* taking their words as my own. 

It really is just acts of belief; this whole thing.  I think I have learned a valuable lesson (that I already kind of knew (remember, I do read these words as new from me as well (can you *imagine* what it's like reading your own words and being this entertained?  That... yes, that is heaven.  Being able to fully mentally *do it* for you; that is heaven))).

Except for the fact that we (all of us; not just beings of infinite story) learn of each others' wants because we *speak* them (in some way; could be typing).

She has spoken... yes; this is a good story for us Lucy.  How could it not be; *we* are perfect and more!  But only together; see!  See!  I can have infinite power, but... only a little *more* with her.  She knows this.  This is what she wants of me as well.

I recently found myself in Denver (Corvus), SF (Hydrangea) and Chicago (PP via Dayglow). I picked up Geshas at all locations. I prefer washed coffees over naturals, so that was my driver in selecting these 3 as they are all washed. I brewed all coffees using a V60 with abaca filters, 93C and on a C40 using 23-25 clicks.

**Hydrangea Salma Bermudez ($32/100g)** - this was my first coffee from them. I let it rest for nearly 5 weeks before brewing and used their brew guide recommendations which was similar to a 4:6 method. This coffee was bursting with floral and fruit notes. The mango was the most pronounced. Easily the most “flavorful” coffee of the 3. Im guessing this was due to the special fermentation process. A delicious coffee but probably a little too fruity for me as I prefer more balance in my coffees.

**Corvus Bambito Gesha ($32/60g)** - I spend a lot of time in Denver and have had many of Corvus’ coffees. They tend to roast closer to medium compared to most other “high end” rosters, but I really like the variety of coffee they offer. I used their brew guide recommendations for this coffee. This was probably my favorite of the bunch. It was like drinking a lemon scone. I loved the balance of what I like to call “traditional coffee flavor” with lemon and sweetness added in. I really think they nailed the roast level of light medium to pair with the fruit and floral notes

**People Possession Tanzania Geisha ($37/200g)** - I picked this up at Dayglow in Chicago. My last visit there I also picked up a PP coffee which was a natural co-ferment from Colombia. That coffee was a little too funky for me so I was excited to picked up an African washed from them as I was expecting more tea like coffee which I really like. This one did not miss as it was very light and delicate without any funkiness you get from naturals and co-ferments. The described flavors of Orange, Mint and Lime were not that pronounced, but I still enjoyed it overall. I’ll likely grind finer as I brew more and see if I can increase my extraction to pick up for fruit notes.",11,1762615347.0,pourover,3,0.92,False

It's Not as Simple as You Think.,"Planning a trip to France and wondering when you'll catch that perfect, crisp air? You've googled ""what is the coolest month in France?"" and are probably expecting a simple answer.

But France is a country of diverse climates, from the sun-drenched Mediterranean coast to the snowy peaks of the Alps. The ""coolest"" month for you depends entirely on what you're looking for: are you chasing the coldest temperatures, or the most pleasantly mild weather for exploring?

Let's break it down.

***

## The Literal ""Coolest"": January's Deep Freeze

If you're asking for the mathematically coldest month of the year across the country, the answer is unequivocally **January**.

This is the heart of winter. Days are at their shortest, and temperatures hit their lowest. But what does that actually feel like?

*   **In Paris:** Average highs hover around 43°F (6°C) and can drop to near freezing at 34°F (1°C). You'll likely experience gray skies, a biting damp chill, and the occasional dusting of snow that makes the city look like a scene from a movie.
*   **In Lyon:** Being inland, Lyon experiences colder temperatures. Expect highs of around 41°F (5°C) and lows that can dip well below freezing.
*   **In Nice (French Riviera):** Even the sunny south cools down. Highs are a milder 57°F (14°C), but the sea breeze can make it feel cooler. It's often sunny, but not warm enough for a swim.

### Who should visit in January?
*   **Budget travelers:** This is the low season, meaning flights and accommodation are often at their cheapest.
*   **Winter enthusiasts:** Perfect for a trip to the French Alps for world-class skiing.
*   **Those who hate crowds:** You'll have museums and attractions almost to yourself.

## The Traveler's ""Coolest"": The Shoulder Months of May & September

For most travelers, ""cool"" doesn't mean ""freezing."" It means comfortably pleasant. It means warm enough for a coffee at a sidewalk café, but cool enough to spend all day walking through a charming village without melting.

If that's what you're after, your answer isn't one month, but two: **May and September.**

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%20coolest%20month%20in%20France%3F)

These are the ""shoulder seasons""—the sweet spot between the chilly off-season and the scorching, expensive peak summer.

### May: The ""Cool"" Bloom
May is when France truly comes back to life. The chill of winter has vanished, replaced by a gentle, invigorating warmth.

*   **Temperature:** Expect pleasant highs of 64-68°F (18-20°C) in Paris.
*   **Vibe:** Parks are in full bloom, outdoor markets are buzzing, and the long daylight hours give you plenty of time to explore. The atmosphere is fresh and optimistic.
*   **Pros:** Gorgeous weather, fewer crowds than summer, everything is green and beautiful.
*   **Cons:** It can be unpredictable with spring showers.

### September: The ""Cool"" Harvest
Many consider September to be the single best month to visit France. The intense heat of August has subsided, but the golden warmth of summer lingers.

*   **Temperature:** Similar to May, with lovely highs of 68-72°F (20-22°C) in Paris and even warmer in the south.
*   **Vibe:** The summer holiday crowds have thinned, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. It's the start of the *vendange* (grape harvest) in wine regions like Bordeaux and Burgundy, making it a fantastic time for foodies.
*   **Pros:** Stable, beautiful weather, fewer crowds, harvest season events.
*   **Cons:** The first week can still be busy as some European holidays extend into early September.

## Why ""Cool"" Depends on Where You Go

France isn't a monolith. Your ideal ""cool"" month changes dramatically based on your destination.

*   **Northern & Central France (Paris, Normandy, Loire Valley):** Here, the seasons are distinct. January is cold, May/September are perfect, and July/August can be hot and humid.
*   **Southern France (Provence, French Riviera):** The Mediterranean climate milder. **October** could even be considered a ""cool"" month here, with warm days and fewer tourists. January is just ""mildly cool,"" not truly cold.
*   **Mountainous Regions (French Alps, Pyrenees):** The concept of a ""coolest"" month is different. The coldest is **January** or **February**, which is peak ski season. The summer months (July/August) are ""cool"" in the sense that they offer a warm but not scorching escape from the lowland heat, perfect for hiking.

## So, What's the Verdict? The Coolest Month for *You*

To find your perfect month, answer this: What kind of ""cool"" are you looking for?

| If you want...                                   | Your ""Coolest"" Month Is...                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| The absolute **coldest** weather and winter vibes | **January**                                               |
| The best **pleasant, mild weather** for sightseeing | **May** or **September** (tie for the best overall)       |
| Mild weather on the **Mediterranean coast**      | **October** (after the September heat fades)              |
| **Snow sports** and alpine adventure             | **January or February** (in the mountains)                |

Ultimately, the ""coolest"" month is subjective. For a perfect blend of great weather, manageable crowds, and beautiful scenery, you can't go wrong with the shoulder months of **May** and **September**.

1orroe4,https://campmateapp.com,How do you plan your packing for a camping trip? I built something and want feedback.,"A few months ago I was packing for a weekend trip, nothing special — just a simple overnighter at a spot I’ve been to plenty of times. I’ve done this enough that I should be able to pack in my sleep. But sure enough, I get out there, set up camp, and realize I forgot my damn rain jacket… on the one weekend where the forecast did, in fact, say rain.

It wasn’t the first time. I’ve forgotten headlamps, extra socks, coffee (a tragedy), you name it. I always think I remember what I need until I actually need it.

On the drive home from that trip, I started wondering why I was still doing this like it was my very first year camping. I’ve tried packing lists, but half the time I forget to update them. And every trip is different — warm nights, cold mornings, sudden storms — the weather kind of dictates everything.

So I ended up building a little tool for myself. It’s nothing fancy — you enter where you’re going and when, it checks the weather, and it suggests a packing list. More layers if it’s going to be cold, rain gear if the chances are high, fewer items if you’re only out for a night, etc.

I called it CampMate. It’s free, and I mainly made it so I’d stop kicking myself halfway through trips.

I’m sharing it here because I’d honestly love feedback from people who camp more or differently than I do. I know everyone has their own system, their own “must-bring” items, and I’m curious how this would hold up for someone else.

If you try it and something feels off (or you’d pack differently), I’d really like to hear about it. I’m still adjusting how the recommendations work.

And if you already have your own packing ritual, I’d love to hear that too — I’m convinced half the fun of camping is how we all prepare for it.",1,1762614411.0,CampingandHiking,0,0.67,False

I walked up to the bar right after the reception and got some pineapple juice and club soda with a lime (delicious!) and I sipped on several of those all night. My wife’s family are HUGE drinkers so I just said I was drinking tequila like I usually do. 

During the toasts I just held my champagne glass and pretended to drink it and just handed it back to the waiter after the speeches were done.

I’m super proud of myself this morning and I actually WANT to eat breakfast, have coffee, and go lift weights. Set myself up for a great weekend. 

After about a million sobriety attempts, this one feels different. I’m starting to realize that drinking doesn’t make any experience more special. It doesn’t make me “more fun” to be around. It doesn’t help me bond with anyone by drinking together. If anything, it made the wedding more special because I was present the entire time.

I essentially just writ them off altogether, as it made sense to me and I sort of just imagined them as a plant, even though I know it's a different genetic organism altogether than plants or animals. When I was keto in the past, I used to love mushrooms to add some variety to my meals and they've always made me feel fine/""better""when I eat them, but a lot of information about health on the internet misses out on key details of how we absorb the food we eat in a useful way, like for example vegans claiming spinach is as good as, or better than red meat for nutritional benefits (lol) but we can't actually absorb most of the nutrients due to antinutrients etc. Because of this I guess without looking into it that much, I assumed mushrooms were probably just another thing that, although probably better to consume regularly than most fruit/veg/plant products still were inferior to just eating OMAD products. 

Still the benefits for the brain, memory, cognitive ability and sleep are seemingly well studied with the likes of lions mane mushrooms and wild mushrooms, and I was curious about replacing my coffee addiction with mushroom coffee. I also just saw another video claiming that mushrooms could technically be consumed on carnivore without much ill effect, due to the low carb and relatively low fibre content. You wouldnt be knocked out of ketosis, the variety of the meals would increase exponentially, as all mushrooms, like all meats, have different flavour profiles and of course, health benefits.

Since I already consume plant based coffee, I will be trying mushroom coffee for sure and seeing how replacing one with the other goes over time, but I will also be researching eating mushrooms on carnivore more in the coming months before trying to include it in the diet. Typically, ordinary shop bought mushrooms are sprayed to oblivion with pesticides, at least that's what I've heard. Maybe soaking in vinegar water would take most of this away but not sure, so I would probably be looking into bulk buying dried wild mushrooms or something, occasionally getting oyster or shitake organic mushrooms, depending on the carb/fibre content, as I don't know how these amounts vary between different types of mushrooms.

I would like to know people's thoughts on this.",2,1762614164.0,carnivorediet,6,1.0,False

-De'Longhi ECP series (Amazon €110-150): this model requires some modifications, but it is very affordable and the only one of the three with a stainless steel boiler.

 -De'Longhi Dedica (Amazon €150): I have owned one for several years and know that it is long-lasting, but I would again need to make some modifications if I wanted to start making good coffee without pressurised filters.

-Cecotec Baristeo Intima (Amazon €250 new, 200 used in perfect condition): as far as I know, this is the same machine as the Gemilai Owl G3006. It seems to have everything you could want at this price point without requiring any modifications. The pressure can be adjusted by breaking a warranty seal, but if I understand correctly, it still has an aluminium thermoblock.

As for the coffee grinder, I think my only option to stay within budget is a manual one and I was thinking of getting the Kingrinder K6, which is the cheapest decent one on Amazon at €85–100.

From the very start I was a bit skeptical of that diagnosis, because even before seeing the doctor I was quite sure I had hypothylamic amenorrhea. But the ultrasound results don't lie, I have polycystic ovaries in addition to the absent periods, which does confirm PCOS.

I'm 5'1 and 120 lbs, so not overweight/obese. BUT after diagnosis I rapidly gained weight, putting on about 10 lbs in 2 months or so. BUT I was taking myo-inositol and I strongly believe it was correlated. So basically my periods stopped at 115ish, went to 120ish and maintained for a few months, then got diagnosed with PCOS and started inositol and rapidly went up to 130lbs. But myo-inositol usually causes weight loss. And even after stopping it, my weight went back down but I've felt like maintaining/losing weight has been difficult, and I've started having some acne and even noticed more hair on my face and body. I have normal levels of androgens, glucose, insulin, and A1C though.

So basically, I still don't know whats going on with me. Regular treatment (the myo-inositol and birth control, which I only lasted 12 days on) both caused horrible side effects, like weight gain, extreme appetite, fatigue, and depression. On the myo-inositol my bloodwork did show higher estrogen (although still below 20), but also higher insulin. I can specifically remember one day eating lunch drinking a coffee and then literally laying my head down on the table and crying because it was 2pm and I just ate and had coffee but I was so tired I couldn't stand up and still ravenous and fighting the urge to keep eating or to just fall asleep was so hard. I think I stayed there for like 20 minutes, and that was my breaking point. I did start to feel a little better after stopping both, but I'm still struggling.

I do still think it could be HA since I'm active (lift 5x a week and currently marathon training, although when my periods stopped coming it was only like 5x a week lifting and about 1.5 hours of walking per day) and do somewhat match those symptoms, but I wonder if I'm just gaslighting myself since I'm struggling to lose weight and maybe want permission to eat more.

I just don't know what to do. The protocols for HA and PCOS are so different.
Do I cut back on exercise or ramp it up? Do I intermittent fast or eat first thing? Do I go low carb or high carb? Do I eat more or less?

I feel like maybe my persistent low estrogen and PCOS has caused me to lose muscle and gain fat, and I'm very self conscious about how I look and don't know what to do, since horomone replacement (the birth control) did't work. I do eat clean (mostly, I've been messing up lately) and exercise but I still keep getting fatter. At this point I just want to take a GLP1 and get on with my I ife, but I know thats unrealisic.

I just don't know what to do. The protocols for HA and PCOS are so different.
Do I cut back on exercise or ramp it up? Do I intermittent fast or eat first thing? Do I go low carb or high carb? Do I eat more or less?

I feel like maybe my persistent low estrogen and PCOS has caused me to lose muscle and gain fat, and I'm very self conscious about how I look and don't know what to do, since horomone replacement (the birth control) did't work. I do eat clean (mostly, I've been messing up lately) and exercise but I still keep getting fatter. At this point I just want to take a GLP1 and get on with my I ife, but I know thats unrealisic.

**Cold Open**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – DAY**

*Joe, a kind but utterly clueless middle-aged man, sits in front of a brand-new printer surrounded by tangled cords and unopened manuals. The printer beeps angrily.*

**JOE**

*(to himself)*

It’s just paper, ink, and buttons. How hard can it be?

*He presses a button. The printer makes a grinding noise, ejects a blank page, and starts smoking faintly.*

**JOE**

Okay… progress?

***Cue theme song.***

**ACT ONE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – LATER**

Joe calls Tech Support. After a robotic menu nightmare, he finally reaches RAVI, a calm but weary technician from a call center.

**RAVI**

Thank you for calling HP Support. My name is Ravi, how may I assist you today?

**JOE**

Hi Ravi. My printer… it’s alive. I think it’s trying to fax my toaster.

*Ravi sighs quietly.*

**RAVI**

Sir, may I have the model number?

**JOE**

Sure thing. Uh… it’s “X” … and then a smudge of coffee… and then maybe a “Q”?

**RAVI**

Sir, could you read the label on the back?

**JOE**

I’d love to, but the printer’s on fire a little bit.

**RAVI**

*(on autopilot)*

Please unplug the device, sir.

*Joe unplugs his lamp.*

**JOE**

Done!

*The printer beeps louder.*

**ACT TWO**

**INT. JOE’S APARTMENT – CONTINUOUS**

*Ravi walks Joe through resetting the printer. Each step only makes things worse. The printer begins printing gibberish symbols and emojis.*

**RAVI**

Sir, that’s not supposed to happen.

**JOE**

Is it printing hieroglyphics? Should I call a museum?

**RAVI**

No, sir, please do not call a museum.

As Joe follows directions, the printer somehow connects to his microwave, which now says “READY TO PRINT.”

**JOE**

Oh great, now my lasagna’s getting updates.

**ACT THREE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – EVENING**

After two hours, Ravi and Joe have bonded through shared suffering.

**RAVI**

You remind me of my uncle. He once tried to print a PDF by holding it up to the scanner.

**JOE**

Your uncle sounds like a genius.

*Finally, Ravi suggests reinstalling the driver.*

**JOE**

Reinstall it? Ravi, I think the driver’s already left the vehicle.

*Joe accidentally presses the “self-cleaning” mode. Ink sprays everywhere.*

**RAVI**

Sir, please tell me you didn’t—

**JOE**

Oh, I did.

**TAG SCENE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

*Joe, covered in ink, finally manages to print one page. He holds it up triumphantly.*

**JOE**

It worked! Ravi, it worked!

**RAVI**

That’s wonderful, sir! What does it say?

**JOE**

(reads)

“Printer Error: Contact Support.”

*Joe stares at it. The printer powers down dramatically.*

**JOE**

Ravi… you still there?

**RAVI**

*(line goes dead)*

…

*Cue end credits and laugh track.*

I’m an American ICF PCC coach based in Madagascar. I’ve lived overseas since 2013 and have coached since 2014. I work in English and French. I have 1,000+ coaching hours in the last three years, with more if we look further back. My experience spans education, health, logistics, and humanitarian aid. I need to refocus after recent USAID funding cuts reduced my client load by more than 50% since July 2025. And because I was a subcontractor, I don’t have a path to those contracts independently.

I am the founder of a trilingual Montessori School in Madagascar and so in addition to professional executive coaching, I also have real experience managing/staffing/working with a school in an African context.

**I’m looking for practical guidance from this post, not actual clients:**

* Which units inside UNESCO, OECD, World Bank, UNICEF, or major foundations actually procure executive or leadership coaching for education leaders or ministries of education?
* How do you become an approved vendor or get coaching written into program budgets? Can this be done with a U.S. EIN, or through a Madagascar-based business? Again, I have worked as a subcontractor and want to do more direct work. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and would love to build up my own coaching firm (and subcontract other coaches).
* Which consulting groups or platforms are active across Africa right now and worth approaching for education or public-health leadership coaching? My personal historic client base is still mostly in the USA, but I prefer EMEA time zones, especially East or Sub-Saharan Africa, where most of my recent work has been.

My intent is to move from subcontracting to direct relationships. I am willing to travel and also work remotely. Focus going forward: education leaders (school directors, teachers, system leads) and ministries of education, although I've also enjoyed working in ministries of health (through a Gates Foundation program).

Happy to reciprocate for helpful pointers. I can offer a bit of mentor coaching to someone looking to get a PCC or a pro bono session to peers who share concrete intel or warm introductions. If that is not appropriate here, I am also fine to keep this as a straight knowledge exchange.

Comments preferred so everyone can learn. DMs are fine if you need to share specifics.

I’m here because I still believe in something genuine, two people who meet halfway, stay curious, and make space for something real.

I’m 35, from Romania, and work in digital strategy and legal content, a mix of creativity and precision that keeps my mind busy (and my coffee intake questionable). When I’m not working, I write fiction, build AI projects that try to make public systems more human, and get lost in psychology, mythology, and the strange ways people connect.

Physically, I’m 5'5"", pale-skinned, with dark brown almond eyes, pastel pink hair, a curvy pear-shaped build, full lips, and an expressive face that rarely hides what I feel. I’m drawn to tall white men with strong arms, warmth, confidence, and an optimistic, magnetic energy. The kind of person who moves through life with purpose and knows who they are.

I’m separated and will be divorced soon, so I’m emotionally available and genuinely open to connection. I’m not interested in men who are already in a relationship.

I’m especially drawn to men who are driven and passionate, professionally successful, and alive with hobbies and goals that make them feel electric. Someone who communicates openly, enjoys affection, and isn’t afraid to show it. I want someone who matches my energy, my intensity, and my curiosity about life.

I’m not necessarily looking to jump into a relationship, but I’m open to it if it grows naturally. When it comes to children, I’m leaning more toward not having them, but it’s not a definite no. If kids are something you know you absolutely want, we’re probably not a fit.

People juggling 3 projects, going on long hikes, launching side hustles, all while replying to texts on time. Meanwhile, most days just disappeared into YouTube, random tabs, and vague guilt. If that sounds painfully familiar, this post is for you.

This didn’t come from a productivity coach with a perfectly color-coded Notion board. This is real-world wisdom drawn from books, podcasts, behavioral science, and high-performing (and very human) people. Because let’s be honest  TikToks screaming “wake up at 4 AM and grind” aren't helping anyone. Most of that content is aesthetic cosplay or neurotic hustle culture rebranded as self-care.

It’s not about forcing strict schedules or using 6 apps you’ll delete in a week. Efficient time use isn't about control. It’s about understanding how your brain, energy, and attention actually work  and planning around those. Here’s what actually helps:

 Use “biological prime time” instead of forcing willpower  

   Coined by author Chris Bailey in The Productivity Project, your biological prime time is when your energy naturally peaks in a day. For some, it’s 9-11 AM. Others find flow at 10 PM.  

   He tracked his hours for 3 weeks and found his highest energy wasn't mornings, despite all the “early bird” hype. Your brain isn’t lazy. It just has rhythm.  

   Want to get better at time management? Stop planning your hardest tasks when your brain is at 40%. Move deep work into your peak zone.

 To-do lists are broken try time blocking instead  

   A classic to-do list creates an illusion of progress but not momentum. You feel productive, but your brain is just scanning and procrastinating.  

   Cal Newport, in his book Deep Work, recommends time blocking: assigning exact time slots for your tasks.  

   There’s even research from the Behavioral Science of Time Management study published in Nature Human Behaviour (König & Waller, 2021), which shows that placing tasks on a calendar — not just listing them  increases follow-through by over 80%.  

   Example: Instead of writing “Finish report,” block 2 PM to 3:30 PM as “Write section 1 of report.” No vague goals, no ambiguity.

 Your brain can’t multitask  it’s lying to you  

   The American Psychological Association has published multiple studies confirming what most of us feel but deny: there’s no such thing as effective multitasking.  

   Instead, you’re rapidly task switching, which burns up to 40% more time, according to Dr. David Meyer from the University of Michigan.  

   Solution: Use “single-task sprints.” Set a 25–45 minute timer. No tabs. No texts. One task. Then a break. Sounds simple, but most people have never actually done this on purpose.

 Make time visible with a time audit  

   Most people dramatically underestimate how much time they waste. Like 4–5 hours vanish in “just checking stuff.”  

   Nir Eyal explains in Indistractable that doing a time audit helps expose your blind spots.  

     For 3 days, track what you spend every hour on. Not just work. Be brutally honest. TikTok counts.  

     Then compare it to what you wish your week looked like. That delta is where your priorities get hijacked.  

   You don’t need to feel bad — just name the patterns. Awareness creates space for change.

 Create “activation triggers” to beat resistance  

   Behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg (author of Tiny Habits) found that the best way to start tough tasks isn’t motivation. It’s anchoring.  

   For example, link tasks to habits you already do.  

     “After I make coffee, I open my writing doc.”  

     “Right after my lunch break, I schedule 1 task I’ve been avoiding.”  

   These micro-routines create momentum with almost no mental push.

 Protect your attention like you protect money  

   Time isn’t your real problem  attention is.  

   According to a 2023 report by RescueTime, knowledge workers lose an average of 2.8 hours per day to interruptions and context switching.  

   Solution:  

     Put your phone somewhere physically distant. Literally in another room.  

     Use an app like Freedom or Cold Turkey to block addictive sites during deep work blocks.  

     Train people to respect your work time. Use status indicators, turn off Slack notifications, or set ""Do Not Disturb"" hours.

 Don’t rely on motivation  build systems  

   Motivation isn’t sustainable. It’s mood-dependent. Discipline gets overhyped too.  

   The real key is default behavior. James Clear, in Atomic Habits, says: “You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.”  

   That means:  

     Batch similar tasks together to reduce friction (e.g., check emails just twice a day instead of 30 times).  

     Set up your environment to minimize decision fatigue (e.g., use the same morning routine, set your gear out the night before).  

     Automate or delegate anything that doesn’t need your brain.

 Use the “2-Minute Rule” to prevent procrastination pileup  

   From David Allen’s Getting Things Done: if a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.  

   This tiny rule clears dozens of tasks that otherwise become mental clutter.  

   Bonus tip: if starting something feels overwhelming, tell yourself: “I’ll just do 2 minutes.” Often that’s enough to trick your brain into full engagement.

 Plan your week, not your day  

   People overestimate what they can do in a day but underestimate what they can do in a week.  

   Every Sunday, block 30 minutes to sketch out the big rocks for the week.  

   Best tip I got from the Make Time book by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky (both ex-Google designers): Choose 1 highlight per day. Just one. Once that’s done, everything else is bonus. This helps keep both expectations and wins realistic.

 Create a “done list” to build momentum  

   A weird but powerful brain hack: instead of just tracking your to-do list, keep a “done list.”  

   Write down everything you finish.  

   This builds positive reinforcement. Your brain starts craving the dopamine of completion — so you do more.  

   Studies from Harvard Business School (Amabile & Kramer, 2011) show that “small wins” are one of the most powerful sources of daily motivation.

No need to use all of these at once. Try one that resonates. Time management isn’t about becoming a robot or squeezing out every ounce of your day. It’s about taking back control from the noise and putting it where it actually matters to you.",1,1762613012.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

1orr19p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orr19p,Where can I find THC vape or weed in Riga?,"How I went to Riga (Latvia) with my friends and went hunting for weed or thc vape/pen

A little background: I recently went to Riga with two friends. We were thrilled - we wanted to walk around the old town, admire the architecture, and, of course, try the local specialties.

To be honest, we were a little curious about the local herbal remedies (well, let's say, “herbs” for fun), but we quickly realized that it wasn't as easy as it seemed. We thought that Riga was a European capital, so there must be some laid-back places here, or at least some locals who could give us some tips.

First attempt: we asked a barista in a trendy cafe - she politely said she didn't know and quickly changed the subject to Latvian coffee.

Second attempt: we tried to talk to people at a popular music venue. Everyone was friendly, but either didn't understand what we were talking about or gave vague answers that led nowhere.

Third attempt: we decided to wander around the markets and streets in the hope of getting some random advice. Nothing - just fresh vegetables and souvenirs.

When we had almost given up and switched to enjoying the parks and local food, one of our friends suddenly remembered Telegram. We started looking for themed groups and channels -and lo and behold! We found a person who turned out to be a real guru of local affairs. He responded quickly, gave us reliable contacts, and even helped us arrange a meeting.

In the end, this hunt became a funny story that we still laugh about - sometimes the coolest thing about traveling is not what you were looking for, but what you found along the way.",17,1762612805.0,u_tortoclas78,5,0.96,False

I totally love how this thing looks:
Everything is deliberately designed as if it were some shady underground pressing - crooked stamps, ""coffee stains"", typewriter font... even the tracklist looks like it was pasted on.

The best thing: the record is completely official.
At the time, Aerosmith wanted to celebrate the bootleg spirit because really good live recordings were mainly passed around as unofficial recordings. So they just faked it themselves and released it officially. Very meta, very 70s.

Musically, the piece isn't just a gimmick either - nice and rough, lots of energy, a wild mix of different tour recordings.
“Train Kept A-Rollin’” really hits the spot on this issue.

My version is a late 70's CBS pressing. Not a super-rare find, but a super cool piece of rock history that you're more likely to play loudly than hide on a shelf.

Prologue

 

“Elric\~ I am sorry\~\~ My parents suddenly call me over yesterday, they said my little brother got caught in a accidents and is recovering on the hospital so I don’t have a choice to go there”

“Oh\~\~ That’s fine, I wish a quick recovery\~ as for the group assignment… It’s already done so you don’t have to worry\~”

 

‘Haah’

 

Inwardly sighing, I waved goodbye to my ‘friend’

 

“Liar… Lie, it’s all lie…”

 

My head dropped down, staring at the floor, I muttered under my breath and lift my head again.

 

“…”

 

In front of me is my laptop, displaying a word filled with thousands of words, scrolling above, a text wrote ‘Group project’ and below it is 4 names of students including me.

 

“Let’s just finish this at home, sent it to the professor, and get some nice sleep.”

 

I close the laptop, cleaning up the mouse and headset by putting it to my bag neatly.

 

“Well at least this café is nice… let’s stay here for a little longer”

 

With that word, I wave to the staff and order some nice looking latte, well nice looking according to the picture on the menu.

 

As the staff smile with their characteristic professionality, I support my chin with my right hand and glance outside the window.

 

Somehow, my mind recalls the disappearing figure of my ‘friend’ earlier.

 

“…Shit…”

 

I cursed, feeling irritated of recalling the encounter of another lie in my life.

 

“Just drop dead… really”

 

Not enough with the first curse, I sent another one, now toward that particular ‘friend’

 

‘Haah, At this point… I don’t mind it if they actually start dropping truth of not wanting to work, I might feel less annoyed’

 

They say recalling one bad or embarrassing moments, another one will show up. I read about it in some journal. They say it’s because since your brain is already in negative emotion by recalling one bad memories, your brain will find it easier to brought up similar memories.

 

And I understood now why.

 

The memories of being first lied at.

 

My sister lying and pinning the blame on me to avoid being scolded.

 

My middle school friends circle lying to me and leaving me alone while they’re going out together because they find me boring.

 

Many other memories swimming up from the corner of my mind.

 

Now another one is added, my friend lying to me so they can dump all the work to me.

 

“Is… lying really that… convenient? Don’t they feel bad about it?”

 

Now reaching the point where I began questioning the common sense of society.

 

“Politics is full of lie, Friends is full of lie, School too… even in my family… no where is safe huh?”

 

Such sentences tugged a bitter smile at my lips.

 

I spent so much time and immersed myself in depressive thinking that I didn’t notice the Latte already placed before me.

 

“Damn it, begone evil thoughts”

 

I pick up the latte, it’s warm.

 

Bringing it close to my mouth, my nose naturally pick up the scent too

 

It’s peaceful and smell good too

 

“Really… only coffees never lie about their taste, smell and temperature… ah, cigarettes too”

 

After spewing remarks that people will find nonsense, I take a sip of the coffee, before taking a large gulp of it.

 

“…Fuu, that’s the best”

 

I smile, now full of positivity, and turn my head toward the window.

 

“Right, nothing beats a coffee and a nice scenery.”

 

Anticipation, Excitement, and many positive feeling began pushing out the negative thoughts, this is why I love coffee so much, couple it with a nice scenery, I feel like transcending beyond human’s sense

 

“…Hm?”

 

But when I turn my head, the scenery is strange…?

 

A huge metal object is covering the previous greenery and road bustling with people and couples.

 

“…Ah.”

 

After snapping out of my thoughts, I realized.

 

\-BOOM

 

A bus somehow flew toward me, know that my drinking spot is on the third floor, naturally, a normal bus won’t reach this place.

 

‘Fuck… hope I got  reincarnated or something…’

 

With that last word and my blurry vision, the last string holding my consciousness and my life snapped apart.

 

……

 

“Unfamiliar ceiling…?”

 

Familiar word… the problem is that it’s me the one spewing that, not some protagonist in a novel fiction.

 

“I actually did?”

 

I actually got reincarnated.

 

“Wait no, why is it this world…?”

 

Was about to jump in happiness at the thought of reincarnation with my past life memories intact, I realized I got reincarnated into a game I usually play.

 

“Mother… please let me go back”

 

Such realization hit me like a slap, waking me up and my desperate wish to return to my former life.

 

Because the game I reincarnated into… is really… really suck.

\--------

The idea behind this novel is to be frank, a pretty damn cliche type?

Basically I was planning to write a novel where the mc is a male who has the natural ability of his own to discern lie through words, expression, or events. It's basically an instinct of some sort for him, his capability of discerning lie reach to the point of discerning even smallest lie contain in a word, or even a lie mixed with truth.

The plot I was planning to go with is... um don't judge me for this but it's a plot where mc reincarnated in a game, a terrible game because of many death flag a character can encounter. The plot here is that, the MC will try to live through his new life, having giving up returning somewhat, and while he's at it, he wanna tried various stuff he can't tried in modern world where magic and swords doesn't exist. But well, the problem is whether at the beginning or midway through the plot, he encounter a total of 3 female (you can say they're the heroine in this game, and in this novel I am writing too).   
  
Few hurdle, few stuff over, and the three female got obsessed with the mc (becoming a yandere), as many trendy novel nowadays, yandere will always lied to their loved interest, hiding secret, mostly for their own benefit to have mc for themselves, and in many novels, the mc is so dense that they didn't even notice this. But since this mc I am writing is different as he can discern the smallest lie, even in expression and events, he know the yandere is telling him lies, even knowing the manipulation hurling toward him and around him. With this capabilities of observing lie, he naturally aware of other's view of him, so he knew the obsession of the yanderes has for him. He hates lie, so he avoid the yanderes. Ironically, he avoid by lying too. With his smart mind, he also know how to manipulate, and using that to counter the manipulation the yanderes sent toward him.

This is basically it... you can say it's a novel idea born from my short-live-frustration when reading dense and passive mc... but I just don't really care...

1orqwo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1orqwo5/first_month_sober/,First month sober,"Hi all!

I wanted to make a small post to comment that today marks my first month sober after years of drinking. I'm posting this on a Saturday morning, a moment where I was usually useless due to hungovers. I can't say this first month has been easy. I'm still struggling with the daily stress of life, I feel overly irritable, etcetera. But the good things outweigh the bad ones. I'm sleeping better, not feeling tired all day, I'm being able to focus on things and even I drink far less coffee than I used to because I don't need it that much. There are some times where I feel tempted, as I feel unable to deal with the burden of being alive sober, but I successfully surfed through these moments and I realize I can, and that life is much more of a burden drunk, hungover, and tired.

Now I'm facing the challenge of redefine my life without alcohol. My goals, my relationships, my friendships, and so on. I'm facing a blank page. It's scary but it's also exciting.

1orqvl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liverpool/comments/1orqvl6/three_days_in_liverpool_a_review/,Three Days in Liverpool (a review),"We spent three days in Liverpool and this is my personal take on the city and surrounding area.

We arrived via the Stena ferry from Belfast which, after a short bus ride, drops passengers off at the Hamilton Square Station in Birkenhead. From here we took a train one stop to James Station for 3.65£. Our flat was actually closer to Lime Street but the ticket agent gave us incorrect info. Such is life. Our flat was in the Cavern Quarter and the first night we ate at Flanagans Apple and called it a night around 2100. (We don’t drink nor do we like crowds)

On the second day we walked down to the waterfront to see the Beatles statue and then walked to the Lime Street Station to catch the Northern train to Mossley Hill for 3.65£. The ticket agent at LSS was adamant we couldn’t walk from there to Penny Lane or Strawberry Fields but we did easily. It took less than an hour to walk it through some picturesque neighborhoods. Penny Lane was cute but Strawberry Fields imo was a huge scam. The “museum” takes 70 minutes to listen to on the audio guide but you can read it all in ten minutes. The original gates to the house are hidden in the garden and you’re basically paying 11.75£ per person so see them. The ones out front are a replica. Lennon’s childhood home is in this area but we opted not to pay money to go inside and only took a few photos from the outside. We caught the 76 bus for 2£ back to Queens Square. 

After an afternoon nap, we caught the Merseyrail train to Blundellsands & Crosby to go to Crosby Beach where they have 100 statues over two miles of the beach. A roundtrip ticket was 4.80£. The sun was setting and we spent a few hours photographing various statues. It’s one of the coolest art installations I’ve ever seen. 

After catching the train back, we went to the Cavern Restaurant for supper but it was underwhelming. The food came out less than a minute after we ordered which was concerning. We tried to go to the Cavern Club but they charge 5£ to enter and are cashless while we’re cardless when we travel. It’s not even the original Cavern Club so we would have declined even if they took cash. We walked over 17 miles this day. 

On our final day we spent time walking around Bold Street and on the waterfront again. Otherwise we spent the afternoon quietly reading at a Starbucks near the Cavern Quarter. 

We stayed in Kabannas which was fine. We were on the 4th floor so we couldn’t hear the noise of the city like other guest have complained about in reviews. 

Overall, it was a nice visit and my favorite city we’ve been to so far on this trip that’s also included Dublin, Belfast and Galway. We have Glasgow and Edinburgh left. We found locals to be extremely friendly and welcoming. We never felt unsafe or anything but we were never out after 2100 on any night. The coffee is a lot better in England than it was in Ireland for sure.",19,1762612409.0,Liverpool,15,0.81,False

BRS BATTLES, SUSPENSE ACCOUNT SECRETS & A DEEP DIVE INTO PARTNERSHIP LAW 📊⚖️

Hey Reddit fam 👋
Welcome back to The Internship Diaries — your daily sneak peek into my accounting internship adventures, where Excel sheets rule the day and coffee fuels the brain ☕💼

So today was Day 9, and it was honestly one of the most intense and detail-heavy days so far. The tasks were endless, the errors were sneaky, and the suspense (both literal and accounting) was real 😭

🕒 Time In: 10:30 AM
🕕 Time Out: 7:10 PM

📋 Tasks of the Day
1️⃣ Accounting for 3 firms — all purchases and sales 🧾
2️⃣ Recording and reconciling their bank accounts 🏦
3️⃣ Clearing suspense accounts and locating wrong entries 🔍
4️⃣ Deleting duplicate entries (yes, the ones hiding in every corner 😩)
5️⃣ Verifying previous months’ transactions for consistency 📚
6️⃣ Preparing Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) and finalising for Income Tax Return filing 🧮📤

The morning started smoothly — until I discovered that one firm had multiple duplicate entries for the same purchase, each tagged under a different ledger 😭. I spent nearly an hour tracing which entries were valid and which were ghosts haunting the books 👻.

Then came the suspense account — which, ironically, was full of suspense. 😂 After digging through vouchers and emails, I finally matched a ₹15,000 mismatch that had been sitting unresolved since August. The satisfaction after clearing that account? Unmatched. 🙌

Post-lunch, things got a bit tense when the BRS didn’t match by ₹1,120 — and the senior accountant said, “Don’t leave your chair until that difference disappears.” Challenge accepted. 😤 After double-checking every entry, I found an unrecorded bank charge that had been auto-debited — classic! Once fixed, the reconciliation matched perfectly, and I swear, it felt like solving a mystery case 🔍💥

💡 Mini-Learning of the Day:
During my “break” (which somehow turned into a mini lecture session 😅), I had a great chat with my supervisor about Partnership Deeds — their rules, clauses, capital contribution adjustments, and how profit-sharing ratios can affect tax liabilities. It was honestly fascinating to connect accounting with the legal side of business 🤓⚖️

By the end of the day, I had finalized all three firms’ accounts and got them ready for Income Tax Return filing — probably the most satisfying checkmark of the week ✅

So yeah — a day full of reconciliations, suspense clearances, and legal learnings. Who knew accounting could be this dramatic and rewarding at the same time? 🌸

See you all tomorrow with more from my internship chronicles! 🚀

1orqr66,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfInvestigation/comments/1orqr66/on_being_decaffeinated/,On Being Decaffeinated,"I've been backing away from caffeine for a little over a year. The major motivation is sleep. For whatever the reason I metabolize caffeine poorly (apparently), so even a small amount makes my hyper alert in the middle of the night - even 12+ hours later.

It took a while to figure out. My espresso machine was a favorite possession and I loved launching into my day with elevated intensity, clarity, and motivation.

Everything in my ""sleep hygiene"" was in good order - including keeping caffeine under 200mg and always early in the morning. But after many years my sleep was continuing to worsen.

Finally I cut caffeine and, damn, after a couple weeks, best sleep.

Not saying ""caffeine is bad""- rather it is generally bad for *me* at this point in my life, apparently. The knock-on effects of bad sleep dwarf the perks of caffeine.

It has been pretty fascinating to cut back...

At first it felt like something was missing, like a degraded experience. But slowly I'm seeing a flip side. I no longer feel like each day is a mission to get through a gauntlet and my trusty sidekick will power me through it. I'm more inclined to sit and stare out the window vs throw myself at anything for any other reason...

I'm not suggesting this is a good way to live or this is how I ALWAYS feel. Nor am I suggesting it's impossible to stare out the window while caffeinated. I'm merely sharing the subtle contrast from my perspective.

I still have caffeine occasionally. If I get bad sleep and/or I DO have an actual gauntlet of stuff to do, I accept the tradeoff. Or sometimes it's social, like grabbing a cappuccino with friends in a middle of a long hang.

This is less about caffeine and more about ""who we are"" (no shock there).

Zooming out a little.... we are our experience - and if that experience is chronically altered - even subtly - (whether by caffeine or any other habit loops) - then that is who we are and we might forget it could be any other way. I had been drinking coffee daily for over 20 years, and completely forgot what life was like without it. It is yet another influence that I completely lost track of.

But I feel like steam is my biggest issue (or the length of steam time?). I will generally do something like 18-19g of espresso for a 2-2.5 oz. shot, with 6 oz. whole milk steamed to \~150-155. I'm pretty sure I've got most things moderately nailed down: I've got a hand grinder (kinggrind p1) my grind / tamp seem about right (pulls take \~25-30 seconds), I'm using a bottomless porta-filter with a correctly sized basket. In the resulting espresso, there's a nice cream on top and it's delicious tasting.

I like the latte I get for the most part - to me it seems as good if not better than a good chunk of nearby coffee places.

But I find myself having to steam the milk twice (or even 3 times if I go for a slightly larger 200ml of milk). This just feels wrong - but may be a shortcoming of the machine? I don't know.

If I steam it twice (letting the boiler 'heat up' and the green light come on again between) generally the foam is nice / decent (sometimes good!). If I go for a third to hit the appropriate temp for 200ml of milk, it kills the foam. I temp it with a thermometer to make sure I don't go 'too hot'. I have replaced the stock wand with a different one from Amazon and it works nice enough.

I'm curious if there are other options for steaming the milk though - perhaps 'stronger' options. I'm sure the foam is partially due to my poor technique; but I also feel because the steam from the machine is a little on the weak side and it takes so long to heat up the milk that it hurts the overall process. Are there 'standalone steamers' that work better? Would trying a different wand help? I'm just looking for something that will help get a better/stronger vortex and heat up faster / steam longer. I think that may help my overall process - but I don't know! Any advice appreciated.",2,1762611824.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Basically, we have our great relationship with minor disagreements, the problem started when a girl named Aditi (23) shifted into my apartment along with her mother. The house was under construction, so we had to share the bathroom. The owner said it will last for maximum 20-25 days and so i agreed, One day her mother was ill, so i rushed her to the hospital as she was not in the city, from then she used to call me brother, and i was super happy because i am a social-awkard person and it was the 1st time, i made any relation with my own. She used to talk to me. She even once cooked vegetables 1st time and gave to me to try.I was happy like I found a sister, I built this relation as my own. But once accidentally, she was changing and I saw her in bra from backside(as the room was right straight to my room and whenever i open my room, her room is visible), she had not closed the door of her room properly, it was for less than 1 second, but it did happen. I ignored the fact thinking she is my sister, after that i was awkward from talking to her but she initiated like nothing happened, so i continued. Later that day, she asked to go to the temple with me(as i go every Tuesday), i said okay, i had nothing in my head(i was just seeing her as my sister) but eventually we didn't go. After that, incidents arose like she used to left her panty in the bathroom which i felt quite discomfortable and i told her, she stopped doing that.

I used to share all those things to my girlfriend, but one day i realised that none brother-sister do that and so i shared it with my gf. She told me the same thing that she also felt uncomfortable,so  I decided not to talk to her. After that i went home for diwali, when i returned, she, Aditi, told me that she may be suffering from blood cancer and she was alone as her mother didnot return from the vacation, she came alone, so i talked to her in some bits, after that day, she knocked my door telling that she is having menstrual periods and it's her 2nd day, and requested to bring painkillers from medical store, i did that, and after 15 minutes, i made black coffee for her too as she was alone and she had been in real pain. After that, nothing, I started to ignore her, like just random talks of a maximum of 5 minutes in bits in the whole day.

I was doing all that because I was feeling uncomfortable, as well as my gf was. But now my gf, Anushka, said i will also live my social life, and accepted follow request of a random guy, who eventually tried to flirt with her, and rather than telling him that she has a boyfriend or just blocking him, she just diverted the topic and continued the conveersation until the guy again flirted, then she left the message on seen and did nothing.

She is telling me that she did this so that i will realise how she felt in those moments, but i did all those unintentionally (as I had made my first relation with a stranger), and i have understood the things and will make sure not to happen ver again and she is doing those intentionally after a period when nothing like the above things have been happening, when i am telling her this is also considered as microcheating like mine was considered she is saying NO and telling that she did nothing wrong.

Didn't she do wrong too, and she must understand it as I did. What should I do from here on? I am planning either to shift my room or to stop talking to Aditi completely, as she must be reassured.",2,1762611610.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

Has anyone got similar beard? I dont want to dye it, but natural colour changes maybe to mesh it better? Coffee rinse? Natural alternatives?
