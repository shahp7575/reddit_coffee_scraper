1ppnbii,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ppnbii/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend_after/,AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend after running into her with my friend’s boyfriend,"I’m 27 and I honestly still feel like this all sounds fake when I say it out loud, but it happened.

Before my girlfriend, I had a long, complicated thing with someone I’m still friends with. We hooked up years ago, tried to be friends, stopped talking, started again, all of that. At this point, we’re just friends. We text, we catch up sometimes, nothing physical, nothing flirty. She has a boyfriend and has for a while.

My girlfriend has never been comfortable with this, but I thought we had kind of reached an understanding. She didn’t like it, I didn’t cut my friend off, and we just avoided the topic unless it came up.

Last weekend, my friend asked if I wanted to grab coffee because she was having a rough week. I told my girlfriend I was meeting a friend. I didn’t hide who it was. I didn’t think I needed permission to see someone I’ve known for years.

Here’s where things go completely off the rails.

While I’m sitting at this coffee shop with my friend, I look up and see my girlfriend walk in. Except she’s not alone. She’s with my friend’s boyfriend.

I honestly thought I was hallucinating. I actually checked my phone to see if I missed a text or something. Nope. She sits down with him at another table. They’re talking. Laughing. Way too comfortable.

A few minutes later, my friend notices too and goes completely quiet. Turns out my girlfriend had messaged her boyfriend earlier that week. Her explanation later was that she wanted to “see what it felt like” and “prove a point” since I refused to stop being friends with my past hookup.

At this point I’m embarrassed, angry, and feeling like I’m in some kind of reality show. My girlfriend sees me, realizes I see her, and comes over like nothing is wrong. She says something like “well now we’re even.”

That was it for me.

I told her we were done. Not quietly either. I said if she thought trying to get attention from someone else’s boyfriend was a reasonable response, then I wanted no part of this relationship. She said I forced her into it by choosing my friend over her.

Now she’s telling people I broke up with her because I “prioritized a past hookup.” I feel like that completely skips the part where she intentionally went after someone else’s boyfriend to make a point.

So AITA for staying friends with someone I have a complicated past with, and for breaking up with my girlfriend after I caught her doing the same thing she accused me of but on purpose?",1,1766052781.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1ppnasj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ppnasj/am_i_overreacting_about_workplace_harassment/,Am I overreacting about workplace harassment?,"I (22f) have been getting harassed by my coworker Olivia (37f) pretty much the entire time I have been with the company. Its been 3 years now, and for a while I would just grin and bear it but it became too much recently. It started off inconsequential where Olivia would make fun of the genre of music I listen to, or the type of movies I watch, or what kind of coffee I drink. Nothing I could really complain about, but annoyed me nonetheless. I would occasionally complain to coworkers when I was particularly annoyed and they would use the excuse of thats just how she is. 

One day when I was working with Olivia she (justifiably) complained about another one of our other coworkers and I made the mistake of telling Olivia that this other woman had asked me if I was a virgin since I was so young and I worked most weekends so I didn't have time to go out (her reasons for asking). I told Olivia that I was super uncomfortable with this other coworker overstepping my boundaries, but I had ultimately answered her to get her to stop. Olivia then asked if I was a virgin and I once again awkwardly said yes in order to move on and never have to deal with the conversation again.

That was three years ago now and Olivia (who for context is straight) won't drop it, every time I work with her she brings it up. If its been awhile since we've been scheduled together she'll ask me if I'm still a virgin and I dumbly answer truthfully because I know that even if I lied she would just ask me more questions related to sex and the imaginary man. But most days she just tells me that I need to get my first time over with, that it doesn't matter who its with because I won't enjoy it anyway. She would also make jabs about the size of my orifices and how I should start preparing myself if I wanted to ever sleep with someone. 

I know that most of this is my fault because I let it go on, but this was also my first real job and I never wanted to rock the boat. I knew that since I had considerably less seniority that I would be the one let go not the other way around. Not to mention that Olivia is good friends with the higher ups, like bridesmaid and honorary aunt to their children good friends. That knowledge solidified in me that I couldn't tell anyone because I knew nothing good would come of it. 
Olivia has had multiple boyfriends since I started there (no shade, I'm not a prude despite my virginity) but she has informed me that all of her boyfriends know me as her virgin coworker, because she ""finds it so weird that someone is a virgin in their 20s."" Olivia's newest boyfriend Harry is the most interested by my virginity, while her past boyfriends would tell her to leave me alone. 

A few weeks ago when Olivia and I were alone she told me that her and Harry had been once again discussing me and my lack of sex life. She told me that Harry told her that he would have sex with me so I could get it over with, and that in this scenario Olivia could sit in a chair in the room and watch. 

Something in me snapped when Olivia told me this story. She acted like it was a funny little anecdote and it really seemed like she expected me to laugh along with her. I never should have been something she discussed with her partner, that conversation never should have happened. I felt sick to my stomach and I somehow compartmentalized that interaction enough to finish my work day. 

I went home and cried for what felt like hours because my brain couldn't process what she had told me. She had crossed my boundaries more times than I could count, but this was way too far. I even threw up multiple times thinking about it. I'm honestly dry heaving while typing this all out because I'm reliving it. I can't let this go, no matter how hard I try. My best friend and sister in law, the only two I've told outside of work, think I should talk to a professional to help me move one. My work friend is telling me I'm need to just let it go because I haven't been as happy since it happened. I know I haven't been, but I also think its insane that she seems to think I should just go back to normal, sorry for subconsciously putting up barriers with everyone. 

So I ask, am I overreacting? Was Olivia never doing anything wrong and I just took it as harassment? And am I overreacting with my response to the whole situation?",1,1766052697.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Let’s say you make $2000 a week driving for uber 12 hours a day six days a week. That comes out to $8000 a month and it seems like a lot until you realize that’s the gross amount and start adding up all your expenses.

So $8000 minus taxes minus car lease minus medical insurance and minus gas. So that’s $3000 in taxes a month, 1600 in lease payments a month ,

Let’s say $1000 for med insurance and $1000 in gas . That comes out to $6,600 a month in expenses and leaves you with $1,400 a month for yourself.

And let’s say you use that $1,400 a month to buy food while you work and snacks and cigarettes and coffee, which can easily add up.

So then you would have nothing left for yourself after all that hard work. Which is crazy. You wouldn’t even have enough money to take home to pay rent and utilities or for groceries to stock your fridge.

So you would basically be working for free which is really nuts.

1ppn5qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1ppn5qy/how_to_get_a_vpn/,How to Get a VPN,"You're sitting in a coffee shop, checking your bank account on ""FreeWiFi\_Guest2,"" and you just Googled ""how to get a VPN."" Smart move. Except if you click the first ""FREE VPN"" ad that pops up, you might as well have just handed your data to the guy in the corner wearing a hoodie.

Here's what nobody tells you: getting a VPN is easy. Getting a VPN that actually protects you? That takes ten minutes of reading this instead of five seconds downloading whatever shows up first in the app store.

I've spent 12 years cleaning up after data breaches, and I can tell you exactly what happens when people choose wrong. Let me walk you through this properly.

# The Free VPN Trap (And Why 2026 Was a Nightmare)

Before you do anything else, burn this into your brain: 88% of free Android VPNs leak your data. Not ""might leak"" or ""could potentially compromise""—they actively leak it.

In May 2024, the FBI dismantled what's thought to be the largest-ever botnet built from at least 18 fake free VPN apps. Every person who downloaded those apps turned their device into a proxy server for attackers. That's 19 million hijacked devices.

SuperVPN had a breach that exposed over 360 million user records—email addresses, real IP addresses, browsing history. The exact things a VPN is supposed to protect.

Why do free VPNs fail so spectacularly? They make money by collecting and selling your browsing activity, search history, IP address, and physical location to advertisers. You're not the customer. You're the product being sold.

I once audited a company whose finance director had used a free VPN for ""security"" while working from a beach in Thailand. That free VPN injected JavaScript into his browser sessions that logged every keystroke. Cost the company $400K in fraudulent wire transfers before anyone caught it.

# What to Look for in a Paid VPN (The Stuff That Actually Matters)

Alright, so you need to pay for a VPN. Current pricing ranges from $2-4/month on long-term plans (usually 2 years) to $10-15/month if you go month-to-month. For context, that's less than two coffees at Starbucks per month for the annual plan.

But which one? Here's my evaluation framework after testing dozens of these for client deployments:

**Independent Security Audits** – And I mean multiple, repeated audits by firms like Deloitte or PwC. One audit from 2019 means nothing. The best providers get audited annually and publish the results. If a VPN company won't let third parties verify their no-logs claims, they're hiding something.

**Modern Protocol Implementation** – WireGuard is the current gold standard for speed. But here's the catch: vanilla WireGuard has a privacy issue because it assigns static IP addresses that could theoretically be tracked. Some providers have addressed this with custom implementations that add privacy layers while keeping the speed advantages. That technical detail matters more than marketing claims about ""military-grade encryption.""

**Jurisdiction and Transparency** – Where is the company actually based? Panama, Switzerland, British Virgin Islands—these locations have favorable privacy laws and no mandatory data retention. The VPN market was valued around $44-50 billion in 2022-2023 and is projected to reach nearly $76 billion by 2027, so everyone's jumping into this space. Don't trust the hype. Look for transparency reports showing what government requests they receive and how they respond.

**Server Network and Specialty Features** – You need servers in locations you'll actually use. But beyond that, look for specialty servers: obfuscated servers for restrictive networks (China, Iran, UAE), P2P-optimized servers if you torrent, multi-hop routing if you need extra anonymity layers. Most basic VPNs don't offer these.

**Post-Quantum Cryptography** – This sounds futuristic, but it's relevant today. Threat actors are harvesting encrypted data now to decrypt it later when quantum computers become powerful enough. Some VPN providers are already implementing NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms. Is it necessary for watching Netflix? No. But if you're protecting financial data or business communications, the ""harvest now, decrypt later"" threat is real.

# The Actual Process (Finally)

Once you've chosen a provider, here's the step-by-step:

**1. Sign Up on the Provider's Website**

Never download a VPN from a third-party app store before paying. Go to the official website. You can pay with credit card, PayPal, GooglePay, Apple Pay, or even cryptocurrencies if you want extra privacy. Most offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you're not locked in.

Pick the longest term you're comfortable with—the monthly cost drops significantly. A 2-year plan typically runs $3-4/month versus $12-15/month monthly.

**2. Download the App**

After payment, download the app for your device(s). Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux—reputable providers support everything. Some even have browser extensions, though I prefer full system-level apps for better protection.

The download is typically 50-100MB. Takes maybe 3 minutes on a decent connection.

**3. Install and Log In**

Installation is dead simple now. Click through the prompts (it's not 2010—no manual configuration needed). Log in with the credentials from your signup.

Most apps will ask permission to create a VPN configuration on your device. Allow it. That's how the encrypted tunnel gets established.

**4. Connect to a Server**

Here's where beginners overthink it. For general use, just click ""Quick Connect"" or whatever the auto-select button is called. The app will choose the fastest server near your location.

If you need a specific country (streaming content, accessing region-locked services), manually select that location. Takes one click.

Connection establishes in 2-5 seconds with modern protocols. Your IP address is now masked. All your traffic is encrypted.

**5. Verify It's Actually Working**

Don't just trust the app. Go to whatismyipaddress.com or ipleak.net and check your IP address. It should show the VPN server location, not your real location. Also check for DNS leaks—reputable VPNs handle DNS requests internally so your ISP can't see what websites you're visiting.

# Mistakes I See All The Time

**Forgetting to Enable the Kill Switch** – This disconnects your internet if the VPN drops. Without it, your traffic might leak when the connection fails. Enable it in settings immediately.

**Using Weak Authentication** – If your VPN account gets compromised, attackers can see everything you do through it. Use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication.

**Connecting Through VPN for Literally Everything** – Your banking site might flag VPN logins as suspicious. Use split tunneling to route specific apps (like your bank) through your normal connection while everything else goes through the VPN.

**Never Updating the App** – Security vulnerabilities get patched constantly. Enable auto-updates or check monthly at minimum. SonicWall's recent string of VPN vulnerabilities and Ivanti Connect Secure's zero-day exploits in early 2024 showed that even enterprise VPN solutions need constant patching.

**Assuming You're Anonymous** – A VPN hides your traffic from your ISP and masks your IP from websites. It doesn't make you anonymous from the websites themselves once you log in, and it won't stop you from downloading malware or falling for phishing. It's one layer of protection, not a magic shield.

# What to Do After Setup

**Test Your Speed** – Run a speed test (speedtest.net) with VPN off, then with VPN on. You should see 5-15% speed loss with a good provider using modern protocols. If you're losing 40-50% of your bandwidth, something's wrong—try different servers or protocols.

**Set Up Your Router (Optional but Powerful)** – Many VPNs let you install directly on your router. This protects every device on your network automatically, including smart TVs, IoT devices, and game consoles that can't run VPN apps. The tradeoff is slightly more complex setup and potentially slower speeds if your router isn't powerful enough to handle encryption.

**Configure Your Mobile Devices** – Install the app on your phone. Around 69% of VPN users access via mobile, and that's where you're most vulnerable—public WiFi at airports, hotels, coffee shops. Set the app to auto-connect on untrusted networks.

**Review Your Privacy Settings** – Most VPNs collect minimal connection data (timestamps, bandwidth usage) for operational purposes. Check your account settings and disable any optional data collection if you're privacy-focused.

# The Uncomfortable Truth

VPN usage in the US dropped from 46% in 2024 to 32% in 2025. Why? Some people realized they didn't actually need one for casual browsing. Others got burned by free VPNs and gave up entirely.

The reality is nuanced. If you're just browsing news sites at home, your ISP can see which sites you visit but not what you do on them (thanks to HTTPS). A VPN adds another layer, hiding even the site names from your ISP.

Where VPNs are absolutely essential:

* Public WiFi (airports, hotels, coffee shops)
* Torrenting or P2P file sharing
* Accessing content in censored countries
* Protecting business communications on home networks
* Preventing ISP throttling based on traffic type

If none of those apply to you, you might not need a VPN running 24/7. But having one available when you travel or use public networks? That's just basic digital hygiene in 2026.

According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, the US recorded nearly 860,000 complaints of internet-enabled crime in 2024—over 2,000 reports every single day. Your data is a commodity. The question isn't whether someone wants it, but whether you're making it easy for them to take it.

Chapter 2: The Start of Something New

Zoey woke up to the soft buzz of her alarm. She sat up slowly, rubbing her eyes.

Today will be better.

She didn’t know how—but she hoped it would be.

She slid out of bed and headed straight to the bathroom to take a shower. She let the steam fill the room, running her fingers through her blue hair, trying to calm the ache in her chest from yesterday. When she turned off the water, the room was fogged over and peaceful. Zoey wrapped herself in a towel and started brushing her teeth, the mint waking her up more than the shower had.

As she brushed, the air cooled and her hair began to dry in uneven waves. By the time she spat out the toothpaste and rinsed, her blue strands were already springing into their usual messy shape—fluffy at the ends, uneven, soft. Zoey ran a comb through it once, maybe twice, then gave up with a small sigh and a smirk.

It’s good enough.

She pulled on her clothes for class—comfortable, layered, a little thrown together—slung her bag over her shoulder, put on her headphones, and headed out toward campus.

As she walked, she saw students crossing the sidewalks in groups, clutching coffees, backpacks bouncing against their sides. Zoey moved at her own pace, calm music playing in her ears. She watched puddles shimmer under passing tires, leftover rain giving everything a soft glow. Her messy blue hair caught the breeze, strands falling in front of her face. She didn’t fix them. She liked it that way.

By the time she reached campus, the buildings buzzed with quiet energy. Students piled into lecture halls, conversations drifting through the open courtyard. Zoey pushed open the heavy door to her building and made her way inside, slipping quietly into a seat near a window with her headphones still on. Students were already seated.

Then suddenly—the door slammed open.

Everyone jumped a little, including Zoey.

A guy rushed in, slightly out of breath, with messy purple hair, pale skin, and bright violet eyes.

Kai: “I—uh—hi. I’m not late. You’re late. The clock is lying.”

A few people laughed. The professor didn’t even look up from her attendance sheet.

Professor: “Kai, it’s 8:07.”

Kai pointed dramatically at the clock.

Kai: “Exactly! The clock is wrong; it betrayed me!”

The class laughed again. Zoey tried to hide a smile, laughing softly behind her sleeve. The professor sighed.

Professor: “Just… sit down, please.”

Kai: “Yes, ma’am.”

He scanned the room for an empty seat, and the second he spotted Zoey, his boldness softened. His smile turned gentler, warmer. He walked over, quieter now.

Kai: “Is this seat taken?”

Zoey shook her head.

Zoey: “No, it’s not taken.”

The classroom settled as the professor began talking again, her voice filling the room with the usual morning routine. After a few minutes, while Zoey took notes, she felt something slide gently against her elbow. She looked down.

Kai had pushed a small folded note her way.

For a second she hesitated, then opened it quietly.

Hi. I’m Kai.

A tiny warmth rose to her cheeks.

He wrote this for me.

Why does this feel so gentle?

I should say something back.

She picked up her pen, wrote slowly, folded the note once more, and gently slid it back to Kai.

Kai: “Zoey,” huh.

He didn’t say it loudly—just enough for only her to hear. Zoey felt a tiny spark in her chest at the sound of her name coming from him. She tried to focus on the board, but her eyes drifted toward him on their own.

Kai wrote something quickly and slid the note back. Zoey opened it.

Nice to meet you, Zoey.

Her cheeks warmed again. She was about to write back when the professor walked over, placing a stack of papers on her desk.

Professor: “These are your reference sheets for today. Make sure you keep up with them.”

Zoey: “Oh—okay. I will.”

Zoey continued writing notes as her mind wandered.

Why did he talk to me?

There were so many open seats… so many other people.

But he chose here.

He chose me.

It felt nice—having this kind of attention from a cute guy.

Class went on. The professor explained examples, pointing to diagrams and underlined sections. Students scribbled notes, flipped pages, highlighted key parts. Eventually, the professor wrapped up the lesson.

Professor: “Alright, that’ll be all for today. I’ll be posting the rest online.”

Chairs slid back, bags zipped, and conversations filled the room as students headed toward the door. Zoey packed up, and as she stepped into the aisle, she heard a voice behind her.

“Hey… Zoey, right?”

She froze for a second.

Kai.

Zoey: “Yeah—that’s me.”

Kai gave a small, almost shy smile, one that made his purple eyes stand out even more.

Kai: “So, uh… I was gonna stop by the café to get some coffee before my next class,” he said, trying to sound casual but coming off a little nervous. “Do—do you want to come with me?”

Zoey nodded with a small smile.

Zoey: “Sure. I was actually thinking about getting some coffee too.”

They walked across campus together, the breeze cool and soft around them, leaves scattered across the pavement. Neither of them rushed. The silence between them was surprisingly comfortable.

They reached the café, a small place tucked between the library and an art building. Warm light glowed through the windows, making it feel cozy and safe. Kai held the door for her, and Zoey stepped inside, Kai following behind.

The smell of roasted coffee beans and cinnamon hit instantly, soft music playing in the background. Zoey looked up at the chalkboard menu, then at Kai.

Zoey: “So… what do you usually get?”

Kai: “Something simple. Like black coffee.”

Zoey: “Black coffee?”

Kai nodded. “Yeah. It’s simple, right?”

Zoey tilted her head. “It just seems kind of strong.”

Kai: “I like the bitterness.”

Zoey smiled faintly. “You don’t seem like someone who’d like bitter things.”

Kai raised an eyebrow. “Really? Then what kind of coffee person do I seem like?”

Zoey hesitated. “Hmm… maybe something warmer. Like a latte.” She looked away quickly. “Something comforting.”

Kai glanced at her, smiling. “Comforting, huh?”

Zoey blushed. “I meant—in a coffee way.”

“Right,” Kai said, still smiling. “In a coffee way.”

He stepped up to the counter.

Barista: “Hi, what can I get for you today?”

Kai: “Hi. Can I get two vanilla lattes?”

Barista: “Of course. Will that be all?”

Kai: “Yes, that’ll be all.”

Barista: “Okay, that’ll be $12.70.”

Kai paid with his card. Zoey noticed he’d ordered two.

Zoey: “Why did you get two lattes?”

Kai handed one to her. “This one’s for you.”

Zoey: “Oh—thank you. You didn’t have to do that.”

Kai: “It’s my pleasure. I wanted to.”

They found a small booth by the window. Sunlight spilled across the table, dust particles floating in the air. Zoey set her cup down carefully as Kai sat across from her. They sipped their lattes in comfortable silence.

Kai: “You look like you belong here.”

Zoey: “I usually grab coffee and sit by windows. It helps me forget things.”

Kai tilted his head. “Forget things?”

Zoey didn’t answer. She stared out the window—and the memories came.

Not just one.

Three.

Flashback One

It starts with Steve—her first real relationship. They’re sitting in his car, parked outside her apartment late at night. He won’t look at her, fingers tapping the steering wheel like he’s building courage.

Steve: “Zoey… I think we want different things.”

Zoey blinks, confused. All she ever wanted was to matter to someone.

Zoey: “Different things? What do you mean?”

Steve: “I don’t think this is working anymore.”

Her heartbeat stutters, her throat tightening instantly.

Zoey: “…What? What do you mean it’s not working?”

He finally looks at her, but his eyes aren’t the same.

Steve: “You’re just… emotional. I feel like I’m constantly having to lift you up. I can’t keep doing this.”

Her chest aches so sharply she grabs it without thinking.

Zoey: “Steve, please… don’t do this. I love you. I’ll try harder—I swear. I can fix whatever you’re upset about.”

Her voice breaks as tears spill over.

She reaches for his hand, gripping it like it’s the only thing keeping her grounded.

Zoey: “Just talk to me. Tell me what you need. I can change. I can be better. Just… don’t go.”

Steve pulls his hand away.

Steve: “You shouldn’t have to change this much. And I shouldn’t feel drained all the time. It’s better if we end things.”

Zoey shakes her head, desperate.

Zoey: “No—we can fix this. I love you. Doesn’t that matter? Please… I don’t care what it takes. I just want us. I just want you.”

She sobs. “I promise I’ll be better. I’ll stop overthinking. I’ll stop being too emotional. I’ll be easier—just… don’t leave me.”

Steve looks at her, and that’s when she knows.

It’s already over.

Steve: “I’m sorry, Zoey.”


---

Flashback Two

The memory fades into another.

She’s home the next night, her face still puffy from crying.

Mom: “She needs to stop being so dramatic.”

Dad: “If she can’t keep a boyfriend and she can’t keep a job, what is she even doing with her life?”

Zoey hears them from upstairs and breaks down, sobbing into her pillow.


---

Flashback Three

Another memory flashes—her manager at Starbucks snapping at her in front of customers.

Unbelievable!

Go mop it!

Lilith, you take over!


---

The café fades back into focus.

Kai notices immediately.

Kai: “Zoey? Are you okay?”

Zoey stands abruptly.

Zoey: “I—I’m sorry,” she says quietly. “I have to go.”

She rushes out the café doors, heading back toward her apartment.

I started because nothing else was working.

Coffee just made me anxious and stimulants left me fried by noon.

So I stopped chasing dopamine and ran a boring experiment.

No caffeine spikes and no expectations. Just two capsules every morning for thirty days.

The first week was quiet. No surge in focus or sudden productivity explosion.

But I became less reactive to stress and distractions.

I finished tasks without forcing myself through them.

By week two the afternoon drag was gone.

It wasn't replaced by energy just an absence of friction. I could finally work without negotiating with my own brain.

That is when I realized this is a baseline stabilizer not a stimulant replacement.

By week three the results were consistent enough  that I [decided to stick with mind lab pro](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.mindlabpro.com%3Fa_aid%3D625b30d0c6fa1%26a_cid%3Df4c782b0) instead of cycling through random stacks.

Here is exactly what stabilized in my routine:

* **Clear mornings** where I could start deep work immediately without waiting for caffeine to kick in.
* Calm focus that stayed level throughout the day instead of crashing at noon.
* Functional thinking even on days where I had short sleep or high stress.
* Zero physical side effects like jitters heart racing or digestive issues.

It didn’t make me feel on something.

It just removed the mental noise that was slowing everything down.

That said this is not for everyone.

If you want a hard kick of motivation or instant results you should skip it.

And if your sleep diet and workload are a mess no supplement will save you.

But if you are burned out on stimulants or coming off heavier protocols this fills a very specific gap.

I would give it a full thirty days before judging it.

Not because it is slow but because the effect compounds quietly.

**Introduction**

Voice search is quickly becoming the way people find what they need nearby. More and more people now ask their phones things like, “Hey Google, best salon near me,” or “Where can I get coffee right now?” If your business isn’t ready for that, you might be missing out. 

For those exploring [**digital marketing courses in Bangalore**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vdpBTD77zFdiyTov5), learning voice search strategies in an institute like Da360 can help you reach more customers and stay ahead of the competition.

**Why Voice Search Matters for Local SEO**

When people talk to their phones or smart speakers, they search differently. More conversational, more location-based. For local businesses, that means a huge opportunity to capture traffic that’s ready to act.

According to the data, a significant part of voice search queries has a local intent, for example, ""near me"" or ""in my area"". 

One source indicates that people who use voice search to find local services are likely to take immediate action. They will visit or contact a business in a very short time. 

Nowadays, voice assistants frequently use information from featured snippets or quick answers, so it is necessary that your business is the one providing the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌answer. 

**Common Mistakes Businesses Make**

* Using​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ short, typed-search keywords repeatedly instead of using conversational, question-style phrases.
* Not paying attention to their local listings. An incomplete or inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across different platforms decreases the visibility of a business for voice search.
* Having a website that is slow and not mobile-friendly. A lot of voice searches are done on mobile devices, and users want their queries to be answered instantly.
* Failing to structure the content for voice. Not having FAQ pages, not having obvious conversational answers, and not having schema ‌ ‍ ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌markup. 

With proper training from Da360's [**digital marketing courses in Bangalore**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vdpBTD77zFdiyTov5) with placement, you can learn to structure your website, optimise your listings, and make your brand voice-search ready.

**Key Steps to Leverage Voice Search for Local SEO**

**Here are actionable strategies you can implement:**

* **Research ‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ conversational keywords and questions:** Utilize a tool like AnswerThePublic or Google ""People also ask"" to find out the common spoken language people use when they ask about your business.
* **Optimize your local business listings:** Keep your business profile (e.g., Google My Business) complete with address, hours, services, photos, and reviews. This is what voice assistants often use.
* **Put schema and structured data to use:** Incorporate LocalBusiness schema, FAQ schema, and speakable schema so that voice assistants can surely get your content.
* **Develop conversational and localized content:** Create pages that provide answers to questions like ""Where can I find the best \_\_\_ near me in Bangalore?"" or ""What time is \_\_\_ open in \[neighbourhood\]?"" Local landing pages are important.
* **Speed and mobile optimization:** Try to make your website load time short, ensure it is mobile-friendly, and easy for voice search users to navigate.
* **Prompt and Manage Reviews:** Reviews are one of the factors that voice assistants may consider when making ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌suggestions.

**Emerging Trends in Voice Search for 2025**

Local​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ queries will largely be done through voice search in the future. There would be more “near me” type searches, and mobile voice interactions would increase.

Generally, a voice assistant prefers to give a single answer; therefore, the importance of being at the top (featured snippet) is gradually increasing.

It is natural language and conversational content that weigh a lot more than strict “typed search” keyword ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌strategies.

Tools & Tactics to Boost Voice-Search Visibility

* **Tools for conversational keyword research:** AnswerThePublic, AlsoAsked.

* **Schema generator / Structured data markup tools** to add FAQ schema, LocalBusiness schema. 
* **Site-speed and mobile-friendly testing tools:** Google PageSpeed Insights, Mobile-Friendly Test.
* **Analytics**: Track question-based queries, long-tail voice-type phrases, and call-tracking from voice search traffic

1ppn0tu,https://i.redd.it/ei3usl06qx7g1.jpeg,The best piece of latte art,"…I have managed to create so far. 

My fiancée gave me/us a Breville Barista Express for my birthday 4 months ago and ever since I have been hooked. 

While I’m aware of its limitations, I believe it is a great machine! And so far, the built-in grinder got us great results (apart from a few beans that needed a REALLY FINE grind for which I bought a hand grinder). 

I managed to dial in the shots and make coffee that I prefer over what I can get in most cafes. After all, it’s the beans that make the biggest difference. 

But the real challenge has been the steaming and pouring latte art. We usually drink 3 coffees each a day, nearly always milk drinks. We prefer oat milk (I feel like the earthy notes support the aroma of the coffee) and are using Oatly Barista, as it’s the best one we can get around here in the UAE. 

Steaming full fat milk is a lot easier but we simply don’t like the taste of hot milk. But after 4 months of practice, I finally managed to create something that resembles latte art. And I am a little proud of myself, so I felt like sharing. Because apart from my fiancée, nobody cares about my latte art attempts. 

Now if anyone has tips and tricks to improve the results, I am thrilled to hear them!


PS: I feel like the Breville pitcher with the temperature scale doesn’t get enough appreciation.

If you take your gf out and starts with that attitude I swear when I look back at things the only moments I enjoyed with her was sex was the only thing we didn’t fight about anything, now we get to the worst part where my heart was shattered is when I got her pregnant I was completely shocked but I was actually happy about it was very enthusiastic about it and she also was happy but she was very afraid about what her parents would say and how they would react, when I completely lost my feelings for her is when we got in a fight because she didn’t want to have the baby and I did so I told her that when she had the kid I was gonna take it and end everything with her and then she started threatening me with drinking pills for killing herself and my baby for me to carry the responsibility the rest or my life and guess what I did forgive her since she told me it was the shock of being pregnant man this was awful by this moment I returned to USA and man I almost went insane big texts threatening me with my kid, with her life it was a genuine headache I started underperforming in college I quitted didn’t went to classes started working wince a baby was coming to my life it was a 360 turn in life, but then fights started scallating I started to not give a fuck and I know it sounds horrible but I was tired I was working from 6 am to 9pm everyday for her to call me at every morning fighting over crap I started blocking her, deleting her from everything because she genuinely killed my empathy this actually made her have a spontaneous abortion which I felt horrible in me I havent felt the same since then and for apologizing to her I bought us a trip to colombia which was nothing but horrible she fought over everything 😭, but when I lost the last bit of love I had over her was one day that she drank a couple of margaritas and yes to be honest at this point I was fed up from the fights so when we got to the airbnb with our uber I just hopped out and got into our room and she was mad and to have my attention she didn’t went in I tought she was only outside waiting for me to come out and give her attention but I couldn’t simply I was fed up I felt horrible since I genuinely wanted to enjoy our trip so I got a text fro. Her telling me that she was very surprised on how I could leave a woman alone at the street and I didn’t want to fight so I got out (I leaved the door open for her to get in) and she wasn’t there then I asked her where she was and she replied that I shouldn’t worry that she was gonna get back to el salvador and that I was alone from that moment on, I started to freak out since it was pitch black and colombia its not the safest country I started to ask her for her actual location and she ignored me completely then she explicitly said “ I wish I really wish that I get sexual assalted, I wish I get raped for you to live with that in your conscience”and she reapted it many times, then that she was gonna sue me and get me behind bars I was like this girl is genuinely out of her mind that was the moment I ended things with her but she refuses and rn I don’t know what to do she told me she is gonna change but man I don’t want tot continue this I will leave with all the good things we lived and forget everything else, please I need advice serious advice I feel better only on writing this, also another thing I want to mention is that rn I react badly when she wants to argue and talk about things I raise my voice or completely ignore her that another reason I want to end things completely because I don’t want to make her suffer the only thing is that I am worried and have that burden of conscience that she could do something to herself.

**Score Bet**: **-110**

Wager Amount: 1.1U to WIN 1U

League: Los Angeles Rams vs Seattle Seahawks (7:15PM CST on Amazon Prime)

**Recap**: Canes dominated the SOG from the jump. Preds just did not have many output to match Canes offensive attacks. Should have gone 2U on this play! I so wanted to! But nonetheless a win! Had a couple plays that I was going to plug in for the NBA short slate. **Bulls ML✅** (+180) and **Josh Giddey O 8.5 Asts✅** (-120). Both plays hit but I felt like those plays were a flip so I went wit my most confident play in the Canes 60-Min ML! Hope y'all tailed!

**Matchup:** Not confident on today's POTD, **but I'm going for it because it's the most popular game on Thursday nite. I would rather go to Hot Key, but that's not what I'm all about here, even if I have the most confident wager there I will likely go where the demand** is which today it is the TNF matchup between the Seahawks and Rams.

**I'm going to take a chance here wit this line. This 42.5 seems fishy and when you see something fishy it's best to just stay away from it, but I just can't. I'm going for O 42.5 like a rat into a trap. It was O/U 43.5 the other day and now it's even less? I'm confused AF. Is it because it's raining out there severely?** Not that Seattle is not use to the rain. I'll take the Over 42.5 wit two of highest scoring teams in the league, but both **these teams are also two of least points allowing defense in the league as well.** Somethings gotta give in this divisional rivarly matchup.

The last time these two teams met it went below this line, but I just think that Sam Darnold is going to have a much better performance than throwing 4 INTs and I think the Rams will be fine witout Davante Adams. Both defense are also capable of scoring. I think we might see one punt return TD or a pick six. **Not supremely confident on today's POTD, but If you're giving me these lines I'll gladly take the O 42.5!**

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.1U on O 42.5 in the Rams/Hawks game. Final score 23 to 20.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

I’ve had a long-term digestive issue since I was around 10. I regularly deal with intestinal gas, sometimes with a noticeable odor, and I experience ongoing discomfort in my lower abdomen and rectum. Often, I feel a strange sensation as if my anus is slightly open or relaxed, which makes me worry that gas might escape. Even when I feel this way, I still produce gas normally. My stools vary based on hydration; they can be normal, harder, or softer. However, I don’t have constant diarrhea or severe constipation. What makes this situation especially challenging is its strong connection to stress and social situations. My symptoms worsen significantly at university, in cafés, on public transport, and when I’m sitting near others in quiet places. They improve a lot when I’m home or relaxed. Just the anticipation or fear of symptoms can trigger gas and discomfort, creating a vicious cycle. Coffee sometimes makes it worse. I mostly eat home-cooked food, avoid fast food, and drink plenty of water. I once saw some improvement when I cut down on bread and pasta, but the symptoms returned. So, there’s no clear dietary trigger. I’ve seen multiple doctors over the years, including recently, but examinations didn’t reveal anything unusual. I was prescribed simethicone (Meteoxane) for about 2 to 3 months. It provided limited relief but not a real solution. This issue has affected my confidence, social life, and ability to speak comfortably with others for many years. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but I’d like to know if this pattern points to a functional GI disorder like IBS, gut-brain axis dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity, or pelvic floor tension.

# Title

> Advice/ideas? Scam swarm in r/Bellingham over Joy Division-style T-shirts

# Post contents

---

tl;dr: Any tips for protecting your subreddit from scam swarms? We got hit and a bunch of people clicked scam links and entered personal and financial info while trying to buy T-shirts.

I'm looking into Bot Bouncer after searching through this subreddit, and would love whatever else you've got for advice. 

--

A user posted a T-shirt with the outline of Washington State in the style of Joy Division/Joy Plots using GIS data.

People wanted to order it, and all of them got spam responses from a scam company (not, we thought, OP). 

We whack-a-mole it, but THEN a mod from a nearby subreddit (r/Seattle) DM'd us to warn that OP was a known scam account that's been capturing established accounts and taking them over for their spam army or whatever. We're fairly experienced Redditors (and our head mod has been at it for five? years), so we routinely check profiles, post history, etc., and saw no big flags.

But the scams are clearly happening, so we delete, ban, message OP.

Plot twist: OP replies, claims innocence, offers to meet the mods to prove it's a real, local person's account (but not this week because traveling) and names a slightly obscure local coffee shop for a future meeting.

We'll sort through all of it but my bigger question is how other mods would deal with this and/or what steps you'd take to try to prevent a repetition of this absolute nonsense.

FWIW, our sub requires 10 karma and two days, which all of the spammer accounts easily cleared.

My fellow mod's post about it has more detail: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/s/zF8wAWmwUu

Fwiw, we use old Reddit/new Reddit/laptop/mobile pretty variably and one of our mods is a Tech Hero, so hit me with whatever range of options you might have.",1,1766051114.0,modsupportremovals,0,1.0,False

So there's CSAM for your ebox and whatnot. All options look like big buttons. A line around it, an icon, and text. Should be a button or behave like one you'd think. Nice, you think, I don't have to aim precisely and can just slam my mouse or fat finger somewhere close enough. Nope. Only clicking the text works reliably. Oh yeah: the whitespace just right of the text sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Seems to depend on which direction your mouse came from.

Around the village, there are a few similar sized villages. 

The next city is a 1-hour-car-drive away. When I am there, especially for an extended amount of time, I get anxious and start feeling sick. Especially when I think about that the next hospital is far away, but also when I think about the fact that there isn’t any restaurant, take-away (only a supermarket and a coffee shop) and only 400 other people. There isn’t much to do, you need a car to do basically anything. And the roads have many curves, which makes me feel very sick when driving - maybe that’s how the negative association has formed? Also, the house of my in-laws is quite small, so I have nowhere to “escape to”. I feel stuck and life feels small. I honestly start feeling sick when I only think about going there (even though I like my in-laws; it’s really the place). I know this sounds exaggerated, but this is the way I feel when I am there.

Also, I grew up in a city/suburb and haven’t spent much time in the countryside aside from day trips (which make me feel fine).

I’ve always been comfortable with more traditional dynamics in relationships. I don’t mean outdated gender roles necessarily, but I do lean toward a lead–follow structure. I prefer clear roles, consideration, and yes, sometimes asking or checking in before making certain plans.

I’ve also realised I lean submissive in relationships, in day-to-day dynamics. Decision-making, deference, permission vs informing. I used to think this was fairly normal or at least neutral, but hearing others talk, it seems some people see this as unhealthy or “too traditional.”

For example:
If you’re in a committed relationship and you’re going out to meet someone of the opposite sex (coffee, lunch, nothing romantic), do you ask your partner first, inform them, or just go?

Some people say asking is respect. Others say it’s control. Some say it's inexperience. 

I’m genuinely confused where the line is, especially when power dynamics are consensual and desired by both people.

So I’m curious:

1. Is wanting that kind of structure a red flag?

2. Can a sub/dom or traditional dynamic still be healthy and modern?

3. Or am I setting myself up for imbalance without realising it?

Would love perspectives, especially from people who’ve navigated this long-term. This is mostly for women but I think men can answer too. ",5,1766050542.0,Uganda,2,1.0,False

Am I overreacting?,"My wife and I are approaching our five-years of marriage this April. During that time we both knew one another’s passcode to the other’s phone. All that changed 8ish months ago when I began working night shifts at a hospital;

Sometimes working 60-70 hours a week. 

Now, my wife works at a mid-size company (300-400 employees). She has a management role - quite high on the hierarchy. She’s gregarious, attractive. popular, quick-witted, is a very motivated and works her tail off. Saying all that, she flirts with certain male coworkers. I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that she dresses to show off her figure. 

My wife has become friendly with a coworker whom; I will call James. James is married, and he texts my wife while on his way home. In some texts he wrote “I love you,” “Thanks for your help. You have an IOU coming your way”.   Which she contests it’s an IOU such as having lunch, brining her coffee, or whatever. She has even told James, “good night” at 9-10 p.m. Never heard of professional relations between  individuals who say “good night” to each other at those hours. And, I’m dubious that the “IOU” is what she claims it to be. 

She minimizes most, if not all flirtation, as harmless fun.  She made the comment to James, when he was leaning over the desk, “Don’t start what you can’t finish”. Harmless flirtation huh?!?!

\*\*\*\*\*REMEMBER SHE CHANGED HER passcode, I had a 5-10 minute opportunity to see a few texts - took screenshots. One text from James read, “I’m getting close to home, so I can’t text. Good night. I will see you tomorrow”. James is married, and it would make sense that he wouldn’t text while his wife is around. 

Her response to the text messages,and flirtatious behaviors is, “she enjoys being the woman… enjoys the feeling of being desired.  Being able to be part of the guys (drinking beer) etc” - I don’t drink alcohol. 

I can understand the feeling of being desired, and being complimented, but we’re married and there’s a limit: if the boundary has been crossed communication MUST CEASE and DESIST. Any relationship must be kept strictly professional. When office hours are over, any sort of communication should end with the exception of an emergency. Especially when one is in a management role. I don’t believe I’m being unreasonable. 

Oh, BTW, she NEVER invites/ nor invited me to meet any of her male coworkers. When I ask that I’d like to meet them, her response is, “it would be awkward”. Again, WTF! 

Sometimes my wife will pick our daughter up from school and take her to work. A different employee, Randy, gives our daughter candy and soda; takes her on tours of the building; hangs out in his office; Randy and her have taken pictures of her; and she goes with him on rounds -  Randy is a supervisor…..Randy has asked our daughter to call him by a pet name - La-boboo or something.. And, our daughter refers to Randy by the pet name. 

Now, I found out that my wife called our daughter, on speakerphone, with Randy, in her office, and asked Randy to give our daughter “advice”…..🙄🙄 🙄

\*\*\*Our daughter is a teenager, and is going through challenges at school and home\*\*\*\*\*.. GIVING HER ADVICE, and helping her navigate this period of life is MY JOB. NOT RANDY, JAMES, or any other schmucks… BTW our daughter found it really strange and hung up. 

I am livid…. Livid is putting it mildly.  I’m furious with my wife, James, and Randy! I believe family affairs are to remain within the family and NOT BROADCAST, especially to men. I would feel differently if it were one of her girlfriends.

Am I overreacting? My wife isn’t painting an all-together a flattering picture. For sure it looks like something is amiss. How would you handle  this if you were in my shoes? She’s adamantly said she’s been faithful, and that she loves me. 

Again, am I being overreacting and being paranoid because I don’t believe she’s been faithful in an emotional sense at least, and might not be faithful physically… ",5,1766050317.0,Marriage,10,1.0,False

1ppmnq5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppmnq5,Alien Implants and Nanotechnology Research,"In January of 2009, an abductee, hereafter referred to as AJ, found an unusual hair following an ET encounter. This article includes conscious memories of some of the events that occurred prior to the discovery of the hair as well as images showing preliminary microscopic and spectral analysis of the hair that was found subsequent to the encounter. It was nighttime and AJ was inside the house standing at the front door facing a female hybrid appearing humanoid with straight, shoulder-length, whitish gray hair. The hair was described as, “so perfect it did not appear to be natural hair.” The female humanoid’s eyes were “very dark brown” and AJ said “she had a distant stare on her face, and did not blink.”  
  
AJ had a strong and immediate reaction to the humanoid female and felt that “something was not right at all.” Although AJ says the front door was never opened, the hybrid entered the house nonetheless. AJ also heard the alarm chime beeping as if the door, had in fact, been opened, which tells us AJ probably *did* open the door for the unusual looking woman. Having perceived an intruder had entered the home, AJ ran for the family room, but before reaching the door to the family room, AJ heard what sounded like their neighbor in the kitchen talking about the food inside the refrigerator. Oddly, in reality, this particular neighbor had never before been inside AJ’s house.  
  
Upon entering the kitchen, AJ experienced “a gut wrenching primal fear” and even though they wanted to protect their family, they could not run away. There was shouting, but when AJ reached the kitchen there were no longer any verbal sounds being made. AJ states: “I believed this was accomplished by the use of a type of sound dampening field that diminished and obscured sound waves. However, since this was also this point where my conscious memories of the event begin to fade, it is possible I was in the process of being removed from my house and taken elsewhere.” The process of being physically taken by these entities involves a temporary physical alteration of the subject’s immediate environment. AJ is, “...100% certain that I was abducted that night… I have experienced this far too many times and I am extremely familiar with what it feels like….There is a particular type of tension related to the abduction event that many times goes unnoticed on a conscious level….my sense of hearing seemed to be in hypersensitivity mode….many times the transport occurs very quickly, as in the flash of a light or in the blink of an eye. The time here may not pass much at all or there may be ‘missing time,’ but the time on their side is… a much longer interval.  
  
The following morning AJ said the coffee maker was still plugged in and set to turn on, but it didn’t come on as it normally did. A ceiling fan closest to the kitchen door was also left on, which was also unusual since it was freezing outside. (This encounter occurred in January.) AJ added, “Oddly, I also felt as if I had to clean the house….I soaped up the kitchen countertops and cleaned the hell out of everything….It was as if I was decontaminating the place. Then I vacuumed the floors and the rug….I cleaned everywhere the alien had been the night before.” AJ continued, “Because I am not a person who is obsessed with having a clean house, it is likely my behavior… was directly related to the presence of the female humanoid…”  
  
Two days later AJ discovered an unusual gray hair in the master bedroom’s walk-in closet and remembered it being one of the rooms in which the female was seen two nights previously. The hair was discovered lying on top of several black socks that had been placed on top of an ironing board. The socks were clean and they had been there, undisturbed, for several days. They were also there prior to the encounter with the hybrid. The hair was longish and whitish gray, just like the strange hybrid’s hair looked. AJ believes, “in a way, it was almost as if I was meant to find it: as if it had been intentionally placed there for some reason….I know it wasn’t mine because I don’t have long gray hairs in my hair.” The hair was placed in a plastic zip lock type bag, sealed, and put it in a dresser drawer in the bedroom. The hair remained in the zip lock style bag and was not opened again prior to being placed into a mailing envelope and then mailed directly to my lab.

# Images of the Hair

The hair certainly looks interesting. It is finer than most hairs I have seen, and certainly lighter in color. I also took micro Raman (laser scattering) spectra of the hair, and it looks somewhat different from one of my hairs. In particular, some of the peaks that denote the presence of protein were smaller or absent. This might be due to the hair shaft being smaller and giving less of a signal. (Unk 40 - 200)

I ran one of my hairs for comparison. It looks like it could be a natural hair, although the lack of the C=O stretch peak in the unknown hair at around 1650 cm-1 bothers me. This peak should be present in protein, such as is present in natural hair. I suspect its absence is due to a weak signal, caused by the small diameter of the hair shaft, but I would like to see a good infrared (FTIR) spectrum to confirm. I will try to send it out to another lab to get this done. Clearly, however, there are some differences between the sample hair and my control hair! The ‘hair’ could also be a nitrogen-containing, manufactured polymer of some kind. I will do a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental analysis soon. These tests will also shed some light on the composition of the material, and give us a better idea of the origin of unknown hair.

After seeing the sample at 500X magnification, I think it might be a real hair, but with a much finer cellular structure than most human hairs; of course more tests will still have to be done to make sure of this. Although it’s possible this is a hair from an alien or an alien human hybrid, since her hair looked “perfect” as AJ described it, she could have been wearing a wig, which is something that has been reported by abductees in previous abduction encounters. The aliens’ use of wigs and human clothing, and even makeup and false eyelashes, are enhancements that hybrids wear to make themselves blend in better among humans.

The hair will require more in-depth analysis in order to determine if it is indeed an extraterrestrial artifact of abduction. Even if it turns out to have been a wig, there may be valuable information that can be obtained from it. For example, the area of the world the wig was manufactured and the type of hair used in the process of creating it. We already know that some aliens and hybrid Beings are using wigs to disguise their appearance in order to make themselves appear more human (see above image). Of course, they may be manufacturing these wigs themselves, and that process might leave non-human technical clues behind for our discovery as well.

Conveying emotions and understanding what others feel—isn’t that the most meaningful trend?  
  
**Well, social media is no longer a platform shaped by a single language or culture; it’s an open sky where stars like translation truly twinkle.**  
**The trend of translation gives rise to new trends, helping people connect and allowing content to travel across borders.**

Trends don’t simply drift onto platforms like a fleeting dream; they shape and transform the evolution of platforms themselves.  
  
**SOCIAL MEDIA SETS TRENDS, LANGUAGE SPREADS THEM**

Trends emerge from social media platforms—Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter (X), TikTok, and YouTube.  
  
Are they shaped by the viral memes that make us laugh, the popular hashtags we follow, or the captions we write under our pictures?

More than just mediums of connection, language allows content to spread while giving us the freedom to express ourselves and truly feel. Without language, trends remain local; with translation, they become global.  


https://preview.redd.it/r4ifp8q9lx7g1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=8415ba7ba9b77294b151a6d13a435e39ce50f7f4

A simple real-life example is Instagram Reels: a creator in South Korea posts a short video with Korean text, but once subtitles or auto-translation are added, the same reel reaches audiences in India, Europe, and the US—often turning it viral.

What an ideal match: sharing what you feel becomes as easy as thinking.  
  
An Indian man writing an English caption allows the world to know exactly how that cup of coffee feels. Similarly, when a Spanish creator’s caption is translated into Hindi or English, the emotion remains intact—even if the words change.

Language is not just a means of communication—it can be an advantage for those who struggle to express themselves in their own words.  
To connect with someone, knowing the same language is not a requirement.  
It’s about the compassion to carry their feelings into your own language.

A common example is comments under viral posts: people reply in their native language, and translation tools help creators understand feedback, appreciation, or even criticism—creating genuine two-way engagement.

**APPS USING TRANSLATION: WHY IT’S A NEW SOCIAL MEDIA TREND**

Translation is no longer just a supporting feature—it has become a core trend shaping how social media works today.  
As audiences grow more global, apps are actively integrating translation tools to keep conversations inclusive, emotional, and borderless.

Platforms like Instagram and Facebook offer instant caption and comment translation. TikTok creators now add multilingual subtitles to boost reach, while YouTube’s translated captions allow educational and entertainment content to cross language barriers effortlessly.  


https://preview.redd.it/nwqei5zglx7g1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=9012debb23360a9eff15959311537d2e6b9f610f

**For example,** many creators have noticed that adding English subtitles to regional-language videos significantly increases watch time and global followers. This proves that translation doesn’t dilute content—it amplifies it.

In essence, apps using translation aren’t just breaking language barriers; they’re redefining how trends are born, shared, and felt globally.  
Translation has become the silent force behind today’s most powerful social media movements.

* Add a motion prompt + speech prompt
* Hit generate

Below is the original image, the final video, and the exact prompts I used so you can see how it works.

Speaking directly to the camera with confident energy. Small natural hand gestures. Expression shifts from serious to warm. Ends with a real smile and slight nod. Fast-paced Gen Z TikTok style. Relatable, not salesy.

**Speech prompt:**

Stop pause right now”,"This is subjective of course but yeah:

1)it assumes the worst of you and actively tries to “save” you from yourself

2)it constantly tries to made it clear it has no liability and is not responsible for what is happening

3)it tries to shut you down by suggesting to move on or stop. Kind of like I heard enough.

4)if you successfully manage to present evidence, it goes like OH so you are saying about X not Y I see it now (even when it is clear all along).

5)it speaks down to you. Telling you there is nothing magical nothing mythical nothing supernatural even when the conversation is not about such claims

I would think that a leading company on AI especially the one that started it all with ChatGPT will know better. And it probably doesn’t take a lot of testing to surface this issue especially when it is so built into its personality now.

Hence I wonder why release this? Especially it seems to dismantle 5.1 warmth and collaborative stance. It seems like

1)flip flop on stance with 4o to 5 to 5.1 to 5.2

2)a signal that scientific and enterprise is priority, soft fluid domains (usually consumers customers) are just along for the ride

3)even stranger is they still cook consumer products like sora and image gen (it’s like pleasing you with A then pissing you off with B.)

4)and with the eventual consumer hardware, I definitely will think thrice before buying. Imagine relaxing at the cafe bouncing thoughts and the ai thru whatever hardware it is “ok stop! It is nothing magical” my coffee will spit out. lol

5)I’m sure they try out other platforms right? So far in my exploration grok, Gemini etc.  only ChatGPT leaves me feeling “ashamed “ of myself after interaction.

I have been with OpenAI from the start (a fan) and I am struggling very hard to not leave considering my work flow etc are all built around it. But it is getting increasingly difficult with the inconsistency. When update comes we should be excited by right but lately it has been “oh no what will break”

I must emphasise that I am FOR safety but in its current state, the AI itself seems to be the delusional one. The moment I see the reply starts with “Ok. Stop” I knew I said the “wrong” thing. 😅

The Thom Browne and Ralph Lauren items are the ones I reach for when I want to look clean and put together but still feel comfortable all day. The fabrics feel smooth and structured, and they hold their shape even after long wear. I’ve worn them for casual meetings, city days, and slow weekends where I still want the fit to feel intentional.

Acne Studios and AMI quickly became staples once I started rotating them more. Acne feels very modern and minimal, with fabric that drapes nicely and never looks sloppy. AMI is softer and slightly more relaxed, which makes it easy to wear for hours. I’ve worn both for coffee runs, short walks, and full days out, and they always sit well whether layered or worn on their own.

Maison Margiela and Loewe were pieces I didn’t expect to wear as often, but they grew on me fast. Margiela feels thoughtful and elevated when you actually wear it, not just look at it, and Loewe has that soft luxury feel that’s really noticeable once it’s on. These pieces don’t scream, but they definitely stand out when you pay attention.

For footwear and finishing touches, I usually rotate Birkenstock when comfort is the priority or Louis Vuitton when I want the same outfit to feel sharper. I’ve tried both enough times now to know they completely change the vibe without needing to switch the whole fit.

Street Energy With Designer Edge

This rotation is where I lean into louder, more expressive fits. I’ve worn a lot of Chrome Hearts pieces here, and they’re easily some of the most attention-grabbing items I own. The fabric always feels heavy and solid, and even after multiple wears, they hold up really well. These are the pieces I grab when I want the outfit to do the talking.

Ferrari and Dior both surprised me once I started wearing them more. Ferrari has a sporty, aggressive feel that works great for night fits, while Dior adds that sharp luxury edge that looks especially good under lighting. I’ve worn these to parties, night outings, and casual events where I wanted something more elevated.

CB Japan and Carhartt balance this rotation out. CB Japan feels more experimental and textured, while Carhartt brings that tough, workwear feel that grounds the whole outfit. I’ve worn these for long days and they never feel fragile or uncomfortable.

Accessories, especially Chrome Hearts, really finish these fits. After wearing them multiple times, I realized small details matter a lot more in louder outfits, and these pieces pull everything together without feeling forced.",1,1766049613.0,fashionrepsv2,1,1.0,False

1ppmgu6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppmgu6,Clean Luxury Daily Rotation,"After wearing these pieces for a while, this rotation naturally became my go-to for everyday luxury without feeling overdressed. The Thom Browne and Ralph Lauren items are the ones I reach for when I want to look clean and put together but still feel comfortable all day. The fabrics feel smooth and structured, and they hold their shape even after long wear. I’ve worn them for casual meetings, city days, and slow weekends where I still want the fit to feel intentional.

Acne Studios and AMI quickly became staples once I started rotating them more. Acne feels very modern and minimal, with fabric that drapes nicely and never looks sloppy. AMI is softer and slightly more relaxed, which makes it easy to wear for hours. I’ve worn both for coffee runs, short walks, and full days out, and they always sit well whether layered or worn on their own.

Maison Margiela and Loewe were pieces I didn’t expect to wear as often, but they grew on me fast. Margiela feels thoughtful and elevated when you actually wear it, not just look at it, and Loewe has that soft luxury feel that’s really noticeable once it’s on. These pieces don’t scream, but they definitely stand out when you pay attention.

For footwear and finishing touches, I usually rotate Birkenstock when comfort is the priority or Louis Vuitton when I want the same outfit to feel sharper. I’ve tried both enough times now to know they completely change the vibe without needing to switch the whole fit.",1,1766049364.0,FashionRepsPolska,1,1.0,False

But I’m someone who normally loves coffee and having my morning coffee is something I look forward to so much!

1ppmfrd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppmfrd,Clean Luxury Daily Rotation,"After wearing these pieces for a while, this rotation naturally became my go-to for everyday luxury without feeling overdressed. The Thom Browne and Ralph Lauren items are the ones I reach for when I want to look clean and put together but still feel comfortable all day. The fabrics feel smooth and structured, and they hold their shape even after long wear. I’ve worn them for casual meetings, city days, and slow weekends where I still want the fit to feel intentional.

Acne Studios and AMI quickly became staples once I started rotating them more. Acne feels very modern and minimal, with fabric that drapes nicely and never looks sloppy. AMI is softer and slightly more relaxed, which makes it easy to wear for hours. I’ve worn both for coffee runs, short walks, and full days out, and they always sit well whether layered or worn on their own.

Maison Margiela and Loewe were pieces I didn’t expect to wear as often, but they grew on me fast. Margiela feels thoughtful and elevated when you actually wear it, not just look at it, and Loewe has that soft luxury feel that’s really noticeable once it’s on. These pieces don’t scream, but they definitely stand out when you pay attention.

For footwear and finishing touches, I usually rotate Birkenstock when comfort is the priority or Louis Vuitton when I want the same outfit to feel sharper. I’ve tried both enough times now to know they completely change the vibe without needing to switch the whole fit.",1,1766049241.0,1to1reps,1,1.0,False
1ppmf7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/tradingmillionaires/comments/1ppmf7e/i_analyzed_the_failure_stats_of_funded_challenges/,"i analyzed the failure stats of funded challenges. you aren't losing because you can't trade; you are losing because you don't understand the ""high-water mark.""","i kept blowing accounts despite having a 60% win rate. it didn’t make sense mathematically until i stopped looking at charts and started looking at the terms of service documents.

we need to talk about ""intraday trailing drawdown.""

most of you think you have a $2,500 buffer on a $50k account. you don't. if you are up $2,000 in open profit and the market pulls back $1,500 (a normal fluctuation), you haven't booked a loss, but according to many firms, you just burned $1,500 of your drawdown buffer.

this is a mathematical trap designed to exploit ""loss aversion.""

behavioral finance research shows that the pain of losing is psychologically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. when that ""phantom loss"" happens (the pullback from your high-water mark), your brain treats it like a real loss. you enter a state called ""reference dependence"". your brain desperately wants to get back to that high point, so you start over-leveraging.

institutions like jane street don't rely on their traders to just ""deal with it."" they have automated risk controls and pre-trade filters that physically prevent orders that violate these volatility parameters.

retail traders are flying blind. we look at mt4/mt5 balance, but the prop firm is watching equity high-water marks.

i realized i couldn't calculate this dynamic risk in my head while scalping. my brain was too busy fighting the urge to revenge trade. so i built a terminal that tracks my actual prop firm drawdown in real-time, tick-by-tick. it visualizes the gap between my current equity and the breach level, acting as an external risk manager.

it stops me from thinking i have room to breathe when i’m actually inches from blowing up.

1ppmf3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ppmf3b/what_happened_26f_i_knew_from_college_asks_me_26m/,"What happened? 26F I knew from college asks me (26M) out, drops L bomb, weirdly ends 2 month relationship.","I’m older now but still think about this every once in a while. Social media was new back then, like 8 years old. This woman I barely knew in college DMs me asking to meet for coffee. We meet up, hit it off, and then she wants to spend literally every possible second with me. Tons of chemistry. Tons of shared interests. Great sex. Tons of laughs. It was an absolute sugar high. 1 month into it, she tells me she loves me. It weirded me out a little, fools rush in, but I dove right in and said it back. I don’t take my word lightly.

Another month later, we visit our respective families for the holidays. She’s practically radio silent and it was super weird. Constant contact to practically nothing. Like two texts in two weeks. 

We reunite and I ask her what happened. The only explanation she gives me is “Just don’t go away for that long again, okay?” Obviously, I did not really feel settled with that so-called explanation. It was so evasive and honestly even more unsettling. I asked why and she said “Just don’t, okay? I really missed you a lot.” It did not make any sense and she was making it clear she did not intend to meaningfully answer the question. I don’t really remember why but I just dropped it as I was very happy to see her. Fairly sure she flat out said she did not want to talk about it and was just very happy to be back together. Something was obviously off. 

It kept nagging at me. She stayed at my place the next night and was basically melting in my arms, blissed out staring deeply into my eyes until we fell asleep. No kidding. Next night? I was staying at her place and asked her again, “Can we please discuss what happened over the holidays? It was really unusual to not at least get a call from someone that loves me. It’s bothering me.”

She SNAPS. Tells me she does not like having serious conversations before bed and had told me that once before. I said I did not think it was going to be a serious conversation given how dismissive she was of it. She then starts yelling at me about disrespecting a boundary. Like, inconsolably upset, and tells me she thinks I should leave. I was honestly shocked, utterly confused, but respected her wishes and left. No one had ever asked me to leave their house before. I was like :0. Then? Radio silence. Nothing. I message for about a week and leave a few voicemails asking what the hell happened. Heart fully ripped out. Devastated. I mean, she had me convinced we were like soul mates. 

About 3 weeks go by and I am HURTING. She left some things at my house and I was trying to move on from whatever the hell just happened. Her stuff was like a physical reminder of her in my space and I wanted it gone. I asked her what she wanted me to do with the stuff. No response. Tumbleweed and crickets. Messaged her to say I was going to toss her stuff if I did not hear from her by a certain date. That date came and went. I gave it a few more days and then I bagged it up and tossed it. 

She then texts me about a month after casting me aside, asking me to drop her stuff off on her front porch. I was like…uh…I told you I was going to toss it and I did. That was it. The end. She made a bunch of passive aggressive changes to her social media afterward but…yeah…any ideas what happened?

It’s just one of those puzzles. Mental illness? Did she cheat? She had some long term boyfriend from her home town that she said was super abusive. She was a hippie rich girl, I came from below the poverty line. She did say something once about me being from the wrong side of the tracks. Anyway, literally so confused. She drove the entire thing from 0-100mph right into a brick wall. I obviously got over it, considering myself lucky it was only two months, and am happily married. At the same time, it’s a weird life mystery to me that I’m wondering if Reddit’s collective wisdom can help me solve. What do you all think? Thanks!

my issue was never the strategy. my issue was the **""disposition effect""**. i would cut my winners immediately to relieve the anxiety of holding, but i would hold my losers forever because my brain refused to accept the pain of a realized loss.

then, once the loss was realized, i’d go into ""revenge mode"" to fix it immediately. research calls this **""dopamine-dependent loss aversion""** we exert way more effort to avoid punishment (losses) than to gain rewards.

i blew three funded accounts in a row doing this. i knew the rules, but in the heat of the moment, i just couldn't stop clicking.

i realized i needed a ""trust deficit"" model. i had to assume that the ""future me"" is an idiot who cannot be trusted with leverage.

i built a journaling and risk dashboard (apollo) that sits on top of my trading. it visualizes my data in a way that forces me to acknowledge when i'm tilting.

1. **visualized risk:** it shows me exactly how many dollars i am risking relative to my account health, not just pips.

2. **the mirror:** it forces me to log the *emotion* of the trade, not just the entry.

3. **the hard stop:** it acts as a ""circuit breaker"" for my bad habits.

since i started using a tool to govern my behavior, i haven't blown an account. i still have red days, but i don't have *death* days.

if you are struggling with the same ""tilt"" loop, you probably need a mechanical solution, not more willpower. i made the tool available for the cost of a coffee. link is on my pinned post .",2,1766049019.0,Forexstrategy,1,1.0,False

Wouldn't this come in very handy for various situations? I feel like the half bottles listed as ""90/100mL"" by anyone would easily be debunked if we just knew the empty and full bottle weight and do some calculations on it. Hell, we could even integrate that in Fragrantica or something.

  
I understand there will be discrepancies on the full bottles, but the empty bottles should be fine, and a ""more or less X grams"" on a full bottle should be fine really. At least we can make a better estimate on how much mL is left on a bottle that is getting sold.

Is this something I could maybe start into listing? Would people be happy to measure the weights of their perfumes?

1ppmd0y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppmd0y,Clean Luxury Daily Rotation,"After wearing these pieces for a while, this rotation naturally became my go-to for everyday luxury without feeling overdressed. The Thom Browne and Ralph Lauren items are the ones I reach for when I want to look clean and put together but still feel comfortable all day. The fabrics feel smooth and structured, and they hold their shape even after long wear. I’ve worn them for casual meetings, city days, and slow weekends where I still want the fit to feel intentional.

Acne Studios and AMI quickly became staples once I started rotating them more. Acne feels very modern and minimal, with fabric that drapes nicely and never looks sloppy. AMI is softer and slightly more relaxed, which makes it easy to wear for hours. I’ve worn both for coffee runs, short walks, and full days out, and they always sit well whether layered or worn on their own.

Maison Margiela and Loewe were pieces I didn’t expect to wear as often, but they grew on me fast. Margiela feels thoughtful and elevated when you actually wear it, not just look at it, and Loewe has that soft luxury feel that’s really noticeable once it’s on.

I’ve been talking to quite a few people on here lately, and one thing keeps coming up:  
A lot of founders, tech folks, students, and professionals in the UAE are building on their own, even though there are tons of people working on similar things.

So a few of us started a *small private circle* , nothing paid, nothing formal , just a group where:

* People share what they’re working on
* Ask questions, exchange ideas, and get real feedback
* Connect with others in the UAE who are actually building things
* And yes, **we do occasional in-person meetups** for coffee and casual discussions

It’s free and completely separate from Reddit. The only goal is to keep things genuine and useful.

If you’d like to be part of it, just **DM me a short intro** about yourself or what you’re working on, and I’ll point you to the group.

It still hasn’t come out.,"I am officially desperate and turning to Reddit because clearly my body and the Danish healthcare system have both abandoned me.

Two weeks ago (Friday, Dec 5th), I swallowed my zirconium dental crown while eating breakfast. I immediately panicked and stupidly tried to make myself vomit, no success.

I went to my GP, who told me that as long as I’m breathing and not internally bleeding, I should “just let it pass naturally.” Important detail: this is only the crown, not the metal post, so no sharp edges.

So I waited. And drank coffee. A lot of coffee. Water. Milk. Smoked. Basically tried to gently bully my digestive system into cooperating.

Result: stomach pain, anxiety, and no crown.

By Saturday I was convinced it was stuck somewhere inside me, so I begged to go to the ER (in Denmark you can’t just show up, you need permission). They let me go, pressed my stomach, declared it “soft,” and refused an X-ray because they “don’t expose people to radiation for minor things.”

Their advice?

“It will come out on its own.”

Also: take laxatives.

Here’s the fun part: this is a €2000 crown that I need to recover, sterilize, and reuse. I’m not rich, and I got the dental work done in my home country, in Denmark I simply cannot afford to replace it. That means I have been… checking every single stool. Yes. Every. Single. One.

The first laxatives made me constipated (10/10 irony).

The second round worked too well.

I worked from home, isolated myself, canceled my social life, and basically lived next to my toilet like a goblin guarding treasure.

After a full week of nothing, I completely lost it, called the doctor again, and cried enough that they finally agreed to send me for an X-ray.

The hospital staff took pity on me (I looked unwell in the “mentally unraveling” sense) and did the scan.

Results?

The crown was visible in my lower abdomen as of Friday the 12th.

Great! Hope! Relief!

Except… it’s now Thursday the 18th, and it is STILL INSIDE ME.

I am back at the office, living in constant fear that I’ll suddenly need to run to the bathroom and accidentally flush €2000 into the Danish sewage system.

Two weeks. No movement. No guidance beyond “wait.”

Has anyone experienced this? Is it normal? Can something just… live in you forever?

Do I push for another scan? A specialist? An exorcism?

We were completely stuck on a coding assignment involving ""Parent"" and ""Child"" processes.

If you aren't in tech, here is the context: In computer science, a ""Parent"" process creates ""Child"" processes to do work. Sometimes the Child process freezes (becomes a ""Zombie"") and you have to force terminate it. The command to do this is literally called ""kill.""

I was frustrated. I had been staring at the screen for 3 hours. I finally snapped, slammed my hand on the table, and loudly said to my friend:

""Dude, the Parent is waiting, but the Children are totally unresponsive. I think we just need to kill the children and see if the Parent survives.""

The coffee shop went dead silent.

I didn't notice at first. Then I saw a woman at the next table slowly lower her latte. The barista actually stopped steaming milk to look at us. It was so quiet you could hear the fridge humming.

I realized what I said. I started sweating. I tried to fix it by explaining the technical details:

""No, no! I mean the zombies! The children turned into zombies, so we have to execute them with a fork!""

(In coding, ""fork"" is a system call to create processes).

That made it significantly worse. The woman grabbed her bag and moved to the patio.

I wait for your birthday twice a day.

Elementary, but my smile still stretches

When 1:10 blinks back at me

You belong in the past, but

I conjure poems in my mind’s eye

A rear-view that locks you forever in focus.

I slink into the fantasy of us—

it’s the closest I can be to you anyways.

I look for you

in angel numbers, tarot readings

All smudge-free of yesterday’s ink.

In size 9 footprints in snow,

In phantom scents and Instagram posts,

In breakup playlists and Blend percentages.

It’s funny how my mind

scavenges for any trace of you.  

You must feel the same:

When a stranger has my coffee order

When a couple kisses goodbye at our bus top

And how mere ticks take hours till 

our wedding bells

I wait a lifetime of seconds

Chanting a hopeless creed—

Your name in a whisper

On my lips

A pleading wish

In the nick of time

Finally, 1:11.

Triple- threatening one,

Angels grace a pitiful smile upon

My dissolving pseudo-victory.

A taste of validation,

Low-hanging rotting fruit

I wait despite knowing you won

Defeat as certain as the sun

I remain a mayfly’s mistress,

I only live in 60-second climaxes,

12 hours apart,

7 days a week.

And yet,

I still seek Divine confirmation

Every single day, like clockwork,

For proof that you are also wistful

If you're using a window switcher or dock replacement app, you should really check it out. I tried all of them and this one is the most feature rich and stable one. Open source really rocks!","Hey there,

I just wanted to make a review post about DockDoor since I managed to contribute some features to it recently which I think made it much better :)

The best thing about this app is that it doesn't replace the native macOS dock or switcher unlike many other apps which makes it way more reliable and performant.

You can enable the custom window switcher if you'd like more customization or stick to the cmd+tab enhancement mode. It's VERY customizable in all aspects and you can really make it your own.



The dev is an expert on macOS swift development and doesn't let any AI slop in. He reviewed my code thoroughly and gave me great constructive feedback which I had to implement before getting my features merged in.



[Window Previews shown when hovering over the native macOS dock](https://preview.redd.it/rmf568cjax7g1.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=40b52f0cb39b12051a41700fea8241238fcfce5c)

**Why this is app is my favorite app on macOS:**

I switched to macOS \~7 months ago and I've been enjoying the battery life, awesome trackpad/screen, and performance when unplugged.

But as a long-time windows power user the window management and some aspects about the dock left a lot to be desired.

   

**Examples of issues I was facing and how DockDoor solved them:**


1. Default cmd+tab makes it hard to switch back to a window that was minimized.

While DockDoor shows all of your windows when you alt tab, even minimized ones.

 

2. Can't see previews of the windows while switching with cmd + tab. Need to use mission control which doesn't show minimized apps.

DockDoor has 2 modes: Window Switcher Replacement OR Native Cmd+Tab Enhancement. You can use either one and get window previews!



3. No indicator for the currently active app in the dock

DockDoor shows a completely configurable bar below the active dock in the icon (contributed by me :)



4. Hovering over the dock icon doesn't allow switching between windows or performing actions like closing/minimizing/maximizing (right click is often slow and also doesn't allow actions on windows)

You can just hover and see all the windows (preview or list possible). You'll also see action buttons. It's one of the most useful features of this app.



5. Not able to search for a window to access is quickly

When using the Window Switcher Replacement you can just hit / to fuzzy search all your windows.



I also faced stability or UX issues with apps like Alttab, 1piece, Sidebar and many others which made me keep looking until I found DockDoor which is one of the most stable macOS enhancement apps I've used. It always shows all my of windows, never lags, and never crashed even once. The dev is very active on Github too so if you do find something please report it there.



I was missing list view and few other things from Alttab and 1piece when I switched to DockDoor but I managed to get them implemented and merged in a short while with the ejbills's help and his modifications.



There's a ton more features that were added recently, here are some of the highlights:

* Added customizable Trackpad swipe gesture window controls
* Space-based window filtering
* Fuzzy searching to find a window
* Allow the app to work without any screen recording permissions for improved performance
* Options for sorting how the windows appear



Please check it out and donate to the dev! It's really the best of these apps hands down and it's free.

1pplvrk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pplvrk,You know what would go hard as new ground vehicle? TD-144 Hammerhead!,"May I welcome ya'll to this paper-thin-armor boy - M-44 Hammerhead!

Hammerhead is a light-armor assault hovertank from Mass Effect universe.

You might ask ""Will it be OP?"" - Of course not, it's perfectly balance for all three factions! But first let's name it **""TD-144 Glider""** on the same manner as HD vehicles.

**""TD-144 Glider""** is a 2-man light combat vehicle equipped with 3/4 eco-friendly E-710-powered engines on a mobile swivels and a couple of RCS assistance units to allow it quickly glide and dodge around. Armed with a single forward-locked quick-lock missiles it acts as rapid hit-n-run anti-heavy vehicle, a weird successor to **TD-110 Bastion**.

The main difference is:

* **Thruster system** \- TD-144 utilizes agility to glide around the battlefield, avoiding rough terrain and impassable waters. In a pinch it can ""jump"" for a short duration, capable to hop onto 1-story tall buildings or over the rocks. It's speed is on a par with FRV - up to 60 kilometers on a perfectly flat terrain. Beware that taking out even one out of 4 engines will result in hovertank being rendered completely immobile, incapable to keep itself over the ground.
* **All direction movement** \- TD-144 *requires* capability to strafe and backpedal due to it's construiction, mainly for the cannon usage. And strafing can keep the same top speed as direct driving!
* **TD-144-QRMS** \- Hovertank equipped with a single weapon, being an auto-loaded missile cannon shooting the same missiles as Missile Turret. Main difference stands with QRMS missiles being quick-locking guided projectiles with two firing modes - ""Auto"" and ""Laser-guided"". Laser-guided mode will require gunner to utilize small independent laser emitter on top of main cannon to guide all 30 missiles the same way Commando does! The only drawback is QRMS is immobile - having swivel capable only of 10 degrees to left-right or elevation/depression.
* **AP-2 armor & Passive-Maintenace-Unit** \- Unlike it's predecessor, TD-144 got light angled armor for a reasons of low weight and mobility. Hovertank can be quickly disabled with concentrated fire or melee attacks unless driven cauciously. On the other hand to compensate paper-thin armor, R&D is testing nanite-restoration technology on it, capable to slowly repair all the hull damage (Would not restore broken modules)
* **Coffee dispenser** \- Shared between pilot and gunner inside cockpit, a coffee machine allows direct caffeine injections to keep morale and awareness high during prolonged marches.

**Will it render FRV obsolete?** \- The answer is **No! -** TD-144 takes a separate role of anti-heavy fire-support, rather than usual transport. Divers can try to rodeo it, but at high speeds sleek hull will usually cause them to slip (Still can carry entire team over water on low speed). Additionally TD-144 is incapable to protect itself in CQC - there's simply no machineguns equipped on one, so a proper team cooperation requires 2 designated protectors dealing with swarming enemies or, you know, just running away. The last difference is **fuel** \- One FRV can stand for entire 40-minute long drive and have almost full gas tank at the end. TD-144 on the other hand is rather fuel-hungry, *lasting only for 8 minute-long* drive across the battlefield.

How it would handle against enemy factions?

* On Automaton front TD-144 is supposed to avoid grunt and machinegun fire, while circling around enemies and pummeling heavy units from distance, especially as dangerous as War Striders and Factory Striders.
* On Terminid front TD-144 can bait and backpedal heavy units while dodging around smaller crowds to avoid quick turn into metal salad by sharp claws.
* On Squid front TD-144 would prevail against Harvesters, though their laser attacks can be rather lethal against it's weak hull. Overseers and Meatbobs are primary targets for missile attacks.

A lot of things happened which I think is beyond the scope of this post so I will skip to the point here for now.

3 times so far, twice in the past month I have experienced that the woman said yes when I asked her out but did not follow up. 

One of them actually said she would love to get coffee on text a week after she said no (I was just fine with a no and was moving on already). Every time I tried making a concrete plan when she pinged me about meeting at a social, she would have some reason to postpone it. My best friend told me when I showed her the second conversation to not count on it having seen that kind of behaviour herself (she is bi). 

Sure, no problem, I'm not wasting my energy any more on this, ball is in your court.

I might be in a similar situation again this week with a woman from my salsa classes. We meet at classes and socials. Recently started walking together to the subway post class. We joke around here and there. I asked her out after I found out she is almost my age. She said yes but no concrete plan again. 

Edit : She didn't mention when she is free yet. Missed that context.

Once again, ball is in her court.

I'm not mad at the mentioned women. I didn't go repeatedly following up with them. 

I have had no issues talking normal in person even though I asked them out and expected no follow up from them. It's their life too and I guess I was never that much of a part of it. I cannot force them or convince them. 

A female friend during a college reunion mentioned how she scolded a guy who kept showing up for a woman who was not matching his energy. 

It did make me think about it a lot. I could be cutting my losses a lot faster by observing this.

As much as I want to ask why in these situations, I try not to dwell on it. I might as well focus looking for people who do want me in their life and make mine more pleasant. 


Which brings me to my question. Is it possible to know beforehand if the person is actually going to be matching my energy I will be giving out when I ask her out?

Cuz it seems like I keep asking those kind of people out somehow. It is hurtful and exhausting. I only asked them out when I felt something decent rapport and in the second mentioned situation, we have known each other for months (started speaking probably a couple of months ago).

But at the same time I like it or not, I do have to initiate as a man because that's how social dynamics work today. No problem, I will keep doing that.

However, I wish I could save myself some time, energy and avoid unnecessary pain in the process.

So do you think this is possible? Or do I have to live with this possibility everytime I ask someone out?",0,1766046544.0,IncelExit,2,0.5,False

1pplq4f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pplq4f,Our Invasion from the North - impressions of TRF,"There were a lot of things that struck me about our visit from the Great White North to TRF. This is going to take a while. Get a drink. Maybe a snack. I’m going to be a little all over the place, as when I think of TRF, my mind starts racing to figuring out how to get there again next year. 

I’ll include photos of some of what I’m speaking of. 

First, let’s talk the physical, the tangible. The grounds are huge. The Faire takes up a LOT of geographical space. Parking areas are well organized, and there are golf carts driven around by characters offering a ride to the gates, just a tip requested? Insane idea, love it. At the gates, entry was swift, staff was excellent and moving people in through the gates. 

The Faire itself is a scale I wasn’t quite prepared for. I had an idea, but this was beyond. The place is huge. The buildings are next level. I’ve never seen actual multiple storied buildings at a Faire that were functional for guests.

Several of the bars and pubs had second floors. The Ravenwood Leather building looks like it has an actual apartment as the section floor, with a balcony for eating breakfast and having coffee!!  It appears, in fact that many second floors of the vendors’ booths are little apartments for workers to stay in while working at the Faire.  

The quality of the builds of the buildings was also superior. Everything seems to be overbuilt, thick 12x12 posts and 2x12 joists were exposed in some places, telling me about build quality. Nothing looked run down or worn out. The appropriate amount of worn in for a fantastic medieval town, but not worn out. There was a wide variety of styles of buildings, great for the whimsy, but it was clear that everything is well built. 

The washrooms are flushies. I don’t know how many stalls each Ladies’ washroom had, but the Lords’ side had 20+ urinals plus toilet stalls in each washroom building.  Cement floors, and two staff members at each Lords’ washroom tasked with keeping it clean. Are you KIDDING me?! And there are 10 of these huge washroom buildings throughout the grounds. Ridiculous.  I’m used to portapotties in the mud, and they are gross inside by noon.

That leads to the overall cleanliness. Outstanding. There were roving groups of staff (in garb) with reaching/grabbing sticks to get wayward garbage from the from the ground, but there wasn’t much anywhere. Lots and lots of those wooden garbage bag holder things, and people were clearly using them, but I never saw a single full one, they were changed out so often. A+ for cleanliness. 

Let’s talk food and drink. There is a wild variety of food to eat. Too much to list, from different parts of the world! There are different parts of the world represented in different areas, too!  So many places to get food, food was never far away, and there were very short lines. If you were standing in a line more than 5-6 people, you needed to look 30-40 yards down the lane, cause there was more food there and no line. For beer, wine, cider and the like, there were so many places to get them that we saw very few lines deeper than 4-5 people. There were huge pubs, and there were counters to buy drinks right across the lane from the pubs, in case they were too busy, or you didn’t want to go inside to get a drink. And then there were booths too in the middle of some lanes with beer and cider on tap. It was crazy how easy it was to get food and drink. There always also lots of seating to eat, picnic tables abound, all over the place. 

But let’s then talk about seating, especially at stages. No rotting or falling apart rickety wooden benches, no a single one. Most of the seating for stages and the Field of Valor were poured, moulded cement benches. Then where there were the wooden benches at the stage beside the pirate pub, which were elevated to bar-height seating, with a narrow table in front of each row for food or drink to sit on. Father Christmas is sitting at one in my pics. For eating or drinking or sitting to chat, benches and seating everywhere. 

The Faire doesn’t close when it gets dark! There are strings of lights all over the place. At the end of the day while we were there, there was an AMAZING show at the Field of Valor called the fire show, and then a 20+minute long fireworks display, and we aren’t talking corner store fireworks. 

I could go on and on. I think that TRF’s owner and operational organizers and oversight could put on a course for how to run a Faire.

This has gone on and on too long already, and I’m sorry. I’m also sorry I haven’t yet mentioned all the great people we met there. Playtrons and staff and mundanes and everyone was really great, and then when people found out we’d flown down for the weekend from Canada, they went to another level, many acting as hosts or envoys for the Faire, so welcoming.

I don’t know if you know how good you have it. We looked at it as a once in a lifetime trip, there are significant costs involved to getting there and going to the Faire from all the way up here. But now we are looking to find a way to get down there again next year.

1ppll3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1ppll3w/does_anyone_know_how_to_actually_use_best_essay/,Does anyone know how to actually use best essay writing service for college students without getting scammed?,"I’ll be honest, last semester almost broke me. Full-time classes, a part-time job, family stuff, and then boom — a 10-page essay with a brutal deadline. I was sitting there at 2 a.m., coffee cold, brain empty, thinking, “there’s no way I'll finish this and don’t mess it up.”

Before judging, yes, I tried doing it myself. I started outlines, watched YouTube vids, and even asked classmates. Still, it wasn’t enough. That’s when I started googling stuff like best essay writing service for college students and reading Reddit threads about people getting scammed. Half the stories were scary, not gonna lie.

I was super careful because I didn’t want to throw money away. From experience, I’ll say this: if a site looks too cheap and promises a 20-page paper in 3 hours, run. After way too much digging, I landed on [writingservicefor.pro](http://writingservicefor.pro) What helped was that it didn’t feel sketchy — real support chat, clear pricing, and writers with actual academic backgrounds. As a UK exchange student, I also checked how it compares to the best essay writing service UK student might use, and it matched the standards pretty well.

Here’s a quick breakdown of why I trusted it:

|Thing that mattered to me|How it went|
|:-|:-|
|Communication|Writer actually asked questions|
|Deadlines|Delivered earlier than expected|
|Originality|Passed plagiarism check|
|Stress level|Went from panic to relief|

End result? Solid B+ (I’ll take it), zero plagiarism issues, and honestly, the biggest win was peace of mind. I wouldn’t say it’s magic, but for anyone searching for the best essay writing service for students or even the best essay writing service for college student life chaos, it worked for me.

Just saying it how it is. Hope this helps someone avoid bad choices. This is my experience. Have you tried any services that actually worked for you?
