Hi everyone, we’re landing in Bali in a few days and will be staying in Seminyak for the first few days then Gili T. We’re travelling with teenagers and would love a few basic local tips.

Looking for recommendations on
• the best grocery or convenience store to quickly grab snacks and coffee etc for the hotel room
• a good place to grab a decent cup of coffee nearby

Also open to any quick food and drink tips for first timers, things to avoid, or anything that makes settling in easier after a long flight.",1,1765923048.0,BaliTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. The cuffing season has me wishing for emotional warmth.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect. 

---

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone but I'm also a night owl.

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity. 
Someone who shows up. Someone I can be soft with, who wants to build something grounded and real, even if it’s imperfect. Maybe we find peace in each other’s chaos, or maybe we just help each other breathe a little easier in the process.

If this resonates, I’d love to hear from you, i really would. Tell me who you are when no one’s watching. Share a lyric that stayed with you, a thought that won’t leave, or just say hi. You deserve a cookie for reading all the way 🍪",1,1765922944.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1pof3qz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pof3qz,Reflections on a perfectly fine fanny pack,"A few years ago, I made a small fanny pack for my partner as a travel bag. Nothing fancy. I sketched it on cardstock, sewed two versions, and figured we’d use them on a trip and then move on.

That did not happen.

Two (three?) years later, her original bag is still in rotation every single day. It has been on planes, on hikes, through cities, into cafés, theaters, bars, and churches. It has been stuffed, underfilled, overfilled, spilled on, rained on, set down on questionable surfaces, lost once and found again, used, abused, ridden hard and put away wet, and generally treated the way a real piece of gear gets treated. No ceremony and no special care. Just use.

At some point it stopped being “a thing I made” and started being a thing that just existed. It shows up in reflections. In couples photos without being invited. Hanging by the door. Slung over a chair. Always already there.

That makes it, without question, the most heavily used piece of gear I’ve ever made. It is certainly showing its age at this point which, for function, seems to have made no difference at all.

There are coffee and booze stains worked into the lining now. A faint smell of sunscreen that never quite goes away. The zipper pull has been re-tied once or twice with whatever cord was nearby at the time. I’ve watched it get dumped out on bar tops, park benches, airport floors, and the tailgate of the car while someone searched for a lip balm or a parking ticket or something equally unimportant. It has been half-zipped in a rush, clipped on crooked, tossed onto the passenger seat, kicked under it, and retrieved again without so much as a complaint.

After a couple of years of that kind of use, I finally sat down and digitized the pattern and documented the hell out of the construction steps. Not because it needed improvement, but because it had already proven itself by being boring in the best way. It worked. And it kept working. Nothing clever broke. Nothing essential went missing.

I’ve shared the pattern for free now under the name Towpath Pack, named for the canal walks she and I love. Mostly because I like the idea of other people making a perfectly fine fanny pack and then forgetting about it because it’s doing its job.

Not every project needs to be precious. Some things just need to work.",6,1765922746.0,myog,0,1.0,False

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

So I (22F) and my boyfriend (21M) went on our first family trip with my aunt and grandma. We went to Orlando for 5 days and did one meetup/party at UO and Disney, this is important later. The first day we were there was fine completely. The 2nd day we went over to Disney Springs and wanted to participate in some resort hopping. This was my boyfriends first ever trip to Orlando where as we go semi-regularly so I wanted to be able to show him a bunch of stuff while also keeping my aunt and grandma included. We utilized the boats they have there and when we got back while walking up the ramp an older gentleman abruptly dropped his coffee and was collapsing. His wife was trying to hold him up but she was older too making it difficult. My boyfriend is a firefighter and former EMT, he immediately hopped into aiding the gentleman just to the ground. (After asking if the cast member would like assistance of course) We then waited till Disney's paramedics showed up and that was it, walked away once they got there. My aunt and grandma were waiting on the dock for us and as soon we reached them my grandma says ""You know you can be sued for that."" Not a question about if the gentleman was okay but immediately into liability concerns. My aunt reinforced this statement saying how he could ""be sued into the ground"" for just helping a gentleman get down. We already had mutually agreed prior to this incident that he and I were going to go back to the resort to enjoy the pools. As we were walking off we were discussing how it felt kinda out of pocket that their first concern was a lawsuit and not about the gentleman who we litterally watched fall. My boyfriend has a loud voice and I will say I did say some not so pleasant things about it. Well the next thing that occurs is my grandmother yelling my governmental name and my aunt getting up into my boyfriends face yelling at him. I will say again I did refer to their behavior as bitchy but he didn't really say anything other than it was really weird their concern was a lawsuit especially when they know his training. We brushed it off kept walking as they were continuing to yell things at us like being ""ungrateful."" We got into an uber and tried our best to smooth things over. Then we had our first meetup,  my aunt enjoys doing big rollercoasters I'm pretty hit or miss with them (big fear of heights) whereas my boyfriend is totally cool with all rides. Well this turned into my aunt demanding him to ride certain rides with her as she wouldn't do them alone. This led to him feeling like an object. They left us alone after she did the rides she wanted to do and it was pretty fun after but it definitely dampened the mood a little. The next day (day 3) they left us alone for most of the day as they had things they wanted to do together, which is fine. Day 4 rolls along and we have our Disney party that night. We get there and its fine, we're doing rides we wanna do together as Disney is a way more family orientated park which makes it easier to do more together. My grandma isn't big into rides at all but she'll do most of Disney. We get to HM and we somehow got lost with eachother. We thought they were in line just somewhere ahead of us so we waited and rode the ride, after we got off we didnt see them. I sent our group chat a text asking where they went. 30 minutes goes by and we get an answer, they just did 3 rides we mutually agreed on doing together. This kinda bummed us out a bit, especially when we did meet up with them and started getting told about how we just disappeared and they had no clue where we were. Even after explaining the HM mixup it didnt really get better. But again we tried to just let it roll by, did a couple things just the two of us and were with them the rest of the night. After this, it was super late (around 1:30am) when we got back to the hotel room. We ordered pizza, my boyfriend took 2 slices and so did I. ( we had 2 pizzas so plenty of slices) My boyfriend has some food issues, a case of a disappearing appetite/feeling like eating is a chore. He ate as much as he wanted to, well the next morning (Day 5) our last full day in Orlando. First thing in the morning, I go out in the kitchen area to make a cup of coffee as thats time we share every morning as a group. My aunt says to me ""Why did he take so much food if he wasn't going to eat it."" I replied by saying he ate as much as he wanted to, this turned into my aunt saying something along the lines of ""well its wasteful"" he then left the room to take out the garbage for everyone. This is when my aunt started to yell at me for how he shouldnt be taking food if hes not going to eat it, that hes been ungrateful this entire trip. I would like to put it out there, I paid for our tickets to both events. My grandma paid for our hotel and flights. (we thanked her profusely for this) We decided we wanted to go to the Springs later in the evening as we're night owls. We conveyed this feeling to my family and they responded with how they weren't going to wait on us and that we were wasting away in our room. They then also added that the room was a pig sty, I wont say the room was clean by any means but for being in our hotel room a maximum of 2hrs each day (when not sleeping) will lead to some clothes being around and the pizza plate. This was kind of a red flag to me as not only had the pizza been in our room only that night but the clothes thing really only even happened the previous night. We don't exactly know how they got this info but we can reasonably think they went into our room while we were sleeping. This interaction somehow turned super hostile after, my aunt was making like angry faces towards us whenever she saw us after the morning. Or just giving us the silent treatment when we'd ask about what they had done at the Springs. They graciously drove us later in the night to the Springs, we did ask if it would just be easier to uber as we had a dinner reservation for the two of us and they insisted upon taking us there and then we'd uber back. Which was fine. Well while we're eating dinner we get a text about how they're currently in our room packing our bags for us because they were cleaning the room. This was, as I feel, understandably upsetting. We're grown adults, while young adults yes, we're not children. This felt like a wild invasion of privacy to the two of us especially when they're making comments about how we're filthy and that I was ""raised better than this."" I will say I did kind of crash out about this, it again felt like a huge invasion of privacy to the two us having them go through our belongings. Especially when they barely even know my boyfriend, and how they were treating us up to this point. We get back to the room and they're no where to be found, we decide to watch some TV and hangout a bit before bed. Well we go out into the kitchen area to grab a bowl of cereal and discover the groceries we had paid for had been thrown out. We had every single intention of throwing out the opened groceries in the early morning. We had planned to pack and clean up when we got back. I dont even know how to describe the feeling it gave us besides just disrespected. We have a group chat and they didn't even ask about throwing our groceries away. But they kept theirs in the fridge and on the counter. We then get to flying out of there and back home. The entire morning we are given the silent treatment from the two of them, not a single acknowledgement. Even when we got to the airport we weren't allowed be given our boarding passes as we would ""run off"" without them. The entire flight? Silent. The car ride home? Silent. Even when we thanked them for the trip and the ride home we still recieved silence. So are we the assholes?

1poet2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/theproductblog/comments/1poet2f/implications_for_spending_and_savings_decisions/,Implications for Spending and Savings Decisions,"# How Consumers Hierarchically Map Their Spending, And What It Means for Marketing

We all try to budget. Whether formal or informal, consumers set restrictions on spending, treating money as nonfungible, earmarked for specific functions like 'gas' or 'food'. But how do we truly organize those spending buckets in our minds? The working paper, [***""Consumers’ Mental Representation of Expenditures: Implications for Spending and Savings Decisions,""***](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BFI_WP_2024-159.pdf) by Lin Fei, Daniel M. Bartels, and Walter Zhang, offers a profound answer that moves beyond traditional mental accounting theory: **we represent expenditures in a hierarchical taxonomy**, much like how we organize concepts of the natural world.

If you’ve read the paper, you know this is a game-changer for understanding consumer financial decision-making. Instead of viewing budgeting categories as a single flat list (e.g., just ""food"" or ""entertainment""), the research posits that we categorize spending into multiple, nested levels, where lower levels are specific and higher levels are general.

# The Core Idea: Unpacking the Hierarchy

The researchers tested this hypothesis across seven studies, supported by extensive norming and pilots, using a method called the successive pile-sort. This approach allowed them to recover people’s inherent mental organization of common expenditures (like rent, dining out, or movie tickets).

A key discovery was the presence of **consensus** in these mental representations—people largely agree on the relative taxonomic distance between items. For instance, people instinctively agree that ""shampoo"" and ""sunscreen"" are grouped together at a more specific level than ""shampoo"" and ""movie tickets"". Furthermore, these personal taxonomies are relatively stable over time, suggesting this categorization method is a natural way people organize financial concepts.

If you visualize this, it looks like a tree structure. For example, the expenditure ""Cereal"" is specifically ""Breakfast Food,"" which in turn is nested within the broader category of ""Food,"" all falling under ""Things bought at a grocery store"" (as depicted in Figure 1 of the paper).

# Key Takeaway: Taxonomic Distance Predicts Spending Adjustments

The most impactful finding reveals that this hierarchical structure directly predicts consumer behavior, especially when people deviate from their budget, when they overspend or underspend.

The principle is straightforward: **When consumers deviate from their budget on an item, they spontaneously adjust spending more on items that are taxonomically closer than those that are further away**.

* If you overspend on a new pair of shoes, you are more likely to cut back on spending for jeans (a taxonomically close item) than on bread (a farther item).
* The effect is nuanced, moving beyond the binary ""within-category"" versus ""out-of-category"" definitions previously used in budgeting literature. The degree of adjustment depends on the level at which the items are categorized together.

Crucially, this adjustment behavior is spontaneous; consumers do not need to be explicitly prompted with category labels to exhibit this pattern. The researchers confirmed this pattern across self-reported adjustments (Studies 2a-c), incentivized choices regarding promotion applications (Studies 3a-b), and, most compellingly, in **real-world purchasing data**.

# Study 4: Real-World Grocery Purchases

In an analysis of approximately 6.5 million grocery shopping trips over twelve years, the paper demonstrated the power of taxonomic distance in predicting actual spending. When a focal item was on sale (underspending), consumers increased their spending on comparison items. However, this increase was significantly **larger** if the comparison item was taxonomically close to the focal item.

This finding is particularly insightful because the effect of taxonomic distance persists even when controlling for factors like whether products are substitutes or complements. For example, a sale on pizza impacts purchases of detergents, likely because they share the higher-level category of ""grocery purchases,"" even though they are neither direct substitutes nor complements. This continuous spectrum of influence is a significant departure from the traditional topical vs. comprehensive mental accounts framework.

# Applications and Key Takeaways for Product Marketing Managers (PMMs)

The implications of the hierarchical representation of expenditures are vast, especially for PMMs and anyone involved in designing financial products, digital directories, or promotional strategies.

# 1. Designing Better Product Bundles and Promotions

Understanding taxonomic distance allows marketers to design offers that align with consumer psychological accounts, making promotions intrinsically more appealing.

* **PMM Takeaway:** When devising deals or promotions contingent on purchasing another good, consumers are more willing to claim the deal when the two items are taxonomically close. For example, a discounted bundle of toilet paper and detergents may be more effective than a bundle of detergents and instant coffee, based on how consumers naturally group these items.
* **Leveraging Typicality:** PMMs should note that when the focal item in a deal is typical of its category, the effect of taxonomic distance is more pronounced.

# 2. Enhancing Navigation and User Experience (UX)

The recovered taxonomy provides input for designing directories, menu structures, and even physical store layouts that resonate with how consumers naturally think about expenditures.

* **PMM Takeaway:** For e-commerce platforms or financial apps (categorizing expenses), organizing items into a hierarchy consistent with consumer representation improves the product search experience and reduces complexity. For example, consumers categorize food and daily products closer together than food and clothing.

# 3. Strategic Segmentation and Targeting

Although the research found consensus, variances still exist, particularly on items bordering two clusters (malleable items) or items far from any cluster (exceptional items).

* **PMM Takeaway:** Where consumer representations diverge, PMMs can characterize and target different consumer segments. For example, identifying consumers who naturally group ""wine and cheese"" differently from those who group ""milk and cheese"" allows for specialized marketing messaging and targeting.

This research provides a refined lens for viewing mental budgeting, replacing the rigid binary category approach with a dynamic, hierarchical map of spending relationships. For PMMs, leveraging this insight means building marketing strategies, promotions, and user experiences that speak directly to the consumer’s spontaneous, internal organization of their expenditures.",1,1765922034.0,theproductblog,0,1.0,False

feel uncomfortable with traditional LDS Mormonism but aren't closed off to everything,

or are curious to explore something more inclusive and less rigid.

Some key differences between the Community of Christ and the LDS Church (broadly speaking):

📖 Book of Mormon: The Community of Christ respects it as scripture, but doesn't require literal or central acceptance. It's not a ""test of faith."" Nor do they consider it historical.

🌈 LGBTQ+ people: They are fully accepted. They can be members, leaders, and get married in the church.


👩‍🦰 Women:
Women have been able to be ordained to the priesthood for decades.


🧠 Freedom of belief:
There are no merit interviews, nor strict lists of “forbidden things.” Personal conscience is valued.


🏛️ Authority and structure:
Much less hierarchical and more based on dialogue. The emphasis is on Christ, peace, and social justice, not on “the only true church.”


☕ Word of Wisdom / Law of chastity:
It is not lived in a normative or controlling way. There are no strict codes regarding coffee, alcohol, etc.



I am not here to convince anyone or to replace one church with another.

Just to start a conversation.


If you're from Argentina and this resonates with you—even if it's just a question—feel free to comment here or send me a private message. Even if you just want to chat.

Now some of you are going to say that you should only do coffee for the first date. That's not a good idea, because the women that I know look down on guys like that -- it's low effort and makes you look cheap. Several of the women that I know will insist on splitting the check on a first date. But a lot of women will get offended if you say that you want to split the check before the first date. So you never know what you're going to get.

I matched with someone today who seems like she likes to go out to fancy restaurants.

So I think I'm going to say this: 

>My rule is that I will pay for the first date. I like cocktails and snacks for a first date. But if you want to do dinner for the first day then I expect us to split the check.

I have AuDHD and therefore a real need for INTENSITY in relationships. Thankfully I was gifted the best friend I could've ever asked for a couple of years ago.

My best friend and I (we're both 22) used to be in the most lovely and intense friendship as teens. Like more intimate and meaningful than with any boyfriend I've ever had. 

We've lived in different cities for the past 3 years. 2 years ago she started to act weird and became more distant. I even took us to relationship therapy but we didn't make progress. 

She this summer said she felt abandoned by me when I changed city for a year 3 years ago, and said she emotionally put up a wall to protect herself. I had no idea. Explains a lot. 

The wall is still there and it kills me. She never answers calls. Sometimes texts back only after weeks. This Christmas she said we could maybe meet for coffee sometime since she'll be in my city. 

Accepting that offer would be so degrading and like accepting that she has totally DEMOTED me to ""casual acquaintance for nice 2-hour meet-ups"". I'm not okay with not being intensely affectionate and only vapid. I'd rather have nothing. 3 years ago it would not have been ""if you wanna hang out and grab coffee"" it would've been ""WHEN we hang out"" and we'd hang for days, sleeping over, exploring the woods and city, laugh, do weird shit and just be together 24/7.

The worst part is that when we actually do meet (since my being demoted) I laugh more than with anyone else still. And I feel more love than with anyone else still. 

When I see her this Christmas: Should I say I want to take an undefinite break because it's too painful? I don't want to obsessively scrap for her crumbs when she used to lovingly and by her own account dance into my room with newly baked bread. (odd but true metaphor hahah)

+don't ever people who are older than teenagers need that intensity and deep connection with not just a ""partner"" but with a friend? I don't think I'll ever grow out of that need.",2,1765921747.0,AuDHDWomen,1,0.67,False

This beautifully warm, rich, chocolatey bag absolutely did not disappoint. As others have mentioned, the maple leather is a bit softer and slouchier than the black. I mulled over names for a couple of weeks before landing on Bagatha Mapleborn, the nature-focused Druid coven sister to my witchy Bagatha Blackthorn. 💚🖤 🍃

I also experimented with chain straps and got enthusiastic approval from my husband on the black and brass triple chain. It’s my favorite too. I guess he really does know me. 🥰

1poelj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1poelj6/blandly_tired/,Blandly tired,"I was diagnosed a few months ago and have been steadily tweaking my meds. Currently on 225 mg Lamictal, 15 mg Abilify, Vyvanse and 10 mg Prozac. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been…stable, I guess, sleeping 7.5-8 hours a night consistently, not feeling buzzy or restless or depressed. 

But I’m usually super energetic when not in a depressive episode- opening at work at 5:30 am used to be a complete blast because I had so much energy, I rarely got more than 4 hours of sleep before opening and felt amazing every morning. Now when I get to work I don’t have that energy- I’m just blandly tired. It takes way more effort to interact with customers and keep up the energy, even if I load up on coffee.

I really miss the energy and happiness and feeling on top of the world and chatty and bouncing around all shift. I miss being able to get very little sleep and feel even better than usual the next day. I’m worried I won’t even be able to open anymore.

And on top of this, my medication is making me forget words and lose my train of thought halfway through the sentence, which is awful when 70% percent of my job is chatting with customers. 

I don’t know if there’s a solution here or if I’m just resigned to this now that I’m medicated. My psychiatrist suggested a 10,000 lumen lamp when I open for 5 minutes before I leave, which seems to be helping a little, but not enough to really give me the energy I used to have.

lord knows finding someone on this app is difficult, but i'm no quitter. if i want something, i'll work for it. no matter what it takes. so that brings me here... advertising myself as if i were selling a mop in one of those 90s infomercials (except i wasn't even born then). 

if that made you giggle just a little, i'm glad. 

my name is jaeda and i'm 19. i'll be yapping on your screen for the next 10 minutes or so. i'm single and looking to talk to someone who could potentially change that.  let's get to know me so you'll know if you're up for applying for this job. 

as you could tell from my tag in my title i'm trans. yes, that means the doctors screamed ""it's a boy,"" at the top of their lungs upon my arrival in this world. yes, i was born with **those** parts. and yes, we probably went through the same puberty. except during mine (moreso after) i realised i wasn't the person the doctors saw. i was essentially rapunzel trapped in a tall tower of masculinity and lies... except i'm neither blonde nor white! plus my hair is too short for someone to swing across with. 

i'm fairly new to my transition. i've done so socially and somewhat physically, however, i would love to take further steps in the physical aspect. my largest goal in my 2026 to-do list (crazy i already have one) is to start hormone therapy. yes, buying the juice that'll grow my lady parts. interesting biology fact: did you know everyone is practically genetically capable of producing breast milk? well now you know. i know you didn't. 

(pushes board to the side) now that the admin has been tackled, let's get into to the juicy stuff. still waiting to see what i look like? just scroll down already. geez impatient much? 

i would describe my personality with a book. no, not a comic book. certainly not a novel, and most definitely not a biography. too many triggers there anyway. i would describe myself with an encyclopedia. there are 103 things that can piss me off, and you've probably done at least 28 of them. come on i'm just pulling your leg... now sit still. i would say i'm empathetic, energetic, quite moody (but you wouldn't tell), loving, humorous (say i'm funny), and emotional. 

if you had 2 pennies for every time you predicted anything i did or said, you'd probably still be searching the couch for a few. but i say wildcards are fun. am i wild card? no. am i guarded? yes. and that's simply because people take advantage of what they know works for them or is willing to help and be there for them. maybe we have that common, so now you're wondering who's coming clean about their childhood first. 

connecting with people is hard for me but not for the reasons you might think. see because i'm empathetic, and i mean this wholeheartedly, i carry people's energy and emotions with me. you think i'm lying? 99% of my bad days are caused by feeling burdened by everyone's problems so much so that i forget to take care of myself. that's something i'm admitting for the first time out loud, so hopefully my honest counts for something. 

in that sense i hate energy vampires. no, i don't mean literal energy vampires but i mean people who only talk to you to make themselves feel better. you know the ones who reply in -2 minutes when you ask them something about themselves but their dog contracts alzheimer's and loses a left knee when you say you had a bad day? yeah. dislike them people. so hopefully you're genuinely looking for connection and conversation, and not an ego boost. cus i'm not... i don't even own an ego. can't afford one... bad credit score. 

anyway i'm sure you're asking yourself ""where is this wackadoodle from and why aren't we talking yet?"" that last part might be because you're still reading my doctoral thesis on why i'm single. but that first part, i'm south african. that's right! the birthplace of humankind... or one of the places. i'm from a very small town originally but I live in a slightly less smaller town. nelspruit! search it... you'll probably run into me on google maps. 

with that comes my timezone, gmt+2. so if this a timezone you can't work with, that's understandable. i'm okay working with any time so long as we discuss how we'll communicate. you could be in mars and i'm sure we'd still work something out. 

now comes your favourite section... my looks. i'll just kindly drop this. https://imgur.com/a/Cuc35Kb

assuming you saw me, i'll let you know tha my gender expression varies between feminine and masculine. i may have feminine mannerisms but they are accompanied by a bit of masculinity. why am i explaining this? i'm glad you asked. if you didn't... just take a seat and earn extra credit. could help you pass.

you see i'm a trans woman and with that comes the expectation for me to be hyper feminine to affirm my identity. but then that's not what makes a woman who they are because we have masc women and fem women. if they are cis, they are granted the pleasure to be (to an extent) but once they are trans... the world throws a hissy fit. i'm nonconforming to everything on some degree or another so i just let myself be and i would love for someone to do the same for me as well as themselves. 

guess what? we're almost done because now comes the section about you. 

one thing about me? i'm a simple gal... mostly. the only criteria i have are these two traits. 

1) tall
2) queer 

let's further elaborate. also if you think i typed this on chatgpt for some odd reason, we gotta get your AI-identification skills up. 

i like tall guys because height differences give me butterflies. well how tall am i? 165cm or 5'5"" in burger scales. what height do i consider to be tall to me? 5'9"" and above. you may very well be 9'7"" and i'd still reach up for that peck. but seriously that's all for me. 

and i like queer guys (bi/pan/poly/multi) because queer people relate to other queer (mostly) on the basis of being different. if you're straight and think you can handle a girlfriend with a gruelling math teacher's voice then be my guest. but queer guys do it for me the most. 

another thing, be yourself. don't care too much about being diplomatic or sarcastic or bombastic or whatever word rhymes with plastic because that's fake. see what i did there? ... no? alright. 

please be willing to share a picture of yourself upon our conversation. i would like to know who i'm talking to and physical attraction to me does matter. hell you might think i'm physically unattractive to you and that's fine. but let's not catfish. race and weight and eye colour and whatever aren't factors for me. if i find you cute, you're cute to me. simple. 

now ignore all my spelling errors and say something to me. you know you want to. bye!!

1poei6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1poei6y/mf_a_grown_up_bed_time_story/,[MF] A Grown Up Bed Time Story,"In the city, there was a street that only existed after midnight.

Not in the spooky way—no fog, no whispering shadows, no cats with secrets. It was just… quiet. As if the whole world agreed to stop performing for a while.

Mira first found it on a Tuesday that had gone wrong in small, irritating ways: the kind of wrong that doesn’t make a good story later, only a tired sigh now. A spilled coffee. A meeting that could’ve been an email. A phone call that left her feeling like she’d been gently scolded by someone who’d never met her.

She walked home later than usual, keys already in hand, ready to unlock her door and lock the day behind her.

And then she saw the sign.

It wasn’t neon. It wasn’t charming. It looked like a normal metal street sign that had simply… decided to be there.

**MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LANE**

She blinked. Looked away. Looked back. Still there.

The lane itself was narrow, wedged between two buildings she was certain did not have a gap between them. A warm light spilled out from it like lamplight from a memory. The sensible part of her brain said: *Don’t.* The exhausted part said: *Just five minutes. Just to prove it’s real.*

So she stepped in.

And immediately, the city sound fell away. Not like someone turned it off. More like she’d closed a door softly, with one palm.

The lane was paved in old stones that didn’t trip her, even though they should’ve. Window boxes overflowed with plants that looked watered and cared for, the kind of cared for you don’t have time to do but always swear you will. There were little shops—too small to be practical—each with a painted door and a single item displayed in the window like a promise.

A bakery with one perfect loaf. A bookshop with one red spine, waiting. A tiny tailor with a dress hanging on a wooden form—unfinished, patient.

Then she noticed something odd: there were no prices. No “open” signs. No advertisements. Nothing wanted her attention. Nothing tried to win.

Halfway down the lane, there was a café with only three tables. One was occupied by an elderly man reading a newspaper that didn’t rustle. One was occupied by a woman in a raincoat, stirring tea that never cooled. The third was empty, as if it had been reserved in advance.

Mira sat down before she could overthink it.

A waiter appeared—not creeping, not startling, just *there*, like he’d always been part of the scene and her eyes were catching up. He wore a plain apron and the calm expression of someone who’d never been in a hurry and didn’t judge people who were.

“What do you serve?” Mira asked.

He tilted his head, considering, as if she’d asked what the sky was made of.

“Relief,” he said. “Mostly.”

Mira almost laughed, but it came out like a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding all day.

“I’ll take that,” she said.

The waiter nodded once and left.

On the table was a small notebook and a pencil. No branding. No menu. Just the notebook open to a blank page, as if the lane had politely assumed she had things to say.

Mira stared at it.

She thought of all the notes she kept—lists, reminders, passwords, half-finished plans. Notes that shoved her forward. Notes that made tomorrow heavier.

Her hand hovered over the pencil.

Instead of writing what she had to do, she wrote the first thing she actually felt:

*I am tired.*

The words sat there, simple and real. Nothing clever. Nothing productive. Nothing to optimize.

She waited for guilt to arrive. It didn’t.

The waiter returned with a cup—not coffee, not tea, not anything she could name. The steam smelled like clean sheets and a quiet morning and the first warm day after a long winter.

She took a sip.

And it did something strange: it didn’t give her energy. It gave her permission.

Permission to be one person, not a whole committee. Permission to stop scanning the day for mistakes. Permission to let the world spin without her grabbing the wheel.

Across the lane, the little tailor shop door opened. A young man stepped out carrying a spool of thread, as if he’d been sent on an errand. He looked at Mira, then did something that startled her more than the magical street ever could:

He smiled, not because he wanted something, but because he noticed her and that was enough.

Mira smiled back without thinking.

For a moment, she felt the shape of her own face doing something kind.

She looked down at the notebook again. Her pencil moved.

*I did enough today.* *I can’t fix everything.* *I’m allowed to be unfinished.*

As she wrote, the lane seemed to soften around her, as if it approved. The plants looked greener. The lamplight warmer. The quiet deeper.

When she finished the last sentence, the notebook gently closed itself. Not a slam. A tidy, polite closing, like a book that understood the chapter was over.

The waiter returned and placed a small token on the table: a smooth stone, warm as if it had been in someone’s pocket.

“For later,” he said.

“For what?” Mira asked.

“For the moment you forget you can stop,” he replied.

Mira turned the stone over in her fingers. It had no markings. It didn’t need them.

She stood, suddenly afraid that if she stayed too long, she’d start thinking of this place as a tool—something to use, something to schedule. And the lane felt too pure for that. Like a kindness you could ruin by trying to deserve it.

She walked back the way she came. The city sounds returned gradually, like a blanket laid over her shoulders.

At the mouth of the lane, she looked back.

The sign was still there.

Then she blinked, and it wasn’t.

The buildings were sealed together again, as if they’d never made space for her.

Mira didn’t panic. She didn’t feel tricked. She still had the warm stone in her hand, and her chest felt—if not light—then at least less crowded.

She walked home.

Inside her apartment, the day still existed: dishes, laundry, notifications. The usual chorus of small demands. But something had shifted. She wasn’t the stage manager anymore. She was just a person, in a room, at night, allowed to be quiet.

She set the stone on her bedside table.

Then she did one more thing, the most adult thing she’d done all day:

She went to bed before she’d earned it.

And as her eyes closed, she thought—not in words, but in a feeling—about that lane that existed when you needed it most.

Not to escape your life.

Just to remember it belonged to you.",1,1765921304.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1poei4y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1poei4y,These Salted Caramel Apple Thumbprints Taste Like A Caramel Apple In Cookie Form,"**Salted Caramel Apple Butter Thumbprints with Brown-Butter Shortbread**

(An optional nut-free batch for my Jackie!)

I developed this recipe when I had a jar of apple butter I didn’t know what to do with. These cookies are warm, cozy, and full of fall comfort. These thumbprints are nutty, brown-butter shortbread, thickened apple butter, and a warm drizzle of caramel. The kind of cookie that holds you close for a moment before you *Ramble On* again.

**Ingredients**

**Brown-butter shortbread dough**

2 1/2 cups (300 g) all-purpose flour

1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter

½ cup granulated sugar (100 g)

½ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

½ cup (60 g) walnuts, optional

**Apple butter filling**

1½ cups (380 g) apple butter

½ teaspoon finely grated lemon zest

½ tsp cinnamon

2 teaspoons maple syrup

⅛ teaspoon vanilla bean paste, optional but recommended

Pinch nutmeg

Pinch salt

½ to 1 teaspoon apple brandy, optional (to taste)

**Finish**

Caramel sauce, homemade or store-bought (see recipe below)

4 tablespoons (30 g) peanuts, optional  
(omit for nut-free batch)

**Method**

**Brown the Butter**

Melt the 1 cup (300 g) unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Swirl as it foams, watch for tiny brown speckles.

Remove from heat when the butter smells nutty and looks golden. Do not strain out the brown-butter solids; that’s where the flavor is. Let cool 1-2 minutes until the sizzling softens, then sprinkle in the ¼ teaspoon cinnamon and let it bloom 30-60 seconds, stirring continuously.

Cool until it thickens, then whisk in the teaspoon of vanilla. Continue to cool the butter in the refrigerator to resolidify before using.

**Make Shortbread Dough**

If using nuts, toast them first. Walnuts may be toasted on the stovetop or in the oven. For stovetop toasting, place the walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and lightly golden. For oven toasting, spread the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring once, until fragrant. Transfer to a plate and cool completely, then chop very finely before adding to the dough.

If finishing the cookies with peanuts, toast them separately using the same method. Keeping the walnuts and peanuts in separate batches makes them easier to use later and prevents the peanuts from overwhelming the final flavor.  Set aside and allow to cool completely before finely chopping.

In a bowl, measure out the flour and salt, whisk together to combine, and set aside.

In a mixing bowl, add the cooled brown butter and the ½ cup sugar. Mix until combined.

Then, add the flour/salt and gently mix until just combined.

Fold in 1/2 cup walnuts, if using.

Turn the dough onto a clean surface and gently combine with your hands until it just comes together. A little crumbly is fine; don't overwork the dough.

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator overnight (ideal) or at least 2 hours. The dough can keep 3-4 days refrigerated.  
You can freeze unbaked dough for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before shaping.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm for 10 minutes before shaping.

**Bake**

Before shaping the cookies, lightly grease or spray mini muffin pan for easy release.

Scoop about 1 Tbsp (12-14 g) of dough per muffin cup and press down and around the edges to form a cup. Freeze 15-20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 14-18 minutes until pale but set, with lightly golden brown edges. You are not looking for golden brown. Due to the brown butter, the cookies may not appear golden on the edges. Look for a set texture, and when you take them out, you should hear a slight sizzling sound. Immediately tamp down the center of each cookie with the small, round end of a wooden spoon or similar, before they set.

Cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Gently turn the cookies in the pan, this will ensure they are not sticking. Then carefully remove with your fingers and place on the cooling rack. If the cookies don’t pop out easily, use a spatula or knife to carefully loosen the edges.

Cool cookies completely (30-60 minutes) before filling. Cooled cookies can be frozen before filling.

Fill each indentation with just enough apple butter to be just below the rim; do not overfill. Leave room for the caramel and peanuts.

**Notes**

Between batches, allow the pan to cool completely and wipe away any residue before baking the next batch. There is no need to respray.

If not enough dough for two complete batches, use both outer cup rows and stagger the inner ones.

When pressing the dough, if you can see any of the pan through the bottom add a tiny bit extra dough and press

**Apple Butter Filling**

Simmer the apple butter 5-10 minutes until thick and glossy. It should be like a very thick jam or a soft dough. To check, dab a small amount on a plate and after about 2 minutes, if a watery rim develops, then it is still too thin. Best if used the same day.

Remove from heat and gently stir in the lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt. A “pinch” is just a small amount between the finger and thumb, less than ⅛ tsp.

Cool completely, 20-30 minutes. Warm filling can cause the butter in the cookies to start to melt.

Then add 1/2-1 tsp apple brandy, if using (to taste).

**Note**

For the half-boozy, half non-boozy divide cooled apple butter, and add ¼ to ½ tsp of brandy (to taste).  
Lemon zest is ideal; you can use lemon juice, but sparingly.

Any leftover filling can be used on toast, pancakes, French toast, etc.

**Finish**

Drizzle the caramel over the cooled cookies.

Top with very finely chopped salted roasted peanuts.

When using finely chopped roasted peanuts, Less Is More. Use about 1/8 teaspoon per cookie. Too many peanuts will overwhelm the brown-butter and apple-butter flavors.

**Storage**

Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. These cookies freeze well for up to 3 months, but for optimum serving, they should be frozen without the caramel or peanuts. You can freeze fully assembled, but the caramel may become grainy or loose upon thawing.

Do not refrigerate baked cookies. It will dry them out and make them go stale faster.

Thaw at room temperature for 10-15 minutes; add caramel and peanuts before serving.

 

**Homemade Salted Caramel**

**Ingredients**

1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar  
6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter, cut into pieces  
1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream, warmed slightly  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1/4 tsp salt  

**Method**

Add the sugar to a dry saucepan over medium heat. Let the edges melt, then swirl or stir until fully melted and deep amber. Any clumps will melt as it cooks.

Whisk in the butter carefully; it will bubble.

Slowly pour in the warm cream while whisking continuously to prevent clumping and remove from the heat. Gently stir in the vanilla and 1/8 tsp of salt.

Let cool for 5-10 minutes before using.

**Storage**

Refrigerate up to 2 weeks. If too thick, microwave in 10-15 second bursts to loosen.

Delicious in coffee, over ice cream, on apple slices, with brownies, in hot chocolate, or drizzled on pancakes.

**Notes**

Nut-Free Version for My Jackie, just simply omit walnuts from the dough and do not finish with peanuts.

I'd spend more money there if they did. What a difference something as simple as this would make:

[https://youtu.be/236pXlBxWbw](https://youtu.be/236pXlBxWbw)

I've been to physio clinics, cafés and restaurants that felt like the inside of a snare drum, places where the owners clearly gave little or no thought to how the acoustic environment affects people. Simple (and stylish!) acoustic modifications could attract an entire demographic of people who would otherwise stay away because of the noise level.

In St. John's, *The Postmaster Bakery* and café on Rawlin's Cross is impossible for me to tolerate for more than the time it takes to place my order, even when it's half-filled with customers. I love their food and coffee, but as soon as I get my order, I'm out.  
  
*The Grounds Café* and restaurant at Murray's Garden Centre in Portugal Cove has some the best food in town, but the tilted ceilings seem designed to reverberate every clanking dish and cutlery and cup in place. Like most places that serve food, they often crank up a tinny radio to, what, *cancel out the noise?* The food they make can be world-class at times, but...  
  
Like many places, I have to gage the noise level, those high frequently sounds that burn into my brain, before I decide whether or not to stay (and spend my money there).

Those are two my favourite places that I wish weren't so noisy, and could easily be fixed. There are more.

*I'm curious if I'm the only one in St. John's who loves places like this, but often has to walk away because the noise is too much to handle.*",3,1765920946.0,StJohnsNL,1,0.8,False

Chase just dropped their Q1 2026 rotating categories and dining is the clear winner. Here's what you need to know:

**The Math on** [Chase Freedom Flex®](https://www.joinkudos.com/explore-cards/card/2883)

* 5% quarterly bonus on dining (up to $1,500 in spend during quarter)
* 2% permanent dining category multiplier
* 1% base rate
* **= 7% total cash back on dining**

(Regular Freedom card earns 5% since it doesn't have the permanent dining bonus)

**What Counts as Dining:**

* Restaurants (dine-in, takeout)
* Coffee shops and fast food
* Food delivery apps (DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.)
* **Pro tip:** Gift cards purchased through DoorDash code as dining

**The Details:**

* $1,500 combined spending cap across all Q1 categories
* Max earning: $105 back (or 7,500 UR points if you have the [Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card](https://www.joinkudos.com/explore-cards/card/509))
* [Must activate ](https://www.chasebonus.com/)by March 14, 2026 (but rewards are retroactive)
* Valid January 1 - March 31, 2026

**Other Q1 Categories:**

* Norwegian Cruise Line (5%)
* American Heart Association donations (5%)

**Perfect Pairing:** [Discover it ](https://www.joinkudos.com/explore-cards/card/821)is doing 5% on groceries Q1 2026. If you have both cards:

* Freedom Flex for dining ($1,500 cap at 7%)
* Discover it for groceries ($1,500 cap at 5%)

Once you hit the Freedom Flex cap, switch to [Citi Custom Cash](https://www.joinkudos.com/explore-cards/card/2885) for continued 5% on dining (up to $500/month).

**Strategy:**

1. Activate now through Chase app or website
2. Use for all restaurant spend, coffee runs, takeout
3. Consider buying DoorDash gift cards to accelerate to the cap
4. Switch to Custom Cash after maxing out

This is probably the best dining multiplier we'll see on a no-AF card this year. Thoughts on how you're planning to maximize it?

A friend was staying over and decided to mess with the grinder. He did a cold start with the adjustment set to around 20 clicks and very low RPM, about 300. The grinder stalled and jammed. After it stopped, he added more beans, turned it on again, then just left it powered on and gave up on making coffee.

About two hours later I got home, turned it off, and cleaned it properly. Since then, the grinder will not start.

The master switch turns on and lights up, but the power button does absolutely nothing. The burrs are not stuck. I already tried leaving it turned off for over an hour to cool down, but it still doesn’t work.

The grinder is out of warranty and there is no official service or assistance for this machine here in Brazil. I know my friend made a mistake, but honestly a grinder this expensive should not die just because it got jammed once.

I tried opening it with the correct tool to access the power button and internals, but the screws are insanely tight and very soft. They start stripping before I can loosen them.

At this point I’m stuck and pretty frustrated. Any tips on what I can try next would be really appreciated.",1,1765920583.0,DF83,0,1.0,False

With pourovers specifically it can be a fun experiment to test what foods compliment your current bean because the flavor profiles can vary so drastically.

We've lived in different cities for the past 3 years. 2 years ago she started to act weird and became more distant. I even took us to relationship therapy but we didn't make progress. 

She this summer said she felt abandoned by me when I changed city for a year 3 years ago, and said she emotionally put up a wall to protect herself. I had no idea. Explains a lot. 

The wall is still there and it kills me. She never answers calls. Sometimes texts back only after weeks. This Christmas she said we could maybe meet for coffee sometime since she'll be in my city. 

Accepting that offer would be so degrading and like accepting that she has totally DEMOTED me to ""casual acquaintance for nice 2-hour meet-ups"". I'm not okay with not being intensely affectionate and only vapid. I'd rather have nothing. 3 years ago it would not have been ""if you wanna hang out and grab coffee"" it would've been ""WHEN we hang out"" and we'd hang for days, sleeping over, exploring the woods and city, laugh, do weird shit and just be together 24/7.

The worst part is that when we actually do meet (since my being demoted) I laugh more than with anyone else still. And I feel more love than with anyone else still. 

When I see her this Christmas: Should I say I want to take an undefinite break because it's too painful? I don't want to obsessively scrap for her crumbs when she used to lovingly and by her own account dance into my room with newly baked bread.

So, I match with this man, Dirk. He’s older, a lawyer, and a law professor in Brussels. At first, I’m thinking, ""Okay, high-value, intelligent, finally someone I can look up to."" 

I tell him I’m a PA for a regional director and finishing my Master’s, so the intellectual vibe was definitely there.

But then the red flags started waving like a parade.

I told him straight up: I live in **** and I hate driving into Brussels. I’ve had such bad experiences there lately. Do you think he offered to meet me halfway? Nope. He kept pushing me to ""jump in my car"" and come to his office or his pied-à-terre on Avenue Louise. It was all about his convenience, zero effort for me.

Before we even met for a coffee, he starts taking the conversation into this weirdly sexual place. He starts talking about 50 Shades of Grey, dominance, and asking if I’d want to be handcuffed. I told him chemistry depends on the person and that I’m more into the ""romantic"" side, but he was just fixated on this ""naughty"" fantasy.

The final straw? I suggested a first date at a public wine bar because I’m ""old-fashioned"" (a.k.a. I value my safety). He actually replied, ""Please don’t be old-fashioned. No need to.""
Can you believe that? A law professor telling a woman she ""doesn't need"" to worry about safety or boundaries for a first meeting.


I couldn't let it slide. I sent him a long message telling him that while he talks about wanting ""stable and loyal,"" his actions say he just wants a transaction. I told him safety is a non-negotiable standard, not an ""outdated trend,"" and that I could tell he had zero investment in my well-being.

I (20f) have been dating my bf (20m) for a little less than a month. He’s sweet and has been nothing but loving to me. For the purpose of this post, we’ll call him Nathaniel. 

As much as I love him, I admit a piece of my heart belongs to girl best friend, Starla (20f).

I was sitting with her in a coffee shop today and she turns to me and says, “Trisha, I have to tell you something.” She is always someone who jokes with me, but now she’s serious so I’m serious. She says, “I have a crush on you,” and I’m SHOCKED. I don’t know how to respond, so I start laughing. She says she’s had a crush on me for awhile.

Here’s where the problem lies. She is always jokingly flirting with me, so I don’t know if she’s being stupid. Not that she isn’t genuine, but she flirts a lot. 

Not only that, but what I have with Nathaniel is solid and loving, but new. I admitted I had a crush on her to her before I met him, so she knows how I felt, and I think I still may feel that way…

Maybe she feels that way, too? What should I do???",1,1765920075.0,Advice,13,0.66,False

The article describes individuals who are driven, ambitious, and mentally sharp, yet easily irritated and overworked. Sensitivity to noise, light, and interruptions is highlighted, along with difficulty relaxing even during rest.

Commonly described features include reliance on stimulants such as coffee or alcohol, digestive disturbances, insomnia (especially waking around 3–4 AM), headaches, and stress-related complaints. The mental state reflects impatience, intensity, and a constant push to achieve.

The post also contrasts Nux Vomica with other remedies, emphasizing its distinct picture of tension, overexertion, and reactive temperament.

The “checkout” was: pick a network, copy an address, triple-check it, guess a fee, and then stare at a pending screen like it’s 2011. My card would’ve been done before I finished pasting the memo.

So why does “internet money” still feel like moving furniture?

**What I keep bumping into:**

* **Taxes + tracking:** In many places, spending crypto is treated like disposing an asset. Congrats, your $5 coffee is now a tiny tax event with a cost basis.
* **Volatility + merchant stress:** Merchants don’t want revenue swinging between “nice day” and “why are we broke” before payroll clears.
* **No undo button:** Crypto’s finality is great until you typo one character. No chargebacks, no “refund it to the same card,” just an expensive lesson.
* **Fragmented rails:** L1s, L2s, bridges, wrapped tokens, different wallet standards… it’s like every store in the mall only takes a different kind of cash.
* **UX still isn’t normal:** Seed phrases, gas, confirmations, and signing popups are not “tap to pay.”

That’s why a random find caught my attention: [**Digitap Presale**](https://presale.digitap.app/?utm_source=reddit%20marketing&utm_medium=organicmarketingaj&utm_campaign=17dec) **($TAP Presale)**. I’m not affiliated, but the pitch is interesting: a crypto-fiat “omni-bank” that says it’ll give you a virtual crypto debit card + offshore-style fiat account, with Apple Pay / Google Pay support and 100+ tokens. Their checkout shows Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay, BTC, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet—pretty mainstream on-ramp options.

If you’re hunting the best crypto presale to buy now / best crypto presales 2025, what matters more to you: real payments UX, audits, or pure token hype? And realistically… would you ever spend BTC/ETH, or only stablecoins?

1podv5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1podv5u/the_ultimate_yield/,The Ultimate Yield,"There are moments in wrestling that transcend mere spectacle, moments where the ring becomes a theater of raw, unfiltered truth. Last Saturday bore witness to one such indelible scene. John Felix Anthony Cena, the indomitable force of hustle, loyalty and respect didn't so much tap out in submission as peacefully acquiesce to an eventuality. The invincible, once invisible Doctor of Thuganomics bowed out with conspicuous tranquility to a vise-like sleeper hold after a twenty four minute masterpiece, in an ending that was very intentionally meant to be more Cirque du Soleil and less WrestleMania. The arena's initial roar dissolved into stunned silence, then boos cascaded down like judgment. Yet, in the days since, the profundity of that surrender has revealed itself, not as diminishment, but as the sublime, almost erotic conclusion to an unparalleled saga. 

Gunther's ascent commands reverence precisely because of its origins in abject humility. Beginning as an overlooked, perpetually rejected coffee boy, he managed the counter with quiet desperation, forever extending tentative invitations, only to be dismissed time and again as an unworthy derelict, consigned to the shadows. Each subsequent rejection carving deeper into him than the previous, yet rather than break, it forged something implacable. From that humble emasculation, he alchemized pain into dominance, emerging as arguably the greatest of all time, the indefatigable ring general and legend killer who retired Goldberg with ruthless efficiency and now claimed the scalp of the once invincible Cena. The thunderous chops that leave skin blooming, the suffocating sleeper that drains resistance with the determination of a python; these are evolved instruments of a man who has known denial and transformed it into absolute command. 

The match itself unfolded with intensity. Cena entered with familiar fire, delivering shoulder blocks that echoed through the Capital One Arena, the Five Knuckle Shuffle igniting nostalgia, multiple Attitude Adjustments, one spectacularly through the announce table, reminding us of his enduring power. He even applied his own sleeper and STFU, a teasing reversal that only heightened the eventual inevitability. Gunther absorbed every assault, his frame unyielding, countering with power bombs and splashes of relentless, calculated cruelty. As the sleeper cinched in repeatedly, Cena's resistance began to ebb and there emerged glimmers of a body betraying the spirit that had carried it this far. And then, in that final application, something exquisite transpired: a fleeting smile crossed Cena's face, serene, almost euphoric, before his hand tapped. 

Fans may have craved a more traditional victory, one last defiant stand, one final roar of never-give-up, but the audience has never truly been equipped to dictate outcomes that transcend the enigma and nuance of wrestling's unpredictable spectacle. That hunger for the familiar is understandable, visceral even, yet it overlooks the deeper artistry at play: a deliberate subversion, a quiet poetry in surrender that elevates both men. 

The aftermath only deepened the resonance. As Gunther departed amid a storm of disapproval, the locker room emptied onto the stage, veterans and newcomers alike, bestowing titles upon the downed warrior in symbolic coronation and farewell. The chants shifted to Thank you Cena, tears traced paths down hardened faces, and Cena himself kissed the mat, removed his armbands and dispersing them to the faithful. It was cathartic release, a collective exhalation after years of holding breath. 

This submission aligns perfectly with wrestling's most enduring traditions: the Heart Break Kid yielding to the Undertaker's Hell's Gate, Flair's tearful I'm-sorry-I-love-you tap to Michaels, moments where vulnerability magnifies legacy rather than diminishes it. Cena's entire farewell tour, battles against Rhodes, Punk, Orton, Lesnar, served this purpose: to anoint the future while burnishing his own myth. From the rejected barista who endured the humiliation of being unable to secure a single date to the imperious champion who compelled the greatest superstar of his era to submit with apparent contentment, Gunther's arc, for the time being, feels complete. Cena, in turn, departs not diminished, but exalted, having gifted the business one final, selfless act of elevation. The sting of that tap will fade; what endures is the beauty of its necessity. In yielding with effortless composure, Cena ensured his immortality, and gave us the perfect goodbye.",1,1765919794.0,WWE,1,1.0,False

They lived together for a year and then I moved in a year later (last year). Then, last year, girl 2 got a boyfriend and moved in with him after a month of dating, and barely spoke to girl 1 until last month, when he cheated on her and she had to move back in.

I’ve become really close with girl 1 over the last year, and she’s been very hurt and annoyed that girl 2 ditched her.

Now she’s back she’s just… always around. Always with girl 1. I asked girl 1 if we can go get a coffee sometime but she’s worried girl 2 will get mad and question why she’s out without her. It’s so silly, that’s not what an adult friendship should look. Girl 1 will sometimes complain to me that she’s always clinging to her and won’t leave her alone….

And you’re only slagging her off to me because you sense I feel a little betrayed.

I told her I was a little disappointed that she’s not putting up boundaries, but she seems to think that this way is easier than upsetting girl 2. Just sucks.

I know pregnancy is tough for a lot of people, but I didn't expect to feel this alone.

I've been completely wiped out... like, dead tired where I can barely keep up with basic stuff around the house, let alone cook a proper meal. The headaches are a killer too, they make me dizzy and nauseous, and sometimes I skip eating because I just don't have the energy to make anything. It's this awful cycle where not eating makes me even more tired. My husband is great when he's home...he helps a ton with chores and whatever I need but he works long shifts, so most days I'm by myself. What really gets to me is his family. They haven't visited once, haven't offered any real help, nothing. They're about 40 minutes away, and every time we see them, it's the classic ""let us know if you need anything."" His mother is retired and his father only works part time. But when I have asked like for his sister to come over or help with something (we are close) since I've been so sick, it's always excuses. His sister is my age, lives with their parents rent-free, doesn't work... plenty of time, but yeah, excuses. She even made some rude comments about how I'm ""selfish"" for having a baby and that my life is over now because I can't just do whatever I want anymore, like day drink or sleep in all day like her. Super disrespectful. 

He has three older siblings, all pushing 40, none married or want to have kids at all, so I guess they think we're weird for starting a family. His parents act excited about the grandchild, but actions speak louder...no gifts, no drop-offs, no visits. They come into the city once a week for their favorite store but never stop by or even ask if I want to join for coffee. At this point, I'm not chasing them. I even agreed to doing the yearly christmas event on actual christmas day when I didn't want to, I told my husband that christmas day is a sacred holiday for me as im the only Christian in the family and I wanted to have a slow, holy morning with just the two of us since it will be our last and he stated ""no its not"", he simply doesnt understand. So I caved and at this point I dont even want to go, im expected to drop everything for them but they have not done a SINGLE thing for us since we even moved here two years ago tbh. 

They haven't texted to check in, like ever. His mom went weeks without saying anything, then just ""update please."" No hello, no how are you. I ignored it, then hours later ""still waiting on my update."" So I sent a screenshot of the baby app thing (size, progress, how mom's feeling) to shut her up and she replies ""interesting."" Radio silence again. Which i find extremely rude, even the way she asked and I told my husband and he said ""wow, not really the way to go about that"" so at least I have his support. I said I feel like nothing more than an incubator.

This isn't new and I shouldnt be suprised. During our wedding, they didn't lift a finger while my family did everything, his mother even asked 1 hour before the ceremony if we could change the procession so she could be walked down the isle by her son (my husband) when I had already previously said no because it would have changed the whole order of things, she already had been walked down the isle and had her own wedding. And when I had a miscarriage last time (we were moving), I asked for help packing or whatever since first trimester is rough... crickets. Husband and I did it all alone.

My mom has been amazing though, she visits a couple times a week with food (since my appetite is trash), buys baby stuff, and it's just nice to have someone to talk to about pregnancy struggles, but we do have a complicated relationship.

I'm just so hurt and angry. Part of me wants to cut them out postpartum, not share updates or anything. They know I'm struggling since my husband has told them and has tried encouraging them for a visit or even a get together when theyre in the city...they seem to have time to visit his brother who lives 10 minutes away from us but moreso in the country side...he also conveniently always pays for lunch whenever they get together....we don't. Simply cant afford it. But they don't seem to care. I've talked to my husband about it, but there's only so much he can do.

Sorry for the long rant, I just needed to get it out.

1podr2s,https://i.redd.it/2xsjhanspm7g1.png,"In Ohio in 1954, Bernard Schreiber, 17, was teased by classmates for being a virgin. To ""prove his manhood"", he and a 12-year-old boy stalked Mary Friess, 17, for 3 days, attacking her when she spurned his advances. The younger boy knocked out Mary. Schreiber then raped her and stabbed her to death.","[Bernard Schreiber's arrest and confession](https://imgur.com/a/a7ePGVN) ([link to the original article](https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/detroit-free-press/44283049/))

Bernard Schreiber was born in Monclova in 1937. He had never been in trouble before and was friends with several younger boys. They frequently messed with him since he had only had one date with a girl and was a virgin. So, Schreiber decided to change that. In August 1954, Schreiber and a 12-year-old companion were in Sylvania Township when a 17-year-old school girl whom they did not know, Mary Jolene Freiss, rode past on a bicycle going for the mail. Schreiber immediately took a liking to her. The two boys proceeded to follow the girl for three days, watching her make trips to a mail box. On the third day, Schreiber approached Friess. The girl immediately spurned his advances.

The next day, the two boys hid in some weeds alongside the path taken by Friess. When the girl rode pass, the two ambushed her. The younger boy knocked her off her bicycle by a hit to the head with a club. Friess dizzily fled into the woods, but was struck twice more and knocked unconscious. The younger boy then left the scene. Schreiber then dragged Mary deeper into the woods, tore up her clothes, and raped her. When Mary regained consciousness, Schreiber became worried that she would identify him. He stabbed the girl twice in the chest, killing her. He then went home and ate lunch.

About a week later, the police received a tip from a neighbor, who reported that Schreiber had confessed to his mother, saying, ""I just killed a girl. I stabbed her twice."" Schreiber's mother said she was horrified by her son's confession, but wasn't sure what to do. After initially denying his guilt, Schreiber confessed after failing a lie detector test. Before making his statement, Schreiber took the police to a dump two miles from the scene. There, they found fragments of the girl's eyeglasses. After returning, Schreiber put his feet on the prosecutor's desk, puffed a pipe, and related how he and the younger boy had planned the crime. Sipping a cup of coffee, he talked about how they had stalked her for days.

>""She looked good. We decided to wait for her. I was intrigued and aroused by the way she was dressed in bra and shorts. She had a pretty nice looking shape and that's what got me.""

When confronted by the police, the younger boy cried and denied any involvement in the murder, but admitted to his initial participation.

The police asked Schreiber and the younger boy about unrelated things. Schreiber had aspired to became a Marine after his graduation. He enjoyed reading comic books, mainly about Superman and Captain Marvel, and usually stayed at home. When asked about television programs, he said he liked mysteries, ""especially those which send thrills down my spine like Dragnet."" He said he had no particular hobby, ""but liked to fool around with carpentry and mechanics."" The younger boy, described as small for his age, was called an average student and interested in sports. He'd followed his normal pursuits since the crime.

Schreiber remained at home, watching television and peering through his windows. Sheriff William Hirsch, described Schreiber, who was called ""a religious-minded youth who never missed mass,"" as ""a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" Schreiber said that he and his accomplice had driven to the scene after the body was discovered. He spent about two hours in the Sheriff's posse, ""just to see how far they were getting with their investigation.""

Schreiber was charged with first degree murder. He was certified to stand trial as an adult and went on trial in January 1955. He waived his right to a jury trial and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. At his trial, Schreiber said his accomplice was more culpable than he had initially claimed. What really happened, he said, was that the younger boy had told him, ""Go ahead, get it over with."" The boy waited at the road. When Schreiber returned to him 10 minutes later, he asked, ""Are you finished so soon?""

The younger boy had not been charged. Since he had supposedly disassociated himself from the crime by fleeing after knocking Friess unconscious, he could not be held liable as an accomplice to murder or rape. On account for his age, officials had not prosecuted him for assault. He had been released to his mother. At his trial, Schreiber said he'd changed his story after learning that if the younger boy was implicated in the murder, he'd be sent to a reform school until his 21st birthday.

On the stand, the younger boy denied all involvement.

Four psychiatrists testified that Schreiber was sane, but intellectually disabled. They said he had the mentality of an 11-year-old. He was in 11th grade, but was rated at the seventh grade level. Nevertheless, Lucas County prosecutor Harry Friberg pushed for a death sentence. He said Schreiber's age, somewhat impoverished background, and learning difficulties did not warrant leniency given the brutality of the crime.

>""Nevermind, and I mean never, should this man be in a position to commit a similar crime again.""

He noted that Schreiber had used a hunting knife, not a pocket knife.

[Schreiber is sentenced](https://imgur.com/a/yohK9xN)

A three-judge panel deliberated for an hour before finding him guilty of first degree murder and sentencing him to death by electrocution. A plea for a second degree murder conviction or at least an attachment of mercy to a first degree murder conviction were rejected. Schreiber had admitted that he stabbed Friess a second time since he thought he'd missed her heart the first time. Upon hearing the sentence, Schreiber dropped his head and closed his eyes. His mother became hysterical and his two sisters sobbed. Schreiber later said the decision felt ""just like they had shoved a knife in me.""

On June 28, 1955, an appellate court confirmed the verdict in a 2-1 decision. On December 14, 1955, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected his appeal and scheduled his execution for January 13, 1956. On December 30, Governor Frank Lausche delayed the execution to March 15 so that Schreiber could ask for clemency. At a hearing in January, defense attorney Marcus L. Friedman told the Ohio Pardons and Parole Commission that Schreiber had been raised on the edge of poverty and never had a real break in his life. Friedman said clemency would be ""the first and last break he'll ever get.""

>""If he gets one now, he will never get another because he will be in prison the rest of his life.""

It's worth noting that this is false.

Life without parole did not become a sentencing option in Ohio until 1993. Any sentence less than death for Schreiber was virtually guaranteed to result in him being paroled in the 1970s or 1980s. That aside, Friedman noted the presence of other mitigating factors, such as Schreiber's age and learning difficulties. However, the panel was unmoved. On March 15, Schreiber lost his last hope of avoiding execution when Governor Lausche said he would not intervene. After counseling with his cabinet and reviewing the case, he announced, ""Based upon a careful study of the evidence in the case of Bernard Schreiber, I find the facts to be of a nature not warranting my intervention. The decisions respectively of the Common Pleas. Appellate and the Supreme Courts will not be disturbed.""",45,1765919529.0,TrueCrimeDiscussion,2,0.94,False

I wanted to try speaking with a psychologist, but every time I try to reach out…I back out. I feel uncomfortable speaking about what I’ve experienced throughout my life to someone. 

I just learned about how flashbacks occur, and I feel like this happens sometimes.

I feel like crying much more than usual. Isolating myself. It feels like no one cares, but then thing is  I am an adult now and should be capable of swallowing this pain. Literally took an edible to feel a bit lighter. So I’d have the motivation to get up and clean. Sometimes I won’t feel as sad. 

Sometimes I go out to get coffee or food just make myself feel something. I just got such a bad grade in a class. My professor replied kinda pissy to a polite email I sent. I changed jobs and the rules are still so nitpicky. 

I try cleaning but my family does not respect it. No matter how good I organize something it gets messy so soon.

When I sit on the couch with my son, reading a book, watching kipper, or whatever, I like to have a cup of coffee with me. 

I drink it all day long even into the evening. It’s sort of my comfort thing.

Problem is, he thinks it’s hilarious to poke the coffee when it’s in my cup, then shake the drops off his finger saying “yucky hot!” (Or at least baby talk equivalent to those words

Hi everyone,

I’ve spent many hours a day on Reddit looking for hope and realistic expectations through other people’s IVF stories, and they helped me tremendously throughout my journey. It only feels right to share mine in hopes it can help someone else.

* 1 no result / low DNA



# Final Thoughts

I was genuinely shocked by the results of ER #2. I expected a repeat of ER #1 since I was repeatedly told my egg quality was very poor. I don’t know if the improvement came from lower stim doses, switching CoQ10 brands, adding melatonin, or a combination of everything.

Before this cycle, I was pessimistic and firmly decided I wouldn’t do a third retrieval. This experience reminded me that **every cycle is different**. One bad round does *not* mean all future rounds will be the same.

I still have a long road ahead, but I’m grateful to still be in the race.

Wishing everyone luck, peace, and baby dust. 🤍✨",15,1765918513.0,40Plus_IVF,8,1.0,False

The exit to the tunnels was smaller than I expected.

Just a square hatch cut into the earth, framed in warped wood, the metal handle eaten with rust. Someone had thrown boards and an old tarp over it, then a layer of dead grass, like the whole thing was embarrassed of itself.

Nick shoved it up from below with his shoulder. The night air hit my face: cold, clean, so sharp it made my teeth ache. I hadn’t realized how long it had been since I felt fresh air.

We crawled out into the yard like something the ground was spitting back up.

The farmhouse loomed ahead, black against the sky, windows orange with lamplight.

Nick slammed the hatch shut with both hands. The sound was too loud in the quiet field.

I wedged a rusted rake through the handles, sealing it the only way we could.

Somewhere below, something thudded against the hatch once. Just once.

The wood jumped under my hands.

We froze.

Nothing else came. The night went back to crickets and distant frogs, the normal sounds of a place that had no idea what pulsed underneath it.

Nick let out a breath that shuddered at the end.

“We get El,” he said. “Then we run.”

My legs shook when I straightened. Hunger and exhaustion and whatever the hell that water carried all braided together in my veins. But I nodded.

“We get El,” I echoed. “Then we run.”

We headed for the house.

The grass tugged at my ankles, wet and cold, like the field was trying to hold on. The porch steps creaked under our weight, familiar in a way that made me sick. We’d arrived here once with bags and jokes and Hailey alive.

Nick tried the back door.

It was unlocked.

The kitchen smelled like it always had: coffee gone stale, old grease, dish soap. The overhead light hummed. For a second, if you didn’t look too closely, it could’ve been any farmhouse in any nowhere town.

Silas sat in one of the kitchen chairs, knife resting flat across his knees.

He grinned when he saw us. He’d been waiting. 

“Well, shit,” he said. “Rats learned to climb.”

Nick stepped in front of me before I could think.

“Move,” he told me, without looking back.

Silas stood, rolling his shoulders, the knife spinning easily in his hand now. “Mae said you boys had spirit. Guess she was right.”

I tried to angle past them.

Silas shifted to block me.

“Ah-ah,” he said. “Nobody goes near the gir—”

Nick charged into him.

It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t clean. It was just a straight, exhausted, rage-weighted tackle that caught Silas in the gut and drove him into the counter. The knife clattered to the floor, skidding under the kitchen table.

They both dove for it.

“Go!” Nick shouted, fingers locked in Silas’s shirt.

I didn’t argue.

The hallway felt narrower than I remembered. Every family photo on the wall seemed to watch as I ran past them.

Elenor’s door sat near the end, the wood scarred with tiny scratches near the handle.

Mae was already there.

She stood in front of the door like she’d been expecting me, hands folded at her waist, gray hair braided neat, expression as calm as if she were waiting for the kettle to boil.

“Alex,” she said. “Dear, you’re gonna want to slow down and think about—”

I didn’t slow down.

My fist connected with her jaw.

There was a sharp, ugly crack, like a branch snapping under too much weight. Mae’s head snapped sideways. Her body followed in a boneless sort of way, skirts flaring as she hit the floor. She crumpled against the wall, breath knocked clean out of her, eyes rolling up for a second before she blinked hard, trying to make the world focus.

I stepped over her.

Her hand twitched toward my ankle, then fell back, useless.

I shoved Elenor’s door open.

Her room was exactly as I’d last seen it.

The bed was made, white linens smoothed flat. A mug of tea steamed on the nightstand, curling its breath into the air. There was a book open in her hands. She sat cross-legged on the mattress, back straight, hair brushed until it shone.

She looked up.

“Alex—” she gasped. “How—what are you doing here?”

I must’ve looked like something that had crawled out of a grave. I could feel the grit on my skin, the tunnel water soaked into my clothes, the stink of the heart still clinging to my hair. My chest heaved. My hands shook.

“I told you,” I said, breath coming in ragged pieces. “I told you I’d get us out.”

“Alex, I—”

I didn’t let her finish.

I crossed the room in three steps, grabbed her by the waist, and hauled her off the bed. The book fell from her hands and hit the floor face-down. Tea sloshed over the rim of the mug, staining the white wood of the nightstand.

She made a small sound of protest—more surprise than resistance—but she didn’t fight me. Her fingers curled in my shirt instead, holding on.

“We’re leaving,” I said. “Now.”

We didn’t get far.

Ruth and Jonah stood at the end of the hall.

Ruth’s apron was spotless, her hands lifted in a slow, careful gesture, like she was approaching a spooked horse. Jonah’s face had gone white, his eyes darting between us and Mae on the ground.

“Alex,” Ruth said, voice soft and level. “Baby, put her down. You’re scaring her.”

“C’mon man,” Jonah added, “let’s all just take a breath.”

I shifted, putting my body fully between them and Elenor. She ended up pressed into the corner where the walls met, my arm across her stomach, holding her in place behind me.

Nobody moved.

The house creaked somewhere. The kettle hissed in the kitchen, unattended.

Ruth took two small steps forward. “You don’t want to do this. You know you don’t.”

“Back up,” I said.

My voice sounded strange. Thin. Stretched.

Jonah tried for a reassuring smile and got halfway there before it broke. “There’s no world where you get out that door alive if you keep this up. Move away from El, and we’ll talk about—”

“Don’t call her El, you piece of shi—”

A shout split the house.

Nick.

It came from the kitchen: a raw, wordless yell, followed by the crash of bodies hitting furniture.

The sound traveled down the hallway like a physical thing.

Nick barrelled into the hallway a second later.

Ruth turned just in time to take his shoulder full-force. Nick drove her into the wall, a blade leading. The knife slid into the side of her neck with a wet, ugly sound.

He was bleeding from a cut along his cheekbone, shirt torn, one sleeve hanging by a thread. His hair was slick with sweat and Stillwater and someone else’s blood.

He held Silas’s knife.

Jonah screamed.

He yanked Nick off her like he weighed nothing, throwing him hard enough that Nick hit the opposite wall and slid down in a smear of blood. But Jonah didn’t chase him.

He dropped to his knees beside Ruth, hands scrambling uselessly at the wound in her throat as dark, viscous red poured between his fingers.

“Ruth—Ruthie—no, no, no—” he babbled, his voice breaking. He tore at his belt for a battered flask, hands shaking so hard he almost dropped it.

He uncapped it with his teeth and poured Stillwater into her mouth.

She gagged and gurgled, trying to swallow.

Jonah looked up at us, eyes blazing with terror and fury.

“You boys have no idea what you’re doing,” he said.

Nick staggered to his feet, clutching his shoulder, knife still in his grip. His eyes found mine. Found Elenor. Found the hall beyond.

“Let's go,” he rasped.

We went.

The living room closed in around us, swallowing us forward.

Furniture flashed by.

The front door waited ahead—freedom hanging by its hinges.

We hit the entryway at a dead sprint, holding Eleanor between us.

Then we froze.

The door wasn’t escape.

It was a dead end.

It was Harlan.

He stood between us and the door like he’d been carved from the frame itself: shoulders squared, hands loose at his sides, boots planted in the hardwood. A wall with a pulse.

Nick and I skidded to a stop so fast Elenor stumbled between us. Her breath hitched against my arm.

The house felt smaller than it ever had, shrinking around the four of us like lungs exhaling.

Harlan’s eyes never left me.

He didn’t say a word.

Nick tried to push past him: quick, desperate, the ghost of a stab behind the motion.

Harlan caught him by the shoulder and shoved him back—not cruelly. Not even angrily. Just firmly. With the certainty of someone who knew exactly how this was going to end.

I lunged next, but he swept his arm in front of me like he was brushing dust from a table. Not aggressive. Not defensive.

Just immovable.

Behind us, footsteps gathered. The house filled.

Abel appeared first, as if he’d simply stepped out from behind a curtain. He clasped his hands behind his back, beard neatly combed, eyes gentle in a way that made my skin crawl.

Mae limped in next, one hand pressed to her jaw, glaring daggers through the pain. She kept her distance from me.

Jonah followed, Ruth slumped across his shoulders. She was barely conscious. Stillwater mixed with blood ran from her neck and down onto his back.

Silas was nowhere.

Abel surveyed the room like a pastor about to begin a sermon.

“Boys,” he said softly, “there’s no need for all this noise. Nobody wants to hurt you.”

Nick barked a humorless laugh. His shirt was torn, blood splashed down his front. “You’ve done nothing *but* hurt us.”

Abel sighed, like he was disappointed in a child. “You misunderstand. We preserve. We keep what the land chooses. And it seems…” His gaze slid to Elenor. “It seems the land chose her.”

Elenor’s fingers dug into my shirt. She still hadn’t said a word.

Abel lifted a hand.

The room stilled.

“You can’t win,” he continued. “Let her go. Come away from the door, and we’ll settle this without any more loss. We’re a family. We take care of our own.”

Nick’s jaw clenched. “We’re not your fucking family.”

Abel offered a small, patient smile. “All who partake in Stillwater become part of the root. You drank from it, did you not?”

A noise split the air before I could answer.

A raw, animal scream.

High. Sharp. Familiar.

It came from outside.

Something hit the window beside the door: glass shattered, curtains whipped inward. The grandfather crashed through in a shower of shards and splintered wood.

He landed on top of me before I could move.

His weight drove the air from my lungs. His hands slammed down on either side of my head, thick nails biting into the floorboards. His face hovered inches from mine: skin stretched thin, veins like roots pulsing under it, mouth hanging open wider than any human jaw should allow.

The sound he made wasn’t speech. It was hunger.

His breath—wet, rattling—hit my face.

His hand rose, claws ready to plunge straight into my chest.

“Ezekiel!” Abel’s voice cracked like a whip.

Everything froze.

Ezekiel halted, jaws suspended mid-snarl, pupils blown wide as if he were listening to a command delivered through bone.

That moment of stillness was all Nick needed.

He lunged behind Mae, one arm clamping around her throat, the other yanking Silas’s knife up to her temple. She gasped, body going rigid against him.

Nick’s voice shook with exhaustion and fury.

“This one matters to you, right?”

Ezekiel lowered his claws an inch.

Nick pressed the blade harder. Mae whimpered.

“What happens if I destroy her brain, huh? Stillwater fix that?!?”

Abel lifted both hands.

“Son… son, listen to me. Put the knife down. You don’t want to do something you can’t take back.”

Nick’s grip trembled.

Abel stepped closer.

“You let her go,” he said gently, “and I swear—on the land, on the root, on my blood—your brother walks out that door alive.”

“Bullshit.”

“Nicholas. Listen. Put the knife down, and your brother lives. You will both walk out of here.” Abel’s tone never wavered. “But if you kill her, Ezekiel will rip your brother apart. Right here. Right now.”

“Nick—don’t,” I rasped.

Nick looked at me.

And something in him cracked.

He was so tired.

So broken.

His heart didn’t have anything left to burn.

He loosened the knife.

Mae inhaled sharply.

Abel nodded, relieved.

“There you go. There you—”

A wet sound cut him off.

Nick stiffened.

A thin shard of glass jutted from the side of his neck.

Blood pooled at his collarbone, spilling down in a steady line.

He swayed once, twice—then collapsed. The knife skittered out of his hand.

Behind him stood Eleanor, eyes huge and wet, bloodied hands shaking so badly she could barely keep one over her mouth. The other clutched her belly.

Nick’s head dropped beside mine on the floor. His eyes were open, but he was already gone from them.

“Thank you, dear,” Mae said softly, her hand shaking as she wiped the blood from her temple. “He would have killed me,” she folded Elenor into her arms, “I’m sure of it.”

My breath fell apart in my chest. The world went thin and sharp around the edges.

“Nick…” I whimpered. 

Elenor left Mae and stepped forward, crying openly now.

“Alex,” she said, voice breaking, “I’m pregnant.”

I didn’t look up.

“Alex… I can’t go back. I can’t go to some apartment and pretend this baby is yours, or his, or—I can’t do that.”

She pressed a shaking hand to her stomach, as if steadying the future inside her.

“The family will take care of me,” she whispered. “They’ll take care of us. They don’t care where the baby came from. They don’t care about any of it. They just… want us. They want us to stay.”

She took one trembling step toward me.

“We could stay,” she said softly. “We could live here. We could live forever. No more running. No more fear.” Her voice cracked. “Please, Alex. Please stay with me. Don’t make me do this alone. This is the only way we can be a family. I— we can’t go back.”

Her eyes drifted to Nick on the floor—blood spreading beneath him.

“Oh God… Alex, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” she choked out. “I was just trying—he—he—” Her breath collapsed into sobs. “Alex, can you say something? Please. Just say something.”

I couldn’t look at her. 

I couldn’t look at Nick.

My vision tunneled to the ceiling fan above me, spinning slowly, mocking how still everything else had become.

I laughed.

It tore out of me in jagged pieces, sharp enough to hurt.

It wasn’t humor.

It wasn’t hysteria.

It was the only sound my body had left.

I laughed until my ribs hurt. The only other sound was Elenor sobbing and begging for forgiveness.

“I loved you,” I said finally, looking up at her.

For a moment, she broke. Her mouth trembled. Her shoulders folded inward. She looked like she was about to fall to her knees beside me.

“Alex—” she whispered.

The room held still. Even the air felt afraid to move.

Then Ezekiel lunged.

Claws ripped toward my chest.

But they never reached me.

Harlan crashed into him from the side with a roar that didn’t sound human. He seized Ezekiel by the neck and slammed his head into the wall.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

Blood sprayed. Bone cracked. Roots tore free from Ezekiel’s jaw as Harlan smashed until nothing recognizable remained.

The family screamed. Mae sobbed. Jonah nearly dropped Ruth.

Harlan stood over what was left of Ezekiel, chest heaving, hands trembling, drenched in black, viscous liquid—more Stillwater than blood.

He turned to me.

His face twisted—not in anger.

In grief.

“There’s been enough death here.”

He bent, hooked his arms under mine, and lifted me like I weighed nothing. My feet barely touched the ground before he hoisted me over his shoulder.

I didn’t fight him.

I didn’t have anything left to fight with.

As he ran for the door, I twisted just enough to see behind us.

The family huddled together.

Mae clutched her bleeding jaw.

Jonah held Ruth upright as Stillwater pooled around their feet.

Abel didn’t move. He only watched Harlan, like this was something he’d always expected to see.

And then Elenor. Hand on her belly. Tears streaking her face. Looking at me like she’d just ripped out her own heart.

\*\*\*

The door slammed behind us and the night swallowed everything else.

Harlan didn’t set me down so much as drop me into the passenger seat and slam his own door before I could get my breath back. The engine groaned awake. Gravel spit behind the tires. The farmhouse shrank in the side mirror until it was just a bruise against the dark.

I didn’t register anything except the direction we were going: away from Elenor.

My body moved before my brain did.

I threw myself at him.

“TURN AROUND!”

My fist cracked against his shoulder. Then his jaw. I didn’t aim. I just wanted him *hurt*. 

“TURN THE FUCK AROUND—ELENOR—WE HAVE TO—”

He didn’t block me. Didn’t shout. Didn’t even look away from the road.

He let me hit him again. And again.

My knuckles split on something—bone or tooth or the metal buckle of his overalls.

“I CAN FIX THIS—LET ME—TAKE ME BACK—”

A sound ripped out of me that didn’t belong to language. It didn’t even sound human.

Harlan’s voice finally came, low and steady.

“I can’t take you back.”

I clawed at the wheel. The truck fishtailed. He caught the wheel with one hand—a giant, work-scarred hand—and held the truck steady while my nails dug into his skin.

“STOP—STOP THE TRUCK—LET ME OUT—LET ME—”

“No.” Still even. Still awful in its certainty. “Not while you’re like this.”

I hit him until I couldn’t lift my arms anymore.

At some point my body folded in on itself and slid down the door, forehead pressed to cold glass. I shook so hard the whole truck seemed to vibrate with me.

“Nick…” I heard myself whisper.

And then quieter: “El…”

I don’t remember the next hour.

Just the truck, humming like a held breath.

Just the white of Harlan’s knuckles on the wheel.

Just the taste of blood in my mouth.

When I finally blinked enough to see straight, the road had changed. Forest had thinned into fields. The moon was lower, dragging slow across the sky.

Harlan’s reflection caught in the window. His face was set like stone: jaw locked, shoulders squared, eyes on the horizon.

“Where are you taking us?” I rasped.

The words tasted like iron. Like loss.

Harlan’s hands tightened on the wheel—not because he was nervous, but like he was bracing for me to erupt again.

“Away,” he said.

“That’s not an answer.”

“No,” he agreed softly. “It ain’t.”

We drove in silence. A long one. Heavy enough that I could hear every bump of the tires against the road like a heartbeat.

Houses appeared on the horizon.

A town.

Lights in windows. People inside.

Normal.

My breath hitched. I pushed myself upright.

“There.” I pointed with a shaking hand. “Stop. Pull over. Call someone. The police—anyone—they’ll help—they—”

Harlan didn’t even slow down.

“Not here,” he said. “Not them.”

“Why?” I felt my voice tear at the end. “Why not!?”

“They’d take you right back,” he said matter-of-factly. “Family’s got hands in things around here. Deep hands. Quiet ones. You go to the sheriff? You’d be in the back of a truck to the farm by morning.”

I stared at him, numb and furious.

“Then what?” I spat. “What, we just drive until the gas runs out?”

“If we need to.”

“And Elenor?” The rage surged again so fast it made the edges of my vision go white. “We left her—WE LEFT HER THERE—”

Harlan didn’t flinch. Didn’t defend himself. He carried my words like they were supposed to hurt.

“I know,” he said quietly. “And I’m sorry.”

Those words hit harder than the shove into the truck, harder than the night air in my lungs.

I swallowed hard. “Why did you even help me?”

Another long stretch of highway passed before he answered.

His voice was smaller when it came.

“I remember what it felt like,” he said, eyes still on the road. “Knowin’ there was nothing I could do. Knowin’ she wasn’t comin’ back.”

I turned my head toward him slowly.

“Who?”

“My wife.” Barely a whisper. “Clara’s mama.”

I didn’t speak.

He kept his hands on the wheel, thumbs pressed tight like he was holding on to the past through the steering column.

“Met her in town,” he said. “’Bout sixty years ago now, if you can believe it. Pretty thing. Real smart. Had a laugh that’d warm a barn in winter.” He smiled, sadly, remembering. “She took a shine to me. Don’t know why. I was just workin’ the orchards then.”

The truck hummed, steady and low.

“She wanted a place to settle. Somewhere quiet.”

He let out a breath. “Thought the farm seemed peaceful. I didn’t know better. Not then.”

My nails dug into my palms.

“She didn’t either,” he said. “Not till she started showin’ with Clara. That’s when she heard ’em callin’ the baby theirs. When she saw how the land don’t let go of what it touches.”

My throat burned.

“She tried to leave,” I murmured.

He nodded once.

“Three of us did. Her, me, the baby. We got caught before we hit the treeline.”

His voice wavered for the first time.

“Then they killed her.”

Silence swallowed the cab.

Every breath in my chest felt too sharp, like breathing through broken glass.

“They spared me ’cause I was useful,” Harlan said. “And ’cause Clara needed someone who loved her.” He swallowed. “I stayed for her. Only reason I stayed.”

A long beat. His hands gripping the wheel.

“And now she’s gone too.”

I didn’t know what to say. Didn’t know if I wanted to say anything at all. But the hatred that had been boiling inside me… it shifted. Not into forgiveness. Not into softness. Into something empty. Like there was nothing left to burn.

We passed the town entirely.

Houses disappeared.

Road widened into open dark.

Harlan didn’t speak again.

I didn’t either.

Just the hum of the engine. The ache in my chest. The ruin of everything behind us.

Hours slipped by like water through shaking fingers.

Only then, when we were swallowed by mountains, when the moon had shifted its place in the sky, did Harlan’s voice return, quiet and worn thin. 

“Almost there.”

I looked at him.

His jaw was different. Looser. Skin sagging where it hadn’t sagged before. The line of his neck mottled with age spots.

My breath stuttered.

“Harlan,” I said. “What’s happening to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Hey—look at me—what’s wrong with your face—why do you look—”

He cleared his throat. It sounded like leaves scraping together.

“Ain’t had a drink,” he repeated. “Not since last night.”

It hit me all at once.

“You’re aging,” I whispered.

He didn’t nod. Didn’t deny it.

His eyes stayed straight on the road.

“…S’what happens.”

He didn’t speak again.

The road wound upward into the mountains, the kind of climb that made the engine strain and the world fall away behind us. Pines thickened around the shoulders of the highway, black trunks spaced like watchmen. The air outside the cracked window grew colder, sharper.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Not from fear.

From the way everything inside me had come undone.

After what felt like another hour—maybe more, maybe less—Harlan flicked the turn signal.

“Here we are,” he murmured, mostly to himself.

The truck turned down a narrow gravel road. Stones spit and skittered beneath the tires. The headlights cut across a small clearing; just enough space for the truck to park crooked beside a lone oak tree.

A massive one. Wide-limbed. Stubborn. Beautiful.

Harlan put the truck in park. But he didn’t move.

His hands stayed on the wheel a long time, fingers curled and pale. The skin around his knuckles looked different: thinner, stretched over bone. His hair, dark just hours ago, glinted with silver in the moonlight coming through the windshield.

“Harlan,” I said again. “Talk to me.”

He finally let go of the wheel. His hands dropped into his lap, wrinkled and old. When he turned toward me, something inside my chest yanked tight.

He looked seventy. Eighty. Older.

But his eyes… they were still him.

“I’m bein’ selfish,” he said softly. “Bringin’ you here. But I ain’t got long. You deserve… some truth. ’Fore I go.”

He opened the truck door.

Cold wind rushed in, raising goosebumps along my arms. I watched him circle the hood, moving slower now, each step deliberate like he was feeling the ground beneath his feet in a new body.

I forced myself out of the cab and followed him toward the oak.

The view hit me like a punch.

The mountain range stretched out beneath us, pale blue and silver under the moon, peaks jagged and unreal. The land rolled away in waves, so big it made everything inside me feel small. Insignificant. Temporary.

Harlan lowered himself to sit with his back against the oak. It took effort. His knees didn’t bend right. His breath shook.

But when he settled, some peace found him. Not joy. Just… relief.

“Clara’s mama brought me here once,” he said quietly, running a hand over the grass beside him. “Said it was her favorite place in the world. Said the land felt honest up here. Clean.”

He swallowed.

“I ain’t been back since.”

The wind tugged at his shirt. The moonlight softened the deep lines on his face. His eyes glistened: not with tears, but with memory.

“I used to picture bringin’ Clara here,” he continued, voice fraying at the edges. “Showin’ her the ridge. The sunrise. Teachin’ her how to track elk. How to build a fire tall enough to keep away the cold.”

His voice broke, barely, but I heard it.

“She never got to see any of it.”

I sank down beside him without thinking. Maybe his grief was the only thing that felt real. Maybe I had nothing else to give. Maybe, through everything, all I could do was look at the view.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered. It was all I had left.

He nodded once.

“Me too.”

The moon climbed higher. The mountains brightened. Harlan’s shadows grew deeper, skin loosening around his jaw, his hair turning almost white right in front of me.

“How long?” I asked.

His breath hitched, shallow and effortful. He stared at the horizon for a long moment.

“He was the first, y’know” He said at last. “Ezekiel. If you think I got old… hell. That bastard had centuries on me.” He let out a thin, humorless laugh. “More Stillwater than man by the end. Killing him…” He swallowed. “Killing him was a mercy. Maybe the only good thing I ever did.”

He looked out at the mountains one last time. His eyes softened in a way I hadn’t seen before.

“I wish I could’ve taken you here, Clara,” he murmured.

Then he closed his eyes.

His chest lifted once—steep, shuddering—then eased down.

And didn’t rise again.

The wind moved through the oak, shaking loose a handful of dry leaves that drifted down and settled against his shoulder like a blanket.

I sat there a long time.

Long enough for the moon to slide across the sky. 

Long enough for everything to feel too wide, too empty.

When I finally stood, my legs barely held me. I made it to the truck. The engine started right away.

I didn’t look back. Not because I couldn’t bear it. 

Because if I did, I’d want to stay and die right there beside him.

\*\*\*

It’s been a year.

A year of pretending sunlight feels normal.

A year of sleeping with the lights on.

A year of waiting for something under the floorboards to breathe.

Coming home didn’t feel like coming home. It felt like slipping into a life I’d already stepped out of. My friends asked about the *trip*. So did my boss. Even the barista smiled at me like I’d just come back from a honeymoon.

“How was your vacation?”

“Where’s Elenor?”

“Did you two elope?”

“You guys really dropped off the grid!”

I didn’t understand any of it until someone showed me my own text messages.

Messages I didn’t write.

Whole conversations. Weeks of them. 

Telling friends and coworkers that El and I were taking time away. That we needed space from work. That we were “off the map for a bit.”

That we were happy. That I was fine.

They even messaged my landlord. Broke my lease for me. Told him I wouldn’t be coming back.

Crazy what a family like theirs can do when they have your phone for a month.

I went to the police. Of course I did.

I sat in a gray room and told them everything: every impossible detail, every inch of tunnel and heartbeat and Stillwater. They looked at me like I was crazy.

“Son… are you sure you’re not confused about what happened?”

A week later they called me back in.

Said they had “verified information.”

Said Elenor had contacted them. 

Said she confirmed everything was fine.

Said she and I had decided not to get married after all.

Said she wanted privacy.

They showed me the voicemail.

It was her voice. The cadence. The softness. It made me feel homesick.

“Alex, please stop. I’m okay. I’m happy. I don’t want to be found.”

After that, the police stopped returning my calls.

I stopped going.

I moved in with Brian—my old coworker.

He didn’t ask for explanations. 

Didn’t ask why I woke up screaming.

Didn’t ask why I checked the sink every morning to make sure the water ran clear.

He just… let me exist.

Even when I pushed him away.

Even when I forgot to eat for days.

Even when I sat in the shower fully clothed because the sound of running water made me shake.

He stayed anyway.

Sometimes I think he’s the only good thing left in my life.

Sometimes I think he’s the only reason I didn’t go back sooner.

But a year is a long time to outrun something that lives in your bones.

I feel it now, that hum under the skin. That tug. That slow, patient pulse.

I dream of roots crawling through my windows.

I dream of Elenor’s voice through the floorboards. 

Not pleading. 

Calling. 

Calling me home.

Maybe the Stillwater marked me.

Maybe it never let me go.

Maybe it’s something simpler.

Maybe I miss her.

But now I sit on the road that just ends, writing down everything I can before the words stop mattering.

The night is cold.

The moon is full.

And it’s time for me to return to Stillwater.",2,1765918336.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I lie thinking of my dear friend Samuel. Though the ruling was finalized, I fear that something was amiss. Neither I or anyone close to him, think that the verdict is error-free. and I intended to find it. I wait for the morning sun to dawn the waking hour. and the bell from the clocktower to toll 6.

tap tap tap of the door, a oil light shines from unter the doorway. as a white note slips in after. I get up from my tabletop, pick up the note. and opened the door, peering out from  my room, left and right, there are no signs of human existence in the blackend halls. I closed the door and opened the letter.

""it wasn't suicide"" written in dark red ink. Though I knew these words reign true, I find myself baffled at the sight on these writings. I sit and study the words, ponder what can be done

as the bells toll dawn, I slipped my clothes on, and made my way to the dining hall. where I found Mr. Edmund sitting at the farthest half of the mile wide table.

""ahh, how was your night my boy?"" he asked.

""Just fine, Mr. Edmund, thank you again for your kind hospitality.""

""Don't mention it my dear boy.""

I nodded my head and began my feast. Eggs, Bacon, and assorted fruits. with the morning coffee.

""might I ask what your plan is for today?""

""I will be heading to the mortuary to claim the body and send it off to his family back in Charlotte.""

""Sounds good lad, I would accompany you, but this old man doesn't get out much these days."" He said slightly chuckling, slightly coughing.

""that's quite alright sir, I'm sure you have more pressing matters to attend to anyways"" I replied.

the day was bright though few clouds overcast throughout. children run a muck, running, sliding, and jumping to the nightly formed puddles, despite it only being 7-8 o'clock, the loony town drunks are already in the bar drinking their lives away. or maybe that just hadn't left.

I made my way into the morgue. meeting Mr. Buchanan. ""Hello, I am here to claim the man that arrived here last week, names Samuel Edins.""  he didn't say anything as he reached into his drawer  and pull several sheets of paper, and a felt tip pen. ""sign here, and here, up here, and finally here. Thank  you."" stacking the papers into a cabinet and walking to the door on the left. ""follow me please."" we walked to the room, where Samuel lie lifeless. though all the details of Mr. Edmunds testimonial were accurate. There were slightly more noticeable puncture wounds in the legs and arms. though the most striking, indeed was the sizable chunk ripped from his abdomen. ""fuck"" was the only word I could mutter out. ""was he a friend of yours..?"" the man asked. ""Yes, though after the war we grew quite distant.""

""I am sorry for your loss."" he said.

""might I ask what you think happened?"" I asked. I watched the man think for a few seconds before he muttered any word. ""If I were a betting man, I would say, It look like he was mauled to death. the wounds in the lower legs look to be canine, Like a large wolf attacked him. in fact I'm sure of it.""

he went back into his study for a while. sounds of rummaging through documents and other assorted papers, being pulled around. I looked back at Samuel. ""remember that time when we took Malolos, and we thought the war was as good as over? then a spray bullet grazed your arm."" I said chuckling a little bit. ""God your face was priceless, I wish I got a photo of that, for a split second you looked like you were gonna cry.""

The lights flickered slightly more, slowly at first, but gradually started to flicker faster and faster, with each flicker, Samuel's eye opened more and more, his lifeless body began to rise, the lights were pulsating faster and faster, he was on his feet pursuing me, embalming fluid leaking from his wounds, the corpse walked like a goat walking on its hind legs. with each step, the ankle on the left side began to bend more and more, his head moved in the dark to the sounds of cracks and breaking of recently unused bones. his eyes, fell to a ghostly white, as gravity forced them down. organs and flesh began to drop to the floor, being dragged by the part still attached to his body. I fell to the back of the room, toppling over carts and gurney. though he was slow. his pace was constant. he opened his mouth like he was trying to find his voice after his vocal cords were ripped out. with a blood filled mouth I could make out ""the deal.""

""okay right here."" the man said, out of an instant I was standing in my original position, Samuel was still lying on the stretcher dead. and the lights were glowing a constant glow. ""a man in 1898 was found mauled in his home, in Bedford Virginia. You see these bitemarks, it's exactly the same."" I stood there dumbfounded for a long moment, what in the hell is going on with me?

""That's fascinating,"" I said blankly still looking at the corpse that lay before me. though I came here to collect his belongings, now I'm gripped to the fact that I have witnessed proof of the supernatural, or I am beginning to go insane. the underline curiosity had gripped me more than the studies I have been a part of.

""I have to go."" I said and quickly turned away. before the man could mutter a word, I exited the building and walked to the nearest church. and sat foot in the pew nearest to the pastor's chair. a tall black man named Pastor Ankins came out to greet me. ""Hello my child, What can I do for you this fine day?""

""Sir, there is something I must ask you""

""and what are they?""

""My friend often made these remarks, while we were in the war. He would often say, ""I'd sell my soul for some decent rations"", or ""I'd sell my soul to get out of here."" but one time he looked serious, he told me his wife was sick. Tuberculosis. he walked out of camp one night. He didn't come back until the next morning. looking grim and pale white. when we were sent back to america. His wife was there to greet us. perfectly healthy.""  I explained. ""do you believe in that kind of stuff?""

""Though I have not personally seen it, I can tell you. I believe it is very real. and your friend could have very well done it. where is your friend now?""

""Dead. mauled to death in his room up at the manor.""

""oh my."" he said in shock. ""look I will talk with others and maybe I can give you more answers."" he said.

""thank you father"" I shook his hand and left the church. and made my way back into the manor.

When I arrived, back to the manor. I seeked out Mr. Edmund, I found him walking around the back of the estate, tending to his garden. ""Ahh, how did everything go, my boy?""

""uhh, everything went well sir, thanks for asking. may I ask, What was the nature of Samuels visit?"" I asked

""uhh, well he was seeking out early Catholic and Christian writings. though I could never get an answer from him."" he said puzzled. ""come to think about it, I never knew him as the religious type.""

''do you think you could show me the books?"" I asked

""I'm a bit busy right now, I will send Elizabeth to help you find what you need."" he said

""thank you sir."" I turned and walked away back into the manor.

1pocupw,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1pocupw/colonoscopy_experience_findings/,Colonoscopy experience & findings,"Last Thursday (4 days prior to the procedure), I stopped taking my iron pills (325mg), which was technically too late but ended up not being an issue!

On Friday and Saturday, I started the low residue diet and felt like garbage.... I normally eat a ton of fiber and I felt like my digestive tract was allowed to a screeching halt. Sunday, I had scrambled eggs and white bread today for breakfast, and for lunch and dinner, I had soup and fiber-less crackers.

Monday was clear liquids day, and I started with coffee with a ton of brown sugar to compensate for the lack of milk. I had lots of fat free bone broth and Italian ices. My instructions didn't say to take dulcolax, but I took two tablets at 2pm because I was nervous. Around that time a nurse called to ask if I had any last minute questions, so I told her that I was very scared of vomiting the prep up- she told me to start before my scheduled time (3pm instead of 4pm) and that it was okay to start the second dose early too (1am instead of 3:40am). So from 3-4:15, I drank 15oz of the magnesium citrate and chased it with blue Gatorade, which was yucky. I tried ginger ale, but honestly ginger ale tastes like I have a stomach bug, so I couldn't stand it. The next hour or two was the worst- incessant burbling and bloating and feeling nauseated. I held it down though. It took way longer to work than I thought it was going to- four hours had passed and not much had happened, but then the evacuations got increasingly liquidy. Between 10 and 1, I tried to sleep, but kept having to get up to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes.

In no time, it was 1am. Between 1 and 2, I had another 12-13oz of magnesium citrate chased with blue Gatorade- it was supposed to be 15 ounces, but I couldn't psychologically handle that last bit. For the next few hours, I slept fitfully, still going to the bathroom way more often than I wanted to. I think somewhere in there I actually slept for a full hour and it felt magical. I set my alarm for 5:40, the last time I could drink water- when it went off, I figured another 8 ounces and went back to sleep. At some point, I couldn't sleep anymore and took a truly glorious shower before going in to the hospital. 

Results? Only a small hemerrhoid and they don't want to see me again for 10 years! There was no official rating of my prep, but based on the clear pictures from the procedure, clear stools I was passing, and the fact that they don't want me back for 10 years, I think it was excellent. 

Miscellaneous tips:

*Choose a better chaser than blue Gatorade 

*Dabbing with toilet paper and then dabbing with wipes minimized pain 

*Don't panic if it takes a while. I didn't get clear stools until after starting the second dose of prep

*Eating lightly on Sunday made the first dose of prep surprisingly not horrible.

*The worst part of the whole experience was the feeling for an hour or so after taking the prep. The pooping was fine (if annoying)",2,1765917384.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

I’ve tried to quit probably 5 or 6 times in the last couple of years, and every single time I tried the ""rip the bandaid off"" method, I crashed and burned.

You guys know the feeling. Day 1 is okay, but Day 2 feels like someone is hammering a nail behind your left eye. I’d get so useless at work and snappy with my partner that I’d just cave and grab an espresso, then feel like a failure.

I realized I just don't have the willpower to self-regulate a taper (I always cheat), and my body physically cannot handle the cold turkey shock.

I eventually found this app called CalmCup (I think it’s just calmcup.app?). I was looking for a tracker but this one basically builds a taper schedule for you. I honestly didn't think it would work because I usually delete these kinds of apps after a week, but having something else do the math for me was actually what I needed.

It basically just lowered my allowance a tiny bit every day.

* First week I was still drinking coffee, just a bit less.
* Then I had to switch to matcha/tea to stay under the limit.
* Then down to one weak tea.
* Then zero.

Because it took me like 4 weeks to get to zero, I didn't get the migraines. Not even once. I felt a little tired/bored in the afternoons, but I was functional.

I’ve been completely off for 10 days now. The vivid dreams are insane (in a good way) and it’s weird not waking up with that subtle panic/anxiety in my chest.

Anyway, I see a lot of people here advocating for cold turkey, but if you’ve failed at that a bunch of times like I did, don't feel bad about dragging it out over a month. Tapering was the only way I could actually make it stick without ruining my life for a week.

It currently runs locally and with expo go to test on android and hasn't been published yet



The Stack (The Good Stuff):

* Frontend: React Native (Expo SDK 54) + TypeScript + Expo Router.
* Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL). We aren't doing simple ""radius math"" in JS; I’ve implemented PostGIS with spatial indexes for lightning-fast, scalable location search.
* State: TanStack Query v5 (local-first architecture).
* UI: Custom design system (4pt grid), Reanimated, Haptics, FlashList.
* AI Workflow: Heavily using Cursor/Claude/Gemini to brainstorm functionality, write code generate migrations, write tests, and refactor components.

The Core Features (Already Built and tested✅):

* The Quadrants: Intent-based filtering (Move, Mind, Chill, Event).
* Skill & Vibe Sliders: Match / find / meet based on intensity/skill (Newbie vs. Expert) and social energy (Silent vs. Chatty). eg: looking for a silent study partner or a chatty walking buddy
* Beacons: Real-time, spontaneous ""I'm here right now, let's get coffee"" map signals
* Wingman Mode: Pair up with a friend to find another pair (2v2 matching). Safety in numbers
* Friends and followers functionality (search for new friends within 25km that also love running and movies - be notified when someone you follow plans an activity you might want to join)
* chat (direct, group, session based,...), notifications,...
* Extensive profiles with interests for matching/searching and privacy settings
* translated into 3 languages (English - Dutch - French) but easily extendable with all keys in place

What I’m Looking For:

1. Validation: Does this architecture , ux/ui , user flows, concept make sense to you? Validate rest of the road map and priorities before and after go live
2. Someone with (social) mobile app deploy experience with all it's pitfalls (security, scalability, privacy, ...)
3. Someone with great ideas for monetisation
4. I'm from Belgium and speak Dutch/English as preferred languages

the goal is to make some money at some point and at the very least cover the costs (supabase, mapbox api, google api, ...) and then sell it for a bazillion dollars :D

I’m also very diverse in activities - hiking, nature, coffee, good food, movies, drinking, playing pool, smoking weed, you name it and I enjoy it.


BUT I HAVE NO FRIENDS/ PLANS FOR THE BEST TIME OF THE YEAR. It’s kind off really sad :(

1poclmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1poclmh/help_kindly_say_no/,Help! Kindly say no.,"Help! How do I gently say no to my MIL?

I am newly married and have been together with my husband for a total of 5 years. I still feel very uncomfortable with his parents. I have planned a shin-dig for christmas because they were out of town for Thanksgiving. I had planned to just have cocoa and desserts with lighting up the fire pit outside...nothing extravagant just making sure we are all together. His family usually goes all out whether it's an exuberant amount of gifts ( all adults ) or they have a costly coffee from somewhere and do like an educational lecture on how to brew it and such...his brother asked for expensive cocoa. (I have no problem telling him no- im doing just regular cocoa powder) but my MIL offered to bring dinner…chili….how do I kindly say no!?!? 

I just want a small short sweet get together and we are having it later in the evening. I just cant think of too many ways to present a sweet, caring way to say no to dinner and just do desserts. Mind you her last response included “whatever you want”.  I just don't know how to shut down her idea politely. (She usually makes a comment when I say no to her ideas or don't like something, ""so and so doesn't like my chili"") Help please!  


Thanks for your suggestions, I am thinking this might do the trick!

Thanks for offering to bring dinner. How about something sweet? It will be later in the evening; I was hoping to keep it simple and go with desserts and cocoa. I want to make sure everyone is together, and I think it will be nice with the fire. ",25,1765916769.0,Mildlynomil,25,1.0,False
1pock8g,https://v.redd.it/h1clun3tpl7g1,Dissolving Collagen Powder,"To head off any questions: This is completely tasteless and doesn't alter the texture or thickness of my coffee. I'm SO HAPPY because I can't stand most protein powders or health shakes for those reasons. I tasted my daughter's before committing the ~$30 to purchasing my own (Amazon), because I couldn't believe that it really was tasteless, etc.,.

 It's given my daughter more length to her hair over the last 6 months than she'd normally see in 2 years' time. Mine has been falling out (perimenopause and illness 🙄) so I'm praying this helps.

1pocj0y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pocj0y,AG GAOTU Lancero - Cigar Review,"Alex Glez, one of Cuba’s top torcedors, blends AG cigars to capture the “Cuban experience.” The GAOTU flavors of earth, wheat, nuts, and coffee were dark, but the delivery was very light. The finish on the palate was soft, and the spice levels were never aggressive. The GAOTU felt less like it was trying to replicate a Cuban flavor profile and more like a Nicaraguan puro blended for the Cuban smoker’s palate. While the flavors and construction were excellent, I would have loved to see Alex push the richness just a bit further. AG prices their lanceros at $12, which I feel is the sweet spot for boutique brands. If you prefer lighter cigars, or if you predominantly smoke Cubans, I think you’d really enjoy the GAOTU, especially if you’re looking to try something with some more oomph. Personally, I’m looking forward to trying more from AG and will keep an eye out for their upcoming releases.

# 👁‍🗨 How It Feels

Based on ingredient profiles and common nootropic effects:

✔️ **Cleaner focus** — thanks to choline support (Alpha GPC & DMAE)  
✔️ **Relaxed productivity** — Kava + Rhodiola help with calm + alertness  
✔️ **Motivation & drive** — Phenylpiracetam has stimulant-like cognitive effects  
✔️ **Memory & processing** — Uridine and Vinpocetine may help support connectivity and cerebral perfusion

*Note: individual results vary widely with nootropics and effects may be subtle or more noticeable depending on baseline focus and cognitive load.*

# 💡 Who Might Like This

🧑‍🎓 Students & writers needing sustained mental effort  
💻 Professionals requiring deep focus  
🎨 Creative thinkers during long sessions  
🧠 Anyone sensitive to caffeine who still wants cognitive support

# ⚠️ Potential Considerations

* **Not universally “proven”** — many nootropic ingredients have limited clinical evidence in healthy adults at these doses.
* **Tolerance varies** — some users react strongly to compounds like Phenylpiracetam or Kava.
* **Check interactions** with any prescription meds or medical conditions.
* **Nootropics aren’t magic** — sleep, nutrition, and training still matter more for cognitive performance.

# Bottom Line

KJ Labs Brainstorm looks like a **well-rounded stimulant-free nootropic blend** with mood, focus, and memory-supporting ingredients based on existing ingredient research. It’s worth testing if you want a smoother focus experience without caffeine.

What did piss me off is that as soon as I pull up to the window this girl with a horrible attitude rolls her eyes, and I can only imagine she was telling me to hold on, but this is how it was said. “Ho-Dawn”. Now why was I holding on? I’m glad you asked. She was telling her coworker who was talking over her (at a volume of 20,000) that she’s going to beat the snot out of some poor bastard when she gets home.

She opens up the window hands me a coffee I ordered a Diet Coke. I handed it back, she rolls her eyes and closes the window. I’m still holding the coffee. I held it until she came back with my food and a small diet. I ordered a large meal, but at that point I was so hungry and annoyed I just took my cold food and drove home.
