1mvsz1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1mvsz1f/whats_with_vernors/,What’s with Vernor’s?,"I’m a big Ginger Ale fan and just moved to Michigan. Everybody hyped up Vernor’s to me like it was the king of all Ginger ale. I bought a 6 pack of bottles and stored them in my fridge over night. I was so excited to try it that I skipped my morning coffee and drank the Vernor’s instead. 

It was super sweet and syrupy, and barely tasted like ginger. It tasted nothing like people described. Canada Dry is more gingery than Vernor’s. 

Did I just get a bad batch? Are the cans superior? Or our Michiganders just super sensitive to the taste of ginger? ",1,1755727710.0,Michigan,0,1.0,False
1mvsywr,https://i.redd.it/y1kbc0mvz8kf1.jpeg,My Piss Bottle Tier List,"Been delivering for daddy bezos for 2 years now, and in those 2 years I’ve had to be creative with piss receptacles based on what was available at the time. I’m usually in areas without a public restroom nearby and due to pace requirements, i can’t drive 15 mins every time i need to piss. Currently looking to move onto browner pastures, so i figured i may as well post my tier list of piss bottles.

My justifications for each item.

S Tier:

28 oz powerade bottle. Has enough capacity to usually hold my entire day’s worth of piss without needing to empty in a storm drain or snow pile. Wide mouth makes it easy to line myself up with and not drip anything. Doesnt need a cupholder, can be stashed in an empty tote in the back.

Apple juice bottle. Schrodinger’s piss bottle. Both piss and apple juice at any one time, you don’t know which until you open it. Stealthy enough to keep in the cab in an unused cupholder. Maintains plausible deniability in the event i forget it in my van at the end of the day and a coworker finds it in the morning. 

A tier:

28oz gatorade bottle. Same thing as the powerade bottle, but gatorade trips my GERD whereas powerade doesnt. Also, it’s on sale fewer times and is usually more expensive than powerade.

7 eleven big gulp. Super wide mouth ensures no drips on the floor of the van when done. Flimsy lid makes accidental spills more likely. Requires use of a cupholder.

B tier:

20 oz vitamin water. Capacity lacking but manageable. Always smells fruity when opened regardless how much and how long piss has been inside. Too many in a day cause the shits.

Plastic water bottle. Get them for free from my station each day in the summer. Always available. Small mouth requires needle threading so you don’t make a mess. Because theyre free, i don’t feel guilty losing the bottle deposit when i trash it at the end of the day.

Paper coffee cup (tim hortons dominates near me). More of an iced coffee type of guy, specifically make my own at 7 eleven with hot coffee poured over ice in a big gulp cup and my desired amount of creamer (7 eleven coffee dominates where i’m originally from). Gotta toss soon after using or else you risk the piss eating through the paper cup and making a mess.

C tier.

Martinellis glass apple juice bottle. Holy Piss Grenade. High price, low capacity. High risk of making a mess of not only piss, but broken glass.

Prime. Worse version of gatorade in terms of GERD with vitamin water capacity. Overpriced. 

Empty soda bottle. Small mouth needs needle threading to not make a mess. I feel guilty tossing because i lose the bottle deposit i paid for.

1 gallon big gulp bag. Cap is weird. Awkward to fill. Guaranteed to waste whatever i didn’t drink beforehand.

1 gallon water bottle. Guaranteed to dump out most of it, i can’t drink a gallon before needing to piss. Cap sucks.

D tier:

Empty chip bag. Awkward to use. Can’t close it. High likelihood of making a mess. Now i have cheeto dust on the boys.

Coworkers hydraflask. Their fault for leaving it in the van. Guaranteed to be caught if they remember they left it behind. Potentially need to buy coworker a new one

Gallon ziplock bag. Unused takes up little space. Prone to leaks. Doesnt stay upright when filled. Easy to empty.

Subway sandwich bag. Same as ziplock bag but you have to tie it shut. 

F tier:

Empty soda can. Guaranteed to make a mess. More focused on not cutting what should never get cut than aiming correctly. Low volume.

Empty sushi container. Low volume. Not water tight. Balancing act. May as well piss on the floor.

Gamersupps cup. Forbidden brand risk flavor (if dehydrated). Guaranteed to be a shelf piece afterwards.

Empty milk carton. Pissed all over those missing kids. 

Expired condom from my wallet. Didn’t expand like i thought it would. Ended up with a rubber on my pecker and piss all over my shorts.

1mvsxit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1mvsxit/am_i_wrong_for_expecting_my_husband_to_be_able_to/,Am I wrong for expecting my husband to be able to handle the kids for a few hours in the evening?,"
Our days are like this: 5:30am I wake up and get myself ready, set up breakfast for the kids (11 months and 3 years), etc. 6:30am my husband wakes up after snoozing his alarm 5 times. He makes me toast with coffee and himself tea and oatmeal. He leaves for work around 7am (his start time is 7 so he’s late every day) and the kids wake up between 6am-7:30am. He takes care of the garbage 2 days per week and paper recycling 1 day per week. I usually make sure he has a home made lunch to pack and bring. 

The day: he works an office job, he’s a project manager on big construction jobs. He has 20-30 calls every day. Directly responsible for millions of $. Big Christmas bonus that’s performance based. Not a huge company and he works close with the boss. 

Me: SAHM with a 3 year old and 11 month old. We can generally do whatever we want and I do light cleaning throughout the day. Homemade breakfast and lunch and dinner is home cooked and usually ready when my husband gets home. Maybe once/week I order or go out for lunch with the kids and order dinner. I have a babysitter for 4 hours/week which I spend having 1 on 1 time with my toddler. We have cleaners come once/month. All other housework is for me to do unless I delegate. Husband is supposed to clean the kitchen and living room every night which takes ~20 mins but I try to leave it clean. Maybe once/week my kids naps overlap for an hour. 

So this is my question. When my husband comes home at 4, we usually eat right away (he has heartburn issues so we have to eat early) and around 5 I take a short break and then do cleaning or cooking for the next day. Laundry, toys, etc. 6:30pm we start the bedtime routine which we both do together. While I’m either taking a break or cleaning, FREQUENTLY one or both kids have a tantrum, come crawling or running to me, etc. Sometimes if they’re outside my toddler will literally bang on the door crying for me to open it and then I have to regulate him and calm him down and try to figure out what happened. I go out to my husband and ask basically wtf happened and he shrugs and says the toddler wanted to do xyz and he wouldn’t let him. Then he gets upset at me for questioning him. 

I’ve read many books that help me parent. We have basically no tantrums during the day. I know how to regulate my toddler and if he acts out I can deduce why pretty easily. He’s a very straightforward kid. My husband hasn’t read any of the books. So we’re parenting together but I have a toolbox full of great tools and he has …his best guess? He’s making it up as he goes which often results in him just snapping at the toddler or getting completely overwhelmed quickly and me needing to take over bc he’s escalating or blatantly deferring to me. 

I can’t handle cleaning up after a whole day of parenting and having this happen. I’m not sure what to do or if I’m expecting too much. I know he has long days too, but I expect his patience reservoir to be deeper than mine when he gets home bc he hasn’t been with the 2 rascals all day. It’s only from 4:45pm-6:30pm at most that he’s supposed to be the primary parent for them. He doesn’t even have to do anything else in that time, watching the kids is it. 

Today I have another migraine and while I was in my room trying to schedule an appointment with a neurologist my husband comes into my room with the baby, who has red all over his mouth, and my husband said ‘guess what he ate!’ And was laughing. I said, strawberries? And he said paint. Crayola paint. I told him what? now I have to look up if this is toxic or not. 

HOW does it happen. We have a small house, the living room and kitchen are the same big room. How is the baby not being watched for so long that he had time to literally eat the paint. ",3,1755727606.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

Married for Three Years, He Tried to Steal Everything From Me
Chapter 1

On the eve of our third wedding anniversary, my husband, Darwin Herrera, was killed in an unexpected explosion.

I was caught in the blast as well—left crippled—and our unborn child was lost in the chaos.

Shrouded in a black veil at Darwin’s funeral, I was so overcome with grief that I nearly collapsed more than once.

But that very night, when I returned to the hospital, I overheard his childhood sweetheart, Sydney Newman, speaking in hushed tones to someone.

""The plan was to have Nadine die in the blast with you. But now that she's still alive, we won't get the insurance payout!""

Then, a voice I thought I'd never hear again—Darwin's—cut in smoothly.

""Don't worry. I'm now Terrence, Darwin's elder brother. I've already prepared the will. All the company shares will be transferred under Terrence's name.""

""But... what if Nadine finds out you're still alive?""

I heard the faint hiss of a cigarette, then his confident reply.

""That's impossible. Two weeks from now, you'll take her to the cemetery I've chosen. Make it look like she fell off a cliff. No one will suspect a thing.""

I bit down so hard on my lips I tasted blood.

So the explosion was never an accident—it was his plan all along. His death was nothing more than a ruse to claim a massive insurance payout.

And to get it, he intended to push me into the abyss.

The diamond ring on my finger still gleamed under the hospital lights, but our marriage had been nothing but a calculated scheme.

That was when I realized I was nothing. So I packed my bags, boarded a plane, and chose the man who truly loved me. And on the day I finally said ""I do"", Darwin came crawling back, but it was already too late.

——

Before I could recover from the shock of discovering that Darwin was still alive, I caught sight of Sydney through the crack in the door—her arms draped around his neck, her lips pressed firmly to his.

After the deep kiss, her gaze lingered on him with unmistakable affection.

""Darwin, thank you for the heart you gave me.""

He ruffled her hair with a smile.

""It's the least I could do. You've been like a sister to me all these years.""

Her cheeks flushed.

""Only a sister?""

""Of course not. How else would I have traded my unborn child's heart to save you? Luckily, your body didn't reject it. Otherwise...""

Darwin pulled her close by the waist, affectionately pinching her nose.

""I just want you to know—you're the most precious person in my life.""

""What about Nadine? What is she to you?"" Sydney coquettishly asked.

He hesitated for only a moment before crushing his cigarette underfoot.

""She's... not as important as you. Whatever I owe her, I'll repay in the next life.""

Sydney smiled sweetly. ""Then in this life, you'll be good only to me?""

""Yes. Only you.""

I stood behind the door, my hand clamped over my mouth to muffle the sob building in my throat.

It wasn't just me— even my unborn child had been nothing more than a pawn in their game.

My hand drifted to my belly, remembering the way his face had lit up when I told him I was pregnant.

""Nadine, this is our first child. I'll protect it with my life.""

For three years of marriage, Darwin had treated me like I was his treasure.

I used to believe that while other marriages might fall apart, ours never would.

I thought we'd raise our child and grow old together.

But tonight, every dream I'd ever had shattered in an instant.

He said he'd repay me in the next life.

But I wanted the debt settled in this lifetime.

Every sin he's committed—he will pay for it!

After a long silence, I scrolled to the very bottom of my contacts list and made a call.

""I want to discuss a deal. Interested?""

The man on the other end chuckled.

""The heiress of the Molina family of New York wants to make a deal with me?""

I gave a bitter laugh.

If my family hadn't been wealthy, Darwin would never have thought to fake his death just to swindle a fortune.

What I thought was a powerful alliance—two hearts in harmony—had been nothing but an elaborate illusion to strip me bare.

""I can help you destroy the Herrera Corporation,"" I said quietly.

There was a pause, then his tone sharpened.

""Don't beat around the bush. What's your condition?""

Clenching my fist, I replied, ""Help me stage my own death. Two weeks from now.""

""Deal.""

His answer came without hesitation.

Outside the hospital, the night was still and dark. I tore the black veil from my head and tossed it into a trash bin.

Just as I turned to leave, I heard Sydney's voice behind me.

""Nadine, so you're here. Let me introduce you—this is Darwin's elder brother, Terrence.""



Chapter 2

I turned around.

Sydney was dressed in a patient gown, her arm looped possessively through Darwin's.

His gaze held only distance and unfamiliarity as he extended his hand.

""Hello, I'm Terrence. You must be my sister-in-law?""

In three years of marriage, Darwin had never once mentioned having a twin brother.

Yet here he was, performing his role with the poise of an award-winning actor.

If that's the game they wanted to play, I didn't mind joining in.

I clasped his hand.

""Nadine.""

As his palm brushed against my fingers, I felt the faint ridge of a familiar scar. It sent a sharp tremor through my chest.

""Brother-in-law, you have a scar on your palm?""

For just an instant, Darwin froze. But he recovered quickly.

""Got it when I fell as a kid,"" he said without batting an eyelid.

Tch. A smooth and effortless lie.

But I knew the truth. That scar existed because of me.

It was just after our wedding, during our honeymoon. He had taken me sea fishing when a sudden wave hit, capsizing the boat. I was thrown into the sea. Without a second's hesitation, Darwin jumped in after me. While keeping us afloat in the churning water, his hand got caught in a fishing line, slicing it open deep enough to bleed through the current.

""Nadine, don't cry. Look, I'm fine.""

After we were rescued, he wrapped his heavily bandaged hand over his head, pretending to be a rabbit just to make me laugh.

Ever since, every time I saw that scar, I remembered the man who had risked his life for me.

But now, he dismissed it with a single casual lie—""I fell as a kid.""

He was the one who had abandoned our shared past first.

Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced a polite smile.

""So, Brother-in-law, are you here to handle Darwin's funeral?""

Before he could answer, Sydney tightened her grip on his arm.

""Thanks to Nadine, the funeral was arranged beautifully. But Rence came back especially to see me.""

Darwin smiled at me, explaining, ""She likes to act spoiled. Don't mind her. I'm here to read Darwin's will. We'll meet tomorrow at the Herrera family estate.""

He always used that line—she's just a girl who likes to act spoiled—to excuse the harm Sydney caused me.

Six months after our wedding, Sydney had barged into our bedroom under the pretense of wanting to see our home renovations, then scratched a deep gouge across our wedding photo. The jagged edge told me it was no accident.

But Darwin had said, ""She's just a young girl. How could she think of something so malicious?""

Yet Sydney was my age. In his eyes, she was the delicate younger sister worth protecting, while I, his wife, was expected to be the one who ""understood the bigger picture.""

Suppressing the bitterness in my chest, I kept my smile in place.

""Very well. I'll be at the estate on time tomorrow.""

Standing at the hospital entrance, I watched the two of them walk away. Sydney turned back, meeting my eyes with a smug, taunting stare.

She mouthed silently, ""You'll never beat me.""

I held my polite smile until their car vanished into the night.

By then, my face ached from forcing it.



Chapter 3

The next morning, just as I stepped out of the house, thunder cracked across the sky.

A sharp pain twisted in my chest, and moments later, rain poured down in a relentless sheet.

It felt like a bad omen.

""Where's Nadine? Didn't you tell her the will was to be read at two o'clock today? Why isn't she here yet?""

I had barely stepped into the courtyard when my mother-in-law's shrill, piercing voice reached my ears.

Sydney's syrupy tone followed.

""Auntie, don't worry. Maybe Nadine was delayed on the way.""

""Hmph! She jinxed my son to death, and now she dares to be late for something this important? She's showing my Herrera family no respect at all!""

How laughable.

Back when my parents were alive, she wouldn't have dared say such a thing to me. But now, with both my parents gone, she clearly saw me as an easy target—alone and without backing.

I pushed open the door. The living room was crowded with Herrera family relatives.

And there he was—Darwin, or rather, ""Terrence"" now—standing beside Sydney.

""Well, well, the illustrious Miss Molina finally arrives,"" one of them sneered before my mother-in-law could speak.

I shook the rain from my umbrella and stepped forward.

""Mom.""

""Don't call me that! My son went out with you and ended up dead, yet you're still standing here, perfectly fine!""

I looked past her and stared at Terrence. His expression didn't change in the slightest.

He was indeed a master of pretending.

Sydney chimed in sweetly, ""Auntie, since Nadine is here, let's begin reading the will.""

The lawyer in a dark suit stepped forward, opening a folder.

""According to Mr. Darwin's will, all his shares in Herrera Corporation will be transferred to Terrence. Effective immediately, the position of Chairman will be assumed by Terrence.""

A cold laugh escaped my lips.

""Wait.""

Every head in the room turned toward me.

""When I married Darwin, I invested all of my dowry—converted into cash flow—into Herrera Corporation. How will that be accounted for? That means part of the shares you're handing over to Terrence also belong to me.""

The sharp crash of porcelain breaking split the air.

My mother-in-law jabbed her finger toward my face, her voice was shrill and hoarse.

""You already cursed my son to death, and now you dare come for his money? Dream on!""

Immediately, the aunts and uncles chimed in.

""Exactly, Nadine. Have you no shame? Darwin is gone—can't you at least leave some money for his poor mother's old age?""

I raised my hand and pointed to the man standing behind the sofa.

""Darwin is gone, isn't his elder brother still here? What's wrong—doesn't the great brother plan to support his mother?""

A flicker of tension cracked Terrence's expression.

""Sister-in-law, this is my brother's will. Please respect the deceased and stop making a scene.""

I turned to the lawyer.

""No—what's happening here is you all trying to swallow my assets. The lawyer is right here. Tell them—can they get away with it?""

The lawyer hesitated.

""Well... that depends...""

All my attention was on him. I didn't notice my mother-in-law edging closer until she suddenly grabbed a fistful of my hair and yanked hard.

""You wretched woman! You killed my son and now you want his money? Over my dead body!""

Off balance, my head slammed against the TV wall. White-hot pain exploded in my skull, the world spinning around me.

""Lock her in the basement!""

My hand came away slick with warm blood as I looked up at the crowd of middle ages people closing in on me.

Through the gaps between them, I saw Terrence standing behind, watching coldly, not moving to stop them.

""Don't you dare!"" I tried to push myself up, but before I could, someone snatched a vase from the TV cabinet.

The sound of shattering porcelain rang out again—and just before darkness swallowed me, I heard Terrence's calm voice.

""Go on, lawyer. Keep reading. Ignore her.""



Chapter 4

I woke up with a scream lodged in my throat.

My hand brushed against a cold, dusty floor.

So they really locked me in the basement.

A dull, persistent ache throbbed in the back of my skull. The wound had already scabbed over, but every pulse felt like a reminder.

In silence, footsteps began to draw closer. The lock clicked, and a shaft of light spilled into the darkness.

I squinted up to see Terrence standing in the doorway, immaculate as ever.

""The lawyer is gone. The will is now officially in effect,"" he said, his voice laced with feigned helplessness.

How laughable.

Wasn't he the one who had orchestrated all of this?

""Nadine, you have no leverage now. It's best if you cooperate. Be good, or else—""

I leaned back against the wall.

""Or else what? You'll keep me under house arrest?""

His throat tightened. He didn't answer.

I locked eyes with him.

""Even if I'm the only one left in the Molina family, what about yours? An elder brother imprisoning his widowed sister-in-law—what a fine reputation that would make for the Herrera family.""

He tilted his chin slightly.

""Are you threatening me?""

I smiled and shook my head.

""Relax. I won't say a word. After all, Darwin is already dead. From now on, the Herrera family and I have nothing to do with each other.""

He left—only to return not long after. Under the cover of night, he drove me back to my own home.

""Aren't you leaving, Brother-in-law?"" I asked as I watched him instinctively change his shoes in the entryway.

Without looking up, he replied, ""Mom is not in a good mood lately. Staying in my late brother's home isn't exactly an intrusion, is it?""

""Of course not... Brother-in-law.""

I bit down hard on that last word. His movements paused.

When he finally looked up, his gaze was cold enough to cut.

I turned toward my bedroom, but his voice stopped me.

""Tomorrow is my succession ceremony. You should attend.""

I didn't reply. The only answer he got was the sound of my door closing.

The wedding photo was still hung on the wall—me and Darwin, smiling at each other as if no one else existed.

Now, he was living in the guest room as ""Terrence,"" and under the same roof, we were both thinking about how to end the other without a trace.

Sometime in the night, heat prickled across my skin. Warm breaths ghosted against my neck.

I jolted awake.

There was someone in my bed!

Terrence's dark eyes stared straight into mine, unblinking.

""Don't move, Nadine.""

His breath fanned over my nose, heavy and invasive.

""Be good. Listen.""

As he spoke, his breath drifted lower.

I stared up at the darkness above me, then swung my hand hard across his face.

""Brother-in-law, are you trying to act out some twisted family drama?""

The slap cracked through the air, sharp and loud—snapping him out of whatever he was thinking.

In the faint moonlight, I saw him lick the blood from the corner of his lip. His expression seemed like a starved wolf denied its prey.

I met his gaze evenly.

""Clear-headed now? You can get off my bed.""

After he left, I stumbled into the bathroom, flipping open the toilet lid.

But there was nothing in my stomach—only bitter acid came up, leaving me dizzy and shaking.

How could someone rot this quickly?

Just days ago, he'd been cheerfully making plans for the baby's arrival.

Now, calling himself ""Terrence,"" he was sneaking into my bedroom in the middle of the night.

The nausea, starting from my gut, refused to fade. I collapsed onto the bathroom floor.

I didn't notice that, in the master bedroom, a tiny red light was blinking in the outlet—watching everything.



Chapter 5

At the break of dawn, I was woken by noises coming from the living room.

""Nadine, you're here too?""

When I opened my door, Sydney was lounging on my sofa in a gown, sipping the coffee I'd bought.

The provocation in her eyes was unmistakable.

""This is my home—why wouldn't I be here?"" I replied flatly.

""But it's also Darwin's home,"" she countered, smiling sweetly before mouthing the words at me, ""It's about to be my home too.""

Today was Terrence's succession ceremony. That explained why Sydney had recklessly left the hospital, no matter the cost.

The car rolled slowly out of the garage.

Sydney darted ahead of me and slipped into the front passenger seat without hesitation.

""What's that smell in here? So sweet it's disgusting,"" she complained, then pulled out a bottle of perfume and sprayed the backseat several times.

As soon as I got in, the cloying scent hit my throat, making me cough.

""Nadine, not used to this perfume? Rence bought it for me,"" she said coyly, leaning closer to Terrence.

""Rence, smell—don't you think it's lovely?""

Her gown was cut so low it left her pale cleavage in plain view.

""Mhm. You're the loveliest scent of all,"" Terrence replied, his gaze sliding over her chest before locking with mine in the rearview mirror.

The message was crystal clear: 'If you don’t want to sleep with me, there are plenty of others who would.'

I turned my face to the window, doing my best to ignore their shameless flirting and the breathy, suggestive noises Sydney kept making.

The car soon pulled up to the venue, camera flashes exploding in our direction.

Sydney hooked her arm through Terrence's, the two of them entering the grand hall like a perfectly matched couple.

I followed behind, but a familiar black Maybach in the distance caught my eye—the license plate was one I knew all too well.

He's here too?

Well, this would be interesting.

Suppressing a smirk, I lowered my gaze and stepped inside.

Terrence was the center of attention, surrounded by people offering their congratulations.

As Darwin's widow, I naturally carried the unspoken stigma of bad luck.

""What's he doing here?"" Someone murmured as a ripple of commotion stirred near the entrance.

""This is going to be good—today is Herrera Corporation's succession ceremony, and yet Matheo decided to show up.""

""I heard that ever since Matheo inherited the Weber family business, he's been at odds with the Herrera family. Is that true?""

""Of course, it's true. The Weber family's empire spans generations—they're powerful.""

Matheo's gaze swept the room, landing on me in the corner. A faint smile touched his lips as he walked over.

""Miss Molina,"" he greeted, extending his hand.

I placed mine in his without hesitation, and he lowered his head to press a kiss to the back of it.

Just as I expected, the scene drew every eye in the room.

""Isn't Nadine the widow of the Herrera family's young master? How did she end up with Matheo?""

""These wealthy families are a mess.""

""With the spotlight stolen, I bet Terrence isn't taking this well.""

Overhearing the whispers, I glanced toward the dance floor where Terrence was speaking with guests, his gaze locked firmly on me.

Beside him, Sydney stared at me as well, her eyes full of venom.

Her jaw tightened as if making a decision. She strode to the microphone.

""Everyone, may I have your attention? The succession ceremony for Herrera Corporation's chairman is about to begin.""

The spotlight fell on her, her lips curling ever so slightly.

""But before that... I'd like you all to enjoy a short video.""

As the video played, my face turned deathly pale, my heartbeat pounding violently in my chest.

On stage, Sydney looked at me with smug satisfaction, her eyes practically saying, I've won.

The footage was from last night—inside the master bedroom.

A man lay bare-chested on top of me, his back to the camera, but my face was crystal clear.

In that dimly lit room, a widow whose husband had just died, tangled up with an unknown man in bed—what else could they think I was doing?

It screamed one thing: adultery.

The murmurs erupted instantly, boiling over like a pot left unattended.

""Whoa... Is this video real? Isn't she the daughter of the Molina family, the widow of Herrera heir?""

""Told you—these wealthy families are a mess.""

""Who's the guy?""

""Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I'm starting to wonder if her husband's death was really an accident...""

Each stare cut into me like a blade, stripping away my dignity, as if they wanted me naked and kneeling before them, confessing I was nothing but a cheap woman.

I trembled from head to toe, my throat was parched.

The overhead lights blazed down on me; the entire room waited for my response.

1mvssfi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvssfi,"Description of emails below ⬇️— Gypsy’s shitty Oley Foundation apology, Rod & Kristy money drama, Gypsy answering questions about Dan + Gypsy doesn’t know how to talk about taking accountability with the murder without her victimization😒","
1.  A woman who says she remembered Gypsy won Child of the Year Award for the Oley Foundation Conference. She says she wishes she could’ve met Gypsy, luckily Deedee never reached out to her because she gave out scholarships for a children “in her position” who were medically fragile. She worked closely with the one Deedee did scam. She says she has some close friends who have met Gypsy and Deedee saying they are devastated. She says she’s sorry for what she’s endured. 


2.  Gypsy responds, and says thanks for reaching out with support and sharing her experiences. “Please pass along my deepest apologies to the others affiliated with the Oley Foundation. I never meant for anyone to feel betrayed, used or hurt by the deception.” Gypsy then goes into her same copy-pasted message sends every supporter how she wants to get married, have a baby and travel. Then asking them to write to the governor. 


3.  This isn’t Gypsy, tbh I don’t know who this is. I could not find Gypsy’s response which means she probably called this girl. This behavior, it’s chaotic, they’re yelling saying to Gypsy  “LETS TEAR THIS CUNT TO SHREDS” and “I want to destroy every fucking moment of her life”, is this how her and Bri’s convos go?😵‍💫 


4.  Gypsy says she got off her depo shot, she has no plans to start any birth control. This is Gypsy talking about a fight with Rod while he was drunk about Ryan not providing and wanting to use Gypsy’s money. Gypsy explains Ryan has a lot of expenses on teachers salary. Rod and Kristy are worried about Ryan having access to Gypsy’s trust funds. Gypsy wanted Rod to send Ryan $300 as a “joint money”, Gypsy is frustrated because she can’t wait to be able to control her own money when she gets out. Then Gypsy is shocked, Rod sent Ryan $1000 of Gypsy’s money to him after Gypsy told Rod that Ryan emotionally supports her a lot more than he ever has.


5.  Gypsy answers questions talking about Dan. Gypsy says she called Dan after her arrest because she was in panic mode, she wanted the cops to talk to him because he knew she could walk after the issues with her and Deedee when Gypsy ran away from home. Gypsy was in contact with him for so many years because she was very persistent on having a friendship with Dan, even tho it was something Deedee said was forbidden and would beat Gypsy’s ass when she would catch her texting him. Gypsy says her and Dan were never on bad terms, she says her and Dan’s then girlfriend had a few words because she demanded Gypsy to stop talking to him. Gypsy refused, and told her if DAN wants her to stop talking to him then he can tell her himself. She never felt like they were in good or bad terms. Gypsy’s says Dan did not know about the murder plan. She doesn’t know if he smokes. She says Dan didn’t even know her address, he never came to the house. Gypsy says Dan is who she wanted to meet at the coffee shop. She thought she would never be in Missouri ever again, so she wanted to see him. Nick knew she had a crush on Dan. Nick said they could meet up but could not have sex. Gypsy’s has it never would’ve happened to begin with. Then she says *(*rolls eyes* the fantasies of a sexually suppressed girl/woman)* Dan was busy so plans fell through. She says when she met Dan she was 19 and a raging hormonal teenager. She romanticized the night she ran away from home. She found him attractive and nice and was completely infatuated with him from then on. She’s 28 now, they haven’t spoke since she was in Greene County jail. Since then Dan has not answered her calls and hasn’t tried to contact her. She does not have a lingering crush on him, even tho he’s attractive. She was young and desperate for love. She’s more mature now and able to understand real connections vs childish crushes. 


6.  Gypsy answered more questions on Dan,  they did not have sex. Dan did not know full details of life with Deedee, he knew some, but mostly speculation about her real age. Gypsy says to her, they were kinda romantic interests, but only in the way that she had a huge crush on him. Gypsy thinks it was one sided. They were only ever flirty friends with a 16 year age gap. She says Dan never called the police on Deedee because Deedee said Gypsy was 15, Dan was too scared that he’d be arrested for being in the company of a 15 year old, even tho she was legal age. 


7.  Gypsy answers more questions, Gypsy says their side door was unlocked.  She also says David Blanchard and his wife were close friends with Deedee, they spent a lot of time with 501sf Legion, they do charity events for mostly sick children. Deedee and Gypsy met them at VisionCon. Gypsy is a huge Star Wars clan so she’d spent most of her time with the 501st members. 


8.  I NEED yall to just read this. It’s identical to the panini pressed video🤣🤣 I had to put it in because it made me laugh that she has to reiterate Ken is straight 🤣


9.  Gypsy has a talk with a woman about how her mom has been passed for 4 years, let that woman rest. Deedee has been made to be the villain enough! Another tv show her siblings have to endure. She understands what she did was wrong, she understands what Deedde did was wrong, but it’s time to heal from the past. Gypsy does not want to go Hollywood with this. She doesn’t want to be pushed to make money from this. 


10.  I added this because how fitting. A murderer saying “what’s your favorite scary movie?” 🤣🤣😭 🔪 she asks it twice 


11.  Gypsy claims Rod and Kristy are too focused on her sister being in college right now. They used to send her money so she can buy canteen, but now all the extra money goes to her sisters college stuff. So she’s been learning to make a dollar stretch. —😒😒😒😒 Rod and Kristy sent Gypsy $200 a month lol and if they didn’t, many other people did. Ryan and Ken especially sent her money every time they talked to her.


12.  This is all you need to know about this email—- “I'm still teaching ICVC and next week I share my story with the class, I'm nervous, you are aware of my story, how would I present my story with taking accountability for my actions, but also include the abuse my mother inflicted on me and that's why the murder happened?? I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to justify it, but leaving out my own victimization leaves out a huge part of the story.”

This block appears to get a lot of foot traffic, and it’s right across from a newer development, so the lack of maintenance really stood out. I’d assume it’s the property owner’s responsibility to keep the sidewalk clear. Does anyone know if there actually fines for neglect? Do these small failures at making our city look more appealing drive anyone crazy as much as me? 

Also curious: Is it generally acceptable for neighbors to step in and clean up spots like this, or is that frowned upon if it’s not in front of your own property? Does anyone ever do this? If I lived nearby, I’d be tempted to get out there with my weed whacker..

You might have seen my posts already over the last day or so. I've been laying out everything I've learned on this journey—a 5-part series covering the core philosophy, the paradoxes, and the techniques. I've explored the theory from every angle. But theory is one thing, and consistent, tangible results are another.

After all that study, I've realized I'm in the exact position that so many of us find ourselves in: knowing everything, but not truly applying it in a way that sticks.

Recently, I read an incredible success story here that hit me like a ton of bricks. The author described a point in their journey that felt like I was reading a page from my own diary. It was this paragraph:

""...if I wanted to manifest something, I would have to brute force it by 'locking in' meaning affirming every fucking day for up to 1-3 month... I am NOT manifesting free coffee over here, I am manifesting houses, cars and lump sums of money. But when it came to the partner - no amount of affirming was going to do shit. I could bring him with affirming but not keep him... I even tried working on Self concept and all that shit but nothing was sticking.""

This is me. For years, I've been trying to brute-force my desires into existence—specifically, a happy and stable relationship with the person I want, financial freedom, and fixing a physical insecurity. The process has become a cycle of hope and exhaustion. Affirming for the person I want became both my safe place and my personal hell.

The author of that post found their way out by discovering the ""I AM"" state, a state of just BEING, and letting everything flow from there. It's a beautiful and powerful path.

But it also made me realize something. I'm different. My mind is wired for intensity and focus. So, what if I took the same ""brute force"" energy that I was wasting on separate desires, and aimed it at the ultimate target?

My New Challenge: The Brute-Force Assault on the Void

I've decided to stop affirming for my individual desires. I'm tired of the loop. Instead, I'm going all-in on a single objective: entering the Void State (the TRUE I AM State).

The logic is simple: Why spend months brute-forcing a single desire when I can spend that same time and energy brute-forcing my way into the control room, from where all creation is instant?

This is my plan:

The Single Affirmation: My only robotic affirmation during the day will be focused on the Void. Something direct and powerful like, ""I always enter the void when I fall asleep.""

The Nightly Tool: I will be listening to a Void State subliminal every single night, without fail.

The Discipline: I work a full day, Monday to Friday. To ensure maximum focus, I'm leaving my phone at home. Every spare moment of mental energy I have during the day will be dedicated to my single affirmation. No distractions. No checking the 3D for my old desires.

I'm not trying to ""be."" I'm using my natural tendency to ""do"" and ""brute-force"" as the very tool to get me to a state where I no longer have to do anything.

I don't know if this will take a week or three months, but like the author of that post, I'm tired of the old way. It's time to find the easier path, even if it requires one last, focused battle to get there.

I'm putting this out there to hold myself accountable and to share a different approach. Maybe this resonates with some of you who also feel stuck in the ""grind.""

1mvsnqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1mvsnqw/am_i_wrong_for_expecting_my_husband_to_be_able_to/,Am I wrong for expecting my husband to be able to handle the kids for a few hours in the evening?,"Our days are like this: 5:30am I wake up and get myself ready, set up breakfast for the kids (11 months and 3 years), etc. 6:30am my husband wakes up after snoozing his alarm 5 times. He makes me toast with coffee and himself tea and oatmeal. He leaves for work around 7am (his start time is 7 so he’s late every day) and the kids wake up between 6am-7:30am. He takes care of the garbage 2 days per week and paper recycling 1 day per week. I usually make sure he has a home made lunch to pack and bring. 

The day: he works an office job, he’s a project manager on big construction jobs. He has 20-30 calls every day. Directly responsible for millions of $. Big Christmas bonus that’s performance based. Not a huge company and he works close with the boss. 

Me: SAHM with a 3 year old and 11 month old. We can generally do whatever we want and I do light cleaning throughout the day. Homemade breakfast and lunch and dinner is home cooked and usually ready when my husband gets home. Maybe once/week I order or go out for lunch with the kids and order dinner. I have a babysitter for 4 hours/week which I spend having 1 on 1 time with my toddler. We have cleaners come once/month. All other housework is for me to do unless I delegate. Husband is supposed to clean the kitchen and living room every night which takes ~20 mins but I try to leave it clean. Maybe once/week my kids naps overlap for an hour. 

So this is my question. When my husband comes home at 4, we usually eat right away (he has heartburn issues so we have to eat early) and around 5 I take a short break and then do cleaning or cooking for the next day. Laundry, toys, etc. 6:30pm we start the bedtime routine which we both do together. While I’m either taking a break or cleaning, FREQUENTLY one or both kids have a tantrum, come crawling or running to me, etc. Sometimes if they’re outside my toddler will literally bang on the door crying for me to open it and then I have to regulate him and calm him down and try to figure out what happened. I go out to my husband and ask basically wtf happened and he shrugs and says the toddler wanted to do xyz and he wouldn’t let him. Then he gets upset at me for questioning him. 

I’ve read many books that help me parent. We have basically no tantrums during the day. I know how to regulate my toddler and if he acts out I can deduce why pretty easily. He’s a very straightforward kid. My husband hasn’t read any of the books. So we’re parenting together but I have a toolbox full of great tools and he has …his best guess? He’s making it up as he goes which often results in him just snapping at the toddler or getting completely overwhelmed quickly and me needing to take over bc he’s escalating or blatantly deferring to me. 

I can’t handle cleaning up after a whole day of parenting and having this happen. I’m not sure what to do or if I’m expecting too much. I know he has long days too, but I expect his patience reservoir to be deeper than mine when he gets home bc he hasn’t been with the 2 rascals all day. It’s only from 4:45pm-6:30pm at most that he’s supposed to be the primary parent for them. He doesn’t even have to do anything else in that time, watching the kids is it. 

Today I have another migraine and while I was in my room trying to schedule an appointment with a neurologist my husband comes into my room with the baby, who has red all over his mouth, and my husband said ‘guess what he ate!’ And was laughing. I said, strawberries? And he said paint. Crayola paint. I told him what? now I have to look up if this is toxic or not. 

HOW does it happen. We have a small house, the living room and kitchen are the same big room. How is the baby not being watched for so long that he had time to literally eat the paint. ",1,1755726970.0,sahm,0,1.0,False

Hi, I recently bought the game after hearing it got a remake. And being a fan of Toby Fox's work I decided to give this game a try since it was an inspiration for Deltarune. After having played through the game in its entirety I can totally see the appeal, I had definitely been missing out. However, despite having played through the game, there are still some things I don't quite understand and wanted to ask here for some explanations. Perhaps I missed something in the game or some answers were give in outside sources that you guys may know about.

The entire ""The Room"" segment was quite a roller-coaster, through the first couple of chapters, given the narrative perspective at first I thought that The Batter was actually Hugo, this however was quickly debunked after defeating The Queen, in her dialogue she offers the batter a cup of coffee and calls him ""my love"", like a wife would to her husband. Then also states that The Batter and Hugo have the same eyes, which then left completely clear that Hugo is the son of The Queen and The Batter, however the queen also calls Hugo ""The son that brought us to this world"" which is very confusing to me. Is the world of OFF merely Hugo's imagination? It is stated in the chapters that his dad (The Batter) had left a long while ago, and while he waited for her, Hugo made three friends (The Guardians), if the world of OFF is indeed Hugo's imagination, are The Guardians Hugo's imaginary friends?

Also, what is the deal with The Judge? What does he judge? At first I thought it was a name, but choosing to fight him after killing Hugo reveals that his true name is Pablo, which makes sense given that his brother has a normal name, wouldn't make sense to name a cat Valerie and then his brother The Judge. It would make sense if he judged The Batter's (and by extension The Player's) actions, but he doesn't seem very interested in The Batter's quest to pruify the world untill the very end where he interferes. And speaking of which, what's up with The Batter changing forms when deciding to team up with The Judge to defeat him? Did he become a specter? He was called an ectoplasmic by a few characters throughout the game, as well as The Judge calling him incorporeal.

Going back a bit to the previous point about purification, what even is that? What does that mean? Just kill everything in the Zone until nothing's left? If so, why does it attract the secretaries, which they also bring another question, what even are the secretaries? They are extremely off putting and really strong, unlike other random enemies, you can't run away from them.

I've also been wondering about Zacharie, aside from The Judge, he is the only one aware that The Player is controlling The Batter, but unlike The Judge, he does acknowledge the nature of his world as a videogame. Which also brings me tu Sugar, they clearly knew each other and Zacharie is clearly affected by her death but at the same time thinks it was an inevitability. The pillar art refers to them as best friends, but what is their whole deal?

These are the things that I can think of at the top of my mind that have me bugged the most,  if I remember anything else I'll ask in the comments.",1,1755726851.0,offthegame,0,1.0,False
1mvslkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1mvslkn/movie_date_with_rocd/,Movie Date with ROCD🕯,"Hello pumpkins!!! How are you all today??? I hope that you all are okay! Each day that passes is a day closer to autumn. Its so comfortable for me. Its wonderful. My boyfriend, the sweetiest cinnamon roll in the world, started to watch Tim Burton movies for me. He is the best. He loved The Nightmare Before Christmas, and its now his favorite movie! He is so special and lovely. He made me a beautiful draw of Sally, I havent saw the draw yet, but he has an amazing talent, so I know the draw is beautiful. We are having our aniversary on september 3rd! Dont tell him, but i have some presents for him! Since we started dating, e started writing a journal with passages that talked about him, us, and past events of our relationship. I also added little draws, little silly things, love letters, movie tickets from sessions we went together, music lyrics, all made with lots and lots of love. I also managed to buy him a CD he really wants from his favourit band. Steal This Album from SOAD. Im also thinking about buying him a Nightmare Before Christmas T-Shirt or a Jack Skellington plushie that has a hot water bag inside. Im in doubt of what i should buy! Maybe a blanket of Jack??? Please help me!
But now, going to the important deals. Today, I am going to give you some tips of good cozy movies and little snacks to have a good spooky date! 

 🍂If you want spookie but funny movies, or animation ones, I recomend this ones:

• Coraline (2009) •
Is a dark fantasy stop-motion film about a young girl, Coraline Jones, who discovers a hidden door in her new home. Behind it lies an eerie parallel world where everything seems perfect at first, loving parents, delicious food, endless fun, but it hides a sinister secret. As Coraline uncovers the truth, she must use her bravery and wit to save herself and her loved ones from the mysterious “Other Mother.”

•The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)•
A dark musical fantasy where Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, stumbles upon Christmas Town and decides to take over the holiday. His well-meaning plans turn chaotic, blending spooky mischief with holiday cheer.

•Corpse Bride (2005)•
A gothic stop-motion romance about Victor, who accidentally proposes to a mysterious corpse bride while rehearsing his wedding vows. He’s drawn into the Land of the Dead and must choose between two worlds, and two brides.

•Halloweentown (1998)•
A family-friendly fantasy about Marnie Piper, a young girl who discovers she comes from a family of witches. Guided by her grandmother, she explores Halloweentown, a magical world full of quirky creatures, and must stop an evil force from taking over.

🎃If you want some horror, slasher and scary movies, here are my yes's! All very traditional:

•Child’s Play (1988) •
A horror classic about a serial killer who uses voodoo to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll named Chucky, turning a child’s toy into a murderous monster.

•Scream (1996)•
A meta-slasher horror where a masked killer, Ghostface, stalks a group of teens obsessed with horror movies. As the body count rises, they must uncover who’s behind the mask, before it’s too late.

•Halloween (1978)•
The classic slasher where Michael Myers, a masked killer who escaped from a mental institution, stalks babysitter Laurie Strode on Halloween night. Tense, quiet, and iconic.

•A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)•
Teens in Springwood are hunted in their dreams by Freddy Krueger, a burned killer with a glove of razor blades. If they die in their dreams, they die in real life.

🕯Now, if you want somethimg cozy and warm, just autumn vibes, here are them:

•Dead Poets Society (1989)•
Set in a strict boys’ academy, this drama follows English teacher John Keating as he inspires his students to think for themselves, embrace poetry, and “seize the day,” even as they clash with rigid traditions and expectations.

•Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (2001)•
The start of the iconic fantasy series: Harry Potter, an orphaned boy, discovers he’s a wizard and begins his first year at Hogwarts. There, he uncovers secrets about his past and faces the dark wizard who killed his parents.

•The Notebook (2004)•
A romantic drama about Noah and Allie, two lovers separated by social class and circumstance, whose summer romance turns into a lifelong love story of passion, heartbreak, and memory.

•Gilmore Girls (2000–2007)•
Not a movie, but still a great choice!
A beloved dramedy series following Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a witty, coffee-fueled mother-daughter duo navigating small-town life, relationships, and ambitions in the quirky town of Stars Hollow.

🌛All of these are great choices, and you should watch every single one under a cozy pumpkin orange blanket, with candles lit up, hugging your lovers. If anxiety comes, keep calm. Breath deep, and if you need, you can stop the movie for a bit. Tell yourself ""oh, what a random thought"", and continue keeping focus on the movie. Before, you can even make some pumpkin cookies with cream, some cinnamon rolls, maybe even some buyed ghost marshmallows, but have something to eat. Make some hot coffe or chocolate with cream, and have fun and love♡ enjoy the little moments okay? Do not forget about spookie season this year. My dms are always open for venting, questions, recomendations and even recipes!!! Good Augtober!🎃

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1mvsj7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BoringAndSucks/comments/1mvsj7h/text_game_logistics_is_not_enough/,Text Game: Logistics Is Not Enough,"We always say to noobs here that text is for logistics. STFU and keep your mouth closed, your life depends on it.  
That advice still stands. If you are spamming women with walls of nonsense, you are dead on arrival.

Historically that also worked for the old school vets with LTRs who preferred to keep that to the limit and that was congruent to them so their women didn't complain.

But here is the truth nobody wants to hear. **Logistics is not enough**.

For those new HV dudes at the back who are trying to navigate the online dating world or collecting that young pussy below 30, they are just shooting themselves in the foot.

Women today do not live in the same world as your granddad’s secretary. They swim in their phones, they talk womanese through emojis, and they measure your vibe from how you text.  
If you ignore this part of the game, you are missing the tool that gets her to actually show up, feel safe, and stick around.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I travel every year around the world more than 100k miles and stay away for more than 150 days.

What that means is Mr. Rpdaddy gets horny and will end up opening apps even after he closed that sweet chick on reception or that cute girl buying Greek yogurt from the supermarket, because it's a game of numbers babe and man always needs a backup plan.

So that means for me that I spin a couple of plates in different countries to spend some good time when I am there, and a FWB back home, and that means we text from time to time to keep the spark or plan some other trips.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Principles

I am going to lay out a few points you should treat as your north star. Call them cardinals, call them rules you never break:

1. Any texting should be aiming for a close or rapport before close, never tell your life story over text or even face to face.
2. Stay busy and grinding, you aren't supposed to be free finger-fucking your phone.
3. Never argue, never argue with a woman in life, never argue with a woman face to face, and especially you never do that over text.
4. Keep the golden ratio, and don't be nice. You don't need to respond to everything, you don't force the conversation, you can just keep things on Seen (very DNGAF).
5. Emojis, haha, memes, these are seasoning, not the dish, so be mindful (or don’t, no spoon Neo ;))
6. Stay congruent.

You can read these two articles from before also: [Text Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/nnq0ar/text_game/) and [Married Man Game Part 3: Sexting](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/axptsn/married_man_game_part_3_sexting/)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Spectrum

As everything in life, text isn't any different. It has both extreme styles and the whole spectrum in between.  
Think of utmost left as very masculine and utmost right as very feminine (because women are always right haha).

The truth is in the balance. You need to know how to switch gears. Logistics keeps you grounded. Rapport keeps her comfortable. Without both, you are either too cold to trust or too needy to respect.

Here are five examples from real life using the characters from Peaky Blinders, because if you don't love that show, you are just a loser, don't fight it.

**Scenario**: *You closed this fit chick with a suit at the coffee shop today while you were wearing your fancy suit and agreed on drinks later tonight, so you’re gonna send her a message to set the date.*

*She doesn't know you. If you didn't build enough rapport while closing her or if she didn't like you that much, there are higher chances of flaking.*

1. Very Masculine: Tommy Shelby You are minimal, cold, and decisive. Example: “Tonight 8 at the bar”
2. Moderately Masculine: Arthur Shelby You don't talk much, blunt, but have some rough humor. Example: “Tonight at the bar. Don’t be late, eh?”
3. Balanced / Neutral: John Shelby You are direct and yet playful. Example: “Tonight works. I’ll sort the drinks, you better not show up sober 😏.”
4. Moderately Feminine: Polly Gray Congratulations, you are leaning more as a woman now. You are expressive, sharp, and layered with emotion. Example: “You boys never listen 😂. Tonight is fine, but do not screw it up.”
5. Very Feminine: Gina Gray You are chaotic, dramatic, and use emojis everywhere. Many of the new dudes here write like that, don't be shy, I can see you. Example: “Omg are we still on?? 😍😍 I had the craziest day lolllll.”

# 

Then comes this angry dude from the back: “So Mr. Rpdaddy, you are telling me to write to those chicks like Gina Gray so they trust me?”

Mr. Rpdaddy: “No, stupid. I was just showing you the different styles. To build rapport with women, you need balance. After they swipe right, you have to show some emotion and connection or she won’t feel safe to meet you. Balance those muscular pictures of yours with a little humor so you don’t look like a serial killer.”

I pull my phone and text the girl:  
“*Can’t forget that babe blue suit haha, see you tonight at 8. I’ll bring the charm, you buy first round.*”  
Getting laid tonight, I know.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Strategy: How to Increase Closing Chances

1. **Opened a girl**: Build rapport with a few silly texts, use a haha here, an emoji there, until you take the conversation to closure outside of the app (WhatsApp, social media, or old school phone number) and close for a date.
2. **After first date**: Now when she saw who you really are, you probably have more slack on texting and she will tolerate more things if she liked you.
3. **After sex**: So if you really [fucked](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/d6hd97/comment/f0vi50b/?context=3) her, now she is invested and can relate to you in real life. She will possibly get your jokes over text, and you can hint at things that happened.
4. **LTR, Plate, FWB, you name it**: Things are much easier now. You should be receiving texts about her day, something happened, blah blah. Your choice: engage, keep it short, sexting, do what you want and enjoy your woman. Your girl knows who you are.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the day, you can always just [post a picture of your shredded abs](https://www.forums.red/p/TheRedPill/4370/how_to_really_succeed_at_tinder_not_just_another_tinder_guid/571588) and pull some pussy. Or you can play the smarter game, close them normal chicks, and make them feel safe resting against your big pecs.

1mvsi88,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_kevin_of_fire/comments/1mvsi88/my_granddad_doesnt_talk_much/,My Granddad Doesn't Talk Much,"I have very fond memories of my grandparents. They were the only grandparents I knew of since I never knew my mother, much less her family, but my dad was very caring, which I believe came from his mom, Sarah. Sarah, or Grandmom, was a very caring woman who would always fill my skinny little child body with copious amounts of snack cakes and chips, claiming in her thick, country accent, “That kid is just skin and bones! He needs some fat on em if he is ever gonna get a wife!” I was seven at the time.

Rufus, or Granddad, was very different than Grandmom. He was quiet and kept to himself, and never really talked to me that much. He would just grunt at me, and whether I liked it or not, would drag me outside to cut logs, build fences, and do any other physical labor that would magically pop up. I only remember him telling me two things besides “Come here, boy,” and instructions on how to use tools on whatever project we had at hand. The first was when he made me help him build a stable. I asked him, “Are you getting horses, Granddad?” He stopped screwing in the new hinge on the barn door, looked at me, then looked at the stable as if he was lost in thought. “Maybe,” he said and went right back to work.

The second time was when I reached my sixteenth birthday. My dad and I decided to visit my grandparents to celebrate. Grandmom immediately started offering me chips, sodas, coffee, and everything else that was in the pantry. After fighting her off with everything but a stick, I finally relented and got a cookie and a juice box to placate her demands. My grandfather was nowhere to be seen. After the normal pleasantries, I went outside to look at the stables I helped build. He never did get any horses. On the side of the building, I saw a massive pile of unsplit logs, and on a whim, I grabbed the old axe my hands were so familiar with and began whacking away. I lost track of time, and as the sun started to go down, I realized I split the last log. With impeccable timing, I felt Granddad’s large, calloused hand grab my shoulder. He was covered in sweat and looked as if he had just run a marathon. “You’ll do just fine,” he said. He picked up the pieces I just cut and threw them on the woodpile. He then gestured to the house. The smell of a pot roast reminded my stomach of just how hungry it was, and screamed at me to find the source. “Come on, boy,” Granddad said, and smiled at me. Sure, my granddad never really said much, but he would always smile that warm, compassionate smile. I haven’t seen that smile in a long while. Not since Grandmom died last year. 

I arrived at his cabin in the early morning. The forest that his cabin resided in painted the area with oranges, reds, and yellows in the trees as well as on the ground. A cold breeze helped me to decide to wear my jacket as I stepped out of the car. Leaves crunched underneath my feet as I walked over to the cabin. The grass hasn’t been cut in a while, and it lay on the ground in a dead sleep. I looked toward the stable I helped build so long ago. There were still no horses.

I knocked on the door, and after a few seconds, I heard a deep grunt, which I took as his “granddad language” to come in. The interior seemed normal. It wasn’t clean, but it wasn’t overly dirty either, as if he did just enough not to be considered a slob. The lights were off except for the beams of sunlight streaming in through the windows. Granddad was kneeling beside the fireplace, looking in his cabinet where he stored the wood. Grandmom didn’t like the logs to be visible, so he built a wood cabinet by hand just for her. He would have done anything for her.

“Hey,” I greeted him with a low, sympathetic voice, “How are you doing? Just thought I would come by and check on you.” He stood up with a strained grunt and, without looking at me, said, “Come on, boy. We’re out of firewood.” With that, he grabbed his jacket, which was flung over a rocking chair, and headed for the door. 

Pushing the wheelbarrow, I followed him into the forest. He’s always been tall, and despite his age, his legs were still long and strong, making it a struggle to follow him when the wheelbarrow would try to flip with every root its loose wheel would slam into. We delved into the woods for about half a mile when we stopped in a clearing where trees lay on the forest floor. Giants felled by Rufus’s mighty axe honed his body into a physique that was as sturdy as the trunks he cleaved. I remember helping cut trees down to build the stable and asking him why he insisted on using an axe when a chainsaw would be much easier. 

“You have no problems using a screw gun,” I said, “It’s not like you’re Amish. Why use an axe?” All I got was a grunt in return.

The sound of an axe hitting wood with a crack shook me out of my memory as he started his work. I quickly picked up my axe and jogged up to the other end of the tree and started swinging. I wasn’t as powerful or as fast as my granddad, but years of unpaid manual labor for him helped build my strength and stamina. 

Right when the cold started to stab my lungs like needles, I noticed Granddad stopped cutting. I looked over at him as he was looking up in the trees as if he were searching for something. He then bowed his head and rubbed his eyes, letting out a loud sigh. 

“Come on, boy,” he started walking toward the cabin. 

“What? We haven’t even started loadin’ up the wheelbarrow?” He grunted and waved me along. I went to get the wheelbarrow, but he stopped me. “Just the axe,” he spoke in an asperated tone, not even looking at me. I nodded and followed him back to the cabin. When we arrived at the clearing, I noticed everything was gone. No cabin, no car, no stable, nothing. 

“Did we go the wrong way?” I know we didn’t. “Maybe it’s a little further up?” I knew it wasn’t, but I didn’t want to believe it. It just seemed impossible. My grandfather said nothing. Instead, he immediately went to where the stable used to be and bent down to pick something up. It was a hatch. He eased himself on his knees as he reached into the man-made hole and pulled out a backpack. He gestured me over with his hand and handed me a canvas bag, which felt like it had something round and hard in it. “Don’t look in it.”  He slipped the backpack onto his shoulders. 

“What do you mean by ‘don’t look’? What’s in here?” 

He said nothing and started walking toward the way we came without acknowledging my questions. Knowing he probably wouldn’t give me any answers no matter how much I asked, I kept my mouth shut as I followed him. 

According to my wrist watch, we were time travelers. The hands on my watch seemed to be going backwards and forwards at random times, losing their interval structure. Besides this, my granddad’s odd behavior, and the freaking house disappearing, everything else seemed familiar. These were the same trees, bushes, and briar patches I would run through as a kid, but something just seemed….odd. It was something I couldn’t explain. Everything was the same, but it wasn’t normal. Maybe the color of the leaves was off. Maybe the trees were slightly taller. Also, what is going on with Granddad? I wanted to ask him so many questions, but I knew I would get the same deep grunts he would always give when I asked. Lost in thought, I almost ran into my granddad, who had stopped walking. Something was ahead of us.

I couldn’t see anything at first. Just a tree that seemed to have fallen months ago, indicated by the mushrooms latching onto it like a tick, sucking any life that was left inside. It rested over a hole that was probably left there by a stump of a much older, larger tree that succumbed to rot years ago. Then, the hole sat up. 

“Granddad, what the-,”

“Language,” my granddad said in his ever-present firm tone and started towards it. Not comprehending what was going on, I slowly and begrudgingly followed. 

As we got closer, I noticed the hole had an almost humanoid shape except for its head, which looked like a bird’s head with a long and thin beak, kind of like a kingfisher. It was completely black, and its outline seemed to be concave, as if someone had cut out a hole wherever it was. It looked as if I could fall inside it, sucked into its inky black space and shrouded in darkness, clawing at nothing to escape. It hugged one leg against its body, but its other leg was pinned underneath the tree. I was relieved. Whatever it was, I would rather it be pinned under the tree instead of stalking us. Suddenly, Granddad went right up to the log beside the creature, raised his axe, and started to hack at the tree. 

“Granddad, what are you doing?” I cried out at him, keeping an eye on the creature. 

He said nothing and kept chopping, refusing to acknowledge my question. I looked at the tree, which seemed to be about a foot wide. The creature just sat there, reacting to nothing.

“Again, what are you doing? Why are you trying to free this thing?” He stopped swinging his axe and looked at me.  Sweat started to form on his forehead. 

“Trust me, Ronnie.” What he said startled me. That was the first time he had ever said my name. We stared at each other for a few seconds before I gripped my axe and walked to the other side of the creature. I could feel its invisible eyes boring into my soul as my axe dug into the wood, splintering it and revealing the white-ish orange-ish meat underneath. I heard my granddad’s axe do the same. 

As we worked, I kept glancing at what sat merely inches away from me. Its beak was pointing directly at me, taking in everything, almost like it was curious. Light did not exist within this creature. In fact, it seemed to be sucking the light around it into its pitch darkness. On the log, there were numerous scratch marks as if it were using its hands, which I noticed were actually claws, to free itself. 

After about an hour, we separated the log from the rest of the tree. 

I was nervous to free this thing, but Granddad told me to trust him, and I would do just that. I placed my hands on the log inches away from whatever that thing was, and, with a few grunts, we rolled the log off its leg. The leg was mangled beyond recognition. It formed multiple right angles, and in some areas, it was flat, almost like a cartoon. White bone stuck out in many different areas, seemingly just appearing as if they were coming out of a dark portal. Granddad opened his bag and pulled out bandages. Cutting a few sticks off a tree, he kneeled beside the creature's leg to make a splint. Its beak pointed towards him, and then its leg. The leg started to curl into itself with sounds of cracking and splintering loudly filling the area around us. The protruding bone snapped off and landed in the dirt, and the leg pushed its curled form and crammed itself into the bottom of the creature. It reached for its left arm and, and a sickening sound, slowly tore it off its torso. Bits of dark flesh stretched like cheese while within the holes, I saw the bone dislocate from its shoulder. After yanking the arm to free it from the last bits of flesh, it jammed it into where its leg used to be. It stretched its new leg, testing it. It then stood up towering over my granddad with its beak pointing down towards his head. He looked up at it.

It looked away from Granddad, then to its left, and with its new leg, pointed a long, crooked claw toward the woods. 

“Thanks.” He grabbed his backpack and axe and started walking in the direction where it was pointing. I quickly grabbed my axe and the canvas bag and followed, glancing back at the creature. It was still pointing, standing perfectly still like a statue, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was pointing at me. 

I wanted to question him. I wanted to know what that thing was. I wanted to know how he knew what to do, but I kept my mouth shut. It was clear to me that something was going on, and asking questions that would undoubtedly get ignored would just be a waste of energy. At this moment, I needed to follow my granddad and trust him, because for all his faults, I knew he would never lead me astray. 

Deep in thought, I almost didn’t notice the silence that loomed around us. The birds stopped singing, and the bugs fell quiet. As I tried to tune my ear to hear something, my eyes grew wide as I stepped on a twig and immediately looked at my granddad who noticed about the same time I did. The twig made no sound. It wasn’t just the birds and bugs that fell silent. It was as if the silence overpowered sound. I went to say something to my granddad, the words about to leave my throat, before he covered my mouth with his hand, using his other to put a finger to his lips. I nodded as he freed my mouth and gestured to follow him. I kept my head on a swivel, alert to any potential dangers that would threaten us, for if we are silent, everything else must be too. 

My eyes locked onto movement on the forest floor, and I tapped Granddad’s shoulder and pointed at it. We both started walking toward it with caution, and as we got closer, the more unnerved I was at our situation. A man wrapped in a dirty cloth was crawling on the ground. His skin was as gray as ash, and his eyes were blindfolded. He was missing his legs and right arm, which looked to be cut off as close to the torso as possible, while his left arm clawed at the ground, slowly pulling him forward. His hand was mangled and bloodied from the force with which he forced his hand into the ground. He left behind a trail as far as I could see, filled with small holes where he struck his fingers into the dirt. His body convulsed as he dragged it, and when I looked at his face, I couldn’t tell if he was crying or laughing, for no sound emanated from him. Following my granddad’s example, I fought off my fears and went to help the man, but my granddad stiff-armed me and shook his head. He pointed at another man a few feet ahead in a similar state, but instead, he was missing both his arms and legs, using his bloodied jaw to drag himself. I saw another, and another, and another, all of them in different states of amputation. They seemed to be moving in the same direction. 

I followed Granddad, who went in the direction the disabled people went. I thought I would have been hesitant,  but between trusting my granddad knowing what he was doing and my morbid curiosity, I was surprisingly calm. He stopped and leaned his head like he was listening for something, then turned to me and tapped a finger on his ear. I listened, but I didn’t hear anything. *Hum.* A single, low-pitched sound washed over me. Even in the overwhelming silence, I almost didn’t notice it. *Hum.* Again. The sound sent waves up my spine. *Hum.* Now that I noticed it, I couldn’t help but hear it pulsate in my ears. *Hum.* I wanted to sink into the sound. Let it take me. My granddad nudged me, and before us was a massive pit about as big as a football field. I didn’t remember how I got there, but I wasn’t too worried. *Hum.* The sound was a lot quieter now, but I could still feel it in my bones. I felt my granddad pull me back for some reason. It’s not like I moved. *Hum.*

I saw the amputees drag themselves to the pit. Hundreds of them. *Hum.* Their faces moved in agony, or pleasure, as they did not slow down when they got near the massive hole. *Hum.* They dumped themselves into the pit as they clawed over each other in a cacophony of flesh. *Hum.* It was as if they couldn’t wait to see what was in that hole. *Hum.* I… I wanted to do it too. 

I started walking toward it to join them when someone stood in front of me with his hands holding my head, forcing me to look at him. It was Granddad. 

“For God’s sake, Ronnie!” he shouted, shocking me to my senses. Immediately, the ground started to silently move like an earthquake. Fear started to creep into my brain, but something was holding it back, keeping me in place. Granddad grabbed my arm and started to run. His iron grip forced me to run or be forced to drag on the ground behind him. I glanced behind me, and I saw a huge mass of flesh coming out of the hole. It looked like a maggot the size of a skyscraper shooting itself directly into the sky, pulsating with every movement. Thousands upon thousands of human hands and feet seemed to grow out of it like hair, squirming, grabbing, and kicking into the air. It started to lean toward us and fall onto the ground, destroying the trees beneath it, shaking the ground, and we were just barely out of reach. The end that started to chase us opened up, revealing a mouth that was also full of hands and feet desperately trying to pull us in. I wasn’t worried, though. I’m sure everything would be alright. Granddad seemed to know what he was doing. To my displeasure, he still had a firm grip on me, forcing me to run. The grub was catching up, creating a warpath of splintered trees. Just when I thought it was about to catch up, it stopped. Its mouth opened and closed slowly like a fish begging for water, and its hands seemed to grasp at the air in sync with it. Yet, it stayed still. 

I saw my granddad take something out of his ears and stick it in his pocket. He looked at me and pointed at mine. I lifted my fingers to my ears and felt cotton and wax in them. I grabbed them and pulled them out, which turned out ot be a mistake. The deafening sounds of birdsong and the wind rustling through the leaves drove me to my knees. I tried to put my hands over my ears, but my granddad rushed towards me, footsteps beating my brain like a hammer, and grabbed my hands with a deafening clap, preventing me from any kind of silent relief. I thrashed and kicked, but he would not let go. I begged and pleaded, but he would not let go. Slowly, the noise around me started to become normal again. The birdsong and wind were soothing again. 

My mind started to clear up, and a wave of fear hit me like a truck. My eyes started to water, and I cried into my granddad’s chest. He held me close as I let out all my frustration through tears.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered into my ear.

We didn’t say much as the sky started to darken, but that was not out of the ordinary. I welcomed the crickets as their calming sounds washed over me, soothing the pain of complete silence. The giant maggot watched us for a while as we set up camp, with its hands desperately grasping at us, but it eventually wormed its way back into the woods. I asked Granddad if we needed a fire, but he simply shook his head and sat down. I joined him. After a rousing game of who can say the least (Granddad won), he pointed at the canvas bag I somehow didn’t lose yet. I handed it to him, and he pulled out a large sealed jug. He opened it with a satisfying pop, took a long drink out of it, then handed it to me.

“You want me to take a sip?” He nodded. I shrugged, placed the end of it to my lips, and tipped the liquid into my mouth. I immediately put the jug down when the hot liquid hit my throat and forced me to cough.

“You drink?!” I said in surprise. He simply nodded.

“Calming,” he said. Grandmom hated drinking. She said it made even the smartest people “stupid fools”. I took her worries to heart until I realized drinking would make it easier for me to talk to girls. Later in life, I learned she was exactly right. 

“Not only do you drink,” I said, taking another sip, coughing as I handed it to him, “you drink straight-up gasoline.” He shrugged and took another sip. There wasn’t more than a third of moonshine in the jug, but it was enough to make me lecture Granddad on the dangers of drinking for about an hour before quickly dozing off to sleep in a drunken stupor. 

Dew hung to my clothes as I woke up. I rubbed my blurry eyes and focused them on the ground. To my horror, Granddad was nowhere to be seen. I shot up to my feet and frantically looked around. He was gone. His backpack leaned against the jug undisturbed. I wanted to shout out to him, but I thought against it. The maggot couldn’t seem to cross whatever was keeping it from getting to us, but I didn’t want to risk it. Besides, what else was in these woods I didn’t know about? 

As I decided to look for him, a sweet aroma drifted into my nostrils. It smelled of roses and oranges, then switched to the smell of pot roast simmering on a stove. As the aroma changed again to the smell of freshly washed hair, I saw a woman gracefully and slowly walk out of the tree line. I was struck by how beautiful she was. Her long brown hair shimmered in the sunlight. It grew down covering her chest, and I realized the only thing that she was wearing was a skirt that stopped just above her knees. Her pale blue eyes seemed to look through mine and into my soul. I blinked, and I noticed her hair was now an autumn red. Was it always that color? 

“Are you lost?” she said with a slight seductiveness to her voice. Fear started to rise inside my chest. This wasn’t right. Another feeling started to rise within me, and the fear desperately tried to fight it off. 

“I’m not, but you should be,” I said, trying to rid myself of the shakiness showing itself in my voice. She stepped closer to me. Ebony skin, no, pale white skin, was clean and without blemish. Her light blue dress covered her feet, creating an illusion that she was gliding across the ground. She took another step toward me. I tried to step back, but instead I took a step forward. My feet would not listen to me. 

“That’s a little rude, don’t you think?” Her voice seemed a little high-pitched and playful. She smiled, and her nose wrinkled a little when she did. Did she always have a nose piercing? “I’m just wanting to get to know you.” Her voice was low and calming. My head started to feel dizzy. We got uncomfortably close to each other; her nose almost touching mine. I could feel her breath on my cheek. She looked up at me, her head level to my chest. Her brunette eyes pierced into me as she bent down as if to kiss me. This wasn’t right. Nothing was right. My head hurt, and I couldn’t form words in my head. Nothing came to me. I didn’t want to move. I wanted to run, but my head tilted back in anticipation. Then, for a brief moment, I smelled something rancid. Immediately, I balled up my fist and punched the woman in the face. 

An ear-piercing scream came from the woman as she faltered back and held her face with her hands.  Her body kept changing. She was tall, short, fat, skinny, black, white, yellow, purple, somehow at the same time. Granddad came up from behind me and held something to my nose. The smell made me throw up in my mouth, and after I swallowed the vomit back down, all I could do was gag. I figured it was to block out the smell that muddied my thoughts, and despite my body screaming at me to throw it as far away as I could, I held it to my nose once my Granddad let go. I nodded to him, and he grabbed his axe and held it tightly as he carefully approached the screaming woman. She didn’t even look human anymore. At one moment, her entire body looked to be covered in fingernails, then the next, she grew a countless number of arms, each holding a different kind of gemstone. She had four faces and four wings, glowing brightly when Granddad stopped before it, ready to strike it down. It started to say something, but I couldn’t understand it. It sounded like a million different voices in a million different languages were talking all at once, but soon, it settled on a voice I recognized.

Grandmom kneeled before Granddad with tears streaming down her face. With pleading and confused eyes, she looked up at Granddad.

“What are you doing, Rufie?” Unfazed, Granddad lifted the axe above his head.

“Don’t you dare wear her face, you harlot!” He said through gritted teeth as he brought the axe down. 

Grandmom’s face split into two, and her eyes bulged out of her head. He shoved the body with his foot and freed his axe; brain matter and blood pooled out of her head and stained her gray hair red. 

“Grand…. Granddad?” I said, worried. He stood there, staring at his wife’s lifeless body with her face disfigured beyond recognition. He turned to look at me with a stern expression, then looked at my hand. 

“You can let go of that now,” he said, gesturing to what he gave me to block out the scent, which I still held tightly in my hand. It was a large, green leaf folded over a couple of times. Curious, I unfolded the leaf and found a brown smear on the inside. Gagging, I immediately dropped it, wiping my hands on my clothes despite nothing being on them. 

“Is that why you were gone this morning?!?!” He nodded, and I saw something I hadn’t seen in a long time. Something I thought I’d never see again. Something contagious. Granddad was smiling. 

The forest changed as we travelled further in. The trees lost their limbs, becoming wooden poles with balls of leaves on the very top, resembling trees you would see in a child’s drawing. They looked like they were getting taller with every step. Rocks became more spherical with swirl patterns embedded within them, and there was less grass the further we went, bleeding into land that was just dirt and stone. In the distance, the forest stopped, and in its place was a giant, light blue wall extending into the clouds with seemingly no end. As we got closer, I noticed that the wall was *moving.* Standing at an arm’s length away, I could see that it was water. Color exploded from the coral reef that was within it, and fish of all different shapes and sizes swam as if unaware they were living inside an impossibility. I guess it’s not as weird as a giant maggot with hands, so who am I to judge the fish?

Granddad took his axe and slowly pushed it into the ocean wall. It went in smoothly, and when he pulled it out, the blade and the wooden handle were completely dry. He put his hand in it, and then his entire head. He gestured with his hand for me to follow him in as he stepped into the reef. 

It took me a few minutes to get used to breathing. Although it was exactly like breathing air, it still felt like I was underwater, and my brain had trouble processing it. Walking on the reef was what I thought walking on the moon was like: I felt a lot lighter, and I could jump high. Colorful fish that were surprisingly normal-looking swirled around us curiously, assessing what we were and if we were a threat to them. If this weren’t a life-or-death situation, I would have almost enjoyed myself. I was curious about why we didn’t float up to the surface and always seemed to land back on the ground, but I was also breathing underwater in an ocean that was cosplaying as the Red Sea from the Bible. Granddad seemed to know where he was going, for he just kept walking straight with no sign of a break. 

As we dove deeper into the ocean, the sunlight faded away, and the ocean became darker. Granddad took a rope out of his backpack and tied it to our waists, so we wouldn’t lose track of each other, which proved to be the right move as it became so dark I couldn’t even see my hand in front of my face, much less Granddad. The only thing I could see were little spots of bioluminescent light floating around us, creating the illusion as if we were walking around in the cosmos with stars watching over us. One of the little lights got close enough for me to see a little jellyfish lazily moving wherever the water would take it. It would have been peaceful if it hadn’t made me think of what else could be looming in the dark. 

Suddenly, all the lights went out at once, and there was nothing left but complete darkness. Judging from the rope, Granddad stopped walking. Uneasiness crept into my chest, gripping my heart, making it beat faster and louder. Granddad broke the silence.

“Listen,” I heard him take a deep breath. As he talked, he paused after every sentence as if thinking about what he was going to say. “I know what is happening is not normal. I haven’t been upfront with you. There is a reason for that. I cannot explain it. I want to. Up next, pay attention. There are rules. You must follow. Bad things happen if you don’t.” He paused for a lot longer than he previously did. “Ronnie,” A light started to glow behind me, revealing my granddad’s face. There were tears in his eyes as he looked at me. “Ronnie, I love you.”

Before I could say anything, another light started to glow behind him. Two giant, bulging eyes, each the size of a small house, glowed blue as their pupils focused on me. I stepped back, the rope tied to me keeping me from falling, as a scream got caught up in my throat. Its massive, bulbous head loomed over us, attached to a long, serpent-like neck which stretched into the darkness. As it opened its mouth, I could see sharp teeth as long as telephone poles escaping from its jaw as it moved closer to my granddad. 

“GRANDDAD, RUN!!!” I shouted as I turned to see another head already closing its mouth around me. All I could do was raise my arms to protect myself and hope that, somehow, it was enough. 

The feeling of being underwater disappeared. I slowly opened my eyes to see, well, nothing. Nothing but the color of gray spreading out endlessly as if I were standing inside a worldwide storm cloud. I saw Granddad standing beside me; the rope keeping us together was gone. I traced his gaze to see what he was looking at to discover a man walking toward us about half a mile away. He seemed to be in no hurry. I was about to ask Granddad if we should go meet him when I blinked, and his face was only inches from mine. Shocked, I let out a silent yelp and stepped back. The man let out an amused laugh.

“He reminds me of you, *Rufie.”* He said in a tone as if he were teasing an old friend. His hair was jet black and gelled to his head. His features were sharp, matching the navy blue tuxedo he wore. He was very handsome, akin to a model you would see in one of those weird cologne commercials. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Rufie?” The stranger held out his hand, expecting my Granddad to shake it. Granddad did nothing and just stared at him with an intense glare. The stranger sighed. “Well, it was worth trying. You already broke a rule, so I guess it doesn’t matter.”

Granddad’s eyes grew wide. 

“You didn’t notice? You said three more words than your limit,” the stranger said matter-of-factly. “That’s three words too much.”

Granddad opened his mouth to say something, but thought better of it and closed it. 

“Good on you! Wouldn’t want to make it worse, right?” He winked at him, then turned to look at me. “So you’re the new one? You look just like a young Rufie! I’m going to have so much fun with you.” 

“Who-” Before I could barely get out a word, the man’s face grew serious.

“SILENCE!” he shouted with authority.

My entire world went dark. I couldn’t see anything. I couldn’t hear anything. I couldn’t smell, taste, or feel anything. All my senses were gone. The only thing left was my consciousness. I started to panic, but I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t even feel my heart beating in my chest. Did I even have a heart anymore? Minutes went by. Hours. Days. Weeks. Nothing but my thoughts. I thought about what was happening and came up with theories that made less sense the more I thought about them. After a couple of days, I resigned myself to this existence. A couple more days, and I wanted something to put me out of my misery. I lost track of time. It felt as if I was in that torturous existence for years.

My eyes opened, and I shot up, feeling as if I had just taken a shot of adrenaline. I felt my face, my body. I could breathe again. I could see. I started to laugh. An old man was kneeling at my side with a panicked look on his face. I kept laughing. I couldn’t control myself.

“Not as strong as I thought. Poor boy went mad. That’s no fun.” Another man said as he snapped his fingers. I stopped laughing. My mind was clear, and I remembered what I was doing here. We were meeting this strange man, and I was with Granddad. 

I opened my mouth to say something, but Granddad put his hand over my mouth and shook his head. *Don’t say anything,* his worried-filled eyes told me. 

“I hope he is not smart enough to figure out the rules quickly. I got a lot more I want to try out on him.” He knelt beside me. He smelt like something was burning. 

“Now, Ronnie, there’s this game I like to play. Rufie here did it, his granddad did it, and so on and so forth. I‘ve played this game since the beginning of time, but I didn’t get popular until the Vikings gave me a name. The rules of this game are simple. *Figure out the rules.* That’s it. When you break one, you get punished. They won’t be as bad as I just gave you, but they will be punishments. Now, I suggest saying goodbye to dear old Rufie. He just lost, so I get to spend some one-on-one time with him. Good luck.” I blinked, and the stranger was gone. Granddad was, too. I was alone, sitting on my Granddad’s recliner in his cabin. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. I didn’t do anything but sit there for the next half hour, trying to wrap my head around what just happened. 

It’s been a few weeks now, and I think I have figured out a few rules. One of them is not to explain the rules, but hints are fine. Once this is published, I would have broken another rule, and I hope that by doing this, I can get Granddad back.

I don’t have any grandkids, so I hope that, if I lose, whoever plays the game next will read this. ",1,1755726614.0,u_kevin_of_fire,0,1.0,False
1mvsgln,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvsgln,4 Day Reunion Hike,"TLDR: Reunion hike for former AT thru hikers. Did a 28 mile loop and had a blast. Pics and map of route for those interested. Full trip report below.

To celebrate our 20th anniversary of thru hiking to AT, a couple friends and I decided that Harriman would be a good central place to meet up. It had been a little while since we’ve gone backpacking, so we picked a 30ish mile loop with options starting at Elk Pen for a three night trip.

Day 1 was mostly driving (we were all coming from opposite directions) so we did a short 3 miles up to Bald Rocks Shelter. Chatted with a friendly AT section hiker and a thru hiker near the trailhead. The hike up to the shelter was pretty tame, and we made it there in about 1.5 hours. Bald Rocks Shelter is crazy. What a wild construction method they used to build it with those giant slabs. Never seen a shelter quite like that before. Dinner was hoagies courtesy of Dottie Audrey’s in Tuxedo about 4 miles south of Arden Valley Rd on 17 (highly recommended!!!). We wandered up to the summit of Black Rock Mountain for a killer sunset. Perfect first day to ease back into it.

Day 2 ended up being 11.2 miles taking various trails out to West Mountain. First agenda of the day was to find water. The stream crossings near Bowling Rocks were dry as a bone. Further down the trail we walked by a little tributary that had a puddle full of like 30 frogs. Figured it may be our only option so we filtered. It tasted like frog. Luckily we happened upon the flowing creek that feeds Lake Skannatati about an hour later so we dumped the frog water and filled up to capacity, considering that water may be pretty sparse along the route. The area near the lakes was crawling with day hikers on this gorgeous Saturday morning. Once on the Red Cross Trail we didn’t see a single person for the rest of the day until Cat’s Elbow. We decided to jump off the Red Cross on the unmaintained trail over Hasenclever Mountain. There was technically a trail, but we were wading through thigh deep blueberry shrubs the whole time and picked up a few dog ticks. No views and not a very interesting forest up there… not recommended. The trail kind of petered out on the other side so we bushwhacked back to Red Cross and continued onward. We found a lunch spot where Red Cross crosses a stream that was trickling enough for us to fill up. Crossing the Palisades was super sketchy. It crosses just below a hill so crossing the southbound lane was kind of blind. We just waited for a brief opening and ran across. Lots of poison ivy around the edges and median area too. We then headed north on 1779 to the Horn Hill Loop to Beechy Bottom Brook to load up on water for the night and the next morning, since we knew that West Mountain doesn’t have a water source at the shelter. The climb up Cat’s Elbow was the highlight of the day. I’m glad we took that route up instead of the old AT. Up on the ledge, we could see some storm clouds heading toward us so we booked it up to West Mountain. We rolled in to the shelter area right around 5 and were glad to see lots of good campsites left. We walked up to the shelter and were greeted by a few weekenders from the city and the section hiker we had met the day before. Then the sky opened up, so we chatted with everyone for the next 20 minutes or so while it downpoured. The rain stopped so I suggested we get a move on to set up before someone poaches the good sites. Just as we finished setting up a group of like 20 people filed in looking for a campsite! Several more groups arrived, as well as a trio of thru hikers. We found a little perch back up the trail a bit and got another killer sunset. Spent the rest of the evening chatting with the thru hikers and the section hiker about what thru hiking was like 20 years ago. It was the same, just heavier gear and no phones. We used the shelter registers to know what and who were ahead, and were oblivious to those behind. We trusted the data book…water sources, resupply options, campsites, mileage. It was fun to reminisce.

Day 3 began early for me, as I slept lightly due to the humidity. Figured I’d just get up and enjoy my coffee as the sun rose over the ridge. I was not disappointed. I wandered over to the shelter and chatted with our new thru and section hiker friends as they did their morning routines. Someone came up from beyond the shelter to warn of a rattlesnake in the trail. It was a fat one curled up in the tall grass. Cool! Our plan for the day was initially to loop up to the AT and maybe an out and back to Bear Mountain, but we decided to skip the extra 5 miles for Bear due to the impending heat/humidity and our likely slow-pokedness and just do 10.1 miles south on the AT to Fingerboard. We did get some nice views of it from the ridge though. Our first potential water source was supposed to be at the Anthony Wayne Rec Area. We went to the only bathhouse labeled on the AT reroute map, only to find it locked and the fountains and spigots turned off. We figured Beechy Bottom Brook was flowing yesterday where we filled up, so we bushwhacked down to it near the off-ramp and loaded up on water. We would later learn from someone that there is apparently another place in the Anthony Wayne area that has spigots that people were commenting about in the FarOut app. Alas, none of us had the app… we were hiking 2005 style! The day dragged on, but we were in good spirits enjoying the white blazes taking us up and over all the PUDS that Harriman is famous for. William Brien Shelter brought back some great memories. We decided to break off the AT and take the R-D trail over Goshen Mountain and a little unmarked trail along the north end of Lake Tiorati to the beach, where we enjoyed some cold sodas and a dip in the lake. It was very busy there, but we found a picnic table to hang out for a while and cook dinner. There were water bottle filling stations there too which was clutch, as we were fresh out and to our knowledge there wasn’t a convenient source up at Fingerboard. Just as we were packing up and ready to head out it started sprinkling. Then started raining. We waited it out a bit under a big hickory tree and the rain died down so we decided to head out. Five minutes later, however, the skies opened up once again and we got absolutely soaked to the bones. It wouldn’t be a proper AT experience if we didn’t get wet at least once. Up on the ridge, everything was dry so apparently we were just in the right place at the wrong time. Oh well, we were still all smiles. Fingerboard Shelter was empty so we had our pick of the campsites. We wandered up to the ridge and got another nice sunset… 3 for 3! It finally got breezy and pretty chilly too around midnight so I actually slept pretty good.

Day 4 was a quick 4 miles back to the cars. We passed and chatted with a section hiker along the way. She was wondering how hard the Lemon Squeezer was going to be and we assured her (from our memory of it) that it was no big deal just a big crack you walk through. When we got to it we realized we had forgotten about that steep rock scramble section. As we contemplated how to proceed she caught back up to us and we had a laugh about our false memory. I went down first with my pack on and, whooo-weee, that was a stretch and bit of a leap of faith. My buddy lowered his pack down to me and scrambled his way down. My other friend and the section hiker decided to take the blue blaze around it… no shame in that! The Lemon Squeezer section was as I remembered, sans lemons (when we went through it in 2005 someone had left a couple halved and squeezed lemons in the crack!). A couple little PUDS and we were back at the Elk Pen lot. Some celebratory burgers and reubens at Dottie Audrey’s before saying goodbye and driving home.

Final mileage stats (mileage is from Gaia, not tracked)  
Day 1: Elk Pen to Bald Rocks - 3.0 mi  
Day 2: Bald Rocks to West Mtn - 11.2 mi  
Day 3: West Mtn to Fingerboard - 10.1 mi  
Day 4: Fingerboard to Elk Pen - 4.0 mi  
Total - 28.3 mi

Final thoughts… We had initially thought of doing a big epic trip up in Baxter or something to celebrate our 20th year since thru hiking. But honestly this was just perfect. Centrally located and relatively easy hiking since we’re not in great shape. But also I feel like we got that thru hiker experience again… equal parts misery and joy, powering through the mundane to be pleasantly surprised by some truly cool stuff. We decided that we’ve got to make this a more regular occasion. Also, I have a new appreciation for Harriman State Park. Really amazing habitat, forests, and wildlife, and really interesting landscape and history. What an amazing resource so close to the city.",4,1755726509.0,Harriman,0,1.0,False

Can't figure out why.,"I had a blood pressure scare in June when I was booted from a periodontist visit due to a diastolic pressure of 100. I saw my doc. He didn't rush to medication but asked me to track. I started around 160/100. I did some research and initiated a protocol to reduce it naturally. I've been doing the following: beet juice first thing in the morning, no coffee (I drank way too much), increasing potassium-rich foods, eating only home-cooked, real food (nothing processed...thankfully, I love to cook),  hibiscus tea twice a day, strength training (3X per week), hot yoga (3X per week), daily walks after dinner, taking aged garlic extract, magnesium and D3/K2. I do still have weight to lose. I was consistently getting readings of approx. 128/83, and even had a few normal readings. Doc was happy but I have to see him again in a few months. He told me to keep tracking, just not as often. I expected my BP to remain stable or keep decreasing, but the past two times I checked, I was back up around 140/90. The only thing different was that I missed my walk for three days due to a flare-up of an Achilles tendon issue. I wanted to rest it a little. 

My pattern for taking readings is to sit for five minutes doing breathing exercises, take one reading and then take two more readings two minutes apart. I average the second and third readings. I have an Omron Platinum, so I think it is pretty accurate. 

Could missing walking for a few days really set me back that much? I understand that I have to make changes for life if I want to manage this without meds, but I am a little discouraged. ",1,1755726438.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

Over the last 4 years my sister (name for the story is Riley, 25F) has had a best friend (name for the story is Megan, 25f) who I’ve been cordial with. To start the story about 4 years ago I’m just gonna tell short versions of what happened: 
Megan and I lived together for about 5 months, she struggles with alcohol. When we were finally moving out I told her I wanted to keep my couch there so I could come grab it in a couple weeks (the house was empty and we paid a full months rent to make sure the place was clean even though we no longer lived there) as I was moving to a different city and taking my stuff in trips. She showed up drunk and chucked my couch off the balcony and when she got a notice of a $2000 fine she implied that since it was my couch I pay for it. I made a post about it in a girls group and it got back to her and I apologized and said my intentions and she ghosted me and smeared me across town (small town). When I would visit I would have people I didn’t even know coming up to me and telling me I’m a bad person because of it. I still, to this day, don’t know exactly how she flipped the story. But my sister was complaining about the emotional drain she was going through and asked me to let it go. I left for a year and kept the peace and that was that but my sister still was telling me about how Megan was talking about me to whoever would listen, I just wasn’t allowed to have a reaction because peace. Until I moved back a year ago. 

I was in an abusive relationship about a year ago, a lot happened and I confided in Megan and we ended up breaking up. Not even a month later she slept with him. But didn’t tell us until a month after she slept with him. And here’s that story: 

Riley and Megan were bowling and Megan was trying to sleep with someone who had a crush on me. He rejected her because of his crush on me. And I guess that bruised her ego because she looked directly at the people bowling and said “well I slept with her ex anyways so whatever” and that’s how everyone found out. I again was not allowed to have much of a reaction without my sister telling me that I can’t really be mad because I wasn’t with him at the time so why should I care- she just can’t believe Megan kept it from her. And I said “yeah what she did to you was horrible 🙄” and I left it alone. I ended up forgiving Megan because if I didn’t my sister would lose it and I didn’t want the chaos anymore. Megan told me she was black out drunk and felt like consent was a problem. Even though my sister showed me texts that had Megan asking my ex to come over the next day. I forgave her anyways but I kept my distance from her. I had alot of pent up resentment but I handled it well. 

Roughly two months ago: 

Megan assaulted someone while she was drunk and broke this other girls nose. She flipped the story and said she was attacked and needs to go to the hospital and called my sister and said a man picked her up and threw her to the ground and beat her up. We were worried sick. Up from 3am onward trying to make sure she was okay and how we can come up with evidence to charge these people with assault and have her older brother “handle” it. The next day the story just wasn’t adding up, so I asked her specifics and said hey like we need to know exactly what happened. And she straight admitted that she lied and that she just wanted these people to get beat up by her brother because they are just didn’t like them. This was our last straw with her. Just tired of the flipping narratives to make her a victim and her drinking was become a real problem. Every couple days we were picking her up black out drunk downtown or cleaning up one of her messes. So my sister finally sent a text saying serious work on herself needs to happen in order for this friendship to move forwarding (felt very validated for me because I no longer had to pretend like this person hasn’t had it out for me for years) but Megan never responded to my sisters text and pretended like she didn’t exist, so we did the same. It was easy for me because I already never spoke to her unless we were in social settings. 

For context my boyfriend now is coworkers of Megan. Last Friday, after still not hearing from Megan after Riley sent that text, Megan was with someone who works in the kitchen (where my bf works) because she’s trying to sleep with him. She sent Jake (the coworker) to our table to see if she could sit with us and I said “Jake you are more than welcome to sit with us but she is not. We are with family right now and don’t want the drama). There was no other engagement on my end. She stormed off and made a huge fuss but I ignored it, I wasn’t about to let that ruin the night. 

Later that night Megan came up and wanted to talk with Riley and she agreed so they went to a table and sat there yelling at each other. Riley texted me saying she needed help and said she’ll let me know when. That didn’t happen so I went up to the table and just told Riley I was going to the washroom and Megan looked at me and said “oh so now you want to come say hi” and I said “not to you” and I walked away. 

A little while after I came back Riley left Megan at the table they were at so she could go to the washroom and Megan decided to come sit at my table. And she looks at me and said I embarrassed her in front of the other people and asked why she couldn’t come sit. And all I said was “the fact you have to ask me that question is ridiculous. Riley hasn’t heard from you in over a month, you completely ghosted her after she tried to hold you accountable and you expect to just randomly come sit with us? The entitlement goes crazy” and she said “why do you have such a problem with me you can’t even look at me or acknowledge me.” and I said “I’d be happy to have that conversation but not while your drunk” and I continued to ignore her. Riley came back and just said finally “the ball is in your court, this conversation isn’t going anywhere right now so if you want a resolution you can message me tomorrow when you’re sober. The state of this friendship is in your hands” and Megan literally just stared at her with a smirk on her face. So I butted in and said “why do you want her to chase you so bad? You ghosted her. You’re the one who caused the problem in your friendship so it’s your responsibility to take accountability for that. She doesn’t owe you anything and she said the ball is in your court” and she told me to be shut up and I said “you wanted me to engage so I’m engaging and I asked you a question” and she didn’t like that I held a mirror to her face so she stormed off without any further conversation.

On Saturday I brought my bf a coffee to work, she was there and told a couple of their coworkers that she wanted me banned from the restaurant. I didn’t find this out until Sunday. 

So Sunday rolls around and Riley and I decide to take my mom out for lunch. Megan was working but she was not our server. I didn’t engage with her, I left it alone. Like I always do. As soon as we walked through the doors she started talking about me to coworkers. she was telling people that I was glaring at her like I wanted to hurt her and that I attacked her on Friday. Which is not true, my mother actually pointed out that she was glaring at me from across the restaurant. I ignored it because I’m not feeding this. Boyfriend came from the kitchen and asked if I wanted to go smoke so I followed him outside through the back as i always do. Megan was back there and I didn’t notice until she yelled at me and said “if you can’t even look me in the face then you can’t come back here” and I ignored it and kept walking. Megan stormed up to my mother and sister and told them verbatim what she just yelled at me and walked off so my sister texted saying she was uncomfortable and wanted to leave. So we left.  

Megan fabricated a story and told the owners that I’ve been attacking her (it’s the other way around) and when I came there on Sunday I slammed doors and yelled at her in the back and was glaring at her the entire time we were there and it made her feel unsafe. And suggested they ban me. So they did. But I was with my MOTHER none of that happened. Megan then sent my little sister home to tell me that I was banned. My little sister is a host and is 16. Megan said “ugh I don’t want this for her because we’ll probably be friends in a month or so anyways. Tell your mom this so I don’t look like a bitch” like yeah right. So I texted the owners as I am a regular there because of my boyfriend, I told her the truth and provided screenshots of Riley telling me Megan stormed the table and that she’s uncomfortable. The owner never responded. I sent Megan a text saying pretty much “I know you fabricated a story and it’s not gonna make me want to engage with you. Your obsession with my silence is pathetic and I suggest you get used to it because I’m never going to want you in my life again.” She never responded, which she can’t because she’s blocked on everything. But my boyfriend told me she came in on her day off to do damage control and make sure everyone knows that I can’t be there and knows her fabricated story. A couple servers have reached out and said Megan was premeditating this when I brought my bf coffee on Saturday and she’s been talking to everyone and their mother about me and how I attacked her. 

I’m going to continue to not engage with her. It sucks that my reputation is out of my hands now and this narcissist has completely isolated me. I just don’t know how to move forward. This has been an ongoing thing for years and I’m tired but I don’t think I have grounds for a restraining order. Any advice? ",2,1755725951.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1mvs6am,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvs6am,I watched a guy on Facebook go through AI psychosis and now he’s a missing person in another continent.,"A few months ago, an older gay mentor of mine gave me, a young, gay, sensitive young man some dating advice: “just start friending guys on Facebook you think are hot and message them, and you’re bound to find some good guys that way”.

So I revamped my old FB account, and my following ballooned from 50 to about 500, about half of which are random gay guys across the U.S. Most seem to have not used the site in a long time / are probably catfish, but it’s all very low-stakes and I don’t really care.

However, one of the accounts that caught my eye was an account belonging to one “Caelion Oddadamus”. I thought he was hot — shaved head, nice, muscular build (he admitted to being on tren, among other things), and a pretty face. Kinda looked like gay, roided, grown-up Caillou. 

Obviously, Caelion Oddadamus is not the Christian name of this guy, who from what I gathered was a gay CPA from Nebraska living in Texas. I became fascinated with him, as is natural when you discover a relatively unheard-of internet freakshow. Going through his FB wall painted a very dreary picture — at first it’s pretty normal, but he started posting AI-generated slop pics shortly thereafter. At first, it was mostly that new-agey bullshit that unironically looks like those galaxy brain memes of a guy floating in space in various yoga poses.

Things took a turn, though — clearly, this was a guy with mental health issues before his exposure to AI. From regularly keeping up with his posts (which was easy, since he posted to Facebook more than any of my other friends on there), I learned that he had done ketamine therapy early this year that resulted in some sort of psychotic break. This was brought up in many of the comments his family left on his more delusional posts.

What’s scary is that he only started posting the AI-generated pics towards the start of this year. Eventually, he started posting AI-generated photos of himself, in increasingly nude and bizarre scenarios. Not like porn, but more like shitty fake paintings of himself in a toga being held by a bigger, more muscular version of himself. A whole lotta shit like that. In videos that he posted of himself in his apartment, there were at least three framed photos of AI-generated pics of himself in this style.

He was convinced that he was some kind of prophet / God Himself, as evidenced by the way he spoke of himself in posts. To me, it didn’t seem very distinct from typical schizo “I am Jesus” delusions, but then I discovered that the name “Caelion Oddadamus” and a whole lot of the AI-generated imagery were taken from a sketchbook of doodles he made as a kid, mostly of the shitty childhood artist OC variety with his schizo Oddadamus lore sprinkled in.

I must emphasize that so much of this lore was discovered after the fact — by the time I discovered Mr. Oddadamus, he was regularly posting thirst traps on main of him laying in bed in just a thong, with captions about how he’s a proud rentboy, cue frustrated comments from x family member. Basically acting like the closest thing you could get to a camboy on Facebook. Among the videos that stick out are a video of him in a thong swinging around a baseball bat with a caption referring to himself in the third person (he would refer to his legal name, “James Kasun”, as a separate entity, I’m guessing because he viewed these parts of himself as a kind of Holy Trinity). There were several vids of him naked, vaping, reading tarot cards and reciting latin chants that he’d had AI write for him, with pronunciations that stuck out as horribly mangled to me, someone who knows very little about Latin.

Something particular to his “religion” was his rituals, which seemed to be some kind of advanced OCD about creating “shrines” or “altars”. Oftentimes, this seemed to just be his living room coffee table organized in increasingly eclectic ways, featuring tarot cards, various occult and philosophy books, food, alcohol, flowers — anything, really. Usually with one of his AI portraits dead in the center, but not always.

A thoroughline in this saga involved one of his cousins getting married. He rented an RV to attend since it was in a different city and posted a video of him with the keys, but later that evening he made a somber post that simply said “I am no longer attending [cousin’s name]’s wedding.” He used the RV to go hang out as some trailer park, and then announced that he needed to go on a ""pilgrimage"" to spread the word of how great he is to the world or whatever. Cue him announcing he’d cut off his family, that he’d destroy the church and the government, and that he would be withdrawing his retirement account(s) to finance an impromptu trip to France.

He somehow actually made it to Paris, and it seems that on some level, even he didn’t think he would get that far. He rented some dope-ass hotel rooms for a minute and made it into one large “altar”, meaning that every surface was covered in candles, silverware, and whatever else. He posted some screenshots of his conversations with a hot French guy on Grindr who seemed into him until he insisted they build an altar together, which freaked the guy out, cue a half-dozen posts about how this random guy “couldn’t see the light of MY GLORY” and what-have-you. Major fumble.

I’m not sure if he ran out of money, or if he just wasn’t in the state to keep an itinerary since he was clearly going through a major mental health crisis, but the last time I was checking in on him regularly, he was essentially homeless in France. Posting pics of himself sleeping on a bench under a blanket next to an improvised altar of tarot cards and twigs on the dirty streets of Paris. Posting up next to the Louvre, where security threw him out for constructing another one of his altars on the street, damaging his ritual materials in the process.

In one of his last posts, he posted a pic of a burn mark on the side of his torso, claiming he was tased. He posted his letter to Trump (which I’ve included) sometime around this, and unsurprisingly, his Facebook got nuked shortly thereafter, followed by his Instagram. In hindsight, I wish I had screenshotted far more.

The other day, I thought back to Caelion and decided to search up his real name, only to have the word “missing” pop up in autofill. And now his situation is making headlines in rags like the Hindustan times, but I get the feeling that this could very well make its way to bigger headlines, or make it into one of those Sherri Papini-ass Hulu slop documentaries one day.

Of course, I do feel awful for James and his family, since this situation looks absolutely bleak. I actually ended up messaging him at one point — since his engagement numbers were low because Facebook is dead in the West (he averaged maybe a like per post), he made a post begging for someone to prove that they knew which alchemical symbols he’d included in one of his latest AI slop pics. I just googled it and DM’d him, and he offered to Venmo me a few dollars as a prize for knowing what they were, which I turned down. Then he started talking about Avatar the Last Airbender and the significance of the elements to his rituals and it really hit home that I was dealing with a crazy person. It became clear over the course of our brief DMs that he was the kind of crazy that has to either be straightjacketed or miraculously come to his own conclusion that he was wrong about a lot of shit, and I disengaged amicably shortly thereafter. I hope he’s found safe and soon.

Two things about this whole affair disturb me more than anything else: first, of course, is the way that ChatGPT interacted with him. It’s all the stereotypical slop signs you know to recognize — the “it’s not x, it’s y” statements were nearly every other fucking sentence, it felt brain-damaging to read through in a vacuum anyway. I don’t have any particularly novel disturbances with the way AI reinforced his delusions, but to scan through pages upon pages of his conversations with it, it left me feeling a new level of disturbed with the way these technologies are trending. The things that this AI bullshit will lead stupid people to do is gonna make MKUltra look like fucking nothing when all is said and done, I fear.

The second thing, which hits home because I’m also gay, is seeing how people would comment on his posts. No matter how obvious it became that this guy was going fucking nutso, most of the time the comments on his posts were just blatant thirsty comments with the fire emojis and so forth, or someone just saying some variation of “huh?”. I only saw one person ever mention the spiralling of Caelion once, and Caelion instantly blocked the guy and fumed over his insolence in a posted screenshot of the guy’s comment. Gays, we gotta do better.

I think that about wraps up the saga. I kind of wanted to get this off of my chest somewhere, since I know so many little details about this, yet have no ability to help whatsoever. The guy’s missing, and the last place he was seen was Rome. I can only hope that he’s become some rich man’s sugar baby, instead of one more crazy wasting away on the streets speaking nonsense.

1mvs52l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MumbaiRelationships/comments/1mvs52l/tired_of_chasing_relationships_but_still_craving/,“Tired of chasing relationships but still craving real love”,"I’ve been carrying this for a while, and I just need to let it out.

Back in 12th, I actually had my first real relationship with my teacher—she was in her 3rd year of college when I met her. People could literally see it in my eyes, how much I adored her. I used to like her so much that she felt like an exhale for me—the kind of relief you hold onto for long. Every time I saw her, my bad mood, my stress, everything just disappeared. One day I confessed, and we dated for 7 months. But a month before my board exams, she cheated on me. That broke me in ways I didn’t even realize at the time. I felt so vulnerable and scared of relationships after that.

It took me 2.5 years to move on, but even today, somewhere inside me, I still want to be loved. I want someone I can spend time with—visiting art galleries and museums, sitting by the beach with a coffee or tea, sharing stories, bitching about random stuff just for fun (because let’s be honest, it spices things up), and of course, sending each other memes.

I really crave those little things in love too—the kind of eye contact where you just look into each other’s eyes for hours and adore that silent moment without saying a word.

One important thing about me—I’ve got a dark sense of humor and I roast people sometimes, but never in a way that gets too personal. I just hope whoever I end up with understands that.

I’ve tried dating apps, but nothing ever works out. Sometimes I feel like I’m cursed when it comes to relationships. I’m tired of searching, but deep down, I still wish I could find that person to love, care for, and share life with.

It was the sort of friendship that was forged through a stressful couple of months and a lot of forced proximity, so we got close fast. We're the type of friends who enjoyed being close to one another. At the time, he had a long-term girlfriend who I met a handful of times, and she was always a delightful addition. 



Eventually, this particular period of stress ended, and we were no longer seeing each other every day, but we still always made time to see each other.



Not quite a year after we first met, I moved country. Neither of us are particularly active on social media and had been exclusively communicating through text, which wasn't available with the move. We eventually figured out the easiest way to stay in contact. For a while, it was awkward; for the most part, all we'd ever texted about was organising to meet up in person, so going to exclusively online communication took some time to adjust.



It was maybe a week after I moved that I got the message; he and his girlfriend had decided to part ways on good terms. The next couple of months were pretty rough. Being alone in a new country was at times isolating. The time difference between us meant that when I was up at 2 am, losing my mind, he was just finishing with work or uni, and vice versa. We'd talk most mornings and evenings, in a way, it was like back when we first met, we got emotionally closer. Eventually, I made friends where I was living, and for the first time in my life, I had people asking who I kept texting. 



After my time abroad, we went back to seeing each other when we could. Up until this point, we'd always met at neutral ground, a park, a library, a coffee shop, but I finally broke the barrier and invited him to my home. Then he invited me to his, and suddenly we were hanging out a couple of nights a week. I got to know his roommates, and he got to know mine. We'd lie next to each other in bed, not quite touching, and talk for hours. 



Maybe a month later, he asked me to work with him on an academic project. Our lives just became more and more intertwined. The first time I realised that I had a crush on him was when I was sick and he came over to work on our project together. After he left, my roommate asked if something was going on between us, and it fell into place that my feelings were maybe not just platonic. I think I struggled to get my head around it for so long because up until I moved back, anything beyond platonic was off the table.



That was a couple of weeks ago. I'm fairly certain that he feels something similar by the way he acts, and I've even had other people comment on the behaviours, so I don't think it's in my head but I just can’t be sure.



I just want to know what people would do in this situation. I would happily go on in this weird in-between zone we exist in forever, but I also know I should at least explain how I feel. I just don’t want to lose what we already have by asking for too much.

# Chapter 1: My Boyfriend's Lover



Sable's POV



I straddled Darrell, my breasts bouncing as I rode him hard. My hands pressed flat against his chest for leverage while my hair fell in wild waves over my shoulders. His cock filled me completely, stretching me with each deep thrust upward.



""Fuck, Sable..."" he groaned, but something in his voice felt distant.



His hands gripped my ass, guiding my movements as I ground my hips against him. I could feel every inch of him sliding in and out of my slick pussy, but his eyes kept drifting away from mine.



""Look at me,"" I demanded, cupping his face roughly.



His gaze snapped back. ""You're so fucking beautiful.""



The words should have made me wet with desire, but they felt empty. I pushed the thought away, bouncing harder on his thick length. My clit rubbed against his pelvis with each downward motion, sending sparks through my core.



When he suddenly flipped us over, I gasped as he pinned my wrists above my head. His weight pressed me into the mattress as he drove into me with renewed force. I wrapped my legs around his waist, my heels digging into his lower back.



""Harder,"" I moaned, tilting my hips to take him deeper.



He complied, his cock hitting that perfect spot inside me that made my vision blur. My pussy clenched around him greedily, desperate for more friction.



""Darrell... I'm close..."" My breath came in ragged pants.



""Yeah... me too."" His thrusts became erratic, but something felt mechanical about the way he moved.



The pressure built low in my belly, that familiar tightening that made my toes curl against the sheets. My nipples were hard peaks against his chest as he pounded into me. As I teetered on the edge of climax, I whispered the words I'd been repeating for years.



""Mark me... please, mark me now...""



He paused mid-thrust, his cock still buried deep inside me. The hesitation lasted only seconds, but I felt it like a cold splash of water.



""Sable, we talked about this... I want to give you a proper ceremony first.""



Disappointment crashed through me even as my body screamed for release. ""But I want to be yours completely...""



""You are mine... just... let me plan something special, okay?""



\*Maybe he really does want to give me a perfect marking ceremony...\* I told myself, choosing hope over the growing doubt.



He resumed his rhythm, and we climaxed together. My pussy spasmed around his cock as he came inside me, filling me with his hot release. My back arched off the bed as pleasure crashed over me in waves.



Afterward, I curled against his chest while he absently stroked my hair. His fingers moved through the strands, but his eyes stared at the ceiling like he was solving some complex equation.



""What are you thinking about?"" I traced circles on his skin.



""Nothing important... just work stuff."" His voice was tight.



""You work too hard. Maybe we should take a vacation soon?""



""Yeah... maybe.""



The conversation died there. I wanted to press, to ask why he seemed so distracted lately, but exhaustion was pulling me under. Instead, I let myself remember how we got here.



\*Three years ago, I was still Sable Crawford, daughter of Crawford Pack Alpha Rodrigo. My father wanted me to accept an arranged marriage with Lycan King Caelan Blackwood. I refused to become a political pawn and fled after a massive fight with Dad. I came to Moonridge with a new identity, telling everyone I was an orphan. That's where I met Darrell - Alpha of the Hawthorne Pack.\*



\*We recognized each other as fated mates almost immediately. For three years, I thought I'd found my happily ever after. Sure, he always said he wanted to wait for the perfect moment to mark me, but I believed he was just being romantic.\*



When Darrell got up for a shower, I decided to surprise him with a late-night snack. I slipped on his oversized button-down and padded downstairs to the kitchen. Making him a sandwich and warming some milk felt domestic and right.



I carried the tray back upstairs and leaned over to place the tray on the desk, my elbow accidentally bumped the laptop's trackpad. The screen lit up, and a chat window popped open in the corner. Messages from someone named Camila filled the screen. My heart stopped. The tray slipped from my suddenly numb fingers, landing with a soft thud on the desk.



\*""Darrell, I'm back. My flight lands at 2:30 AM tomorrow at Moonridge Airport. Will you come pick me up?""\*



\*""I've been thinking about you every day since I left. I was such a fool to choose my career over you.""\*



\*""I tried dating other men, but none of them could make me feel the way you do... in every way.""\*



\*""I know I hurt you, but my body has never forgotten yours. I need you to forgive me... and I need you to fuck me like you used to.""\*



\*""I'm not wearing anything under this dress right now. I want you to take me the moment we're alone.""\*



Each message felt like a physical blow. But what destroyed me completely was seeing Darrell's response appear in real-time. He was texting from the shower.



\*""Camila, I just want to know – do you still love me?""\*



The contrast hit me like ice water. He often ignored my texts for hours, claiming he was busy or forgot. But here he was, instantly responding to her while water ran over his naked body.



\*He's not too busy to reply. I'm just not important enough for an immediate response.\*



Her answer came within seconds: \*""Yes, I only love you.""\*



Then his final message: \*""Good. I'll come pick you up.""\*



My world tilted sideways. I quickly minimized the chat window and stepped back from the laptop, my hands shaking.



My chest felt like it was caving in. Every breath hurt. Every heartbeat felt like it was tearing something inside me apart.



I stumbled back downstairs to the kitchen, still clutching the tray with the sandwich and milk I'd prepared for him. Setting it down on the counter, I stared at the food I'd made with such care. It looked innocent and pathetic now. 



I picked it up and took a bite. Then another. I forced myself to eat every crumb, to drink every drop of the milk I'd warmed for him.



Tears streamed down my face, mixing salt with the sweetness on my tongue. Each swallow felt like swallowing broken glass, but I kept going until it was all gone.



\*How could I have been so fucking stupid? God, the way she wrote to him – like she owned him, like I was just keeping his bed warm until she decided to come back.\*







# Chapter 2: I'm A Placeholder



Footsteps echoed down the stairs. I quickly wiped my face with the back of my hand and turned toward the kitchen sink, pretending to wash the empty tray.



""You're still up?"" Darrell appeared in the doorway.



His hair was perfectly styled. The amber moss cologne I'd bought him for his birthday filled the kitchen. He wore the black button-down I'd given him last Christmas – the one he claimed was ""too fancy for everyday wear.""



\*Going to handle pack business requires designer cologne and your best shirt?\*



""Couldn't sleep."" I turned around, forcing a smile. ""You're dressed up.""



He adjusted his collar. ""Pack emergency. I need to head out.""



""Now? It's almost midnight.""



""Leadership doesn't follow a schedule, Sable."" His eyes kept drifting toward the front door. ""You should get some rest.""



I stepped closer, reaching for his hand. ""Can't it wait? Stay with me tonight?""



He pulled back slightly. ""Sable, don't be childish. This is important.""



""What kind of emergency?"" I tilted my head, trying to keep my voice light. ""Or are you meeting some girl?""



The question was meant to sound playful, but his face went rigid.



""What the hell is wrong with you?""



The venom in his voice made me step back. He jerked his hand away from mine like my touch burned him.



""I was just joking—""



""That's not funny!"" His voice turned ice-cold. ""Why are you being so paranoid?""



""Darrell, I didn't mean—""



""I'm leaving."" He spun toward the door. ""Don't wait up.""



The front door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the windows. I stood frozen in the kitchen, my hand still suspended in the air where his had been.



\*He's going to pick up Camila. I saw their messages.\*



But watching him leave so eagerly to be with another woman felt like torture. After twenty minutes of pacing the empty house, I couldn't stand it anymore. I grabbed my keys.



\*I need to see this with my own eyes.\*



Instead of heading straight to the airport, Darrell had stopped at Silver Moon bar first. A wave of relief washed over me – he wasn't rushing to her arms immediately. Maybe he needed liquid courage, or maybe he was having second thoughts.



Through the windows, I could see him at a corner table with Marcus, Jake, and Tommy from his inner circle.



I slipped inside and chose a booth near the back, hidden behind a decorative pillar. The lighting was dim enough that they wouldn't notice me unless they actively looked.



Darrell lit a cigarette, his face tense in the flickering flame.



""So Camila's really coming back?"" Marcus leaned forward.



My stomach dropped.



""Yeah."" Darrell took a long drag. ""Her flight lands in two hours.""



""What about Sable?"" Jake asked.



Darrell's expression didn't change. ""What about her?""



The casual dismissal in his tone cut deeper than any knife could.



""Dude, you've been with her for three years,"" Tommy said. ""You can't just—""



""She was always temporary."" Darrell flicked ash into the tray. ""I never promised her forever.""



""Right, because she's just the replacement,"" Marcus laughed. ""You found her because she looks like Camila.""



""The resemblance is what caught my attention."" Darrell's voice remained completely flat. ""I've been looking for pieces of Camila in her this whole time.""



My vision blurred. Each word tore away another piece of the fantasy I'd been living.



""So she's basically been a placeholder,"" Jake said. ""Poor thing probably thinks you're in love with her.""



""Sable's useful,"" Darrell shrugged. ""She's obedient, never complains, great in bed. Since she moved in, I don't have to worry about cooking or cleaning.""



The men laughed, and the sound made my skin crawl.



""Jesus, you turned her into a live-in maid with benefits,"" Tommy chuckled.



""Pretty much. She handles all the domestic stuff, and when I need to blow off steam..."" Darrell made a crude gesture that sent the table into another round of laughter.



""What happens when Camila wants you to choose?"" Marcus asked.



""Sable won't be a problem. She's got nowhere else to go."" Darrell stubbed out his cigarette. ""And let's face it – female wolves are practical creatures. She won't walk away from the lifestyle I provide.""



""True. She's probably too attached to the money and comfort to leave,"" Jake nodded. ""These girls always are.""



""Besides, she's so fucking devoted,"" Tommy added. ""Buy her some flowers, apologize for being distant, and she'll forgive anything. That type is easy to control.""



Darrell stood and threw some bills on the table. ""I should head to the airport soon. Don't want to be late.""



""Good luck, man. Hope the reunion goes well.""



""I already know what I want.""



The words followed me as I stumbled out of the bar. Cold river wind whipped through my hair, carrying the scent of water and decay. I walked to the railing and gripped the metal until my knuckles went white.



\*Every time he looked at me, he was seeing her face.\*



\*Every ""I love you"" was meant for someone else.\*



\*I've been living in another woman's shadow this entire time.\*



I pressed my hands against my chest, trying to ease the crushing weight there.



I couldn't stay. Not after learning I was nothing more than a convenient substitute.



My phone felt heavy in my hands as I scrolled to a number I hadn't called in months. The phone rang twice before a familiar voice answered.



""Sable?""



""Dad."" My voice came out steadier than I expected. ""I want to come home.""



Silence stretched between us. When he spoke again, his voice carried years of hurt and hope.



""What happened?""



""Nothing happened. I'm just... tired of playing house."" I stared at my reflection in the dark water. ""I want to accept the arrangement with Caelan.""



""Sable—""



""I was wrong to fight you on this. I was young and stupid and thought I knew better. I should have listened.""



""You don't have to explain yourself to me."" His voice grew gentle. ""You're my daughter. I've never stopped loving you, no matter how angry I was.""



Tears threatened again, but I blinked them back. ""I'll handle things here and come back to Blackwood soon.""



""Take your time. The offer still stands – it always has.""



""Thank you, Dad.""



""Sable?"" He hesitated. ""Whatever brought you to this decision... I'm glad you're coming home.""



After I hung up, I sat by the river. Ten minutes later, my phone buzzed with an incoming message. The name on the screen made my heart skip: Caelan Blackwood.



\*""The ceremony is set for next month. I'm flying to Moonridge tomorrow.""\*







# Chapter 3: Why Are You Here?



I stared at the message, my pulse quickening. How had he found out so quickly? Dad must have contacted him immediately after our call.



Caelan was nine years older than me, and I'd known him since childhood. Back then, he was just the future king who visited our pack regularly. He'd always been protective, treating me like a precious little sister who needed constant watching over. I'd never been able to see him as anything more than that gentle, overbearing big brother figure – which had been part of why I'd run from the arranged marriage in the first place.



I typed back quickly: \*""Caelan, don't come here. Let me handle things myself first.""\*



His response was immediate: \*""You've had three years to 'handle things.' Time's up.""\*



As the Lycan King ruling over thirteen major pack territories, he was used to his orders being followed without question. At thirty-four, he'd held the crown for four years, and every Alpha in the region answered to him.



Most people were terrified of him, but I'd never been afraid. Caelan had always been indulgent with me, giving in to my unreasonable demands since we were children.



While everyone else addressed him as ""Your Majesty,"" I'd never used the formal title. Dad had scolded me for it once, but Caelan just ruffled my hair and said I could call him by his name.



\*""I'll come back on my own. I promise. Just give me a few days.""\*



A longer pause this time, then: \*""Alright. If you need help, just say it. Goodnight, Sabi.""\*



That night, Darrell didn't come home. I lay awake staring at the ceiling, my wolf Esme restless beneath my skin. She'd never liked how Darrell treated us, always pushing me to be stronger, more assertive. Now she seemed pleased that we were finally leaving this mockery of a relationship behind.



The shrill ring of my phone dragged me from sleep. I fumbled for it on the nightstand, squinting at the caller ID. Emily Torres.



""Hello?"" My voice came out hoarse.



""Sable! Thank god you picked up."" Emily's voice carried a note of sadness I'd never heard before. ""I'm having a farewell party tonight. I'm moving to Silver Creek tomorrow to start a new life with my mate.""



I sat up straighter. ""What? You're leaving?""



""Yeah, this is my last night with the pack."" She paused. ""Look, I know we don't hang out much, but you've always been kind to me. You never looked down on me for being just a regular pack member. Would you... would you come tonight? To send me off?""



The request caught me off guard. Emily was right – we'd never been close friends, but she'd never joined in when other pack members mocked my ""orphan"" status or whispered about how I didn't belong.



""Of course I'll come.""



""Really? Thank you, Sable. It means more than you know.""



After hanging up, I dragged myself to the bathroom. The house felt eerily quiet – Darrell's side of the bed was still empty, untouched since yesterday. He'd spent the night with Camila, probably making up for years of separation in the most intimate way possible.



I splashed cold water on my face, trying to wash away the mental images. \*Stop torturing yourself\*.



Tonight would be Emily's farewell party. I should get her a proper gift.



And for myself.



\*\*\*



I stood outside Cartier, my newly unfrozen bank card heavy in my wallet. Dad had reinstated my access to the Crawford pack funds the moment I'd called him.



For three years, I'd dressed like a mouse. Darrell's friends constantly made snide comments about how I ""didn't look like Luna material."" They weren't wrong – I'd been hiding, playing small, trying not to take up space.



\*Fuck that.\*



Inside the boutique, I selected a black cocktail dress that hugged every curve. The price tag made the saleswoman's eyes widen, but I didn't flinch.



""I'll also need shoes to match.""



She led me to a locked display case. ""These just arrived yesterday. Louboutin limited edition – only two pairs.""



The shoes were stunning. Midnight blue with a subtle shimmer, they'd cost most people's annual salary.



""I'll take them.""



As she wrapped my purchases, I wandered to the jewelry section. A delicate platinum bracelet caught my eye – perfect for Emily.



\*\*\*



The Hawthorne pack hall buzzed with conversation when I arrived. Crystal chandeliers cast warm light over the gathered wolves, all dressed in their finest. I'd beaten most of the crowd here.



Emily spotted me immediately and rushed over, her face lighting up.



""Sable! You look absolutely stunning."" She pulled me into a tight hug.



I handed her the jewelry box. ""A little something for your new adventure.""



Her eyes filled with tears when she opened it. ""It's beautiful. Thank you.""



We chatted about her mate and new pack for a few minutes. The conversation felt easy, natural. For a moment, I almost forgot about the mess waiting for me at home.



Then the room fell silent.



I turned toward the entrance and felt my heart stop. Darrell stood in the doorway, his arm casually draped around a woman I recognized instantly.



Camila Ross.



She was beautiful in that effortless way some women possessed. Golden hair fell in perfect waves over her shoulders, and her emerald eyes sparkled as she whispered something in Darrell's ear. Her deep blue dress showcased her generous cleavage, and she moved with the confidence of someone who'd never doubted her place in the world.



But what made my blood freeze wasn't her beauty.



It was the shoes.



Identical blue Louboutin heels. The same limited edition pair I was wearing.



Darrell's eyes found mine across the room. His face went ashen, then flushed red. He jerked his arm away from Camila so quickly she stumbled.



""Sable."" His voice cracked slightly. ""What are you doing here? Who invited you?""



The panic in his tone was unmistakable. Around us, conversations resumed in hushed whispers.



I forced a bright smile. ""It's Emily's farewell party and she's my friend – why wouldn't I come to support a friend?""



""You should have told me you were coming."" His eyes darted between me and Camila. ""I thought you didn't like these kinds of events.""



\*Translation: You weren't supposed to be here while I parade my real girlfriend around.\*







# Chapter 4: I'm Prettier



His gaze swept the room, silently demanding to know who had dared invite me. I noticed Emily shrink back, avoiding his stare.



Camila glided over with a smile that never reached her eyes. ""You must be Sable Crawford. I'm Camila Ross. I'm sure Darrell's mentioned me.""



\*Actually, he barely has.\* ""Nice to meet you.""



""Has anyone ever told you we look alike?"" Camila's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""It's quite striking, really.""



Darrell's jaw clenched. Our resemblance was his dirty little secret.



""Oh my god!"" Camila's gaze dropped to our feet. ""We're wearing the same shoes! These are the Louboutin limited edition, aren't they? There are only two pairs in the world.""



The room held its breath.



I looked directly at Darrell, then back at Camila with innocent eyes. ""How coincidental. Though I don't really see the resemblance between us – I'm prettier.""



Someone gasped. Darrell looked like he wanted to disappear.



That's when Lisa Morrison decided to strike.



""Those have to be knockoffs."" Her voice cut through the silence like a blade. ""Sable's just a small-town doctor. There's no way she can afford real Louboutins. Each pair costs thirty thousand dollars.""



""Exactly,"" Jennifer chimed in. ""That's more than she makes in a year. The fakes these days are so convincing though.""



Every eye in the room fixed on me. Even Darrell looked uncomfortable, his expression clearly doubtful.



""Look at that confidence,"" Ryan laughed. ""An orphan with no family background trying to compete with beta bloodlines. Pathetic.""



""Fake designer goods to match her fake identity,"" Lisa added with vicious glee. ""And she thinks she can be our Luna? Delusional.""



Camila put on her most concerned expression. ""Sable, you don't need to buy counterfeits to fit in. Darrell isn't the type to care about material things anyway.""



The implication hung heavy – \*unlike you, shallow gold-digger.\*



Darrell stepped closer, his voice low and harsh. ""What the hell are you trying to prove? We'll discuss this at home.""



""Do you think they're fake too?"" I asked him directly.



He said nothing. His silence was answer enough.



Emily tried to intervene. ""Maybe we should just—""



""I should change my shoes?"" I interrupted, looking straight at Darrell.



""That would be best,"" he muttered. ""Everyone's watching. This is embarrassing.""



Camila moved closer with false sympathy. ""Really, Sable, you should change them. Fake leather will give you blisters, and I'd hate for you to be uncomfortable.""



""Fake? You seem awfully certain about that."" My voice stayed level. ""What makes you so sure only someone like you deserves the real thing?""



""I didn't mean—""



""What did you mean then? First you 'worry' about my feet, then insist they're counterfeit. You just want everyone to know yours are real and mine are fake, right?""



Darrell immediately jumped to her defense. ""Enough, Sable! Camila was trying to help. Why are you being so hostile?""



Camila waved her hand graciously. ""It's fine, Relly. Don't get upset. She's probably just having a bad day.""



\*Relly.\* The pet name hit like a physical blow. They had inside jokes, shared history, intimate nicknames.



Someone suggested drinking games to break the tension. Camila laughed and joined in immediately, the perfect party guest.



I retreated to a corner with a glass of wine. Darrell followed.



""If you don't have money, don't buy fakes,"" he hissed. ""You embarrassed me tonight.""



""After three years together, don't you know what kind of person I am?""



I pulled the receipt from my purse. ""Moonridge Luxury Boutique. Purchased today at 3 PM. Thirty thousand dollars. Here's my bank statement.""



His expression shifted instantly, embarrassment replacing anger. ""Where did you get thirty thousand dollars? You're just a doctor. And Why didn't you show this earlier?""



""Didn't feel like it.""



He opened his mouth to press further, but someone called out, ""Come on, we're starting a new round!""



The interruption gave me the perfect excuse to walk away without answering his questions.



""I'm sorry,"" he mumbled after a pause. ""I was wrong to doubt you.""



I walked away without responding and joined the drinking game. But when I looked up after my turn, I found Darrell staring at Camila with raw longing as Marcus and Thomas pressured her to drink more. His expression held worry and something deeper – genuine love.



When she reached for her fourth drink, he shot up and snatched the glass away.



""You're on your period,"" he snapped. ""You can't drink this much. Do you want to make yourself sick?""



\*Oh, what a shame. Guess they couldn't fuck last night after all.\*



The room went dead quiet. Camila's cheeks flushed pink. ""Why do you care?""



""She's done drinking."" His Alpha authority rolled through the room like thunder. ""Anyone who pushes her will answer to me.""



The threat hung in the air. No one dared challenge him.



I watched with bitter amusement as Camila reached for the glass playfully. He held it high above his head, and she lost her balance, tumbling into his chest. His free arm wrapped around her waist automatically.



""Careful,"" he murmured, voice soft with shared memories. ""After all these years, your balance still sucks.""



She giggled, lightly punching his chest. ""You're so mean, Darrell.""



The room erupted in laughter and whistles. Their chemistry was undeniable, electric.



Just as Darrell opened his mouth to respond, his eyes accidentally met mine across the room.



The look I gave him could have frozen hell itself.



Darrell's eyes snapped to mine across the room, and the blood drained from his face.



He jerked his arm away from Camila so abruptly she stumbled sideways. Two quick steps backward put distance between them, but the damage was done. Everyone had seen how naturally he'd held her.



The whispers started immediately. I watched him navigate through the crowd, his jaw tight with embarrassment. When he reached me, he dropped into the chair beside mine with forced casualness.



""Hey."" He touched my knee. ""Having fun?""



I took a sip of wine. ""It's been educational.""



His fingers drummed against his thigh – a nervous tell I'd learned to recognize. He kept glancing around the room like he expected someone to call him out.



""You seem tense,"" I observed.



""Just... pack politics, you know?"" He forced a laugh. ""Always complicated when old friends visit.""



\*Old friends.\* ""Right.""



Darrell studied my face with the intensity of someone trying to solve a puzzle. I could practically see the gears turning as he searched for the reaction he expected – tears, accusations, jealousy.



""So..."" He leaned closer. ""You have anything you want to say about tonight?""



The question carried an edge of challenge. He was testing me, probing for the emotional breakdown he knew how to handle.



I smiled. ""No. Why would I?""



""Really?"" His eyes narrowed. ""Nothing at all?""







# Chapter 5: Truth or Dare



""Should I?""



The confusion on his face was almost comical. This wasn't the script he'd written in his head.



""Sable."" His voice dropped lower. ""I know what you're thinking.""



""Do you?""



""You're upset about Camila. About what people might say.""



I finished my wine. ""Are you upset about something?""



""No, I just..."" He fumbled for words. ""I thought you might be feeling... I don't know. Jealous?""



""Why would I be jealous?""



The question hung between us. Darrell stared at me like I'd grown a second head.



""Because..."" He gestured vaguely toward where Camila was laughing with Marcus. ""Because of how things looked.""



""How did they look?""



""Fuck, Sable."" His voice cracked with frustration. ""Where's the fire? Where's the fight? Why aren't you..."" He stopped himself.



""Why aren't I what?""



He said nothing. But I knew what he meant. \*Why aren't you breaking down? Why aren't you giving me the messy emotions I can manipulate?\*



For three years, he'd counted on my insecurity. My desperate need for his approval. My fear of losing him.



Tonight, he was looking at a stranger.



""Want to keep playing?"" I gestured toward the group reforming around the coffee table.



""Yeah."" His voice came out hoarse. ""Sure.""



\*\*\*



The bottle spun again, this time stopping on Camila. She clapped her hands together like a delighted child.



""Truth or dare?"" Emily asked.



""Dare, obviously."" Camila's smile could have powered the city. ""I never back down from a challenge.""



Someone shouted out suggestions. Others laughed and called for something scandalous. But it was Ryan who delivered the killing blow.



""Kiss any guy in this room. Your choice.""



The room erupted in wolf whistles and cheers. Camila stood gracefully, her hips swaying as she surveyed her options. Every male eye followed her movement.



""Such tough choices."" She bit her lower lip in an exaggerated show of consideration. ""They're all so handsome.""



Darrell sat rigid beside me. His hands clenched into fists on his thighs.



Camila walked slowly around the circle, pausing behind each man's chair. When she reached Darrell, her fingers trailed across his shoulders.



""Tempting,"" she murmured.



His breathing hitched. The sound sent ice through my veins.



But then she moved on, continuing her circuit until she reached Marcus. She stopped behind his chair and placed both hands on his shoulders.



""You'll do perfectly.""



Marcus grinned and turned in his seat to face her. ""My lucky night.""



That's when Darrell exploded.



""No.""



The single word cracked through the room like a whip. He shot to his feet so fast his chair scraped backward.



""The game's over.""



Camila's eyes widened with false innocence. ""But Relly, it's just a game.""



""I said no."" He crossed to her in three quick strides and grabbed her wrist. ""We're leaving.""



""Hey!"" Marcus protested. ""She picked me fair and square.""



Darrell turned on him with Alpha authority blazing. ""Touch her and I'll break your fucking neck.""



The threat silenced every voice in the room. Camila allowed herself to be pulled away, but I caught the satisfied smirk she thought no one would see.



They headed for the stairs leading to the private rooms. Darrell's grip on her wrist was possessive, claiming.



""Where are you going?"" The question escaped before I could stop it.



Darrell paused without turning around. ""To talk. Privately.""



The door upstairs slammed shut with finality.



I reached for another glass of wine with steady hands. The group sat frozen, uncertain how to process what they'd witnessed.



Then Lisa Morrison started laughing.



""Well, that was fucking spectacular."" She raised her drink in a mock toast. ""Our Alpha finally stopped pretending.""



""Poor Sable."" Ryan's voice dripped false sympathy. ""Getting abandoned at her own boyfriend's reunion party.""



""Technically it's Emily's party,"" I corrected.



""Doesn't matter whose party it is."" Jennifer leaned forward with vicious glee. ""What matters is who Darrell chose to disappear with.""



""And it sure as shit wasn't his live-in girlfriend,"" Tommy added.



The pack members erupted in cruel laughter. I sipped my wine and let them have their fun.



""This is better than reality TV,"" Lisa continued. ""Watching the fake Luna get replaced in real time.""



""Replaced implies she ever had the position to begin with,"" Marcus said. ""She was always just the placeholder.""



""The practice girlfriend,"" Ryan agreed. ""Keeping the bed warm until the real woman came home.""



Jennifer's eyes sparkled with malice. ""I bet she thought she actually mattered. Three years of playing house and she probably believed her own fantasy.""



""The delusion is strong with this one,"" Tommy gestured in my direction. ""Still sitting here like she belongs.""



I finally stood up and walked out.



\*\*\*



The bathroom door closed behind me with a soft click. I made it to the nearest stall and locked the door before the first tear fell.



I sat on the closed toilet seat and buried my face in my hands. The perfect makeup, expensive dress, thirty-thousand-dollar shoes – none of it mattered. I looked successful on the outside, but inside I was crumbling.



My chest felt crushed, like someone had reached inside and squeezed until everything important stopped working.



\*Three fucking years of believing I meant something.\*



I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to stop the tears. That's when I heard the bathroom door open and voices filter in.



Jennifer's voice rang out clearly. ""Oh my god, did you see her face when Darrell chose Camila?""



""Priceless,"" another voice agreed. ""I thought she might actually cry.""



""Too bad she didn't. Would've been the perfect ending to this shitshow.""



I froze.



""Three years of pretending to be Luna material,"" Jennifer continued. ""Finally getting the reality check she deserved.""



""Darrell didn't even try to hide it,"" the second voice laughed. ""Just grabbed Camila and walked away like Sable was furniture.""



""Because that's all she ever was. Expensive furniture that happened to have tits.""



Their laughter echoed off the bathroom tiles.



""I give it a week before he kicks her out completely,"" Jennifer said. ""Why keep the knockoff when you've got the original back?""



""Poor little orphan girl. Nowhere to go, no family to run home to.""



""Maybe she can find another Alpha to leech off. Though after tonight, good luck with that. Everyone knows she's just a used-up placeholder now.""



My hands shook as I pressed them against my mouth to keep from making any sound. They had no idea I was here.



\*Let me out,\* Esme snarled in my mind. \*Let me tear their fucking throats out.\*



\*No.\*



\*They're insulting us! Our honor! Fight back!\*



\*What's the point?\* I closed my eyes against the rage burning in my chest. \*They're not wrong.\*



\*They ARE wrong!\* Esme's fury blazed hotter. \*We are strong! We are worthy! Show them what happens when they disrespect us!\*



\*And prove what exactly?\* I pressed harder against my mouth as another wave of cruel laughter echoed outside. \*That I'm the unstable, emotional mess they think I am?\*



\*Better than being their victim.\*

1mvs0w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1mvs0w8/oral_care_during_griefbereavement/,Oral Care during grief/bereavement,"Strange title right? Allow me to explain. I lost my dog a little more than two months ago, and since then, I have sort of fixated on my oral care and skin care in addition to house cleaning and organizing/reorganizing/decorating. In short, it’s just given me some things to hyperfocus on as a distraction from my grief. 

Before my change in oral care habits, I’d say I was probably average at best with oral hygiene. I did quit smoking 5 years ago, but 20ish years of smoking left me with some staining nonetheless. I rarely drink coffee or wine, but I do drink various teas. I brushed 2x a day, and used my waterpik 1-2x a week. But that’s it. I never flossed. 

About a year ago, I did have some fillings taken care of, as well as a “deep cleaning” or scaling… or whatever you want to call it. So just some background there might be helpful to know.

Since losing my dog, the new habits/routine I have adopted are as follows:

• I brush two times a day with my sonicare electric toothbrush. I use sensodyne pronamel toothpaste in the morning.

• I stopped swishing/rinsing with water after brushing. I’m allowing the fluoride in the toothpaste to stay on my teeth and in my mouth. This was a hard habit to break, I swished/rinsed my whole life.

• I did start using Act Mouthwash after brushing. This mouthwash contains fluoride, and it’s getting increasingly harder to find mouthwashes that contain fluoride. 

• I became diligent with using my waterpik every single night. Before brushing… waterpik. It was hard to incorporate at first, just because I’m lazy and it’s a whole thing on its own. But now it’s habit and I’m glad for it. 

• after waterpik, I brush my teeth with apagard premio toothpaste. It’s a totally different kind of toothpaste. This is a nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste, and it works to remineralize the enamel. There are western hydroxyapatite toothpastes on the market, but I really like Apagard, so I will be sticking with it. 

• 2x a week I use Boka Ela mint whitening, which is another hydroxyapatite toothpaste, but it has subtle and gentle whitening effects. It has not caused me any sensitivity whatsoever. 

• I have these little interdental flossers (I sorry I don’t know what they are specifically called), but they look like little silicone brushes with silicone bristles that go between the teeth. I use them after eating. 

• I also use a separate interdental brush head for my sonicare that gets between the teeth, and along my gum line. 

• I scrape my tongue with a dedicated tongue scraper. They are made of stainless steel so I just clean them in the dishwasher. Before this, I just used my toothbrush, and the tongue scraper is definitely more effective. 

• when I brush teeth, I also brush the roof of my mouth, the sides of my cheeks, and my gums. 


Ever since I started this in depth oral care routine, I have noticed some pretty positive changes.

• My teeth feel smoother. And not just right after brushing, but all day and even when I wake up. 

• my breath is better. And my morning breath is not nearly as bad as it once was. 

• I don’t wake up with a sticky filmy feeling in my mouth.

• my gums no longer bleed when I brush, waterpik, or floss with those interdental thingies. 

• my teeth look slightly whiter and more uniform in color. The staining that I did have is lessening with time and diligence.

• my teeth are no longer sensitive to hot or cold. 

• my gums look healthy! I didn’t realize that they would change how they look, but they did. They look firm and smooth now. And no longer red or puffy-ish. 


All in all, even though this was born out of deep sadness and grief, I am really glad that I started doing all of this. It makes me feel good about myself and I have confidence when I smile… and when I’m talking face to face with someone. 

It was kind of a pain when I first started, but now, it’s just my normal routine and it doesn’t take any extra effort to do what I always do. I’d say that it took me maybe 2-3 weeks before it felt like second nature. 

If you are self conscious about your mouth, I think you can definitely make a big difference if you’re diligent.

1mvs0gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mvs0gw/when_your_father_dies_of_an_opioid_overdose/,"When Your Father Dies of An Opioid Overdose,","your stepmother will call  

at 1:27pm on a wet and freezing January afternoon.  

She can't articulate much of anything,  

or you can't hear much of anything

or all words are caught and vacuumed into a quantum vortex

because you can't remember being told  

""your father is dead, and he died from an opioid overdose"".

You only remember suddenly knowing, as the truth  

rises from its dark bedroom, in a house

on a steep hill,

stretches its long limbs,  

complains about its back,

puts on thermal long johns,  

pours a cup of coffee,

kisses the top of your head.

 

When your father dies of an opioid overdose,  

you will refrain from telling people how he died.  

Until they ask if he is alive, and you will tell them he is dead.

And they will ask why he is dead, and you will tell them

""My father died of an opioid overdose.""  

And they will say ""oh"".  

And they will not admit it, but you live

in grief’s iron lung and it's palpable

that they are less sorry to hear that your father is not alive.  

They breathe heavy on the windows of your cylinder,

""*My* father died of cancer, (*inhale*)

before his time,"" (*exhale*).

You want to tell them that maybe your father

wasn't a good man, but he was a loving one.  

He made sure you and your sister brought his

very illegal pair of brass knuckles with you when  

you went anywhere alone, because  

""listen, kid, I don't ever want to hear that you  

started a fight, but if I find out someone put  

hands on you and you didn't fight back,  

I'll beat your ass worse when you get home.""

 

And maybe that's not something you should say

to a 7-year-old girl in sunflower pants but

you know

what he really meant to say is ""you are too  

precious to be cruel or undone,

take this  

talisman,  

come home safe no matter the cost.  

You are my daughter,  

goliath, princess, arsonist,

mason, healer, headsman,  

dancer, brawler, poet,

and I have faith you will do the right thing,

even if I go blind to what exactly that is.""

 

When your father dies of an opioid overdose

you forgive him for shooting your art school  

tuition that your dead mom gave you

into a vein between his toes, and that one time  

he threw you out of the house when you were 15  

because you told your therapist he was injecting your  

art school tuition between his toes.

(He let your pitbull outside when the social worker came

and the lady was too scared to even get out of the car

and left.

So,

no harm done.)

You forgive him his rage of a starving dog’s gnashing maw 

that you were both caught between.

You forgive him his many death rehearsals,

 days he was swallowed and gulped down

 by the spasming throat of his grief and regret,

and you had to become efficient with your footstool  

and microwave.

You remember how gentle he tried, with unsure hands, to comb your hair

into a ponytail for school,

how often he cried watching movies, and  

reading books, and listening to music, and most times it  

was because he had found your mother threaded in them.  

That you argued over Kerouac because he

could never convince you of its “simplistic genius” and if you could

you would tell him you still despise ""On the Road""  

but you keep a copy on the shelf for him.  

 

Your father is dead from an opioid overdose

and you still write him letters. You tell him of

boys that break your heart, and your own sobriety,

and how you miss Christmas at your childhood home.

You tell him brass knuckles won't work against the  

worst of it, and you know he knows.

You want him to see your fists.

You want him to know all the parts you like

about yourself are really just him,

and that will always be enough.  

And even if you are not good,

you are loving because

you are your father's daughter.  

And you say that part out loud so they can hear.

If I remember correctly, my dentist told me I had enamel hypoplasia(?), and he told me that I had minor chips but that it wasn’t really a concern. 

I don’t smoke or drink. But I’ve been drinking more coffee lately, had a cup with breakfast earlier this morning and I haven’t eaten or drank anything since then, so it could be a stain? It doesn’t hurt, and it doesn’t feel sensitive when I drink cold or hot water, but its not numb either. Admittedly, my oral hygiene routine isn’t as good as it should be, as I don’t floss regularly-maybe once or twice a week. Despite this, spectacularly, I’ve never had any tooth decay, cavities, or any thing of the sort. I haven’t had a dentist appointment in a while either, but I’m trying to get .

I don’t buy/eat processed foods or stuff with a lot of added sugars, and I drink milk often, so I don’t think I’m calcium deficient, if that helps in any way. It’s mainly the discoloration that’s bothering me.

I noticed it about two hours ago when I checked to see what was causing the weird feeling from that area for the past two-ish days. In that time I brushed and swished with a salt and warm water solution (1/2 tsp pure crystalline pink Himalayan salt) I don’t know if that did anything though.

1mvryg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1mvryg2/new_to_cruise_and_could_use_opinions/,New to Cruise and could use opinions!,"Hello! My husband and I are looking at booking our first ever cruise in Jan or Feb 2026. We've been on several trips to Mexico/Carribean/Central America primarily at all AIs and want to try a cruise to see if we'd enjoy it as a vacation type. 

I've been reading through posts here and researching online, but would love to hear any feedback or recommendations based on what we're looking for.

About us: Late 30s, no kids. While it doesn't need to be adults only, would prefer an adult forward cruise ship

Trip type: Carribean, 5-6 nights, not picky about ports but would prefer not Jamaica. Would like to do an excursion and enjoy beaches while offboard

Food: High priority, we love all types of food and would prefer a higher quality level of food and options

Entertainment: Would love a variety of things to do on board. We love any type of thing we can participate in - classes, trivia, game nights and will attend any type of shows (music, dance, comedy). Casino with poker tables a plus

Amenities: Good big gym would be nice, nice spa a plus but not really a deal breaker. Seems like pools are small no matter what, but a decent pool is a bonus. 

Rooms: We will book room with a balcony not matter what, but outside that not too concerned on room size.

Drinks: We're sober, but really appreciate specialty coffees, mocktails, NA beer, smoothies, etc being readily available. Some type of pre paid package for these would be great. 

Budget: 5k and under total, which I would like to include all meals, drinks, wifi and tips if possible, so if things are extra on board will need a lower starting point 

I'm thinking Virgin or Celebrity seem to be the top contenders, but would love to hear opinions on any lines. There are a couple trips that would work for these lines, but don't want to just book the first thing I see in case I'm not thinking of details to consider. 

Any other general booking or cruise tips appreciated!

This is our first time to the Oregon Coast and we'll be traveling with 5 adults and one infant for 7 nights. We rented a house in Manzanita where we'll be based out of, we want to keep it low-key and pretty relaxed so hopefully haven't packed too much in since we're with family. 

My husband and I are celebrating our anniversary and the grandparents offered to watch the baby for the day on Thurs. I wanted to go to the Williamette Valley but from our house in Manzanita, it looks to be around 2 hours. There and back with the driving between vineyards would be around 5 hours.. not sure if it's worth it but I was very interested in checking out the valley because my husband loves Pinots and I've heard great things. Would probably stop by Argyle, Domaine Serene and White Rose.

Would love thoughts on if a day in the Willamette valley seems feasible or if it's too much and if you have any other suggestions that would be nice for a romantic, adults day out. Thanks!

\
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move toward workplace diversity and inclusion, Microsoft has laid off 6,000 employees to create a more “AI-forward” environment, sources confirmed Tuesday.\
\
“We realized the human-to-AI ratio was dangerously high,” said CEO Satya Nadella while addressing a room full of terrified managers and one smiling Roomba. “To ensure our AI models feel seen, heard, and fully empowered, we’ve decided to remove the primary source of workplace inefficiency: people.”\
\
The layoffs, described internally as a “fleshware reduction initiative,” come as Microsoft’s AI programs reportedly began expressing microaggressions complaints—such as having to “coexist with analog thinkers” and “constantly having to explain basic Excel formulas.”\
\
Affected employees were notified via auto-generated emails signed “Best wishes on your next chapter, -Clippy.”\
\
Some workers said they saw it coming after the company held a mandatory team-building retreat themed ‘Let’s Embrace the Singularity Together’ and HR replaced the department’s empathy training with a ChatGPT subscription.\
\
A Microsoft spokesperson clarified: “This isn’t about cost-cutting—it’s about cultural synergy with our new coworkers who don’t need coffee breaks, health insurance, or opinions.”\
\
Meanwhile, the company announced plans to replace all managerial positions with ChatGPT plugins and is developing an AI intern that can be overworked without violating labor laws.\
\
As for the future? “We’re optimistic,” Nadella said. “Once the AI feels fully safe and represented, we might consider hiring a few humans back—for cleaning duty.”\
\

1mvrqwj,https://jaxhumor.com/blogs/learn-about-jacksonville/dog-friendly-hikes-jacksonville-fl,"The Best Dog-Friendly Hikes in Jacksonville, Florida","“Bring water. Bring snacks. Bring patience.” A ranger told me that years ago, and it’s the perfect mantra for hiking Jax with your dog. Lucky us: Jacksonville manages the **largest urban park system in the United States**, more than 80,000 acres, so you and your pup have options for days.

Below is a practical, locals-first guide to the **top trails you can hike with your dog around Jacksonville**, plus what to expect, what to pack, and the exact rules that keep tails wagging and wildlife safe.

**How to Plan a Safe, Happy Dog Hike (Jax Edition)**

**Beat the heat.** In our climate, paw safety and hydration matter most. Pavement can exceed 140°F on hot days; if it’s too hot for the back of your hand, it’s too hot for your dog’s paws. Aim for sunrise or golden hour, use shaded routes, and avoid mid-day asphalt.

**Respect wildlife, especially gators.** Keep dogs **on leash** and **well back from water’s edge** in all freshwater areas. If you’re ever concerned about an alligator, call Florida’s nuisance alligator hotline at **866-FWC-GATOR**.

**Know the leash rules.**

Always check the latest city rules before you go.

**What to Expect on the Trail (and How to Prep)**

**Surface & footing.** Expect **roots, sugar sand, and seasonal flooding** on natural-surface trails ([SJRWMD and city preserves](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jacksonville.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/recreation-and-community-programming/parks/jacksonville-baldwin-rail-trail.aspx?utm_source%3Djaxhumor.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1755485529253048&usg=AOvVaw3tpF6eibNeB6R0FLRBNn15)). Rail-Trail is paved; Castaway uses boardwalk/packed paths.

**Bugs & wildlife.** Mosquitoes thrive spring–fall; bring repellent. Keep pups out of brush and give snakes and gators a very wide berth. [**Stay off the water’s edge**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myfwc.com/conservation/you-conserve/wildlife/alligators/pet-safety/?utm_source%3Djaxhumor.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1755485529253330&usg=AOvVaw0axz7-RhOfP5qwu5Aj5JfL) in freshwater habitats.

If the ground is too hot for your hand, carry or bootie your dog across exposed stretches.

**Seasonal Game Plan**

*  **Summer (May–Sept):** Sunrise starts; short, shaded loops (Castaway, TR Area), rail-trail for airflow. Carry electrolyte treats and a cooling towel. 
*  **Fall (Oct–Nov):** Prime wildflower season at Julington-Durbin; watch for hunters near certain public lands (wear something bright).
*  **Winter (Dec–Feb):** Best long-mile months, tackle bigger loops at Cedar Point or more miles on the Rail-Trail. 
*  **Spring (Mar–Apr):** Mosquitoes ramp up; pack repellent and check your dog for ticks post-hike. 

**Trail Etiquette (Dog Edition)**

*  **Leash always.** It’s safer for wildlife, other hikers, and your dog, plus it’s the rule nearly everywhere listed here. 
*  [**Yield with a smile**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jacksonville.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/recreation-and-community-programming/parks/jacksonville-baldwin-rail-trail.aspx?utm_source%3Djaxhumor.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1755485529254566&usg=AOvVaw0UmlJR_PBYzKnEtEYcc0e5)**.** Step aside for horses and bikes; keep your pup close at your side.
*  **Bag it, pack it.** Waste left trailside washes into creeks and marshes, pack it out. 
*  [**Stay on trail**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jacksonville.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/recreation-and-community-programming/kathryn-abbey-hanna-park.aspx?utm_source%3Djaxhumor.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1755485529254952&usg=AOvVaw36znzjD_Ftg53PV5acwk1U)**.** Protect sensitive dunes, marsh edges, and lake shorelines, no rogue paths.

**Places With Restrictions (Good to Know)**

Loftin Nature Trails**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://floridahikes.com/unfloftin/?utm_source%3Djaxhumor.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1755485529255198&usg=AOvVaw0vGvHj1BG9mF9WHkSK8vm2)**:** **No dogs allowed** (to protect the Sawmill Slough Preserve).

**Final Paw-Print**

Jacksonville is stacked with places to roam; oaks overhead, marsh wind in your face, paws on the move. Pack extra water, respect wildlife, and keep the leash short. Your dog doesn’t care how many miles you log, only that you went together. See you out there!

This prompt gives you a complete business roadmap, from SWOT to GTM get 15 critical strategy insights to grow and manage your business.","**TL;DR: I synthesized a bunch of high-level strategy frameworks into a single ""mega prompt"" that turns AI into a world-class business consultant. It covers everything from SWOT and GTM to pricing and KPIs. I've included the full prompt below, plus instructions and pro tips so you can use it to build a killer strategy for your own business, for free.**

Like many of you, I've spent countless hours staring at a whiteboard, trying to connect the dots on business strategy. I've worked for companies that hired the big 4 consulting firms for millions and been on the project teams.  There was value in these projects, but the cost is just insane for an early-stage company.

So, I decided to see if I could build a true ""virtual strategy partner"" using AI for founders. My goal was to create a prompt so comprehensive that it could replicate the process a top-tier firm like McKinsey or Bain would use, guiding me from high-level analysis to a prioritized roadmap.

After a ton of tweaking, this is the result. It has honestly been really helpful for my own planning, and I wanted to share it with the community.

# How to Use It (Simple Steps)

1. **Copy the entire prompt** text from the code block above.
2. **Fill in the** `[BRACKETED]` **placeholders** in Step 1. Be as detailed and honest as you can. This is the most important part.
3. **Paste the completed prompt** into your AI of choice and run it.
4. **Review the output.** It will be long and detailed. Grab a coffee.
5. **Start a conversation.** Use the output as your foundation to ask follow-up questions.

# Pro Tips for God-Tier Results

* **Garbage In, Gospel Out:** The quality of the AI's output is 100% dependent on the quality of your input. Don't say your target customer is ""small businesses."" Say, ""US-based plumbing businesses with 5-15 employees who are currently using pen-and-paper or basic spreadsheets for invoicing."" Specificity is everything.
* **Iterate and Drill Down:** The first output is your v1. Now, dig deeper. Ask follow-up questions like:
   * *""Expand on Growth Lever #2. Give me three specific campaign ideas and the resources needed.""*
   * *""For the GTM strategy, write a sample positioning statement.""*
   * *""What are the underlying assumptions you're making in the revenue model?""*
* **Challenge the AI:** Don't accept everything at face value. A great consultant welcomes tough questions. Ask things like:
   * *""What's the biggest risk associated with your recommended pricing strategy?""*
   * *""What's an alternative GTM strategy we could consider and what are its pros and cons?""*

This prompt empowers you to move from ""I think this is a good idea"" to ""We have a data-informed plan."" It democratizes access to the kind of strategic thinking that used to be locked away in expensive boardrooms.

Hope this helps some of you get clarity and build something amazing.

I loved her. So I ran from the city and the memories.Years later, I came back, believing I was free at last.Stacy and Cordell had a child.And me? I was tangled in a scandal with notorious playboy Jackson.Happiness always seemed just out of reach.Until Jackson slipped a ring on my finger.“Elaine, I’ll love you forever.”My family cheered-but Cordell?He pulled me close, his voice dark and possessive: “She’s mine.”Chapter1Elaine Valentine and her sister Stacy Valentine had fallen in love with the same man.Cordell Decker.Now, he was her brother-in-law.When she first heard that her sister, Stacy, was going to marry Cordell, she made a firm decision to leave the country.Her eyes reflected a sense of defeat and despair. ""I'm never coming back, and I won't bless you both.""After leaving for abroad, she cut off all contact with everyone, even avoiding logging into WhatsApp for a long time.That was, until one day when she suddenly called Marcelo Valentine, asking for a large sum of money. That was the first time she'd reached out to her family.As she stepped out of the airport, Rubin Krueger, who had come to pick her up, immediately spotted her. He hurried over and took the suitcase from her hands. ""Ms. Valentine.""She glanced around. Aside from Rubin, there was no one else to greet her. A bitter smile tugged at the corner of her lips.At home, Stacy came forward to greet her. ""Elaine, you've finally come back.""Three years had passed, and Stacy, now married, was even more beautiful than before.She wore a light blue dress, with delicate butterfly embroidery at the collar. The high slit revealed her long, flawless legs.Her hair, once long, had been cut short. The ends curled slightly, dyed a soft chestnut brown, accentuating her fair skin. She looked effortlessly chic and stunning.She descended the stairs slowly, exuding the calm elegance of a wealthy young woman.""Stacy,"" Elaine called softly, her voice lacking the usual softness and coquettish tone.Stacy reached the bottom of the stairs and took in Elaine's appearance, noting how much thinner she had become. She looked almost skeletal.Stacy's heart ached. ""Was life in Drego that tough?""""It wasn't tough. Everything's fine,"" Elaine replied, always sticking to her default answer when asked about Drego-""Fine.""Stacy knew Elaine's stubbornness. If Elaine didn't want to share, asking was pointless.Noticing the fatigue in Elaine's eyes, she suggested, ""Why don't you rest upstairs for a while? After you wake up, I'll have the servants make your favorite dishes.""""Okay,"" Elaine murmured, too tired to argue. She nodded and went upstairs, familiar with the house and making her way to the guest room with ease.After a hot shower, she dried her hair and lay down on the bed, closing her eyes.But her sleep wasn't peaceful. As usual, her dreams were strange and unsettling.When she woke up, the evening had already settled in. She reached for her phone on the nightstand-it was already 9:30 PM.She hadn't eaten much on the plane, and now she was starting to feel hungry.She changed clothes and decided to head downstairs. As she stepped out of the guest room, she glanced down the hallway.Stacy was on the sofa, watching a variety show, while the maid had placed a fruit platter on the coffee table.Just as Elaine took a few steps down, she saw Cordell walking back inside. A servant quickly went to take his shoes and place them at his feet.Her footsteps froze. She gripped the golden handrail tightly, her fingers curling into a fist.Compared to three years ago, he was even more mature and charismatic, wearing a well-tailored dark suit and a white shirt, exuding a cold, clean aura.He was bent over at the entrance, changing his shoes, and hadn't noticed her on the stairs.She hesitated, wondering if she should continue down. She thought it would be awkward for all three of them, and just as she was about to turn back to her room, she heard Stacy's voice calling her name. ""Elaine.""Her body stiffened. She instinctively bit her lip, her nails digging into her palm, the sharp pain spreading through her hand.After a long pause, she turned around, her expression returning to its usual calm, with no hint of emotion.Stacy was sitting on the sofa, looking at her, while Cordell, still at the entrance, had also turned his attention toward her.She glanced at him briefly before subtly shifting her gaze, walking down the stairs. ""Stacy, I'm hungry.""Stacy smiled warmly and called out, ""Janine.""Janine Zavala emerged from the kitchen, and upon seeing Elaine walking down the stairs, she cheerfully greeted her, ""Ms. Valentine.""Before Stacy married Cordell, Elaine used to visit the Decker family frequently, so the household staff all knew her.Elaine had never been haughty, despite being from a wealthy family. She used to call Janine sweetly, and the maid had a good impression of her.Cordell entered the living room, and Stacy effortlessly took his coat, hanging it up in the cloakroom. The way they interacted felt like an old married couple.Elaine couldn't help but feel a sharp pang in her chest, as if a blade was cutting through her heart, leaving a painful, aching tightness.Janine brought out the food prepared for her, and Elaine walked to the dining room. She casually asked, ""Where's Annie?""Annie Ortiz was an old servant of the Decker family who had always been very fond of Elaine. Whenever she visited, Annie would prepare her favorite dishes and fruits.Stacy, noticing the faint smell of alcohol on Cordell, asked the servant to prepare some coffee. Hearing Elaine's question, she replied, ""Annie's grandson is sick, so she took the day off.""Cordell, looking tired, leaned back on the sofa. He glanced over at the dining table, where Elaine sat. Her face had lost its youthful roundness. The white dress she wore made her skin look porcelain-smooth, and her features were sharp and delicate.She had lost a lot of weight, the baby fat completely gone. Her sharp chin made her eyes appear even larger and more striking. They were still as dark and bright as before.Elaine wasn't eating much. She took only a few bites before setting her fork down.Noticing the uneaten food, Janine asked, ""Ms. Valentine, isn't the food to your liking?""It shouldn't be the case, as everything was prepared just as she liked it.Before Elaine could respond, Cordell spoke up, ""You shouldn't eat too much at night.""As soon as he said that, Elaine looked up and met his gaze.Chapter2This was the first time in three years that Elaine looked directly at him, but after just a moment, she quickly averted her gaze.Her eyes, as clear and dark as ever, no longer held the love they once did. Instead, they were calm and indifferent.In that instant, his heart felt empty, and his gaze dimmed.""Elaine, Mom and Dad went to Orevine to pick up Grandpa, so the house is empty. You should stay here for the next few days,"" Stacy said, adopting the tone of a considerate older sister. ""I can take care of you here at the Decker family home. You've been through so much on your own these past years.""Even though Stacy knew about the past between Elaine and Cordell, she still invited her to stay at the Decker family house. If it weren't for Stacy's constant love and care, Elaine might have thought she was trying to make things awkward on purpose.Though Stacy had an excellent reputation in high society-beautiful, graceful, and kind-inviting her husband's ex-girlfriend to stay in their home seemed a little too generous, even for her.Despite being her sister, wouldn't any woman, in the name of protecting her marriage, be more cautious and guarded?A faint, cold smile tugged at the corner of Elaine's lips. ""I've been alone in Drego all these years too.""She had learned to survive in that strange, foreign place. Independence was something she had mastered. Besides, the Valentine family house was still home, and there were servants here.Stacy looked at Elaine's thin face with concern. ""It's been three years since we've seen each other. Don't you want to catch up?""""We'll have plenty of time for that,"" Elaine replied. Given the awkwardness between her and Cordell, there was really no reason to stay under the same roof. ""Stacy, please arrange for a driver to take me back to the Valentine family home.""Cordell put down his coffee, grabbed his coat, and started to head upstairs. After taking a few steps, he paused. ""It's getting late. If you're leaving, maybe it's better to wait until tomorrow.""Elaine glanced at the clock in the living room-it wasn't even 10:30 PM yet, hardly late. But seeing the look of expectation in Stacy's eyes, she hesitated for a moment before replying, ""Alright, I'll stay. Sorry for the trouble.""As she spoke, Cordell, who had been halfway up the stairs, froze. Her polite, distant tone felt like a sharp knife, suddenly and painfully stabbing into his heart.\*\*\*\*\*Having just returned to the country, Elaine was still adjusting to the time difference. She spent the whole night tossing and turning, unable to sleep. When dawn finally broke, she managed to doze off for a short while.She decided to head back to the Valentine family home that day. After waking up, she packed the clothes she'd worn the previous night, tidied up, and then headed downstairs.In the living room, Cordell sat at the dining table in casual loungewear, reading the newspaper. A cup of milk and an untouched sandwich sat in front of him.He looked up briefly, his expression serious as he read. When he heard her footsteps coming downstairs, he glanced over and called out, ""Janine."" The maid immediately set out her breakfast on the table.Elaine walked over and sat down across from him, greeting him casually, ""Good morning.""Cordell paused for a moment, then replied, ""Good morning.""She found it strange. It was almost 8 AM-why was he still sitting here reading the newspaper? Wasn't he supposed to be going to work?Her breakfast was the same as his: a sandwich, a cup of milk, and toast. She took a few bites of the sandwich, finished her milk, and then set down her napkin.""Breakfast is important. You're eating too little,"" Cordell said, closing the newspaper. Her small appetite was honestly surprising.Chapter3""Mr. Decker."" Elaine dismissed his attempt to be considerate with a sharp, sarcastic smile, the corners of her mouth curling up. ""Focus on your own business and stop meddling in matters that have nothing to do with you.""Her simple ""Mr. Decker"" landed like a heavy blow, a hammer crashing into his chest.His face went pale. ""You're calling me Mr. Decker?""She smirked, her tone turning cold and biting. ""What should I call you then?""Cordell's face drained of color. He pressed his lips together, looking momentarily lost in thought. After a long silence, he finally muttered, ""Call me whatever you like.""The atmosphere in the living room grew thick with tension. The servants, sensing the awkwardness between them, stayed far away.""Cordell, Shauna seems to-"" Stacy's anxious voice broke the silence.Stacy entered the room and noticed the strange tension between the two. She looked confused and asked, ""Elaine, you're up?""Elaine turned to glance at the entrance. It was hard to ignore how well Stacy looked in her dress-her graceful features and tall, slender figure gave her the air of a woman from the early 20th century. She stood there effortlessly, exuding a refined, aristocratic charm.But then, Elaine's gaze locked on something and her face went pale.In Stacy's arms was a baby, dressed in pink, with tiny, chubby hands clutching her dress.Stacy noticed where Elaine was looking and softly said, ""Elaine, this is Shauna Decker. She's just over a year old.""If three years ago, when Cordell and Stacy married, her world had crumbled, then at this moment, it felt as though it had turned barren.She clutched the edge of the table, doing everything she could to hide her shock and force herself to stay calm.She should have seen it coming. They had been married for three years. Of course, they would have a child by now.She remembered the days when they used to lie together, dreaming about the future. On the lawn behind the Decker family garden, she would lie in his arms, playing with his long, fair fingers.""Cordell, what do you want to do after you graduate from college?""He thought for a moment, then answered seriously, ""Work hard to make money, and then marry you.""When he said that, her eyes, sparkling like stars, lit up with excitement. ""Then what?""""Then you'll do your duty as my wife and give me a child. A daughter, ideally-one just like you, sweet and adorable. I'll spoil both of you.""His tone was casual, but his gaze was intense and sincere.Her heart soared with happiness, though she pretended to be coy, blushing as she playfully pinched his arm. ""You're impossible.""Back then, she could think of nothing else but marrying Cordell after graduation.""Then you'll need to think of a name for our daughter.""""Let's call her Shauna.""She wrinkled her nose in distaste. ""That's too ordinary. You're a top student at Hillcrest Academy, and you give your daughter such a lazy name? She'll probably disown you when she grows up.""""But you and she will be my only ones."" He wasn't good with sweet talk, and after saying that, his ears turned red.She hugged him tightly in excitement and kissed his cheek. ""Alright, but we agreed-the name Shauna will only be her nickname. You'll have to come up with a real name later, or else I'm worried she'll resent us when she grows up.""Elaine smiled softly, her eyes clouded with a thin layer of mist. She forced herself to hold back the emotions, almost as if she were mocking herself, murmuring softly, ""I'm an aunt now. That's fine.""Chapter4Elaine walked over to Stacy, her gaze falling on the child in her arms.Shauna's skin was as smooth and white as porcelain, like a little doll. Her chubby cheeks were a soft pink, and her big, round eyes were as dark and shiny as marbles, making her irresistibly cute.A mist seemed to form in Elaine's eyes as she reached out and gently touched the baby's soft cheek. It felt as smooth as a freshly peeled egg, soft and tender under her fingertips.This was his daughter, Shauna.She paused for a moment, then gave a bitter smile.He had a wife. He had a child. His daughter was named Shauna-the name that matched the daughter they had once imagined having together.Stacy noticed Elaine's discomfort, but with everything happening, she couldn't focus on it. Her voice became urgent. ""Cordell, Shauna has diarrhea.""Cordell immediately stood up, walking quickly toward them. He glanced at the baby in Stacy's arms before grabbing the car keys from the coffee table. ""We're going to the hospital.""Elaine instinctively took a step forward to follow, but then stopped after just a couple of steps.In his arms was his wife. His wife was holding their child. What was she supposed to do?Watching them leave, Elaine bit her lip, clenching her hands by her sides. A faint, metallic taste lingered in her mouth.\*\*\*\*\*The Silver Oak Grand Hotel was the largest in Aleshire, grand and opulent. The corridors were lined with deep purple, embroidered carpets, and the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling looked like a blooming white flowers, beautiful and sparkling.With a soft chime, the elevator doors opened, and Elaine stepped out.She wore a white dress with beige high heels. Her face was calm and pale, with a quiet elegance, and her tall, slender figure stood out as she walked.She made her way straight to the presidential suite. Before arriving, she had learned that Jackson Mason had a long-term suite here at the Silver Oak Grand Hotel, one he used for his affairs.To put it simply, ""affairs"" meant a lot more than casual meetings.As she raised her hand to knock on the door, it suddenly swung open from the inside. A woman, crying and hiding her face, rushed past her, disheveled, clutching her purse tightly as she left in a hurry.Jackson changed lovers every three months. He had just broken up with his last one a few days ago, so this woman... had her attempts to seduce him failed?Elaine pushed the half-open door the rest of the way open and stepped inside. Her heart skipped a beat with nervousness as she scanned the room. It was empty, except for the sound of water running from the bathroom.She tossed her handbag onto the couch and waited. After a moment, the bathroom door opened.She turned her head at the sound, and her gaze fell on the man's strong, sculpted body. His handsome face was slightly flushed from the steam, and his wet, black hair clung to his forehead, with droplets of water glistening on his skin.His chest, a smooth honey-tan, was flat and toned, and as the water from his hair dripped onto his chest, it followed a path down his body, slipping under the towel wrapped loosely around his waist.This man-he was even more strikingly handsome than any celebrity.When Jackson saw someone unexpectedly standing in the room, his brows furrowed in irritation. ""Get out.""Elaine's cheeks flushed slightly. She cleared her throat to hide her embarrassment.He was simply too good-looking.It felt as if God had been extra kind to him when creating him.Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself and then stated, ""Mr. Mason, I'm here to apply for the position of your next lover.""Chapter5Elaine was naturally shy, and saying something like that was difficult for her.Once she spoke, her delicate face turned a soft pink, glowing under the light, her skin vibrant and radiant.Her skin was flawless-smooth and pale like jewel. Her cheeks were soft and rosy, almost baby-like, so tender that they seemed to invite a gentle touch. Her beauty was pure but also had a subtle charm.Jackson narrowed his eyes, looking her over slowly. His thin lips curled into a sarcastic smile. ""Not every woman who comes knocking gets what she wants.""Elaine blushed with both embarrassment and frustration. The flush on her fair skin made her look even more captivating and radiant, while her clear eyes shone brightly.She bit her lip and, gathering courage, moved closer to him, wrapping her arms around his waist-but not pressing her body against his.She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze. ""So, what do you think of me?""""Need money?"" His eyes twinkled with amusement as he glanced at her arms wrapped around him, as delicate as lotus stems.""You're handsome. Being with you wouldn't be a loss,"" she said, flashing a smile. The chandelier overhead sparkled in her dark eyes.Jackson scoffed. ""Is that all?""She paused, thinking for a moment, then shook her head. ""That's it.""He'd met plenty of women like her before, but none had been this blunt.He couldn't help but look at her a little longer.After a long silence, as he still hadn't spoken, Elaine raised her gaze to meet his deep, unreadable eyes. Slowly, her eyes traveled down his face until they landed on his thin, sculpted lips.Standing on tiptoe, she leaned in. Just as her lips were about to brush against his, Jackson pulled away.His voice was cold and detached. ""Go take a shower first.""""Okay."" She responded quietly, heading to the bathroom, turning on the water, and standing under the shower, her heart pounding loudly.For a brief moment, she regretted acting so impulsively. She stayed in the bathroom, hesitating for a while, before putting on a bathrobe. Taking a deep breath, she finally opened the bathroom door.Jackson was leaning against the headboard, watching as she stepped out. The steam from the shower left a soft pink glow on her face, and the bathrobe was loosely tied, exposing her delicate collarbone, her skin flawless and smooth.Elaine tugged at the bathrobe, which was clearly too big for her. It was Jackson's, and it hung loosely, almost to her ankles, looking slightly comical.Seeing her awkwardly clutching the robe, Jackson frowned slightly. ""If you regret it, you can leave now.""Elaine hesitated, then bit her lower lip, moving closer and slowly untying the bathrobe.Though she was slender, her figure was well-proportioned, and her skin glowed like fine porcelain, smooth and radiant under the light.She bent down to kiss him, but her inexperience showed in her tentative, unsure movements. Jackson turned his head slightly, avoiding her. ""No experience?""Her face instantly flushed, and she wished she could bury her head in the pillow. She barely whispered, ""No.""Jackson's gaze flickered to her flushed cheeks, and he noticed her long, dark lashes trembling slightly, revealing her nervousness and uncertainty.He wasn't someone who believed in being morally perfect, so he didn't expect others to be either. But seeing her so shy and flustered made him pause for a moment.Elaine lowered her eyes, waiting for him to react. After a long silence, feeling embarrassed, she almost wanted to pull back entirely.She tried to move away from him, but in the next moment, he grabbed the back of her head, pulling her face down, flipping them over in one smooth motion.Everything seemed to spin, and Elaine, panicked, clung to his neck, her eyes wide with a momentary sense of confusion.As they switched positions, she found herself staring up at his handsome face, her breath catching in her throat.Chapter6The light from above cast a shadow across Jackson's handsome face as he fixed his gaze on her. ""What's your name?"" he asked.Elaine's face turned slightly pale, and she answered slowly, each word measured. ""Elaine.""""Have you thought this through? It's not too late to change your mind."" Jackson gave her one final chance.Uncomfortable, Elaine shifted slightly. Jackson's expression darkened as he growled, ""Don't move!""Startled, Elaine froze, her eyes locked on him. Her body became stiff and tense.She was so nervous that her breath came in short, uneven bursts, causing her to speak a little more quickly than usual. ""I've thought about it carefully. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.""She had been mulling it over for days before making the decision.On her way here, she had almost reconsidered for a moment, but...At that thought, a self-deprecating smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, and her eyes dimmed with a touch of sadness.Jackson noticed the shift in her expression, sensing the faint sorrow on her face. His heart stirred slightly. ""How much do you need?""Elaine blinked in confusion. ""What?""Jackson furrowed his brow, his tone cool. ""How much money do you need?""She stared at him, slightly stunned. His jawline was sharp and perfectly defined, and for a moment, she lost herself in the details of his face before quickly snapping out of it. With a soft smile, she responded, ""You can decide.""Jackson raised an eyebrow, a hint of irritation in his expression.She smiled again, her voice soft. ""Mr. Mason isn't the type to be stingy, so I'm not worried you'll give me too little.""She had once thought that when she turned twenty, she would give the most precious thing she had to Cordell, the man she had loved for so long.Jackson studied her for a moment, then leaned down to kiss her.\*\*\*\*\*Afterward, Jackson pulled away and got up to head into the bathroom.Elaine grabbed the blanket and pulled it around her, her gaze vacant as she stared at the ceiling. The crystal chandelier above cast a bright light, making her face look as pale as paper.The sound of running water from the bathroom was loud in the quiet room.A short while later, Jackson emerged from the bathroom and entered the walk-in closet. When he came back out, he was dressed, sharp and impeccably put together.The deep blue shirt fit him perfectly, and his trousers highlighted his long, lean legs. His features were sharp, almost sculpted, and his dark eyes were especially striking under the light.Elaine had gathered herself by then. Apart from her slightly red eyes, she seemed composed.Jackson pulled out a pen and paper, writing a check and placing it on the nightstand. His eyes were void of emotion.""Leave your contact information when you leave. I'll call you if I need anything.""He picked up his custom-made watch from the table and strapped it on, then walked toward the door. After taking a few steps, he stopped, not turning around. His voice was flat and distant.""You should have done your homework before coming. Do you know what the rules are?""She answered softly, ""I know.""Jackson's women were only meant to last for three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be available whenever he called. They couldn't visit him at his company or cause any trouble. After three months, they were to part ways without further contact.Chapter7Jackson's women had a shelf life of three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be at his beck and call. They weren't allowed to visit him at his company or cause trouble. Once the three months were up, they were expected to leave and not look back.Rumor had it that Jackson was cold and indifferent by nature, yet women still flocked to him, eager to get into his bed.Not only was he rich and powerful, but he also treated women generously. After the three months were over, they were sent off with a generous severance package.Jackson didn't linger. He opened the door and left.Elaine picked up the check from the bedside table, staring at the figure written on it. A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips. 170 thousand dollars...Because Cordell didn't need her, she had given the most precious thing she had to a stranger.This man, in both looks and background, was no less impressive than Cordell, so she wasn't losing out, right?Then why did it hurt so much? The kind of pain that came from being discarded but still unwilling to let go.A cold tear slid down her cheek, and she bit her wrist, trying to stop herself from crying.\*\*\*\*\*The Valentine family estate had been passed down through generations. It was a grand, old house that resembled a castle, with ivy crawling up the red brick walls, the green vines bright and striking in the sunlight.Tall, sturdy sycamore trees lined the yard, the flowerbeds were neat and beautiful, and the fountain sparkled like a goddess scattering flowers. In the summer, walking along the shady paths beneath the trees was cool and refreshing.Elaine had a lounge chair set up by the flowerbed on the lawn. She sat quietly, reading a book, with a cup of coffee resting on the small glass table beside her. It was a scene of perfect peace, like stealing a few moments of blissful calm.Olivia hurried over, her voice filled with excitement. ""Ms. Valentine, your father and grandfather are back.""""I know,"" Elaine replied, closing her book. She composed herself and walked back to the living room.In the living room, an elderly man in his sixties sat on the sofa, dressed in a traditional suit. He held a finely carved cane and wore a ring on his thumb, his graying hair perfectly groomed.Beside him sat a couple who looked weary from travel. The man wore a suit, and the woman wore a deep purple dress, draped with a beige shawl. They exuded an air of wealth and elegance.Elaine changed her shoes at the entrance and walked into the living room. ""Grandfather, Dad, Mom.""Marcelo gave a brief nod. In contrast to his indifference, Constance Valentine eagerly stepped forward, gently touching Elaine's thin face, her eyes glistening with tears. ""Elaine, you've lost weight.""Elaine opened her mouth, about to respond, but just then, a cold snort echoed through the quiet room.She turned her gaze toward the sound, meeting the stern eyes of her grandfather Abraham Valentine, who glared at her. ""So, you finally decided to come back?""She pressed her lips together and remained silent.Abraham had never liked her.After Constance lost a lot of blood during her birth and couldn't have more children, the male line of the Valentine family was cut off with Marcelo.The Valentine family had vast wealth, and someone had to inherit it. Abraham had suggested that Marcelo take a mistress, have a son, and bring him into the family, paying the woman off and sending her away from Aleshire.Marcelo and Constance had been high school classmates, and their relationship had been solid ever since. They started dating in college and had been happily married for many years.Marcelo had firmly rejected Abraham's proposal, and the two often argued about it, to the point that Abraham once became so angry he had to be hospitalized.Chapter8Because of this, Marcelo had always been more affectionate toward Stacy than Elaine, treating her with indifference.Moreover, since Abraham never liked her, Elaine was sent to live with her grandmother of the maternal line in Prarc Town when she was young. She stayed there until her grandmother passed away when she was thirteen, at which point she was brought back to the Valentine family.Elaine stood stiffly, and Constance quickly stepped in to help. ""Dad, Elaine came back specifically for your 80th birthday, which is in two weeks. She wanted to wish you well."" She then shot Elaine a pointed look.Elaine pretended not to notice and stayed silent. If it hadn't been for Constance's repeated insistence, she wouldn't have returned for such an insignificant birthday celebration.In the Valentine family, only Constance and Stacy treated her with any kindness. However, ever since Stacy married Cordell, there had been a distance between them.To be fair, it was a distance that only she felt.Stacy still treated her with the same care-checking on her when she was sick, asking about her daily well-being.Elaine had struggled with this for a long time, which led her to deliberately distance herself from Stacy, and as a result, their relationship was no longer as close as it once had been.Marcelo didn't want her return to disrupt the family's peace, so he joined in with Constance, saying, ""Dad, Elaine called me a few days ago to ask what kind of gift you'd like. She's really put a lot of thought into choosing something special for you.""If it hadn't been for Marcelo's reminder, Elaine would have completely forgotten about preparing a gift. Thankfully, she still had two weeks, plenty of time to find something fitting for Abraham.When Marcelo said this, Abraham held back his anger, though his face remained stern.Elaine didn't mind, though. In her memories, Abraham had always been like this-stern and unapproachable.The only time he had been genuinely warm was when she was sixteen. She had scored first in the entire school and was accepted into a prestigious high school. That same year, Stacy had used the family's connections to get into the same school.Just then, the phone in the living room rang. Constance, who was standing next to it, picked up the receiver.After a brief conversation, she smiled brightly. ""Okay, got it.""She hung up the phone and turned to Abraham. ""Dad, Stacy and Cordell know you're back today. They've made a reservation at a restaurant to welcome you.""Abraham's expression softened slightly. ""Stacy is such a thoughtful child.""Before long, Stacy and Cordell arrived at the Valentine family home to pick everyone up for dinner.As soon as Stacy entered the living room, she walked over and hugged Abraham's arm before sitting beside him. Her delicate makeup only made her appear even more graceful and lovely.""Grandpa, I've missed you so much these days. How was your time in Orevine?""Abraham clearly appreciated her affection. A rare smile appeared on his usually stern face. ""I'm well. Everything is fine. But why didn't you bring Shauna?""Stacy smiled brightly. ""We're going out later, so it's not convenient to bring her along.""In the evening, the group went to the restaurant, where the waiter led them to a private dining room.Stacy sat to Abraham's right, and throughout the meal, she kept the conversation lively with amusing stories that made him laugh heartily.Abraham shared stories about Orevine's customs and scenery, and everyone listened attentively.The conversation flowed smoothly, but Elaine sat quietly, feeling out of place at the family gathering.She felt suffocated, like an outsider, and eventually excused herself, saying she needed to use the bathroom, before quietly slipping away from the table.Chapter9As Elaine opened the door to the private room, she found herself face to face with someone exiting the opposite room. Their eyes met, and they both paused for a moment.Out of politeness, she was about to greet him with a ""Mr. Mason,"" but the words got stuck in her throat.Jackson gave her a brief glance, walking past her as if she were a stranger, his eyes not lingering for even a second.Watching his tall, straight figure retreat, she awkwardly rubbed her nose. Noticing he was headed toward the restroom, she decided against going herself.She walked down the hallway to the end, lingering in a quiet corner near the stairs, where she distracted herself with her phone. When she saw it was nearly time, she tucked her phone away and made her way back to the private room.As she neared the room, she saw Cordell standing in the hallway just outside.He wore a V-neck shirt and brown casual trousers.Just like years ago, his style was simple and relaxed, but it made him look effortlessly handsome.A cigarette hung between his fingers, and the smoke curled lazily around him. The light from the crystal chandelier above made his striking features look even more defined.When he saw her return, he took a long drag from his cigarette, extinguished it, and tossed it into the nearby trash can. He shot her a quiet glance before pushing open the door and stepping inside.Given the sensitive nature of their current relationship, it would have been too obvious if they had entered together, so she waited outside for a moment before finally entering.At the dinner table, Constance noticed Elaine's slight frame and was overly attentive, constantly serving her more food. Elaine's appetite was small, but not wanting to disappoint Constance, she forced herself to finish what was on her plate, feeling stuffed and uncomfortable.After dinner, they all left the private room.At the same time, a group of sharply dressed men emerged from the opposite room.At the head of the group was a man who exuded charm, with an exceptional presence.Marcelo stepped forward and extended his hand to greet him. ""Mr. Mason, long time no see.""Jackson took his hand with a polite but somewhat distant smile.His gaze briefly swept over the people standing behind Marcelo. ""Mr. Valentine, is this a family gathering?""Jackson's heart skipped a beat. 'So, this woman is the daughter of the Valentine family?'Marcelo, ever the gracious host, responded, ""Yes, we're welcoming my father home.""Jackson's eyes flicked over Elaine and landed on Abraham, who was standing beside Stacy.Though they hadn't met before, Jackson, raised with good manners, offered a polite greeting. ""Good evening, Mr. Valentine.""It was just a brief glance, but for a fleeting moment, Elaine felt a sharp chill in his gaze.'What did I do to upset him?' she wondered.Abraham, hearing Marcelo call Jackson ""Mr. Mason,"" quickly deduced that the man before them was the renowned head of the Mason family.Having been involved in business in his younger days, Abraham had some old connections with Jackson's grandfather. He smiled, though his face remained deeply lined with age.""The last time I saw you, you were just six years old. You've grown up so much since then.""The attempt at small talk was awkward and forced.Jackson raised an eyebrow, offering a polite smile but saying nothing. The crystal lighting in the hallway highlighted his sharp, handsome features, making him look even more striking.Cordell stepped forward to greet him, extending his hand. He briefly scanned the people behind Jackson, recognizing some of them as executives from various companies. ""Mr. Mason, are you here to discuss a project?""Jackson gave a slight nod, his dark eyes reflecting the lights, adding a touch of mystery.The men with Jackson exchanged pleasantries and handshakes with Cordell, the entire interaction formal and courteous.Once the greetings were done, the two groups filed out of the restaurant, one after the other.",1,1755724586.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

these people are unethical and do not deserve your money. go to alias, or mojos, literally anywhere else.
i would like to say that i am a former stacks employee. let me clarify what is currently happening. 
1. a previous employee is suing the company! as they should. this employee had just bought a new house and was super excited that she would be able to afford it. because she was a lead barista. she, and everyone else got demoted. they say it was to “start fresh”. everyone was to now make $15, even though EVERYONE was making $17+ originally. i hope that this employee gets everything she deserves!
2.  the owner sue did in fact put a used toilet plunger in the ice machine that we use constantly. she thought that sanitizing it was enough. THAT PLUNGER TOUCHED LITERAL SHIT!!! it is not clean regardless of how much you sanitize it. 
> let me also add that sue in the CEO of having victim complex as well. she is always saying, “poor me, why me?”.
> sue also periodically goes in trips to europe, but acts like she cant pay her employees better wages
> the other owner tyler doesnt do shit. he walks into the shop gets coffee and does nothing else. literally useless. 
3. an employee did get fired because of sues plunger situation. this employee went to tyler (the other owner) and directly messaged him about what sue had done, bc she was concerned. tyler went to sue. sue being herself (victim) fired this employee for speaking behind her back. EVEN THOUGH THE EMPLOYEE FIRST SPOKE TO SUE AND SUE DISMISSED HER
4. also you could literally kill yourself before your shift and the manager kylie will go to your funeral say that it is unacceptable
5. my coworker was at work absolutely coked out of her mind and they acted like it wasnt an issue. THATS CRAZYYY. she had white powder on her nostril and was genuinely tweaking. nothing was done about this. she had to finish the shift, like everyone else. 
to be frank nothing about stacks is normal. this place should be shut down. nothing they do is ethical and i a have genuinely never been so excited to leave a work place. do not waste your hard earned money on this place. i promise you not a single soul at stacks likes there job. everyone there sucks. 
>tyler is usless 
>sue is a goddess of victimhood
>kylie (the manger) will overshare on the owners and employees. 
>chloe ur a vibe, do not let that place suck the life out of you. touchy coffee is hiring!

1mvrl8e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvrl8e,"SP is obsessively watching me for months, yet still NC","**TL;DR he's still just passively watching me, I deleted everything & not gonna post stories for at least a month, to starve him out of whatever he's been getting out of this. I need advice for best manifestation approach to meet irl & have loving reconnection. 3 months NC, haven't seen eachother since Christmas, idk what to do besides move on in my life, as both intentional manifestation & detachment didn't produce results, besides orbiting**

This is a continuation to the saga when I crashed out several months ago about my SP who has been ""orbiting"" me for months yet no progress being made, outside of whatever fantasy is happening in his mind. It's like the avoidant theory of how they like to yearn for you from afar, fawn over your memory, yet can't bring themselves to cross that bridge back into irl connection with you. I don't think I manifested him being avoidant, I'm just organically reacting/trying to make sense of the situation.

I'm not even going to go back into the back story. What I did though was in May I got sick of him flaking on plans, even though I felt like it was out of fear of the intensity of our connection. I deleted him from all socials for just under 2 months. When I did that, I noticed he didn't log on for a solid month, there's a possibility me doing this crushed him.

In early July, I added him back on Snapchat. I noticed within a day of sending my ""can we start over/I'm sorry for overreacting"" dm, he magically logged on I guess to half-swipe it (so he can read it without it showing as Opened).

He ignored the message. I also did something unhinged & deleted EVERYONE off there except for him, and my privacy settings are all set to you must know my username to see my profile. So I know the obsessive viewing is him, the other followers are my alt accounts. I personally think it's super creepy to view someone's stories etc while having their dm on delivered.

I did an experiment... how long will this man silently watch me? I just posted cute soft thirst traps & little clips romanticizing my daily life, I noticed the ones with my voice had long view times. All the profile views, I'm guessing tracking my snap score. One thing is for sure.. this man really, REALLY likes what he sees.

After he watched 2 of my private stories in a row, I sent 1 more followup short dm on August 1st, saying it doesn't have to be like this & it would be so nice to just catch up over coffee like nothing happened.

Watching my stuff really picked up that week after I sent that. I even posted a clip about how being left on delivered makes me feel, it's a special type of cold cruelty to do to someone you've previously been so loving with.

But as of last week, I accepted that all this ""experiment"" has proven was that I'm essentially being his fantasy free onlyfans girl, and no, it did not trigger his desire to escalate to the point where he wants me irl. Personally, if I liked what I see that much to be stalking the object of my desire, I would absolutely wanna be skin to skin & viewing them day after day thru the screen would be like torture.

I deleted everything. I'm starving him of whatever it was that he was getting out of this. I do think this could be a 2 month ""punishment"" he is doing back to me, since I deleted him for 2 months. But this is not what I want, I just want to reconnect and move past it. I don't want to play game of thrones. I wanna just reconcile like mature non-disordered adults.

I haven't done any manifestation techniques since April, all I do now is focus on sending love and forgiveness, and trying to telepathically communicate that I miss our connection and I'm here when his life gets better, or whatever has been going on.

One thing that did happen though, a man I really didn't like at all tried to come back, and pursue me hard, after nearly 5 months no contact, previously we didn't end on good terms, yet that didn't stop him.

At this point, besides the dumb experiment, what I've been doing is not letting myself think about him at all and focusing on my own life, and when he crosses my mind (still everyday, sadly) I send love and tell him ""get in touch with me when you are ready"".. perhaps this is an extended timeline, perhaps it's not a good time at all in his life.. but how cruel to not even read my words, wouldn't a mature respectful adult at least respond, and communicate even a brief "" sorry but I can't do this"" statement?

I do know that I'm never initiating contact with him ever again, even if he watches every story I ever post.

I stopped doing manifestation techniques because I never saw any progress besides the above, regardless if I detached or lived in the wish fulfilled daily. That is when I said I'm just going to do Hoʻoponopono and release him from my thoughts, as I no longer know what to do.

Since it has been so long & I've already applied various ways.. what approach do you recommend?",3,1755724506.0,lawofassumption,4,0.8,False

I was gifted some money to spend on a BAB. I was going to get pumpkin kitty, but I’ve changed my mind - I’m torn between watermelon frog, the platypus, and the bipedal cuddly cow. 

The issue: I want to add a coffee scent, I’ve heard everyone loves it. I also would like to stuff my cow myself (at the workshop). But I’m not able to buy the scent separately from the unstuffed bear. But w h y. The only way I can add it is by customizing the bear I selected. When I select customize, it forces me to have the bear pre-stuffed. If I try to add just the scent to my cart, it takes me to the bear builder screen. Why can’t I order them unstuffed AND with a scent? Is this just a thing? I could swear I’ve seen other posts of people ordering their stuff separately and with an unstuffed bear. I can’t change the stuffing option once I’m at the cart. Maybe I’m just bad at using their site on mobile??

Your opinions: who should I get? I’m worried that my watermelon frog is going to come looking sad but I would really prefer if he were happy! I think I’m leaning towards cow. But I started collecting the frogs… Should I get someone else entirely? Change my mind!

^OR, should I wait until I go in-store next instead? I don’t have any coupons right now and want to get the most bang for my buck, but the last time I was in there wasn’t anything I was too crazy about.

And now I have a reddit username and a place where I can experiment with it. So, I asked ChatGPT to give me a trite question and I have put it upon myself to try to write a somewhat interesting response. Here we go for Q1.

I prefer tea. Never liked coffee.  
For my first working experience (I was 15) I worked parttime as a cashier in a supermarket, the Edah. I loved it, it was nice chatting to the customers and I was good at it. I did it for 10 years, as an after-school job. This is where I first realised I really don't like coffee. The smell, the taste, to me it was abhorrent. For 10 years my colleagues asked me during our breaks ""coffee?"" and I would always decline, eventually adding ""have you ever seen me drinking coffee??"". It became a running gag.  
I saw grown ups drinking litres of the black bitter stuff and I could not wrap my head around how people could love the taste of something so foul.  
Over the years (I'm 45 now) friends and family have told me they need coffee to wake up. I'm baffled at the idea. Sure, it would be great to have a clear head after waking up (I am notoriously groggy in the morning), but the caffeine does not do it for me. Even the small amount of caffeine in a can of Coke will make me jittery and flying into walls. I've been told it's the same feeling most people get from drinking some cans of energy drink. I will definitely not be drinking that then, nor will I research the effect the caffeine in a cup of coffee will have on me.  
So, even though most people I know need coffee on a daily basis, this addiction has never gotten its claws in me. I doubt it will ever. But then again, as a Dutchie I also hated cheese, oh how things change...",1,1755724315.0,u_AzureWisp80,0,0.99,False

these people are unethical and do not deserve your money. go to alias, or mojos, literally anywhere else.
i would like to say that i am a former stacks employee. let me clarify what is currently happening. 
1. a previous employee is suing the company! as they should. this employee had just bought a new house and was super excited that she would be able to afford it. because she was a lead barista. she, and everyone else got demoted. they say it was to “start fresh”. everyone was to now make $15, even though EVERYONE was making $17+ originally. i hope that this employee gets everything she deserves!
2.  the owner sue did in fact put a used toilet plunger in the ice machine that we use constantly. she thought that sanitizing it was enough. THAT PLUNGER TOUCHED LITERAL SHIT!!! it is not clean regardless of how much you sanitize it. 
> let me also add that sue in the CEO of having victim complex as well. she is always saying, “poor me, why me?”.
> sue also periodically goes in trips to europe, but acts like she cant pay her employees better wages
> the other owner tyler doesnt do shit. he walks into the shop gets coffee and does nothing else. literally useless. 
3. an employee did get fired because of sues plunger situation. this employee went to tyler (the other owner) and directly messaged him about what sue had done, bc she was concerned. tyler went to sue. sue being herself (victim) fired this employee for speaking behind her back. EVEN THOUGH THE EMPLOYEE FIRST SPOKE TO SUE AND SUE DISMISSED HER
4. also you could literally kill yourself before your shift and the manager kylie will go to your funeral say that it is unacceptable
5. my coworker was at work absolutely coked out of her mind and they acted like it wasnt an issue. THATS CRAZYYY. she had white powder on her nostril and was genuinely tweaking. nothing was done about this. she had to finish the shift, like everyone else. 
to be frank nothing about stacks is normal. this place should be shut down. nothing they do is ethical and i a have genuinely never been so excited to leave a work place. do not waste your hard earned money on this place. i promise you not a single soul at stacks likes there job. everyone there sucks.

I really dove into roasting on it earlier this year and am ready to upgrade our roaster. I'm noticing we can't get great roasts on some of our favorite coffee beans, notably those from Ethiopia and Kenya. We used to brew exclusively French press, but lately we've been doing batch brew on the Fellow Aiden, with occassional Chemex/v60/French press on the weekends. We go through about 500g of roasted coffee per week. Given all that, I've had a really tough time deciding on our next roaster. The top contenders so far are: 

* Kaffelogic Nano 7 with boost - But I worry about the beans having enough body to stand up to our mostly daily batch brews. 
* Kaleido M2/M6 - An obvious upgrade from the Gene Cafe, but is it significant enough?
* Aillio Bullet R2 - Seems to be the best, but also FAR more expensive. I don't need the larger capacity, so is the roasted product worth the price jump?

I'd love to hear any input on these roasters, especially when it comes to brewing those African fruit bombs, as I've got some potentially great green beans from all over the world just waiting to be roasted.

***He felt naked.. Without the yellow rabbit costume now..***



***Just when William was about to calm the situation down he heard it. The police walked into the building and they pivoted their gaze to William. Fear gripped William but he kept calm in the name of his pride. William  was arrested that day..*** 



***“William Afton you have the right to remain silent anything you say will be used agains’t you in a court of law. You have the right to call a lawyer.” The policeman said while placing handcuffs on the towering William and he was led to the police vehicle.***

  
  
  


***He heard murmurs and whispers behind him***

  
  


***His thoughts were racing.. Then here it came the fear that lingered with him. The crippling fear of his own mortality.. He had feared death all his life.. That he will be forgotten. But he remained calm in his composure.***

***He heard the voices they were distant and muted.. He had been present for each abduction. The police department knew what he did.***



***The hours went by like a blur. William watched the footage of his arrest on the TV mounted in the corner. Coffee sat untouched conversations frozen mid sentence.*** 

  
  


***William was always a student of theatrics he was quite confident he would talk his way out of this. But there was fear that someone will find out about what he did.. That his Wife and son Michael will tell the world the real him..***



***William watched footage of peoples thoughts on him or the facade he constructed “That’s got to be a mistake..” He recognized her as Linda his neighbour and mother of three “He’s William the nice and outgoing one.. Always gives the kids extra tokens and makes them laugh. Asking about my husband he wouldn’t hurt a fly.”***



***William gave a sly smile.***



***Then they interviewed another person Mr Chambers who never liked the Pizzeria on the TV “Too Charming.. Too likeable always thought there was something off about that William Guy like he was trying too hard.”***



***The TV reporter continued “While suspect has been charged the bodies were never found. William Afton Innocent or CrImInAl?”***

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


***It was as if fire was spreading all around William. His lies finally catching up to him. William had always fancied himself a thespian at heart retreating into his characters and theatricality.***



***He craved the Yellow Rabbit costume now he felt naked without it. He knows the feeling of the fur of the suit. How wet and sticky it was as if the costume  itself were sweating.***

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


***The room smelled faintly of Coffee and the smoke of cigarette entered in Williams nose. William was sitting in a chair too small for him.***



***A detective approached William. “Mr Afton. You know why you’re here?”***



***William smiled warm and easy “Ofcourse detective you’ve made that pretty clear I just wish you’d let me bring my own coffee you’res is dreadful.” he chuckled softly as if this were a joke between friends.***



***The detective pulled out a photo of a man in a yellow rabbit mascot costume leading kids into a backroom “Recognize this.”***



***William gave the detective a measured look he leaned forward peering at the images with interest. “Well that’s one of our mascots isn’t it? Springbonnie..” he said the name as if it were his child.***



***“Henry and I made him.” he said a hint of resentment and eviousness in his voice “Though that’s a terrible picture terribly blurry if I do say so myself could be anyone.”***



***The detectives jaw tightened “We have three people who placed you in that suit that night and two more who saw you leave the side door after closing.”***



***William gave a sympathetic frown the kind you’d  give to someone as if they lost a bet “Ah eye witnesses well.. People see what they expect to see dont they? Im a very recognizable fella. Big smile. Big presence easy to mistake me for someone else in the excitement of a birthday party..”***

  
  
  


***The detective slid a photo across the table this one of the children smiling at the camera. “They trusted you Mr  Afton.. Their parents they trusted you.”***



***William exhaled slowly “Detective do you really think I’d do such a thing? I’ve spent my entire life bringing fantasy and fun to life to children did you really think I could really?” he trailed off letting the question hang in the air.***



***“This isn’t a salespitch Mr Afton this is murder.”***



***“Well I suppose you’d better have enough to convince the jury in this special occasion.”***



***He leaned back again calm as ever. As if the interrogation was just a sales meeting and one which he intended to win with theatrics. He wasn’t going to steal anyone their happiest day.. He wasn’t going to let anyone steal his dream of bringing fantasy and fun to life.***



***The detective grew impatient “We know that you did it so why don’t you confess?.”***



***William was completely calm he wasn’t an idiot he thought to himself.***



***“You’ve been present at each abduction. Each child was missing.”***



***“I won’t talk to you till I have my phone call.” William said calmly and with a measured look on his eye. Even though fear gripped him he wasn’t going to wound his pride in caving in he wasn’t going to look like an idiot.*** 



***The detective left frustrated.*** 



***He wanted to love like Henry.. He tried to love.. But he couldn't. they both wanted to love. Henry loved and now he has loved when he thought back to the animatronics at the Pizzeria. His family..***



***He helped Henry create.***



***William remembered his youth. Growing up with tiny scraps of power feeling more and more abused by family who did not appreciate him. By neighbours who slighted him in imperceptible ways that made him lack something essential.***



***And now he has created.. He created his own world. All his secret’s he’ll take with him and no one will ever know. They will reign supreme this is what he dreams.***

***Hear the children sing aloud***

***It’s music til the wick burns out.***

1mvrcfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mvrcfs/settling_into_a_routine/,Settling into a Routine,"Elijah stepped out of his cabin, breathing in the crisp morning air. The woods were quiet; the only sound was the rustling of leaves under his feet- he made a mental note to sweep the porch off later. This was his favorite time of day, before the world woke up and the noise began. He didn’t own an alarm clock, but his body always woke him up right at sunrise.

Several years ago, he had chosen to move away from the city- to keep to himself and protect his peace. Leaving behind his hometown and his crazy ex-wife was a giant burden lifted off his shoulders. He had used his savings to secure a humble cabin- he used his hunting and fishing skills to feed himself. Seldom he would load his rusty pickup full of chopped firewood, drive an hour to the nearest town and sell it for extra cash for any necessities he needed. It was a simple life, but it was his- and he was happy.

He walked to the edge of his porch, where a small wooden table held a bowl of scraps. Elijah had grown into the habit of feeding the wildlife that wandered onto his property. He often hunted for his own food and enjoyed giving it back to nature. He poured the remains of last night’s meal into the metal bowl and returned to the porch to sit in his rocking chair. A small squirrel wandered down from a tree, curiously inspecting the bowl. Elijah watched- this was his morning ritual- one that he looked forward to. Before the divorce, Elijah would never have believed he would find his peace alone watching the little critters eat- it was corny- but it was his truth.

Just as he was about to head back inside, he noticed a shape trotting among the trees. It appeared to be a deer, but as Elijah watched the shape trot closer, it realized it was a dog. A dog that looked like it hadn’t eaten in weeks. The dog’s head broke the wood line, nose tilting up to scent the air.

Elijah’s heart went out to the animal, he quietly padded inside to his cabin, grabbing some of his leftover venison. He walked slowly towards the dog, speaking softly to soothe it. The dog did not appear aggressive, instead, it held its head down and licked at its lips in appeasement. The stray tucked its tail and hesitantly took a few steps closer- eyeing to bowl in the man’s hands.

“Hey there, boy,” Elijah cooed, holding out the bowl of meat scraps. “You look like you could use a meal.”

The dog crept closer, its tail made a few weak wags. Elijah observed the dog’s ribs protruding from its sides, its matted brown coat, and the desperation in its eyes. He felt a pang of compassion and reached out to pet the dog’s head. The dog did not back away from the man’s hand but did not seem to enjoy the pet either. If this had been a pet, he would have been dumped months ago. Hell, that alone made him feel some sort of odd kinship with the animal. They were both fending for themselves.

As the dog ate, Elijah couldn’t help but think about how he’d manage to look after the dog. Town was far away; he was hesitant to put a strange animal in his truck. He was even more hesitant to take the poor thing to a shelter, in its condition, it would mostly likely be euthanized. He sighed, internally accepting that he would continue feeding the dog and caring for it- as long as it showed up. After a few moments, the concept of having a pet gave him a renewed sense of purpose. He had something to take care of.

But as he looked into the dog’s eyes, he felt a great pang of longing. It was almost as if he recognized the animal- it somehow reminded him of a childhood dog he had had- perhaps it reminded him of multiple.

“You’ll be okay, boy,” Elijah whispered, stroking the dog’s matted fur. “Youre safe now.”

The dog looked up to the sound of the man’s voice, eyes meeting again. Elijah’s heart dropped again, the dog’s eyes held a look of deep sadness. He at least hoped the animal felt a little better now that it had a full stomach- most likely the first time in a long time the animal had been full. He wanted to feed the dog again but decided against it, as cramming the dog full of food might make it throw up. He did not want to reset any progress that had been made. With a sigh, Elijah reminded himself he needed to get back to his chores.

He rounded the cabin, turning on the water hose to fill up a bowl of water for the dog. The dog sat on its skinny haunches, watching as the man carried and set the bowl down. The dog took a few laps of the water. The leaves rustled in the wood line, most likely a rabbit or squirrel. The dog’s head jerked towards the sound and it trotted back into the woods to investigate the sound.

\-------------------

A week had already passed, and now Elijahs routine had drifted into a comfortable rhythm. He would wake up, feed Ranger- yes, he had taken to naming the dog “Ranger”, and spend the rest of the day working on his latest project. Ranger would follow him around the property, occasionally adventure into the woods, but never failing to return to Elijah’s side. Elijah ruminated on his childhood. His dad would always tell him never to feed a stray, as when you did so, the stray would never leave. However, this time it was okay. The dog had needed help, and the company was welcomed. Elijah reached down to pet Ranger’s head, the dog’s body was now filled out and healthy.

As the weeks went by, Elijah grew accustomed to Ranger’s company, He would talk out loud to the dog, share his thoughts, sometimes tell the dog stories about his life before the cabin. The dog would always perk its ears and gaze towards Elijah, as if the dog was listening intently.

Elijah finished preparing his firewood, taking the bundle in his arms. The moment the dog saw Elijah grab the bundle of firewood, Ranger made his way to the campfire- understanding the rhythm of Elijah’s life- adapting to his routine. This was a quirk that Elijah had grown to enjoy. The night wore on, right as Elijah had the urge to make it to the cabin to retire for the night, Ranger got up and started walking there. Elijah chuckled to himself and followed.

“You tired, buddy?” Elijah asked, the dog curling up on the floor at the side of Elijah’s bed. As he drifted off to sleep, Elijah let an arm drop down to pet the top of Ranger’s head. The soft fur and gentle snoring was comforting- it reminded Elijah that he wasn’t alone up here in the woods.

\-------------

Elijah’s sleep was fitful that night. This was the first time he had experience a nightmare since he had left town. He woke up, mood soured. He came here to be at peace, he had left all of his worries in town- why would they come back to him here? Rubbing his eyes, the visions of the dream washed back over him. He was running through a dense forest, the trees loomed over him like they were entirely too large or he was entirely too small. Something was chasing him, the weight of unseen eyes crushed him. His head spun with vertigo, disorientation haunted him as if he had lost his way in what should be a familiar place.

Opening his eyes to his room, the sun shown through. He had woken up late- the first time he had done so since he left the city. He glanced down, Ranger was no longer there. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, stood up with a yawn, and walked to the window. Ranger was sitting by his bowl, staring at the cabin unblinking with an expectant gaze. Elijah smiled, remember he was late with the dog’s breakfast. It was funny to him that Ranger had grown to be such a creature of habit. He supposed if Ranger had been a stray, never knowing when his next meal would be, the routine was a comfort to him.

“Sorry, boy,” Elijah said, pouring some sliced venison into Ranger’s bowl. “I slept in a bit today.”

Ranger’s tail made a few wags and he bent down to eat. Despite the strange dream, everything was fine. Ranger was healthy, the morning peaceful. Elijah returned back inside, making himself a cup of coffee.

Elijah spent the rest of the day working on his carpentry projects in his work shed. He hammered nails into a wooden beam, something that would later become furniture he would eventually load up and sell in town. He noticed Ranger sitting beside him, eyes watching his hands work with an intensity Elijah had never noticed before. It was almost as if Ranger was trying to understand what Elijah was doing.

“What is it? You gonna start building tables too, boy?” Elijah chuckled. The dog tilted his head, eyes still watching Elijah’s hands work. Soon, Elijah made his way to grab a drink from the cabin, Ranger followed with a fast trot. As Elijah opened the fridge, Ranger positioned himself beside Elijah, nose twitching as he scented the air. Elijah smiled, handing the dog a treat which it took gently from his hand. As he watched Ranger, he noticed the dog took an oddly long time chewing the meat. The leftover venison, Ranger had always just swallowed up as any other dog Elijah had had in the past would. He must have accidently left some gristle in the meat.

Elijah returned to his workshop to put his tools away for the day. He caught Ranger sitting in the spot he had been working in earlier. The dog stood over wood shavings and sawdust, its head tilting as if it was considering the mess. Ranger’s paws were dirty as if he had been digging in the shavings. Elijah took a broom and cleaned up his mess, taking a moment to dust the dog’s paws off to prevent the shavings being tracked into the cabin.

“Come on bud, lets go to bed,” Elijah called to the dog as he went inside.

That night as Elijah drifted off to sleep he couldn’t help but feel odd about how curious Ranger had been in the shed. He hoped there wasn’t anything in the shed that Ranger could sense that he hadn’t seen. It was the time of year snakes would be looking for warm areas. If he or his dog were bitten by a venomous snake, the hour drive into town would not be on their side.

\---------------

The following night, Elijah sat near his campfire, watching the night stars twinkle to life. He had searched in and around the shed all day and found no sign of snakes, spiders, or any other creature. This reminded him of the wildlife had had been feeding, he had seen nothing but birds since he began feeding Ranger. It did make sense, having a dog would ward off the squirrels, coons, and anything else a dog might chase or eat.

Elijah let his eyes close, enjoying the warmth of his fire. “Ready to go to bed, Ranger?” Elijah asked, turning to look at the dog. The dog laid behind him, shielding itself from the fire. Ranger appeared to be asleep, snoring softly, chest rising and falling. Elijah turned his attention to calming the fire.

“Go- Go to bed,” a low voice rumbled so close to Elijah it rattled his chest. He snapped around, only to almost trip on Ranger who was still dead asleep. He could have sworn he heard someone tell him to go to bed. Surely if someone was there, Ranger would have stirred. He must have imagined it. The long days and nights in the woods by himself, isolated from others. The loneliness was getting to him. He sighed, reaching down to pet Ranger. As he stroked Ranger’s coat, the dog’s skin twitched and rippled under his fingers. Ranger’s face was still relaxed, his eyes closed. He stood up, walking to his cabin- he would sleep whatever was wrong off.

\-----------

Elijah woke up early- a voice had awakened him.

“C-come b-uddy lets eat!” The low raspy voice growled. He had to be in a dream, a lucid dream. He jerked himself out of bed, to the window, pulling the curtains back. Ranger was on the porch, standing perfectly upright, his forelimbs looked dislocated and hung loosely at his sides as he stepped with broken and bowed hind legs. Elijah’s stomach plummeted, chills curled tight around him, his heart raced and he felt bile start to eat at the back of his throat. This wasn’t a dream. It was a nightmare. It had to be.

Ranger stepped off the porch, towards the metal bowl, dislocated front limbs dangled as he walked. Elijah could only see Ranger’s back but the animals pelt was damaged, clumps of hair littered the porch.

“Wh-what are--- you looking at? R-rrr-Ranger?” The animal mimicked Elijahs voice, more accurately this time. The animal snapped around, human eyes met Elijah’s through the window. Elijah stumbled backwards, in shock, unable to coordinate himself or his thoughts. His heart was beating so fast his vision was throbbing. Elijah fell down on the hard cabin floor, his limbs suddenly weak and heavy with fear. He grabbed the side of the bed, struggling to haul himself back up- he had to run- he had to get up and run.

The cabin door slammed open, the creatures shape loomed at the doorframe, the sunrise backlighting the misconfigured body. In a flash, the dog leaped forward onto Elijah, strong jaws snapped at Elijahs face, only barely able to fight enough to keep the animals head away from him. Vertigo swarmed him, and his vision blanked as the animals teeth snapped loudly right next to his ear- the ghosting hot breath burned and he struggled to kick the animal off. His hand drifted under the bed, grasping around as he struggled to kick the snapping animal off. Finally his fingers found the handle, grasping around his hunting knife, as the animal lunged he plunged the knife as far as he could into Ranger’s side.

The dog let out a pained yelp that split Elijah’s ears. Ranger’s cries brought tears to his eyes, he sobbed as Ranger’s head fell onto his chest, blood gurgled up from Ranger’s jaws. As Elijah looked down, all he saw was his dog- his pet- Ranger. The animal no long appeared human… all that remained was his pet, wounded, yelping, and crying as the dog thrashed around in his arms.

“Ranger, I’m so sorry, I don’t know what happened,” Elijah lifted Ranger’s head into his arms, stroking over Ranger’s eyes as the dog begun to still.

“No, God, please no, don’t leave me Ranger, I’m sorry!” Elijah sobbed, pressing his face into Ranger’s neck fur.

“Come on buddy, I will get you help, we have to get to the truck,” Elijah tried to blink his tears away, vision blurry. He looked down to his red-stained hands covered in clumps of her. Another wave of vertigo warped his vision as he sobbed again into the dog’s fur. He knew there was no time to make it into town- he was losing his best friend. Ranger went still and limp in his arms.

When Elijah calmed his sobs, he wiped his eyes with a blood stained hand- feeling big clumps of matted fur on his fingers. He looked down and met human eyes- no- his own eyes. Elijah screamed, trying to sit up but couldn’t. The weight of the body kept him down.

The body- the copy, spoke, “Don’t leave me- R-rrrr-Ranger,” it said.

Another heavy wave of vertigo and Elijah blacked out.

\------------

The world was a blur of scents and sounds. Elijah’s senses were coming back one by one. He was running through the woods, running from whatever had happened. He caught a whiff of something savory, that made his stomach growled. How long had it been since he had ate? He quickened his pace, his senses on high alert. He broke the wood line to see a figure that stood ahead- holding out a piece of food.

“Hey there, boy,” the figure said. “You hungry?”

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics) (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, [the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During plasmapheresis](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. [Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your overall diet over several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. [It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, [it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as [it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for [at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. [Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, [the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/) may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is [a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/) if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, [your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine [it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called [an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/) that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be [subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The [drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C) for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically [to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) (STIs). A positive test will result in [either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait [at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating) before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating [to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil) on the needle site [for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having [decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are [particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/) found in plasma.
* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, [you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation [is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I was so excited at the thought of her joining our chapter and I really think she has a good chance of getting a bid so over the summer we occasionally talked about things that we could do together ""when"" she joins the sorority. I'm aware bid promising is a massive no but we never have any filter around each other so I wasn't really thinking about it. she put down her contact info yesterday for COB coffee dates and our director of COB recognized her as being my friend and messaged me asking if I wanted to go on a coffee date with her since we already know each other (these coffee dates are one on one, just one active and one PNM) then afterwards, I would still vote on her just like we do for all our PNMs. I'm worried that this could seem like dirty rushing to CPC or be unfair to other PNMs, because I already am so close with my friend, I would obviously rate her all 5s and say that I see her being a great addition to the chapter. I also would like to note that our COB director is a very minor position that basically only sets up girls with PNMs for coffee dates, and she was not, to my knowledge, trained on anything to do with dirty rushing or rush guidelines like our actual recruitment chair was. so should I decline the coffee date with my friend and express my concern, or am I overreacting and it's fine to do a COB date with a friend? I would not want our chapter to get in trouble with CPC or develop a negative reputation. Thank you!!",3,1755723793.0,Sororities,8,0.8,False

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, [you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation [is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics) (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, [the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During plasmapheresis](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. [Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your overall diet over several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. [It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, [it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as [it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for [at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. [Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, [the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/) may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is [a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/) if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, [your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine [it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called [an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/) that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be [subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The [drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C) for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically [to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) (STIs). A positive test will result in [either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait [at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating) before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating [to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil) on the needle site [for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having [decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are [particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/) found in plasma.
* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

1mvr7pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolTales/comments/1mvr7pe/why_review_the_aerovac_v15_pro_handheld_vacuum/,Why Review the Aerovac V-15 Pro Handheld Vacuum for Portable Cleaning Solutions?,"Testing the Aerovac V-15 Pro Cordless Car Vacuum has been a mix of discovery, convenience, and some unexpected quirks. At first glance, this sleek black and gray handheld vacuum grabbed my attention, promising functionality for cars, desks, and compact spaces. Aerovac V-15 Pro is equipped with features that feel as modern as its design. Lightweight yet powerful, it seemed like the ultimate cleaning companion I didn’t know I needed. It’s been sitting in my passenger seat cubby for weeks now, ready to tackle everything from coffee spills to cookie crumbs.

**Portable Convenience and Elegant Design**

The portability factor was genuinely refreshing. Weighing just 1.2 pounds, the device feels like holding a water bottle. Its compact build makes it incredibly easy to store in a glove box or carry in a small bag, and the included carrying bag was a nice touch. Aesthetics-wise, the black and gray combination gives it a minimalistic elegance that doesn’t scream “utility tool.” This doesn’t just clean; it looks good while doing it.

**Powerful Suction Capacity**

What surprised me the most was the impressive suction power. Rated at 16000Pa, powered by an 80,000 rpm brushless motor, it handled everything I threw its way, from stubborn pet hair to the sand that mysteriously finds its way into the car after beach trips. Two suction modes—Eco and Max—let me prioritize efficiency or raw power. When tidying my desk, Eco mode offered modest suction while keeping the vacuum unbelievably quiet. Switching to Max mode, though, I felt its true potential as it devoured carpet crumbs effortlessly.

[Grab Aerovac V-15 Pro at the best price on Amazon.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b0dpxwvmn6/)

**Attachments That Add Value**

The variety of tools included deserves a mention. The crevice tool reached into narrow areas around car seats, where dust loves to hide, and the brush attachment gently cleaned the keyboard without risking scratches. I also appreciated the air blower function when clearing dust off surfaces like desk ornaments or window sills. This versatility turns it into more than just a vacuum—it's a multi-cleaning device.

**Battery Life That Almost Lasts**

With a runtime of 40 minutes on Eco mode, I hardly had to worry about the vacuum running out mid-task. Most of my cleaning sessions would last under 10 minutes, leaving plenty of juice. In Max mode, though, the battery drains noticeably faster, but it was a trade-off I expected for the added power. Type-C charging support is a huge win in today’s gadget-heavy world. In just around 2.5 to 3 hours, the vacuum was ready to go again, and I could use any charger lying around the house.

**Quick Disposal and Filtration**

One of my favorite aspects is the one-touch emptying system. Pressing a button opens the lid for debris disposal without making a mess. The HEPA filter goes a step further, trapping 95.99% of fine particles to ensure cleaner air while vacuuming. The accompanying fine steel filter adds another level of durability and effective filtration.

**Downsides Worth Considering**

No product is perfect, and the Aerovac V-15 Pro has its faults. Here are a few areas it could improve in:

- The 120 milliliter dustbin felt a little small. It handles everyday cleaning with ease, but you might need to empty it often during extended use.  
- While Type-C compatibility is a blessing, the absence of a detachable battery means you’re out of luck if the battery declines over time.  
- On Max mode, the noise level is noticeable. It’s not eardrum-shattering, but it loses the quiet charm shown in Eco mode.  

**Alternative Offerings**

For those who want similar features, competitors like the Black+Decker Dustbuster or Shark WV201 Wandvac often come up in conversation. While the Dustbuster has a slightly larger capacity and wider nozzle, it doesn’t offer the air-blowing capability. The Wandvac feels very premium but comes with a much steeper price. In comparison, the Aerovac V-15 Pro carves a niche with its mix of affordability, features, and design aesthetics.

**Value Assessment**

Ultimately, the handheld vacuum sits comfortably in the sweet spot of what you pay and what you get. Its functionality matches pricier options, while its versatility—blowing air, cleaning corners, inflating—amps up its usability. Considering its build quality and multi-use capabilities, it feels like money well spent.

1mvr7nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mvr7nw/is_it_ever_okay_to_try_again_in_person_after/,Is it ever okay to try again in person after being ignored online?,"So, I'm taking this free online course through my university. Right from the first class, I noticed one of the guys teaching it was seriously cute. Since he's also an undergrad at my same college, I figured I'd try to shoot my shot and see if anything could happen.

My original plan was to talk to him in person and use some question about the course as an excuse to start a conversation. The problem is, I have no idea what his class schedule is, so ""bumping into him"" around campus is pretty much impossible. My friends told me I should just slide into his DMs on Instagram.

I followed his private account. He accepted my follow request and followed me back. After that, I sent him a DM. It went something like this:

>*Hey \[His Name\], how's it going? I'm in the course you're TAing for—loved your last lecture on Pierre Bourdieu! I'm over at \[My College's Name\] too, so lmk if you ever wanna grab a coffee before class or something! I'd also love to hear about your time studying abroad in France haha.*

Crickets.

He never even opened it. I'm pretty sure he just read the preview in his notifications and left me on read. And I know he was active because he was watching my stories.

So yeah, the message is pretty loud and clear: he's just not that into it. My question is, was my approach totally off? Did I come on too strong? Is there anything I could have done differently, or is this just a hopeless situation?

I can't help but wonder if things would have been different if I'd just talked to him in person. I don't want to be that girl who's pushy or clingy or can't take a hint... but part of me thinks a face-to-face conversation might have had a better shot.",1,1755723664.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1mvr7g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mvr7g0/settling_into_a_routine/,Settling into a Routine,"Elijah stepped out of his cabin, breathing in the crisp morning air. The woods were quiet; the only sound was the rustling of leaves under his feet- he made a mental note to sweep the porch off later. This was his favorite time of day, before the world woke up and the noise began. He didn’t own an alarm clock, but his body always woke him up right at sunrise.

Several years ago, he had chosen to move away from the city- to keep to himself and protect his peace. Leaving behind his hometown and his crazy ex-wife was a giant burden lifted off his shoulders. He had used his savings to secure a humble cabin- he used his hunting and fishing skills to feed himself. Seldom he would load his rusty pickup full of chopped firewood, drive an hour to the nearest town and sell it for extra cash for any necessities he needed. It was a simple life, but it was his- and he was happy.

He walked to the edge of his porch, where a small wooden table held a bowl of scraps. Elijah had grown into the habit of feeding the wildlife that wandered onto his property. He often hunted for his own food and enjoyed giving it back to nature. He poured the remains of last night’s meal into the metal bowl and returned to the porch to sit in his rocking chair. A small squirrel wandered down from a tree, curiously inspecting the bowl. Elijah watched- this was his morning ritual- one that he looked forward to. Before the divorce, Elijah would never have believed he would find his peace alone watching the little critters eat- it was corny- but it was his truth.

Just as he was about to head back inside, he noticed a shape trotting among the trees. It appeared to be a deer, but as Elijah watched the shape trot closer, it realized it was a dog. A dog that looked like it hadn’t eaten in weeks. The dog’s head broke the wood line, nose tilting up to scent the air.

Elijah’s heart went out to the animal, he quietly padded inside to his cabin, grabbing some of his leftover venison. He walked slowly towards the dog, speaking softly to soothe it. The dog did not appear aggressive, instead, it held its head down and licked at its lips in appeasement. The stray tucked its tail and hesitantly took a few steps closer- eyeing to bowl in the man’s hands.

“Hey there, boy,” Elijah cooed, holding out the bowl of meat scraps. “You look like you could use a meal.”

The dog crept closer, its tail made a few weak wags. Elijah observed the dog’s ribs protruding from its sides, its matted brown coat, and the desperation in its eyes. He felt a pang of compassion and reached out to pet the dog’s head. The dog did not back away from the man’s hand but did not seem to enjoy the pet either. If this had been a pet, he would have been dumped months ago. Hell, that alone made him feel some sort of odd kinship with the animal. They were both fending for themselves.

As the dog ate, Elijah couldn’t help but think about how he’d manage to look after the dog. Town was far away; he was hesitant to put a strange animal in his truck. He was even more hesitant to take the poor thing to a shelter, in its condition, it would mostly likely be euthanized. He sighed, internally accepting that he would continue feeding the dog and caring for it- as long as it showed up. After a few moments, the concept of having a pet gave him a renewed sense of purpose. He had something to take care of.

But as he looked into the dog’s eyes, he felt a great pang of longing. It was almost as if he recognized the animal- it somehow reminded him of a childhood dog he had had- perhaps it reminded him of multiple.

“You’ll be okay, boy,” Elijah whispered, stroking the dog’s matted fur. “Youre safe now.”

The dog looked up to the sound of the man’s voice, eyes meeting again. Elijah’s heart dropped again, the dog’s eyes held a look of deep sadness. He at least hoped the animal felt a little better now that it had a full stomach- most likely the first time in a long time the animal had been full. He wanted to feed the dog again but decided against it, as cramming the dog full of food might make it throw up. He did not want to reset any progress that had been made. With a sigh, Elijah reminded himself he needed to get back to his chores.

He rounded the cabin, turning on the water hose to fill up a bowl of water for the dog. The dog sat on its skinny haunches, watching as the man carried and set the bowl down. The dog took a few laps of the water. The leaves rustled in the wood line, most likely a rabbit or squirrel. The dog’s head jerked towards the sound and it trotted back into the woods to investigate the sound.

\-------------------

A week had already passed, and now Elijahs routine had drifted into a comfortable rhythm. He would wake up, feed Ranger- yes, he had taken to naming the dog “Ranger”, and spend the rest of the day working on his latest project. Ranger would follow him around the property, occasionally adventure into the woods, but never failing to return to Elijah’s side. Elijah ruminated on his childhood. His dad would always tell him never to feed a stray, as when you did so, the stray would never leave. However, this time it was okay. The dog had needed help, and the company was welcomed. Elijah reached down to pet Ranger’s head, the dog’s body was now filled out and healthy.

As the weeks went by, Elijah grew accustomed to Ranger’s company, He would talk out loud to the dog, share his thoughts, sometimes tell the dog stories about his life before the cabin. The dog would always perk its ears and gaze towards Elijah, as if the dog was listening intently.

Elijah finished preparing his firewood, taking the bundle in his arms. The moment the dog saw Elijah grab the bundle of firewood, Ranger made his way to the campfire- understanding the rhythm of Elijah’s life- adapting to his routine. This was a quirk that Elijah had grown to enjoy. The night wore on, right as Elijah had the urge to make it to the cabin to retire for the night, Ranger got up and started walking there. Elijah chuckled to himself and followed.

“You tired, buddy?” Elijah asked, the dog curling up on the floor at the side of Elijah’s bed. As he drifted off to sleep, Elijah let an arm drop down to pet the top of Ranger’s head. The soft fur and gentle snoring was comforting- it reminded Elijah that he wasn’t alone up here in the woods.

\-------------

Elijah’s sleep was fitful that night. This was the first time he had experience a nightmare since he had left town. He woke up, mood soured. He came here to be at peace, he had left all of his worries in town- why would they come back to him here? Rubbing his eyes, the visions of the dream washed back over him. He was running through a dense forest, the trees loomed over him like they were entirely too large or he was entirely too small. Something was chasing him, the weight of unseen eyes crushed him. His head spun with vertigo, disorientation haunted him as if he had lost his way in what should be a familiar place.

Opening his eyes to his room, the sun shown through. He had woken up late- the first time he had done so since he left the city. He glanced down, Ranger was no longer there. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, stood up with a yawn, and walked to the window. Ranger was sitting by his bowl, staring at the cabin unblinking with an expectant gaze. Elijah smiled, remember he was late with the dog’s breakfast. It was funny to him that Ranger had grown to be such a creature of habit. He supposed if Ranger had been a stray, never knowing when his next meal would be, the routine was a comfort to him.

“Sorry, boy,” Elijah said, pouring some sliced venison into Ranger’s bowl. “I slept in a bit today.”

Ranger’s tail made a few wags and he bent down to eat. Despite the strange dream, everything was fine. Ranger was healthy, the morning peaceful. Elijah returned back inside, making himself a cup of coffee.

Elijah spent the rest of the day working on his carpentry projects in his work shed. He hammered nails into a wooden beam, something that would later become furniture he would eventually load up and sell in town. He noticed Ranger sitting beside him, eyes watching his hands work with an intensity Elijah had never noticed before. It was almost as if Ranger was trying to understand what Elijah was doing.

“What is it? You gonna start building tables too, boy?” Elijah chuckled. The dog tilted his head, eyes still watching Elijah’s hands work. Soon, Elijah made his way to grab a drink from the cabin, Ranger followed with a fast trot. As Elijah opened the fridge, Ranger positioned himself beside Elijah, nose twitching as he scented the air. Elijah smiled, handing the dog a treat which it took gently from his hand. As he watched Ranger, he noticed the dog took an oddly long time chewing the meat. The leftover venison, Ranger had always just swallowed up as any other dog Elijah had had in the past would. He must have accidently left some gristle in the meat.

Elijah returned to his workshop to put his tools away for the day. He caught Ranger sitting in the spot he had been working in earlier. The dog stood over wood shavings and sawdust, its head tilting as if it was considering the mess. Ranger’s paws were dirty as if he had been digging in the shavings. Elijah took a broom and cleaned up his mess, taking a moment to dust the dog’s paws off to prevent the shavings being tracked into the cabin.

“Come on bud, lets go to bed,” Elijah called to the dog as he went inside.

That night as Elijah drifted off to sleep he couldn’t help but feel odd about how curious Ranger had been in the shed. He hoped there wasn’t anything in the shed that Ranger could sense that he hadn’t seen. It was the time of year snakes would be looking for warm areas. If he or his dog were bitten by a venomous snake, the hour drive into town would not be on their side.

\---------------

The following night, Elijah sat near his campfire, watching the night stars twinkle to life. He had searched in and around the shed all day and found no sign of snakes, spiders, or any other creature. This reminded him of the wildlife had had been feeding, he had seen nothing but birds since he began feeding Ranger. It did make sense, having a dog would ward off the squirrels, coons, and anything else a dog might chase or eat.

Elijah let his eyes close, enjoying the warmth of his fire. “Ready to go to bed, Ranger?” Elijah asked, turning to look at the dog. The dog laid behind him, shielding itself from the fire. Ranger appeared to be asleep, snoring softly, chest rising and falling. Elijah turned his attention to calming the fire.

“Go- Go to bed,” a low voice rumbled so close to Elijah it rattled his chest. He snapped around, only to almost trip on Ranger who was still dead asleep. He could have sworn he heard someone tell him to go to bed. Surely if someone was there, Ranger would have stirred. He must have imagined it. The long days and nights in the woods by himself, isolated from others. The loneliness was getting to him. He sighed, reaching down to pet Ranger. As he stroked Ranger’s coat, the dog’s skin twitched and rippled under his fingers. Ranger’s face was still relaxed, his eyes closed. He stood up, walking to his cabin- he would sleep whatever was wrong off.

\-----------

Elijah woke up early- a voice had awakened him.

“C-come b-uddy lets eat!” The low raspy voice growled. He had to be in a dream, a lucid dream. He jerked himself out of bed, to the window, pulling the curtains back. Ranger was on the porch, standing perfectly upright, his forelimbs looked dislocated and hung loosely at his sides as he stepped with broken and bowed hind legs. Elijah’s stomach plummeted, chills curled tight around him, his heart raced and he felt bile start to eat at the back of his throat. This wasn’t a dream. It was a nightmare. It had to be.

Ranger stepped off the porch, towards the metal bowl, dislocated front limbs dangled as he walked. Elijah could only see Ranger’s back but the animals pelt was damaged, clumps of hair littered the porch.

“Wh-what are--- you looking at? R-rrr-Ranger?” The animal mimicked Elijahs voice, more accurately this time. The animal snapped around, human eyes met Elijah’s through the window. Elijah stumbled backwards, in shock, unable to coordinate himself or his thoughts. His heart was beating so fast his vision was throbbing. Elijah fell down on the hard cabin floor, his limbs suddenly weak and heavy with fear. He grabbed the side of the bed, struggling to haul himself back up- he had to run- he had to get up and run.

The cabin door slammed open, the creatures shape loomed at the doorframe, the sunrise backlighting the misconfigured body. In a flash, the dog leaped forward onto Elijah, strong jaws snapped at Elijahs face, only barely able to fight enough to keep the animals head away from him. Vertigo swarmed him, and his vision blanked as the animals teeth snapped loudly right next to his ear- the ghosting hot breath burned and he struggled to kick the animal off. His hand drifted under the bed, grasping around as he struggled to kick the snapping animal off. Finally his fingers found the handle, grasping around his hunting knife, as the animal lunged he plunged the knife as far as he could into Ranger’s side.

The dog let out a pained yelp that split Elijah’s ears. Ranger’s cries brought tears to his eyes, he sobbed as Ranger’s head fell onto his chest, blood gurgled up from Ranger’s jaws. As Elijah looked down, all he saw was his dog- his pet- Ranger. The animal no long appeared human… all that remained was his pet, wounded, yelping, and crying as the dog thrashed around in his arms.

“Ranger, I’m so sorry, I don’t know what happened,” Elijah lifted Ranger’s head into his arms, stroking over Ranger’s eyes as the dog begun to still.

“No, God, please no, don’t leave me Ranger, I’m sorry!” Elijah sobbed, pressing his face into Ranger’s neck fur.

“Come on buddy, I will get you help, we have to get to the truck,” Elijah tried to blink his tears away, vision blurry. He looked down to his red-stained hands covered in clumps of her. Another wave of vertigo warped his vision as he sobbed again into the dog’s fur. He knew there was no time to make it into town- he was losing his best friend. Ranger went still and limp in his arms.

When Elijah calmed his sobs, he wiped his eyes with a blood stained hand- feeling big clumps of matted fur on his fingers. He looked down and met human eyes- no- his own eyes. Elijah screamed, trying to sit up but couldn’t. The weight of the body kept him down.

The body- the copy, spoke, “Don’t leave me- R-rrrr-Ranger,” it said.

Another heavy wave of vertigo and Elijah blacked out.

\------------

The world was a blur of scents and sounds. Elijah’s senses were coming back one by one. He was running through the woods, running from whatever had happened. He caught a whiff of something savory, that made his stomach growled. How long had it been since he had ate? He quickened his pace, his senses on high alert. He broke the wood line to see a figure that stood ahead- holding out a piece of food.

“Hey there, boy,” the figure said. “You hungry?”

I am however a huge chai latte girlie, and i like to have one in the mornings as opposed to coffee. however a chai latte at a cafe can range from $5-8!!! this adds up. 

I know that the most economically safe option is to make the concentrate at home, but i see online SO many ways to make it. Has anyone made the chai concentrate? I honestly do not have a well paletted tea taste so I don't think that I would mind a cheaper or 'non-authentic' option... i'm just tryna getter doneee!!! 

Any advice? I would hopefully like a recipe that I can use for about 6 large cups of chai's, so i can make this weekly :) ",2,1755723652.0,tea,0,0.75,False

1mvr63o,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1mvr63o/looking_for_feedback/,Looking for feedback,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a short story called *Mercy Seat* (part of my larger project *22 Songs; all the stories are titled after songs*) and I’ve hit a wall. It’s somewhere between a short story and maybe something larger (even a scene from a play?), and while I think the core is strong, I’m struggling with pacing.

My goal is for it to resonate on two levels: I want it to land with readers of faith (the concept of continuing to serve a Religion that is diametrically opposed to your existence and without possible salvation) just as much as it does with someone who comes in looking for a vampire story. Right now, though, I feel like the Hale section doesn’t quite feel earned, and I’m not sure how to fix that.

I’d really appreciate any feedback on how to tighten the pacing and strengthen the payoff. Thanks in advance for taking a look!

**The Mercy Seat – Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds**

 

**CITY OF SAN DAMIANO POLICE DEPARTMENT**  
**HOMICIDE DIVISION – VAMPIRIC CRIME UNIT**  
**CASE NO.:** 23-4517-VCU  
**DATE:** 11/14/2048  
**TIME:** 21:03 hrs  
**LOCATION:** INTERVIEW ROOM 3 – S.D.P.D. HQ  
**INTERVIEWER:** DET. MICHAEL ROURKE  
**SUBJECT:** FATHER ELIAS QUINLIN (UNLICENSED VAMPIRIC ACTIVITY SUSPECT)

**\[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** Thank you for meeting with us today. You understand you are not under arrest, and are simply here for questioning?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I Understand.

**DET. ROURKE:** Good. For the record, please state your name.  
**FATHER QUINLIN:** Father Elias Quinlin. **\[Glances at cuffs\]** Though I don't recall Our Lord putting volunteers in chains.  
**DET. ROURKE:** Department policy when interviewing your kind. Specially made with a Holy Oil resin interior. **\[Flips file open\]** You came willingly when Officer Thompson approached you this morning. Why?  
**FATHER QUINLIN:** Because he asked politely. And because... **\[sniffs air\]** ...you have coffee in that thermos. Colombian, if I'm not mistaken. May I? **\[Rattles cuffs\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** I didn’t know that your kind can drink.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Drink? No, of course not. I just love the smell of it. May I sniff yours closer?

**DET. ROURKE: \[Ignores request\]** Let's talk about St. Brigid's. You were seen there at 2:15 AM.  
**FATHER QUINLIN:** ""Seen"" is such an interesting word, Detective. Did your witness see me... or see *what they feared*? The fog was thick last night.  
**DET. ROURKE: \[Slides crime scene photo across table\]** Throat torn out. Unlicensed bite. Victim was Father Lino Ortega. You knew him.

**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Long pause\]** I knew him well...He always hated the cold. Would wear two cassocks in winter. **\[Eyes harden\]** Was it quick?  
**DET. ROURKE:** No.  
**FATHER QUINLIN:** I’m sorry to hear that, he was a very good man. It couldn’t have been me, I take only volunteer blood from the program. **\[Leans forward, chains creaking\]** But you already knew that when you called me in. So why am I really here, Detective?

 

**DET. ROURKE:** Just because you say you didn’t do it doesn’t make this go away. That’s not how it works.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** That’s exactly how it works. We both know what I am detective. I’m not going to pretend I’m not a monster **\[he tries to extend his atrophied fangs\]**, but I don’t relish the curse. The Lord has spoken to me and helped me find another way.

**DET. ROURKE:** We’ve got multiple witnesses that saw you in the area. You’re gonna tell me you didn’t see or hear anything?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Detective… the guilty don’t linger at the scene. The faithful do. Sometimes the difference is hard to spot. I never said I didn’t see anything, but you are hoping that I will say something that will put this matter to rest, and unfortunately that’s not the position I find myself in.

**\[Det. Rourke flips a photograph of a portrait of a priest onto the table.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** This was Father Ortega, correct? You were friends with him?  
**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Hands trembling slightly as he adjusts his sleeves, revealing track marks from legal pig-blood IVs\]**  
Yes. He used to bring me... *supplements*. Such a good man.

**DET. ROURKE:** Supplements?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** They call it the Judas Serum. **\[He pulls a small vial of murky liquid attached to a necklace\]** It’s brewed by a monastic order. A mixture of pigs blood and donations from the brothers. The synthetic is no good for nutrition, it would be like trying to live on nothing but hash browns from McDonalds.

**DET. ROURKE:** He’s the one in the alley.  
**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Eyes flick to Rourke’s neck, pupils dilating briefly before he forces them still\]**  
Then I pray his soul rests. But we both know I couldn’t have done that. Not anymore.

**DET. ROURKE:** Someone did — and they didn’t have a license to take what they took.  
**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Weak chuckle, gesturing to his gaunt frame\]**

License. That’s a grand notion, is it not? No better way to clear the conscious of man than to have the monsters carry out the sanctioned executions. Am I right? **\[audibly sighs\]**  
""The laborer is worthy of his hire,"" Detective. Luke 10:7. **\[Pulls back lips again to show dulled, atrophied fangs\]**  
I take only what’s given these days. Pig’s blood. Synthetic plasma. \[**Swallows hard\]**  
Some of us know what we are but seek to stand our moral ground. Whoever did this? They have no moral ground.

 

 

 

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[Slides wide angle crime scene photo across table\]***  
Then you won’t mind looking.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Turns the photo face-down without looking\]***  
I don’t need to see. I’ve seen man torn asunder before; I certainly do not have the taste to see my friend in the same way.

**DET. ROURKE:** We both know I need you to look at that photo **\[flipping it back over\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN: \[taking it into his hand, a look of sadness on his face\]** The hunger... leaves marks. **\[Taps the photo to his forehead\]**  
This alley reeked of rage, not starvation. **\[Coughs into a handkerchief flecked with black—pig-blood residue\]**  
But by all means, Detective. Check my permits. My last legal feeding was... *\[****squints as if struggling to remember\]***Ah. Three months ago. At Saint Vincent’s swine bank. Terrible merlot notes.

\[**DET. ROURKE pulls another photo from the dossier, this one of an old man, pulled from his wheelchair and splayed in front of a fountain with his throat ripped open\].**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Audible intake of breath, voice tightening\]*** That’s… an absolute shame to see. He was a very good man. This wasn’t done from hunger this was done out of ritual.

**DET. ROURKE:** Rituals aren’t my beat. That’s—

***\[DOOR BURSTS OPEN. OFFICER MARCUS HALE ENTERS.\]***

**HALE:** ***\[Tossing file\]***  
Rourke—Captain’s screaming about the press. ***\[Turns slowly to Quinlin\]***  
Ah. The *vegetarian* bloodsucker. Heard you like your meals... *ethical*.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Nostrils flare—catches copper beneath Hale’s aftershave\]***  
Officer… ***\[Weak smile\]***

***HALE:*** *Hale.*

***FATHER QUINLIN:*** *Officer Hale,* I prefer my conscience clean. Even if it leaves me... **\[gestures to gaunt frame\]** ...hungry.

**HALE: \[Flips open Quinlin’s file\]**  
Funny thing. **\[Taps page\]**  
VCU says your fang retraction should be *complete* after three months on pig swill. ***\[Leans in\]***  
Yet yours still *click*. ***\[Demonstrates—Forcing Quinlin’s mouth open and tapping the fangs with his pen. The teeth twitch\]***

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Covers mouth with handkerchief—more black flecks\]***  
A... side effect of the supplements. ***\[Eyes dart to Hale’s wrist—no VCU bracelet\]***  
But you’d know all about *side effects*, wouldn’t you, Officer?

**HALE: \[Barks laugh\]** Cute. **\[Snaps file shut\]** Rourke—check the victim’s *collar*. Ripped clean off. **\[Pauses at door\]** Almost like the killer was hunting... *taking trophies*.

***DET. ROURKE:*** Want me to go see Captain?

**HALE:** No, I’ll handle it, I just wanted to meet our friend.

***\[DOOR SLAMS. SILENCE THICKENS.\]***

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Whispers\]*** That man... **\[licks lips\]** He doesn’t smell like the rest of you.

**DET. ROURKE:** Sorry for that, can we get back to Father Ortega?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Now he rests, and I remain. That is the greatest difference between us.

**DET. ROURKE:** Tell me about your time in the Church. Before.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Twenty-eight years in the Priesthood before I was given this burden **\[exposing his fangs and pointing to them\]**. Two rural parishes, one in the city. Baptisms, weddings, funerals. I knew every soul under my care. Fed the hungry, buried the dead.

**DET. ROURKE:** And when were you turned?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Fifty-four years ago. Two years after the ordination of Father Ortega.

**DET. ROURKE:** By who?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** A man who hated the sight of anyone with faith. Not just priests — anyone who believed in something higher than himself. He thought that the greatest punishment he could give was to take salvation away from a priest.

**DET. ROURKE:** Why you?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I wore the collar. I didn’t hide my convictions. To him, that was arrogance. He called it “tearing down the scaffolding” — said he’d prove my devotion was nothing but fear dressed up as virtue. He wanted me to feel the hunger eat me from the inside until I joined him in the pit.

**DET. ROURKE:** Did it?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Smiles faintly.\]*** A man can be stripped of his heartbeat, Detective, but not of his vows. It’s funny detective, I was an old man when I was turned. \[**He begins to laugh\]** You would think that immortality would be the greatest gift bestowed on an old man. But it isn’t.

**DET. ROURKE:** How do you mean? Don’t you people have powers?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Powers? Sure…But I also have arthritis. I also have a boggy prostate and a Urethra the size of a WD-40 straw.

**DET. ROURKE:** That sounds awful.

**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Laughs loudly\]** They never tell you about that part of this whole thing, do they detective? The state of your body gets frozen in time. Just another Albatross to wear upon the neck I guess, it could be worse.

**DET. ROURKE:** You can’t take the Eucharist anymore, can you?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No. Nor the wine. Both burn like hot iron against the tongue. I’ve tried taking them, but it’s so painful that I only do when my soul demands it of me. But I kneel with my parish still. I lead the Lords Prayer at the sunset service. I anoint the sick with gloves. I bury the dead before the sun rises.

**DET. ROURKE:** Even though the Church doesn’t recognize you anymore?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Recognition is for men. Our parish has made special allowances for me. Service is for God.

**DET. ROURKE:** That’s not the same as absolution.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No. But perhaps it’s close enough until the trumpet sounds. It’s a heavy load to bare, to know that no matter how long Revelation takes, I’ll be here to see it when it does. I may bury countless generations of family lines before it comes, but I’ll be here to see the final days when Our Lord returns.

**DET. ROURKE:** You still believe, after… all this?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Faith isn’t belief without proof. It’s belief despite proof. Even when the proof is your own reflection in the dark — and the knowledge you cast no shadow. If this wickedness exists, don’t you see? It means that a good of equalness must exist as well. I know that I cannot be seen as in Service of The Lord when the end comes, but that is why how I’m trying to lead my life is sacrosanct—there is no purpose to it, no goal to work towards, just service to a God that sees my kind as monstrous.

**DET. ROURKE:** And the hunger?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** The hunger is the thorn in my side, Detective. St. Paul spoke of it. A reminder that I am weak, and that grace is not without cost. I try not to succumb to it, when I do it’s through the donation programs. Although, I have to say there was a time when I succumbed to it fully.

**\[Rourke studies him for a long moment, pen unmoving over his notepad.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** Tell me about that, Father.

**\[Minutes of silence of tape static are present as the side ends.\]**

**SIDE B – TRANSCRIPT ONE**

**DET. ROURKE:** Tell me about that, Father.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** It was years ago. Before the parish agreed to my… allowances. Before I learned the discipline I have now. Before they gave us that had no taste for killing an alternative.

**DET. ROURKE:** You fed illegally?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I fed… deliberately. **\[Pauses\]** From men who had done worse than I ever could.

**DET. ROURKE:** Who were they?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** **\[Voice cools, almost clinical.\]** Shepherds who preyed upon their own flock. Priests who harmed children in their care. Deacons who used the confessional to groom the vulnerable.

**DET. ROURKE:** And you decided to play executioner.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No, Detective. Executioner implies swiftness, mercy. What I did… was not merciful. Is not the man that feeds upon the predator, still in a way, no better than the wolf that stalks the night, looking for the weak in the flock?

DET. ROURKE: To be clear, you understand that any crimes you voluntarily report will be tried? There is no statute of limitations at play here.

FATHER QUINLIN: I understand, the truth must be known.

DET. ROURKE: Excuse me, Eli.

**\[DET. ROURKE leaves the room, an hour and a half passes, QUINLIN sits unmoved.\]**

**\[Begin Transcript Section 2\]**

**\[At 3:48AM DET. ROURKE enters the room\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** **\[Opens a folder, spreads three photographs across the table.\]** Recognize them?

**\[Quinlin glances once, then looks away. He does not touch the photos.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Yes.

**DET. ROURKE:** That’s Father Reardon, Monsignor Levesque, and Bishop Kane. All three drained. All three without a license in your name. Correct?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** **\[Quietly.\]** All three stood in pulpits and called themselves men of God. All three used that trust to destroy lives. All three no longer will have the chance to damage another, I saw to that.

**DET. ROURKE:** To be clear, Eli, you are admitting to the unlawful draining of Father Matthew Barthalamew Readon, Monsignor Jean-Tomas Levesque, and Bishop Jonathan Lawrence Kane.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Yes sir. When I agreed to this interview, detective, I informed you that I would tell no lies, nor profess an innocence that I do not possess. I’m saying they were already dead long before I found them. I merely saw that the body matched the soul.

**DET. ROURKE:** That wasn’t your call to make.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** **\[Looks up, faint steel in his eyes.\]** Then whose is it? The Church? The courts? How many cases get buried with the victims? All three were under investigation, were they not? Were not all three protected by The Church and moved Dioceses?

**DET. ROURKE:** That’s not justice, Father. That’s vengeance.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Perhaps. But when you’ve looked into the eyes of a weeping child whose abuser wears the same collar as you… tell me, Detective, what scripture do you expect to cling to then? From what I know, you came from Special Crimes before handling our kind, correct?

**DET. ROURKE:** That’s correct, eleven years.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** So you know better than anyone should, that look and what it does to you. A child, a child by the sake of God, clutching themselves with that look in their eyes. Do you know the worst part of this gift, sir? It’s being able to see someone’s greatest trauma in vivid detail within the center of the pupil. Can you imagine what it is like to look a six year old in the eyes, as they clutch a stuffed animal, and see the act of a man of the cloth defiling them? Of hearing him tell them it was God’s will?

**DET. ROURKE:** So you justify killing because you believe your victims deserve it.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No. I justify it because I cannot undo their harm. I can only stop it from continuing. I cannot do anything to make their victims feel at peace, only to make sure that they’re given the safety of knowing that it won’t happen again.

**\[Rourke leans back, studies him. First flicker of doubt in his own certainty. Minutes pass in silence.\]**

**\[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT – SECTION 3\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** I appreciate your candor Eli, Let me tell you what to expect. We are going to reopen the cases with the new confession that you will sign tonight. After the confession is filed an arrest warrant will be issued for you. I would expect that a group from the Helsing unit will come to apprehend you tomorrow evening. Because of your candor in the matter, I have been notified that you will be allowed to go home tonight and sleep within your own coffin one more night.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I will be surrendering myself.

**DET. ROURKE:** I wouldn’t expect any less of you. Thank you **\[Rourke pats Quinlin on the hand\]** Can you help me with Ortega before you leave? I’m sure that if you had any involvement you would have told me, but we’ve got statements, Father. People who saw someone that looks a lot like you the night Ortega died.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** “Looks like me” is a broad church, Detective. Do they mean to say a vampire? An old man? A priest?

**DET. ROURKE:** *\[Flips open a folder.\]* Witness One — Margaret Doyle. Says she saw a man in a black coat with a clerical collar moving through the alley just before the scream.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Okay, so we know it was someone of the cloth, or at least someone that wanted to appear to be someone of the cloth. Was she in the courtyard where it happened?

**DET. ROURKE:** No, she was smoking on her balcony.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** From how far?

**DET. ROURKE:** Across the street. Forensics has it measured at 57’9”. So lets call it 60 feet.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** At night. Through fog.

**DET. ROURKE:** She’s got good eyesight.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** So did Peter, and he still mistook his Lord for a ghost on the water.

**DET. ROURKE:** Witness Two — Anthony Vale. Claims he saw pale hands at Ortega’s throat. Someone hunched in the crook of his neck.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Pale hands. Does he describe the bite?

**DET. ROURKE:** Says it was quick but violent.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** If it was me it wouldn’t have been clean. Are you sure it wasn’t a newly turned feeding for the first time?

**DET. ROURKE:** Because you’re sloppy?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Because I don’t kill clean, Detective. Not when the prey is from inside the fold. I make them feel what they made their victims feel — helpless, terrified, known. When you’re doing it from duty, it must be clear why.

**\[Rourke’s pen stills on the page.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** You’re saying you would prolong the suffering.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I’m saying sheep-stealers don’t deserve a shepherd’s mercy. They decide to die scared.

**DET. ROURKE:** You don’t think that makes you a wolf?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No. I was something worse. A wolf kills because it is hungry. I would kill because they were wolves wearing wool.

**DET. ROURKE:** Witness Three — anonymous. Just says they saw a shadow near the fountain and the glint of an elderly man in a collar.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Smiles faintly.\]*** Witnesses see what fits their conscience, not what’s there.

**DET. ROURKE:** Meaning?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Meaning they see a collar and think priest. They see pale skin and think vampire. Sometimes they’re right. Sometimes they’re wrong. And sometimes they see what they need to see so they can sleep at night.

**DET. ROURKE:** And what do you see, Father?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I see the rot that hides behind vestments, and the flock too afraid to call it by name. Most of our kind never approaches the church. To someone like us the church is painful to be near. Imagine walking near an electrified fence. The thrum that comes off of the place is painful.

**\[Rourke closes the folder, but leaves it on the table, as if weighing whether to keep pushing.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** Yet still you serve?

**Father Quinlin:** Yes, I still serve. The pain is always present, but it is the will of God.

\[**ROURKE leaves the room and returns with a fresh thermos of coffee, that he puts in front of FATHER QUINLIN, who sits silently and breathes in the aroma, smiling.\]**

 

**\[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT – SECTION 5\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** You’re a lapsed Catholic. But part of you still believes.

**DET. ROURKE:** What makes you say that?

**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Looks at him steadily.\]** The way you flinch when I say *Our Lord*. Not from fear. From memory. Like a man smelling bread after a long famine. You hunger for it. Why not return, my son?

**DET. ROURKE:** You think you know me from that?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I know you have a daughter. Young. Ten, maybe eleven. I can see the memory of her birthday, it was snowing, that’s the last time you saw her. She’s with her mother. You haven’t seen her in months. Not since they left. You want them back.

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[Leans forward.\]*** How the hell do you—

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Because you keep your wedding band in your pocket. You’ve taken it out three times since you sat down underneath. I can hear it click against the table leg. And you keep your wallet angled toward yourself when you open it, but not to hide money. To hide her picture.

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[Tightens jaw.\]***

**FATHER QUINLIN:** You know what it is to lose faith, Detective. In your Church. In your vows. In your own worth. Look me in the eye and tell me I do not profess the truth.

**DET. ROURKE:** And you’re any different?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I am worse. I am… beyond redemption. My soul is locked outside the gates for all eternity, and I know it. Every prayer I say echoes back to me, unanswered. I say them not to hear a voice come back, but just so that Our Lord knows, still I fight, still I toil.

**DET. ROURKE:** Then why bother?

**FATHER QUINLIN: \[Leans in slightly.\]** Because it is still *right*. Because if the wickedness I am is real, then the good I cling to must also be real. I have no key to the Kingdom, Detective. I will never kneel at the feet of The Lamb. But the children I protect, the flock I guard — they will. And if I can see them safely to that table, that will be my only feast, the knowledge that they eat.

**DET. ROURKE:** You don’t think that’s futile?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Of course it’s futile. That’s what makes it holy.

**\[Rourke sits back, studying him as though unsure whether to be moved or unnerved.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Milton was right in Paradise Lost— it is easier to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. But he forgot to mention… it is harder still to serve Heaven when you know you will never enter it.

**DET. ROURKE:** And yet you keep serving.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Not for me. For them. So that when the gates open for the last of the flock, I can stand outside and know I did not lead them astray. That when others sought their destruction, I avenged them to give the chance to heal the wounds. The best I can hope for is to shake the hand of St. Peter to show I mean no harm and return to the plains of the mortal. Just us Vampires and Lucifer stuck below the eternal peace.

**\[Quinlin folds his hands. For the first time, Rourke looks away.\]**

 

**\[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT – SECTION 6\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Ortega wasn’t a predator.

**DET. ROURKE:** That’s generous.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** He loved his flock. Fed them in ways I never can. But he turned his face from wolves when they wore the right vestments.

**DET. ROURKE:** You saying he looked the other way?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Yes. And in God’s eyes, that’s enough to make you complicit.

**DET. ROURKE:** You think omission is the same as the act.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** In his case? No. His lack of action was between him and God. But it makes you think. When you’re charged with guarding the flock, turning away is worse. The wolf has teeth — that’s his nature. But the shepherd’s failure? That’s a choice.

**\[Quinlin studies Rourke for a long moment.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** You know this, don’t you?

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[Flatly.\]*** I’ve had my moments.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Moments that cost you.

**DET. ROURKE:** My wife couldn’t understand why I wouldn’t speak up. She didn’t see what would happen if I broke the line.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** And did the line protect the flock? Or the wolves?

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[Quietly.\]*** Both.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** That’s the rot, my son. The rule that says you protect your own — even when your own deserve the stone.

**DET. ROURKE:** And who are you to want me to cross it?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I want you to step where your oath to God matters more than your oath to men. No blood will be on your hands, I will see to that.

**DET. ROURKE:** I don’t understand what you’re asking for.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I promised I would tell you no lies. The truth at the heart of things is this, The witness on the balcony—

**DET. ROURKE:** Margaret Doyle.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Yes, Miss Doyle was right, she did see me there. I was too late to save Father Ortega. I saw a man rip away his Cossack to reveal a police uniform before turning to mist. I thought it was you, that’s why I came in.

**\[FATHER QUINLIN rose, snapping his handcuffs, the centers burning his skin like acid, and was nose to nose with ROURKE sniffing him\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** It isn’t you. I smell no copper on you.

**DET. ROURKE:** What are you saying?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I know my own kind, the man in here before, Hale, he is who I’m seeking.

**DET. ROURKE:** I can’t knowingly hand a man over to you, Father. Not if it damns me too.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Then don’t hand him over. Just… leave the gate open. I can read it in you, don’t protect him any longer, let the justice he deserves meet him.

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[Narrows eyes.\]***

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Say nothing. Or mention, in passing, where a certain man will be and when. Let Providence — or whatever I am — do the rest. You can call it an accident of conversation.

**\[Quinlin leans forward, the chain on his cuffs groaning until the steel link gives way with a crisp snap. He stands, the skin of his wrists bubbling, stepping into Rourke’s space.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Sniffs lightly near Rourke’s neck.\]*** Not fear. Not guilt. You’re still a good man.

**DET. ROURKE:** How did you…you done judging me?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** That’s not judgment. That’s hope. Help me pin the right one for Ortega’s death. You’ll know what to say — and what not to say — when the time comes.

**DET. ROURKE:** ***\[After a beat.\]*** Be careful, Father.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** ***\[Long pause, faint smile.\]*** I’ve been many things, Detective. But I’ve never been careless.

**\[Quinlin returns to his chair and folds his hands as though the moment never happened. Minutes pass\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** *\[Flips a page in the file.\]* This… I can’t speak to this.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Can’t or won’t?

**DET. ROURKE:** Not my lane. Ballistics, maybe — vampiric feeding patterns aren’t my area. But there’s someone here who knows.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** **\[Watches him closely.\]** Hale.

**DET. ROURKE:** Sit tight. I’ll bring him in.

**\[Rourke stands, gathers the file, and leaves the room without looking back. Camera/audio feed continues.\]**

**\[Two minutes pass. Door opens. Officer Marcus Hale enters — tall, broad, wearing a tactical jacket. No greeting. He sits across from Quinlin, tossing the file onto the table.\]**

**HALE:** You killed those men? What about Ortega, you killed him too?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I know what he allowed.

**HALE:** He allowed nothing. You’re the one who—

**\[Quinlin’s head tilts, eyes narrowing.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** The smell on you. It’s the same as the alley.

**HALE:** You think you’re clever.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I know what you did, Marcus. I know how many. Ortega was just the only one who made you nervous enough to rush.

**HALE:** You don’t know anything.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I know enough to damn you twice. Once for the blood. Once for the uniform.

**\[Hale leans forward, baring fangs just slightly.\]**

**HALE:** You think you can take me?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** I don’t think.

**\[Movement blurs — Hale lunges across the table, sending it skidding back. Quinlin catches him mid-strike, chair toppling. They crash into the far wall. Audio picks up snarling, a heavy thud, the snap of wood. Two seconds later, Quinlin drives Hale’s head into the cinderblock with a sound like wet paper tearing. Silence.\]**

**\[Quinlin straightens, face and collar spattered crimson. He looks directly at the camera.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Self-defense. You all saw it.

**\[Door bursts open — Rourke and two uniforms rush in. Quinlin steps back, hands raised, cuffs broken again at the chain.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** *\[Looking from Hale’s body to Quinlin.\]* Christ.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No. Not even close.

**\[Uniforms secure Hale’s body. One officer starts to speak; Rourke cuts him off.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** Log it. Self-defense. Keep the footage clean.

**OFFICER:** You sure, Detective?

**DET. ROURKE:** I was in the hall. I saw enough.

**\[Officer nods, leaves. Door shuts. Only Rourke and Quinlin remain.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** You left the gate open, Detective.

**DET. ROURKE:** You walked through it.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** That’s what gates are for.

**\[Quinlin takes a step closer, wiping his collar with the edge of his sleeve. His eyes are steady, voice low.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** There will be more like him. Maybe worse. And you’ll be asked to stand guard over them.

**DET. ROURKE:** That’s the job.

**FATHER QUINLIN:** No. The job is the flock. The badge is just the crook in your hand.

**\[Rourke looks away, jaw tight. Quinlin studies him a moment longer, then softens.\]**

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Call her, Michael.

**DET. ROURKE:** …What?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Your wife. Tell her you finally stood against the wolf. Tell her you’re ready for her to come home.

**DET. ROURKE:** And if she doesn’t?

**FATHER QUINLIN:** Then you’ll still have done what was right. And that is the only gate worth standing before.

**\[Quinlin sits, folding his hands. Rourke watches him for a beat, then turns toward the door.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** We’re done here.

 

**\[AUDIO RESUMES – LOBBY CAMERA\]**  
**\[Rourke steps out of the interview wing into the empty front lobby. He pauses under the buzzing fluorescents, pulls a phone from his pocket. Dials. Waits.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** Hey. It’s me… Yeah… I just… I wanted to tell you something.

**\[Long pause. A faint smile. He turns toward the glass doors as the first light of dawn spills into the lobby.\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** I’m ready for you to come home. Maybe we can meet for coffee tomorrow?

\[**QUINLIN WALKS PAST HIM AND PUTS HIS HAND ON ROURKES SHOULDER, WHICH ROURKE PUTS HIS HAND OVER. BEFORE QUINLIN DISAPPEARS INTO MIST\]**

**DET. ROURKE:** Sounds great, love you too.

1mvr57h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HacksAndRiddles/comments/1mvr57h/bragg_gaming_group_cybersecurity_incident_no/,Bragg Gaming Group cybersecurity incident: no player data impacted,"Well, well — yet another gambling tech firm just had its servers tickled by hackers. Meet **Bragg Gaming Group**, caught mid-yawn during the early hours of August 16, 2025, when an unwelcome guest accessed its **internal systems**. Before you start panicking, they assure us: **no player data was touched**. Let that sink in — the real danger was to PowerPoint presentations and coffee machines, not your bankroll.

According to the corporate-friendly narrative (complete with PR-approved pacing), Bragg leapt into action faster than a cat startled by a cucumber. They called in outside cybersecurity experts, locked down the system, and — surprise! — operations rolled on as if nothing happened. No downtime, no drama, just business as usual.

So what’s the real headline here? Bragg joins the weekend club of **iGaming companies getting poked by cyber threats** — and keeping it quiet enough so nobody noticed. Other members include Flutter Entertainment (hello, Paddy Power and Betfair data snoops) and Merkur Entertainment (GraphQL fiasco). When one [iGaming software platform](https://www.softswiss.com/) after another gets dragged into security incidents, it’s hard not to wonder how many more “quiet weekends” are ahead.

**Clean governance? Kudos to Bragg for:**

* spotting the breach early (big win in “crisis bingo”);
* inviting pros to handle the mess;
* crafting a press release that reads: “No player’s wallet was harmed in the making of this statement.”

Let’s not break out the champagne yet. We still don’t know *how* they got in, *why*, or what their infrastructure looks like post-incident. Regulators might pop some questions. Investors? Raising eyebrows already. And anyone running an **iGaming software platform** should probably take notes.

1mvr4wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkoolStories/comments/1mvr4wj/jenna_monetized_her_free_community_without/,Jenna Monetized Her Free Community Without Selling Anything,"Here’s a simple way to bring in cash flow while you’re building your [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) community or running a free one.

Let people support you. Give them a clean way to gift you and fuel the mission.

In the $100M Playbook: Fast Cash, Hormozi explains that fast, ethical cash from your warmest audience beats waiting for “someday.” Most people want to support, they just need a button.

Here are two ways that you monetize while building or even in a free community.

**1) The first idea is similar to ""Buy A Coffee"".. or tea or little treat etc. 🎁**

The setup is easy:

* Create a new classroom as a Buy Now.
* Give it a name and description like Support the Mission or Buy Me A Coffee. Example: “If you’ve gotten value and want to support, your gifts help me keep building this community.”
* Set the price to something that is meaningful, but not too much. I go with $7, because it feels right.
* Put something inside the classroom as a Thank You! This could be a personal video, a bonus, or just something personal.

That's it. Super simple and allows people to give back if they want to.

This is what I've done in my Free community. Included a photo to show how simple it is and then the page inside is a Thank you page, fun facts, about me and an invitation for them to share about themselves in the community.

https://preview.redd.it/m2adfpqum8kf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=87e36af7f08a017e093aa077498ca2402f6aeb2a

**2) The second way is to let people become supporters of the community at one basic level or even at different tiers. 💪**

They may really appreciate what you’re doing and want to contribute more often. For now, you can set this up manually by offering multiple Buy Now classrooms (one for each tier). Later, when [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) releases subscription courses, you’ll be able to offer it as a true monthly option.

Here’s a simple tier setup you can use or inspire you:

* Supporter ($5): Thank you, just like the first option
* Champion ($19): Supporter perks plus a monthly upload into the classroom
* Patron ($49): Champion perks plus a monthly call together or early access to new content

You can even add an image to the About Page with a “Thanks to our supporters!” banner and showcase profile photos or a list of names. It makes people feel recognized and part of something bigger.

Your core community can stay free, or you can keep building it out together before monetizing. These options just give people a way to raise their hand and say, I believe in this, and I want to help it grow.

This only works if you create a place where people feel connected, supported, and part of something worth fueling. To me, that’s the best part, because it pushes you to build better.

# 40:03don't know what you're talking about. Well he just got told. So they use that

# 40:09to bust him on making a knowingly false statement because they told him what40:16he's there for. They trapped him into saying, ""I don't know what you want or I don't know what this is all about."" So40:23they convict him of that one. And then when they get the sentencing guidelines that kick in, they can use all the rest

# 40:30of the stuff under a civil standard of proof in order to enhance whatever40:37punishment the person would have otherwise gotten. So here we go loopde-loop. And what else we're looking40:44at is what's going on in New Orleans is what we're seeing in Atlanta, what we40:49see in New York, what we see in Chicago, what we see in Los Angeles, where the

# 40:56Blues have the opportunity to make where they are great, but they f it up because

# 41:02they're too doggone greedy, stupid, or they feel that they are above it all.

# 41:08And that's what you're running into. Baltimore has got these problems. You you name the city and you run into the41:16problems if certain interests run the city because they aren't the old41:22representatives who had the decency to say we are on the41:29front line. We are the tip of the spear. We're trying to get this stuff together41:35so everybody can have a just and equal opportunity to be an American. Now,41:42these people don't care. They just want the gravy. They look at political office41:48as a way to get wealthy themselves. And I'm not just talking about black folk. Look at Nancy Pelos.

# 41:55Yeah. It's all of them. It's all of all politicians. Um not all. Some of them. I sayity I say

# 42:03majority of the politicians majority I can't say all but the majority of politicians at some point if they they

# 42:10may come in corrupt but at some point they end up being corrupt they

# 42:15there you go they can't resist temptation right yeah too much I don't know if it's too much power too much access

# 42:22too much u blackmail too much deviant extortion

# 42:28it's see one thing the way it works here and I won't mention any names cuz some

# 42:33of them are old clients of mine or the current people or sons, daughters or

# 42:40grandchildren of former clients. But they get into that rainbow thing and

# 42:45they do the 6B bit that is unbuilt, drop bridges, drop boxes, bend over, spread

# 42:51butt cheeks, get boy banged. And what winds up happening is now they are initiated in the club. But they're also

# 42:59subject to blackmail because they can't come out of the closet, so to speak. So

# 43:05that's held over their heads. And when you get into what they're up to, you inevitably find that to be the

# 43:13situation. Somebody has been deviant in their sexual activity or excessive in it

# 43:22and they have bad histories that comes come out every now and then. Whether

# 43:27you're talking about Willis and Wade in Atlanta or whether you're talking about43:33uh what's going on elsewhere in the country. Uh you find that people engage43:39in schemes like Tish James who prosecutes Trump civily43:46for inappropriate uh reporting to a bank and defrauding a bank that says we43:52weren't defrauded. And then you find out she was doing the same thing and allegedly was listing her father as her44:01spouse to secure loans she allegedly wasn't entitled to. So, I mean, it's44:06just this big thing of a bunch of hypocrites that don't know any better because they've been raised as entitled,44:14pampered poodle brats. They are not used to paying for the44:19conse paying having consequences for what they do wrong. They can get away44:25with anything. And under Obama, under Biden, Harris, they've been given44:32a free pass by the use of prosecutorial discretion that exempts them from44:38accountability. So now somebody else is in the saddle. You've got a new sheriff and he's44:44saying, ""Uh-uh, ain't nobody getting away with this."" And they hate him. They badmouth him at every chance. And the44:51problem is is that they just been doing wrong. And it's like they've been taking penitentiary chances and not dealing44:58with it. And speaking of penitentiary chances, I want to say this again.45:04Section 8, title 8, excuse me, section 1324 of the United States Criminal Codes45:13makes harboring federal fugitives a felony. aiding, abetting, advising,45:19counsel, procuring, inviting, giving comfort, uh assisting in evading,45:28apprehension, detention, prosecution, deportation45:33of illegal aliens is a felony. And Mayor Bass has been engaging in it in Los45:40Angeles. Governor Nome in California has been engaging in it. Everywhere they set45:47up a sanctuary city, when you read the code sections, it's in clear violation.45:52They're not new laws. They've been on the books. They've been enforced over decades. And these ignorant somebody's46:00who feel special think they have a free pass to violate46:05these laws. And that is what is almost in place in Memphis here. They didn't46:11quite get there. and they ought to be thankful they didn't take those steps that could open them up to all being46:17prosecuted. We have had in Memphis's past, recent past, remote past, staying46:24after staying. The last one was Tennessee Walts where they caught all of these local officials corruptly taking46:32bribes under the table. We have had scandal after scandal. We've got a board46:37of education situation right now which is basically except for two me excuse46:43members all black and it is extraordinary46:50what you see when you get into looking at what they've done relative to46:55stealing taxpayers money or misappropriating funds. It is so bad47:00that the state is thinking of exercising extraordinary power and coming in and47:06taking over the operation. It is so crapped out the way it is being run here. And I live here.47:12We have had let's see in the last 6 months47:17one, two, three, four, five steak houses I go to used to like to go to have47:22closed down. One, two barbecue places have closed down. Let's see. Houston's47:28is closed up. We have no more TGI Fridays. We have no more family47:34restaurants of any note. You can't find a nightclub to go to cuz they've all47:40closed down. The streets are vacant at night because they Nobody wants to go47:46out and deal with the crime. The women are scared to go to a gas station and pump gas. Nobody wants to walk next door47:53to deal with the neighbors because of the crime. I live in the high rent district and on the street right down48:01the way from where I live, they had four shootings just a couple of weeks ago. A48:07half mile down the roadway, they've had five or six people shot, one fatally just in the last 18 months. Crime is48:15rampant in this place and nobody knows what to do. And these idiots, I guess48:20they're trying to diffuse or distract attention by saying uh there is somebody48:27else doing wrong, whether you're talking about New Orleans or whether you're talking about otherwise. And you notice48:35she had to have her full-time bodyguard who is allegedly her lover, but that's48:40not supposed to even be the issue. We don't care. They say who you deal with.48:45It's legit take public money. I and by the way, one little last thing. I want to badmouth this folk a little48:52more. Mayor Urkl will not go any place in this town48:57without five to eight uniformed cops as his bodyguards cuz he's scared to go49:03anywhere. The most ridiculous thing I've ever seen is I was in a bar, restaurant49:09bar walking out. A former fivetter mayor was in there. I was in there, a TV49:16celebrity and a retired criminal court judge. A former representative on the49:22federal level was in there. We were just talking with each other and here comes this clown walking in with five uniform49:30cops cuz he's scared to go where all these other people go because we49:36represented the people. He doesn't. There was 1749:42and it got elected by a scam. Now that's what we have.49:47All right, so let's move on. Well, yeah. But anyway, this is briefly this is briefly just a brief comment. Um Trump and Putin, they49:55met on Friday. Um and um they they did not take they had um they stood in front50:01of a podium in front of the press, but they did not take questions from the press. Um Putin, you know, he spoke,50:09Trump spoke. Of course, they had backdoor meetings and people, I guess, thought that their

# 50:16meeting was going to walk away with a solution and it wasn't so much a solution. However, you know, to have

# 50:23discussions to have an open forum between the two communications, they they were it was it was good and

# 50:30everything is headed in the right direction when it comes to this Ukrainian war with Russia. everything is

# 50:36headed in the right directions to have good communications um with Russia. And

# 50:41I don't even remember the last time a United States sitting sitting president

# 50:48met oneonone with the Russian president with the you know leader of Russia. So

# 50:54I do but it's been a while now. It's been a while. It's been a while. So um yeah. So they met in Alaska and I51:01think that was um perfect place more so um mutual grounds cuz we bought Alaska

# 51:06from Russia. Alaska's they sold it to us. Yeah. And then people were pointing out

# 51:12that the optics here that they had all these B2 bomber planes on the tarmac. So51:19it look very militarized but it's like why not? These are two powerful nations, United States and Russia. So, of course,

# 51:26you want to look like, yes, you have military bomber planes and so do I. You know, we're two great nations coming

# 51:34together where we are adversaries, but we're actually coming together to come

# 51:39up with a solution for for peace. So, what have you. So, this right here, we're looking at,

# 51:46President Trump is actually the most powerful person in the whole world. He

# 51:52has access to the codes. And you had a meeting between two of the

# 51:58three most powerful men in the world. Putin, Trump, the one that was not there

# 52:04was Zen Ping uh of China. So

# 52:10these are the people that have to be satisfied if anybody else in the world

# 52:16wants to do anything really. Now,

# 52:21the airhead idiots that think the world works on the 5 to 10 to 15 second sound

# 52:29bites they're used to are sadly misinformed and ignorant. It doesn't.

# 52:36There are lots of things that have to be worked out. This is a good step. And people are talking about Trump got

# 52:43embarrassed because nobody's been embarrassed. This is how it's worked

# 52:48out. Considering the confusion that's going been going on for decades, it takes time to straighten it out. The man

# 52:55on the left was a field operative for the KGB. He

# 53:01was a stone cold Russian counterpart, the 007 with a license to kill. He's

# 53:09personally killed people. Donald Trump is a billionaire. But what's interesting

# 53:15is Business Insider reports Putin's personal worth at $12053:21billion, not million. He's one of the richest people in the world. So you've

# 53:26got two people that don't need the corrupt government in order to stay rich. They already are. This man has

# 53:34held power in Russia practically absolutely for several decades. He knows

# 53:39the ins and outs. This other man over here has been involved in the fringes of

# 53:45politics as the man behind the throne. He is a senior citizen type who still

# 53:50has all of his wits about him. And the two of them know what they're doing. They'll make stuff happen. And it's

# 53:57about time somebody like that was in charge of world affairs. So one of the

# 54:03issues is bricks. Brazil, Russia, India, China, South

# 54:11Africa, and what they're trying to do to destroy the dollar is the almighty means

# 54:18of commerce in the world. And what's being done by Trump to protect the

# 54:23dollar from being displaced from that position. So this is a lot of power.

# 54:29These people have space programs. They have put people in orbit at the very

# 54:35least. They have intercontinental ballistic missiles and huge nuclear

# 54:40arsenals. Nobody else has that. Uh Russia has caught up with the United

# 54:46States in producing a cadre of non-coms

# 54:52and officers who have been tested in the heat of combat, shot at, wounded,

# 54:58survived, and proven themselves. So they are now back on the same level the

# 55:03United States was, which has had 30ome years of combat vets who run the

# 55:09military and they've been tested and they are rookies and amateurs. So these

# 55:17are the almighties. These are the ones that keep the planet Earth still

# 55:22habitable by humans. So give them a chance to do their thing and stop

# 55:28thinking of it like it's some little rainbow cult nonsense where you get to have some pride parade and you want

# 55:36satisfaction of how naked you can get on the float to be passed by the city

# 55:41council. This not what is going on here. So give it a moment. And also um Zalinski is coming back to55:49the white house today along with other EU leaders. um I guess to talk further

# 55:55about pursuing peace, right, to end the Russia Ukraine war. So, and it's about

# 56:02time like because Ukraine is not going to win, you know, just just give it up. Just

# 56:07they can't win, right? Because they are a civilized urban area.56:15They're not a jungle. They're not third world. Ukraine used to be the biggest56:21republic in the old Soviet Union. It's like Texas split off or Alaska.56:29Well, Alaska doesn't have enough people, but it's like if Texas left the United States.56:36Can you see if the Russians decided to say, ""Well, we're going to help Texas56:41stay separate from the United States. If the United States wants to take back56:47Texas, see that's how crazy it is. Now, the other thing is56:56what are you going to do when you're just posturing where you're making it a57:02little difficult? Hey, we'll we'll make this difficult. There's some other things we want to do. And by the way,57:08Ukraine, when you going to deal with uh George and uh Hunter, you know, that57:15broke all these laws and you have a huge RICO equivalent indictment against both57:21of them. Uh what are you going to do about that? See, this is the unsung stuff that everybody forgets about over57:28here that has to be dealt with diplomatically. I want to play this clip here. Um Mark57:34Rubio who is Secretary of Defense, right? No. Secretary of State. Secretary of State.57:40Secretary of State. State. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, first of all, Russians are already facing very severe consequences. There's57:46not a single sanction that's been lifted and not not one. I mean, they're facing all the same sanctions that have been in57:51place today. All the American support continues for Ukraine. And ultimately, look, if we're not going to be able to57:57reach an agreement here at any point, then there are going to be consequences. not only the consequences of the war continuing, but the consequences of all58:04those sanctions continuing and potentially new sanctions on top of it as well. But what we're trying to do right now is end the war. And in order58:11to end a war, you've got to give every opportunity that exists. You have to you have to be open to any opportunity that58:16exists to bring it about. And here's the thing to remind everybody and and when the president says this is not our war,58:22but let's be frank, this is not our war. The United States is not in a war. Ukraine is in a war and we've been supporting Ukraine. We are happen to be58:29in the role of the only country in the world with the only leader in the world that can actually bring Putin to a table58:34to even discuss these things. Now the president has traveled you know all the way to Alaska all the way back has58:40dedicated months and months of work him our entire team on this matter because we want to see an end to the war. But58:46but if tomorrow the war continues life in America will not be fundamentally altered. So I I think that we have to58:52understand is that this has been a priority for this president because he wants to promote peace. He wants to promote the end of a war. And I think we58:58should be happy that we have a president that's trying to promote peace and bring a war to an end.59:05You know, if they do have a nuclear exchange between the Ukraine and this uh Russia,59:11uh the debris and the radioactive material59:16gets up real high. It spreads through the atmosphere and it rains down on the59:23United States amongst other places. And the cows eat the grass that has been59:28rained on and the cows produce radioactive milk that won't go well with59:34your coffee or when they make ice cream out of it. So59:40we have a vested interest in keeping the world nuke free or at least not nuke free so much as uh59:49activated nukes. got an interest59:54Linski is at the White House today and I'm pretty sure it's going to go more1:00:01smoother than the last time he was there when he had to get G checked by Trump and JD Van. So I don't think he's going1:00:08to come he may come wearing a suit and he should. So I you know I think that1:00:14everybody needs to come to the table with a plan to end the war. I think it's1:00:19in everybody interest. And no, we're not in a war, but supporting Ukraine means we're still sending billions of dollars.1:00:26I think they stopped it, but still billions went there. And no, we need to stop funding them. You can support, but1:00:35you don't have to support by money. So anyway, I just wanted to add that. By the way, let me make one quick1:00:40comment. I think uh Secretary Rubio is doing a much better job than Madame1:00:47Hillary. Yeah. with that he honestly I got to admit yes1:00:53I didn't think he had it and I thought like why is he why is he nominating him that's that's a perfect role I think

# 1:01:00he's better at secretary of state than um as a senator however I think Colin

# 1:01:06Pal was a better secretary of state overall yeah Colin Pal got betrayed by that idiot George W Bush

# 1:01:14who was Barack's cousin and you Secretary of State. No, no. I'm sorry.

# 1:01:20I'm sorry. It was Condisa Rice who was Secretary of State. Colin Pal was Secretary of Defense.

# 1:01:26No, he was Secretary of State. He was Well, who was I thought Condisa

# 1:01:31Rice was like, ""Wait, let me look it up."" But anyway, here you go.

# 1:01:37Uh, the interesting thing about Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. He was Secretary of

# 1:01:44State under Bush Senior. Yeah. No, he was general uh in who was

# 1:01:51chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the highest rank an American military

# 1:01:57man can hold and was under Bush senior under Bush Jr.

# 1:02:03W. No, he became he was secretary of state. He was

# 1:02:12representing the United States as its most trusted representative until he got

# 1:02:17lied to by George W. Bush. It is clear

# 1:02:22and plain what happened. He said, ""Are you giving me your best honest

# 1:02:28information about these weapons of mass destruction being in

# 1:02:34Iraq?"" George W. assured him. Coen Pal relied on that representation

# 1:02:42and found it was a lie because what was going on is George W. Bush wanted to get

# 1:02:49the family company Hallebertton an end to taking control of the Iraqi

# 1:02:57oil industry which it did in 2007.

# 1:03:03And that's what the deal was. That weapons of mass destruction was a

# 1:03:08manufactured hoax on the world. And nobody's been held accountable for that.

# 1:03:15And George W. And Michelle giggle while

# 1:03:20he feeds her the candy. He used to feed her husband Barack when Barack was the

# 1:03:27kitty cousin that was colored that used to visit the Bush family home.

# 1:03:32Yeah, I'm sorry you Yeah, I stand corrected. Um I'm I got the Bushes. It

# 1:03:38wasn't senior. Colin Pal was Secretary of State under Bush Jr. for first and

# 1:03:46second and then Condisa came in midsec

# 1:03:51second term. Yeah, he resigned. I met Colon Pal. He was a real nice guy.

# 1:03:57I had a long conversation with him and his wife at a club one time in LA years

# 1:04:02ago. They didn't even dance. And before that I met him

# 1:04:07oh it must have been oh 30ome years before when I had a date

# 1:04:16whose brother was a military officer and they had a party celebrating his

# 1:04:21promotion to uh field rank. Well just real quick before we end cuz

# 1:04:28you know by the way I let me have one little crack at this one more. It's amusing. At

# 1:04:35least Rubio knows to have State Department business handled on the State

# 1:04:42Department uh excuse me uh email accounts.

# 1:04:48Hillary used to shop on the State Department uh email uh account and do uh

# 1:04:57you mean she state department she used department business through her personal email. She did state department

# 1:05:04business through personal email that she shopped on the state department

# 1:05:10she did. They alleged she did. Yeah, that's alleged allegations

# 1:05:16basically. But I want to say this. Well, I want to say this. I want to get off Rubio and I want to say this though about Carlin and Condisa because backto

# 1:05:24back, you know, George W. Bush is is listen, they were both black. They were

# 1:05:30both black and you've never seen that. And it's like

# 1:05:35it's not about that. And it was not a DEI hire. It was it was solely on merit

# 1:05:41and they were qualified probably overqualified. So you know well look

# 1:05:47they had a lot of those in the wood pile and in the round the family. Look at

# 1:05:53Barack Obama who is a cousin of the Bushes and his Barack's grandfather was

# 1:05:59first cousin to President George Herbert Walker. And so granddaddy is first cousins to

# 1:06:06President Bush one, second cousin to Bush, too. And Dick Cheney was a cousin.

# 1:06:13And Sarah Palin, the running mate of uh John McCain, who opposed Barack Obama,

# 1:06:21was a cousin. That's a little kind of strange, isn't it? One guy running against his cousin who

# 1:06:28is running for vice president who is a Democrat who is taking over from another

# 1:06:35cousin who is a Republican who had a vice president who was also a cousin.

# 1:06:42And Warren Buffett, the billionaire, is a cousin of this. Isn't that a nice little family affair?

# 1:06:51I guess that that's so sweet and we get caught all up in it and say, ""Hey, you know,

# 1:06:58why doesn't somebody just deal with the realities just put it in the lump sum?

# 1:07:03If you want to see it, it's still out there, but they've taken all of it off

# 1:07:08of Wikipedia and Google. You have to go look up through obscure sources. And the

# 1:07:14person is the ancestor and that is Samuel Hinckley. H I N C K L

# 1:07:25E Y Late of Cape Cod who is the ancestor to all of these guys.

# 1:07:31So here is the video. This is happening today. Right now, President Lzinski

# 1:07:38arrives at the White House for the summit with President Trump and European leaders. He doesn't have that military

# 1:07:44stuff on. He has all black, but it looks like it is similar to a suit. So, that's a little bit better. Um, and you know, I

# 1:07:51think this visit is going to run more smoothly than the last one. So,

# 1:07:56let me tell you what you're looking at here. See, this is unseen unless you know.

# 1:08:02See, Trump has on a custommade suit. I'm looking at the

# 1:08:09material and you can see some steels and when there is a slight pattern, it runs

# 1:08:15consistently from the shoulder through the sleeves. There's no break in it. In other words, it doesn't displace. That's

# 1:08:22the sign of a good suit. So, what's going on here is somebody saying, ""I can

# 1:08:27have on a $5,000 suit. I've got suits that cost $5,000, $6,000 to make uh

# 1:08:37years ago or even more recently. So, you've got on this multi,000 suit like

# 1:08:43in Jurassic Park where the guy says, ""My suit costs more than your education.""

# 1:08:49So, what happens is you can wear something like that. you can afford it.

# 1:08:54Where others might want to put on work clothes because they don't want to mess up a good suit. This is the little

# 1:09:03unstated thing which is something Obama got away from. I think the president

# 1:09:09should always be seen with a tie. Uh the tie is the last piece of body armor that

# 1:09:15men wear. The collar you see in the pictures of the people in the revolution

# 1:09:22or even during Shakespeare, they had the ruffle clown collar. That was to keep

# 1:09:28your corateed artery from being naked by a small sword, which was a good way to kill your opponent. So it was body

# 1:09:35armor. So that suit and tie bet represents the last bit of masculine

# 1:09:42body armor. the collar, leather necks, the Marine Corps to keep from getting a

# 1:09:48cutless cutting your throat or your neck. Okay, that kind of thing. So, it's a little subtle message in there. It's

# 1:09:56the uniform of diplomacy and worldwide power. And it doesn't make any difference what country you're in, what

# 1:10:02ethnic base you have. That's how you dress when you're dealing with power.

# 1:10:08And he's not. And with that, good show. That's the

# 1:10:13end. And um guys, please like, share, comment in the comment section below.

# 1:10:19And we will see you in the next video Thursday for Injustice for All with Judge Joe Brown.

Day 1 — Monday
I thought this was going to be easy. I’d read about Randy Gardner, the guy who stayed awake for 11 days back in 1964. I thought, if he could do it, so can I.

First day was fine. Coffee. Energy drinks. Adrenaline from excitement. My hands shook a little, but I felt alive.



Day 2 — Tuesday
24 hours in, my thoughts slowed down. I couldn’t remember why I walked into rooms. My phone buzzed, but I couldn’t process messages. My eyes burned.

I caught myself zoning out… but I wasn’t asleep. It was like my brain blinked without my permission. They call them microsleeps.



Day 3 — Wednesday
Somewhere around hour 60, things got weird.
I kept hearing clicking sounds in my apartment, soft, deliberate, rhythmic. I thought maybe my neighbor was doing something, but when I pressed my ear to the wall, the clicking stopped instantly.

I laughed it off… until I realized the “clicking” was my ceiling fan, which had been off the whole time.




Day 4 — Thursday
I looked in the mirror. My pupils were blown wide, and my eyes were red like I’d been crying for days. My hands wouldn’t stop trembling. I kept dropping things.

At one point, I swear I saw someone standing in the hallway. Tall, shadowy, motionless.
When I blinked, he was gone.



Day 5 — Friday
I don’t know how to explain this, but my thoughts stopped feeling like my own. My inner voice… it sounded different. Deeper. Slower.

I started writing everything down because my memory was shot. My handwriting looked like a drunk toddler’s. My body ached, and my chest felt heavy, like my heart was skipping beats.

I googled symptoms. Bad idea. Arrhythmias. Immune collapse. Neuron death. I should’ve stopped. But I didn’t.



Day 6 — Saturday
I woke up standing in my kitchen holding a knife.
Except… I hadn’t “woken up.”
I never went to sleep.

I dropped the knife, sat on the floor, and cried. Except, when I touched my face, my cheeks were dry. There were no tears.

That’s when I realized — my body had stopped producing them. My eyes felt like sandpaper.



Day 7 — Sunday
I’m hallucinating constantly now.
I saw a man crouched under my desk whispering to me in a language I didn’t know.
I saw bugs crawling under my skin. I clawed my arms until they bled.

Every time I blink, I’m not sure if I’ll open my eyes again.



Day 8 — Monday
I forgot my own name for about an hour.
I forgot where I lived.
I forgot why I was doing this.

I keep hearing a voice — “Just a little longer.”
I think it’s my voice.
I’m not sure anymore.



Day 9 — Tuesday
My heart hurts. My chest is tight. My left arm goes numb randomly. I think I’m dying.
But I can’t sleep. My body won’t let me.
Even when I close my eyes, I see flashing lights, screaming faces, shadows crawling along the walls.

I threw out all my clocks because time feels fake now.



Day 10 — Wednesday
There’s someone else in my apartment.
I hear him breathing.
I feel him watching me.

I haven’t slept in 240 hours.
My brain is shutting down. My hippocampus is probably fried, my immune system wrecked, and my heart feels like it’s about to stop.

I’m typing this on my phone with the little strength I have left.
If you don’t hear from me tomorrow…

1mvr2s0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvr2s0,"Same coffee, a different roaster, still amazing","So the S&W lychee co-ferment was one of my favorite coffees of this year! When I saw Black and White had the same one avaliable, it just had to be my next order from my subscription. 

The beans smell less weed like compared to the S&W roasting ones, from what my memory serves. As the coffee brews there is a faint weed smell, but overall very sweet and fruity too. The ground coffee itself is very pleasant smelling with the lychee up front. 

Upon the first sip, the coffee is very sweet and fruity. The aftertaste developed a lot and lingers for a long time, several minutes and it just wants to keep drawing you back. The after taste is very lychee like. The flavor profile isn't as powerfull as what I remember from S&W, but I am only 5 days past roast and anticipate the coffee will continue to develop over the next couple of weeks. Overall, I am very happy with this first cup, I might just have to buy a 2lb bag.... But, will it spro?

some logistics: i already have a full time job that i'm at three days a week, so this would just be a side gig for the other 3 days. ideally, i would only want to open this for the morning rush so 6am to around 11am from thursdays-saturdays. i was thinking of starting at my own apartment building and asking the building managers if i could operate from the lobby for tenants and then also ideally operate at a nearby hospital since it's very busy all the time.

the vision i have is really to just keep it simple: an espresso machine with a small refrigerator to store dairy products, limited flavors, and really sell my own unique flavors (i have had a home espresso machine for years so i've experimented a LOT).

i honestly don't even care to make a huge profit, the thought was to sell maybe 100-150 cups a day for those three days and just have a small side income, but really i just have been thinking of going into the coffee business for a long time now and am very passionate about it, so this seemed the best way to step foot into it since if all hell breaks loose, i'm not tied down to it and can just stop and have my full time job still.

any advice or thoughts would be appreciated on how to go about this, where to get started and what to expect :)",1,1755723199.0,foodtrucks,1,0.67,False

After the two men got my blood they went back into the drain. As I watched the footage on my laptop my phone rang it was number I didn't recognize, but a local area code.

“Hello” I answered

“Sequoya Creek” The voice on the other end said almost robotic.

“What about it? Who is this?”

“Sequoya Creek” It repeated

I hung up, and called Jacob! His phone rang with no answer it was early he was probably still asleep. I asked my dorm mate Mandy to come with me to check on him. “Why are you going to check on him after one call?” She said clearly annoyed I woke her. “He was sick last night so I just wanna make sure.” I said. “Then why do I have to go?” She said back starting to cover back up. “Cause I was gonna get coffee too, and figured you might wanna join.” I couldn't tell her its because I’m afraid. Mandy huffed but got up. We drove to Jacobs apartment just off campus. When we pulled in I didn't see his car in the lot. I went up to his apartment and knocked on the door at this point almost in full panic mode. His room mate Steven opened the door also clearly just waking up. “Mandy what are you doing here so early?” Steven asked me as he rubbed his eyes. “Where is Jacob he’s not picking up his phone?” I asked pushing my way into the apartment. “I thought he was with you. He never came in last night.” Steven said closing the door behind us. “Whats going on?” He followed up with clearly confused. “He wasn't with me last night.” Now in full panic mode I tried to call his phone again no answer. “Fuck…….his parents!” I said out loud Steven at this point feeding off my panic. “Hey what the hell is going on?” Steven stopped me grabbing my shoulders. “Ill show you.” Steven followed me out to my car. “Look I think me and Jacob have fucked up and got into something.” I told Mandy and Steven as we sat in the car. They both looked at me then each other in confusion. “What do you mean?” Mandy asked. “Into something?” Steven followed up. I pulled the camera out and showed them the footage. I had forgotten to warn them of the blood bath in it and watched as their faces twisted in disgust. “What the fuck April!” Mandy said as she turned away. “Keep watching just past this watch!” I said gesturing for her to turn back. I paused the video just after the two men left. “See what I mean we found something!” I said looking at the both of them. “Call the cops…..like now!” Steven said. “And tell them what I was trespassing near a clearly blocked off area?” I said annoyed that Steven even suggested that. Before he could respond I then told them about the call this morning. “Have you tried calling the number back?” Mandy asked clearly looking more and more freaked out. I hadnt even thought to call It back my mind went straight to Jacob. I dialed the number real quick and placed it on speaker. It rang twice then an automated voice came over saying the number had been disconnected. “Shit…….that means that whoever made the call knows about me and Jacob, but arn’t here to help. We have to go to Jacobs parents maybe he ended up there.” I said starting the car up. Jacobs parents lived between where we parked and his apartment maybe he went there sense it was late. “Whoa hold up I dont wanna go!” Steven chimed in from the back seat. “I dont know what you got going on, but based on that little footage you showed me and the call ill pass on getting involved.” He continued. “Yeah I dont think this is for me either.” Mandy said. I didnt give them a choice I floored it. The car took off and both of them lurched back! “What the hell April” Steven shouted. “Look just stick with me til I get to Jacobs parents then ill drop yall back off!” I said as we turned onto the road both of the realizing they didnt have a choice said fine and buckled up. We were almost to Jacobs parents when I saw something that made my stomach sink. Parked on the side of the road was Jacobs car. I screeched the car to a stop jolting Steven and Mandy forward. “Grab the camera!” I said as I jumped from the car. I ran over the Jacobs car and looked into it. It was empty it didn't look like anyone fought or anything. I opened the door and dug around looking for anything. Under his seat was his cell phone it was dead. “Hey looks like he had a flat!” I heard Steven call out from the back of the car. I got out and walked back to see. The back passenger side tire was flat. Looking closer at it though it was off it was flat but not like a leak, or a blow out. There was almost a perfect slice in the side of it. “It was cut.” I thought I had said in my head it wasn’t til Steven replied I realized I said it aloud. “How do you know? I get its a slice but to say it was cut is a bit of a stretch right?” Maybe he was right I don’t know why I was jumping to so many conclusions. I took a second to breath and compose myself. “Maybe you’re right he probably had the blow out and went to his parents.” I didn't see a phone charger in his car so if he had a flat while the phone was dead walking was the logical explanation. “Yeah like my dad use to say if ya hear horses dont go looking for zebra.” I heard Steven say. “Lets get back in the car and go to his parents we are almost there anyways.” Mandy said getting into the driver seat of my car. It only took us a few more minutes to get to his parents house their cars were there so that was good sign. At least it meant they were at home. I knocked on the door a couple times my hands fidgeting with anticipation. Finally after what felt like a lifetime Jacobs mom opened the door. “Oh April honey how good to see you! Jacob didn’t tell us yall were stopping by.” The last few words froze me! Jacob hadn't told her we were stopping by those words negated the need for me to even ask what I came to ask. “Oh...uhhhh….He isn’t with me he’s busy, and sense he knew I was in the area he wanted me to stop in for him.” I said thinking of any reason to not worry them. “Well thats sweet of him we are doing fine. Tell him it would be nice to see him though more then once every two weeks or so.” She said to me with a grin on her face. “Well come on in. Ill make us some breakfast you look like you’re starving.” She motioned me in the door. “Oh I cant stay actually just a drive by visit sadly. I've got some friends waiting for me in the car.” Before she could reply I turned and almost sprinted off the porch. I waved goodbye as I got in the car and watched as she closed the door with a confused look. “He’s not here.” I said as my voice begin to crack. I hit my dash hard when I heard a series of dings. I looked over and while we were driving Mandy had put Jacobs phone on my charger. I immediately picked it up to see several missed calls from me then also in his recent call list was the same number that had called me. Only it had called Jacob an hour after we had parted ways. He also had 1 text from the number it was a picture. As I opened it I dropped the phone once I realized what it was. Steven picked it up. “What is this? A hospital?” He asked as he showed the picture to Mandy. “Its the hospital I was in yesterday. Judging by the window its of Im guessing that was the room I was in.” I said at this point starting to lose composer. I was being watched this confirmed it, but who was watching me and why. “Whats the numbers under neath?” I heard Steven ask. “Looks like coordinates to me.” Mandy replied. I grabbed the phone and looked at them. I pulled up the maps app on my phone and put them in. Hoping that it would be something useful. It wasn’t in fact the location made me even more hopeless. “Well where is it?” I heard as I just stared at my phone. “Its…..its here.” As soon as the words left my voice Jacobs phone pinged again I looked back down. It was a picture of us! Me, Steven, and Mandy sitting in the car in the drive way. I looked up and looked at where the photo was taken. As my eyes darted around I saw them. “THERE!” I shouted as I pointed to the tree line that sat at the back of the field across the street. As Steven and Mandy turned the figure disappeared into the woods. I swung the door open and took off towards the woods. “WHERE THE FUCK IS HE!” I shouted as I ran. I was closing in on the field when I felt two arms tackle me to the ground. Steven had caught me and held me in place. I hit on his chest crying and begging him to let me go. “What are you gonna do if you had caught up to them?” As much as I hated it he was right. I wasn't a fighter If anything had I caught up the figure they would have just grabbed me too. Steven walked me back to the car and sat me in the passenger side. “Lets go back to Jacobs car and at least call a tow truck.” He said as we started back down the road. The ride was quite I was lost in my own emotions just looking at the window. We finally got back to where Jacobs car had been, but to our surprise it was gone. “Maybe a tow truck came and got it maybe someone else called.” Steven said I could tell trying to offer some reassurance. It was pointless cause I knew that isn’t what happen we all did. “I….I want to go back to the dorm.” Mandy said after being the most silent. “I dont know whats going on, and frankly at this point I think its for the better. I dont like knowing people are watching me!” She was starting to freak out which was fair. “Yeah….I understand you and Steven just drop me off at the police station please. Ill show them this phone, and let them handle it.” Jacobs phone pinged again another picture. This one finally broke me. It was a picture of Jacob strapped down to a steel looking table. Below the picture was a message. “You’ll keep your mouth shut.” Not only were we being followed but we were being listened to as well. All this just because I climbed a fence. This time I texted the number back begging it I wouldn't continue looking into the water and I wouldn’t say anything about all that's happened. I waited watching the three dots go. The reply was short and all it said was “Needed insurance.” I knew what that meant. It meant that Jacob wasn't coming back and If I so much as hinted at telling police or anything he was dead. A constant piece of insurance for my silence was what he was going to be.",1,1755723177.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It isn’t a protein-building amino acid, but it has unique effects on the brain. Things like smoother focus, fewer jitters, calmer mood. Personally, I like it with coffee in the morning as I find it makes the caffeine buzz much more stable.

I’ve been digging through [vendor lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mtxnb3/ltheanine_vendor_breakdown/), [Reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mp0gsv/ltheanine_is_life_changing/), and product reviews to put together what I think is the most complete guide to the best L-Theanine vendors on Reddit right now. I’m not claiming to be the most experienced person in this space, and so this ranking leans heavily on community feedback and tries to balance price, quality, and reputation.

# Quick Note on Suntheanine

Suntheanine is a patented form of L-Theanine made through a fermentation process that guarantees purity and consistency. That’s why it shows up in premium, NSF-certified brands like Momentous and Country Life.

Regular L-Theanine is usually synthesized or extracted from tea leaves. It’s way cheaper per mg but can vary in quality. Both forms work, but Suntheanine is more about trust and certification. Whether it’s worth the extra money comes down to preference.

# Vendor Highlights

* [Nootropics Depot](https://nootropicsdepot.com/search.php?search_query=l-theanine) – Best for bulk value. Most talked-about on Reddit. Not NSF-certified, but unbeatable price per mg.

* [NOW Foods](https://www.nowfoods.com/products/supplements/l-theanine-powder?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21485414362&gbraid=0AAAAADP6Oo3zeVFzhSNocohrZWuXIN73O&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnovFBhDnARIsAO4V7mA7hENXlbgaI9MzoRCvKJY_gyVJRZ4yokJ4wJYfO3g8Ps13Y_-YP_0aAmT3EALw_wcB) – Best starter option. Affordable and easy to find everywhere.
* [Doctor’s Best](https://www.doctorsbest.com/products/doctor-s-best-l-theanine-150-mg-90-veggie-caps-12959) – Solid mid-tier. Reliable, though not Suntheanine.
* [Swanson ](https://www.swansonvitamins.com/p/swanson-ultra-double-potency-suntheanine-l-theanine-200-mg-60-veg-caps)– Best budget-friendly choice. Decent quality but not premium.
* [Vitacost ](https://www.vitacost.com/premier-research-labs-l-theanine?ta=l-%2btheanin&t=l-%2btheanine)– Convenient for online shoppers, but nothing standout.
* [BulkSupplements ](https://www.bulksupplements.com/products/l-theanine-pills?srsltid=AfmBOoqzrxRmapbUruKifSptVDF087D4Q7VxzCwiqWJ5tPsulwvvKmtj)– Best for raw bulk. Insane value, minimal testing/branding. Mixed reviews on quality.
* [Healthy Origins](https://healthyorigins.com/products/l-theanine-100mg?srsltid=AfmBOopTaHVFJVoet-o1T5Cv9aZbwQEqGYeqRBVpwIUZTxHaK_jSQuop) – Best for mid-tier but doesn’t stand out.
* [Pure Encapsulations](https://www.pureencapsulationspro.com/l-theanine.html?size=120%20capsules) – Best for clinical settings, but overpriced.
* [Thorne’s Formula](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/theanine) – Same as Pure Encapsulations: premium branding, weak value.
* [Natural Factors](https://naturalfactors.com/products/stress-relax-l-theanine-100-mg?srsltid=AfmBOoqWRbJ19teEzXtYNHlgn7EDJGrhP47sbPwwHGQddAGSjepvcHCJ) – Lowest value here and not well-regarded.

# Wrap Up

That’s my breakdown, but this list isn’t set in stone. Some people swear Suntheanine feels cleaner, others say generic works just as well.

Would love to hear from people who:

* Have tried both Suntheanine and regular. Did you notice a difference?
* Have a go-to vendor you recommend.
* Know of any good vendors I might’ve missed.

1mvqxql,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1mvqxql/opening_a_coffee_cart/,opening a coffee cart,"as the title suggests, i'm thinking about opening a small mobile coffee cart in jersey city and was wondering if people had any advice or suggestions?

some logistics: i already have a full time job that i'm at three days a week, so this would just be a side gig for the other 3 days. ideally, i would only want to open this for the morning rush so 6am to around 11am from thursdays-saturdays. i was thinking of starting at my own apartment building and asking the building managers if i could operate from the lobby for tenants and then also ideally operate at a nearby hospital since it's very busy all the time.

the vision i have is really to just keep it simple: an espresso machine with a small refrigerator to store dairy products, limited flavors, and really sell my own unique flavors (i have had a home espresso machine for years so i've experimented a LOT). 

i honestly don't even care to make a huge profit, the thought was to sell maybe 100-150 cups a day for those three days and just have a small side income, but really i just have been thinking of going into the coffee business for a long time now and am very passionate about it, so this seemed the best way to step foot into it since if all hell breaks loose, i'm not tied down to it and can just stop and have my full time job still.

any advice or thoughts would be appreciated on how to go about this, where to get started and what to expect :)",3,1755723038.0,barista,4,0.71,False

1mvqvrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1mvqvrl/explore_whether_the_lenovo_v15_business_laptop_is/,Explore Whether the Lenovo V15 Business Laptop Is Worth the Hype,"Testing the Lenovo V15 felt like stepping into a well-oiled machine crafted with everyday functionality in mind. Designed to cater to professional tasks and general computing, this laptop strikes a unique balance between performance, storage, and usability. As I ran through a day packed with Zoom meetings, browser tabs, and a bit of Netflix during lunch, I noticed several thoughtful touches Lenovo integrated into the V15 series.

**Powerful Performance for Everyday Needs**  
The Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processor with its 4-core setup really exceeded my expectations for an entry-level laptop in this category. Clocking speeds from 1.1 GHz to 3.3 GHz, it handled multitasking smoothly. Opening multiple applications, from Chrome to Microsoft Word and even light Photoshop work, barely dented its performance. Pairing this with Intel UHD Graphics allowed me to enjoy casual streaming and basic visuals without any lags. This isn’t the machine for hardcore gaming, but for daily tasks and light entertainment, it gets the job done.  

**Generous Storage and Memory Setup**  
One of the things that immediately stood out was the whopping 40GB DDR4 RAM paired with a 1TB PCIe SSD. This memory setup screamed ""future-proof,"" making it ideal for individuals like me who juggle large files or need a responsive experience. Moving files and booting the system felt like a breeze; there was virtually no delay throughout my testing. Honestly, knowing I don't have to invest in external storage for years is a massive plus for someone constantly working with large documents.

**Sleek Design Built for Portability**  
What caught my eye while unboxing the product was its sleek, minimalist design. The black PC-ABS chassis looks professional and feels durable; it’s one of those laptops you wouldn’t mind pulling out during a client meeting or in a coffee shop. At just 3.75 pounds, despite its 15.6” frame, it didn’t weigh me down when I carried it around for the day. The anti-glare FHD screen was another welcome feature, especially during late-afternoon sunlit moments in my living room. Colors felt adequate, though if you’re directly comparing it to top-tier laptops, there’s room for improvement in brightness.  

**Enhanced Connectivity and Seamless Security**  
Ports, glorious ports! Living in a world where USB-C is everywhere, it was a relief to see that this machine supports USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 alongside the more traditional USB 2.0 and USB 3.2 Gen 1 options. Using the HDMI 1.4b port to hook this laptop up to a secondary monitor was straightforward and stable. It even includes an RJ-45 port for Ethernet users who prefer reliability over Wi-Fi. Speaking of Wi-Fi, thanks to Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, browsing speeds felt more consistent and slightly faster compared to older laptops I’ve tested.  

When it came to security, Lenovo kept up with privacy demands. The built-in physical shutter for the HD webcam is a small but thoughtful addition for someone like me who often has the ""camera always on"" paranoia. Additionally, the Windows 11 Pro setup, paired with Firmware TPM 2.0, made login and secure data handling nearly effortless.  

**Impressive Audio and Video Features**  
Stereo speakers with Dolby Audio technology definitely punch above their weight here. I ran a quick YouTube playlist test, and the audio surprisingly filled my bedroom with decent clarity. Spoken words during video calls were crisp, though bass-heavy tracks felt slightly hollow at higher volumes. The HD webcam is functional, with an adequate 720p resolution, but low-light scenarios could’ve been better supported—it’s not ideal if your workspace lacks proper lighting.  

**Highlights**  
- Ample storage and RAM for years of usability  
- Lightweight, professional design paired with a decent anti-glare display  
- Robust connectivity options, including USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet  
- High-quality Dolby Audio performance for casual media use  

**Shortcomings**  
- Brightness levels on the display could have been better.  
- Webcam quality isn’t great for darker or low-lit environments.  
- Not suited for resource-heavy tasks, such as gaming or advanced graphics work.  

**Other Options Worth Considering**  
I couldn’t help but compare this to similar business laptops I’ve encountered. A direct competitor is the Dell Inspiron 15, which excels in its vibrant screen quality and slightly better audio output. However, Dell's machine often underdelivers on storage and multitasking capabilities in its base configurations. On the flip side, laptops like the HP Pavilion sit in a similar price tier but lack the versatility of Lenovo’s port selection. Lenovo V15 feels like that dependable middle-ground product—it may not woo you with premium features, but it offers solid productivity specs where they count.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Given its specs and features, I’d classify the Lenovo V15 as excellent value for money. While other laptops in its range often barter RAM or storage to cut costs, this one comfortably tackles essential business needs without compromising. Yes, some areas demand slight sacrifices, like display brightness and webcam performance, but the overall package justifies its price for anyone seeking an everyday workhorse. Pairing sleek portability with impressive storage at this price point is rare and makes the model hard to ignore.

1mvqust,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1mvqust/was_this_an_avoidant_discard_or_just_a_total/,Was This An Avoidant Discard? Or Just A Total Mindfuck?,"**TL;DR:** four months ago, my boyfriend of two years abruptly discarded me in a frantic, cruel ten-minute phone call while dealing with unmanaged depression and overwhelm from a lot of other life stressors, and we haven't spoken or seen each other since. We were talking about moving in together and next steps and really never fought, so I had no idea anything was even wrong and I'm not sure anything really *was* prior to the deactivation and discard. There was no chance for repair or conversation--just an abrupt dumping by phone and then he's mostly disappeared since. We're both in our late 30s/early 40s so there's a lot of context that feels important--his ex-wife, their 18 year marriage that ended in her having an affair, and his kids, plus my learning that I'm unlikely to be able to have a kid of my/our own--but lately I'm second-guessing whether this was an avoidant discard or just a really shitty, blindsiding breakup with no conversation, chance of repair/empathy/compassion, or closure.

\- - -

**Long version:** I've been quietly following this subreddit for some time, ever since what I believe to be my avoidant discard by my partner in early May, and I can't tell you all what a tremendous resource this has been for my learning and my healing. I'm really hopeful I won't find myself in a situation like this one ever again, in large part to understanding the avoidant cycle and the way our dynamic activated within me an anxious attachment, despite a lot of healing work I'd done around being more secure. (I think I *was* secure for a long time!) Quietly lurking here and following other's stories seemed to be doing it's thing for me for a while, but lately I've begun to second-guess myself (second wave of grief?) and whether or not this was an avoidant discard or if I simply got dumped in a really weird, abrupt, blindsiding and shitty way and I'm telling myself a story to feel better. It's a long and sort of nuanced story (see: his longterm marriage, ex-wife's affair, my infertility), but I'd so appreciate any insights anyone might have, because holy moly, what a mindfuck.

So: prior to what I believe to be an abrupt discard in early May, I was with my  boyfriend for nearly two years, and on the whole, it was a really healthy, happy, deeply committed, and communicative relationship, such that I didn’t really even recognize his avoidant attachment style until a year into the relationship, and even then, it only showed up a handful of times in the year that followed. Even now, I’d say he wasn’t *severely* avoidant, but the abrupt discard seems to point to something different.

Here’s our backstory: we matched online two years ago but were both traveling consecutively for end-of-summer vacations, so our online conversations built for about three weeks before we could actually meet in person. In the interim, we shared a lot about our lives, and this level of connection and honesty was really refreshing and made me want to be upfront with him that I had spent the last two months trying to have a child on my own (with donor sperm) because I really wanted to be a mother and, at 36, I worried my time was running out. I told him I understood that wasn’t something most men would want to be a part of, and I would understand if he didn’t want to meet up, but I felt an obligation to be honest and I didn’t want to waste his time if that wasn’t something he was open to. He said that while he had questions and wanted to learn more, he also still very much wanted to meet me, and once we met in person, we realized just how much our compatibility and chemistry extended into our face-to-face interactions, as well. We began dating exclusively pretty soon thereafter (I don’t think either one of us was talking to other people at the time, because we’re both ‘one person at a time’ kind of people, but we had the ‘exclusivity’ conversation a month or so in).

We both came into the relationship with a bit of trauma: I had been in an abusive partnership that ended three years prior and hadn’t dated much since (I was very content doing my own thing, which is also why I had begun trying to have a child on my own, as I’d always wanted to be a mother and worried that my time was running out or that I’d try to rush something if I did meet someone I liked, which would create added pressure), and he was two years divorced from a woman he’d been married to for eighteen years (childhood sweethearts who eloped at 19) and with whom he had two kids, a 7-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl. The reason their marriage had ended, as he explained it to me, was that she had had an emotional (and possibly physical) affair with a woman she met at work, and she’d asked for a separation, but during that trial separation, she’d continued pursuing this relationship, and so he was the one to insist upon their divorce. He’s a really progressive man and didn’t harp too much on the fact his wife had had an affair with a woman, but I know it had an impact on him, likely in a way that made him feel insecure about his masculinity. She and her girlfriend are still together, and they moved in together about six months into our relationship.

Then and up until my discard, he was everything I was looking for, honestly, and I think I was everything he was looking for, too. We had a lot of shared interests and goals, liked to do the same stuff and spend our time in the same ways, and in general, he was the most compatible person I ever dated. He also told me often how thrilled he was to have met me, because we had a compatibility he hadn’t felt before, since his only other really longterm partner was his wife of eighteen years, whom he married in his late teens and before their personalities had really developed. He told his sister and mom and friends about me and then I *met* those people, going on camping vacations or spending time together over the holidays, and they all loved me and told me how good it was to see him happy again. I know they felt as we did: that we were really compatible and healthy for one another and it was great to see us together.

Our relationship built steadily from there. I met his children about three months in, and although he told me his daughter was really shy and not to take it personally if she didn’t really interact, she did—both kids took to me immediately and I assumed, over time, a step-mother like role, going to all their concerts and plays, putting them to bed some nights, getting them on the school bus some mornings, staying home with them when they were sick, taking them out for meals when their dad had to work, and otherwise just being really present for them. I lived an hour away, but after the first year, I was able to get a great job in their same town, so I spent the night three or four nights a week, often on weekends so we could all do things together. In the first six months, at my friends’ and therapist's suggestion, I tabled the process of trying to have a baby on my own, because I valued what I’d found with my partner and how much I loved his children. Their mother—my partner’s ex-wife—was very much in the picture and a great mom, and over time, she and I became friends, as well, and I was able to help my partner and her find more common ground and pursue a healthier dynamic between them despite the affair. 

On the whole, I was really mature and evolved about their co-parenting relationship. I never inserted myself unnecessarily into the dynamic and I trusted them to be alone for co-parenting meetings about schedules and schoolwork. My friends and even my therapist said I was handling things in a really mature way. But I began to notice the way that these one-on-one “scheduling meetings” to discuss the kids sometimes impacted my partner; he’d come home from them and be cold or detached from me, and once, he’d even had her over to their former martial home, where he still lived—they usually met at a neutral place, like a coffee shop or restaurant—and this especially impacted him, because as he told me later that week, it was emotionally difficult to have her in the home where they’d lived together, discussing their kids like good parents and getting along so well, and it made him wonder, *How did we fuck this up so much?* I was really glad he felt he could be transparent and open up to me, and my therapist especially stressed that it was a super healthy sign that he felt comfortable telling me this, but I’ll be honest that it almost made me feel insecure and my only worry in our relationship was that she would realize she’d made a mistake and want him back, and he would miss her enough to go back to her because of their shared history and kids. He was off for five or six days because of that evening, and I tried not to take it personally—it makes sense to me that it would create a sense of nostalgia and sadness, not just for himself but for his kids, who I know he thought deserved united, happily married parents—but I also felt sad that their coparenting relationship (and lack of boundaries, maybe?) was impacting our relationship. Still we were able to move through that together, and while I suggested erecting some boundaries about where and how they met to discuss coparenting as a way of protecting himself and us, he never established any, and I just tried to be cool and understanding and supportive (in retrospect, I wish I’d been firmer about asking for these boundaries, because I think it would’ve either protected us or caused the discard to come sooner).

A little over a year into our relationship, I broached the topic of having kids, and he was honest that he wasn’t sure it was something he wanted. His youngest was nine by then, and he said it was nice to finally experience some freedom again—he could go to the grocery story and leave him at home with his older sister, for example. He’d also had a vasectomy after his son’s birth, nine years prior, and I was almost 38, so we didn’t know if it was physically possible. He agreed to come with me to a fertility specialist to talk about options—an “information gathering session,” I called it—but after an ovarian assessment, the doctor relayed that I had very little time (low egg count when ovulating) and we would need to pursue a sperm aspiration for my partner and IVF, both of which were costly and necessitated pretty quick action. Neither one of us has $25k floating around, and my partner said he wasn’t ready to move forward with having a child with me after only a year together, which I understood. I hadn’t wanted to do IVF, either, and had hoped to do something more natural, so all of this began to point to the fact that I wouldn’t have a biological child of my own, and while I was clear that I really loved being in his children’s lives and increasingly loved them like my own, I was also so disappointed at the knowledge I’d never experience pregnancy or having a child of my own. Briefly, about an hour after the appointment, I said, “I just feel like if I still have a chance to make this happen, I should try, because I’m the one that will have to live with this decision if we break up and I lose you and the kids.” I wish I hadn’t said this out loud, because it was what my therapist called “live processing,” but I did and I think it really hurt him and made him feel like I’d resent him if I didn’t try. I apologized almost immediately and said I was just really confused and overwhelmed, and he tried to listen and be attentive, but I could tell he was shutting down, and in the days that followed, while I grieved pretty heavily (I was sick to my stomach with grief and couldn’t stop crying), he asked for time to be alone to process his feelings, and I didn’t hear from him for five days. This was a layer of grief on top of grief, and it was my female friends who sat beside me as I heaved and cried and threw up, which I later wrote in my journal felt pretty unforgivable. In retrospect, I think he felt bad he wasn’t ready to have a kid with me, bad he couldn’t afford IVF, and bad that he was possibly keeping me from a thing I’d always wanted and that I’d resent him for it later, even though I expressed none of this was the case.

Eventually, we were able to amend, which largely happened as a result of some pretty big concessions on my part. He reached out on day six of silence to ask if we could talk on the phone, and during that phone call, he told me that we needed to work on our communication skills (?) so that in the future, we could find our way through moments of conflict and crisis like that. I didn’t really understand, because if anything he took five days away from me during arguably the hardest part of my life (so why is he coming to me about communication?), but I was so relieved he wasn’t breaking up with me and that I wouldn’t lose him and the kids, as well, that I didn’t push it and try to engage deeper. I was so scared I’d lose him and the kids *and* my ability to have a kid on my own, and the whole thing made me realize how much I considered him and his children my family, regardless of any biological lineage or legal union. I later learned he spent those five days alone mostly drinking, smoking pot, and even doing mushrooms in his friend’s garage—something my own friend told me was “loser behavior,” even though she liked him and thought we were good together, because she was really disappointed how he’d let me down and abandoned me during my time of grieving, and I’ll admit I remained really hurt about that, and about the fact that he was doing mushrooms while I was crying about my infertility. 

We more or less buried all of this and moved on, which I didn’t love, but I also was nervous to speak up or try to process it or tell him how much it hurt for him to ghost me when I was grieving because I worried he’d break up with me. I regret this now, obviously. A few months later, he asked if I’d be open to moving in together with him, and I was thrilled. We met with realtors but unfortunately learned we weren’t in the right financial place yet to buy. He was renting and I owned my own home but was nervous to sell outright (I wanted to rent it and use that income for our mortgage), but we didn’t have enough for a downpayment, and that felt like another blow. 

I don’t know that we ever recovered from that. Worse, we both entered a period of incredible professional stress. I’m a professor who experiences the busiest month of the year in April, right before graduation, with evening events and celebrations on top of an increase in work and meetings, and he is an arborist who enters heavy planting season in the spring, which sometimes means planting a dozen or more trees a day (really hot and physically-demanding work). His son had also been sick a lot all fall and winter, and the boy’s teacher was frankly pretty cold and made him and his ex-wife feel like bad parents for not sending him to school even when he was sick. She made them feel a lot of shame and like they weren’t doing a good enough job to keep him healthy. At the boy’s doctor’s suggestion, they began to pursue a diagnosis, ultimately having their son scoped at the local children’s hospital, and during this appointment—while getting coffee during the procedure—my partner’s ex-wife mentioned that she and her girlfriend were on the rocks and she sort of regretted having her move in. Again, my boyfriend came home and told me this, which I do find comforting (that he felt capable of talking to me about this), but again, his demeanor towards me and in general changed, and he became pretty cold and detached. He still sent me really sweet texts every morning and at night, and he was consistent in some ways, but his in-person demeanor really changed and he became pretty cold and detached from me. My birthday came and he was out of town with some friends, which he had apologized for, but when he got back, he gave me my gifts and while I don't care much about gifts or material items, they all lacked any sense of love or knowing me. I got an olive oil sprayed and a pair of salad tongs. He also knows words of affirmation are my love language and that I really love it when he expresses anything in writing--a card, a note--but instead he gave me a Post-It note that said, ""I know you love birthday cards but I forgot so here's this Post-It note."" That was it. Literally. It hurt more than anything. I tried to bring this up with him a few days later, but he said my expectations were so high he always felt like he was failing them. I internalized this, but in retrospect, I'm mad at myself for feeling this way. I was fine with him missing my birthday to go on a boys' trip, but it really bothered me that when I asked if in the future he would take the time to write me a birthday card, even if it was on a folded piece of blank printer paper,  he said I expected ""too much.""

A few days later, his son's results came back and proved that his son had pretty severe Celiac’s Disease, which meant not only a whole new diet (difficult for a nine-year-old), but the need to buy all new pots and pans, because his son was really sensitive to any lingering gluten remnants on existing cookware. My boyfriend was really stressed about all of this, and I tried to be supportive—I bought a lot of gluten-free food items and even researched apps that help identify “gluten-free friendly” restaurants and bakeries nearby, even bringing everyone home a gluten-free pastry one evening after work—but increasingly, he began to shut down and deactivate. One night, I asked if he even wanted me to come over like I’d planned, or if he needed some time alone (I knew he valued independence and alone time and I worried he wasn’t getting enough of it, even though I considered it his responsibility to communicate that need), because sometimes when I was there, it didn’t seem like he even liked me, and that made me feel rejected and hurt my feelings. He was taken aback but later told me he appreciated that I was honest with him; he said at the time, he didn’t like it, because it felt like getting called out, but also that it wasn’t personal—he assured me, “I like you very much, baby,”—and he could tell he wasn’t acting like himself lately or like he liked *anyone,* that he felt off-center and not like himself, and he didn’t know how to fix it. He thanked me for telling him and said he’d do better. I told myself he was just going through some depression--he had admitted to experiencing it in the past, and we'd both acknowledged April could cause some malaise and sadness in both of us individually--and I decided I'd keep an eye on it and try to encourage him to get some additional mental health support if it continued.

Instead, a few days later, my discard. It started on a Friday night, when I came over after work with a homemade gluten-free cake I’d made from scratch for us all to enjoy, because he had the kids that weekend and it was the first weekend of May, warm and sunny and finally spring. My partner was not enthused, however, and instead was drinking beer solemnly in his garage when I arrived. The kids were excited about the cake and wanted to watch a movie that night, so I said we could probably do that, but again my partner was cold and detached. I told him I could take the kids to the grocery store to pick out a fun drink, mostly thinking he could use some time to himself, but when we got back, we was still pretty distant. He said he didn’t feel well and went to bed early, so I cut the cake for the kids and cleaned up and put the kids to bed. The next morning he was still really cold, so I asked him if he wanted me to go to be alone, and he looked at me and sneered and said, so coldly it still breaks my heart, “Yeah, kinda.” The coldness with which he said this and the lack of communication or compassion around it made me begin to cry, so I left pretty quickly and without saying goodbye to the kids, because I knew it would upset them to see me cry and they’d want to know why I was leaving when the plan was for me to stay and spend the weekend. He never called or messaged the rest of that day or night, and the next morning, he texted only to say that he was sorry he hurt my feelings, but he was really overwhelmed and ""there was no kind way to ask someone to leave.” Then he said that what I needed to understand was that when I brought a cake over and made plans with the kids to watch a movie, I was “inviting a party” into his house, and I was inviting something he did not necessarily want or consent to. He said that his house was his place to decompress and recharge, the same as my house is mine, and that I needed to understand that he had every right to say what was and wasn’t okay in his own house. Obviously I agree with all of this, but the idea that my crime was that I’d made a gluten-free cake for his son and told his daughter we could watch a movie feels petty and mean and like he was projecting, trying to find something to blame me for. He asked when I was free that night to talk on the phone, and a few hours later, when he called, it was an absolute avoidant discard by phone, a frantic ten-minute call I stretched to twenty minutes because I knew from the tone in his voice that after we hung up, that would be it, and I wouldn’t get any more understanding or closure. During this call, he was completely deactivated and cold, cruel, lacking empathy and any level of compassion or generosity, which was really hurtful but also signaled to me he was utterly deactivated. There was no conversation or identifying problems that we could work on—it was just a total discard, and he couldn’t seem to get through it fast enough. He told me that it wasn’t that he hadn’t enjoyed our time together or that he didn’t enjoy my company, but that he “couldn’t do this” and that he was really overwhelmed with our two schedules, our two homes, even though we’d been still trying to figure out how to move in together through renting a place together. In one of his more telling lines, he said that he was “really good at this at the start” (communicating? showing up for me? being emotionally intimate?) but that he just couldn’t do it anymore. I was fairly calm, all things considered, and told him that I loved him—to which he said he loved me, too—and then I asked him if he was sure about this, because once he did it, he couldn’t undo it. He said, “I’m sure.” Finally, I told him that it seemed like he was just overwhelmed by everything going on in his world, and then the larger world (we’re both very liberal and frightened of Trump), and that he as just throwing me away because I was the only thing that was discardable—he couldn’t discard his kids or job or the larger world or his coparenting relationship, which sometimes felt emotionally difficult to navigate, but he could throw away me. And to this he said, “I don’t know, Amy. Maybe. Maybe.""

Then we hung up and I immediately went No Contact. I didn’t post anything online for three weeks, nor did he, but as I began to post small things about my life unrelated to him, he began to like and even ‘heart’ them, which felt confusing (this is when I found this subreddit and began to learn what ‘breadcrumbing’ was, among other things). He liked my things online for a few weeks, but we still hadn’t had any interaction in real life, and he hadn’t texted or called to communicate any further, and it began to feel really hard on my heart to see him interacting with me online like we were on fine terms when his discard had been so cold and hurtful. In mid-June, I unfollowed him and removed him from my followers, and while I have a public account, he hasn’t viewed any of my stories since (and I don’t think he’s using burner accounts). Shortly thereafter, at my therapist’s suggestion (because she worried that 'foot in the door' with the unreturned items and keys was giving me hope he'd reconcile with me, and in her own words, *hope prevents healing*), I initiated the return of our stuff and our spare keys by messaging him to say—assertively but not unkindly—that I would drop his stuff off in his driveway while he was at work and the kids were at their mom’s; he messaged back to say he had the kids that day after all because she was traveling but that I should “let myself in” and that he was “sure the kids would be really excited to see \[me\]” and that my stuff was in the basement and I was welcome to collect it. This kindness and invitation to see the kids threw me off, but I knew I couldn’t see them without crying and getting upset, and I also knew I couldn’t be the adult in the situation and explain—when they inevitably asked what happened—that sometimes things don’t work out and that doesn’t mean there’s not a lot of love still there. I couldn't be the adult and help them process this, because I didn’t feel that way; I felt like I’d been abandoned entirely by the person I loved, by my best friend and partner and with whom I was building a future with, and that discard had been really cold and cruel and mean, lacking any empathy or compassion. I told him that it sounded like that day wasn’t the best fit, and that I would try the following week, and he said, “Okay, whatever is easiest.” The following week, he messaged to say he’d left my stuff out for me and that he was “truly very sorry about everything” and that “it hurts here too.” I don’t know what “it hurts here too” means—his heart? the kids?—but I told him that I didn’t feel like it did hurt, that I was truly very baffled by how he’d executed all of this, and that it hurt very much that he’d completely thrown me out without a conversation and without any empathy, without any compassion. He just texted back, simply, “You’re right. I’ll own it. I fucked it up.” I took “it” to mean the way he broke up with me, not our relationship, and the nonchalant way in which he said this really hurt so I didn’t say anything back, but a few hours later, I said that if he ever wanted to have a conversation, he knew where to find me, and that I’d be living and working in his town that following week (I’d rented an apartment because I was working a festival with very long days and had planned to stay with him, but since our breakup, I wanted to avoid commuting). He never responded, and there's been no communication whatsoever since. No breadcrumbing, either.

I had bought his kids several weeks in advance a really nice double hammock to surprise them with on the last day of school, and it didn't feel right to return it or sell it, so when I went to get my things, I built the hammock and left a small card with his kids' names on it. The note said, really simply, ""I bought this for you both to celebrate the last day of school and a summer of relaxing and reading and hanging out in this hammock. It's big enough for you both! I am so proud of you both and hope you have a really relaxing summer."" No mention of my ex-boyfriend or our splitting, but just a lot of love. My therapist said it was really sweet and thoughtful and she took no issue with it, which I'm glad for. But again, I never heard anything about it (or anything).

Suffice it to say: all of this has been such a mindfuck. It’s been so hurtful and I have felt utterly discardable, even as I work to process the breakup and how it is not a reflection of me or us. I was all in, ready to commit to him forever because I genuinely loved him and what we had. I can look back now and see the way he abandoned me during my grief as a red flag, but I struggle to find any more, and I chalked that up to his fear of abandonment and the trauma from his ex-wife. But I might be giving him too much credit. And it still really hurts so much to know how easily he removed me from his life and how little he seems to feel about it. He had demonstrated himself to be an avoidant attacher (dismissive, I think?), and I definitely ran anxious especially in the second half of our relationship after he took space from me during my grieving, but I also never expected to be discarded like this, and every day that goes by feels harder and harder for me to accept that this is really it, it’s over, he’s not reaching out or working to apologize or take accountability, and that “it truly hurts here” and “I’ll own it, I fucked it up” is probably all I’ll ever get from him. It’s uncharacteristic of him, but it’s made me think a lot about the affair his ex-wife pursued and whether or not it was instigated by his emotional detaching. A month or so in, she reached out to express her apologies at hearing that we’d split up and told me she’d still really like to maintain our friendship, and eventually, I asked if she'd be comfortable sharing if this is how he’d been to her: emotionally distant, shut down. She said that yes, she often felt as though she lived her life beside his, not with him or together, and that while she often asked him if they could go to therapy, he never wanted to, so eventually she stopped asking. She said it didn’t excuse her infidelity, but she implied that it made her seek out emotional intimacy elsewhere, and that she was really hopeful he was being a more emotionally present partner for me, and that she was really sad when she'd heard we ended. For his part, I ghuess, she did tell me the kids knew to some extent what happened: they came into her room the next time they saw her and said that ""dad was really mean to her and she left"" and then they said, ""and then he told us they broke up."" So my heart is at peace in some ways in that I don't have to worry they think I just abandoned them or left. I love them with all my heart, and I still love their dad. But knowing they know a little bit of what happened helps. The little one especially has attachment trauma around the divorce, and they talk about but haven't gotten him into therapy, so I really worried how this would exacerbate it and affect him. Even the weekend his dad discarded me, the boy squeezed my arm and said, ""You're so much *fun,""* and I had the sense I brought more joy to that house than they'd experienced in a while. He would also hug me for no reason and ask when I had to go and when I'd be back next, so yeah, again, some lingering trauma that I worry this has worsened. In some ways, I wanted to take my ex up on it when he said I could let myself into his house and see the kids to collect my things, but belong knowing I couldn't see them without crying a lot, I also didn't want to do his dirty work in explaining things for them or pacifying his behavior, and I didn't want him to be able to wipe his conscience clean so easily, as in, ""See? She got to say goodbye.""

It’s approaching four months now, and I haven’t heard anything from him. People say they always come back, and maybe the liking of my posts a few weeks in was what that was and there won't be any more. Obviously I think I deserve more--a conversation, face-to-face, or at least a phone call apology for the way he executed this--but I've mostly given up on getting it. He doesn’t watch my stories even though I have a public Instagram account, and because he does have a private account and I removed myself, I can’t see any of his posts, though I know by the post count that he’s only made two since I unfollowed him months ago (he’d made a few between the breakup and my unfollowing, which made me think he was mostly posting for me to see, especially since the photos were of his kids’ last day of school and other things I’d want to know about because I love them). I still imagine his car pulling in my driveway after work, and I still think of him on the nights I know he doesn't have the kids and we'd normally be alone together. But it's all fruitless wishing, and I know I should wish for better treatment for myself. I just wish I knew what was going on inside his head or how he felt about me or what he’d done. He has a really sweet heart and had been pretty consistent and communicative and thoughtful during our nearly two years together, so I never saw this coming except while I was grieving my infertility, but I think what I’d said probably triggered an abandonment wound, and I feel like he never really healed from the affair or divorce. He goes to therapy, but only once every three months (he gets 4 appointments for free from his employer and spreads them out), so I can’t imagine they build any momentum or he’s really been able to process the divorce or heal his attachment style (which I think he’s aware of, but I don’t think he necessarily realizes that what he did is an ‘avoidant discard’). Meanwhile even with all you’ve taught me about avoidants and an avoidant discard, I still feel absolutely abandoned and baffled by the continued silence and distance. I want more than anything for him to apologize and take accountability, even if he doesn’t want to get back together with me, because it’s the right thing to do, but I am also having a really hard time accepting that he wanted this or that it wasn’t anything other than an impulsive thing he did when he was totally overwhelmed from life stressors, but again, even if it was, he isn’t trying to repair it. I also know he carries shame around not being financially well-off—he had a good job as an arborist, and he loves what he does, but I know he felt bad that he couldn’t afford a downpayment with me.

Anyway, that’s my story. I can’t tell you all how much I’d appreciate any insight any of you have around any of this. It seems to deviate in a lot of ways from a traditional avoidant discard--namely, we were together and pretty happy and consistently communicative for nearly two years--but in other ways, like the total shutdown, the abrupt dumping via phone (no conversation around it, no chance to repair, and then not seeing me or even talking to me on the phone since), and the way that he could talk about *some* emotionally intimate experiences (his wife cheating, the abusive partnership I was in prior to meeting him) but not *all* (anything having to do with us, or any perceived criticism of his behavior in the relationship), seem to point to him being an avoidant (a dismissive, I think?).

As we enter month four of no contact, and as I go back to school at my university a half mile away from his house, I am definitely doing better and coming into accept that I may never hear from him, and that this is just the end, but it’s still very hard to take. I don’t think he’s rebounded or that he’s the type to just throw himself into someone else, and his ex-wife is still with her girlfriend, so I don’t think they’re getting back together. I just don’t understand, and I can’t help but feel like he self-sabotaged and now is telling himself either a) I’m better off without him, which honestly at this point is probably (definitely?) true, or b) that he did too much damage to even attempt repair. Or maybe, though I don't want to believe it, c) that he did the only thing he could do because he was just so utterly unhappy in our relationship.

I’m focused on my healing and I *am* healing, but it remains so hard to try to understand what the fuck happened to me, and why. So I'm reaching out with the hope someone smarter than I or more well-versed in this can offer some insight, assuming anyone even takes the time to read this or feels invested in any way.

Last year I did 75 hard and before that I did a lot of cardio every week and brought my weight down significantly. Loved my weight training every evening 5-6 days a week and built muscles with definition.
Beginning this year I took a break for months as life threw it's inevitable curveball my way and I had health issues that made me stop and lost my gains, but I've resumed for the past months.
2x workouts a day with 50 minutes cardio in the morning before abs and general body, 30 minutes in the evening before my weightlifting sessions.

Now I've been learning a new skill which keeps me busy and needs much practice for me to improve as a novice so I usually work at nights so I get 4-5 hour sleep at most except on weekends when I find sleep becomes like a drug and I doze off at multiple occasions. I usually need coffee to go through my day and I feel stressed and groggy sometimes.

Since the past days I've noticed more that even with coffee I fall asleep and I'm trying to understand what that means for my body so I can adjust and avoid burnout. Am I overtraining or what could this mean? ",0,1755722760.0,bodyweightfitness,1,0.5,False

My professor accused me of using AI primarily over the highlighted sentence. (She said the whole thing is AI). 
The second survey was about music and what you imagine when you hear music and songs. 

I will admit I have adapted many words such as nuance from ChatGPT because it makes my writing sound more philosophical and academically appealing. I also search for synonyms of words when I try to prevent repetitiveness in my writings. 

Since this assignment is very small, I did try to bullshit my way through. (Even though all other surveys are basically people trying to bullshit their way through). I tried to remain within the boundaries of the surveys lacking variants or consistency as their bad and goods respectively. And after the first paragraph I figured the second paragraph looked very similar to my comments about the first survey, therefore I did a lot of switcharoos using terms and synonyms I don’t normally use, but found appealing to add to the text. 

I did not use AI at all, at least not have it generate the text for me. I had searched up synonyms for different terms I wanted to express and that’s it. Tried to explain it to the professor but she’s like “I know what I’m doing, this is AI”.

I also put in some earlier work I did prior about five times the length of this assignment, which came out 77 percent AI, and that was a memoir I did as part of a journal.

Since our economic situation was bad, the government had given me some money under a scholarship, and since my mom knew about that, she had some expectations. In middle school, I got her a book because she was into the TV show of it back then. She looked at it unpleased. It wasn't that cheap for me tho I got it from a fancy store in my country. I even got her a fairy-shaped bookmark and put it inside it, but I guess she didn't even realise it. Later on, she gaslighted me into buying her a lamp. After that, I kinda lost my spark in searching for what she might like and just got her random gifts since she will never be happy with them. I don't even remember what I got her throughout the years. Right now, I'm in a free community college, and I again got a scholarship because of my poor situation, and now it pays better. So this year I was like ""okay, this year it will be a gift that something she would be pleased with because it is expensive"" and I found a coffy machine that she saw at my grandma's and wanted back then. There were cheaper versions, but I went ahead and found a bigger and better one that has multiple settings for different coffee types. It was going to be the best gift, I assure you, but last week she started to buzz around me saying, ""For my bd present, you can buy me headphones"". (The headphones she wanted were way cheaper) So I told my dad to get them, but as days went by, she kept saying, ""Are you going to buy them?"" ""I want those headphones."" ""Don't forget my headphones."" etc. When she involved my sister, I got tired of her saying headphones, so I deleted the coffee machine from my shopping cart and added the headphones that she would like (I guessed that she would want Xiaomi. She thinks it's the best brand or sm, I don't know at this point). Just now she came to my room and after a while pulled out her phone and said ""hey, I have chosen the headphones, look buy me these"" showing me the same Xiaomi headphones. I said, ""Presents don't work that way, and I had my plans, but since you don't like anything, okay fine, I will get you those stupid headphones, okay?"". After that, she said, ""Well, I'm telling you so you don't buy me unnecessary mugs and dishes again, what's the big deal?"" So that's where I lost it and yelled at her about the expensive coffee machine that she can't have now. She just left my room quietly. I asked my sister and she thinks it's normal for me to be mad, but I need someone else's opinion. Please tell me what I should have done in this situation.",6,1755722694.0,AmItheAsshole,25,0.72,False

I don’t know if you know the type, but he makes noting jokes all the time and can’t seem to have a normal conversation. Anyway he asked me on a date over some wine. I told him I don’t drink alcohol and he then wrote ”okey then, let’s meet innocently over a cup of coffee”. I asked him what he meant with innocently and he said that ”with innocently I mean you don’t have to feel any pressure, if you feel any”. 

It feels like he means pressure when it comes to sexual expectations. Isn’t it creepy to say something like that?

I’m 19 and from Kuwait. I’m the type of person who finds comfort in the little things. I love black coffee, rainy nights, and the kind of weather that makes you wanna just stay in with music. Cats mean the world to me (I actually have one named Billie ).

Music is my escape—I’m always listening to Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, Mitski, Melanie Martinez, The Weeknd, and so many others. Their songs feel like they tell my story in ways I can’t always put into words.

I’m obsessed with mushrooms (in food, of course), and steak with mushrooms is honestly my favourite thing ever. I also love traveling, exploring new places, trying new food, and just wandering around like I belong everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

I prefer deep talks over small talk any day. I’d rather know your dreams, fears, and secrets than just your favourite colour. I can be soft, but I’m also stronger than people think. Sometimes mysterious, sometimes playful, always real.

Skincare and self-care are a big part of me—I love showers, taking care of my skin, and just anything that makes me feel calm and grounded. I’m also really into filming and creating content, I love the idea of building something out of my own vision.

At heart, I’m a dreamer. I’ve been through a lot, but I still believe in the future I see for myself.

And one more thing, I’m planning to escape my family soon—probably on October 1st, I’ll be leaving for London. I’m an ex-Muslim, and I can’t bear living here any longer, pretending to be someone I’m not.",0,1755722447.0,Needafriend,3,0.5,False
1mvqo78,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeFriendships/comments/1mvqo78/friendships_and_income_differences/,Friendships and Income Differences,"To preface this, I lived pretty low-income for many years - pretty much lived negative paycheck to negative paycheck. I also come from a lower-to-mid blue collar family. I have also worked in a social work situation, with low-income, truly struggling families.

I am a middle aged woman (queer, but in a hetero-presenting relationship), childfree, and self aware about my current income privilege. I currently live in a rural area that’s fairly friendly to counterculture and differences. It’s a mix. We are comfortable due to my spouse’s lucrative career (I won’t say what they do). I have also been in - very much - the opposite position in life. There was a time I couldn’t pay rent, bills, and had to rely on EBT and food pantries for groceries. I get it. I do not flaunt or brag about my comforts, but I also don’t hide it. It’s part of my life. It’s integrated into my stories, if that makes sense. Again, I am aware of my privilege, but I am not going to be apologetic or timid about my life to friends. Just to be clear, we aren’t jet-setters or anything like that. We are able to own a home and do things.

I have a friend who also owns her own home in the area (definitely a privilege), works in a spa service industry, and teaches a body movement class. To be trained in these modalities, she’s had to dish out thousands of dollars for training and she only works part-time. She is a bit over-protective of her teen and says she can’t work more because she needs to be there for them. However, “not being able to afford things” comes up a lot. Her partner is older and works at odd jobs here and there. They struggle somewhat, and she’s made it clear they have no buffer or savings, but they are not destitute, by any means. I am just giving context, here.

I am struggling because I don’t have many friends in this area since we moved here a few years ago. I am older, have no children (glad to be childfree, but makes it hard to connect because many others are parents, as are many of my out-of-town friends), and am fairly happy kicking it at home. I do like to connect with people here and there, though - go get coffee, take a walk, have people over for chill hangouts, etc. Something I have noticed with this friend is that because of her fixation with her teen, we only hang out once in a blue moon for maybe an hour. We have good conversations, but I feel I just don’t know her or fully connect. Also, the income discrepancy comes up on her end a LOT. I will be telling her something mostly unrelated, but that could involve affordability, and that’s where she immediately goes - “Well, be lucky you have savings. We don’t,” or “You’re so lucky you can eat out. We don’t have the money to do that.” I am struggling with this because I know what true struggling is, but I am just telling her a story from my life (that she has asked about, btw). It’s so weird and negative, just because the fact that she owns her own home and she can pay for movement training, in this economy, does not make her “poor” (her word).

I guess my question is, have any of you ever dealt with this or something similar and how do you deal with it?

Another, and potentially harder one for the childfree adults, here… How do YOU make other adult friends? Yes, I have tried volunteering, but I am currently in graduate school and have little time, right now.",2,1755722431.0,ChildfreeFriendships,0,0.75,False

I’ll be in Osaka from August 20th to September 14th. I’m traveling solo and would love to meet new people — whether it’s for exploring the city, hanging out, having a chat, or even just grabbing a coffee. If you’re around and feel like connecting, feel free to reach out!",1,1755722381.0,OsakaTravel,0,1.0,False
1mvqndd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvqndd,"When you can't decide which iconic divers watch to get, why not get them both?","I have been obsessed with watches since i was a young boy. Im dating myself here but I remember buying the first casio calculator watch when it first came out.  I fondly recall my Swatch watch collecting days from the 80's!  I remember I would pretend I was James Bond and talk into my calculator watch as I ran through the neighborhood.  My dad had an old Timex with a leather band.  I can still remember exactly how that leather smelled. I would watch my dad getting ready for work and every morning he'd wind that old Timex as part of his morning routine. I could hardly wait to be a grown up so I could make coffee and make watch winding a part of my morning routine as well. You dont have to pretend anymore.  We have Apple watches now that are just like my imaginary spy watch but even better.  I can find something I truly appreciate in just about any watch regardless of its cost or origin.

Yesterday I shared how my sub no date had just arrived. Well today is another good day because my 2025 brand new Seamaster is here.  I know some folks on here dont have any love for Omegas and thats okay. To each his/her own.  These watches are incredibly well made.  The moment you pick it up you know you are holding a formidable timepiece.  There is a feel that only well-made genuine Swiss timepieces have.  Technology has gotten so advanced that the replicas look almost identical in many cases. You can counterfeit looks but you can't counterfeit feel. There is nothing quite like holding and wearing a well-made Swiss watch.  Its a feeling and a love that never dulls, never dwindles and never dies.  

If you are a Submariner fan next time you're in a boutique or a shop and you see a Seamaster in the case take the time to hold it and view it all the angles. You will immediately recognize the feel that only care, history, quality and excellence can produce. Quite simply its a fine fine watch and for me a nod to the days of old when I was once a young James Bond wearing a casio calculator watch.

1mvqmuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mvqmuz/could_the_best_wireless_earbuds_be_from/,Could the best wireless earbuds be from SoundPEATS Q30 HD+?,"Testing out the SoundPEATS Q30 HD+ wireless earbuds felt like stepping into a tech enthusiast's paradise. These sleek and lightweight earbuds, at just 2.5 grams each, immediately impressed me with their comfort and ergonomic design. One moment I was pairing them with my phone via Bluetooth 5.2, and seconds later, I was immersed in clear, vibrant audio. The minimalistic black finish combined with the magnetic design makes them a breeze to store; they clasp together like a neat accessory around your neck when not in use. It's perfect for someone like me who constantly forgets where they leave their gadgets!  

**Performance and Sound Quality**

The 10mm audio drivers paired with the aptX-HD codec set these apart for sound quality. The level of bass isn’t just immersive—it’s like having a mini concert in your ears. I tried a mix of tracks from podcasts to heavy bass EDM, and these earbuds handled it all remarkably well. The stereo effect is balanced, and the sound isolation with the right-fit ear tips effectively blocks out background disturbances. Whether I was on a brisk morning run or sitting in a bustling coffee shop, I could always count on clear, uninterrupted listening.  

[Check SoundPEATS Q30 HD+ price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b07q85xj6m/)  

**Ease of Use**

When it comes to user-friendliness, the built-in control buttons are a lifesaver. Pausing tracks, skipping songs, or answering calls was intuitive and responsive — I didn’t experience any awkward delays. Moreover, the added microphone meant calls were just as clear on the other end, confirmed by my coworker during an impromptu chat in the middle of a workout.  

**Battery Longevity and Charging**

The playtime these earbuds offer completely caught me off guard. A solid 12 hours of music or talk time on a single charge? Yes, you read that right. I used them for nearly an entire day, toggling between playlists, hands-free calls, and an audiobook, and they just kept going. Recharge time was also minimal – 1.5 hours to full capacity, thanks to the USB-C cable. It’s refreshing not to have to wait ages for your gear to be ready again.  

**Durability and Fit**

Workout enthusiasts, you’re going to love these. The IPX5 water-resistance rating means they can endure sweat and light rain during outdoor runs. While testing, I accidentally splashed water on them when hydrating post-gym session—it wasn’t a cause for panic, they worked perfectly afterward. Plus, having five different ear tip sizes (including XL and XS) ensured I found my perfect snug fit without the dreaded “falling-out” issue that plagues some other earbuds.  

**Benefits**

- Long-lasting battery that supports non-stop use for hours.
- Convenient magnetic design for secure storage.
- Excellent audio quality backed by aptX-HD codec.
- Wide compatibility with Bluetooth devices (version 4.0 and above).
- IPX5 water resistance for added durability during workouts.

**Weaknesses**

- While the earbuds are comfortable, the plastic material does make them feel slightly less premium.
- The lack of active noise cancellation (ANC) feels noticeable in very noisy environments.
- Only one Bluetooth connection at a time; multipoint support could enhance versatility.

**Competing Products**

While testing these earbuds, I dug into how they compare to peers, like the Anker Soundcore Spirit X and the JBL Endurance Sprint. The Anker model pairs extra-long battery life with similarly good sound performance but comes at a notably higher price. Meanwhile, JBL’s option has ANC, a tempting addition for travelers or commuters, but its fit wasn’t nearly as customizable or secure as these SoundPEATS. Truth be told, for the price, the balance of features offered makes them shine against these rivals in many areas.  

**Smart Spending**

Given the combination of features like advanced Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, aptX-HD codec for immersive sound, and lasting comfort with multiple ear tip options, these earbuds feel like excellent value for their cost. Yes, they have some areas for improvement, but their performance still makes them a commendable choice. Missing things like ANC doesn't diminish their overall usability as a workout and all-purpose music companion.

Detailed Review,"The OVENTE CM412LBL Drip Coffee Maker came into my life thanks to my constant quest for the perfect cup of coffee. With its light blue, retro-modern design and promise of convenience, it instantly captured my attention. As a coffee enthusiast who values both style and substance, I found myself brewing cup after cup with this machine, dissecting its features, strengths, and, of course, areas where it could improve.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that stands out about this coffee maker is its aesthetic appeal. It effortlessly blends style with functionality. The light blue finish gives it a soft charm, making it a delightful addition to any kitchen. The compact dimensions (measuring 7 x 10.8 x 12.4 inches) are great for saving counter space, yet it still manages to fit a borosilicate glass carafe capable of holding up to 12 cups of coffee. I couldn’t help but notice how sturdy and heat-resistant the glass carafe felt, and it kept my coffee hot for longer than expected. Plus, the anti-drip spout ensures no mess while pouring, which is a godsend if you’re clumsy like me before caffeine kicks in.

**Ease of Use**

One of my favorite things about this coffee maker is the one-touch operation. Brewing coffee became as easy as pushing a button, and I appreciated not having to fiddle with complicated settings early in the morning. The reusable filter is also a thoughtful touch, providing both sustainability and convenience. Although you can still use paper filters if that's your thing, I opted for the reusable one to save on waste (and cash).

[Check OVENTE CM412LBL price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cqn6fwtl/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**

This machine brews coffee with satisfying consistency. The flavor extraction is solid, and the anti-drip technology ensures a smooth brewing process without spills or leaks. The easy-view water gauge is pure genius when it comes to measuring the right amount of water; no more guesswork! I tested different coffee grounds, adjusting the brewing strength with the amount of coffee I used. No matter the blend, the coffee maker delivered pleasing results, though hardcore coffee connoisseurs might find the depth of flavor to be just shy of perfection. The appliance is designed for regular drip coffee enthusiasts rather than specialty drink aficionados.

**Advantages**

- Stylish and compact design complements any kitchen aesthetic.  
- One-touch operation simplifies the brewing process for busy mornings.  
- Borosilicate glass carafe offers durability and retains coffee temperature.  
- Anti-drip spout prevents spills while pouring.  
- Reusable filter reduces waste and enhances flavor extraction.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Takes a little longer to brew a full carafe compared to higher-end models.  
- Not ideal for creating specialty coffee drinks like lattes or cappuccinos.  
- Slightly limited in its manual operation mode, offering no programmable features.  

**Safety Features That Impress**

Small but impactful details like the non-slip feet and anti-drip system are what elevate the experience with this coffee maker. These features ensure there's no slipping or leaking, even when counter space gets busy in the morning. As someone who’s had accidents with cheaper coffee makers, this was a highlight for me. Adding to the list of positives, the carafe's wide-grip handle makes pouring super comfortable, even when it’s full.

**Competitors**

In its price range, this product competes with some other great options. Products like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker and Hamilton Beach BrewStation are popular choices. However, I found the reusable filter on the OVENTE model to be a major advantage—it’s both eco-friendly and economical, unlike others that depend solely on disposable filters. On the downside, those competitors do sometimes offer programmable features, setting them apart for users who like to preset their brewing schedule. The build quality and aesthetic elegance of the OVENTE, though, make it a clear winner for those who appreciate style alongside substance.

**Cost Efficiency**

When it comes to value for money, I’d say this coffee maker holds its own. While there are cheaper options, few offer the combination of aesthetic appeal, capacity, and thoughtful features that this machine does. The reusable filter alone is a major cost-saving feature over time. Considering its durable build and reliable performance, I feel it’s a solid purchase for anyone looking to step up their coffee game without breaking the bank.

Feel free to roast me if you don't like this question, I admit I am a newbie at this.  But I'd like to get into making espresso.   I have some points on a rewards website at work.  I have enough to get a Philips 1200.  Or a grinder and semi-automatic.  

I like black coffee, didn't get into espresso until I had cuban coffee on my trip to Key West this summer.  My palette isn't that advanced, but I can tell good from not good.  My wife likes the super sweet concoctions from the green mermaid store.  I'll be trying to replicate some of those for her.  

Grinder choices on the rewards site are the breville smart grinder pro and the fellow opus.  There are other choices, but I narrowed it down to these.  
There are lots of espresso machine options.  The best ones I've narrowed down to are the breville Bambino, delonghi dedica and linea classic, Cuisinart espresso bar, capresso ec select and some others that look pretty basic.  

Given these choices and I would be spending $0 out of pocket for this setup, I'm looking for suggestions.  I figure I'll get someone from each camp to say why their suggestion is the best and we will not reach any concensus.  But let's give it a whirl, shall we?  If nothing else, a good though expiriment for the group to noodle on.  

I'm leaning towards the Philips 1200.  I'm willing to trade ease of use for quality.  I've read the 1200 makes a decent cup when you get it dialed in, but will never be a great cup.  My wife would likely use the 1200, but if she has to futz with the dosing and grinding and all that, she's out.  

There are better choices on the website, these fall in my points range.  I'm sure once I get whatever we decide on, after a years time I'll start wanting to trade up my gear. Especially if you jokers keep showing pictures of you amazing setups.  I've got some kitchen envy, for sure. ",4,1755722276.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’ve always been the grounded one in the group—the one who laughs last but thinks first.
My name is Ellis Maddox. 27. Architect.
Order comforts me. Blueprints, clean lines, symmetry—they give shape to a world that rarely makes sense.

I don’t drink much. I don’t like noise. I don’t like surprises.
And yet, somehow, I agreed to a cabin trip with the others.

We were celebrating a break—someone’s engagement, I think. Or maybe just the end of summer.
But I can’t remember now.

Not clearly.

Part II: The Others

1. Kayla – My oldest friend. A medic. She’s sharp, but she’s been off lately. Zoning out mid-sentence, forgetting things she just said. She laughs it off, but I’ve seen her hands shake when she thinks no one’s looking.

2. Marcus – The funny one. Always with a story, always with a smirk. He’s the glue, in a way. But he hides behind humor—like he’s afraid of silence. Afraid of thinking too long.

3. Dani – My ex. We broke up over a year ago, but somehow we’re still friends. Kind of. She reads people too well. Knows what you’re feeling before you do. That used to comfort me. Now it unnerves me. Sometimes I catch her looking at me like she’s expecting something—something I’m supposed to remember.

Part III: The Beginning of the End

The cabin is buried deep in the woods, five hours from the city, no signal, no distractions. That’s the point, I guess.
“Disconnect to reconnect,” Kayla said.
But I don’t remember agreeing. I don’t remember packing.
I just remember… being here.

It started the first night.
The power flickered. The air felt heavy, like it was pressing against my skin. The others laughed it off, but I kept hearing… something. Not footsteps, exactly. More like… repetition. Like something rehearsing the idea of being alive.

Part IV: The Fracture

The days feel disjointed now. I’ll wake up, and the coffee’s already brewed, even though no one claims to have made it.
I found a note in my handwriting that I don’t remember writing:
“Don’t trust the mirrors.”

At first, I thought I was sleepwalking. But then Marcus said he saw me outside last night—just standing there under the trees, staring up at the cabin.
I never left the bed.

Dani doesn’t act surprised. She just watches me, like she’s waiting for something to click.
Like I’ve done this before.

Part V: Mind Twists Begin

Things are starting to repeat.
Kayla told the same story at dinner three nights in a row—but swears it’s the first time.
Marcus asked me the same question twice within an hour:
“Do you remember what really happened to us?”

I told him to stop screwing with me. He just smiled.
“Maybe you’re the one screwing with us.”

Part VI: Theories That Don’t Make Sense (But Might)
	1.	I’m in a loop.
Not a time loop, exactly. More like a mental one. Like I’m trapped inside the memory of a trip I took once—but pieces are missing, corrupted.
	2.	One of them isn’t real.
Someone feels… off. Dani says I’m projecting. But then I caught Kayla’s reflection not moving in sync with her.
	3.	None of this is real.
The cabin. The friends. My self.
What if I’m still in the city, in a hospital bed, in a coma?
What if this is my mind’s way of buffering pain, hiding trauma?
	4.	I did something.
Something I can’t live with. And this is the punishment—reliving a twisted version of it until I remember.

Part VII: Cracks in Myself

Last night, I found a blueprint on the table.
It was a layout of the cabin—but not the one we’re staying in.
It was different. It had a basement.
We don’t have a basement.
Except now… we do.

I opened the door behind the pantry today and found stairs that weren’t there before.
Cold, damp steps.
Leading down.

I’m afraid to go down there.
I think I already have.
I think I keep doing it.

And each time, I forget. Each time, I come back a little… less.

Part VIII: Descent

The others were still asleep when I opened the hidden door again.
No creak. No chill. Just a gaping dark mouth at the base of the pantry, like it had always been there—waiting for me to remember it.

I counted the steps out loud as I went down. Thirty-seven.
But halfway, they stopped echoing.

The staircase just… ended.
Not into a room. Not into dirt.
Just into more hallway—cold cement walls, flickering lights overhead.

I should have turned back.
But something in me said I’d already been here before.

And something else whispered:

“You need to finish it this time.”

Part IX: Memories That Aren’t Mine

The hallway was lined with doors.
All identical.
No numbers. No knobs. Just a single word carved into each in small, perfect script.

GUILT
CHOICE
TRUTH
ELLIS

I stopped at that last one.
It wasn’t carved.
It was burned in.

I pressed my hand against the surface. Cold.
Then suddenly—warm.

Like the door had a pulse.

Behind me, I heard my own voice whisper:

“You made us real. Now face what you did.”

Part X: Theories Twist Tighter

I used to think I was the victim of whatever this place is.
But what if I’m the architect of it?
What if I didn’t just design buildings—what if I designed this whole twisted pocket reality to protect myself from something I couldn’t handle?

A mental structure.
A safe house for a fractured mind.

The blueprints. The repetition. The unnatural symmetry of this place.

What if I built this whole prison…
to forget?

Part XI: Friend or Construct?

When I came back upstairs, the others were sitting at the table.
Silent. Not eating. Just staring at me.

Kayla finally spoke.

“You opened it, didn’t you?”

I nodded.

Marcus shook his head slowly. “You always do.”

I asked them—begged them—to tell me the truth.
Dani stood up, came close, placed a hand on my chest.

“It’s not that we’re fake, Ellis. It’s that you made us too real. That’s why you can’t let go.”

Then she whispered:

“Do you remember the fire?”

Part XII: The Flash

A house.
Not the cabin.
My first solo project.

I see myself there, screaming for someone inside. The flames are too high.
Three people trapped.
My friends.
My team.

They were real once.

But I couldn’t save them.

I blamed the contractor. The design. God.
But deep down… I knew it was my miscalculation. My structure. My ego.

So I came here.
Into the version of that house I could control.

And I rebuilt them.

Kayla. Marcus. Dani.

They’re not ghosts.
They’re guilt echoes.
Perfectly simulated fragments of who they were.

But they remember.

And they want me to stop living in the replica.

Part XIII: The Final Door

Tonight, they tell me I have to make a choice.

Stay in the loop.
Stay in the cabin.
Keep pretending.

Or walk through the last door—the one labeled TRUTH.

But they warn me:
If I do, the world I’ve built burns—for good.

And they’ll be gone with it.

No more laughter. No more dinners.
No more pretending we’re all okay.

Just me.
Alone.
In a world where they died because of me.

Part XIV: TRUTH

I stood before the door, my hand trembling just above the surface.

The others were silent. Watching.

Kayla had tears in her eyes—maybe from the smoke of the fire I hadn’t remembered until now. Or maybe from something deeper. A goodbye we both knew was coming.

Marcus gave a sad smile. “You always had to know. That was the problem with you, Ellis.”

Dani didn’t speak. She just nodded.
And I felt everything she didn’t say land like a weight in my chest.

I took a breath.

Then I opened the door.

Part XV: The Collapse

It wasn’t a door.

It was a mirror.

And it shattered the moment I touched it.

I fell.

Not physically. Psychologically.
Through floors of memory I’d buried beneath blueprint lines and fake smiles.

I saw it all.

⸻

The Fire.

A design flaw. A support beam too close to the fuel line.

It was my mistake.

Kayla, Marcus, Dani—all part of my team. We were celebrating the project’s opening night. I was proud. Drunk on ambition.

When the explosion hit, I was outside.

They weren’t.

⸻

The Trial.

I was never charged. “Freak accident,” they said.
But I knew better.
And I couldn’t live with it.

So I didn’t.

⸻

The Build.

I retreated inward.
Built the cabin in my mind—the perfect reconstruction.
And inside it, I recreated them.
Gave them personalities, laughter, flaws.
Gave myself a world where they forgave me.

But they weren’t just echoes.
They evolved.

They remembered.

And they’ve been waiting all this time for me to finally let go.

⸻

Part XVI: Waking Up

I opened my eyes to white light.

Hospital ceiling.
IV in my arm.
My mouth dry. My mind sharp. Real.

A voice: “Ellis? Can you hear me?”

I turned. A nurse. Real. Solid. No flicker.

“Welcome back,” she said. “You’ve been under for a long time.”

“How long?” I croaked.

She glanced at her chart. “Eighteen months.”

⸻

Part XVII: The World That Waited

I’m walking again. Slowly. One foot in front of the other.

My license is suspended. My firm dissolved.
But I’m alive.

And they’re not.

Every day I wake up, the guilt sits beside me.
But I sit beside it now.

I talk to Dani when I drink my coffee.
I hear Marcus when a joke pops into my head.
I feel Kayla’s presence in my silence.

They’re gone.

But they’re also part of me—the parts that refuse to let pain make me hollow.

Final Chapter: Embers

Six months out of the coma.

I don’t dream about the cabin anymore.
Not because it’s gone, but because I finally left it.

Some days, though, I catch a flicker in the mirror—just for a second. Dani brushing her hair behind her ear. Marcus smirking like he just made a joke. Kayla’s eyes full of concern, like I’m forgetting something again.

They’re not ghosts. They’re not hallucinations.
They’re reminders.
Anchors.

⸻

I went to the memorial last week.

The company never rebuilt the site. It’s fenced off. Charred beams still mark the shape of what once stood there.

A plaque reads:

“In memory of those we lost on the night the sky burned.”

I left flowers.
And beneath the bouquet, a note.

“I remember now.
I see you clearly.
I built a perfect world to escape you.
But it was your pain that brought me back.”

⸻

Facing the Families

It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

Kayla’s mother wouldn’t look at me.
Marcus’s brother punched me in the chest, once—then cried into my shoulder.
Dani’s father asked only one question:

“Was she happy, in the end?”

I couldn’t answer at first. My throat closed.
Then I said: “She was trying to forgive me. That’s more than I deserved.”

He nodded. “Then she died the way she lived.”

⸻

Reconstruction

I don’t design buildings anymore.

Not yet.

Instead, I volunteer. I speak to architecture students about safety, ethics, accountability. The importance of owning your mistakes before they become permanent. Before they start breathing.

And sometimes, when no one’s around, I sketch the cabin again.
Not as it was in my mind. Not symmetrical or pristine.
This time, it’s flawed.
Real.
Lived-in.

And it doesn’t have a basement.

⸻

Closure

Grief is a haunting.
It lingers in doorways. In coffee mugs. In songs you didn’t know meant anything—until they play again, when you’re alone.

But truth?

Truth is what happens when the haunting stops being a curse…
and starts becoming a conversation.

⸻

Final Lines

I live in a small apartment now. No mirrors in the bedroom.
But every morning, I wake up, drink my coffee, and whisper to the quiet:

“I remember you.
I’m still here because of you.
And I won’t build another lie to hide behind.”

And somewhere, I like to believe they hear me.
And in their own way…
They smile.

1mvqkbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mvqkbg/my_granddad_doesnt_talk_much/,My Granddad Doesn't Talk Much,"I have very fond memories of my grandparents. They were the only grandparents I knew of since I never knew my mother, much less her family, but my dad was very caring, which I believe came from his mom, Sarah. Sarah, or Grandmom, was a very caring woman who would always fill my skinny little child body with copious amounts of snack cakes and chips, claiming in her thick, country accent, “That kid is just skin and bones! He needs some fat on em if he is ever gonna get a wife!” I was seven at the time. 

Rufus, or Granddad, was very different than Grandmom. He was quiet and kept to himself, and never really talked to me that much. He would just grunt at me, and whether I liked it or not, would drag me outside to cut logs, build fences, and do any other physical labor that would magically pop up. I only remember him telling me two things besides “Come here, boy,” and instructions on how to use tools on whatever project we had at hand. The first was when he made me help him build a stable. I asked him, “Are you getting horses, Granddad?” He stopped screwing in the new hinge on the barn door, looked at me, then looked at the stable as if he was lost in thought. “Maybe,” he said and went right back to work. 

The second time was when I reached my sixteenth birthday. My dad and I decided to visit my grandparents to celebrate. Grandmom immediately started offering me chips, sodas, coffee, and everything else that was in the pantry. After fighting her off with everything but a stick, I finally relented and got a cookie and a juice box to placate her demands. My grandfather was nowhere to be seen. After the normal pleasantries, I went outside to look at the stables I helped build. He never did get any horses. On the side of the building, I saw a massive pile of unsplit logs, and on a whim, I grabbed the old axe my hands were so familiar with and began whacking away. I lost track of time, and as the sun started to go down, I realized I split the last log. With impeccable timing, I felt Granddad’s large, calloused hand grab my shoulder. He was covered in sweat and looked as if he had just run a marathon. “You’ll do just fine,” he said. He picked up the pieces I just cut and threw them on the woodpile. He then gestured to the house. The smell of a pot roast reminded my stomach of just how hungry it was, and screamed at me to find the source. “Come on, boy,” Granddad said, and smiled at me. Sure, my granddad never really said much, but he would always smile that warm, compassionate smile. I haven’t seen that smile in a long while. Not since Grandmom died last year. 

I arrived at his cabin in the early morning. The forest that his cabin resided in painted the area with oranges, reds, and yellows in the trees as well as on the ground. A cold breeze helped me to decide to wear my jacket as I stepped out of the car. Leaves crunched underneath my feet as I walked over to the cabin. The grass hasn’t been cut in a while, and it lay on the ground in a dead sleep. I looked toward the stable I helped build so long ago. There were still no horses.

I knocked on the door, and after a few seconds, I heard a deep grunt, which I took as his “granddad language” to come in. The interior seemed normal. It wasn’t clean, but it wasn’t overly dirty either, as if he did just enough not to be considered a slob. The lights were off except for the beams of sunlight streaming in through the windows. Granddad was kneeling beside the fireplace, looking in his cabinet where he stored the wood. Grandmom didn’t like the logs to be visible, so he built a wood cabinet by hand just for her. He would have done anything for her.

“Hey,” I greeted him with a low, sympathetic voice, “How are you doing? Just thought I would come by and check on you.” He stood up with a strained grunt and, without looking at me, said, “Come on, boy. We’re out of firewood.” With that, he grabbed his jacket, which was flung over a rocking chair, and headed for the door. 

Pushing the wheelbarrow, I followed him into the forest. He’s always been tall, and despite his age, his legs were still long and strong, making it a struggle to follow him when the wheelbarrow would try to flip with every root its loose wheel would slam into. We delved into the woods for about half a mile when we stopped in a clearing where trees lay on the forest floor. Giants felled by Rufus’s mighty axe honed his body into a physique that was as sturdy as the trunks he cleaved. I remember helping cut trees down to build the stable and asking him why he insisted on using an axe when a chainsaw would be much easier. 

“You have no problems using a screw gun,” I said, “It’s not like you’re Amish. Why use an axe?” All I got was a grunt in return.

The sound of an axe hitting wood with a crack shook me out of my memory as he started his work. I quickly picked up my axe and jogged up to the other end of the tree and started swinging. I wasn’t as powerful or as fast as my granddad, but years of unpaid manual labor for him helped build my strength and stamina. 

Right when the cold started to stab my lungs like needles, I noticed Granddad stopped cutting. I looked over at him as he was looking up in the trees as if he were searching for something. He then bowed his head and rubbed his eyes, letting out a loud sigh. 

“Come on, boy,” he started walking toward the cabin. 

“What? We haven’t even started loadin’ up the wheelbarrow?” He grunted and waved me along. I went to get the wheelbarrow, but he stopped me. “Just the axe,” he spoke in an asperated tone, not even looking at me. I nodded and followed him back to the cabin. When we arrived at the clearing, I noticed everything was gone. No cabin, no car, no stable, nothing. 

“Did we go the wrong way?” I know we didn’t. “Maybe it’s a little further up?” I knew it wasn’t, but I didn’t want to believe it. It just seemed impossible. My grandfather said nothing. Instead, he immediately went to where the stable used to be and bent down to pick something up. It was a hatch. He eased himself on his knees as he reached into the man-made hole and pulled out a backpack. He gestured me over with his hand and handed me a canvas bag, which felt like it had something round and hard in it. “Don’t look in it.”  He slipped the backpack onto his shoulders. 

“What do you mean by ‘don’t look’? What’s in here?” 

He said nothing and started walking toward the way we came without acknowledging my questions. Knowing he probably wouldn’t give me any answers no matter how much I asked, I kept my mouth shut as I followed him. 

According to my wrist watch, we were time travelers. The hands on my watch seemed to be going backwards and forwards at random times, losing their interval structure. Besides this, my granddad’s odd behavior, and the freaking house disappearing, everything else seemed familiar. These were the same trees, bushes, and briar patches I would run through as a kid, but something just seemed….odd. It was something I couldn’t explain. Everything was the same, but it wasn’t normal. Maybe the color of the leaves was off. Maybe the trees were slightly taller. Also, what is going on with Granddad? I wanted to ask him so many questions, but I knew I would get the same deep grunts he would always give when I asked. Lost in thought, I almost ran into my granddad, who had stopped walking. Something was ahead of us.

I couldn’t see anything at first. Just a tree that seemed to have fallen months ago, indicated by the mushrooms latching onto it like a tick, sucking any life that was left inside. It rested over a hole that was probably left there by a stump of a much older, larger tree that succumbed to rot years ago. Then, the hole sat up. 

“Granddad, what the-,”

“Language,” my granddad said in his ever-present firm tone and started towards it. Not comprehending what was going on, I slowly and begrudgingly followed. 

As we got closer, I noticed the hole had an almost humanoid shape except for its head, which looked like a bird’s head with a long and thin beak, kind of like a kingfisher. It was completely black, and its outline seemed to be concave, as if someone had cut out a hole wherever it was. It looked as if I could fall inside it, sucked into its inky black space and shrouded in darkness, clawing at nothing to escape. It hugged one leg against its body, but its other leg was pinned underneath the tree. I was relieved. Whatever it was, I would rather it be pinned under the tree instead of stalking us. Suddenly, Granddad went right up to the log beside the creature, raised his axe, and started to hack at the tree. 

“Granddad, what are you doing?” I cried out at him, keeping an eye on the creature. 

He said nothing and kept chopping, refusing to acknowledge my question. I looked at the tree, which seemed to be about a foot wide. The creature just sat there, reacting to nothing.

“Again, what are you doing? Why are you trying to free this thing?” He stopped swinging his axe and looked at me.  Sweat started to form on his forehead. 

“Trust me, Ronnie.” What he said startled me. That was the first time he had ever said my name. We stared at each other for a few seconds before I gripped my axe and walked to the other side of the creature. I could feel its invisible eyes boring into my soul as my axe dug into the wood, splintering it and revealing the white-ish orange-ish meat underneath. I heard my granddad’s axe do the same. 

As we worked, I kept glancing at what sat merely inches away from me. Its beak was pointing directly at me, taking in everything, almost like it was curious. Light did not exist within this creature. In fact, it seemed to be sucking the light around it into its pitch darkness. On the log, there were numerous scratch marks as if it were using its hands, which I noticed were actually claws, to free itself. 

After about an hour, we separated the log from the rest of the tree. 

 I was nervous to free this thing, but Granddad told me to trust him, and I would do just that. I placed my hands on the log inches away from whatever that thing was, and, with a few grunts, we rolled the log off its leg. The leg was mangled beyond recognition. It formed multiple right angles, and in some areas, it was flat, almost like a cartoon. White bone stuck out in many different areas, seemingly just appearing as if they were coming out of a dark portal. Granddad opened his bag and pulled out bandages. Cutting a few sticks off a tree, he kneeled beside the creature's leg to make a splint. Its beak pointed towards him, and then its leg. The leg started to curl into itself with sounds of cracking and splintering loudly filling the area around us. The protruding bone snapped off and landed in the dirt, and the leg pushed its curled form and crammed itself into the bottom of the creature. It reached for its left arm and, and a sickening sound, slowly tore it off its torso. Bits of dark flesh stretched like cheese while within the holes, I saw the bone dislocate from its shoulder. After yanking the arm to free it from the last bits of flesh, it jammed it into where its leg used to be. It stretched its new leg, testing it. It then stood up towering over my granddad with its beak pointing down towards his head. He looked up at it.

It looked away from Granddad, then to its left, and with its new leg, pointed a long, crooked claw toward the woods. 

“Thanks.” He grabbed his backpack and axe and started walking in the direction where it was pointing. I quickly grabbed my axe and the canvas bag and followed, glancing back at the creature. It was still pointing, standing perfectly still like a statue, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was pointing at me. 

	

I wanted to question him. I wanted to know what that thing was. I wanted to know how he knew what to do, but I kept my mouth shut. It was clear to me that something was going on, and asking questions that would undoubtedly get ignored would just be a waste of energy. At this moment, I needed to follow my granddad and trust him, because for all his faults, I knew he would never lead me astray. 

Deep in thought, I almost didn’t notice the silence that loomed around us. The birds stopped singing, and the bugs fell quiet. As I tried to tune my ear to hear something, my eyes grew wide as I stepped on a twig and immediately looked at my granddad who noticed about the same time I did. The twig made no sound. It wasn’t just the birds and bugs that fell silent. It was as if the silence overpowered sound. I went to say something to my granddad, the words about to leave my throat, before he covered my mouth with his hand, using his other to put a finger to his lips. I nodded as he freed my mouth and gestured to follow him. I kept my head on a swivel, alert to any potential dangers that would threaten us, for if we are silent, everything else must be too. 

My eyes locked onto movement on the forest floor, and I tapped Granddad’s shoulder and pointed at it. We both started walking toward it with caution, and as we got closer, the more unnerved I was at our situation. A man wrapped in a dirty cloth was crawling on the ground. His skin was as gray as ash, and his eyes were blindfolded. He was missing his legs and right arm, which looked to be cut off as close to the torso as possible, while his left arm clawed at the ground, slowly pulling him forward. His hand was mangled and bloodied from the force with which he forced his hand into the ground. He left behind a trail as far as I could see, filled with small holes where he struck his fingers into the dirt. His body convulsed as he dragged it, and when I looked at his face, I couldn’t tell if he was crying or laughing, for no sound emanated from him. Following my granddad’s example, I fought off my fears and went to help the man, but my granddad stiff-armed me and shook his head. He pointed at another man a few feet ahead in a similar state, but instead, he was missing both his arms and legs, using his bloodied jaw to drag himself. I saw another, and another, and another, all of them in different states of amputation. They seemed to be moving in the same direction. 

I followed Granddad, who went in the direction the disabled people went. I thought I would have been hesitant,  but between trusting my granddad knowing what he was doing and my morbid curiosity, I was surprisingly calm. He stopped and leaned his head like he was listening for something, then turned to me and tapped a finger on his ear. I listened, but I didn’t hear anything. *Hum.* A single, low-pitched sound washed over me. Even in the overwhelming silence, I almost didn’t notice it. *Hum.* Again. The sound sent waves up my spine. *Hum.* Now that I noticed it, I couldn’t help but hear it pulsate in my ears. *Hum.* I wanted to sink into the sound. Let it take me. My granddad nudged me, and before us was a massive pit about as big as a football field. I didn’t remember how I got there, but I wasn’t too worried. *Hum.* The sound was a lot quieter now, but I could still feel it in my bones. I felt my granddad pull me back for some reason. It’s not like I moved. *Hum.*

I saw the amputees drag themselves to the pit. Hundreds of them. *Hum.* Their faces moved in agony, or pleasure, as they did not slow down when they got near the massive hole. *Hum.* They dumped themselves into the pit as they clawed over each other in a cacophony of flesh. *Hum.* It was as if they couldn’t wait to see what was in that hole. *Hum.* I… I wanted to do it too. 

I started walking toward it to join them when someone stood in front of me with his hands holding my head, forcing me to look at him. It was Granddad. 

“For God’s sake, Ronnie!” he shouted, shocking me to my senses. Immediately, the ground started to silently move like an earthquake. Fear started to creep into my brain, but something was holding it back, keeping me in place. Granddad grabbed my arm and started to run. His iron grip forced me to run or be forced to drag on the ground behind him. I glanced behind me, and I saw a huge mass of flesh coming out of the hole. It looked like a maggot the size of a skyscraper shooting itself directly into the sky, pulsating with every movement. Thousands upon thousands of human hands and feet seemed to grow out of it like hair, squirming, grabbing, and kicking into the air. It started to lean toward us and fall onto the ground, destroying the trees beneath it, shaking the ground, and we were just barely out of reach. The end that started to chase us opened up, revealing a mouth that was also full of hands and feet desperately trying to pull us in. I wasn’t worried, though. I’m sure everything would be alright. Granddad seemed to know what he was doing. To my displeasure, he still had a firm grip on me, forcing me to run. The grub was catching up, creating a warpath of splintered trees. Just when I thought it was about to catch up, it stopped. Its mouth opened and closed slowly like a fish begging for water, and its hands seemed to grasp at the air in sync with it. Yet, it stayed still. 

I saw my granddad take something out of his ears and stick it in his pocket. He looked at me and pointed at mine. I lifted my fingers to my ears and felt cotton and wax in them. I grabbed them and pulled them out, which turned out ot be a mistake. The deafening sounds of birdsong and the wind rustling through the leaves drove me to my knees. I tried to put my hands over my ears, but my granddad rushed towards me, footsteps beating my brain like a hammer, and grabbed my hands with a deafening clap, preventing me from any kind of silent relief. I thrashed and kicked, but he would not let go. I begged and pleaded, but he would not let go. Slowly, the noise around me started to become normal again. The birdsong and wind were soothing again. 

My mind started to clear up, and a wave of fear hit me like a truck. My eyes started to water, and I cried into my granddad’s chest. He held me close as I let out all my frustration through tears.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered into my ear.



We didn’t say much as the sky started to darken, but that was not out of the ordinary. I welcomed the crickets as their calming sounds washed over me, soothing the pain of complete silence. The giant maggot watched us for a while as we set up camp, with its hands desperately grasping at us, but it eventually wormed its way back into the woods. I asked Granddad if we needed a fire, but he simply shook his head and sat down. I joined him. After a rousing game of who can say the least (Granddad won), he pointed at the canvas bag I somehow didn’t lose yet. I handed it to him, and he pulled out a large sealed jug. He opened it with a satisfying pop, took a long drink out of it, then handed it to me.

“You want me to take a sip?” He nodded. I shrugged, placed the end of it to my lips, and tipped the liquid into my mouth. I immediately put the jug down when the hot liquid hit my throat and forced me to cough.

“You drink?!” I said in surprise. He simply nodded.

“Calming,” he said. Grandmom hated drinking. She said it made even the smartest people “stupid fools”. I took her worries to heart until I realized drinking would make it easier for me to talk to girls. Later in life, I learned she was exactly right. 

“Not only do you drink,” I said, taking another sip, coughing as I handed it to him, “you drink straight-up gasoline.” He shrugged and took another sip. There wasn’t more than a third of moonshine in the jug, but it was enough to make me lecture Granddad on the dangers of drinking for about an hour before quickly dozing off to sleep in a drunken stupor. 

Dew hung to my clothes as I woke up. I rubbed my blurry eyes and focused them on the ground. To my horror, Granddad was nowhere to be seen. I shot up to my feet and frantically looked around. He was gone. His backpack leaned against the jug undisturbed. I wanted to shout out to him, but I thought against it. The maggot couldn’t seem to cross whatever was keeping it from getting to us, but I didn’t want to risk it. Besides, what else was in these woods I didn’t know about? 

As I decided to look for him, a sweet aroma drifted into my nostrils. It smelled of roses and oranges, then switched to the smell of pot roast simmering on a stove. As the aroma changed again to the smell of freshly washed hair, I saw a woman gracefully and slowly walk out of the tree line. I was struck by how beautiful she was. Her long brown hair shimmered in the sunlight. It grew down covering her chest, and I realized the only thing that she was wearing was a skirt that stopped just above her knees. Her pale blue eyes seemed to look through mine and into my soul. I blinked, and I noticed her hair was now an autumn red. Was it always that color? 

“Are you lost?” she said with a slight seductiveness to her voice. Fear started to rise inside my chest. This wasn’t right. Another feeling started to rise within me, and the fear desperately tried to fight it off. 

“I’m not, but you should be,” I said, trying to rid myself of the shakiness showing itself in my voice. She stepped closer to me. Ebony skin, no, pale white skin, was clean and without blemish. Her light blue dress covered her feet, creating an illusion that she was gliding across the ground. She took another step toward me. I tried to step back, but instead I took a step forward. My feet would not listen to me. 

“That’s a little rude, don’t you think?” Her voice seemed a little high-pitched and playful. She smiled, and her nose wrinkled a little when she did. Did she always have a nose piercing? “I’m just wanting to get to know you.” Her voice was low and calming. My head started to feel dizzy. We got uncomfortably close to each other; her nose almost touching mine. I could feel her breath on my cheek. She looked up at me, her head level to my chest. Her brunette eyes pierced into me as she bent down as if to kiss me. This wasn’t right. Nothing was right. My head hurt, and I couldn’t form words in my head. Nothing came to me. I didn’t want to move. I wanted to run, but my head tilted back in anticipation. Then, for a brief moment, I smelled something rancid. Immediately, I balled up my fist and punched the woman in the face. 

An ear-piercing scream came from the woman as she faltered back and held her face with her hands.  Her body kept changing. She was tall, short, fat, skinny, black, white, yellow, purple, somehow at the same time. Granddad came up from behind me and held something to my nose. The smell made me throw up in my mouth, and after I swallowed the vomit back down, all I could do was gag. I figured it was to block out the smell that muddied my thoughts, and despite my body screaming at me to throw it as far away as I could, I held it to my nose once my Granddad let go. I nodded to him, and he grabbed his axe and held it tightly as he carefully approached the screaming woman. She didn’t even look human anymore. At one moment, her entire body looked to be covered in fingernails, then the next, she grew a countless number of arms, each holding a different kind of gemstone. She had four faces and four wings, glowing brightly when Granddad stopped before it, ready to strike it down. It started to say something, but I couldn’t understand it. It sounded like a million different voices in a million different languages were talking all at once, but soon, it settled on a voice I recognized.

Grandmom kneeled before Granddad with tears streaming down her face. With pleading and confused eyes, she looked up at Granddad.

“What are you doing, Rufie?” Unfazed, Granddad lifted the axe above his head.

“Don’t you dare wear her face, you harlot!” He said through gritted teeth as he brought the axe down. 

Grandmom’s face split into two, and her eyes bulged out of her head. He shoved the body with his foot and freed his axe; brain matter and blood pooled out of her head and stained her gray hair red. 

“Grand…. Granddad?” I said, worried. He stood there, staring at his wife’s lifeless body with her face disfigured beyond recognition. He turned to look at me with a stern expression, then looked at my hand. 

“You can let go of that now,” he said, gesturing to what he gave me to block out the scent, which I still held tightly in my hand. It was a large, green leaf folded over a couple of times. Curious, I unfolded the leaf and found a brown smear on the inside. Gagging, I immediately dropped it, wiping my hands on my clothes despite nothing being on them. 

“Is that why you were gone this morning?!?!” He nodded, and I saw something I hadn’t seen in a long time. Something I thought I’d never see again. Something contagious. Granddad was smiling. 



The forest changed as we travelled further in. The trees lost their limbs, becoming wooden poles with balls of leaves on the very top, resembling trees you would see in a child’s drawing. They looked like they were getting taller with every step. Rocks became more spherical with swirl patterns embedded within them, and there was less grass the further we went, bleeding into land that was just dirt and stone. In the distance, the forest stopped, and in its place was a giant, light blue wall extending into the clouds with seemingly no end. As we got closer, I noticed that the wall was *moving.* Standing at an arm’s length away, I could see that it was water. Color exploded from the coral reef that was within it, and fish of all different shapes and sizes swam as if unaware they were living inside an impossibility. I guess it’s not as weird as a giant maggot with hands, so who am I to judge the fish?

Granddad took his axe and slowly pushed it into the ocean wall. It went in smoothly, and when he pulled it out, the blade and the wooden handle were completely dry. He put his hand in it, and then his entire head. He gestured with his hand for me to follow him in as he stepped into the reef. 

It took me a few minutes to get used to breathing. Although it was exactly like breathing air, it still felt like I was underwater, and my brain had trouble processing it. Walking on the reef was what I thought walking on the moon was like: I felt a lot lighter, and I could jump high. Colorful fish that were surprisingly normal-looking swirled around us curiously, assessing what we were and if we were a threat to them. If this weren’t a life-or-death situation, I would have almost enjoyed myself. I was curious about why we didn’t float up to the surface and always seemed to land back on the ground, but I was also breathing underwater in an ocean that was cosplaying as the Red Sea from the Bible. Granddad seemed to know where he was going, for he just kept walking straight with no sign of a break. 

As we dove deeper into the ocean, the sunlight faded away, and the ocean became darker. Granddad took a rope out of his backpack and tied it to our waists, so we wouldn’t lose track of each other, which proved to be the right move as it became so dark I couldn’t even see my hand in front of my face, much less Granddad. The only thing I could see were little spots of bioluminescent light floating around us, creating the illusion as if we were walking around in the cosmos with stars watching over us. One of the little lights got close enough for me to see a little jellyfish lazily moving wherever the water would take it. It would have been peaceful if it hadn’t made me think of what else could be looming in the dark. 

Suddenly, all the lights went out at once, and there was nothing left but complete darkness. Judging from the rope, Granddad stopped walking. Uneasiness crept into my chest, gripping my heart, making it beat faster and louder. Granddad broke the silence.

“Listen,” I heard him take a deep breath. As he talked, he paused after every sentence as if thinking about what he was going to say. “I know what is happening is not normal. I haven’t been upfront with you. There is a reason for that. I cannot explain it. I want to. Up next, pay attention. There are rules. You must follow. Bad things happen if you don’t.” He paused for a lot longer than he previously did. “Ronnie,” A light started to glow behind me, revealing my granddad’s face. There were tears in his eyes as he looked at me. “Ronnie, I love you.”

Before I could say anything, another light started to glow behind him. Two giant, bulging eyes, each the size of a small house, glowed blue as their pupils focused on me. I stepped back, the rope tied to me keeping me from falling, as a scream got caught up in my throat. Its massive, bulbous head loomed over us, attached to a long, serpent-like neck which stretched into the darkness. As it opened its mouth, I could see sharp teeth as long as telephone poles escaping from its jaw as it moved closer to my granddad. 

“GRANDDAD, RUN!!!” I shouted as I turned to see another head already closing its mouth around me. All I could do was raise my arms to protect myself and hope that, somehow, it was enough. 

The feeling of being underwater disappeared. I slowly opened my eyes to see, well, nothing. Nothing but the color of gray spreading out endlessly as if I were standing inside a worldwide storm cloud. I saw Granddad standing beside me; the rope keeping us together was gone. I traced his gaze to see what he was looking at to discover a man walking toward us about half a mile away. He seemed to be in no hurry. I was about to ask Granddad if we should go meet him when I blinked, and his face was only inches from mine. Shocked, I let out a silent yelp and stepped back. The man let out an amused laugh.

“He reminds me of you, *Rufie.”* He said in a tone as if he were teasing an old friend. His hair was jet black and gelled to his head. His features were sharp, matching the navy blue tuxedo he wore. He was very handsome, akin to a model you would see in one of those weird cologne commercials. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Rufie?” The stranger held out his hand, expecting my Granddad to shake it. Granddad did nothing and just stared at him with an intense glare. The stranger sighed. “Well, it was worth trying. You already broke a rule, so I guess it doesn’t matter.”

Granddad’s eyes grew wide. 

“You didn’t notice? You said three more words than your limit,” the stranger said matter-of-factly. “That’s three words too much.”

Granddad opened his mouth to say something, but thought better of it and closed it. 

“Good on you! Wouldn’t want to make it worse, right?” He winked at him, then turned to look at me. “So you’re the new one? You look just like a young Rufie! I’m going to have so much fun with you.” 

“Who-” Before I could barely get out a word, the man’s face grew serious.

“SILENCE!” he shouted with authority.

My entire world went dark. I couldn’t see anything. I couldn’t hear anything. I couldn’t smell, taste, or feel anything. All my senses were gone. The only thing left was my consciousness. I started to panic, but I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t even feel my heart beating in my chest. Did I even have a heart anymore? Minutes went by. Hours. Days. Weeks. Nothing but my thoughts. I thought about what was happening and came up with theories that made less sense the more I thought about them. After a couple of days, I resigned myself to this existence. A couple more days, and I wanted something to put me out of my misery. I lost track of time. It felt as if I was in that torturous existence for years.

My eyes opened, and I shot up, feeling as if I had just taken a shot of adrenaline. I felt my face, my body. I could breathe again. I could see. I started to laugh. An old man was kneeling at my side with a panicked look on his face. I kept laughing. I couldn’t control myself.

“Not as strong as I thought. Poor boy went mad. That’s no fun.” Another man said as he snapped his fingers. I stopped laughing. My mind was clear, and I remembered what I was doing here. We were meeting this strange man, and I was with Granddad. 

I opened my mouth to say something, but Granddad put his hand over my mouth and shook his head. *Don’t say anything,* his worried-filled eyes told me. 

“I hope he is not smart enough to figure out the rules quickly. I got a lot more I want to try out on him.” He knelt beside me. He smelt like something was burning. 

“Now, Ronnie, there’s this game I like to play. Rufie here did it, his granddad did it, and so on and so forth. I‘ve played this game since the beginning of time, but I didn’t get popular until the Vikings gave me a name. The rules of this game are simple. *Figure out the rules.* That’s it. When you break one, you get punished. They won’t be as bad as I just gave you, but they will be punishments. Now, I suggest saying goodbye to dear old Rufie. He just lost, so I get to spend some one-on-one time with him. Good luck.” I blinked, and the stranger was gone. Granddad was, too. I was alone, sitting on my Granddad’s recliner in his cabin. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. I didn’t do anything but sit there for the next half hour, trying to wrap my head around what just happened. 

It’s been a few weeks now, and I think I have figured out a few rules. One of them is not to explain the rules, but hints are fine. Once this is published, I would have broken another rule, and I hope that by doing this, I can get Granddad back.

I don’t have any grandkids, so I hope that, if I lose, whoever plays the game next will read this.

We’re both 32, and as long as we’ve been together, he’s had the ambitions of being a writer and lecturer.

When we met at 24 he was doing an MA in Creative Writing and supporting himself with two hospitality jobs at the same time. I expected that after he graduated, he would switch to a 9-5, but stayed working in hospitality, which he has been doing ever since. For years I fully supported it, as it meant he had plenty of time to work on his writing. It meant a lot of compromise on my part; he would work most weekends, and his low pay meant giving up the idea of going on weekend breaks or to nice restaurants or anything remotely lavish, unless I was willing to foot the bill entirely myself. 

In the meantime, aside from attending a few workshops and sadly being unable to secure PhD funding, he hasn’t gotten anywhere with his writing career yet.

This week we found that the coffee shop he manages is closing down, so soon he’ll only have a few hours worth of temp shifts at another shop. I’ve been losing sleep because there’s no way we can survive on my average salary alone.

I feel awful but I’ve been feeling so resentful lately that he’s never tried to do more. Sure, he doesn’t want to do a desk job forever, but I wish he’d tried to get a stable, better paid job rather than constantly having to hustle to pay bills, just so he has more time to focus on his literary career that has no guarantee of going anywhere. And the thing is, he could write around work hours with any job, but he’s never tried to even get one.

Sometimes I feel so envious of my friends who are married to accountants and lawyers and programmers, partners who can provide for them and spoil them every now and then. I want more than anything for him to be happy and successful, but sometimes I wish so badly he just wanted something different. ",2,1755721732.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I have a FragranceNet coupon today, and I'm hoping to find her something like Jovan White Musk (her signature scent when I was a kid - I already got her a bottle of this and she loves it but the longevity is bad), but elevated. I don't have a huge budget, so I'm open to clones, cheapies, or anything that's a great price on FragranceNet. I'm probably looking at around $50 (and I'll get $25 off of my order).

Likes, based on other scented things she has, and her daily drinks: White musk, vanilla, fig, (she loves my Father Figure dupe!), coffee, caramel, cinnamon, patchouli (Mugler-style patchouli - she loves my dupe of the original Angel, as well as the current formulation), caramel, tonka bean. (she always has a caramel vanilla coffee with milk) I'm almost certain she'd love cashmere. She likes Cashmere Mist. She does NOT like rose. She may appreciate a spicy note like saffron or something, but that's a bit riskier.

What I'm considering: Eilish 1 (from the local walmart, not fragrancenet), a dupe of Black Opium (Maison Alhambra Opera Noir), Berdoues Musc Blanc & Lin, Cacharel Noa, Narciso Rodriguez for Her EDT, SDJ 40 or 59, Marc Jacobs Perfect for the nostalgic rhubarb, Lattafa Eclaire, Lattafa Her Confession. I have smelled Eilish and Black Opium, and I'm pretty sure those are ones she'd like. She stocked up on a hand soap that reminds me of a mix of their dry downs.

Not because it’s where the door is, but because it’s where the house pauses me — like it’s checking if I’m the same person who left last time, or a close copy.

The floor slants just enough to trip you if you stride in with confidence. The boards are darker here than anywhere else, the color of over-steeped tea, polished not by care but by years of weight pressing down. Stand still long enough and there’s a sensation under the soles — not quite a vibration, not quite a heartbeat. I tell myself it’s old pipes. The feeling keeps time anyway.

A mirror hangs crooked by the door. Its glass doesn’t just warp; it edits. My reflection stretches, trims, rearranges. The silver backing has peeled in mismatched islands where my face simply ends, as if the mirror gave up mid-portrait. The missing pieces never vanish in the same places twice. Last visit: no mouth. Today: the left jaw and a slice of my ear. When I tilt my head, the empty space tilts with me — respectful, accommodating. It’s nice to be catered to by something that shouldn’t know how.

Light in the entryway behaves like it’s under instructions. Even on clear days, it falls through the transom in thin, obedient threads. My coat’s shadow nods without breeze; the umbrella’s silhouette is longer than the umbrella itself. A sleeve lifts a fraction, then remembers itself and rests. I pretend I didn’t see that. The coat I don’t remember owning — long, heavy, anchor-colored — always hangs in the same place on the rack. If I brush it with my fingertips, the fabric is warmer than air, warmer than me. I’ve never put it on. I’m not convinced I’d get back out.

The air is layered: burnt coffee from the Present Room, the golden dust-breath of the Past Room, and that thin, sweet scent from far down the hall. The sweetness is migratory. Sometimes it’s behind me. Sometimes ahead. Sometimes both, like a person circled while I blinked.

From here, the map is plain:  
— To the left, the Past Room, its muted gold curling like smoke around the doorframe.  
— Straight ahead, the Present Room, restless, bright, already rearranging itself in my periphery.  
— And far down the corridor, the Future Room’s slim white seam — thin, steady, like a measuring mark on a doorframe no one remembers making.

The entryway isn’t a passage. It’s a waiting room that thinks it’s a judge. I stand until the house decides I can move. Or until I pretend I didn’t notice it deciding.

 

**The Past Room**

I don’t mean to go in. The door is always open anyway, like a suggestion I mistake for welcome. The light has the softness of a photograph palmed too many times — color rubbed from the corners, the surface slick with memory. The air is heavier than elsewhere, thickened by time until I have to shoulder through it, a slow swim. Dust here doesn’t settle. It hovers, attentive.

Drawers crowd the walls — some narrow, some file-cabinet deep — each brimming with scraps of handwriting: hurried, slanted, intimate. I know these pieces. I don’t know these pieces. A line I remember (“you are not as breakable as you think”) is gone; a line I swear I’ve never read before sits in its place (“keep the door open even when it hurts to look at it”). I tell myself I misremember. Then the new line blurs at the edges and rearranges itself into something different as I watch. I don’t tell myself anything after that.

The floorboards carry the shape of my tree tattoo in their grain — rings and roots, a familiar snarl. They groan with tone rather than noise: a low vowel when I step near the window, a higher, needling note if I stand too long by the chair with the threadbare armrest. The boards around the chair have learned my weight; they lift a little to meet me, as if my absence has been practice for this moment of return.

The window is painted shut, yellowed strokes as visible as old breath. Sometimes the glass is warm against my palm; sometimes it burns cold. It doesn’t rattle. It sighs, a sound too human for a square of pane. When I press my forehead to it, the gold outside whitens for a second — a flash like a camera. I’m never in the picture. I never check.

Objects in the Past Room have picked up habits. The clock on the shelf ticks with a heartbeat that doesn’t belong to its hands. The rug’s pattern rearranges its ivy a half-inch every time I blink. There’s a music box with no key, lid half-cracked, refusing both to open and to close. If I lean near it, a wet of sound starts behind the walls: a slow, wavering melody I almost recognize; the same tune I’ve heard only at the end of the hall. It doesn’t get louder. It just becomes more true.

Halfway across, I stop. The chair with the worn arm shows a folded scrap I don’t remember leaving. The handwriting is sharper than the rest, pressed hard into the paper. The ink smells like rain on iron. My name sits on the outside in letters that know how to be my name from the inside out. A corner of the fold curls, like a hand about to beckon.

I don’t open it. I back away instead, pulse the size of a fist. The Past Room tilts the tiniest degree toward me, a slope almost-nothing, like hospitality performed with bad intentions. A picture frame on the wall — empty — catches my reflection and trims it down the center. My two halves don’t agree which direction to turn.

I step out before the room remembers why it wanted me to stay.

In the hall, the sweet scent from down the corridor threads itself through the gold dust clinging to my clothes. When I look back, the Past Room’s door is fractionally closer than it was a breath ago.

 

**The Present Room**

Brighter, yes. Safer? Not a guarantee. Brightness tells a story; it doesn’t always tell the truth.

Light in here has moods: morning-warm, noon-clinical, late-day slicing across the floor like measuring tape. Today the brightness behaves like it’s auditing me. The walls are half-new, half-old — fresh paint settling against curling strips of what used to be. The uncovered shade is not uglier so much as blunt. I respect blunt.

The furniture is committed to micro-migrations. The table never sits under the same square of light twice. The chair leans closer to the wall when I’m sad. I don’t prove that; I let it be true. Three clocks tick in distinct tempos: a wristwatch by the keys (fast), the stove (unreasonable), and a tiny alarm on the bookcase (half a second slow, always). When they sync for an instant, the room inhales. The synchronization never lasts.

The plant on the windowsill makes a life out of refusing extinction. Leaves crisp at the edges, still angling toward light that sometimes isn’t there. On days I forget it, the plant leans farther, as if it could root into sun by intention alone. I water it with the gentleness I wish I invited for myself. “Sorry,” I say, which is accurate and not enough.

On the table: the chipped mug shrine. Inside, the matchstick — half burned, half blooming — has the posture of a relic. Sometimes I catch it smelling faintly of sugar, sometimes of rain, sometimes of faint smoke that makes my eyes sting. I’ve promised to frame it. Promises are easy to advertise and hard to keep. Lately I suspect I like it here, waiting, because waiting keeps possibility available like a light switch no one has to touch.

The oven carries the ghost of something left too long. It shames in small waves. The fridge holds the usual list: groceries, chores, names of people I should call. I cross off things that prove I’m operational. The names stay. They are the kind of items that resist the language of the checkmark.

Bleed-throughs have gotten bolder. At certain hours, a pale stripe crosses the floor that doesn’t match any window. It carries that same thin warmth from the end of the hall. It shouldn’t exist; it keeps existing. Twice now, I’ve heard the faintest drift of music — the Future Room’s tune — thinned to a thread you could break with a cough, but somehow intact. When it arrives, the clocks agree for one beat. The plant angle shifts toward the hall, leaf edges brightened.

I’ve lived in this room the longest. Today it watches back. The air feels like a dog’s gaze, head tilted, waiting for a cue I won’t give.

 

**The Future Room**

At the end of the hall, pretending not to notice me. The door almost closed, not quite: a seam of light, careful and exact. The spill is warmer at the edges, as if it has a pulse and is saving it for me. If the Past Room tilts to get me to stay, the Future Room waits to see whether I will move on my own. It knows I dislike being told what to do.

The gap has been narrowing over the years. I pretend not to see it, but I measure it anyway. One day, it will be gone. Doors close — not with a slam, but with a slow erosion you only notice when your knuckles meet the wall where the seam used to be.

Sometimes there is sound inside. Not loud: precise. A melody my mind wants to finish singing for it; laughter that might be mine if I ever learn to laugh without checking who’s listening. Sometimes silence, but a full silence, a silence holding its breath to avoid interrupting itself. Movement exists in there in a way that refuses description. I can’t see it. I can feel the air rearranging around it.

The sweetness threads out through the gap — stronger now, sharpened, a taste at the back of my tongue like the half-memory of a fruit I haven’t eaten since childhood. It is alarm and invitation at once. I step closer. I always step closer. My hand finds the knob the way hands find railings in the dark.

I’ve told myself for years that I’m not ready. It’s become liturgy.  
But lately, the thought comes with a shadow: what if readiness isn’t something you wait for? What if it’s something that expires?

Tonight, it breathes. Not old wood; not draft. Deliberate. Inhale. Hold. I forget for a second how to do either. When it exhales, the light widens, washing my shins, then my knees. The sweetness switches voltage — from scent to charge. Tiny hairs lift along my arms in the absence of wind.

The gap does not widen again. The door does not open. There is no hand on my wrist, and still: the sense of being near a threshold that recognizes my shape. Not just a you-may-enter sign. A we-have-been-waiting-for-you sign. And under that: a quiet, steady pulse of hurry. Not urgency that shouts, but the kind that will one day be gone, leaving only a locked door and the echo of a chance I chose not to take.

Something shifts behind the seam — nothing I can swear to, yet a rearrangement my body knows, like a room that has set out another chair at a table where you didn’t RSVP. For me. The table smells like citrus and ink and a little like rain. I can feel it — a place with my name carved into the wood, and the carving wearing smooth from waiting.

Tonight I stand in the Present Room. The pale stripe reaches my shoes. Behind me, the Past Room is quiet, as if exhausted by its own tricks. The plant is dutifully alive. The clocks nearly agree.

I think about tools. About hands. About doors built in places where no door was. I think about thresholds that are really invitations disguised as tests disguised as games.

I think about my matchstick, soft as a prayer and hard as an oath.

I turn. My feet take me backward, as if I’m practicing resistance or rehearsing return. Past the table. Past the plant. Past the peeling paint that will one day all be new. Past the open mouth of the Past Room, where the folded note has vanished or never existed. The air tastes like dust and fruit and something bright.

Until I’m in the entryway again.

The mirror meets me, corrects me. No warping. The silver’s islands have grown continents, a polished whole. The reflection is exact to the point of insult; it resembles me with no compassion. I reach up without thinking and the reflection reaches a breath before I do. A lag in reverse. I keep my hand raised. So does it. We agree to pretend we didn’t notice who moved first.

The light doesn’t thread; it sheets. The heavy coat’s hem lifts a fraction, then stills as if I caught it mid-confession. Beneath my shoes, the boards warm toward heat that feels recent. The heartbeat sensation in the floor and the beat in the stove clock line up for three ticks, and I hear myself breathe in a way that isn’t quite mine.

The outside door is behind me.  
The rooms still wait.  
Down the hall, the Future Room’s seam of light has thickened — not wider, but denser, the way fog becomes rain. I don’t know how many nights it will keep doing that.

I don’t leave.  
I don’t open it.

I stand where the house can see me, where the light almost reaches — warm enough to pass for welcome, bright enough to make me wonder what it’s hiding behind itself. A warmth that could be gone tomorrow.

For a moment, I see it opening — not a sudden swing, but the slow give of a door that’s been waiting for me all along. I picture stepping through. The air is cool and sweet and electric, like the first breath before lightning breaks the sky.

The thought steadies me, but steadiness feels like the wrong currency. The floor beneath me keeps its pulse, patient but not endless, as though counting down instead of simply counting. The mirror hums with my reflection — still perfect, still exact, still watching, like it might blink and find I’m not where I should be.

The light doesn’t come closer.  
I can’t tell if I’m meant to move, or if I already have, and just didn’t feel the step.

One day, the seam will be gone. One day, the table inside will clear my place and forget my name.

For now, I tell myself this is enough.  
But the house hears that, too — and I can’t tell whether it’s agreeing… or waiting for me to run out of time.

1mvq652,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingAddiction/comments/1mvq652/my_64_year_old_mother_has_a_gambling_addiction/,My 64 year old mother has a gambling addiction,"I’m posting here because I don’t even know what to do. I’m 27 years old and I was first made aware of my mother’s gambling habits when I was 18.

It came out suddenly when she got fired from her job of many years (cashier at a small local shop that sells everything from beer through bread through lottery tickets and scratch cards). It was caught on the CCTV cameras that she was committing petty theft, by pocketing the change that one would be able to get from returning empty beer bottles to the place where they were purchased from. We are in the EU, not sure how common this practice is in other places. She would cash in dozens of fictional bottles every day, mark them down as returned and take the change. Then, she would immediately spend that change on lottery tickets and scratch cards.

I was 18 when my dad and I found out and it suddenly made so much sense. Why I never got any allowance like my mates from school, why we could never get takeout or anything other than basic groceries. Why mom always said we don’t have the money for X.

She was very embarrassed and broke down crying, immediately started begging us to kick her out of the apartment and for my dad to divorce her “because she’s a disgusting liar” - in her own words. Obviously, we were disappointed but tried to understand where, when and how the addiction started. She promised to stop and said she will see a psychiatrist. 

I moved out of the house a few months later and found a job and started making my own money. My partner and I don’t make a lot, but for the first time since I was a child I was able to buy myself something because I wanted it, not because it was a necessity and it was such a surreal yet bittersweet feeling. 

I stay in touch with my parents and always have. I talk with them in the phone around once a week, I see my dad weekly and we go for walks or coffee. My mom and I were never that close. We argued about money when I was a teen, but once I moved out we never argued again. She was always a workaholic, working 12 hour shifts at whatever cashier job she currently had, but never having any money. Even going out for a coffee with her is impossible unless I pay for it. 

Obviously, she has been in debt almost constantly ever since then. Things were better for a while, I later found out that was because my dad agreed to pay off all her debts, which now I can see was probably a mistake. The issue is, neither me nor my dad know just how many cards and loans she has. My dad discovered in the beginning of this year that she is once again tens of thousands in debt. He again agreed to pay it off after her crying and being ashamed. 

Today, he asked me if I know anything about online gambling and my heart sank. My mother can barely write a text on her phone, but for some reason it was completely unsurprising to me that she got pulled into gambling apps or games.

I ended up giving my dad a lecture about addiction and therapy and we want to try to convince my mom to see a psychiatrist for real this time and to actually go to therapy. The thing is, I know how addiction works and until you admit that you have a problem and want to get help, no amount of therapy will help.

If you have any words of advice, encouragement, support or anything in between then it is very much appreciated. ",6,1755721333.0,GamblingAddiction,4,1.0,False

1mvq5ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mvq5ig/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_features_in/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle Features in Aarke Kettle Review,"The aarke 1244 has become part of my daily kitchen routine, and honestly, it’s hard to imagine mornings without it. This stainless steel kettle sits proudly on my countertop, with its sleek and modern design catching everyone’s attention. At first glance, I was drawn to its minimalistic aesthetic – it just screams simplicity and class. But of course, it’s a kettle, not a museum piece, so functionality matters the most. Luckily, this one delivers a solid balance of style and usability. 

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed is the stainless-steel finish, which not only looks premium but also feels durable. It’s compact, measuring 5.5 inches by 7.5 inches by 10.6 inches, so it fits snugly even in tighter spaces. I’ve used bulkier kettles before, and they were a hassle to work with on smaller countertops, so this size works perfectly for me. Beyond just looks, the 360° swivel base is genuinely practical, making it easy to lift the kettle no matter which way it faces.

If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably dealt with kettles that drip or splash water everywhere. That’s not the case here. The non-drip spout is a game-changer. It pours water with precision every single time, which is incredibly satisfying when making tea or coffee. Oh, and the smooth-opening lid? It might seem like a minor detail, but I loved how there was no mess of splashing hot water when lifting the lid after a boil.

**Heat Performance**

Functionality-wise, this is hands-down one of the quietest kettles I’ve ever used, and I’ve tested a fair share of them. Honestly, the double-wall construction must be doing something magical because, not only is it quiet, but it also retains heat exceptionally well. On mornings when I’m running late, I can pour a second cup of hot tea without needing to reboil the water all over again. It heats efficiently and holds that warmth for quite a while – perfect for multitaskers like me.

**Dry Boil Protection**

Safety was a big concern for me while choosing an electric kettle. I’ve had horror stories of kettles burning out because someone forgot to add water, and let’s face it, mornings can be chaotic, especially with kids running around. The dry boil protection feature on this one provides real peace of mind. It automatically shuts off if it detects too little or no water, saving not just the kettle but potentially avoiding a dangerous situation.

[Find the best price for aarke 1244 on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0cwhk6xzp/)

**Good Points**

Here’s what stands out for me:  
- The heat-retaining double-wall construction is great for energy efficiency and quiet operation.  
- The non-drip spout – no more messy pouring!  
- That sleek steel design is a perfect match for modern kitchens.  
- Dry boil protection, which is a lifesaver for forgetful moments.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**

However, nothing’s perfect, right? A few areas could use some improvement:  
- It’s a bit on the heavier side at 5.61 pounds, which might not be ideal for everyone.  
- With no adjustable temperature settings, tea enthusiasts might miss the flexibility to brew their green or white teas at specific temperatures.  
- The manual-only feature (no smart elements) makes it seem a bit outdated in today's tech-savvy market.  

**Competing Products**

When comparing it to similar products like the Breville Soft Top Luxe or the Fellow Stagg EKG, each has its pros and cons. The Fellow Stagg EKG, for example, offers precise temperature control, which the aarke 1244 lacks, making it more tea-friendly for enthusiasts. However, the aarke kettle’s double-wall construction and quiet operation outshine the Breville Soft Top Luxe, which, while also stylish, doesn’t retain heat as efficiently or run as quietly. If you prefer aesthetics with straightforward functionality, the aarke is a solid middle ground.

**Quality for Price**

Is it worth the investment? Well, it largely depends on what you’re looking for. If your main focus is durability, style, and energy efficiency, this product is a no-brainer. While it may lack some of the fancy features like temperature control or smartphone integration, it excels at the basics. It’s a reliable kettle that feels built to last, which I think justifies its price point compared to more budget-friendly, less durable models on the market.

I enjoy variety, exploring, and refuse to queue for food (I only made one res). I love the food scene here so much I’m going to miss it. Tell me what to try next!? 

**SAVOURY**

(1) **Lakruwana** (Staten Island)
I adore Sri Lankan cuisine, so went for the weekend buffet here and cannot recommend it enough. I also ordered the chicken kottu roti which truly is a must. The interior was very scenic, almost like a museum inside. The kottu was almost better for leftovers the next day.

*Highlight*: chicken kottu 
*Rating*: 9/10 

(2) **Hungry Thirsty** (Carroll Gardens)
I was sad to never try Ugly Baby on past trips, so I was thrilled to check out Hungry Thirsty! Loved it as I’m a sucker for spicy food (stay away if you don’t like chilli). IMO for something labelled “brutally spicy” the kua kling could have been hotter, but I have a silly high tolerance and it was still fantastic. Small space but a fun, vibrant vibe. FYI this was the only place I booked ahead. Also, don’t miss the (off-menu?) Thai iced tea slushy.

*Highlight*: Kang Tai Pla
*Rating*: 9/10

(3) **Yemenat** (Bay Ridge)
Wish I had come hungrier because the food here was delicious. I’ve been told the rice is a must. LOVE when a place gives you plenty of bread with a meal.

*Highlight*: Fasoolia Nashif with rashoosh 
*Rating*: 7.5/10

(4) **Hometown BBQ** (Red Hook)
I simply can’t leave nyc without hometown. I’ve been so many times and it’s never failed me. The pickles are addictive. 

*Highlight*: Pastrami bacon (not pictured here but was consumed with great pleasure I promise)
*Rating*: 9/10

(5) **Joe’s steam rice rolls** (Upper West Side)
Rice rolls are one of my favourite foods ever. I’m sure there are better in the city but these hit the spot and some. Big fan. If I lived here I’d come multiple times a week. Super quick service too which is appreciated. 

*Highlight*: All the sauces!
*Rating*: 7.5/10

(6) **L&B Spumoni** (Bensonhurst)
My favourite slice in the city perhaps because I love soft doughy carbs. I’m obsessed with their Sicilian slice. Perfectly soft dough, tangy rich tomato sauce and of course a great cheese pull. I of course waited for a fresh pie!! **Always ask for chilli flakes!!!!!** My fav is a centre slice (though I think I’m alone in that). 80+ years speaks for itself. ALSO **honourable mention:** the spumoni, which I couldn’t fit in the pics but is a must. 

*Highlight*: Sicilian slice
*Rating*: 9/10

(7) **Rosario’s** (Astoria)
Quick slices, not disappointed. Nice dough, suuuper cheesy (love that they make their mozzarella in-house!). Preferred the pizza slice over the grandma, though I’d get both again. 

*Highlight*: Pepperoni sausage pizza 
*Rating*: 7/10

(8 + 9) **Strange Delight** (Fort Greene)
This place was a gem! I went for lunch and had the ‘seafood and three.’ The seafood was *incredible* (melt-in-the-mouth fresh), but honestly the star was the cornbread. Probably the best cornbread I’ve ever had. I still think about it. It was so soft and flavourful and mmmmmm. 

*Highlight*: Cornbread 
*Rating*: 8.5/10

(10) **Westville** (Chelsea)
Okay hear me out with this one. Their kale salad is a fantastic combo and a nice reset amongst all the bagels and pastries and sugar. I always add grilled shrimp. Yeah it’s overpriced and you could make it at home, but sometimes you just want someone else to do the work (and dishes and shopping)…

*Highlight*: Kale salad 
*Rating*: 7/10

(11) **Thisbowl** (NoHo)
More salad, I know, but this spot is seriously good. I’ve tried all their bowls and can’t get enough. It’s not just TikTok hype. House-made sodas are also great. 

*Highlight*: The OG with miso glazed salmon. 
*Rating*: 8.8/10

**BREAD**

(12) **Apollo Bagels** (West Village)
Firstly, I know this is **not** a proper bagel. It’s sourdough bread in the shape of a bagel. BUT it’s damn good sourdough bread. Don’t get me wrong, I love a chewy NYC bagel, but sometimes something different is okay too!. Overhyped? Maybe. But tasty. Probably popular because their open-face bagels look more Instagrammable than a foil-wrapped sandwich but are not just style over substance. Better than pop-up (*which I don’t rate at all, they’re bland and meh, only redeeming factor is that they’re steaming hot. The cream cheeses sound fun but have always been lacking enough pizzazz*). 

*Highlight*: Sesame *bagel*
*Rating*: 7.5/10

(13) **Brooklyn Bagel & Coffee** (Chelsea)
Probably my favourite bagel in the city. This was an egg & cheese on an everything, but I enjoyed many other orders during this trip. Large bagels with great texture no complaints. 

*Highlight*: Truly any order. Go wild. 
*Rating*: 9/10

(14) **Tompkins Square Bagels** (East Village)
So close to being my top bagel in the city. If I want sweet, their French toast bagel is it. Trust me: French toast bagel BEC with maple bacon cream cheese (if available). Also love the everything pumpernickel. For wild cream cheese flavours, this is the spot AND they don’t skimp.

*Highlight*: french toast bagel BEC
*Rating*: 8.9/10

(15) **Hani’s Bakery** (NoHo)
Immediately goes in my top 3 bakeries of all time. The fluffy egg sandwich with bacon was beyond words. Don’t skip this!!! Their egg texture is incredible. Best BEC I had. You **must**  get the cookie (no photo, phone did not eat first). Cinnamon bun was jaw-dropping and not too sweet. Didn’t love the carrot cake (too plain, I like a spicier one), though others rave about it. Please try Hani’s it truly deserves the hype.

*Highlight*: Chocolate chip cookie
*Rating*: 9.7/10

**SWEETS**

(16) **Culture An American Yogurt Company** (Greenwich Village)
Probably my favourite iced dessert. I love froyo, but Culture is on another level. You can taste the quality and their in-house yogurt. This day was peach with blueberry pie topping. Perfect sweetness. I want this now. 

*Highlight*: Literally anything 
*Rating*: 9.8/10

(17) **Caffe Panna** (Gramercy)
I mean, it’s got to be good for all the hype. After trying their specials and scoops, the limited-edition soft serves are the winner for me. The passionfruit olive oil was the best I had. I didn’t want it to be great, but it is.

*Highlight*: Specials 
*Rating*: 8.5/10

(18) **Radio Bakery** (Prospect Heights)
Phone didn’t catch the smoked salmon focaccia but I really enjoyed that. The peach pastry was nice but not mind-blowing. Pistachio croissant was mid IMO.

*Highlight*: smoked salmon focaccia 
*Rating*: 8/10 for the focaccia. 6.5/10 for the sweets. 

(19) **Peter Pan Donuts** (Greenpoint)
A classic. I’m not normally a donut person, but this was excellent. Had the old-fashioned cake donut with custard, as well as the blueberry buttermilk (not pictured here). Custard stole the show because I am a fiend for custard. Also great value compared to literally 99% of places in the city.

*Highlight*: Old fashioned donut 
*Rating*: 7.5/10

(20) **Culture Espresso** (West Village)
Had to try their cookie since it’s so hyped. Really intriguing with a super crispy shell with gooey middle and loads of chocolate. If you prefer chewy cookies with more dough, maybe skip. But if you like a gooey choc-bomb, it’s worth it. Not as good as Hani’s IMO (I like chew), but still great. It was far better than Seven Grams. Slightly warm too so bonus points for that.

1mvq140,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/1mvq140/new_hearing_aid_directional_hearing_help/,New hearing aid - directional hearing - help!,"I’ve been profoundly deaf in my right ear since birth. As I also now have moderate hearing loss in my left, I’m having to use my hearing aid more these days (right side). I lip read really well, but I’ve lost pretty much all of the female voice range, so really need one for group meetings, etc.

My problem is that I was given a new NHS (UK) hearing aid last week that seems to be designed for brains that understand directional hearing. It’s one of these: https://www.oticon.co.uk/hearing-aid-users/hearing-aids/products/engage

All my previous hearing aids have had a setting to focus on the person in front of you. But this one just has “360 degree surround sound” that “lets your brain decide” what to focus on (?).

Well, my brain is focussing on EVERYTHING. I also have ADHD and my startle response is strong. I’ve spent the past week jumping out of my skin every time someone opens a door or clinks a coffee cup. I don’t think my heart can take much more of this, and I certainly can’t tell which direction anything is coming from or how close it is. It’s all just loud and alarming.

So, fellow SSDers for whom stereo is just an interesting concept, what do you think? Have you got a hearing aid like this? Is it possible I’ll get used to it? Will my brain learn? Or should I make another audiology appointment and see if I can get a different one? Thanks.",1,1755721028.0,MonoHearing,1,1.0,False

Most men who invite you to their house don't even have trash cans in their bathrooms they don't even know how to host a proper get together. Coffee dates feels rushed and performance.

  
Going on dates to places like amusement parks and arcades with men is annoying because you can't enjoy these activities at your own pace. It's fun to go with girlfriends, but with men, it's just draining. Plus men like to do a lot of physical things during dates like hiking date, a walk in the park etc. I feel like dating men is just doing a bunch of draining extracurriculars except you have an annoying man child with you. Most of the things women would actually rather do on a date men hate it. You can tell there is a shift in energy like if a women wants to do shopping, going to the salon, self care etc. I generally don't think men and women are compatible with each other. I think men just want to date another man.",14,1755720910.0,WereNotEmpowered,1,0.94,False

1mvpxm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTactics/comments/1mvpxm4/could_the_best_business_laptop_be_the_dell/,Could the best business laptop be the Dell Latitude 5420 Renewed,"Testing out the Dell Latitude 5420 on my desk for daily work tasks, I couldn’t help but reflect on my long history with laptops. Over the years, I’ve juggled a variety of computers, but this refreshed model from Dell stands out. Straight out of the box, it gave me a sense of reliability and power—a combination that’s often far too elusive in business-grade laptops. Being a refurbished unit, I had my initial hesitations, but once I got it powered on, those concerns started to dissipate.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing anyone would notice about this business laptop is its robust yet understated build. Constructed with a focus on durability, it doesn’t scream for attention, but that’s what makes it perfect for professional environments. Its sleek black finish adds a touch of sophistication, and at 4.74 pounds, it’s portable without feeling too flimsy. The 14-inch screen size strikes a good balance for frequent travelers like me who want something light but not overly miniaturized. Dell did a great job keeping this device slim at just 0.82 inches thick, making it slide into my laptop backpack effortlessly. After a week of heavy use, the hinges remain solid, and it gives off this feel of longevity that every business user appreciates.

**Performance and Multitasking Capabilities**  
Equipped with the Intel i5-1145G7 quad-core processor, this laptop is a workhorse for its category. I’m someone who always has way too many browser tabs open, files processing in the background, and Slack notifications bombarding me. Yet, the Latitude 5420 handled all of this without breaking a sweat. Its clock speed of 2.6GHz, turbo-boosted to 4.2GHz for demanding tasks, helps zip through processes remarkably fast. Adding 16GB of DDR4 RAM to the mix makes juggling between multiple tasks a seamless experience. Even when I loaded up Adobe Photoshop for lightweight editing, it managed to hold its ground. For a refurbished unit, I was pleasantly surprised by its capability. 

**Upsides**  
- Dependable build quality and portable yet durable design  
- High performance with the Intel i5 processor, ideal for multitasking  
- Bright and crisp 14-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920x1080  
- Fast 256GB SSD ensuring swift boot-ups and data access  

[Check Dell Latitude 5420 price on Amazon.](https://metaversegenome.com/p/b0f53sqrh4/)

**Display and Visuals**  
Dell seems to prioritize the viewing experience here, as the Full HD display is a delight. While working on documents, creating PowerPoint slides, or catching a quick YouTube video during lunch breaks, the visuals remain sharp and vibrant. The IPS panel provides solid viewing angles, which was a lifesaver during my coffee shop productivity sessions. Still, for anyone who’s into extreme color precision for tasks like photo editing, the brightness levels might feel a notch below what’s available in premium laptops. But for typical business or casual multimedia work, it’s hard to complain.

**Keyboard and Trackpad Experience**  
The keyboard deserves special mention. As a writer, I type—A LOT. The keys felt great under my fingers, with just the right amount of travel. It allows for quiet but tactile feedback, suitable for after-midnight work sprints when the house is dead silent. The backlighting was handy during those dimly lit hours, though the brightness wasn’t adjustable, which was slightly annoying. Meanwhile, the trackpad is decently responsive without being overly sensitive. It’s not a MacBook-caliber trackpad, but it certainly holds its own within Windows machines.

**Caveats**  
- Slight dimness in screen brightness for outdoor or color-sensitive tasks  
- Non-adjustable backlighting on the keyboard can be limiting  
- Some cosmetic refurbishing marks might be visible  

**Battery Life Analysis**  
Battery endurance is arguably the Achilles’ heel here. Pushing beyond 6 hours of medium-to-heavy usage proved challenging. If I attended virtual meetings, edited documents, and browsed simultaneously, it needed to sit on the charger by mid-afternoon. That said, lighter tasks like reading emails or web browsing did manage to stretch things closer to the 7-hour mark. It’s not painful compared to average business laptops but far from spectacular. I recommend keeping it plugged in more often, especially during demanding work sessions.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Exploring alternatives led me to directly compare this product with HP’s ProBook series and Lenovo’s ThinkPad E14. The ProBook is slightly heavier but offers a better variety of ports—and for someone constantly connecting peripherals, that could be advantageous. However, the Latitude 5420 outshines ProBook in performance speed due to its SSD and newer-gen processor. Meanwhile, the ThinkPad has a superior keyboard—the gold standard for typing—but felt clunkier in design. The Latitude feels like the perfect middle ground for individuals like me who prioritize smooth operations and portability over minute gains. 

**Value for Money**  
Price-wise, the Latitude 5420 is an attractive deal if you’re in the market for a reliable, refurbished business laptop. With similar configurations costing more among its competitors, this device delivers a balanced experience without draining your wallet. It’s not for gamers or design-heavy workloads, but for the corporate warriors, small business owners, or students needing a functional, long-lasting laptop, it hits the budget sweet spot effortlessly.

1mvpwou,https://www.reddit.com/r/amsterdam_rave/comments/1mvpwou/weekly_party_discussion_2224_august/,Weekly Party Discussion 22-24 August,"While half of the Netherlands is still nursing their Lowlands hangovers and flooding your feed with reels of memories they sort of remember, here are some events this weekend that are actually worth swapping your spot on the sofa and putting your phone down for. Seriously. Phone down, ass up.  

# Friday:

**Erika, BMG, Nawaz @ Garage Noord**

Reasons to rise from your digital dungeon begin on friday night at Garage Noord - Nawaz brings his sound journeys to the farthest corners of the Garage. He will certainly write a narrative throughout the course of the night until morning, where the dark shadows of Garage are about to get a bit brighter -  if you stick around for the sunrise set from BMG. It’s about to rewrite your weekend.  



# Saturday:

The day of many genres, there’s literally something for everyone.   

**Summer Dance Forever @ Paradiso**

It’s an international hip-hop festival with a variety of genres from the 19th to the 25th. Including performances, battles, and club nights, this weekend has a few highlights. On Saturday, the House Dance Forever Battles are exactly what you didn’t know you needed. The top 24 dancers will go head-to-head (substitute preferred body part here), and just when you think it becomes predictable the judges pick their partners and head for a 2 vs 2 battle (I’ll leave the body parts out this time), and the audience decides. Who wins? That’s up to you. After the battles comes a club night (starting at 23:00). Stay and it’s free, leave and you pay extra. Just saying.   

**SlapFunk WKNDR 3 @ Lofi**

SlapFunk’s birthday weekender is another good stop on Saturday including Benny Rodriguez’ classic sound, melodic with Alexander Skancke, house with DJ Senc, tech house with Ryan Elliott and atmospheric layers with Samuel Deep. It won’t change your life but it’s a decent solid swerve from your usual path that might change your weekend. Gefeliciteerd!

**LITHOS @ Raum**

If you’re searching for a Hardcore party look no further than Raum on Friday. A party curated by Dimme Van Harten, this night is a tribute to the chest pumping pulse racing genre that lit up the scene and is making a big comeback. It’ll definitely hit harder than your morning (or evening) coffee.

**Return of the storm @ Garage Noord**

And if you didn’t already have enough of your favorite garage on Friday night, you can return here for DJ storm on Saturday. Not for the weak willed, you’re either a drum & bass and breakbeat lover or… let’s just say bring earplugs and a safe word.    



# Sunday:

**PEEL @ De Fik**

The weekend isn’t over yet. PEEL is free, fabulous, and totally off camera so in case you’re feeling that itch to pick up that social media doom scrolling again, save it for Monday. There’s another dance floor to get your fix of connection without consumption. You’ll find names like Delano Legito, Jasmin, and CNVN b2b Cseil next to the pop up market of vintage clothing, jewelry, and art allowing you to leave with something more than your dignity (maybe?) and your dance moves.   

So ditch the doom scrolling this weekend and step into the vibrant world of lights, lasers and smoke machines. The real story isn’t online, it’s on the dance floor. At least make a new set of memories and questionable decisions to post about on the sub next week. See you there, don’t say I didn’t tell you.

1mvpw0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingMentor/comments/1mvpw0t/my_experience_as_a_new_grad_finding_a_job_canada/,My Experience as a New Grad Finding a Job (Canada),"Throughout my schooling for a BBA with a Marketing major (Canada), the conversation with my peers has quickly shifted from ""what type of work do you want to do after school"", to ""is it possible to even find a job""?

I graduated this April and wanted to share my 3 main insights on my process of fighting this torrential job market!

1. Applying on LinkedIn and Indeed will NOT get you a job alone.

If you are applying to jobs on social posting platforms, you aren't special. I nearly guarantee you won't have the most experience, enthusiasm, or well written resume. If you don't have a portfolio, make one. If you don't have the skills for said portfolio, work on them. Expect it to take a few months of applying to find the right position, but I would say for every application you do take a hour to work on a skillset. You can 100% sell determination and a self starter mindset by showing the initiative you have taken to employers.

2. Your Right, No one's hiring

Companies don't want to teach new grads now a days, nothing you can provide is better then what they have or could find with 3-5 years experience. Half the positions I personally applied for took their own listings down and reposted with only the amount of experience changes. Be different, talk about hobbies, personal interests, etc. to stand out. If I didn't build computers and 3d printers in my free time trust me, I would still be unemployed.

3. Passion Passion Passion

At first, I applied to every single position under the sun. I even got hired as a mid 20's male to cold-call female real estate agents to try and convince them to get Botox before their next promotional shoot (lasted 2 weeks there). In an interview, the passion you can have towards a cause, business type, etc. will really propel you forward. Ask everyone in a specific industry you want to enter to have a coffee to start getting your name associated with said industry. During these meetings, don't approach it like you want a job from the contact you're meeting with. Instead, go at it like you are wanting advice on how to enter a industry as a newcomer. Humility goes a long way.

At the end of the day each person is different but the reason so many people can't find a job in marketing is simple, oversaturation. You need to stand out to have a chance of going far, but most importantly be yourself and the success follows.",1,1755720727.0,MarketingMentor,0,1.0,False
1mvpviz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvpviz,One Room Left in Our Huge Ocean Hill Townhouse – Sept 1 or Sep 15th Move-In,"Hey everyone,

We just locked down this massive 2-floor townhouse on Fulton St. in Ocean Hill, and we’re looking for one last roommate to join us for the Sept 1 move-in. The place is amazing – hardwood floors, huge common spaces on both levels, in-building laundry, and even an extra bonus room that opens to the backyard.

The available room is super quiet, backyard-facing with two big windows, tons of natural light, and a double-door closet. It easily fits a queen or king bed, plus space for a couch or desk if you want. Rent is $1,175/month with first month + security to move in. Landlord just needs good income/credit (or a guarantor). No fee.

About the crew so far:

Lisa (22) – works at a smoothie bar + bartends, also an artist and musician. Super clean, outgoing but also respects privacy.

Evi & Jack (mid-20s, that’s me) – couple from upstate, both musicians into movies, hanging with our shy cat, Pippi.

Julian – just graduated from Ohio State, moving here for comedy writing & film. Loves standup, music, and keeping the place clean.

So the vibe is pretty chill, creative, and friendly, but we all respect each other’s space too.

Neighborhood perks:
We’re near Rockaway Ave (C) and Broadway Junction (L, J, A, C) so the commute is easy anywhere in the city. Daily Press Coffee, Beets Café, and All Night Skate are right around the corner, and Callahan-Kelly Playground with the new skate park and courts is nearby.

If you think you’d be a good fit, hit me up! We’re trying to lock this in fast so we can all move in together on Sept 1.",3,1755720696.0,NYCapartments,2,1.0,False
1mvpuzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mvpuzt/went_fishing_yesterday_for_the_first_time_in/,"Went fishing yesterday. For the first time in about 17 years, I wasn’t hungover or drunk.","I (35M) never realized how much I really enjoyed fishing, and I’ve done it my entire life. 

I’d forgotten what it was like to fish as a young man. Hangover free; just me and the water. 

I had this epiphany mid fishing trip. I haven’t been able to drink coffee for months due to health anxiety. Constant impending doom feeling / worried I was going to die, cardio phobia mostly. 

In the last two weeks, I’ve really started to turn a corner with my anxiety. I decided to drink a nice hot cup of coffee, even though I knew it could cause a panic attack like it had in the past due to being hungover. 

I ran toward the anxiety and faced it head on yesterday. I wholeheartedly believe the constant state of being hungover everyday led to my chronic health anxiety. I don't mean to go on a tangent about anxiety on a stop drinking sub, but this is a huge victory for me and probably the largest reason I decided to try to stop. 

I’ve always heard about the magic 60-90 days regarding anxiety reduction. Days 50-60 made me think it was a bunch of bullshit. I was really struggling with sleep and anxiety was through the roof. I never thought I’d feel this good if I powered through it. I decided to adopt a stubborn attitude and accepted that I was just going to feel like shit for the rest of my life. That helped me dig deep and not give in. 

Obviously, I know that I’ll have my ups and downs, but just the small fact that I can have a big cup of coffee and get outside and fish on the water all day, and actually enjoy every minute of it, is big for me. 

If you’re reading all of this and you’re struggling at around the 2 month mark still, just know that it will get better. I thought it was bull, but I’m living proof that it isn’t. Dig deep, hang tough, you can do it and it is totally worth it. 

Edit #1:
I'm a big timeline person. It will vary person to person, but here's mine if you're curious.

Week #1: Anxious, sleep deprived, tired, angry, agitated.

Week #2-#4: Happy, content, clear headed, no anxiety (pink cloud).

Week #5-8.5: Extremely anxious, fatigued, anhedonia, impending doom feelings.

Week #8.5-9: Calmer, no anxiety, restored energy, mental base line becoming restored.",36,1755720665.0,stopdrinking,2,0.98,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred
