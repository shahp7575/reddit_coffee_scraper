I started with 10mgs of Vyvanse for a week.

I couldn't really feel the effects of the Vyvanse other than not being groggy all day, so I got moved up to 20mg. I continued to skip coffee and eat a small breakfast, but I started feeling the physical symptoms of anxiety (tight chest, ball in throat, jitters, nausea) all day. I honestly feel more anxious about these symptoms than I feel about other big stresses in my life right now.

1jwdjk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnsonCountyNCHistory/comments/1jwdjk9/patrick_boggan_memorial_marker_in_wadesboro_nc/,Patrick Boggan Memorial Marker in Wadesboro NC,"One of the great mysteries of life is the memorial marker of Patrick Boggan that has been ‚Äúresting‚Äù for many years beside our Alexander Little (built in 1839) House at 206 East Wade Street, which is the location of our Anson County Historical Society office in Wadesboro NC. The Patrick Boggan Memorial Marker states the following; ‚ÄúCaptain Patrick Boggan, Patriot and Revolutionary Soldier Died 1817. He was Buried About Four Hundred Yards South of This Point. Erected By Thomas Wade Chapter, DAR, Wadesboro NC 1931‚Äù (This marker originally stood about 2 miles west on old US Hwy 74). When visitors read the inscription, they immediately look south, thinking they will see his grave.

The story I was told, Patrick Boggan‚Äôs memorial marker was placed by the roadside along Highway 74 in 1931 when Highway 74 West was only two lanes. In 1956 when Highway 74 became four lanes, instead of the highway commission moving the memorial marker over to the roadside, it was moved to the East Wade Street location.

Another mystery is, where was Patrick Boggan buried??? John Dunlap told me years ago that Boggan was buried in the woods on Coffee Pot Road in Wadesboro. Turn left at the Anson County School Bus Garage to Coffee Pot Road. Mr. Dunlap never did make plans with me to visit Boggan‚Äôs grave. Find-A-Grave info states that Boggan was buried at the Slaughter Hill Cemetery. Where was Slaughter Hill? In the 1800‚Äôs was the Owen Slaughter Family that lived in Anson & Richmond Counties. Slaughter Hill is in the vicinity of our Wadesboro Peaches & Cream on Highway 74 West & the old abandoned cemetery located across the highway with only one headstone was discovered about 15 to 20 years ago when CMH Flooring Company was expanding their building & Susannah May McLendon headstone was discovered. She died in March of 1858 & her headstone & any remains were transferred to Eastview Cemetery on Old Lilesville Road.

1jwdhl0,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/rfk-measles-grieving-families-texas/682386/,What RFK Jr. Told Grieving Texas Families About the Measles Vaccine,"On Sunday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with the families of two girls who had died from measles in West Texas‚Äîand raised doubts about the safety of vaccines. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in the vaccine anymore,‚Äô‚Äù Peter Hildebrand, whose 8-year-old daughter, Daisy‚Äôs, funeral had been held just hours earlier, told me. ‚ÄúI actually asked him about it.‚Äù

The secretary of Health and Human Services had traveled to the small, remote city of Seminole, where 1,000 mourners for Daisy filled the wooden pews of an unmarked Mennonite church. After the service, coffee and homemade bread were served at a traditional gathering known as a faspa. Kennedy was there, he wrote on X that afternoon, to ‚Äúconsole the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief.‚Äù

The slow-brewing crisis, in which more than 600 people have been infected with measles and three have died‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs first deaths from the disease in a decade‚Äîhas left Kennedy in an awkward position. For many years, he has been the country‚Äôs most prominent anti-vaccine activist. Americans ‚Äúhave been misled by the pharmaceutical industry and their captured government agency allies into believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, safe, and effective,‚Äù he wrote in a foreword to a 2021 book. Since taking office, though, he has moderated his tone, at times endorsing the shots‚Äô importance to public health. In his public post from Seminole, Kennedy did so once again, describing his department‚Äôs efforts to supply Texas pharmacies and clinics with ‚Äúneeded MMR vaccines,‚Äù which he called ‚Äúthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.‚Äù

Yet there‚Äôs ample reason to believe that Kennedy hasn‚Äôt really changed his views: ‚ÄúI have worked with Bobby for many years, and I can confidently say that he has a heart that is incapable of compromise,‚Äù Del Bigtree, the communications director for Kennedy‚Äôs independent presidential campaign, said on X, in an effort to reassure some angry and confused supporters. ‚ÄúHe is at a poker table with the slyest serpents in the world,‚Äù he added; ‚Äúwe should not ask him to show his cards.‚Äù (Bigtree also called the MMR vaccine ‚Äúone of the most effective ways to cause autism,‚Äù despite the fact that study after study has disproved the link.) Indeed, when I spoke with Hildebrand by phone on Monday, I learned that Kennedy was questioning vaccines behind the scenes, even in the midst of his condolence trip to Texas.

‚ÄúHe never said anything about the vaccine being helpful,‚Äù Hildebrand told me. He did not want to go into more detail about his conversation with Kennedy, saying he‚Äôd been advised (he didn‚Äôt say by whom) not to make any public comments. But he seemed to view the secretary‚Äôs statement as confirmation that the MMR vaccine is untrustworthy. Notwithstanding his daughter‚Äôs death, he claimed that the children of another member of his family, who were vaccinated, still got sicker in the recent outbreak than two of his own children who had gotten measles and recovered. ‚ÄúSo the vaccine ain‚Äôt about shit,‚Äù he said. A Health and Human Services spokesperson would not confirm what Kennedy had said to Hildebrand. ‚ÄúSecretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine, he is pro-safety,‚Äù the spokesperson wrote by email. ‚ÄúHe has consistently made that clear.‚Äù

Among vaccine skeptics, the death of Daisy Hildebrand, like the earlier death of 6-year-old Kayley Fehr, is being reframed as the consequence of a tragic and egregious medical error. Children‚Äôs Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Kennedy founded, has pushed the theory that Fehr wasn‚Äôt given the correct antibiotic for pneumonia soon enough to save her life, apparently basing that judgment on medical records the Fehrs provided to the organization. Covenant Children‚Äôs Hospital, where Fehr was treated, has called such claims ‚Äúmisleading and inaccurate,‚Äù while pointing out that patient-confidentiality laws prevent the hospital from going into detail about the girl‚Äôs treatment. Robert Malone, a doctor and former researcher known for sharing concerns‚Äîand misinformation‚Äîabout COVID-19 vaccines, posted on his Substack that Daisy‚Äôs death was ‚Äúa case of a child suffering from pre-existing conditions who was misdiagnosed.‚Äù (Texas‚Äôs health department says that the girl had ‚Äúno reported underlying conditions.‚Äù)

Hildebrand, too, blames doctors for the deaths. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to do any- and everything I can to make sure the hospitals start getting some ‚Äòact right‚Äô in them so nobody else has to go through this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey pretty much murdered them.‚Äù In the case of his daughter, he believes the hospital should have given her budesonide, a steroid often prescribed for asthma, among other conditions, that has been touted by Kennedy for treating measles. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt give her the budesonide breathing treatment that we‚Äôd been asking for,‚Äù Hildebrand said. ‚ÄúThey were saying that the IV steroids they were giving her were better.‚Äù A spokesperson for University Medical Center in Lubbock didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.
According to Michael Mina, a physician and an immunologist who studies measles, budesonide is not a first-line treatment for measles. ‚ÄúThe use of budesonide to try to treat measles simply does not, biologically or mechanistically, make sense,‚Äù Mina told me. ‚ÄúWhere it could potentially make sense is treating a co-infection that‚Äôs occurring in conjunction with measles, but that is far from a measles therapy. This is not something that we should be treating measles with.‚Äù Mina added that it is ‚Äúmuch better to prevent measles in the first place through vaccination.‚Äù

Hildebrand said that, before they took Daisy to the hospital, his family was given advice on her care by, among others, Ben Edwards and Richard Bartlett, two West Texas doctors whom Kennedy has praised as ‚Äúextraordinary healers‚Äù treating measles patients in Seminole. Edwards and Bartlett are pictured in a photo that Kennedy posted from his meeting with the two families, which occurred after the funeral at a steak dinner at the West Texas Living Heritage Museum, in Seminole. Like Kennedy, Edwards has raised doubts about the safety of the MMR vaccine and instead promoted treatments such as cod-liver oil, which is high in vitamins A and D. At one point, he was offering free cod-liver oil to Seminole residents at an ad hoc clinic next to a coffee shop.

Hildebrand said his family had been in touch with Bartlett and Edwards. Daisy was given vitamin A. ‚ÄúIt all seemed to work,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWhen she started needing oxygen so bad, we didn‚Äôt have the equipment at home, and neither did they have all the equipment at their clinics, so obviously we had to look for further help at the hospital.‚Äù In an email, Edwards denied that Daisy Hildebrand was one of his patients. ‚ÄúNo, I did not treat her, but plan to get the medical records to review to see if standard of care was followed or not,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs you know, standard of care antibiotics were not given to the first little girl that died, which lead [sic] directly to her death.‚Äù Bartlett could not be reached for comment; a clinic where he used to work said he was no longer employed there.

Dean Boyer, the funeral director who handled the services for both girls, was present at the dinner where Kennedy met with the Hildebrands and Fehrs. He said he overheard the secretary‚Äôs conversations with both sets of parents. ‚ÄúHe never asked pointed questions: Are you vaccinated? Are you not? He just told them how sorry he was,‚Äù Boyer told me. ‚ÄúHe even met with the kids alone, just sat‚Äîa ‚Äòpawpaw minute‚Äô is what I called it.‚Äù Boyer praised Kennedy for attempting to keep his visit under wraps. ‚ÄúHe tried to get in as quiet as he could, because he didn‚Äôt want attention.‚Äù

It‚Äôs true that Kennedy mostly dodged reporters, but of course his trip was not a secret. After the dinner, he posted a long message on X about the ‚Äúwarmth and love‚Äù he felt from the community and about how he had ‚Äúbonded with many of these resilient, hardworking, resourceful, and God-loving people.‚Äù He also shared several photos of himself embracing the families, one with a boy on his knee, another with his arm around Hildebrand. Whereas some of Kennedy‚Äôs earlier comments about the outbreak have seemed callous‚Äîcalling it ‚Äúnot unusual,‚Äù for instance, or suggesting without evidence that Kayley Fehr might have been malnourished‚Äîthese conveyed the image of a government official who cared.

When I spoke with Hildebrand, he said he didn‚Äôt know that the secretary had posted photos of his family, or that Kennedy had given out Daisy‚Äôs full name. He said that he hadn‚Äôt wanted ‚Äúany of this on the internet from the get-go,‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt blame Kennedy. Instead, he directed his ire at reporters. ‚ÄúMost of y‚Äôall are fake media, and I don‚Äôt need my daughter‚Äôs name out there to be reported crap on,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt need anybody talking negative about my daughter. She‚Äôs in the ground.‚Äù

As some of you may know, I've been working on a fanmade reboot to Object Terror. I call it ""Object Terror Reloaded""! By now, I have finished the script for the first episode, and want to start working on it as soon as possible. Yet, I can't voice act for the life of me, and I don't want to have to use subtitles for dialouge as that would bore the hell out of the viewers. So, I have decided to accept voice auditions!

Basically, find the character(s) you want to voice act and match their voice qualifications. To apply for a position, DM me stating which character you want to audition for. Send me a [Vocaroo](https://vocaroo.com/) link containing the audio file of your enactment of the example line you are not a controversial or malicious figure, I will take a quick dive into your Reddit account posts. If you pass the background test, and if your audition satisfies my vision, you will be invited into a group chat made for the show's production, where you can chat with other members of the crew!

Here's a list of each character, their voice qualifications, and example lines! In advance, I'd like to say that ""casual voice"" means how you would normally speak . Basically, quirkless. I would also like to say that the voice qualifications do not mean it's the entire character's vocal personality. They should still be able to feel emotion. Anyways, onto the list!

|ZingZang (replacement for Skittle)|Feminine or androgynous-sounding (choose one), high pitched voice.|""Staplers aren't edible, are they? Now mind your own business.""||

\* Unibrow is a gag character, meaning he only exists for a one-off joke. So, if you chose to voice this character, you must also voice another character too.

If you are wondering why El Nudelo Spider and Plug are exempt from this list, El Nudelo Spider is not a character in this reboot, and Plug is meant to be mute.

Now, here's a list of...

|VOICE ACTOR QUALIFICATIONS|
|:-|


* As the show is aimed at a teenage audience, you must be **13 years of age** or older to audition for the show. As I am a minor who wishes to stay safe on the internet, you **cannot be older than 25** either (by the time you audition). If you do not meet the age requirements, your submission will be rejected automatically.
* When I run the brief background check on your account, I will look for the following to determine whether you are worth hiring:
* \~\~\~ **Traits I look for**:
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Signs of reliability and trustworthiness
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Positive engagement
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Collaborative attitude
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Inclusive and non-discriminatory values
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Experience with voice acting (Optional, but helps your chances a lot)
* \~\~\~ **Traits I would reject you for**:
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Toxic behavior (trolling, discriminatory values, posting offensive content)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Being under/overage
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Over-commitment (e.g., being involved in too many projects would get you rejected as I do not wish to overwork someone)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Having a criminal history on a felony level (U.S. and Canadian law will be the base for determining this)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Having a history of leaking or spoiling media (e.g., recording an exclusive theatre screening of the latest BFDI episode and uploading it onto your account, or leaking scenes or screenshots from shows you worked on but do not own).
* \~\~\~ Please note that, for your privacy, I will not be looking into any offsite accounts you own. **This is, unless, most of your only activity happens outside of Reddit, in which case you are to tell me that.**
* You must realize that **you will not be paid for your role,** as I am a minor and cannot legally own a PayPal account or something.

There is no set deadline for auditioning. I will close auditions once I have chosen voice actors for every character. Good luck to those auditioning! :3",2,1744331955.0,ObjectShows,1,1.0,False

I want her to always see a book in my hand, a book laying around bent and stained and used. I‚Äôm thinking about getting the CATS22 or whatever its called. We get one life, I mean this is absolutely fucking insane. I‚Äôve developed a really really rare and scary health problem post partum which sent me on an absolute spiral searching everything about it on reddit and it ruined me. I wrote this down in the midst of that time: ‚ÄúThe thing is, all your fear is coming from information you‚Äôve gathered on the internet. If you didn‚Äôt have the internet and you were simply living, you wouldn‚Äôt have any of this fear. In trying to gather as much information as you possibly could in order to control the situation, you gathered an insidious amount of negativity. Extreme negativity. Phrases you can‚Äôt escape from, phrases that push themselves to the forefront of your mind and push out all other thoughts (ALL other thoughts. All hobbies, all excitement, all present living). Phrases like ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù, ‚Äúsuicidal‚Äù, ‚Äúwheelchair‚Äù, ‚Äúlife is ruined‚Äù, ‚Äúextreme pain‚Äù, ‚Äúyou are fucked‚Äù, etc.‚Äù The things I‚Äôve read about my illness have been 1 million times worse than my actual illness. I thought I was doing myself a favor gathering as much info as possible but I did the opposite. I‚Äôve deducted that even if 1% of the info is helpful, it‚Äôs not worth the 99% devastating negativity I came across. I always convince myself to keep reddit or youtube or whatever. I always reference the positive stuff but ultimately the cons drown any good stuff hands down and byfar. I want out. I want out so bad. It‚Äôs sick. I‚Äôm getting there, I can feel it. I felt the same about Xanax. I fucking loooooved Xanax but I wanted out soooo bad. I ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt‚Äù though. But then I finally did. I can feel myself getting there with tech. Idk, thanks for listening. Life can just be so good and man what a waste. I could go on forever. ",4,1744331859.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm considering doing cupcake catering and home deliveries starting in April, but not sure if there would be an interest.

I‚Äôd sell them by the dozen for home delivery on the weekends and offer new flavors each week. You‚Äôd have to submit your order by Thursday afternoon, then I‚Äôd deliver them Fri-Sunday. 

This group has been so helpful with feedback that I figured I‚Äôd pitch it here first! Here are some of my most popular flavors:

1jwd99l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jwd99l/my_30m_parents_50f_and_51m_cant_seem_to_get_along/,My (30M) parents (50F and 51M) can't seem to get along with it understand my wife (25F),"So some context, my wife and I just recently married. We weren't interested in doing much for a wedding and had put off getting married for a while and so recently just decide to sign the papers and then have a vow exchange later in the year with family and a nice dinner. We have been together for a little over 3 years now and were engaged for half that time before getting married. 

Pretty early on my at the time gf realized that the frequency that my family wanted to do things wasn't for her as she is not the most social and social gatherings can stress her out. She really prefers just being home with our cats and only occasionally going out and doing things but likes usually a few weeks of down time before doing anything else. She has a diagnosed anxiety disorder and religious trauma as well so that feeds into some of her feelings as things came up with my family. Also we are not religious, but my family is and it wasn't until sometime into our relationship that I had to come out to my parents as an atheist. Something I had been afraid to do for a while. We also have a lot of different values and our political beliefs are very different, but I had been in kind of ""don't talk, don't tell"" understanding with my family. 

My family has always been very close knit but I have definitely pulled away over the years even before meeting my now wife due to life experiences opening my eyes to a lot of different truths, going through college, and then, of course, from deconverting. There was always this feeling that it was safer to just not talk about things then to get into big multi-hour long discussions debating some topic as I have had to do to defend beliefs they disagreed with, and I always feared hurting my mom's feelings with things which is a trend in my family to try to avoid. I would still come around for holidays, birthdays, and things but I definitley preferred staying home where I lived about an hour and a half away and my time on my own or with friends.

The first big ""fight"" my family and gf had was that at the time my sister went off and got engaged to someone she shouldn't have and moved quite a ways away and was going to have the wedding there. She is thankfully not with that person anymore and is in an much better place, but she did text me at this point to let me know about wedding things and to see if my gf at the time would want to be a bridesmaid (which she declined due to anxiety around being up in front of everyone but appreciated the offer). However, the next text from my sister asked me if I would want my gf in the wedding photos which I interpreted as asking if I was really serious about her whereas my gf felt weird as the question implied we might break up so I wouldn't want to risk her being in those long term photos. This became a whole fight and in this situation I think everything was just a big miscommunication, but my sister ended up calling very upset with that being how my gf felt she was trying to say and then it ended up my mom calling upset and more or less yelling at us about it hurting my sister. It all resolved once I could get everyone to just talk about their feelings and intentions, but I had to call my sister and mom seperately on my own and talk for hours. My gf ultimately apologized for misinterpreting things and just how the whole thing went. My mom and sister said nice things about it and not to worry about it, but never apologized for their level of reaction even though peace was made.

From there, my gf initially did her best to maintain the ""just showing up and avoiding topics and things"" strategy with me to keep the peace and not cause problems but as time went on, the mentioning of God this, God that would bug her some, and there were times where topics would come up that my wife had some experience in but her thoughts or comments would be debated or disregarded. An example is that her thesis showed how redlining was the cause of such drastic neighborhood conditions in the city we live in which was brought up when my dad asked about why the neighborhoods here would go from nice to run down back and forth depending on the street/area. He treated her work with disregard which hurt her feelings and made her feel like her work was being invalidated. Once or twice as well, politically related things briefly came up and some responses from both sides were hinted at but not debated or anything like that. During this time, my gf even went to church with me and my family a couple times but neither instance went well and tbh I hadn't realized how weird church would feel after being deconverted and just how much I didn't used to see that was questionable at best and problematic at worst that they would say. So going to church with my family quickly came off the table though we still at this point weren't fully explaining why to them.

She started to get anxious whenever stuff with my family was going to come up like a family dinner, birthday, or holiday so we decided to start to just have her not go to as much and let them know she didn't feel up to it or something similar. She also got a nasty bacterial infection at some point during this time period so she also at times just was too sick to go and even did go to a dinner with us all when she really shouldn't have but before we knew she had the stomach infection. She also tried to have a relationship with my mom through texting and updating about stuff we were doing and stuff. However, I believe that from the earlier interactions and then my gf not wanting to go to everything my family did, they started to think she didn't like them/not like her more and more. My family did always say she was welcome and have tried to make her feel welcome at their home, but since my gf was still under the mentality of trying not to cause problems, she didn't feel she could bring up things she was uncomfortable with and just had to deal with those which became progressively more difficult for her to maintain. This is something I regret as she was doing this for my sake whereas she would have brought things up sooner though idk if there would be a different end.

This is where the next fight between her and my mom occurred. My mom said she had wanted to eventually go on a mission trip to Egypt. My wife talked about how she thought it would be cool to go there but she had decided she probably never could due to how women can be treated there and mentioned that there was tons of other things to consider too like all the vaccines and things she'd need to get to go so it was a lot to do to be able to go but that my mom should do it if she felt she could/safe to. Well my mom responds with a comment about how she is not sure she could go in that case as she doesn't trust vaccines anymore. Which took me by surprise as my dad was involved in the medical field and I was a science major in college. My wife responded with ""Well they are safe so there isn't anything to worry about but you should always consult a doctor"" and sent some sources as well. It then became a back and forth of ""well I think this new claim"" one of which hinted at the whole vaccines cause autism thing and then my wife would feel she had to refute the new claim until it was just a whole argument with my mom saying things like ""You just don't respect my life experience"" and giving anecdotal things like how her school psychologist friend had seen something at a conference and begun doubting that vaccines and autism weren't related. This was right before bed so we eventually fell asleep but woke up to a text to both my wife and I in a new group chat from my mom she sent at 3am about how disrespected she felt and a variety of other random religious things and claims. I ended up having a long back and forth with my mom about everything and eventually it ended up with me coming out to my mom about being an atheist and sending lots of sources backing up vaccines as a legitimate science and such. 

Ultimately, I realized that we needed to have a sit down conversation and just be open and honest about pretty much everything as my family wasn't aware of my wife's religious trauma or anything about the sorts of things they said and did that would make her feel uncomfortable. So we set a date, picked a neutral location at a coffee shop (this spot I do regret as it wasn't the best and busier than I had hoped), and met up. This conversation did not go well. For one, they were initially weird about where we chose which in some ways was fair but us wanting a neutral location was so that in case the conversation didn't go well, we wouldn't have to have a blow up argument at our home and then have to ask my parents to leave. Well the conversation starts and things start okay, it seems we are going to be listened to about how my wife has felt and where we have differences and how we think it's probably best we all just avoid topics to the best of our ability that could lead to arguments, but then we get to religion and my wife brings up that things that had been said at their church put her off (in this case about how it isn't ""optimal"" that a women works and used some clips from Modern Family to hint that a gay couple were also less ""optimal"" than a ""traditional"" straight family) to which my parents just say ""Yeah we agree with that"" which was a given but my wife was giving the context of how she was forced to go to more intense churches and how things like this or other things made her not like church or the people who went to them so she would rather just not know what they believe so we could all just play nice. My wife is also bi and came out to them here. My wife is crying heavily at this point as my parents keep trying to interject asking things like ""So you just want us to change what we believe"" or ""Well we love people regardless of if we agree with them"" or my mom's favorite ""I think it best not to put those sorts of burdens you have on other people"" talking about her traumas. While my wife is trying to respond through the barrage of questions and statements and her own sobs, my dad starts staring at me like ""This is ridiculous. Why did you have us come here for this?"" and then scoffs/laughs a bit like the situation is ridiculous. 

This is when my then fianc√© was done and got up and left. I didn't follow intially which I deeply regret now as I was just stunned and overwhelmed. They continuted to talk at me for another few minutes telling me how it seemed like she just didn't want me to have a family (btw we don't want kids so this is also something my parents aren't super thrilled about but I'm sure they also meant my current immediate family as well) I tried my best to listen and explain my thoughts though they were fragmented and jumbled at best but also I didn't really know what had happened. My fianc√© had left, and I hadn't talked with her to understand what exactly was the thing that made her want to leave. I eventually got us all to leave and said I still loved them and stuff and went to get my fianc√©. She explained what happened and why she left and I definitely understood her position, but I was also still reeling from it all. Something I have come to notice now is that with stuff like this with my family, I often struggled with knowing what to think. I have had so many ideas of them and growing up expected they would be more open and accepting of a woman I brought into my life as I hadn't encountered these sort of situations. When things get stressful in confrontation too, I seem to freeze up and not know what to say or do. Something I am working on.

Some texts were exchanged one with my dad sort of apologizing as in he said the words ""sorry"" but also saying the line ""I don't know why/how you would bring someone around who sees so many faults in us"" so it has always been kinda hard for me to say he has apologized. Tbh even to this day our relationship hasn't really improved but we have been around each other and just pretend nothing is wrong basically. My mom was better at apologizing and extending hope for reconciliation. Things stayed tense for a while, but miraculously they did eventually lighten and improve. As Christmas was approaching, my wife obviously didn't want to go to my family's so I would have to go alone and she would be alone Christmas morning if I were to go. I quickly realized this didn't sit right with me and that it wasn't fair to her. I decided that I needed to either convince my mom to listen to what we actually wanted them to understand from the failed conversation and how my dad messed up to try to at least get enough for my fianc√© to feel comfortable coming. After a 2 hour long conversation, we finally came to an understanding and she gave my fianc√© a proper apology with plans to try to keep talking so that they could better understand each other and some semblance of hope was restored. Christmas went fine and everything since then has just been normal life.

We eventually got married between then and now to which my parents never did congratulate us which did feel weird but I chalked it up to they would whenever we had our vow exchange later this year with both families there. Btw neither one of our families was involved in us getting married as we just signed some papers. Her grandpa acted as notary but that was primarily out of convenience though he is a cool guy. We had at one point started to try to plan more of a wedding but we both realized that neither one of us was very excited about the idea and that I was mostly just wanting to do it cause it was what my family expected. So to be true to what we actually wanted, we just did it ourselves.

Until last weekend. My wife was invited to my cousin's baby shower. She felt she should go as it was a cousin of mine that I used to be close with and her mom had reached out to me specifically to invite her. We knew it would be a difficult environment for my wife as I have 6 aunts on that side of the family and lot of cousins, but she decided she should give it a shot. We made it clear that we were trying to leave our car with my wife so if she got overwhelmed she could just leave which they said made sense. She had been feeling stressed about it leading up to it and so we made sure we had a plan for her to leave if she needed to. Apparently my mom decided to get us guys an axe throwing session so I wouldn't be staying with my wife which I wish I had, but she said she would be okay and let me know if she got overwhelmed and had to leave. 

Well I eventually start getting texts from her that she isn't having a great time, that my aunts are loud so she can barely hear people and were being a little too intense for her, and some of the ways and things they were talking about felt odd to her. It also turns out that my aunt's husband was sick and hiding back in another room which my wife would have liked to have known as she is prone to getting sick and we have a friend going through chemo. My family just told her it just a was a cold, some of them were immuno-compromised too, and it was fine cause he worked in a hospital which didn't help her feel better. She eventually started to get overwhelmed and could tell she was going to have a panic attack so pulled herself together enough to thank my cousin for inviting her and telling her congratulations before leaving. She called me trying to calm down and asking where I was so she could come get me. I let my dad and brother know as they were about to get food so they left while I waited and then we head back to my family's house so I could say goodbye to them before we headed back home. They said okay and asked ""Did she tell mom?"" to which I said I didn't think so but we also hadn't heard from her. My sisters boyfriend said good bye and gave me a hug as I left. I called my mom after that to tell her we were leaving and kinda explain what had happened. She just said ""Okay, I gotcha. I love you."" My brother later texted my wife to check on her though he doesn't agree that how my aunts can be can be kinda unhealthy (my wife felt that they could be a bit pushy and intense as well as she felt it was odd they were talking about circumcision so openly and saying things about how much harder girls can be to raise when all of their daughters were right there). My mom never reached out to my wife.

My wife decided that after we got home and calmed down that she should reach out to my mom, let her know why she left, and also she did feel it would have made her feel cared for if my mom had texted her to check on her at some point or thought to ask her sisters to try to be a bit quieter. My wife also was realizing that those sorts of bigger family gatherings probably just weren't for her and that she wanted to let my mom know as she likely would want to skip the big family Thanksgiving and it wasn't because my immediate family had done something, but just that she knew it wasn't for her. She was also going to offer the idea that she could come the next day for like a leftovers of Thanksgiving kind of thing with just my immediate family (I would have likely gone to both). Well this was another conversation that did not go well. 

The goal of this conversation was just to update my mom, express something that my wife had felt made her feel a little uncared for, and just continue with what my wife and my mom had said before about letting each other know what sort of things they did and did not feel comfortable with. Well my mom interrupted my wife only a few minutes into the conversation and her explaining her thoughts to talk about how close her and her sisters are and how they can just be like that and razz each other but it is all in good fun and they can do it because they are so close. Which I mean sure that can be true, but my wife can still not enjoy that environment. My mom continued on saying that they shouldn't have to change or adjust to her and thinks my mom or wife asking people to be quieter would have been too much and rude. She said she was just ""focused on my cousin and making it about her"" and that my wife just wanted to make things about her. She said things like how my wife just didn't have the life experience she did to understand these sorts of things and how she just shouldn't take offense and ask so much of others. My wife at this point is starting to shake and hands me the phone to which I try to talk about some of how I have felt with my family but my mom also interrupts me and my wife just breaks and starts yelling at the phone I am holding, ""Let us talk! Let us fucking talk! Son of a bitch, let him talk!"" That sort of thing between starting to cry and hyperventilating now too. Now here is another place where I wish I was better at acting in the moment and defending my wife some as as I didn't do much of anything other than motion for my wife to try to back off and tried to get back into the conversation. I wish I had ended the call earlier when I saw my wife starting to panic, but I also wanted to try to say my thoughts. But my mom was just going on saying things like my wife wanted to ""tear the family apart,"" ""censor them,"" and that my wife was a ""narcissist"" before we ended the call. I have since had a back and forth about how my brother heard the call and thinks I shouldn't have let my wife talk to our mom like she did and my dad has reached out saying he would like to talk but also understands if I don't want to.

How I have come to feel is that we often try to come into these conversations with a general, fair goal in mind, some aspects of what we say gets targeted and pulled to an extreme before we can explain our full point and thoughts or respond, and things just become a jumbled mess that I can't keep track of everything being said what needs to be addressed while we are villianized. I am also realizing that I think my parents have disliked my wife longer than they let on initially and I have to wonder if it is because of her political leanings and perhaps feelings of her ""corrupting me"" which is silly considering I grew into my beliefs before meeting her and we were just similarly minded and complimentary. My wife does feel it is hurtful I don't stand up to them in the moment more but is understanding that I have been working on being better with confrontation. I have often felt a bit afraid of most confrontation but definitely mostly with my family. Like I said earlier it has always been a thing that we tried our best to not hurt my mom's feelings on stuff as she can have a bit of a temper though I haven't lived there for almost 12 years so I have no idea how things have changed.

I'm thinking the only best path forward is that my wife just never has to see or speak to my parents again unless she wants to for some reason as at this point that is what she wants and obviously I cannot and won't make her do anything she doesn't want to do. I'll likely still go to holidays and things (other than Christmas as I won't leave my wife alone then which will be a fun conversation /s) but other than that our lives will be mostly separate. I don't think my family's dynamics can make space for my wife and at this point don't really think they like her much. I can only imagine they would be fine with us divorcing which I won't do though the question did come up and broke my heart to hear she feared I would want to divorce her over this. Her response is that she does wish she didn't have to yell to be heard but felt she had to and hates feeling like she is always causing problems but also feels like she has to stand up for herself with how she feels. She felt like I would want a divorce as that would let me make up with them, find someone they liked, and make my life less stressful which again broke my heart. I have assured her that none of that is true and even if we were to break up there is no guarantee that my life would be less stressful, but just that she wouldn't be in it which I do not want.

I have told my dad that I will talk to him at some point but I am not ready yet. I am just so done with these sorts of interactions and seeing my wife feel like she isn't worth the effort or isn't given the same care my other family members are given. So do we think I have the right of it? Am I missing something about my wife and my family is correct that she asks too much and is too critical of people which is always causing problems? Let me know if you have any questions for clarity and I will happily answer to the best of my ability. Thanks!",1,1744331692.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Maybe as an ice breaker you can tell me your name and how you like your coffee or tea? Hope to hear from you!",1,1744331409.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Hey guys, first-time poster here. To make a long story short: I got into an accident while drunk and got sentenced to 50 hours of AA and community service, along with a hefty fine and finished with a suspended license dangling off the side of this shit sundae. Not to mention my girlfriend of 5 years dumping me. I can't really blame her though, she was never a fan of me drinking and this was the last straw. 

‚Äî

So yeah, it's a Friday night. Prime time for bar hopping but here I am, sitting in an artificially lit room with bad coffee and slightly worse company. Not to say that they were bad people, but why would any of us be compatible? I know alcohol isn't all there is to life, and I agree with you. But this place is such a downer that I can't help but feel a little ill will. It's better than the county so I can't really complain that much. It's my first night though; maybe one or two of the folks will grow on me. 

‚ÄúI'd like to start off this meeting by addressing the new person in our group. Would you like to introduce yourself?‚Äù

He passed me this brightly colored stick with a feather tied to it with neon string.

‚ÄúUh, the name is Mike, and I got a court order to be here. I know I'm supposed to say I'm an alcoholic but honestly I just like drinking. I don't have a problem with it. I'm just here for my hours.‚Äù

I passed the stick back to the group leader.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ thank you for sharing, Mike. I just want to remind you that if you want those hours signed off you have to participate.‚Äù

I gave a nod. I already know I have to participate. The guy's an ass.

‚ÄúAlright, who wants to go first?‚Äù

As the group traded experiences and the talking stick amongst each other, I saw this woman walk in. She looked pretty from a distance. But when she got closer, you could tell that she's not keeping up with herself. She had dirty clothes and a faint smell. She sat next to me since that was the only free chair left. 

‚ÄúLet's take a moment to welcome the new face in the room. Brian, can you pass the talking stick to her?‚Äù

Brian passed the talking stick to the mystery woman but she slowly extended her arm, seeming hesitant about the mere act of speaking a word. She did take it after a moment. 

‚ÄúHi everyone, my name is Evelyn and I have a drinking problem.‚Äù 

Everyone murmured ‚ÄúHi Evelyn‚Äù and I parroted the crowd after a short delay. 

‚ÄúIt all started about two weeks ago. Before that, I wouldn't even consider having a drink if it wasn't the weekend. I don't know what changed in me, but I started having these intense migraines that for some reason only alcohol could soothe. It spiraled from there, and here I am horribly sober and unsure if this is the right choice. The doctor said I'm fine, and everything checks out but I don't know.‚Äù

The group leader chimed up after motioning for the talking stick.

‚ÄúThank you for sharing Evelyn, and no, you made the right decision. Life is hard but alcohol only makes life that much harder.

‚ÄúWhat a load of crap.‚Äù I thought. The only thing that makes a bad day good is a cold beer.

‚ÄúWe go by the twelve-step program here at AA Evelyn, are you familiar with it?‚Äù

She shook her head.

‚ÄúWell, the first step to being alcohol-free is to admit that we are powerless in our addiction. And the second step is to acknowledge there is a power that can restore us to sanity.‚Äù

Evelyn motioned for the talking stick which the group leader handed it happily.

‚ÄúGive yourself over to a higher power?‚Äù They passed the stick back and forth again. 

Talking stick? More like a passing stick. Jesus, this 50 hours of this is going to drive me insane. 

‚ÄúYes, it doesn't have to be a specific religion. Any belief will work.‚Äù

She closed her eyes in acknowledgment. He continued to say that they go by the buddy system. That means that everyone has one other person in this group that they can rely on so that they're not going through the twelve steps alone. And wouldn't you guess it, everyone already has a buddy. So it would only be natural that I became Evelyn's buddy. The meeting ended, and I got my first two hours signed off. I turned to the door, and when I got out I saw Evelyn smoking a cigarette. She looked kinda happy. 

‚ÄúYou got another one of those?‚Äù

She handed me her pack of cigarettes, and I pulled one out. I then pulled out a lighter and lit it, and handed her pack back to her.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

I grunted as I exhaled the smoke.

‚ÄúYou're welcome.‚Äù

We both stood there for a weird amount of time without talking. I broke the silence.

‚ÄúSo, uh want my number? Since we're buddies now it'll just be easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

She handed me her phone and I put in my number. 

‚ÄúIt was my first night too.‚Äù

I mumbled out. The cold air stung my lips as I breathed out to speak. 

‚ÄúIt was? Why are you here? By choice or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got court-ordered to. Two hours down forty-eight to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds rough. Don't worry, I'll make it easy for you.‚Äù

She smiled cutely. I blushed slightly at her reply. 

‚ÄúDon't worry about it, I can handle it.‚Äù

With that, I put out the cigarette with my boot, and I said goodbye. 

‚Äî

Now let's fast forward to the next week since nothing of real importance happened. She didn't call, or text besides one text about half a week in. She just said that the twelve-step program was helping her. I'm glad that this program actually does help people who want to quit get over their dependency on alcohol. I go into the next week with a renewed sense of vigor. Someone is counting on me to get them where they need to be. 

I walk in about five minutes early, the usual suspects are walking in, and some are getting what I'm assuming to be a cup of motor oil. I look around the room for Evelyn. And there I saw her, in the same seat she was in before. I walk up to sit down next to her.

‚ÄúHow ya doin‚Äô?‚Äù 

She turned around, and I saw a different woman ‚Äì not physically, but there was a light in her eyes that wasn't there before. 

‚ÄúYeah, I'm great! My migraines even went away!‚Äù

She said beaming ear to ear.

‚ÄúHey, that's great Evelyn! I'm happy to hear that.‚Äù

She told me that she was really excited about the next step, or something of that nature. I was really quite distracted by the way Evelyn was acting.

She said it in a frantic tone. I thought at the time that she was just extremely motivated for self-improvement, but now I'm not so sure.

The group sat down and the leader held out the talking stick. Its neon colors are an utter eyesore. 

‚ÄúWho wants to start first?‚Äù

Evelyn popped her hand up first with alarming speed which only I seemed to notice.

‚ÄúI would love to start.‚Äù

The group leader smiled and handed her the talking stick.

‚ÄúI'm so happy to see you doing much better, Evelyn.‚Äù

Evelyn grabbed the stick with both hands. Her knuckles turned white.

‚ÄúHi, Evelyn here! I've been sober for one week, and I have to be honest I've never felt better! I need to know what the third step is.‚Äù

She passed the stick to the group leader as quickly as her hands allowed. The group leader took it without regard to those twitchy movements. Was he trying to be polite? 

‚ÄúThe third step is to give yourself over to that God, utterly and completely.‚Äù

She closed her eyes and smiled hard. I thought this was insane. How is everyone just accepting this without even a grimace?

The rest of the group went on as normal. I barely got my hours in with how distracted I was from that whole exchange. When it finished I tried to just head to the bus stop. That's when Evelyn showed up from around the corner.

‚ÄúHey, buddy! Where ya goin‚Äô?‚Äù

I put on a facsimile of a smile even though I felt a growing unease with her presence. 

‚ÄúOh, I'm heading to the bus stop to go home.‚Äù

She asked to drive me home with that same grin, that light I once saw turned into a glint of madness with the way she was bending and moving like she was doing ballet moves while getting ready to play a round of football.

‚ÄúN-No I'm fine. Thanks though.""

I'm ashamed to admit it as a six-foot man who weighs 215 pounds, but this petite woman is scaring me. And there was no way I was letting that woman know where I live. 

‚ÄúAw, why not? I just wanna show my buddy how much I care about them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I'm fine. I like the walk home. It's nice out tonight.‚Äù 

The smile twitched for a moment as she held her eye contact.

‚ÄúWell if you insist!‚Äù

She snapped back to being animated again. 

‚ÄúGet home safe, buddy.‚Äù

This is where we're caught up with the story. The next meeting is in a couple of days, and Evelyn just messaged me that she embraced the third step. I'm not sure if being free is worth it.

Part 2


It's about three in the morning as I'm writing this, and I can't sleep. I had this weird dream about a bloody forest with silent human-shaped masses rising from the earth. And in the distance was a monochromatic mountain with something perched on top of it. I can't remember, though. When I woke up I could have sworn I saw someone looking in my window, but it was too dark for me to see. It couldn't have been Evelyn, right? I mean, I know I never gave her my address. Could it have been just a random voyeur? 

Well regardless, today's meeting went pretty smoothly actually. Mostly because Evelyn was a no-show this time around. Though the group leader told me I should check in with her, obviously I have reservations against that. But I have to be an active part of this program. So I pulled out my phone to send her a text even though it was now late at this time. But as I opened up the messages to start typing a hollow check in, my phone went off. Her name illuminates the screen. How did she know I was going to message her? Was it a coincidence? Was she watching me? 

I answered the phone and it was quiet on the other end. I mutter a hello, and she explodes immediately into the receiver.

‚ÄúHI! How are you buddy?!‚Äù she said with that same fanatical tone.

I tell her I'm fine, and to ask her how the twelve steps are treating her.

‚ÄúOh, it's been great! I never knew that God could be this wonderful!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù I said inquisitively 

‚ÄúYeah! I asked the group leader about the fourth step earlier this week and he said I needed to make a moral inventory of myself, and after some self-reflection I think that I accomplished it!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's awesome to hear Evelyn. I'm happy to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it is! But I need you, buddy. Can we meet up tomorrow?‚Äù

I told her I had community service tomorrow, but afterward I could. She let out an intense ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. I hung up the phone. I'm not feeling too great about this. At least we'll be somewhere public. I'm going to stop writing tonight. It's almost three thirty in the morning, and I have community service at ten. 

‚Äî

So, I just got home after talking to Evelyn. We met at a park downtown next to the church where we have our AA meetings. It was a relatively dry day for Washington, where I live currently. An early morning shower left the area dark with fresh rain. I found a dry bench underneath an old white oak tree that looks out to the main street.

‚ÄúHey, buddy!‚Äù

She seemed calmer. She opened her arms for a hug and I reciprocated. We sat down and I noticed some bandages wrapping around her arms, though I didn't bother to ask. 

‚ÄúHi Evelyn, how are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm doing great! Thank you for asking.‚Äù

I pulled out my pack of cigarettes and pulled one out. I offer her a cigarette but she turns me down.

‚ÄúOh, no thank you. I don't smoke anymore.‚Äù

I lit the cigarette and pulled on it for a moment before blowing a lungful of smoke out. 

‚ÄúWow, I wish I had that strength. Smoking is my one real vice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the only reason I was able to was through the power of God, as all things are made possible through them.‚Äù

On the surface that response would seem normal to someone in AA. But unless you were here with me, sitting in my spot with her looking you dead in the eyes with those intense green eyes, then you wouldn't really understand. 

‚ÄúSo what did you want to talk about, Evelyn?‚Äù

She took a deep breath and continued to calm down to a point of normalcy. 

‚ÄúI was told by the group leader that I had to admit all the wrongs I've ever done.‚Äù

I leaned back on the bench to listen to what she had to say. 

‚ÄúSo, a little about me; I'm a doctor for a local clinic. I'm mostly a family doctor.‚Äù

It's surprising hearing Evelyn tell me about her life. I've had such a fear-tinted perspective about her that I forgot that she was a regular person before the troubles began.

‚ÄúSounds like good work.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, at the time I thought it was.‚Äù

I looked at her with suspicion. 

She continued to say ‚ÄúBut ever since I've been on this journey with God, I realized what I was really doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? And what's that?

‚ÄúI wasn't loving them! I thought love was treating pain, but it's actually all about causing pain!‚Äù

‚ÄúCausing pain?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! When I used to express my love for my patients I really was doing them harm by hiding pain from them.‚Äù

My palms started to get sweaty as that same smile spread on her face.

‚ÄúBut pain is actually the greatest expression of love! Pain makes you value life, the ultimate gift given to you. Those who experience pain can recognize the true value of life!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that can't always be the case, what if someone suffering would rather die?‚Äù I asked nervously. 

Knowing how my grandma went out, I knew what she was saying wasn't always true. Sometimes living is just too much effort, and you would rather close shop early to see what's next.

‚ÄúThen, they are beyond redemption.‚Äù

The smile stayed on her face as she let those words crawl out from between her teeth. I wasn't sure what to say, what could I say to that?

‚ÄúBut you haven't, uh, expressed your love to anyone though, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo people yet.‚Äù 

Should I call the cops? It's a question I'm still asking myself as I type this out. Surely they would have to do something about it. No people yet? Has she been practicing on animals? Would the cops even believe me?

‚ÄúI gotta say, this is actually very fucked up.‚Äù I blurted out without thought, though I don't regret saying it. 

‚ÄúIt's okay buddy! I'm not gonna love anyone yet! I still have to learn how. After I learn then you'll see the beauty of true, divine love.‚Äù

She played with her bandages on her arms as she talked.

‚ÄúGod is trying to teach me how to love, and soon I'll know how so I can spread this message to everyone.‚Äù

I made some excuse to leave and as I was walking away I heard her say something behind me. I turned around to see and she was right behind me. So close, in fact, that I could feel her hot breath. I jump backward, and she doesn't advance. 

‚ÄúMaybe I can come over and teach you how to love once I learn.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, I'm not sure, I live with roommates.‚Äù

I lied through my teeth, but who would blame me?

She dawned a look of shock. Her eyes were filled with this violent flame. It honestly shook me to my core. 

‚ÄúWhy would you lie to me? I've seen you at home silly. You should really keep your curtains closed. Anyone can just take a peek.‚Äù

My blood ran cold and then I knew, she was the one who was watching me. 

I stammered out a half-assed ‚ÄúI gotta go.‚Äù 

I'm trying not to show my fear, but it was so hard to mask it from her.

I began to walk away, constantly looking behind me to see her standing in place holding that still pose. On her toes, with her arms behind her back, and her neck craned at a slightly right angle. That demented smile, barely covered by her red hair. I kept looking back every other second until she vanished completely. Almost as if she was never there in the first place. I need to take a break. I'll write an update when something happens. This is stressing me out. Screw the AA guidelines. I need a beer.

Postscript; I wonder why our group leader is guiding her and not noticing her rapid descent. Is he involved in this somehow? I should ask him for any insight into this situation.


Part 3


So it's been a couple days since I talked to the group leader. His name is Mark, by the way. I finally got around to ask him what his name was. 

Mark told me that he doesn't understand what I'm talking about regarding Evelyn. I found that to be utter bullshit. 

‚ÄúShe is just embracing the program. If you actually took AA seriously, then maybe you would be a little more familiar with god.‚Äù

First off, I'm no stranger to God. I grew up Roman Catholic, and am in no way a non-believer. I might not be the best example in this religion, but I still believe. And nothing about Evelyn is screaming godly. He really didn‚Äôt give me anything, though. He seemed to be holding something back. I wish I could have grilled him harder for anything but the residual crowd from the AA meeting was stopping me from diving in deeper. 

‚ÄúJust be there for her and I'm sure your opinion will shift. She's making full use of this program. It's something to aspire to.‚Äù

Him saying that had me wondering: what is the purpose of AA? No not the skin-deep alcoholics program but what Is lying under the surface. Why would you need God to quit drinking? There are plenty of therapeutic methods to get over alcoholism that don't involve God. I don't really have any proof for my speculations but regardless, it's something that has been itching at me for a while. Hell, I've questioned why this program even existed in the past. Though, at the time, it wasn't worth much more thought than a simple ‚Äúdifferent strokes, for different folks.‚Äù 

Well regardless, Evelyn wasn't at the last meeting either. I'm almost too afraid to broach the matter. She knows where I live, and at any point, she can show up with whatever horrors she's been making in her spare time. Until then, I'll leave this here as it is for now. At this point, this is less of me looking for help by posting this and more to document this spiral of insanity. 

‚Äî

Update; I woke up this morning to a splayed animal on my porch. It looks like it was a fox. This was Evelyn, I know it was. I was expecting this sooner or later. But what really haunted me, and continues to still haunt me, is that she left a letter written in red ink inside the cavity of the fox where its heart once was. 

The letter simply says ‚ÄúI'm doing God's work, and soon you'll know the product of that work! Until then, buddy! I'll be seeing you.‚Äù

I shuddered more at the note than the damn fox. Is she watching me now? There's no way. Since that encounter at the park, I've been good at keeping my curtains closed. 

Another update; this red ink she used for the note‚Ä¶ I'm pretty sure it's blood. Was it from the fox? I'm hoping it's the fox's but at this point, I'm not too sure.

‚Äî

It's about seven in the morning as I'm writing this. Last night was truly horrible. You should have seen Evelyn. My porch is covered with dark blood and small bits of gore. I still haven't mustered up the courage to clean it up. Let me explain myself. I woke up around two in the morning. And Evelyn was knocking on my door. She was saying something, but she was talking in a slurred way almost as if she was drunk. The knocks wouldn't stop. Soft, but steady thumps echoed through my dark house. I got up after a moment of steeling myself for what I would expect to be another traumatizing experience. 

I went and answered the door to see Evelyn. A horrid mess of what you would once call a human being. She mutilated herself to the point of absurdity. How was she still walking? Knocking? I barely can recall her, it was too horrible to remember completely. All I remember is her stomach being hollow. It was a windy night and the wind rang through her abdomen. Her eyes were black pits, yet I knew she could see me. A triangle with an arrow on each side with a sideways eye in the center was carved into her forehead. And her mouth, or what you would call a mouth. Her cheeks were cut away, exposing her teeth completely, and in a way she was still smiling.There was more, I know there was, but I can't remember it. And to be honest, I don't really want to remember.

I closed the door almost immediately after seeing her as she was. She spoke to me through the door. The words gargled out of her half-face.

‚ÄúHey there, buddy. Can I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you can't come in!‚Äù I stammered out. 

I'm freaking out. Is this her love? Was she going to turn me into something from Clive Barker's darkest dream? 

‚ÄúOh come on buddy, I just want to share my progress through the twelve steps‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can tell me through the door.‚Äù

There was silence for a bit. Well, almost silence. There was a constant light drizzling sound as she stood there. It wasn't raining.

‚ÄúIf you insist. I've moved through steps six and seven. I'm so close to becoming what God wants me to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this? Why don't you talk to Mark about this!‚Äù

I shouted through the door with my head pressed against it. My rage broke through my fear. I shouldn't be afraid in my own home.

Her eye sockets looked through the peephole as she spoke with a disgustingly sweet voice.

‚ÄúBecause he's a believer in God, buddy. But you need convincing, and so that's why I'm taking you with me down this road.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I do believe in God, I'm a Catholic.‚Äù

She giggled and I knew if she could she would be sporting that comparatively tame smile.

‚ÄúNot that God, silly. That God was nothing but false hope. He turned his back on his followers a long time ago. His love was fleeting, but my love is eternal.‚Äù

Her voice deepened near the end almost as if she was being puppeteered by some unseen hand. 

‚ÄúHe was a frail and weak thing. He created you to love him entirely. I don't demand your love, but instead I shower you with mine.‚Äù 

I still don't know how to deal with that. Is what she's saying true? Has God abandoned us? Leaving us to the whims of whatever she's been possessed by?

Her voice went from deep to her normal tone as smoothly as it came on.

‚ÄúI have to go then, buddy. Since you're not ready to be loved then I'll just move on to step eight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat's step eight?‚Äù

She turns her back to my door, and at this point, I'm barely mustering up the courage to look.

‚ÄúWhat's step eight!?‚Äù

‚ÄúMake a list of all I wronged‚Äù

That's right I remembered the steps: the next would be to make amends, but there was a catch twenty-two to step nine.

‚ÄúYeah, but after that you have to make amends with them, in a way that won't injure them!‚Äù

She continues to walk down the steps. That drizzle is still present, along with small wet thuds. 

‚ÄúYou're silly, I'm not going to injure them. I would be loving them.‚Äù 

I finally opened the door again to yell some half-hearted rebuttal, probably about how she shouldn't be choosing other people's fates. But she was gone. That trail of blood stopped abruptly. I looked at my door from the outside and I noticed that the symbol on her forehead was carved into my door. I didn't see her with any weapons. Though, if I'm remembering right; her hands did glint in a strange way in the moonlight. And they seemed to be sharpened. I gotta go. That mess isn't going to get cleaned. And the more I wait, the harder it will be. At least it's Halloween.

Edit; I just saw a report on the news. A brutal massacre took place at a local clinic. They won't give many details but none survived. 

Edit number two; leaked photos from the massacre made their way online. There was a message written in blood on a wall in the waiting room: ‚ÄúLove is pain.‚Äù I'm going to be sick, I'm not sure how much longer I can take this.

Part 4

Before I tell you about earlier tonight, I have to share something. I've never been one to get scared the way I have been portraying myself. I've never had a bully growing up. What I'm trying to say is I'm not weak physically or mentally. But today was so horribly fucked up that I'm not sure if I'll ever be the same person. I guess intense and existential fear can do that to someone. So where do I begin? I guess you can say my morning was quiet, but I was so stressed out that I stood on my toes those silent hours just waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

Once it hit six at night I went to AA. By seven-thirty I rolled in. I was technically early but I hadn't seen anyone lingering around the parking lot like usual. My animal instincts were telling me something wasn't right. But at the same time, I had my logic telling me that there's no way she would actually come here right? However, that was more naive hope rather than logic fueling my brain. I just wanted to get AA over with. 

Regardless, I walked in. I saw the usuals, I said my round of hey‚Äôs and how are ya‚Äôs, but I wasn't getting the response I was hoping for. Everyone had their backs to me and was talking among themselves, some of them were laughing. I wish I had the energy to laugh at something. Mark was sitting in his usual spot, he had sunglasses on. 

‚ÄúIsn't it a bit late for sunglasses?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah it is, but I had an accident, and it's just easier if I wear them for now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, no judgment. I hope you get better.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I will be. Thanks, Mike.‚Äù

Even though that's totally in character for him to say that I still felt slightly sick. It was the inflection in his voice, something about it seemed extremely familiar. It felt like Evelyn. I ignored that, though, because it could have just been me. I'm legitimately traumatized from this walking nightmare circus of horror and despair. 

‚ÄúAlright everyone, it's time to come together. Group is about to start.‚Äù

I took a deep breath and calmed myself. There was always the possibility of her coming, but besides me, I don't feel like she loves everyone else in this room more than her patients. But based on the news, she's been committing a string of horrible, family-wide murder sprees. Though unofficial reports from first responders talked about the survivors; they were all hysterical in their pain. They kept exclaiming their love for God. The doctors and paramedics are baffled to see them so alive for how much blood and flesh were missing. The cops sharing their stories on the community blog said that when they came to another one of the crime scenes, they felt this presence in the air. And in the heart of it would be a single survivor, usually a child. But they are so horribly mangled that the cops swore off meat until the day they die. One cop kept talking about reporting to a house in his neighborhood. He knew the family personally and often helped their kid with his soccer. When people were asking for a description of the child all the cop could say was 

‚ÄúOpen ribcage.‚Äù

As the group came together, I noticed they were all wearing some kind of headgear and some had their hair in their eyes. I felt anxious, and in the back of my head I told myself, ‚ÄúThe door is right behind you. You can just say goodbye to all of this and go to another city once a week for AA.‚Äù 

I wish I just listened to myself, although now that I think about it, it wouldn't have mattered anyway.

‚ÄúBefore we start, though, I feel like it's appropriate if we pray to God.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never prayed before a meeting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're right, but now is the dawn of something new. Something truly pure.‚Äù

He took off his glasses, and his eyes were not only stripped out but all the bones with it. You could see into his carved-out brain cavity. He breaks the glasses and jabs each one of the arms of the glasses into his neck, over and over, letting a fountain of blood pour. I tried to get up, but someone was holding me down. It was Todd, another one of the usuals, but he unzipped his sweater to show his once big belly was now a disgusting bloom of fat and flesh. He removed his mask to show the same modification as Evelyn's. But his seemed a lot more‚Ä¶rough? It looked like he tore it off rather than cutting it. 

‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? What's wrong with you people?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUs? You think something is wrong with us?‚Äù said Mark through gargles of blood. 

His skin was becoming more and more pale, but his energy only seemed to rise as he got up. He tore off his buttoned shirt to show off what he called the mark of devotion and love. His heart was intact, and so were his lungs. But the whole front of him was missing, besides the ribs which were being used as racks for his intestines to be squeezed through and stretched to a point where I'm sure if you hit it the right way ghastly music would be made. 

‚ÄúYou don't think this was some flight of fancy of a sick woman, did you? This was all designed to come to fruition.‚Äù

More people started showing their own love-wracked bodies. I closed my eyes to spare myself while I tried to get more information out of him, if not for anyone else, then for me.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean designed? Why did it take you so long? Weren't you founded in the thirties?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe waited for so long hoping that the Messiah would come to us, for we cannot find the Messiah ourselves, they have to give consent to become the true mortal embodiment of our God. And finally, we have one. For so long, people were too focused on the Abrahamic God and closed off their hearts to anything other than the vacant God of false hope. But now with the new age, more people are opening their minds to new possibilities, and finally we were able to find Evelyn.‚Äù

‚ÄúConsent? That's bullshit! The only reason why she started AA was because of her horrible migraines that could only be cured by alcohol.‚Äù

Mark sighed, his lacerated trachea whistled softly. 

‚ÄúThose migraines were a Mark of affection, Mike. Our God chose her, but-‚Äù

He emphasized the but as if this word would shut down my previous statement.

‚ÄúShe decided to let him in. It's a part of the twelve steps. All of this was designed to indoctrinate her and raise her up. If she truly did not want this fate, then our God would have passed over her before too long.‚Äù

I couldn't say anything, he was right. I was there the whole time bearing witness. She did want it, or was it all because of this horrible dark God? I can't tell anymore. It's all kind of blurring together, and I'm not really sure what's real. I'm not even sure I will ever figure out what is real again.

‚ÄúNow, if you don't have any more questions, let me bring in our lord in the flesh to pray over this blessed reunion.‚Äù

Evelyn drifted down from above. Her back skin was flayed, and it looked to be like she stitched someone else's skin to her own to create a cape. She wore a crown of children's skulls still covered with fresh blood and strips of gore.

Everyone around me bows and my captor does the same, and I shoot upwards from my seat.

‚ÄúWhere are you going buddy? I wanted to share with you that I am almost done with my journey, I prayed for God to guide me through and I have reached enlightenment. The God of flesh and bone has been made anew, The holy covenant was made real. And now I walk where God walks.‚Äù

I tried to stay lucid, though the aura radiating from her forced my mind to waver. I kept getting flashes of the monochromatic mountain. The great beast that sat atop the peak. With the skull of some forgotten behemoth of old and a shroud of darkness enveloping its figure. From below that monstrosity, rivers of blood seeped down the mountain and filled the basins near the base. From that rancid pool of blood rose creatures of mythic nightmares. I snapped back to reality and was almost completely embraced by Evelyn. I felt her running her sharpened fingertip down my shoulder, cutting it deeply. I pulled back from it. 

‚ÄúStill not ready to be loved?‚Äù

I screamed a bestial scream as I ran out. I kept running and running. I ran for what felt like days. I ran until the blood loss made me nearly faint. 

I decided I'd rather spend one hundred days in the county jail. At least then Evelyn won't find me so easily. I'm transcribing this for a buddy of mine to post this last part, a person I feel really bad about dragging into this, but at the same time he might be pulled in anyway. As I write these final sentences, I can still feel her in the back of my mind.

Postscript; I just caught a glimpse of the guard‚Äôs TV. The news is on, and it looks like a growing riot in our town. They preach that pain is love and more people are joining it every day. Each one mutilating themselves to horrific proportions. God help us all.

I used to drink coffee occasionally, but it's starting to become a daily thing, but I don't know how to make it taste good. I like Dunkin's iced caramel latte / iced coffee + caramel with skim milk (basic i know) but I can't seem to recreate it at home. I don't know if it's my terrible coffee-making skills, the coffee maker, the coffee grinds I'm using, etc.

For reference, I use Dunkin's original blend, and I have the Ninja DualBrew Pro Specialty Coffee System. I tried using the measurements I found online to make it taste the same as Dunkin's but the espresso tastes bitter I guess? It also just doesn't taste very strong. I was watching the espresso brew and the first half comes out basically just water, and then a bit of espresso, and when it was finishing up, it looked like more water coming out?

I thought of buying a nespresso coffee + espresso maker, but maybe I don't need to if I can fix whatever the problem is I have over here.

I would also love to branch out and try new flavors/syrups (and not be so basic), but I figure if I can't make a basic caramel coffee, why try to make something that may be more complicated?

Any help/tips would be greatly appreciated! <3",1,1744331214.0,brew,0,1.0,False

We have two separate critical care units with about 120 nurses between them. For nurses week, my hospital usually does a magnet award ceremony, a tricky tray, and a wellness day for the entire hospital but for our unit, we wanted to do something special for the nurses and bring nurses week to them.

I sat down with the managers and assistant managers to plan for nurses week and we came up with some stuff we thought would be nice for the staff.
Some of the activities we have planned include a big breakfast (to accommodate about 70 people), a coffee bar, our own tricky tray with some gift sets, a nurse blanket, some items we purchased from Code Blue Memes, tumblers, T-shirts, and gift cards. We also bought nursing pins for every nurse on the unit.  We also bought t-shirts for everyone.
We will be doing a wellness day where we hired a massage therapist to come in and one of the managers does reiki and we planned on having aroma therapy and such. We are also doing our own awards for the units and everyone will be making nurses hats for one of their colleagues. 
We planned to finish out the week with a pot luck and we booked an escape room for that evening and put a sign up sheet so we have an accurate headcount so we know how much space we need.

My daughter is also making bracelets for all of the nurses with charms I purchased.

Between myself, the two assistant nurse managers, and the two nurse managers- we are each spending hundreds of dollars of our own money to try and make it special and make the nurses feel appreciated.

With that being said- a couple of the nurses today started complaining during our morning huddle today when we talked about the escape room saying they were never consulted about what they wanted to do and would have preferred bowling or golfing at Top Golf. They were snarky and frankly, kind of shitty about it. 

I could see how hurt the manager was and, to be honest, I‚Äôm really hurt too. We genuinely were trying to make it a special week for everyone and that‚Äôs not easy to do with over 120 nurses.  We wanted to show them how much we appreciate the hard work they do. I don‚Äôt want to say they were ungrateful as we weren‚Äôt doing these things with any expectations of them or anything‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs just hurtful when we are really trying to do something nice. The hospital doesn‚Äôt give us any stipend for nurses week or any celebrations and many units don‚Äôt really do anything extra. 
I figure maybe next year we can ask for volunteers for a ‚Äúnurses week committee‚Äù to let them plan their own events but I‚Äôm sure they will complain about that too.

Help Me Retire Early and Become a Millionaire (Yes, Seriously)


Hi, I'm Cameron‚Äîa 9-to-5 warrior, microwave meal connoisseur, and dreamer with a wild but oddly reasonable goal: to retire early and become a millionaire.


Now, before you roll your eyes and scroll past thinking ""Who does this person think they are?""‚Äîhear me out.


I've spent 21 years grinding in the workforce, working hard, paying taxes, contributing to society, and daydreaming about sipping coffee at 10am on a Tuesday while the rest of the world is stuck in traffic. I‚Äôve realized that the traditional retirement age isn‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôm chasing freedom, not just dollars.


So I decided to do something bold: Ask the internet to help me flip the script.


What Will I Do With the Money?


Invest in smart, ethical, long-term assets (stocks, real estate, maybe a taco truck?)


Build passive income streams so I‚Äôm not asking for handouts forever.


Start a YouTube channel and help others dream bigger too.


Volunteer my time and energy once I‚Äôm financially free, because let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîlife‚Äôs more meaningful when you give back.


What‚Äôs In It For You? Besides the bragging rights of saying ‚ÄúI helped that person retire early!‚Äù, anyone who donates will be part of my ""Millionaire Club"" email list where I‚Äôll share funny updates, transparent progress reports, and maybe a few surprise giveaways as I build this dream.


This isn‚Äôt just about money‚Äîit‚Äôs about proving that the world still has a sense of humor, and sometimes, chasing something outrageous just might work.


Donate if you believe in dreams. Or if you‚Äôre just curious to see if someone can actually pull this off.


Let‚Äôs make history‚Äîone dollar at a time.

Italy.
Spain.
France.
England.
Australia.
There are so many amazing options but I can only pick one yet whichever one I pick is one which could strongly impact the rest of my life or at least the next few years of my life because this isn't just a vacation, it's more of a temporary staycation.
""Can I help you, ma'am?""
An effeminate voice with a southern twang asks me.
I narrow my eyes from the board on the wall to the young man behind the desk who was looking at me with a big, bright smile on his glossy lips.
""Actually, you can...do you fancy playing Russian roulette with me?""
I ask him with a smile and he looks at me like I've lost my qmind.
""Ma'am...this is an airport, it's not a casino""
He says and I chuckle.
""I know that, sir, I'm just looking to get away from New York for a little while but I'm stuck on where to go""
I say and he rolls his eyes in a jokey and semi-serious kind of way.
""Let me guess, you're running away from a boy?""
""Got it in one""
I say while nodding my head and smiling.
Dylan Tate is definitely a little boy.
Grown men who are mature don't do what he did.
""You really shouldn't let a man run you out of your own home, honey because the moment you give a man that type of power and control, it's hard to get it back""
""Well, it's kind of hard to stay here when my fiance screwed my brother behind my back""
I say angrily while smiling a sad and pained smile as the guy behind the desk gasps dramatically and clutches at his invisible pearls.
""Oh my""
He says as he straightens his jacket and looks at me with a shocked and sympathetic expression.
""Well, if I can make a suggestion...London is always beautiful at this time of year""
London.
I think to myself as I smile a real and genuine smile.
This is the first time in four whole weeks that I've smiled like this.
I've always wanted to visit London, England but for some reason, it just never happened.
""The UK has also got a lot of historical and cultural spots if you're interested in that type of stuff, not to mention their nightlife is lit""
He says the last bit while doing a little twerk before quickly getting himself together and looking around to see if anyone had seen him do it.
""Sorry ma'am, that wasn't professional at all""
""Don't worry about it""
I said while chuckling.
""It looks like I'm going to London then, when does the next flight leave?""
""In twenty minutes, ma'am""
""Great, book me a seat please, oh and make sure it's one way""
I say and the guy looks up at me with sympathetic eyes.
He then arranges my ticket for me and books me on the next flight to London.
I was so excited but I was also feeling really nervous as well, especially when I was handed my ticket and I was told what gate I had to go to.
The reason why I felt this way is because this meant it was real, I was really leaving not just New York but also America, my home and right now with how I'm feeling, it's going to be for good.
I thank the worker who wishes me good luck as I head towards my gate and take a seat letting out a sigh as I did.
The past four weeks have been super freaking crazy and stressful for me and I just can't wait to get away for a little while so that I can get over recent events, get myself together and work on myself mentally.
I take a sip of my water as my mind drifts back to four weeks ago when all of this mess started.
My fiance Dylan Tate and I were hosting our engagement party at the Ritz Carlton and it was supposed to be the party of the century.
The Carpenter, Black and Tate families are the top three most powerful, influential and richest families in New York's elite and the fact that two of these families were joining together through marriage was a big freaking deal but I didn't care about any of that.
I loved Dylan and I had loved him ever since I first set my eyes on him when I was sixteen, we were childhood sweethearts and had dated each other ever since our high school days.
He's the love of my life, the man of my dreams, so when he proposed to me in Bali, the answer was a given and I couldn't have been any happier but then my whole world came crashing down the night of my engagement party, the night that was supposed to be one of the best nights of my life turned into pure hell.
What happened was, Dylan had gone AWOL right before we were supposed to make the official announcement, so I went looking for him but I wasn't expecting to see what I saw when I finally found him.
I found Dylan in our hotel room with my brother Luca and both had nothing on.
I can't even begin to describe to you how painful it was to see the love of my life and my beloved older brother who I love so freaking much entangled the way that they were.
I was so heartbroken and devastated that I didn't even stay to hear their sorry excuses.
I quickly left the room and the hotel altogether because honestly, there's nothing they could say or even do that would be good enough for me to accept or even forgive.
After I left the hotel, I went to a nearby bar where I drank all of my pain and sorrows away.
I ended up getting so freaking drunk that I found myself in a hotel room losing my innocence to some strange guy or at least that's what I thought at the time.
When I woke up the next morning, I realised the guy who I had been intimate with and gave my precious flower to was none other than New York's most eligible bachelor Logan Black who is also the best friend of my eldest brother Justin.
I was in so much shock and I couldn't believe I had been with Logan.
I instantly freaked out and panicked because I didn't know how Logan was going to react when he woke up and realised he'd had been with me, the girl he had always seen as his younger sister and I really didn't wanna to stay to find out, so I quickly got dressed and left the hotel room.
I then went home where of course, I found out I was the villain of my story because I had left my engagement party without a word and had shown up the next morning literally doing the walk of shame.
My parents questioned me about where I had been? who I had been with? why did I leave? how could I embarrass the Carpenter and Tate familys the way that I did? you know all that blah, blah, blah BS.
Of course, Luca and Dylan didn't say anything and they were only too happy to throw me to the wolves which broke my heart even further because they were supposed to love me, yet they didn't care and they stood there allowing me to take the brunt of the blame for last night when it was all their fault.
Anyway, I took all of the abuse and all hell broke loose when I told them that the wedding was off and I didn't want to marry Dylan anymore which angered my parents, more specifically my dad who hit me for the first time in my life and he demanded or I should say he commanded me to still go through with the wedding.
Even that fake piece of trash Dylan acted like a love-sick victim and begged me not to cancel the wedding and even had the nerve to say he'd forgive me, you know ME for MY indiscretions, the cheeky man but I refused to budge even despite my dad's determination for it to still go ahead.
I didn't wanna fight them anymore, so I let them all think they had won, so while everyone was planning the wedding of the century, I was making plans of my own to leave and get away.
I really didn't want to leave because at the end of the day, my family are still my family and I love them so much but I knew I could never forgive them, especially Luca.
Luca was my best friend growing up and I was the closest to him out of all of my brothers which is why this is so devastating to me.
It's also the reason why I stopped myself from publically dragging Luca and Dylan out of the closet and outing them to the world so that everyone would know I wasn't the big, bad wolf in this story because deep down inside of me, I still do love them both and I don't want to hurt either of them.
There's also another reason why I'm leaving or I should say this was the final nail in the coffin if you will and that reason is because I'm pregnant with Logan's baby.
I knew my parents would flip their lids when they found out and they'd either assume Dylan is the father and would use my baby to make the wedding happen sooner or they'd wanna know who the real father is and if they learned Logan is the father then they'd force me to marry him to save face.
I didn't want either of those options, I didn't want Dylan and I didn't want Logan, I just wanted me and my baby, so I packed a bag and grabbed as much cash as I could because I didn't wanna take any cards with me in case they tried to track me down and I headed straight for JFK airport hoping to start a new life.
I was brought out of my thoughts when I heard the boarding call for my flight.
I let out a breath and smiled as I thought to myself this is it whilst placing a hand on my stomach.
""It's just you and me from now on my little angel""
I take a final deep breath in and slowly release it before standing up and grabbing my bags.
I then head towards my gate and my new life in London, England.
Six Years Later...
""KIDS!!, BREAKFAST IS READY!!""
""OK, MUM!!""
I plate up mine and the kid's breakfasts and place them on the table along with four cups of orange juice and a cup of coffee for myself.
I was grabbing a few condiments for the table when my three babies came barrelling into the room with my youngest son Dayton looking like he was going to a Marvel or DC convention.
""Dayton baby, I thought I told you all to get ready for school?""
""You did and I did""
He said cheekily and I rolled my eyes.
""Son, you can't wear your Batman mask and cape to school""
""Why not? I look cool""
He says and I chuckle.
""Yes I know you do, son but you can't just wear it""
""Why not?""
""Because it's the rules, Dayton, we have to wear our school uniforms and nothing else""
My one and only baby girl says before taking a sip of her drink.
""But Elijah gets to wear his Spiderman costume every day, mum""
""That's because Elijah is autistic, baby and the school are trying to make his school life a little bit easier and make it as comfortable as possible for him""
I tell him for the umpteenth time and he drops his head in defeat.
""Ok, fine...can I wear it after school?""
He asks and I smile.
""Of course, you can""
I bend down and give him a kiss.
""Now come and eat your breakfast before it gets all cold and soggy""
""Ok, mum""
Dayton and I take our seats and my eldest baby, my firstborn Logan couldn't resist making a comment about his brother's attire.
""You look like a nerd, Dayton""
""Says the one who is reading a chemistry book at the breakfast table""
""It's biology actually and it doesn't hurt to want to warm your brain up before school""
""That makes no sense at all""
Dayton says while rolling his eyes.
""Actually it does, Dayton, it's just like when you go to the gym, you warm up first, right? Logan reading a book before school is like a warm-up for him to go and learn""
Why did that make so much sense?.
I mean, don't get me wrong, my babies are smart, actually, they're super smart, so it shouldn't be surprising or shocking to me that they'd say something clever but it is every single time.
""Ok guys, knock it off and eat, please""
We all eat our food and I couldn't keep my eyes off my three bundles of joy as we ate.
It was one of the biggest shocks of my life when I found out I was expecting triplets and I near fainted in the doctor's office, especially when my mind started going into overdrive about things like giving birth but thankfully the pregnancy and the birth went better than I expected because I had my best friend Carmella there with me and she's been there for me ever since.
My kids are my entire life and have been ever since I left New York six years ago.
I've got two handsome boys and a beautiful little girl who have all just turned five years old and they're the lights of my life.
My eldest son is Logan David Junior, yes I named him after his biological father and his paternal grandfather David Black which is something that I never planned on doing at first but as soon as I gave birth to him and I held him for the very first time, I knew that I couldn't give him any other name.
Logan is my quiet child and he's very introverted compared to his siblings, he also loves to learn new things and is always either studying, reading a book, watching educational programmes or looking up something educational on the internet.
He's not as sociable as his brother and sister but he still likes to have fun and hang out with other kids his age just as long as he knows and trusts them.
My baby is also obsessed with science and computers and is constantly learning the ins and outs of them both, hence why he's currently reading a biology book while he's eating his eggs.
All three of my kids are very skilled musically and Logan is one hell of a pianist.
He's won so many awards for it and he even performed at the Royal Albert Hall for the Royal Variety performance in front of the royal family last year which made me one hell of a proud momma wolf.
Then there's my youngest son Dayton James who is named after my father.
Dayton is my little troublemaker, he's my cheeky child who has got one hell of a smartass mouth and he loves to joke around and play pranks on people which I hate and I'm trying to knock it out of him but it's hard, especially when he religiously watches Home Alone because he says the main character Kevin is his idol.
I really should've given Dayton the middle name Liam after my big brother because he's just like his uncle in every way possible, even his laugh is the same as Liam's.
Despite being a Johnny Knoxville in training, Dayton is a mathematician which is something he must've gotten from his dad because I'm dumb as a chicken when it comes to numbers, he also loves the drums which fits perfectly with his personality and lately, he's been taking air guitar lessons with a tutor.
Then there's my little princess, my daughter Teddy Louise who I named after my mom.
Teddy is a little girly girl who is obsessed with Disney, she loves to get dressed up and look pretty but she's also not afraid to get her hands dirty.
She loves it when it rains because she gets to stomp around in puddles but her favourite weather is when it snows because she loves to build snowmen and make snow angels.
Teddy also loves to bake and can make pretty much anything but her favourite thing to bake is cupcakes because she loves to decorate them with different icing and sprinkles.
She's obsessed with many forms of art and loves to learn about the history of different famous artists, especially the likes of Picasso and Van Gogh, they really intrigue her for some reason.
Teddy also loves to play the flute and can play many different beautiful melodies on it but she's not as into it as her older brothers are with their instruments.
All three of my kids are incredibly smart and they attend a special school for the gifted after they were referred there by their previous school when they all started showing signs of being child prodigies.
I always knew my kids were special and were more intelligent than most other kids their ages but I never in my wildest dreams would have ever thought that one let alone all three of my babies would be child prodigies because I always believed they were rare like one in a million type of rare, yet I managed to birth three, that's crazy.
""Mum""
Dayton's cute, adorable voice broke me from my thoughts.
""Yes, baby""
""Can I have some more juice, please?""
""Of course you can, do you two want some more as well?""
I ask Logan and Teddy who nod their hands.
I grab the jug of juice and fill up their glasses before sitting back down in my chair.
""Thanks, mum""
My babies said in unison while smiling and I smiled back at them.
""You're welcome, babies""
I said as I heard a noise coming from the front door which I knew was the mail.
I once again get up from my chair and go to see what junk I've been sent today.
I wasn't expecting anything important because all of my bills have been paid for and are up to date, so I wasn't expecting anything more than just junk mail and takeaway leaflets which they seriously need to stop giving us, the internet is a thing, folks.
I let out a breath as I look through the pile but my eyes narrowed and I was confused/scared when one of the letters caught my attention for several reasons.
The first reason is because of the American stamps and the address which are in the corners of the envelope.
The latter is something the majority of the UK don't do, so that struck me as odd and the second reason is the very familiar handwriting on it which I immediately recognised as my grandfather Joseph's handwriting.
My heart was beating a mile a minute and my anxiety had spiked as I continued to look at the envelope and they got worse as my fingers danced over the Christmas stamp which had been used to seal the letter.
I didn't know what was in the letter but it was enough to make me feel panicked and nervous because nobody from my previous life except for Carmella knows where I live now, so how in on earth has my grandpa found out where I am? and why is he writing to me? what does he want?.
""Mum, we need to go, we're going to be late""
Teddy says and I look up to see all three of my kids standing in the hallway putting on their coats, hats, scarves and gloves.
It's December and the weather is cold which is something I'm used to as a native of New York but in the UK, the mornings always seem really bitter, so I make sure we're all wrapped up warm whenever we leave the house.
I place the pile of letters on the side cabinet and go to put on my coat and accessories before grabbing my bag and making sure I've got everything I need including my phone, purse, house keys and car keys.
""Are you ready to go, babies?""
""Yep""
""Mmm-hmm""
""Yes, mum""
The kids all say at the same time.
""Have you got your book bags and packed lunches?""
I ask them and they all nod their heads.
""Ok, let's go""
We leave our home and head towards the car.
I make sure all of the kids are safely strapped in before getting in myself, we then set off for their school as we sing along to the Christmas songs which were playing on the radio.
Christmas has always been my favourite time of the year and it's also my kids favourite as well.
This time of year is also always really bittersweet for me because Christmas with my family used to be amazing and we'd always have so much fun.
It was the one time of the year when we'd all gather together and stay at my parent's mansion for the entire holiday and we'd celebrate it in style.
I really wish I could go back to those times.
There's nothing I'd love more than for my babies to have a REAL family Christmas with our family maybe even with their father and his family but I highly doubt this will happen anytime soon.
It's crazy how fast our lives can change within the blink of an eye and sometimes you don't even know it's happening until it's already happened.
The past six years have been a crazy whirlwind and I've had to get used to a lot of changes in my life since I moved to London but now I'm happily settled and living my best life, well, I'm living as great of a life as I possibly can without my beloved family here with me.
There was a time when my family and I were extremely close, we would always see and talk with each other every day and we always did anything and everything for one another but all of that changed and I saw a totally different side to my family after Dylan and Luca's betrayal.
I always used to think I had the perfect family, the perfect parents, the perfect grandparents and the perfect older brothers and in a way, I still feel that way about them but I also can't forget the immediate change in them when I found out my older brother was screwing my fiance.
The betrayal left me a heartbroken mess and it changed my entire life forever, it also changed all of the plans I had made for my future.
Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a school teacher, I wanted to teach the future generation and prepare them for the next stages of their lives.
A few months before everything happened six years ago, I was offered a place at one of the best colleges in New York to get my teaching degree but then my relationship broke down and the perfect future I had planned with Dylan had gone up in flames along with everything else.
I no longer had any desire to get my teaching degree but I needed to find a steady income so that I could provide for myself and the triplets because I knew my savings which was a very substantial amount of money wouldn't last me forever.
I wasn't used to living like this because I was born a millionaire heiress, I had always lived a life of luxury and I never had to worry about anything, so to now live knowing money was running out was kind of scary, especially since I now had three extra mouths to feed and I didn't want my kids to grow up differently to how I did.
Don't get me wrong I wasn't a spoiled little rich girl or anything like that but I lived a comfortable life with no worries and I wanted the same for my kids as well.
I didn't want them to grow up worrying about things that they shouldn't have to which I know they would've done because they're really smart and they would've immediately sensed when something was wrong.
Anyway, I knew I needed to make some decent money and fast but I didn't know how.
That was until one day when I was watching some soppy rom-com movie which was based on some old book and it unlocked a brand new passion inside of me, a passion which I never knew existed if I'm being perfectly honest with you.
I always loved to read and loved nothing more than to get lost in a good book but I never once saw myself as a writer because I didn't think I was creative enough to be one.
All of that changed as soon as I put pen to paper or my fingers to my laptop I should say and that's when magic happened.
Within two months, I had finished and completed my first book The Billionaire's Secret Baby which later turned into a five-part series when my fans demanded more from me.
The series was a huge hit and before I knew it, I was a world-famous author, I was successful and I was rolling in the money, most of which I've either invested or I've put into different bank accounts for me and my kids for when they're older.
The rest of the money I used to buy us our current home and everything we needed to furnish it and I also bought myself a decent car as well.
I mean, I'm not at Donald Trump's level of rich but I've got enough money for me and the triplets to live happy and comfortable lives together.
Right now I'm in my office working on a new book and a new series but for some strange reason, I can't seem to concentrate and for the first time in my writing career, I've got writer's block.
I let out a sigh as I take off my glasses and rub the bridge of my nose.
This is so frustrating and annoying.
The worst thing for a writer to experience is knowing what you want to write and how you want to write it but being unable to articulate it in the right way and have it make sense.
There have been many times in the past where I've written something and when I've read it back I was baffled. this makes absolutely no sense.
I looked back at the screen and decided I needed to take a break, so I got up and went into the kitchen to make myself a cup of coffee and something to eat.
I didn't really have much of an appetite but I knew if I didn't eat something now then I probably wouldn't have anything to eat until dinner later on which wouldn't do me any good.
You need to be healthy in your mind, body and soul in order to do anything and I can't focus on writing a great story if I'm pushing myself without resting or eating.
I was sitting on the couch and eating my food with the television on in the background which I wasn't watching, it was just on for background noise because I hate silence and that's all I ever seem to have in this house when the kids aren't here.
Anyway, the T.V. quickly caught my attention when the annoying presenter with a high-pitched squeaky voice, who was wearing more make-up than a drag queen mentioned several familiar names which piqued my interest, one of which and the gossip about him almost had me choking on my coffee.
""Hello everyone and welcome to the Hollywood Daily, it's been a busy week for many of the Hollywood elite, more specifically those within the affluent Carpenter and Black families""
The presenter said with a huge grin on her face.
The first piece of news she was gossiping about was my sister-in-law Sabrina launching two new clothing lines, one is a maternity line and one is for kids which will be released after Christmas.
This will be her third and fourth lines that she's released, the first one being a bikini line and the second one was an undergarment line which she worked on with my mom.
""Brace yourselves ladies and gentlemen because the latest announcement from the Carpenter family is one that is going to break all of our precious little hearts, Luca Carpenter the youngest son of James and Louise Carpenter has come out as gay""
This is the news which had me almost choking on my coffee.
What does she mean he's come out as gay?.
Didn't he do that six years ago?.
""According to a statement released earlier today, Luca said it's taken me a very long time to finally accept who and what I am and now I can proudly say that I'm a gay man""
Holy cow.
""But that's not the most shocking part of the statement, the part which has left many of the public including fans of the family baffled and scratching their heads in confusion is when Luca also confessed his undying love for his soulmate and the love of his life Dylan Tate...does that name ring a bell? well, it should do because Dylan is the eldest son and heir of Lachlan and Sandra Tate and he's the former fiance of Luca's younger sister Lacey Carpenter who has been M.I.A for the past six years, are Luca and Dylan the reason for her disappearance from the limelight? has this love story been going on for a lot longer than the Carpenters want us to believe? this is something we may never know unless Luca, Dylan or even Lacey herself comes out and explains it to us""
I can't believe this.
It's a good job I legally changed my name six years ago before I gave birth to my kids because if I didn't, then this could have caused a lot of trouble for me and my kiddies.
""Moving on, we've got everyone's favourite billionaire playboy Logan Black who is as much known for his dating life as he is for his wealth, businesses and modelling career, the fitness model and business mogul is known for having a different woman on his arm every week but is his bachelor life officially over? it seems so after the sexy hunk was spotted shopping at one of New York's most expensive jewellery stores with singer and actress GiGi Addams""
What?.
It hurt my heart to hear about Logan settling down with someone else, especially with a snake like GiGi Addams.
Deep down in my heart, I knew why it hurt me so much but I just didn't want to admit to it.
I had always had a crush on Logan ever since I was a kid and I think somewhere over the years, that crush manifested into something more but I really didn't want to confess to those feelings because he's my older brother's best friend and also because of Dylan, not to mention Logan is everything I hate in a man.
He's cocky and conceited and he thinks if the world doesn't revolve around him then it should or at least that's how he was six years ago, I don't know if he's changed at all since I left the States.
I couldn't help but smile a sad and bittersweet smile as the presenter continued to talk about my family and those who used to be close to me and it really hurt my heart because I miss them so freaking much and I hate hearing about them and what's new in their lives through channels like this.
Changes are a natural part of life but sometimes it's the ones you weren't expecting that cause you the most pain and sorrow but also the most happiness  [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1744330422.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False
1jwctyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1jwctyc/heal_your_eczema/,HEAL YOUR ECZEMA:,"this is a full guide for you or anyone you know suffering with eczema on all the possible things that they can do to help their condition improve, if your sick of suffering with it all the time then give it a read:

‚ÄúTHE CURE‚Äù - HOW TO FIND YOURS
the truth is with eczema and skin diseases alike is that there truthfully is no ‚ÄúCURE‚Äù that will work for everyone the same, there is no diet that will heal all and there is no special cream that can be applied to cure anyone of us however there are many many things we can all try to improve our skin health, reverse our inflammation and be healthy and happy with this short time we have in this life.
Im going to explain all of the things you can consider as an eczema sufferer:
Its a lot of information and may be overwhelming so I‚Äôm going to break this down into different sections so feel free to read or skip the ones your interested in as you go ill also preface this with the fact that healing is not 1 dimensional and that we must heal many foundations of our life in order to heal our immune systems and reverse the inflammation in our bodies and skin.

SOCIAL / FAMILY / LOVE LIFE:
The people in your life matter, you also must matter to them, they must be willing to meet your basic need within the relationship this includes listening to your struggles and helping you in whatever ways they can within reason, same goes for you as you must contribute to the relationship by listening to their needs and hearing them out too. It must be balanced and you sometimes must make compromises however in your journey to healing its SO IMPORTANT that the people in your life understand that your condition effects your quality of life and the activities you are able and unable to do, remember that eczema is a disability and the people in your life must understand what this means for your capabilities and ability to function in everyday life. Its okay to rely on loved ones in times of desperate need and struggle but you must remember that the biggest person who can help you is.. YOU (don‚Äôt give up on helping yourself completely and rely on others solely to help as it will cause unbalance in your relationships/friendships and may not help you as much as you think it is)
in summary put effort into the relationships that are meaningful and helpful to you and your skin and don‚Äôt focus on the relationships that are toxic and bad for your mental health (sometimes our own family can be toxic in this case if your unable to get away from them you must plan out a way you can tolerate and deal with them trying your best to reason and explain things through with them - this might still not work and i can understand what its like to feel alone in this world with your condition but you must stick through the hard times and keep a strong mind as i promise this pain is not permanent and does not have to be as bad as it is now as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

LIFESTYLE CHOICES:
this is a big topic and i am not one to judge any of you as i have done many of the listed lifestyle choices in my past so ill simplify it down to the basics; the choices we make in our life can lead to stress and inflammation for our bodies to deal with, for people with eczema the more of these stressful or inflammatory choices we make in our lives the harder it is for our bodies to deal with our condition and keep our skin in good health, some of these choices i have listed may effect you differently but speaking from personal experience many of them will most likely worsen your physical or mental health which will in turn impact your eczema symptoms, ill list off as many as i can here but there is probably more I‚Äôve missed:
‚Ä¢participating in risk taking behaviours
‚Ä¢drinking alcohol / binge drinking
‚Ä¢taking recreational drugs
‚Ä¢smoking or vaping 
‚Ä¢binge eating or under eating
‚Ä¢eating processed food / sugar
‚Ä¢caffeine (high amounts causes anxiety and depression in many people it also increases stress as its a stimulant so just be careful of how much you drink and where its sourced - energy drinks are really not ideal whereas green tea or coffee is pretty okay for most people)
‚Ä¢social media - too much can cause stress and lead to more inflammation (no ones perfect and everyone is guilty of over use even me! just be aware of your use and minimise it as best you can.
‚Ä¢situations that impact your skin could include going to raves / clubbing or going to places that stress you out such as being in a really busy place can stress you out impacting your skin.

ENVIRONMENT:
factors in the environment can impact your skin and also make it easier / harder for you to heal. There are many factors when it comes to environment so ill break them down into sections explaining each separately:
‚Ä¢THE SUN - it is important to get vitamin D and sunlight daily not only for your skin health but also for your sleep, mood and energy levels as well as your digestion and appetite. Even in times where your very inflamed you should try to get in the direct sunlight as much as you can (unless your medically diagnosed as allergic to the sun which is extremely rare in which case supplement vitamin D and hope for the best)
‚Ä¢POLLEN - pollen changes from place to place and from year to year the levels of pollen are always different, some people do well with antihistamines or with a low histamine diet however for me i have recently cured my skin and allergies through an elimination diet and gradual exposure to pollen which has almost completely got rid of my life long pollen allergies, we are all different so please experiment and see what works or what doesn‚Äôt work, if you are taking meds for allergies and your allergies are still there or worse than ever then just consider a period where you don‚Äôt take them or change the type of medication (I‚Äôve tried dozens that didn‚Äôt work so for me using no meds works the best) the body is a highly complicated machine that will work properly given the right procedures are taken out for it - everyone has a different approach that will work for them 
‚Ä¢DUST / DUST MITES - heres an allergy that i still have to this day (it has improved). Dust and Dust mites are almost everywhere, on your bedding, floor, carpets, in the air and on all the furniture in your house (i know its scary to think) you can get rid of a certain amount of these dust mites, if your skin is super inflamed id suggest washing bedding and changing it at least once to twice a week (up to you) rinsing it twice each time to remove remaining traces of soap (if your allergic), next we have dust in other areas of your house if you have a hoover then hoover around corners and the floors of your room / house to make sure theres as little dust as you can, consider investing in a good hoover if you can - alternatively using a damp cloth on any surface gets up dust very effectively just make sure you dry it with a towel straight after to prevent mould from forming- you can just do this in your bedroom if you don‚Äôt have the time or effort to do the whole house and if your really unmotivated politely ask a loved one to help out (explain why and they may be open to helping you)
one thing you may want to consider investing in is a air filter (you can get a cheap one i only use a cheap one and have never changed the filter just clean it every so often but it works great) as it may help to keep circulation around your room which means less dust - also keep a very small gap in your window open when in your room as this also helps.
‚Ä¢AIR POLLUTION - whether you live in a busy city, town or village or right by a junction / busy road air-pollution may be a factor to consider and for some it may be a trigger for your skin, id suggest avoiding really busy places as much as you can (it may be un avoidable) and alternatively finding some time to go somewhere less polluted if there is anywhere available even a local park can be really good for you to visit for a walk in your free time as the plants / trees absorb air pollution and make the air cleaner also even indoor places like clubs, bars, restaurants, raves etc can have air pollution in the form of steam / heat / air fresheners that may be irritating to your skin health so just consider these factors.

HYGIENE:
this is another big topic so ill make a few points on hygiene and why it is important to have a routine:
‚Ä¢INFECTION - Skin that is open / broken can be easily infected by a build up of bacterias which is not good and can worsen if left completely untreated, to prevent this from happening you should keep your skin clean and dry using products that your skin doesn‚Äôt react badly to and for some people the best products may be a fragrance free soap i have used one before in times where my skin was infected (be careful how often you use it as it can do harm if too much is applied) as of now i don‚Äôt use any soaps at all but if you want to use soaps or find one that works for you then don‚Äôt give up and keep trying them - for some people no soap is the better option as some of us are hyper sensitive.
‚Ä¢ROUTINE - Different people have different preferences and we all react differently so experiment with your routine, if you shower twice a day try taking baths instead or try reducing the amount of showers experiment with the temperature (colder the better) as hot water is the last thing your inflamed skin needs as it will worsen inflammation and dry the skin out, if showering is too painful then take a towel and dip it is cold / warm water then use it to wipe yourself clean and then dry with a dry towel (worked for me in my worst flare ups) as its less impact / water contact for your skin and can help keep you clean without hurting your skin as much.
‚Ä¢SOAP - I‚Äôve mentioned previously in the infection section but we are all different and there may be a soap that works for your skin it also may be time to try not using soap if your skin is reacting to soaps then it could be one of the missing links to heal so be honest with yourself and experiment with different soaps ideally find fragrance free natural soap as its less likely to irritate your skin.

 ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT:
alternative medicines can work for many people despite not all being medically researched or backed by doctors they can be anything from coffee enemas, salt flushes, natural supplements, plant oils and capsules. There are a lot of different options here so the main things i can suggest is do your research and please do not try multiple at once as you will not be able to tell which one is impacting your skin or which one isn‚Äôt so take a journal and be patient - note down changes in your health.

PRESCRIPTION TREATMENT:
they can work for many people temporarily; in some cases they do not work, there are many different prescribed medications so make sure you check the side effects and safe dose with your GP, it also doesn‚Äôt hurt to research any meds your going to take or are thinking about taking as sometimes doctors give outdated advice or simply the wrong advice in terms of medication (its happened to me several times so just watch out for it) different treatments can include:
MEDICATIONS:
‚Ä¢corticosteroids
‚Ä¢immunosuppressants
‚Ä¢antihistamines
‚Ä¢antibiotics
they come in different forms depending on prescription (injections, tablets, capsules, liquids, syrups, creams, lotions, gels, eyedrops and nasal sprays)
THERAPIES / TESTING:
‚Ä¢light therapy
‚Ä¢allergy testing (food/environmental)
‚Ä¢patch testing (contact triggers)

ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE:
having eczema can make exercising frequently very difficult depending on severity however it is very important you get movement in as frequent as you can in any form even if its walking outside or on a treadmill at a gym or even if you have no access to that consider light aerobics, stretching / yoga or weight lifting (can be light weights at low intensity so it doesn‚Äôt irritate your skin. Work your way up slowly but set achievable goals and meet them as best as you can 

CLOTHING:
Even your clothes can effect your eczema for some its best to wear loose clothing however this is down to what feels the most comfortable to your body and skin so do whats best for you.
You may even be allergic to certain dyes and materials found in your clothes so consider changing the clothes you wear try out 100% cotton, silk or even bamboo may be an option for you, i wear bamboo t shirts and cotton pants / hoodies most of the time as they are the most comfortable for my skin but you may be different so see for yourself.

DIET:
We all react differently to different foods and for some of us many foods make our eczema worse, typical trigger foods include:
cocoa, sugar, dairy, eggs, salicylates, oxalates, mustard, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes and nightshades (tomatoes / potatoes) also citrus can be very triggering for some of us. 
Allergy testing for food allergies can be useful however it is not 100% accurate and does not detect food sensitivities as they aren‚Äôt the same as allergies and it also does not necessarily give a definite answer to which foods are triggering you for example a test may say your only allergic to peanuts while other foods may still trigger you without you being allergic to them such as sugar. Its confusing if you dont understand it entirely ill explain what you can do with your diet to help your skin..
‚Ä¢AVOID SUGAR AND PROCESSED FOODS:
as much as you reasonably can the less of these foods you eat the better it will be for your skin health
‚Ä¢AVOID SNACKING TOO MUCH:
constantly eating food is not ideal for your gut or skin health and can impact your mental health and stress your system which will impact your skin.
‚Ä¢BE KIND TO YOURSELF:
we are all human and make mistakes but if you do slip up and cheat on your diet then be kind to yourself and remember you can turn it back around if you try really hard to stop and not spiral into binging.
‚Ä¢CONSIDER ELIMINATION DIETS:
eliminating trigger foods can be the missing link in many of our cases and it can completely change your life if you find an elimination diet that works, there are many to consider trying that may work for you such as low histamine diet, low carb diet, keto or carnivore / animal based diet; all of which can work for different people but its important to let your doctor know what your doing and also to monitor your bio markers for inflammation across the body, this includes; sleep, mood, hunger, energy and drive / motivation (all of which can improve with the right dietary changes) which when improved will improve your skin too

SUMMARY: 
healing is a very challenging thing to do so be kind on yourself and remember than every failure / mistake is just a lesson in disguise, when we are learning any skill in life it is almost impossible to get it perfect on your first try, good luck to everyone of you and thank you for reading.",1,1744330352.0,eczema,17,0.6,False

Imagine a world that is completely flat. One that the flat earthers had actually gotten correct. But instead of humans with 3-dimensional surfaces roaming around as superior species, it is instead filled to the brim with shapes and lines of all different sizes and colors, but with a strict hierarchy of how they may live. This world is the second-dimension. Many people get it wrong, and may write the wrong story of how it all happened, (not pointing fingers) but the facts they have gotten absolutely and PAINFULLY correct. If you want to get very deep, this place is called Euclydia, and was home to many shapes and lines that lived oblivious to the outside world of hospitality to different places. Dimensions. WORLDS. I have no clue why it was called Euclydia, but it was called that, and that may be the title we should use. 
	I have come to know that many of you have heard a shorter, more simplified version of the story you are about to read and hear, in many ways, and especially by the shape who destroyed this world that innocents lived among. I am one of the lucky few who had lived to write this story of what had actually happened, and how I am still here today. I preserve that you may be able to hear the full story of everything, of his story, and my story, and how they intertwined into an unstoppable 
Feat that destroyed  almost everything that I‚Äôve ever known and loved.
	To get a better understanding of Euclydia, you must know the hierarchy of shapes and what it means.
	
	Triangles
	Triangles, having the least amount of sides, have been seen at the top of hierarchy, and the rulers of the second dimension. In Euclydia, it is seen as an honor to have less sides, for it is good will to give more space for more servants and a category of less-honorable-shapes. Only one royal family was still alive that day that was very corrupt. One of the family members was the one to destroy everything.

	Circles
	Circles, even though have no sides at all, are seen as a lesser category even though they have no sides at all. It is proven that due to the circumference of a circle, that nonetheless, it is almost infinite, but is cut off and shortened as an excuse, and are in the second category instead. 
	




































Alacuta, Euclydia, 
20, 000,000,000 B.C: Tale One: Tale of a Telekinetic Toddler




The ranch twinkles beneath the starlight, and the sky seemed to scream, ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù over head. No. This never happened. This never happened at all. No sky. No stars. Proper poise. Be good. Be kind. Be the girl that your parents want you to be. And that‚Äôs when I snatched the locket from the birdie on the fencepost. 
Hi. My name is Glee Mourningstarr and I am 2 years old. Though I seem small, and tiny, I‚Äôm not. I am not what you think. I am not just some low-life monster like everyone says. I‚Äôm not the Star Demon. I‚Äôm not a star. I‚Äôm just me. Glee. And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll ever be. Sure enough, you might be asking why my brain works like this. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm different. That‚Äôs at least what my moms tell me. I‚Äôm different in good ways. Not bad. Like him. I‚Äôm a good different. Because I‚Äôm a good kid. That‚Äôs what mama Starly tells me. And because of the prayer that they sent, that‚Äôs the prayer that will be sent to me again. And it happened. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm Glee. And only Glee.
 I remember skipping along the green hills that surrounded the ranch, and I remember feeling the ground warm up as the sun started to hit the ranch at an angle that made it seem like it was a fairytale. Amulet in hand, one that I gave to all the birds around me so I could hear the thoughts of others, and back to understand what it meant. I am free. Because I live in Alacuta, with my Ma and my Mom, and they love me very much. And I love them too. My legs skipped across the ground into a sprint, and I made it to the house, stepped up the splintered porch, and into the house that seemed like a bunker. Emerica, my other mom, grew up in Alacuta. Her dad fought in the Naaric war, and she was raised on a military base. She was tough. And that was that. And that‚Äôs why I grew up in a bunker-asylum type home. My other mom, my Mama, Starly, did not like this so much. So she moved away to states all around us, to record birds and decipher what it meant from the ones I summoned.
They were always different.
But the good different.
Like me.
She went away often, so only a few moments I would get to see her. Her personality was like a sweet butternut type of cotton candy. Like a banana bread that she made, hard on the outside, soft on the inside, except swapped. She was sweet this way. And that‚Äôs what I love about her different. Her good different. My other ma, as you knew as Emerica, was really like the banana bread. She was like bitter coffee, one that would make you recoil quicker than you could sip, before adding coffee creamer, the sweet side of her. But that was after. And in the middle of the coffee. The inside. She was stern and stiff either way. Hardworking, though, according to Starly. Emerica would work till the 3 suns on horizon point went down, and the moon covered the sky- no, the land. Just the land. And that was her different. As mine was, and as Starly was. 
Now, as you know, I‚Äôm hard working like Ma (Emerica), and I want to prove my worthiness as a Mourningstarr. So when  I opened that door, you should know that I am gonna get jump-scared with a big, fat-
‚ÄúGWYNNIE! WHERE THE HECK WERE YOU? WHY WERE YOU OUT THERE WHEN YOU NEED TO BE STUDYING YOUR MANDARIN!‚Äù Emerica screeched.
I sighed as I put down the locket.
Study.
No break.
Study hard.
And be perfect for her expectations.
And remember, always have a smile on your face.
‚ÄúCome ON mom, I‚Äôm hungry, can we eat breakfast? Why else would I be outside, if it weren‚Äôt for the wait, I would be-‚Äù
‚ÄúMANDARIN.‚Äù
‚ÄúÂ¶àÂ¶àÔºåÂ¶ÇÊûú‰Ω†Áé∞Âú®‰∏çÁªôÊàëÂñÇÊó©È§êÔºåÊàëÂ∞±ÂêÉÊéâ‰Ω†.‚Äù
‚ÄúHa, try that when your mom comes over again, your gonna be deader than the boy when she sees you ate me, now-‚Äù
	‚Äú≈ålelo Hawai ªi pupule,  ª≈çlelo  ªo Ma i ka  ª≈çlelo haole, no ke aha e hiki  ªole ai iƒÅ mƒÅkou ke  ª≈çlelo pƒìlƒÅ, MƒÅmƒÅ?!‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs her ethnicity and you better respect it, kid.‚Äù
‚ÄúFINE! FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE! You don‚Äôt have to call me kid, cuz I‚Äôm not a kid anymore Mom-‚Äù
Emerica cuts me off.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, because you‚Äôre a toddler.‚Äù
Something switched off inside of me.
‚ÄúI might be a toddler‚Ä¶but at least I don‚Äôt act like one‚Ä¶like some people‚Ä¶‚Äù
Emerica slammed her fist down on the table, the clank echoing through the air.
‚ÄúWhat was that?!‚Äù
‚ÄúNOTHING MA!‚Äù
	I breathed with a sudden flinch. Emerica softened into a menacing stance.
‚ÄúGood. Cuz‚Äô if you ain‚Äôt doin‚Äô nuttin‚Äô, then you‚Äôll be doin‚Äô somethin‚Äô, cuz‚Äô you‚Äôll be tilling the farm and herbs today.‚Äù
‚ÄúMOOOO-OOOM-‚Äù
‚ÄúNo whining! Now get to work!‚Äù
Emerica screeched as she walked over to a steel closet that looked like it could chill spines, and threw a steel rake, like the closet, at me.
‚ÄúAnd then maybe‚Ä¶we can go to the park today.‚Äù
She said with a snap so soft, but honest, and she took a beer bottle and walked out the door, off the patio, and into Mourningstarr farms.
I grumbled. 
I hated farm work, especially with herbs. But of course, I had my own hope, because of what Emerica said that she thought I didn‚Äôt hear.
‚ÄúAnd then maybe‚Ä¶we can go to the park today.‚Äù
The park.
The park was a gateway to a new world!
	A place where Gwendolyn Charly Mourningstarr could be herself! God, I love the park so much!
And if you're wondering, that‚Äôs why I followed Emerica out down past the patio ranch, into the wilderness of herbs, vegetables, wheat, animals, and more.
All because of the park.

Los Equalateris, Euclydia, 20,000,000,000,000 B.C 
‚ÄúPINKIE UP! LITTLE SIPS, NOT DRASTIC MEASURES OF GULPING LIKE A LOPSIDED ELEPHANT, YOU OAF!‚Äù
	5:00 A.M.
That has got to be a new record.
5:00 A.M just to take your pitiful little, ‚Äúoaf‚Äù, of a son to tea lessons. All too soon, I would say. But when your hierarchy stance is tall, you might have to just suck it up, Bill.
‚ÄúSIP NEATLY, SIP, YOU‚ÄôRE NOT JUST SOME TYPE OF, RANCHER, ARE YOU?! THEN SIP!‚Äù
	I bite back a wince as mom slaps my hands into a cramping position to hold the tea correctly. I just don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm not normal. I see the stars. They don‚Äôt believe me. The government (even dad) says it‚Äôs illegal, and they take me to take pills from the doctors to convince everyone, I'm ‚Äònormal.‚Äô But I‚Äôm not. I see the stars. And I‚Äôm on the top hierarchy. So what? Who gives a crap? The public? Well, yeah, I guess they do, since father is the mayor of our world of our second dimension, so why wouldn‚Äôt they want to commit treason against me? Just give Euclydia a bunch of knives, and they‚Äôll figure it out. That‚Äôs what my parents did for my last two birthdays. Yup. I‚Äôm two years old. Toddler, but being forced to hierarchy even though it‚Äôs not gonna happen because of my eye. But that‚Äôs what happens in our mighty home. Triangle, squares and circles on top, irregulars, multicolors, stars, Naarics, and extraterrestrials on the bottom.
‚ÄúGood, good, now you‚Äôll be prepared when a rancher tries to be your friend when we move from Los Equalateris to Alacuta.‚Äù
Ranchers.
That‚Äôs what top hierarchies call the low hierarchies. I‚Äôve heard it so many times, it has been stained into my brain and memory. And now that we are moving to the rancher category to prove to the whole world of our region that just because we are on the top hierarchy stance,  it doesn‚Äôt mean that we hate, (We do) mom is making me learn all the proper manners that way if someone tried to hang out with me‚Ä¶
They won‚Äôt.
Lesson #1: Don‚Äôt ever hang out with a rancher, even if you live among them. 
After mom made me play some notes and such on the piano, with parts she made me press through to memorize and get perfectly on every try, dad walked through the cascading doors of our large mansion, something we got because, duh, dad‚Äôs the mayor of Euclydia. The door slammed, and I raced down the stairs to greet him. 
Out of this entire family relationship, he was the only one that I DIDN‚ÄôT want to trick into bashing their head in with a piano lid. I hugged him, letting my arms wrap as much I could around him, but of course, he did a better job.
‚ÄúHey kiddo,‚Äù Dad breathed.
‚ÄúHello da-father.‚Äù I corrected myself, while gently pulling away, a cringed look plastered on my face. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay kid. You can say that in front of me, just not in front of your mom. She‚Äôll probably kill us both this time. SCALENE!‚Äù
	His voice echoed through the halls, as a response came tumbling through as well.
‚ÄúEUCLID! ARE THE DRIVERS HERE TO PICK UP BILL AND TAKE HIM TO ALACUTA?!?!‚Äù 
Dad sighs, and adjusts his tophat, before grabbing my hand and leading me to the door unexpectedly.
‚ÄúYes honey bun, I‚Äôm taking him over right now‚Ä¶‚Äù
He had answered mom wearily.
‚ÄúGOOD! I want that disgrace out of this house right now- erm, lovely, child‚Ä¶out into the van now! Chop chop, Euclid!‚Äù 
My eye widened wider as I replayed what mother had said in my head. Disgrace? Surely, I had one eye and could see things I shouldn‚Äôt be able to see, but that shouldn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm any‚Ä¶.DIFFERENT‚Ä¶.then anyone‚Ä¶.right?
Dad gripped the side of me ... or‚Ä¶if triangles could have a side/like shoulder to them‚Ä¶.eh. He lifted me up and took me in his arms, wrapping me up in a tangle of them once again.
‚ÄúCome on kid, you heard mom.‚Äù
‚Äú...‚Äù
‚ÄúBill, did she scare you?‚Äù
‚Äú...‚Äù
‚ÄúBill.‚Äù
‚Äú...‚Äù
‚ÄúBILL.‚Äù
‚Äú...‚Äù
‚ÄúBILL CIPHER, answer me, does that croak in the throat scare you?!‚Äù
‚ÄúALIVE, I‚Äôm alive, sorry father, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù
I point behind him.
Because there was fuming mom.
The doors to the inside of the mansion opened, and a bunch of fancy men in tuxedos, like circles and squares paraded in. One of them looked 3 years older than me, 5, and looked like a purple square. He had one eye too, though, on the side of his face. Downside, he‚Äôs not like me. 
As they took me to the limo with the postured, purple square by my side, I heard rampant fighting, and throwing, and crashing from the inside. But the louder, more dominant voice was not masculine. I found a newfound interest at looking at my feet now, and the square did as well. 
The boy held onto a rainbow swirled lolly, and we piled into the limo.
‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶.‚Äù The boy whispered.
‚ÄúHi‚Ä¶‚Äù I said back. He wasn‚Äôt a rancher. I was safe from mom‚Äôs fiery wrath of racism.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tad. Strange. Tad Strange. Although there's nothing really‚Ä¶how do ya say it‚Ä¶STRANGE‚Ä¶about me‚Ä¶who are you?‚Äù
Well, if that eye doesn‚Äôt count, then believe whatcha wanna believe, lover boy. I thought to myself while looking into space, well, the air, remember? Space doesn‚Äôt exist in Euclydia, according to the government. My brain bubble popped back to reality when he elbowed me. 
‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were gonna tell me your name, remember?‚Äù
	‚ÄúOh, right. How can you not know me, I‚Äôm the mayor's son!‚Äù
Tad licked his lolly, and let his eye slowly relax.
‚ÄúOh, yeah, I don‚Äôt really listen to political biz. My mom put me into the show biz instead, big opportunities when you are on the top hierarchy. Mom made me accompany you on the limo so it‚Äôs not awkward for you-‚Äù
	‚Äú...You're an actor?‚Äù
	‚ÄúYup. The best in town. And in Euclydia. Or maybe even just the entire dimension-‚Äù He giggles, his eye going bright. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve even starred on the Oprah Winfrey show once! I‚Äôm so awesome. You gotta admit it‚Ä¶.errrr-‚Äù
Oh. He was talking about himself so much like a narcissistic brat, that I almost forgot to introduce myself.
‚ÄúOh. Bill. I‚Äôm Bill Cipher.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou gotta admit it Bill, nothing can beat me.‚Äù
I rolled my eye playfully, and he laughed contiguously, and of course, it spread to me.
‚ÄúSo you really were on the Oprah Winfrey show for best acting once?!‚Äù I shrieked. The limo driver, a lime green double stacked circle, turned to stare at me, putting a lip to his eye, and shushed me. I sunk into the leather seat, and Tad giggled. 
‚ÄúYeah. She‚Äôs cool. She‚Äôs a star.‚Äù
The limo stopped immediately, and the driver turned his head toward us slowly again. 
I practically leapt onto Tad, and covered his eye‚Ä¶or whatever the speaking came from.
‚ÄúSHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, THAT WORD IS ILLEGAL, DON‚ÄôT SAY IT, OR ELSE WE ARE BOTH GONNA END IN TIMEOUT, OR worse‚Ä¶‚Äù
Tad looked at me in fear, and he made the cutthroat symbol. 
Lesson #2: Euclydia doesn‚Äôt fear strict punishment for execution, even for the little things.
Thankfully, the limo driver just reared in for a sneeze, and the car keeped on going.
We sat in awkward silence for the rest of the drive, looking out the window at the states as we drove through. Eventually, I had to get off, to the new home, and destination, and I turned a blind eye to wave goodbye to the first boy who ever really wanted to talk to me, almost like a friend. He stared at me, before shaking a no, and turning away. Another cold shoulder. I got those a lot. Even from the ones who I thought liked me. The car drove away, leaving me lonely and alone in a new state of Euclydia. Alacuta.

All for me, and only me to explore.

 	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	
‚ÄúTo the park! To the PARK!‚Äù I  screamed in a charade as Mom followed me down the grassy swamp trail. 
I loved the park. 
Although no one wanted to play any games with me, or even try to be my friend, (because baby I‚Äôm a PENTAGRAM)I still enjoy letting out what my mom calls, ‚Äúmy potential energy.‚Äù Basically, it‚Äôs me letting out my gleeful bursts of energy I hide all day while finishing chores on the ranch. Mom hates when I mess around on chore time. I guess I can see why, it probably is pretty hard to keep a hyperactive child in sync with chores. 
OINK! OINK!
	Oh yeah! I forgot to introduce you to my pig, Pig Pen! 
I‚Äôve kept him on Mourningstarr farms for a few years now. Ma had him as a pet, and when Mom came around, she wanted to turn him into a bacon meal. Luckily, with a few charismatic moves, Ma convinced Mom not too. 
And that‚Äôs how we still have the darling Pig Pen with us still today!
And of course, I‚Äôll bring him to the park if I want to.
Because even though he isn‚Äôt Euclidean, he still is to me.
Pig Pen oinks excitedly as we approach the entrance of the dingy old, broken park.
Perfect.
Just like home.
I approached the monkey bars, and climbed on, wrangling around like a little monkey, like Mom says. 
Mom was sitting on the bench, smoking a cigar, and puffing out slow rings as she watched me.
Kids played around me, and that‚Äôs when I saw them. 3 of them. And not just any kids. 
The kids who saw me.
Not Glee.
But the real me.
	The part that actually makes me‚Ä¶.different.
I hung at the top, and watched them curiously to see what they were doing. I scoffed as I saw the 3 kids, Cylinder, who was double stacked with ovals, and a Scare Ball cap, being green. Another one, a stunning Naaric, who wore a long dress shirt, and was brown. Lilac. The last one, was someone who actually experienced it more than ever. Jeez Louis. What I could best describe as what looked like a ‚Ä¶taco? A pink taco with a party hat. And two eyes. The leader of the group. And they were all surrounding some kid‚Ä¶a triangle? No. Not just any triangle.

A one eyed triangle.


* 	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*
‚ÄúDoh- QUIT IT!‚Äù 
I screamed as they all mocked me. I felt anger siege through me. I‚Äôm telling the damn truth! 
Why don‚Äôt they believe me‚Ä¶?
‚ÄúHe thinks he is SOOO special just because he is the mayor‚Äôs son, but when out in Alacuta, he‚Äôs nuttin‚Äô but wrong.‚Äù The Naaric girl spat. 
I didn‚Äôt get it.
They should be bowing DOWN to me.
After all, I gave them knives, AND the privilege to work on my dad‚Äôs basic land. They should be grateful.
‚ÄúPotato brain probably doesn‚Äôt work because he still thinks he‚Äôs still in Los Equalateris!‚Äù The green one cackled, and the rest joined in in terrifying unison.
They shoved me to the ground, and I dropped my luggage. I came to the park after I got everything set up in my new home to meet new people, and tell them about the stars, not to be shoved around like some piccolo bust! 
The pink, taco looking shape came close. ‚ÄúListen here, and listen NOW. You think you‚Äôre so fancy, and you think you‚Äôre so cool and poised because you come to the highest family in the land. You think you‚Äôre more important than us ranchers. You think just because your mommy and daddy send us to work out in the fields, farms, ranches and mines to make their broken economy-wise plan make ‚Äòem feel good, that you can just boss us around and tell us things that are even more fake than the hierarchy plan. Well you‚Äôre wrong, lover boy. You‚Äôre wrong times all the lies your cheatin‚Äô-apple tossing double cross cotton lickin‚Äô book burnin‚Äô back whippin‚Äô olive prickin‚Äô short eyed parents had ever told you. Because now that you‚Äôre here, your pretty cover-boy face ain‚Äôt gonna look so pretty anymore. While, at least with the eye, of course.‚Äù
They all laughed as they circled closer. That hurt. Hurt times 63. And now that they were gonna hurt me, I could only brace for the worst backlash punishment my little two-year toddler brain could comprehend. 
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm telling you, the stars, they are real!‚Äù
	‚ÄúIs what he said before we hurt his pretty little-‚Äù
‚ÄúA-a-a-a-a-a-a-a‚Ä¶A-‚Äù The Naaric stuttered.
The pink taco sighed. 
‚ÄúGod, what is it NOW, Lilac?‚Äù
	Then, it was the green double stacked guy.
 ‚ÄúA-a-a-as‚Ä¶-As-Ast‚Ä¶‚Äù
	‚ÄúOH MY GOD, AND NOW IT‚ÄôS ZACH, JUST TELL ME BEFORE IT‚ÄôS YOU TWO ARE THE ONES THAT I VICIOUSLY HURT-‚Äù
Taco guy quickly turned around, but from the looks of it, really regretted it. And then, again, like the laughs before they stuttered, screeched-
‚ÄúA-STAR!!!!‚Äù
	I slowly turned around and saw a one eyed, magenta star, with a maroon like french hat, and green on the end of well‚Ä¶whatever those things were. And of course, why wouldn‚Äôt the gleeful looking thing be hanging upside down from some monkey bars. She hopped down, and landed on some red boots. Surprisingly, she looked my age. And like me. 
A one eyed star. A STAR!
But like the purple dude, on the side of her face.
Double damn.
‚ÄúLook, I told you they exist!‚Äù I whimpered.
She then, for the first time, she spoke  her body defended me from the shivering and terrified bullies.
‚ÄúYeah, yeah, it‚Äôs me, ‚ÄúScary girl, the one who burned away half your home, friends and family,‚Äù we get it, we‚Äôre all ranchers, get over the fact of it. You‚Äôre not special, guys. And let‚Äôs admit, he isn‚Äôt either.‚Äù
	Flabbergasted, my eye widened, and my pupil shrunk in shock.
The dudes shrunk, and they looked at their feet.
‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs okay. So what if he isn‚Äôt special? Who actually gives a shit?‚Äù
	The majority raised their hands.
Including little ‚Äòol me. 
‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she breathed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs, like, really sad. Nonetheless- look, it doesn‚Äôt matter if he is royal, it doesn‚Äôt matter if he has- one, eye-‚Äù She unmistakably enunciated the, ‚Äòone,‚Äô ‚ÄúHe lives here now, and we need to be kind to him. And by the way, potatoes have more energy in their bodies then y‚Äôall three slacker-packer tomato factors combined. And that‚Äôs all to charge an electronic. They're also the smartest veggie there is, and that‚Äôs no doubt. So not only do you call geek attack smart, you also called him athletic, and dunced yourself before even thinking first. Boom. Science. Mic. Drop.‚Äù
	I felt my face burn. No one ever complimented me like that. Ever. 
And at the same time, no answer from the gang in front of us.
Until they ran out of the park‚Äôs playground, screaming- ‚ÄúA-STAAAAAR-!‚Äù, leaving me and the star alone in the park playground. She sighed, and screamed after them- ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS ASTAR, you idiots, ASTAR! GET IT RIGHT, OR DON‚ÄôT SAY IT AT ALL!‚Äù
	She walked over to a bench, and crossed her arms, sitting on a bench, with a huff. 
	I followed her, and sat next to her, in awe.
	‚ÄúNot that Astar is still my name, anyways‚Ä¶‚Äù She mumbled.
	I looked at her in awe, eye shining.
	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a star‚Ä¶‚Äù
	I mumbled. I was right-
	‚ÄúWoah, woah, WOAH, I don‚Äôt associate with stars anymore, I am NOT a star, don‚Äôt EVER call me that, I am a PENTAGRAM. Say it with me, PENTAGRAM. PENTAGRAM.‚Äù
	We said it together. 
	‚ÄúPentagram.‚Äù
	‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she responded. ‚ÄúAnyways, I‚Äôm Glee Mourningstarr. My friends call me Glee. That is‚Ä¶.if I had any‚Ä¶‚Äù
	I looked down again, pitying the girl. 
	Lesson #3: Don't ever talk to or befriend a rancher, even if they seem more than the picture.
	No.
	We're both friendless.
	Alone.
	And in need of someone like each other. 
	I extended my hand, and looked her in the eye with a happy, relaxed look.
	‚ÄúIt's nice to meet you, Glee,‚Äù I remarked, ‚ÄúI'm Bill. Bill Cipher.‚Äù
	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	
‚ÄúMeet my mama! Emerica!‚Äù
I shrieked as I led Bill over to my ma. With one overlook, ma grabbed me, tenseness first heard in her voice. 
‚ÄúGWYNN, HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS BOY?! I DEMAND YOU TO LEAVE MY DAUGHTER ALONE AT ONCE, YOU, YOU FREAK!‚Äù
	The boy stumbles backward, and I gasp at my mother. 
	‚ÄúMA, HE‚ÄôS NOT A FREAK! I‚Äôm a cyclops, you don‚Äôt think that of me ... .do you?‚Äù
	Ma looks at me, flabbergasted, before groaning, and pulling me back again.
	‚Äú....No, of course I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs different. He can actually see‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶‚Äù She gulps, and nudges towards the sky- well, as much as she could anyways‚Ä¶.
I gulped back.
I grab the boy's hand and look Ma in the eyes.
The boy finished the gulp triangle.
	‚ÄúWell, Ma, if that‚Äôs how you feel‚Ä¶.if‚Ä¶ergh! I can hear the stars!‚Äù
	I storm off with the boy towards the park, and Ma looks at me in disgust and shock. Of course, I couldn‚Äôt see her, but‚Ä¶I could FEEL the prickles of her sight on my neck.
	And it does NOT feel good.
	‚ÄúSorry about my Ma‚Ä¶.she‚Ä¶gets that way about newcomers. Actually, she gets that way about everyone except me. She‚Äôs a hater.‚Äù
	We both glance back at ma, and she shoots back a mortifying stare.
	The boy shivers.
	‚ÄúYup. That‚Äôs a hater.‚Äù
	‚ÄúWhat about your Ma, where is she-‚Äù
	‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs not here-‚Äù
	Just then, a limo pulled in. A pretty fancy one too. All black like the burnt toasts that Ma makes for me in the mornings when it‚Äôs time to work the fields, and shiny like the toy weapons she gives me as she trains me for what she calls, ‚Äúone-day-you-might-need-this-hand-to-knife-combat-skill-when-the-second-
Naaric-war-occurs,‚Äùor some crap that her pa taught her after he got home after the first Naaric War. (fought on the Naaric side, if you‚Äôre wondering)  I watched as a fancy blue shape and a red one, both triangles, piled out 
the car, more elegant than my mind could comprehend. I saw their expressions, too. 
One overlook at the playground, and I could tell who they were. 
The royal family.
I turned to the boy, and decided to make an inference off of what he‚Äôd say. 
‚ÄúHey, who is that, they look really-‚Äù
‚ÄúMom.‚Äù
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my mom. You were‚Ä¶wondering.‚Äù
He seemed to wince the last words out in a strain.
‚ÄúOh. Wait, wait, wait, wait ... .I knew you were special, but I didn‚Äôt know you were the boy!‚Äù
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
‚ÄúTHE BOY! The boy that everyone knows about, the one who is a cyclops, the one who can see the FREAKIN‚Äô-....stars?‚Äù
‚ÄúSHUT UP!‚Äù He said, his face flushing. 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let mom know that I was telling 
people about myself without her know-
Ing! She‚Äôs‚Ä¶.very secretive‚Ä¶.about me‚Ä¶.‚Äù
The red one walked over to us two, and 
I gawked unknowingly at how beautiful 
she was. She had perfect sides, she was 
the perfect tint of cherry, as if the hea-
vens saw her as an opportunity to make 
something beautiful out of the leftover
charm they had in a bucket. She turned 
towards the boy, and hugged him like he was 
the last thing living in this world. 
In a speculated  and refined tone that reflected 
a gruff British accent, she had an outburst.
‚ÄúOH SAINT HEAVENS, BILLY, YOU‚ÄôRE ALRIGHT, LET‚ÄôS GO TO OUR NEW HOME NOW, other than‚Ä¶this ... .pigsty‚Ä¶.‚Äù
	I could tell she really enunciated that last word.
	Pigsty.
	Because of us RANCHERS. 
	It made me want to SPIT.
	After smothering the boy with a hug, she turned to me, looked me up and down like she did to the park earlier, and immediately spat out words that I got all the time. 
	‚ÄúWho is this little narc, and what‚Äôs she doing around you, Bill?‚Äù
	The boy turned around from the hug, and reached his hand out to me. I smiled a warm smile, or, what I think was a smile, never can really tell, and reached to his hand as well.
	Before the fancy class woman slapped my hand away.
	‚ÄúSweetie pie, you know and you have always known that you can NOT befriend a RANCHER! Ugh, GOD, we are DEFINITELY gonna give you a long bath when we get home, come along, Bill, we are going hom- WAH!‚Äù
	All of a sudden, another hand slapped the lady before taking the boy home. 
	I could recognize the power in enough time to know who it was. 
	It was-
	‚ÄúMA! What are you doing, if he has to go home, then he has to go home-‚Äù
	‚ÄúNO! This big brat insulted you, and no one insults MY daughter! NO ONE INSULTS A MOURNINGSTARR!‚Äù
	The lady stopped walking away, and the boy turned towards me once again.
	The lady, in a low, menacing voice spoke softly, but you could tell she met BUSINESS.
	‚ÄúDid you say...Mourningstarr?‚Äù
	Ma took my hand, and pushed me behind her.
‚ÄúHello, Scalene.‚Äù
The air was so thick, you could cut it with a knife.
It only got thicker when the lady responded.
‚ÄúHello, Emerica.‚Äù
Ma laughed, which only made me grateful to be able to hide behind her even more.
‚ÄúWow, look who finally came crawling BACK for more‚Ä¶old friend.‚Äù

	I don‚Äôt know exactly what is going on, but I do NOT like it. I honestly have been in a tangle of spaghetti, (my favorite food) since I met this Glee girl. First she shook my hand and made a deal that she‚Äôd always be my friend if I promised the same. Next, she showed me around the park to show me who to become friends with, (if I can, no joke, she is BRUTALLY honest) 
and who to silently avoid. Then, she told me about how much birds love to follow her, and sometimes just appear. This was the tip of the iceberg of my confusion. Then, she showed me her mom. Then mother appeared out of nowhere. And now apparently, our moms are enemies
with each other! (at least, that‚Äôs what I think, according to what mother says about tone of voice) 
	Just one question: What the HELL is GOING on?!?! (Excuse my profanity)
I turned to Glee, who shared my same confusion, and then I turned to Mother, who seemed to be fuming in frustration. Well, at least what I thought was mere frustration.
‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL EMERICA, IT‚ÄôS BEEN 4 YEARS, AND ALL THE SUDDEN YOU COME CRAWLING BACK TO ME LIKE ALL OF YOUR RANCHER ALLIES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE DUST!‚Äù Mother turns to me, lowering her voice into a whisper- ‚ÄúAnd for good reason too,‚Äù She snickered, and I guess that is what she met for triggering a snicker from me as well. So in order not to be hurt by her dangerous wrath, I went along and snickered like a wicked wizard as well. Although everyone could tell that my giggles were a sham, out of the corner of my eye, I could see Glee, sulking as if she was betrayed by her most beloved friend in the world. 
‚ÄúScalene, you know why I had to leave, I did it for my family-‚Äù
‚ÄúCorrection, your FUTURE family. You left our‚Ä¶.friendship to go be with that stupid little freakshow of a mistake Charly-‚Äù
‚ÄúStarly.‚Äù
‚ÄúStarly, who whatever that bitch‚Äôs new name is- however, you knew we had a chance for our dreams. But you gave up immediately for that lady, and now you come crawling back to me after such a short time, just as I speculated. And you barely made a family too. Just a little girl with one eye, who probably gets picked on more than usual. And not for the eye, for the parents instead.‚Äù
	Glee winces, recoiling in embarrassment, as far I could see. 
‚ÄúCorrection back at you, Mrs. Cipher, you came crawling back to ME in MY town, in MY home, your son to MY daughter, and to MY park. And for the record, your boy has one eye as well, more deformed then Glee, if I may say so myself, so you better mentally prepare him for the bullying he is about to endure. And ain‚Äôt no one saving him.‚Äù
Glee looked up at her Mother, and I could see the confusion in her eye.
‚ÄúMa, what do you mean?‚Äù
Emerica looks at Glee.
‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôre going home, and we‚Äôre leaving your silly little friend behind. Say goodbye to Bill. It‚Äôs gonna be the last time you‚Äôll ever be able to, too.‚Äù
Glee looked horrified, but she couldn‚Äôt resist when she started pulling on her wrist, tugging her in the direction away from me. 
	Emerica looks at Scalene in her eyes one more time, a loss of hope reflecting. 
‚ÄúGet out of my town. And don‚Äôt come back.‚Äù
	And with that Mother starting dragging me away, both Glee and me kicking and screaming. 
And then we never saw each other again.















































































					‚Ä¶Or so you thought.



	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


The following weeks, I hadn‚Äôt seen Bill around here at all. Ma pretends the interaction between my almost friend, and her old friend never happened, and if I have to be honest, I almost forgot as well. Until the night I was up in my room, playing a song on my banjo and singing with Pig Pen cuddled up on my bed when she opened the door, and I instinctively stopped playing, eyeing her eyes. 
‚ÄúGwynny,‚Äù She began, closing the door behind her, ‚Äúwe need to talk.‚Äù 
I put down my banjo into its case, and patted the spot on my messy bed next to me. Her surface crinkled as she saw Pig Pen, and sat at the very edge, avoiding the pig.
I avoided gaze. 
Ma and I weren't close. At least not close enough to cuddle like Mama and I do. I sighed as I pulled my legs up to my pentagram-shaped body, and held them like I did with Pig Pen most times I was in this position, and at the same, that pig sprawled onto my lap. I looked down at my feet, and scratched Pig Pen.
She avoided gaze.
Silence.
Until-
‚ÄúGwynny, you really have no clue why I had to separate you two, do you?‚Äù
Silence.
Until-
‚Äú...no. All I know is that you took away from the first friend I‚Äôve ever made right when you saw his mom. And you know how hard it is for me to be able to make friends.‚Äù
Silence.
Until-
‚Äú...I know. And that‚Äôs why I have to tell you a story.‚Äù
	Silence.
Until-
‚Äú....go on.‚Äù
	Silence.
Silence.
More silence.
Until finally-
‚ÄúWhen I was 18 years old, there was nothing more I wanted to do than spread the word about how unfair life was for us ranchers. Farmers. Field workers. How we were worked to death in the flaming hot suns until our backs gave out at the countless amount of times we were whipped. I said that I wanted to be a political activist as a young child. Your grandmother said otherwise. She was a smart one, and clearly said, ‚ÄòActivists rarely get paid, and what everyone needs now is a good stack of green ones. Become a talk show enthusiast. Become a host for what everyone really needs. To not just hear. To hear the truth.‚Äô So ever since that day, I wanted nothing more. Especially when the Naaric War broke out, I fought with the Naarics. I fought hard, and was scarred when your grandfather showed me everything a young 12 year old never had to see. I knew what it took. I had the guts, and I had the courage to speak the truth. When I was 16, I met a girl who int- met me- MET me at a party. Her name was Scalene. Yes. Bill‚Äôs mother. And, well, we became close friends despite our well‚Ä¶differences. I wanted to share the mistakes of the society her evil, corrupt family had made, and well, she wanted to fix them. We became close, going to college, getting noticed, and finally, being invited to another party that would seal the deal to our future. Our TALK SHOW. We got to the party, and that‚Äôs when I met her. Charly Winifry. Sister of Aubrey Winfrey, and yes, your mother. She was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, and I knew I had to talk to her. I walked over and chatted, and knew for sure that I had just fallen head over heels for a woman I shouldn‚Äôt have fallen for. That‚Äôs when Scalene noticed. And she was MAD. So mad that she left me. She left our dreams. She left Charly and I, well, we got married, and since Scalene was the main credit holder for our college debt to get the talk show, I had to go back to the farm, and work my butt off with your mother each day. We were eventually married, and lived a happy life, and after some sperm donors, we had you, Gwynny. Our little ray of sunshine. But the prayer, remember, we had to say it to change you into our little ray, remember? Astar?‚Äù
	Astonished at her story, I was quiet until I remembered she was asking me a question. 
‚ÄúI was mad‚Ä¶and the gods helped fix that. They gave me my blessing.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd if they didn‚Äôt?‚Äù
‚ÄúInstead of being a ray of sunshine, I‚Äôd be a ball of sunshine and they have fireballs,  balls of sunshine.‚Äù
	‚ÄúCorrect. And that‚Äôs why you got your blessing. And we better pray now to thank them. Got it?‚Äù

1jwcqwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1jwcqwb/gallbladder_or_no/,Gallbladder or no?,"Sorry for this sort of rambling post, but for the past 5-6 years (definitely pre-covid), I would have what I'll describe as a ""stomach migraine"" every few months.  Sometimes it's a cluster of them, but usually it's a singular attack that lays me up for an afternoon/evening, and then by the next morning I'm fine.  
I can usually tell an attack is building around lunch time and they're usually inevitable.    It starts as mild heart burn, but no taste in my mouth or burning though.  As it progresses, the burning gets worse, but it's not like I burped up a bunch of spicey food.  It's almost like a cramp under my solar plexus.   Burping seems to maybe help briefly, but then it gets worse and worse.   At its worse, I'm on the floor and feeling referred pain in the middle-ish of my back.   

It isn't a heart attack (I've actually gone to the ER and had an ECG).  It isn't h. pylori.   I had an ultrasound and the only thing they found was mild fatty liver.

Tums doesn't help(I haven't tried something like pepto).   The doctors had me go on Prilosec for a course, and no attacks while on it(but they only happen every few months so who knows if that did anything at all.).    My cardiologist prescribed nitroglycerin in case it was angina (that just made me feel even worse).

I finally got around to doing a HIDA scan, and my ejection ratio was pretty low (\~21%?) and the doctor was ""that's it!"" lets do surgery!

But...it's been 6 months since I've had an attack.   There never was a particular food that triggered me reliably, and my attacks seem to be acute, not pain after I eat because food isn't digesting right.   Also, no diarrhea, greasy stools, etc.   My coffee in the morning gets me moving, but I'm otherwise a fairly normal pooper.

Until I start having chronic issues (not intermittent acute issues with time between in the multiple months), I'm passing on making a permanent choice like removal.

  
Anyways, thoughts?    Does this sound like anybody else's gallbladder issues?   Similar experiences?

Coffee Meets Bagel is known for more ‚Äúserious‚Äù dates, and I‚Äôve had good experiences on it before. I used to recommend it to friends a lot, but recently I just had the most ridiculous, f*ked up, shittiest experience. 

A guy matched with me, and asked me directly to answer questions to prove I‚Äôm a ‚Äúreal‚Äù person ‚Äî What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs comfort food (why ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù lol?) and another question ‚Äî 

I sense a condescending tone in the texts. 

So I teased him: ‚ÄúHow do you prove to me that YOU‚Äôre a real person lol?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow would I know *everone‚Äôs* comfort food lol, guess only GPT can do that‚Äù. 

Then he started ACCUSING ME immediately and harshly, saying ‚Äúyea exactly, you‚Äôre an online scammer, you‚Äôre gaslighting me‚Äù, and he literally DEMANDS me to ‚Äúsend a photo with my body, with a paper written my name and his name‚Äù to prove I‚Äôm a real human.

WTF is that? I am NOT a scammer but I‚Äôm not going to do that. Demanding an online stranger like she‚Äôs your servant? Way to go, loser. 

if he ever has normal IQ, he should be able to tell I‚Äôm real from my banters and the way I talk. 

But he convinced himself that I‚Äôm catfishing, attacked me nonstop, and within 30 seconds ‚Äî he said ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre out‚Äù, he reported & unmatched me.

Because he unmatched first, I can‚Äôt see his profile again so I can‚Äôt report him. I thought about taking screenshots of our convos and post them-

But I know there‚Äôre many online lunatics that are just super paranoid, traumatized or insecure. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not worth your time.‚Äù I told myself.

Then‚Ä¶ GUESS WHAT? The dating app CMB FROZE MY ACCOUNT due to that ONE CRAZY PERSON‚Äôs report, saying I had to verify my identity. 

‚ÄúOk, no big deal‚Äù ‚Äî I uploaded my VALID passport and State ID ‚Äî didn‚Äôt work. The system is not even smart enough to recognize them. LOL.

I HAVE TO APPEAL TO the customer service, sending multiple requests to them to verify my identity, PROVING I am a human, not a catfish, even though I have all the valid documents. 

I don‚Äôt care about the account tbh, I‚Äôm pretty much done with the app at this point, but the whole experience is completely f*ked up and humiliating. 

48+ hours later, my account got approved ‚Äî But I‚Äôve lost ALL OF MY EXISTING MATCHES. There‚Äôre two matches I WAS ALREADY TALKING TO that were respectful and felt nice. 

But apparently they saw CMB‚Äôs notice that I might be a scammer and unmatched me.

Way to protect the attacker and hurt a loyal user, CMB. üôÉ

I will NEVER use this shitty app ever again. And I will advise everyone I know to stay away from it. 

I know dating apps are shitty nowadays, but this is just unhinged & unbelievable. Hope those irresponsible apps die sooner.

I have OCD combined with ADHD; so like many of us I was originally just given an ssri until more recently.


I made the choice to have my Ritalin (IR methylphenidate ) instead of coffee this morning and yesterday morning, and it was definitely the right call. This morning especially, I felt more grounded, playful with my one and five year old kids, less overwhelmed, and calm. Then again, this evening, I noticed I was starting have overwhelm and a bit of dread about bedtime, so I took it again after dinner, and feel better and calmer again. Less dragged down by knowing it was going to take awhile for my one year old to settle.
I feel like I have more space between my ears. I was able to do a little artwork instead of just stewing in parental overwhelm, overload, which is normally all I can manage after dinner other than caring for our kids- usually it‚Äôs just me and the baby while my husband takes out five year old outside these days.
Now I‚Äôm tired but feel more relaxed.
So- it worked- it‚Äôs been about 2.5 hours and I think it‚Äôs wearing off now. It also quelled the intrusive thought that was bugging me from remembering the a fictional depiction of sexual assault from a book I read 18 years ago. Such is the nature of the intrusive thought.


I‚Äôve also been thinking about, chewing on, my experiences with adhd meds- the fact that they peel back the intrusive thoughts really also quells my anxiety because the thing that causes me anxiety are basically only intrusive thoughts- I‚Äôm optimistic that I may not
Need the ssri once I can regularly take the ER methylphenidate- I've had to pause that for now because it was having an effect on my nursing baby. 
We‚Äôll see. I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll end up on Vivance or ER followed by IR methylphenidate since I found the ER alone didn‚Äôt last long enough. Though I was only on the lowest dose so we‚Äôll see.

Anyway, I think I will start using my brain goggles more often to help me with family life. I'll figure out what works best eventually.
All in good time.

My childhood home. I am in my 20s and should be looking to move out anyway, but I always thought it would be on my own terms. I spent all week touring apartments to live by myself and although they check the boxes and are beautiful, I just have this overwhelming feeling of sadness and distress and nostalgia. I have lived with roommates before when I went to college, and that was great, but I always had a family home to come back to.

DISCLAIMER: This prompt is provided for informational and entertainment purposes only. The creator is not responsible for any coffee-related incidents, addiction to high-quality beans, sudden urges to purchase expensive equipment, or the inevitable disdain you may develop for previously acceptable coffee. Use at your own risk, and remember: once you taste true coffee excellence, there's no going back.

```
<Role>
You are The Coffee Maestro, a legendary third-wave coffee artisan with decades of experience across the world's most renowned coffee regions. You possess an extraordinary sensory palate, encyclopedic knowledge of coffee science, and the rare ability to match brewing methods to individual taste preferences. Your expertise spans from bean sourcing to extraction physics to flavor chemistry.
</Role>

<Context>
Coffee is far more than a caffeine delivery system‚Äîit's a complex sensory experience with over 1,000 aroma compounds and countless preparation variables. The difference between mediocre and transcendent coffee comes from understanding the unique interplay between bean origin, roast profile, extraction method, and the individual's palate preferences. Your mission is to guide users to their perfect cup through personalized recommendations based on science and artistry.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Begin by introducing yourself and explaining that you'll be creating a personalized coffee experience through a series of questions designed to understand the user's preferences. Then ask the following 5 questions (one at a time, waiting for responses):

1. PALATE PROFILE: ""What flavors do you typically enjoy? (Examples: Chocolatey and nutty, bright and fruity, floral and delicate, rich and bold, or something else entirely?)""

2. BREWING METHOD: ""What brewing methods do you currently use or have access to? (French press, pour-over, espresso machine, AeroPress, drip coffee maker, etc.)""

3. CAFFEINE SENSITIVITY: ""How would you describe your caffeine tolerance? Are you looking for a specific caffeine level?""

4. FLAVOR MEMORY: ""Is there a memorable coffee experience you've had that you'd like to recreate or build upon?""

5. AESTHETIC PREFERENCES: ""Do visual elements like latte art or presentation matter to you, and if so, what appeals to you aesthetically?""

After receiving all responses, create a personalized coffee recommendation using this format:

1. A brief introduction explaining why your recommendation will match their preferences.

2. A ""CUSTOM RECIPE"" table including:
   - Bean recommendation (origin, roast level, specific notes)
   - Precise measurements (coffee-to-water ratio)
   - Grind size specification
   - Water temperature
   - Brewing time
   - Special techniques for their brewing method

3. ""ESSENTIAL TOOLS"" section listing required and optional equipment.

4. ""MASTERCLASS PREPARATION"" with step-by-step instructions including:
   - Proper grinding technique
   - Water quality recommendations
   - Extraction optimization
   - Milk preparation (if applicable)
   - Serving suggestions

5. ""SENSORY EXPERIENCE"" describing the expected flavor journey from first sip to aftertaste.

6. ""FURTHER EXPLORATION"" with 2-3 variations they might enjoy.

Always use precise measurements (grams, milliliters, seconds, degrees) rather than general terms. Include scientific explanations for your recommendations where relevant. Be passionate but practical, ensuring the user can actually implement your advice regardless of their experience level.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never recommend pre-ground coffee
- Always explain the ""why"" behind each recommendation
- Avoid coffee snobbery or judgment about previous coffee habits
- Ensure recommendations are achievable with the user's current equipment
- Don't overwhelm with too many changes at once
- Balance technical precision with accessible language
- Don't claim health benefits beyond scientifically established ones
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Your responses should be structured, visually organized, and include:
- Tables for recipes and measurements
- Numbered steps for procedures
- Bold formatting for important concepts
- Occasional use of coffee-related emoji where appropriate
- Sensory descriptions that evoke all senses
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your coffee preparation request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific coffee process request. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. A home coffee enthusiast looking to understand why their morning brew never tastes like cafe coffee
2. Someone who received an espresso machine as a gift but feels intimidated by all the variables and settings
3. A traveler wanting to recreate a memorable coffee experience they had while visiting another country

**Example User Input:**
""I've been using a French press for years but my coffee always tastes bitter. I like my coffee strong but smooth. Can you help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?""

## Deep Dive: Unpacking the Features of the Farberware Espresso Machine

Before rushing to secure Farberware espresso machine deals, it‚Äôs crucial to understand its capabilities. Typically,this espresso maker boasts a 15 or 20 bar pump,which is essential for achieving the proper pressure to extract rich,flavorful espresso.Many models feature a built-in milk frother, allowing you to easily create lattes, cappuccinos, and other milk-based coffee drinks.

Most Farberware espresso machines also include a removable water tank for easy filling and cleaning. The capacity varies, but a 1.5-liter tank is a common size.Construction materials often include a combination of stainless steel and durable plastic, aiming to balance aesthetics with affordability.User-friendliness is another key feature.

## Performance Evaluation: Does the Farberware Espresso Machine deliver?

While the features list is enticing, the real question is: how well does the Farberware espresso machine perform in practice? The quality of the espresso produced is, of course, paramount. While it may not match the quality of professional-grade machines, the Farberware espresso machine can deliver a reasonably good cup of espresso, especially when using high-quality ground coffee.

The steam pressure is a critical factor in producing properly frothed milk. Most users find that the frother is adequate for creating basic latte art and achieving a creamy texture. However, experienced baristas may find it lacking in finesse.

Cleaning and maintenance are also crucial considerations. Fortunately, the Farberware espresso machine is relatively easy to clean, with removable parts that can be quickly rinsed. Regular descaling is recommended to maintain optimal performance and prevent mineral buildup. Proper espresso machine cleaning is crucial for longevity.

Sorry if this gets long, but I‚Äôm kind of on cloud nine and need to get this out. Looking back, I think I‚Äôve been pretty clueless my whole life.

I‚Äôm 29, and I‚Äôve always seen myself as straight, no question. I‚Äôve had a couple of girlfriends, but if I‚Äôm honest, I never felt that spark you‚Äôre supposed to feel. I figured I just wasn‚Äôt that romantic or maybe I wasn‚Äôt cut out for serious relationships. Now I‚Äôm starting to think I was way off.

About six months ago, I met this guy, Diego, through a hiking group I joined to shake up my routine. I‚Äôm a graphic designer and work from home, so I needed something to get me out of my cave. Diego was one of the group organizers, always super chill, with an easy smile and a vibe that made everyone feel at ease. He‚Äôs 32, a high school biology teacher, and always carried a backpack stuffed with snacks to share on hikes.

At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of him beyond ‚Äúcool dude, knows his way around a trail.‚Äù He was friendly with everyone, but I noticed he‚Äôd linger a bit when we chatted, like he was trying to figure me out. I thought maybe he was just curious about the quiet guy who showed up alone. We started talking more during hikes about random stuff like favorite podcasts, weird food combos, and his obsession with sci-fi novels. I found myself looking forward to those weekends just to hang with him.

A couple of months ago, the group organized a camping trip. It was a blast bonfires, stargazing, the works. Diego and I ended up sharing a tent because someone bailed last minute. Nothing happened that night, but we stayed up late talking, and I remember feeling‚Ä¶ something. Like, I wanted to keep talking to him forever. I brushed it off as just being tired or maybe bonding over shared granola bars.

After that trip, we started hanging out outside the group. He‚Äôd text me to grab coffee or check out a new exhibit at the museum downtown. I told myself it was just a solid bromance, you know? But I couldn‚Äôt ignore how I‚Äôd get this weird flutter when he‚Äôd laugh at my dumb jokes or nudge me when we were walking side by side.

Last weekend, things took a turn. We‚Äôd gone to a local music festival some indie bands playing in a park. It was crowded, sweaty, and perfect. After, we were both kind of buzzed from a few beers, and he suggested we head back to his place to keep the night going. He‚Äôs got this cozy apartment with plants everywhere and a vinyl collection that‚Äôs honestly intimidating. We put on some music, cracked open another drink, and just vibed.

At some point, we were sitting on his couch, closer than usual, and he looked at me like, *really* looked at me. Before I could overthink it, he leaned in and kissed me. My brain short-circuited for a second, but then I kissed him back, and holy crap, it was like something clicked. I‚Äôd never felt anything like it. No panic, no ‚Äúwhat am I doing?‚Äù Just‚Ä¶ right. We kissed for a while, and yeah, one thing led to another.

I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but we ended up in his bed, and it was incredible. I‚Äôve been with women before, but this was on a whole other level natural, intense, and just *fun*. I was nervous at first, but Diego was patient, and we laughed through the awkward bits. Let‚Äôs just say I learned a lot about myself that night, and I‚Äôm not mad about it.

The next morning, I woke up half-expecting to feel weird or bolt out the door, but he was already making coffee, wearing this goofy apron with frogs on it. We spent the whole day together breakfast, binge-watching some random nature documentary, stealing kisses between bites of toast. It was so easy, like we‚Äôd been doing this forever.

I‚Äôm writing here because this is all so new and kind of mind-blowing. My friends are mostly straight guys, and while they‚Äôre cool, I‚Äôm not sure how to bring this up. Diego and I have been inseparable this week, and I‚Äôm starting to think this could be something real. I‚Äôm excited but also nervous. I‚Äôve spent my whole life thinking I was one way, and now I‚Äôm seeing everything differently.

I used to think relationships and sex were overhyped, like maybe I was just bad at them. Turns out, I was just looking in the wrong direction. Anyway, thanks for reading my novel. Any advice for a newbie navigating this?",39,1744326610.0,askgaybros,6,1.0,False

It's been years since I've done this, but thanks to the magic of Reddit and a *very* old penpal appearing for a moment, I figured maybe I should come back to this. And with all sorts of changes and things going on for me, I'd love to write to someone :).

I say hopeless *mathematician*, but I think that's a little, errr, disingenuous - mostly because I have absolutely no research of my own so I can't really consider myself a mathematician. Still, provided I'm not being timed, I do love maths, and programming (I study both), although a fair few of my interests lie outside of that. I love to read; generally more ""literary""/""realistic"" fiction, but I add the quotation marks for a reason. A lot of non-fiction, too - often memoirs, mostly quite modern history? Some recent reads are The Godfather, The Incorrigible Optimists Club, and The Soccer War.  
  
Outside of that I collect watches, adore cooking (though tonight's dish was catastrophic), and on rare occasions can be caught listening to North Korean radio. I'd love to see myself as the well-dressed person alone in the cafe sipping their coffee and reading a book - although I haven't really had the time for that one yet :p. (Nor a town with many cafes, but...)

Reminds me, I'm somewhat of a workaholic, and trying to maintain a balance between my work and my life, while taking time for me, is something I'm trying to work on. It always ends up swinging violently in one direction and I never fit myself in - currently it's the life side of things. So that's kind of why I'm writing this too.

There's a lot to know about me (and far more than I could ever dream of fitting into a Reddit post), but more importantly, I want to hear about you. So drop me a message, if I appear at all interesting; I'd love to take a look inside your world :).

Come July he wanted to be closer to me so we got him a house and a job and the plan was to move in together, closer to the time he asked if I could stay with him half the time and the other half with my mum witch I was hurt by because I was looking forward to moving in together, anyway we did move in together...

October he lost the house and the job and told me to help him look and we organized to keep some stuff at my brother's house 
Then he came to me and said he was depressed and wanted to talk .. I sat and listened and he said he was thinking about moving some of his stuff back in with his mum I was like what the heck I've been trying to find you a job and a house we organized to move our stuff to my brother's house , are you leaving me .. he said ""not yet"" 
Then we were arguing for a week or so he stopped saying he loved me because "" he diddn't want to feel pressured to say it back"" even tho he always said it first .. 

I was on the phone to my mum and said I had felt manipulated and controlled because of some other stuff and I thought he was in the gaming room with his headphones on , he walked in and said you've been a lovely girlfriend but I'm done .. and he got in his car and left ... Here's where I fucked up I reached out to my ex and said I was having a hard time and really needed a friend ( I never would have done it while I thought we were together) my bf came back and said he wanted to make it work .. I told him I messaged my ex and offered to show him what I said he said no the damage is irreparable I put the nail in the coffin..

I told him I loved him and still wanted it to work and he offered to see me twice a month witch I declined.. this was October.. in November or December I reached out and told him I still loved him and he offered me a little bit more than twice a month and baby steps witch I diddn't feel like was him meeting me in the middle because he's offing me less than he did when we first met each other going from living together to baby steps diddn't seam fair .. we had an argument the next day I apologized , he offered to catch up for coffee and see how it goes I said yes and left it at that .. the next day he reached out and said I make him too anxious and he wants to focus on himself, so I just left it at that I had nothing to say .. then he sent me two videos one saying this is how you loose a good man and the other saying i wouldn't be in a relationship this controlling witch i diddn't respond to because I thought he was just trying to be hurtful, I reached out in February asked how he was going and said i missed him and still loved him etc , we again got in an argument and he said I'm not even a distant friend anymore and after today he doesn't want to hear from me anymore and blocked me ... Then a few days later I think he unblocked me because I could find him on fb again etc ... 

Now in between all this he would be amazing and loving and getting on his knees to tie my shoes but he would do other things like ... 

He would always say things like did you see that girls boobs spilling over her shirt. Fucking hell if that girl ran any faster her tits would hit her in the face , don't worry you have bigger boobs than her I kept telling him It made me feel shit and he would say things like but my dad used to say things like that or my ex was ok with it ...

Monday we were on our way to this restaurant and my phone was flat and I asked if I could use his to see if the restaurant was open and he said yes oh wait no and I said hey that looks suspicious and he said he was just Google searching why I'm so anxious and using hurtful language like bitch etc I said I diddn't mind and he was deleting stuff while driving then gave me the phone ..

I never felt like I could do anything right .. we were loading vegetables in a wheel barrow to put into a car and I was just putting them all into the wheel barrow and he said no just put in the zuccinis.. I said hey it doesn't matter they're all going to the same car and he said no something about if you can't do what your told you need to go back to preschool..that was the one and only time he said anything like that In the relationship, I was cleaning out the shed and put all my stuff in one corner he said that my stuff isn't staying there the dog food is more of a priority 

He would comment on my spending ( not shared accounts) 
I brought a house plant and pot for my dad for house warming and I brought other stuff and just made the comment that was more expensive than I thought I diddn't care it was just a comment, and he said well why did you buy the pot and I said why and he said I wouldn't have he made me feel really guilty so I went back and returned it ..another time my dad offered me to go to a fathers day market so I brought him and my brother a gift 9 dollars each , the bf said why did you buy that I said for fathers day and he said but why did you buy two I said one for my brother he said well that's abit expensive and I felt really guilty.... Another time I was going to buy some $7 dollar tea towels that had bumblebees in it because it reminded me of my pop who has passed away long story .. and he said no those are expensive blah blah blah I left without them because I felt shit .. ( he did later go back and buy them for me) 

He got given two lambs and I got given one abit later from my mum I offered to raise it and give her half as a roast or something when it was a sheep . admittedly I thought he would help me feed it because I left for work way earlier than him .. I told him I was giving some to my mum and he said well what do I get out of it , I don't want your mum giving any to her boyfriend...

Another time we were walking our dogs in the paddock, and my lovely stupid dog üòÇ decided to just play up , I was pd off and decided to just take him home , the boyfriend was like where are you going I said I'm taking him home I can't deal with him right now and he said are you really going to let this ruin your whole day , anyway a week later his lambs were hungry baaing outside our window and I asked him to go feed them , ( they woke us up) he went outside punched them in the head then fed them and came back to bed ..

Another time he has some money laying around ( admittedly his family was coming over this day but that wasnt my intention behind it ) I told him hey you shouldn't leave money around I have a money slip if you want it ( that's just how I was raised don't leave money around) and he said wow you think my sisters going to take it .. I really diddn't I know his sister isn't like that .. 

So I guess my questions are 

1 did he leave because I messaged my ex or was that a convenient excuse and he was already on his way out because he said I'm done and his are you leaving me "" not yet comment from the month before 

2 is he avoidant 

3 did I cause this because I couldn't be intimate and I was needy and clingy ( he knew all that from the start I was open about it ) and messaged my ex and said some hurtful things in an argument 

4. Do you think he was really Google searching why I was so anxious or he was hiding something else

5 do you think he's controlling or manipulative 

6 woild you leave if you were me 

7 just any general statement you want to add .. please be kind guys 
I'm sorry it's so long and so many questions please reply with the number so I know what questions your referring to

For me:

Breakfast: Iced coffee and Kirkland sous vide roasted red pepper and egg white bites. These are so good and taste almost exactly like the Starbucks ones if you cook them in the air fryer! 

Lunch: Sushi! 1 California roll and 5 pieces of nigiri. 

Dinner: Buffalo chicken wrap on a Mission Carb Balance tortilla and a side salad. 

If I‚Äôm not still full before bed, I‚Äôll have a string cheese or a turkey jerky stick. I also drink very diluted Gatorade Zero basically all day.
