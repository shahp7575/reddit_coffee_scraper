1lwjych,https://i.redd.it/3fmjucgy83cf1.png,He Broke My Heart. Now His Body will Pay the Price,"# Chapter 1

My brother had hated me for seven years.

The last time we argued, I stormed out during a downpour, furious and reckless. I ended up falling into a river, and when I woke up, my memory was a mess.

At the hospital, he looked relieved—like a weight had finally been lifted. He pointed casually at a terminally ill patient and said, ""That's your real brother.

""Get it straight. Don't bother me again.""

The pale-faced man walked over, gently stroked my head, and said softly, ""Come on, I'll take you home.""

After that, I went to great lengths to save this so-called ""brother."" I braved a snowstorm to find a specialist, stayed up countless nights to watch over him.

I even risked my own life for him.

Then, one day, my real brother stood in the freezing snow and blocked my path, his voice shaking in panic.

""You really… don't remember me?""

The doctors had warned of memory confusion. I'd just woken up in the hospital.

Falling from such a height into the river had given me a severe concussion. I'd been in a coma for over two weeks.

Two weeks ago, I had a huge fight with my brother, Charley Lyons.

Right before slamming the door behind me, I shouted, ""I'd rather die than have you clean up after me!""

His face twisted in fury, and behind me I heard his cold, mocking laugh.

""Then I hope you get your wish.""

But now, two weeks had passed—and I was still alive.

When I opened my eyes, the soft winter sunlight streamed through the hospital window.

It took a while for my vision to clear, and then I started to hear things.

Outside the room, I could make out the voices of the doctor and Charley.

""Trauma to the head, extended coma—

""memory loss or confusion is very likely,"" the doctor said.

""It's not just about forgetting friends and family. In some cases, they forget who they are entirely…""

I forced myself out of bed, wanting to explain that my memory was fine.

I hated hospitals.

I didn't want this diagnosis to become another reason to keep me trapped here.

Just as I reached the door, I heard Charley's low voice.

There was something in it—cold, yes, but also strangely pleased.

""This might actually be for the best,"" he said.

As if trying to prove the doctor's point, he added, ""She woke up briefly last night, looked at me, and asked who I was.""

He wasn't lying. I vaguely remembered that moment.

But I'd only asked because I wasn't fully conscious, and everything had been a blur—I couldn't even make out his face.

My hand froze on the doorknob.

The doctor tried to offer reassurance.

""There's no need to jump to conclusions. We'll know more once your sister wakes up.

""And even if there is memory loss, we can work on recovery…""

But Charley cut him off.

""No. It's better if she forgets. Don't try to bring it back.""

I could even hear the trace of joy he didn't bother to hide.

So that's what he really wanted? For me to forget him?

After everything… after all the fights since Mom and Dad passed… he's the only family I have left.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

But now that I'd survived, I just wanted one more chance to talk to him.

I pulled open the door.

Our eyes met—his filled with surprise, then quickly turning cold and distant.

I'd been unconscious too long.

When I spoke, my voice was hoarse, ""I actually…""

Charley's brows knit together, disbelief flashing across his face.

But then, almost like trying to convince himself, he made up his mind.

He assumed I was confused—mistaking someone else for him.

In the hallway, people came and went, oblivious.

It was like he couldn't wait to get rid of me. Without even looking, Charley reached out, pointed randomly at a patient walking by, and said, ""That's your brother.""

For a moment, I thought I must have misheard him.

I stared at him, stunned. ""What?""

Something flickered in his eyes—hesitation, maybe even guilt—but it vanished almost instantly.

We'd been siblings for over twenty years.

No matter how much he hated or resented me, I couldn't believe he'd push me toward a total stranger while I was still bruised, broken, and barely back on my feet.

Right then, I thought—maybe we really needed to talk. Really talk.

I opened my mouth, ready to put the bitterness behind me.

But he cut in again, his tone sharp and final, ""I said, that's your brother.

""Don't call the wrong person again. And stop coming to me.""

This time, he'd made up his mind.

When he motioned again to the man who had stopped nearby, his face showed no trace of doubt—just cold determination.

The doctor had already slipped away, probably not wanting to get involved.

People flowed through the hallway, slowing down to glance at me—curious, uncomfortable.

To them, I probably looked like a girl who'd gone off the deep end after nearly drowning—so out of it I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

The man Charley pointed to stood quietly across the hall, leaning against the wall.

Tall, well-built, with striking features—but pale. Deathly pale.

Anyone else would've been angry to be dragged into something like this.

But he wasn't. He simply looked at Charley, then at me. Calm. Silent.

Like he was waiting to see what would happen next.

Charley spoke again, voice colder than ever, ""I'm just a friend of your brother's. I came to check in out of politeness.

""If you want to talk to him, go find him yourself. Whether he accepts you or not—that's up to you two.""

And with that, he turned and walked down the hall, never looking back.

My hand, hanging at my side, started to tremble.

I kept telling myself—it's fine. He's hated me for years. This shouldn't be a surprise.

So what if I lost a brother who never wanted me? It's not like we ever really got along anyway.

But my eyes still burned, and I couldn't stop the tears from rising.

Shock. Shame. Anger. Frustration.

The emotions crashed into each other until I couldn't even form a single word.

I watched him walk away, the world tilting slightly as I grabbed the doorframe to steady myself.

A loud ringing filled my ears. For a long time, I couldn't pull myself back together.

Then, the man who had been silently watching finally moved.

He let go of the wall and slowly walked toward me.

For a second, I thought he might come over and scold me—accuse me of faking, of making a scene.

Now that Charley had left, I was the only one left to blame.

I instinctively tried to take a step back.

But maybe I'd been in bed too long. Maybe my emotions had drained every last bit of strength.

My body didn't move.

Then, before I could even process what was happening—

A hand gently landed on my head.

At first, it felt almost like a scolding tap—but there was no force behind it.

Just a soft, almost tentative touch. A pat.

It was a long moment before he finally spoke.

His voice was tired, but gentle. ""Come on. Let's go. I'll take you home.""

How many years had it been since Charley last called himself my brother?

Too long. So long I'd forgotten what it felt like.

I looked up at him, dazed.

We'd been fighting for years.

Ever since our parents died.

Maybe I really had gone crazy.

Because I stared at this complete stranger—a man I'd never seen before in my life—and still, I nodded.

""Okay.""

# Chapter 2

I followed a stranger back to a home I'd never seen before.

The place was spotless—so clean, it felt cold. Lifeless.

Not a speck of dust anywhere. No signs of anyone actually living there.

It reminded me of him—his pale, expressionless face. Too still. Too quiet.

Years ago, a place like this might've scared me. But now, life or death didn't matter much to me anymore. There was nothing left that I'm afraid of.

I glanced around the room. On the coffee table were several small white pill bottles. I recognized them instantly—they were the same kind I'd once tried to collect.

But doctors were always cautious.

No matter what excuse I gave—stress, insomnia, anxiety—they never gave me more than a few at a time.

I'd spent six months saving them up and still barely managed to get a dozen.

Now, looking at all those full bottles, I almost laughed.

And surprisingly, I felt a flicker of envy.

That many pills… more than enough to die.

Next to the bottles sat a photo.

It was strange—black and white, about a foot wide.

The man in the picture looked straight into the camera. Calm. Blank. Completely emotionless.

It stood out so much I couldn't help but stare.

Then I glanced at the man standing beside me—his face practically a mirror of the one in the photo. Same expression. Same stillness.

Even after he saw me notice the pills and the photo, his face didn't change.

Without a word, he calmly walked over, gathered them up, and tucked everything into a drawer.

Then he turned to me and said gently, ""Sit down. I'll make you something to eat.""

So he really believed it. He thought my head was so messed up I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

That thought pulled me back to reality.

Lying to someone already standing on the edge—it didn't sit right with me.

I wanted to tell him the truth. Then leave.

But the image of that photo, those pills… they stayed with me.

And suddenly, I was curious. What had he been through that pushed him so close to the edge? Just like me?

Where did he even get that many pills?

Before I knew it, I'd sat down.

He went into the kitchen. Said he was going to cook. But for a long time, I didn't hear a thing.

I got up and walked to the kitchen door.

He was standing there, staring blankly into the open fridge.

It was as empty as the rest of the apartment.

Not a single ingredient. Not even a bottle of water.

Clearly, no one had cooked here in a long time.

The stovetop was bare—no pots or pans, just a single ceramic jar. The kind used for boiling medicine.

He stood there for a while before finally snapping out of it.

He shut the fridge and turned to look at me.

His voice was soft, almost apologetic. ""Sorry. I forgot to buy groceries. I'll go out and get something.""

Over the years, I'd looked at myself in the mirror and thought, I'm alive, but I don't feel it. Like I've become some hollow soul, floating outside my own body.

But standing there in that kitchen, I realized—

There was someone else out there who looked even more like the dead than I did.

He walked past me and headed toward the door.

And I realized—I couldn't hear his footsteps. Couldn't even hear him breathe.

It suddenly occurred to me—maybe this stranger, someone I'd just met today, wasn't planning on coming back.

Just like that night… after my fight with Charley. When I fell into the river.

Charley and the doctors had both insisted it was an accident—that the rain was too heavy, the bridge too slick.

That I'd slipped.

But I knew better.

He was already at the entryway, hand on the door, just about to step out.

I looked at his back and said, without thinking, ""I like fish.""

He froze.

Stiffened slightly, then slowly turned to face me.

His expression unchanged—calm, pale, unreadable. ""What?"" he asked.

I met his gaze and repeated, ""I said, I want fish.

""For dinner. Can you make that for me?""

The front door was still ajar.

Cold wind blew in—late autumn, almost winter.

It rushed through the apartment, tugging at the hem of his coat and messing up his already disheveled hair.

Against the wind, his face looked even more bloodless. Almost ghost-like.

His fingers, hanging by his side, gave the slightest twitch.

After a long pause, he nodded. ""Okay.""

I watched him walk out. The door clicked shut behind him.

Maybe—just maybe—he'd actually come back.

The thought made me laugh at myself.

I was someone who'd been ready to end it all.

And yet here I was… worrying about whether a stranger might not return.

I sank back into the couch and closed my eyes. The same images came rushing back.

My parents—who should've been alive and well—crushed beneath the rubble.

And me, pulled out alive, surviving by stepping over the lives of the two people who loved me most.

The scene shifted—Charley's face filled with rage, his voice sharp and bitter.

""Erma, you're the one who should've died. That would've been justice.""

""After all these years, do you really sleep with a clear conscience?""

No. I didn't.

That was why I hadn't had a single night of real rest in years.

I slipped into a nightmare again—and it took a while to drag myself back out.

When I opened my eyes, they landed on the closed drawer beneath the coffee table.

My hand moved before I could think. I slid the drawer open, reached inside, and pulled out the pill bottles.

I'd never stolen anything in my life. The moment my fingers closed around one of them, my palms were instantly damp with sweat.

But I'd done my homework. I knew the dosage.

If I took half and left the rest for him—well, that'd be enough for both of us to disappear.

My thoughts were hazy. I told myself this was reasonable. Fair.

My fingers trembled as I unscrewed the cap of the first bottle.

Then, out of nowhere, the phone on the coffee table rang.

The sound tore through the silence like a gunshot.

I jumped, nearly dropping the bottle.

My heart thudded.

Guiltily, I set the pills down and grabbed the phone.

I hit ""Answer"" before realizing—it wasn't mine.

He must've forgotten it when he left.

The call connected.

And immediately, a furious voice exploded through the line.

""Listen to me, Nolan—over 200 million dollars! You really think you can walk away without giving me a dime? Not a chance!

""I might not have raised you, but I sure as hell gave birth to you!

""That little sister of yours died for you—and as your father, I have every right to inherit from a dying son!

""Donate it all? Keep dreaming!""

# Chapter 3

I hadn't meant to listen in on someone's private conversation.

But the voice on the other end of the line had been so loud, so agitated, and so fast that by the time I snapped out of it and hurried to hang up, I'd already heard more than I should have.

A slip of paper had fallen onto the carpet.

It must've come out when I'd fumbled with the drawer earlier, grabbing the pill bottles.

It was a diagnosis report—late-stage heart failure. The patient's name: Nolan Diaz.

The name struck a chord. It was the same one the man on the phone had been shouting about.

I thought for a moment before it came to me—something I'd seen trending not long ago.

Nolan, founder and CEO of Nolan Tech, had suddenly announced plans to sell the company, even though it was booming.

The timing made no sense. Selling now would mean taking a loss.

I remembered the news coverage—reporters swarming him, and him standing there with that same expression he wore now: calm, vacant, lifeless.

He'd said only one thing, ""I'm tired. I just want to rest.""

So it was him.

And the reason he wanted to die… was because he was dying.

Funny, how life worked.

Some people were perfectly healthy and still wanted to die. Others, even with everything going for them, got hit with a terminal diagnosis.

I picked up the paper carefully and tucked it back into the drawer with the pill bottles.

Stealing medication from someone with a terminal illness…

Even if I made it to hell, I'd probably still get spat on by the devil himself.

Outside, dusk was falling, and rain had started to fall in steady sheets.

It beat against the floor-to-ceiling windows, tapping louder and harder as the last traces of daylight disappeared.

Still no sign of him at the door.

He… didn't actually die out there, did he?

I sighed.

After a moment of internal debate, I stood up and stepped outside.

His car was still in the front yard. He must've left on foot.

And without his phone, he wouldn't have been able to call a ride—not until he got out of the neighborhood, anyway.

Maybe he hadn't gone far.

I grabbed an umbrella and headed out, walking through the rain and past the gates of the villa complex.

Then I hailed a cab and asked the driver to take me to the nearest mall.

Honestly, I doubted he was really out buying fish this late.

But I still wanted to look for him.

It was cold, and the mall was quieter than usual. Fewer people than normal.

I checked each floor, scanning every aisle, but didn't see him anywhere.

Just as I was about to give up and try a different mall—

A sharp, cold voice sounded behind me, ""Who told you to follow me here?""

Charley.

I turned around. He was standing not far away, face tight with irritation, staring straight at me.

Standing next to Charley was Elsie Palmer, the daughter of a CEO he'd recently partnered with on a big project.

He'd gone to close a business deal and conveniently picked up a new ""goddaughter"" along the way.

The CEO praised him endlessly—called him warm, generous, kind-hearted. But only I knew the truth. He'd never been the warm-hearted type.

He just didn't like me, his real sister.

It felt like my heart had been dropped in ice water—heavy, aching, and tight.

I'd spent years trying to get used to it.

The brother who used to dote on me, protect me, give in to my every whim...

Had turned into someone who couldn't look at me without disgust. Every word he spoke was sharp, cold, and full of contempt.

And yet, no matter how much time passed, I could never truly get used to it. Never really stop caring.

It took me a moment to push the feelings down.

I tightened my grip on the umbrella, forced myself to meet his eyes, and said as calmly as I could, ""I wasn't following you. I… came to find someone.""

His eyes darkened, voice full of suspicion and anger. ""You've never once come to this part of town.

""If you weren't tailing me, who else would you be looking for?""

Just as he said that, I spotted a familiar figure behind him.

I couldn't clearly remember Nolan's face. It was still a blur in my mind.

But a face that pale, that still, that dead-looking—there couldn't be another one like it.

He was standing at a distance. Not close, but not far either.

He didn't move forward. Just stood there, watching me.

Like he preferred it this way—keeping some space, quietly observing.

Charley frowned when I didn't respond and snapped again, ""I'm talking to you.

""Stop creeping around and following me. I'm not your brother. Get that through your head.""

Nolan stood there holding a plastic bag.

Through the clear plastic, I could see a cleaned, freshly prepared fish inside.

He'd actually bought it. After being gone for over three hours, he really came back—with the fish.

And just like that, a memory surfaced—uninvited.

Years ago, I'd thrown a fit late one night, begging Charley for cake from that bakery on the far side of town.

He'd scolded me, said eating sweets that late would rot my teeth.

Plus, it was way past closing time.

I sulked and went to bed angry. But in the middle of the night, he came back, cold all over, sneaking into my room so our parents wouldn't wake up.

He pulled the cake out from inside his coat—it was still warm.

And with a stern face, he told me, ""This is the last time.""

But somehow… there was always another ""last time.""

I snapped back to reality and looked at the fish again.

Then, unexpectedly, I let out a quiet laugh.

Charley stared at me like he'd just seen a ghost.

He followed my gaze, and when he turned to see Nolan standing there, his face twisted in shock and anger.

""Why the hell is that guy still here?""

I finally pulled my eyes away from the fish and gave him my answer.

""I didn't come for you. I came to find my brother.""",1,1752171414.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

It’s early, but a small group of men and women is gathered on the hot sidewalk outside the Roswell Salvation Army, hugging close to the building’s wall, standing in its small strip of shade. The sun has only been up for two hours, but it's already hot as Hades. Breakfast will be served soon, and the smell of pancakes and grease is moving past us on the dry, desert wind.

I ask around: Has anyone seen Michaela? I haven’t met her, just exchanged texts, so I can’t describe her. People murmur, some shake their heads. But when I do find Michaela Merz sitting at a folding table in the dining room at breakfast, all those same people know her and greet her. “Some people here call me Doc,” she explains as to why they may not know her name. “Or maybe the Toughest Bitch in Town.”

She has a serious face, but she cracks a slight smile.

A man leads the room in a prayer, and the food is served: juices, coffee, pancakes, and some sausage. Some people sit at big round tables chatting and catching up; one man slips bits of bacon to his dog under his seat. Others come and go quickly, silently eating their pancakes and then slipping back into the New Mexico sun.

All the while, Michaela sits attentively at her table in the corner, a large emergency medical supply bag next to her. I can tell she is being careful not to be intrusive, just present. She nods at an older gentleman, moving slowly with a cane. He nods back. She notices a young woman walking slowly, perhaps in pain, and makes eye contact.

Michaela is wearing a dark blue collared shirt that reads “Pecos Valley Public Services” and cargo pants. And that’s why I’ve come to find her today. She’s behind an all-volunteer, community-led EMS service– the first in New Mexico– that embeds itself in the community to provide free medical support to local residents.

When getting their provisional license to operate last fall, Michaela found that the service she wanted to build was foreign, alien even, to the established ways of providing medical care. It was so out-of-the-box that it was almost unclassifiable.

“When I went to register Pecos Valley as an EMS, they asked me, ‘Are you with the city or the state?’ And I said ‘Neither!’ ‘Ah,’ they said, ‘so you are for-profit?’ No– we aren’t making a profit.’ ‘Oh, so you will do Medicaid? And I said, no, just free.”

I just moved back to the US for college and it's my first time dating in the US. I got Hinge and Tinder. Made my profile, had the initial crazy waves of interest and then picked the ones I actually vibed with. Then I deleted the apps cause it was really overwhelming (especially tinder lmaoo😭too many people imo). 

My dating history
I have been with one guy before he was the, we broke up six weeks ago because we're going to different colleges and my parents just moved so we don't live in the same city anymore. 

The situation
So in the last five days I've been on four first dates. Each date was between 4-6 hours long😭(idk if that's even normal lol) mostly like a mix of lunch or coffee an activity or two, talking a lot and coming back to my place and hanging out (and one ended in a makeout session). 

They're all super cool people in their own means ways but I feel no spark😭. With none of them. Albeit some of them were pretty... interesting to say the least but I mean. 

Idk if the dates were too long, and maybe I'm being overly judgy but there'd be times I'd say in my head where I'm like.. yeah I'm not interested in this person. But idk I didn't have it in me to leave the date and then it almost always got better. But also idk what my dating style is. With my ex I was a slow burner with like four weeks of talking before I even thought of him in that way and then after I was hot for a good two weeks of like intense love and stuff before we started dated. But the difference here is for all four of them we talked on the apps for a bit before I planned anything. And they were cool and it's been ""romantic/sexual"" conversations mostly not platonic. 

But idk I just don't feel it. Idk if there's smth wrong w me or if none of them are my ""person"". Should I stick it out and go on second dates or should I redownload the apps and keep looking? Or just give up lol idk? 

Bonus: anyone in a long-term committed gay relationship able to attest to being a slow burner?",1,1752171216.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

About me:  
30F, single, remote job. After 13 years in 5 cities (including abroad), I’ve loved each place for what it gave me - career, growth, fun, adventure. Now I’m looking for more community, stability, and the potential for partnership/family.

I’m very active but not intense: into running, road biking, fitness classes, sports leagues, long walks, small hikes, and sunshine. I enjoy surfing and snowboarding, but realistically, if I lived near slopes I'd go only a few times a season. I love reading in parks or coffee shops, and value being able to walk to a gym or grocery store.

After years in very transient places, I’m craving a community where it’s easier to build long-term friendships and date people who are a bit rooted. I love cities with transplants and understand some turnover is inevitable... I’d just love to meet people who plan to stick around for a while. Also, I’m hoping to avoid long, gloomy winters - I grew up in the Midwest, and months without sun really wore on me.

What I’m looking for:

* Active, community-minded lifestyle
* Outdoors/fitness access without being extreme
* Good dating pool for women in their 30s
* Walkable neighborhoods
* Sun > gloom; warmth > cold, but not too extreme
* Somewhere people put down roots

What’s your experience in Denver? I hear great outdoors, but also possibly transient.

Raleigh/Durham? Does it have the energy to meet people and enough sunshine?

Other places I should consider?

Thanks in advance - I’d love your honest takes or hidden gems ❤️",1,1752171147.0,SameGrassButGreener,1,1.0,False

My peers mostly looked up to me for how my hands drew such beautiful canvases. Everyone thought I would pursuing fine arts for college, however, I chose to pursue BS medical laboratory sciences (my parent's decision mostly contributed to this choice.) 

A few months ago, one of the peers who used to look up to me in highschool and apparently took alot of inspiration in my passion won a 100k philippine pesos from a government creative youth contest - painting category. At that time I was so happy for her, that I busted to tears when she thanked me how much I inspired her without even talking to her. I was so grateful. 

Now that I'm in my room, laying blankly at the ceiling after drinking one cup of caffeine (i only drink coffee like once a month) my thoughts are swirling. I feel so envious. What if I never quit art? Would I have achieved something like that? Being in a allied health program strips my whole identity. I can't wear this and that, i cant do this and that, i have to keep my hair color black, i dont have time for my passion, all i do is study study study. 

I feel like shit. So shit. Im so jealous. All my potential, my passion, all long gone. I feel so broken and lost. I want to be highschool girl again, painting canvas. I feel like i couldve achieved alot as an artist...but i had to quit...to focus at studying.. i feel like shit..

I wasn't turning down the street I grew up on. I wasn't standing near the large oak in the front yard of the house where I'd lost all my baby teeth. I wasn't sitting inside the kitchen, where, on my fifteenth birthday, I accidentally dropped the cake my mom had baked, which made my family laugh so hard that we shed tears. No. I was holding an oil painting at a Goodwill on the other side of the country.

""That can't be possible,"" my husband said.

""It can be possible, Parker, because I'm holding the flipping painting and telling you.""

""One, language. Two, can I say something without you jumping down my throat?"" Parker asked, his voice even.

""Yes,"" I said.

""Is there an outside chance that this just looks like your childhood home? I mean, you grew up in the burbs. A lot of cookie-cutter homes, no?""

I hated to admit he had a point. But as I stared at the house, I couldn't come around to that line of thinking. This was my house. Hell, the roses in the flower beds were the same size and color as I remembered them. ""No. I mean, I hear you and you're not off base. But, dude, this is my house."" I pointed at the porch. ""I broke that railing trying to do a ballet spin and fell into the bushes.""

""You? Miss Two Left Feet? Senorita Trips-a-lot? Tried to do a ballet spin?""

""To be fair, I did the spin. I just didn't stick the landing.""

""A minor detail in the world of dance. The landing part.""

""I landed…on the bushes right here,"" I said, pointing to the painting. ""Hold on, I have to send a photo to my mom.""

""Does she have old house photos?""

""Of course she does. You've met her, right?""

I had Parker hold the painting and snapped a few pictures. I sent them over to Mom and asked if she had a photo to compare it to. The message came back a minute later. ""OMG! That's our house! Weird."" Another ding brought us a house photo. It looked exactly like the artwork in my hand.

I showed Parker. ""Christ,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""Told you.""

""That's wild. Is it a print or a real painting?""

I ran my hand across the art. There was a palpable texture to the brush strokes. Sometimes, a print may have varnish applied to give the impression of brushstrokes. This wasn't that. ""I think this is real, but let me check something else,"" I said, walking toward the wall of ugly lamps.

I turned on a lamp and held the painting in front of the bulb. Some artists will draw the picture first in pencil before painting. Sometimes, you can see those marks when you hold it up to the light. Staring at the oak tree in the painting, I saw graphite streaks underneath.

""It's real,"" I declared.

""Who painted it?""

A slash of red paint in the corner mimicked a signature, but Parker and I stared at it as if it were written in Minoan Linear A. Parker traced the paint with his finger. Forwards and backwards. ""The first name may be George or Jeff? I think George. Look at how it flows."" He retraced the letters, and it made sense to me.

""Okay, what's the last name?""

""Hell if I know.""

I tried Parker's finger tracing. It felt like I was tracing a line drawing by someone with too much caffeine in their system. These didn't seem like actual letters.

""Might be Moffit,"" a soft voice said from behind us.

We turned and saw that a Goodwill employee had materialized. She was a short, frail-looking elderly woman with a hairstyle that resembled a well-constructed cumulus cloud in both color and shape.

""Moffit?"" I said.

""I think that's an 'm',"" she said, pointing to two humps. ""Then it kind of circles into an 'o' and the double fs. The 'I' and the 't' are somewhat stylized, I think. Artists being artists.""

I looked and, yeah, it kinda looked like Moffit. ""I can see it. George Moffit, you think?""

""I do. Beautiful piece. Don't you think?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""It looks exactly like the house I grew up in."" I showed her the photo my mom sent.

""How strange!""

""Right? I grew up across the country. Why is this even here?""

""When I was younger, there was a company that would paint your home for you.""

""Painters?"" Parker deadpanned.

""Ignore him,"" I said. ""He doesn't know how to act in public.""

She laughed. ""I understand. I have one just like him at home. That's why he's at home.""

I laughed. ""You're teaching and I'm taking notes, ma'am.""

""Anyway, they would come paint portraits of your house. It was a thing for a few years. This looks like one of those. There may be a company name on the back, under the frame.""

I flipped the painting over and gingerly removed the frame. Sure enough, there was a small, faded sticker that read ""Cozy Home Portraits Company."" There wasn't any other information. I made an impressed noise. ""Look at that. Have a jumping off point to find out what this is all about. Thank you so much….""

""Marge.""

""Marge, thank you. Sorry again for this guy.""

""Marge, please forgive me. You're a gentlewoman and a scholar.""

Marge leaned into him and nodded at me. ""You're punching above your weight with her, kiddo. Keep her happy.""

Parker laughed, wrapped his arm around my hip, and pulled me in for a hug. ""Marge, that's the best advice I've ever received from a Goodwill employee.""

""If only your barber had given you good advice. You could've avoided that haircut.""

I burst out laughing. Parker did too. ""Marge, I hope to grow up to be just like you.""

""You found a guy who can take a joke. That's a start. You guys wanna get that or still debating?""

I looked at Parker, and he nodded. ""How can we not get this? Even if it's just for the story.""

Marge smiled. ""See, you can learn. Come on, kids. I'll ring you up.""

When I got home, I immediately began researching the Cozy Home Portraits Company. I had a hard time finding anything. Most of the search results were links to people on Reddit asking the same questions. Apparently, there were a lot of folks like me who were surprised to find their childhood homes immortalized on canvas. One commenter said something that stuck with me.

""Parker, listen to this,"" I said, reading the post. ""My mom says she remembers someone approaching her and asking if they could take a photo so they could paint the house later. She told them no at first, but they said they'd do it for no cost. Mom agreed and assumed she'd get the painting at some point, but she never heard from the company again.""

""What's the next commenter say?""

""This sounds fake,"" I read. ""Kind of a dickish response, no?""

""It's Reddit,"" he said, shrugging. ""Maybe they just used the houses for inspiration and sold the paintings to commercial houses for reproductions?""

""Then why bother involving the homeowners at all?""

""Maybe to assuage their worries of someone standing outside their home snapping photos of their house?"" Parker suggested.

""I mean, anyone could take a photo of our house, and I'd have no idea unless I saw them do it.""

""True. It's weird, I'll grant you, but I think I'm on the right track. Commercial art. Americana stuff. That was to be it.""

He may have been onto something, but that answer didn't feel right. I couldn't work out the logic. If this company had been around for a while and painted portraits of homes all across the country for commercial sale, why wasn't there any record of them? No stories online. No official business records. No known CEO or lists of artists or anyone. Hell, even searching for the name George Moffit didn't yield results.

My mind told me there was something off about this. A sense of dread loomed over the whole thing. I let it marinate all day to see if I'd reconsider. Shocking no one, I didn't. I told Parker as much as we got ready for bed.

""You're reacting that way because of what's happening in the world right now,"" Parker said, yawning. ""There are real evil people out there, but they aren't painting pictures.""

""Hitler painted pictures,"" I said.

He gave me a deadpan stare. ""You know what I mean.""

""I just can't let it go. It's odd. Odd that it was done at all. Odd that it traveled all the way out here. Odd that I found it. Odd stacked on odd stack on odd.""

""Turtles all the way down.""

""What?"" I said, crinkling up my face. ""What do turtles have to do with anything?""

He laughed. ""Nothing. Just a dumb expression."" He yawned again. ""Why is this bothering you so much?""

""Some random company painted and sold pictures of my childhood house with no one knowing about it. It's….""

""Odd,"" he said with a smile.

""Very. It's just not sitting right with me.""

Parker yawned for a third time. ""My melatonin is kicking in here. Get some rest and see how you feel in the morning. Maybe call your mom, see if she has a story to tell. She might know something.""

He didn't wait for my response. Instead, he rolled over, shut off the lamp, and turned on our sound machine. As digital thunderstorms rolled into our bedroom, I lay down on my pillows but didn't fall asleep. This whole thing smothered my thoughts as much as my weighted blanket did my body.

I would call Mom tomorrow. See what she knew. If anything. I heard light snores coming from Parker's direction and sighed. That man could fall asleep even if the house were on fire. I flipped on YouTube, found something to help me sleep, and closed my eyes.

Or would have, if I hadn't seen our front porch light turn on.

A cold touched my brain and froze the rest of my body. The light going off didn't mean a prowler was trying to jimmy open our lock. It could be a bug flying too close to the sensor or a sleepwalking squirrel. Improbable? Sure, but they were better than the alternative. I didn't want to wake Parker, but I also wasn't keen on investigating alone.

While I was debating getting out of bed, I heard a noise in the kitchen. That made the decision easy. I elbowed Parker. ""What?"" he asked, his voice a blend of exhaustion and annoyance.

""Our front porch light went off,"" I whispered.

""Raccoons tripping the light,"" he said. ""Not worth waking me.""

""I know, but…but I heard someone in the kitchen.""

His eyes zinged open. In a flash, he was on his feet and grabbed the bat we kept near the bed. He quietly inched along the wall until he got to the bedroom doorway. He peeked out and scanned the room before turning back to me and shrugging.

I pointed to the kitchen again before popping up and joining him on the wall. Parker wasn't pleased. He told me, not in words but vigorous nods, to go back to the bed and wait. I didn't. He gave in, and we made our way out of the bedroom. Me walking directly behind him like some backwards waltz.

I saw nothing. That went double after Parker slammed his hand on the switch, flooding the room with light and damn near blinding me in the process. I let out a painful yelp and covered my eyes to adjust. I heard Parker sigh.

""We're good,"" he said. ""Nothing in here.""

""You gotta tell me before you do that,"" I said, finally checking out the room. Everything initially looked washed out. ""I'm nearly blind.""

""I wanted the element of surprise,"" Parker said.

""You achieved it,"" I said. ""All I see now are a bunch of little diamonds everywhere.""

He walked into the kitchen. ""Your intruder is nothing more than a fallen salt shaker,"" he said, holding up the culprit.

""Oh.""

""Like I said, a raccoon probably tripped the light. I'm going back to sleep. You should, too.""

He walked past me, patted my ass, and headed back to bed. I was about to join him when my eyes landed on the painting. I walked over to it and stared. In the store, looking at it had flooded my emotions with joy and happiness. But now? None of that.

Unease seeped into my blood and rushed through my body. Something was different about the painting. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed, but I knew something had. It was giving me chills. I grabbed a nearby napkin and draped it over the artwork like a coroner covering a dead body. My thinking was that if there was something supernatural about this thing, the napkin would keep it at bay.

Dumb, I know, but it made sense at the time.

""I couldn't believe that picture. That's so wild."" Mom was too chipper for this early in the morning. She always was, though. A real 'rise with the early bird' kind of gal.

That wasn't me. I still had bedhead as I sipped my cup of coffee. Parker, another early riser, cooked breakfast. ""I thought so too. Someone told me a company used to go around and paint pictures of homes. They'd ask the homeowners beforehand. Any memory of that?""

""Not that I can remember. Back then, it was mostly your father who spoke with salesmen. I found them unseemly. I can't imagine he'd allow someone to do that, rest his soul.""

""Yeah. Dad was pretty private.""

""We had a neighbor who was a painter, though. Carl, no, that wasn't it. Craig! Craig…aww goddamn my ancient brain. Bonnie, don't get old. It's hell.""

""I'm trying not to. It's why I do my nightly skincare routine.""

""It's intense,"" Parker added with a smirk.

""What was his name? It's been years since I thought of him. Craig…Morris? Something like that. He didn't live near us for long. Dad didn't like him. At all.""

""Why?""

""Craig was the human equivalent of a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. Irritating. He rubbed your father the wrong way.""

""I don't remember Dad talking about him.""

""He didn't around you, but with me, hoo boy. Craig used to walk by the house all the time, always whistling 'pop goes the weasel' for some reason. He'd stand too close when he talked to you. He'd leer at me when I was outside hanging laundry on the line. He'd never get the hint that I wanted to be left alone, even though I was always short with him. Especially after he said that you were growing up nicely.""

""Gross,"" I said. ""I was ten.""

""Like I said, he was a weirdo. But, again, most artiste types are, I suppose. Remember your Uncle Walter? Made those ghastly papier mache skulls. They used to be all over his house. Was like walking into some cannibal's hut whenever we'd go over there. But he was good at making them. Who'd want them is another thing altogether. He gave us one, and I made your dad keep it in a bag in the garage. 'Don't bring that ghoulish shit in my house.'""

As my mom rambled about skull shapes like a Victorian phrenologist, a thought came to me. I looked down at the painting and traced the painter's name. ""Mom, could his name have been Craig Moffit?""

Parker looked over at me. I nodded down at the painting and traced what I thought the letters were with my finger. He hit his forehead with the spatula and shook his head.

""OH MY GOD! Yes! That was it! Craig Moffit. God, what a blast from the past. He really was a weird little freak of a man,"" my mom said, laughing. ""He used to wear these tiny little shorts, and he did *not* have the legs for it. Looked like two toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Mom droned on a little longer, but provided nothing of substance beyond Craig Moffit's horrid legs. But she'd given me some new information - the artist's real name. As soon as I hung up, I grabbed my laptop.

""Craig Moffit! Not George! Craig!""

""I see it now,"" Parker said. ""We should've never trusted Marge. Didn't like the cut of her jib.""

""Babe, her jib was flawless,"" I said, turning to the painting. ""Her eyes, not so much.""

""To be fair, we all agreed it was George Moffit….""

""There! There's Craig Moffit!"" I turned the computer around and showed a webpage dedicated to his art. Parker leaned down to get a closer look.

""His legs do look like toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Rolling my eyes, I turned the laptop back to me and clicked on the man's ""About Me"" page. It was illuminating. Craig had quite the little career. He'd worked for a few newspaper outlets. A few magazines. Some ad campaigns. His stuff was good. There was a list of known works.

""There are a few house paintings listed here. It has to be him.""

""Has anyone mentioned how odd this is?"" Parker said with a sly smile.

""It's catching on.""

""Maybe he saw your home as a happy family home and wanted to capture it for that company. Is there a contact page?""

""There is!"" I yelped. I read the page out loud. ""If you have questions about Craig or his work, please feel free to reach out here,"" I said.

""That's great. You can email him and ask directly.""

""Moffit estate at Moffit art dot com,"" I read. ""Shit. He's dead.""

""That shouldn't matter. Maybe the guy who runs the estate can answer your questions?""

I nodded. It was worth a shot. I started composing a message, and Parker went back to breakfast. I glanced at the artwork on the table next to me. Something about it picked at my brain.

""Hey, I meant to ask, have you been watching professional Wiffle ball games on our YouTube?""

""Oh, yeah. I've started turning on games after your melatonin kicks in. Puts me right out.""

""Uh-huh. Are you a Wiffle ball fan?""

""No,"" I said, laughing. ""I just happened across it one night, and I fell asleep like ten minutes into a game. It's better than ocean waves. Which game was it?""

""Umm, Rhinos against the….""

""Storks? Oh man, those two teams hate each other. Storks have won the last three series behind Dustin Braddock's nasty banana ball…."" I stopped speaking because I could feel Parker's smug smirk on his face. I looked up and caught it with my own eyes. ""Not a fan.""

""What the hell is a banana ball?""

PING!

""They emailed back already,"" I said. ""What the hell?""

""Maybe there isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate?""

""Hi, Craig Moffit was my father. He did several pieces of local homes during that era. I would love to discuss this with you. Can we set up a call?""

""So there clearly isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate,"" Parker said.

""I'm going to say yes. I think I have to, if for no other reason than my own sanity.""

""Go for it. I can be there for the call if you need me.""

So I set up a call with the estate for later that day. Hopefully, there'd be some information that I could use to stop the itch in my brain. Parker served me breakfast before he got ready to head out to the gym.

""You never told me what a banana ball is,"" he said, placing the plate in front of me.

""It's a side arm slurve. A strikeout pitch. Nearly unhittable if Braddock is on his game."" Parker gave me a quizzical look. I sighed. ""Not a fan.""

After Parker had left for the gym, I went back over to the painting. It was still sitting in the last place I had left it. Still had the napkin over it. The bad vibes I felt earlier were still there. In fact, they'd grown worse. I didn't even want this thing in my house anymore - covered or not.

Despite my misgivings, I pulled the napkin off the painting and gave it a once-over. I felt my stomach gurgle, and my throat went dry. Looking at this now literally caused physical pain. It didn't make sense.

""Where's the front door?"" I suddenly asked myself out loud.

The front door of the house was gone. Blacked out like an actor with perfect teeth coloring in one to look sufficiently destitute for a role. I scraped where the door had been with my thumb. No fresh paint. It was like it had always been that way. But it hadn't. I checked the photo I sent to my mom to confirm.

""What in the….""

There was a creak on the basement stairs. There very much shouldn't have been a creak on the basement stairs. The basement was home to nothing but dust, Christmas decorations, and my ugly childhood couches we didn't have the heart to throw away. Since none of those things can walk, this made no sense.

I tiptoed to the knife block and pulled out a butcher knife. With my phone in my free hand, I used my nimble thumb to unlock it. I was ready to dial 911. But, as I stared at my reflection in the knife blade, I questioned whether I was prepared to stick it into another person. I wouldn't know that until it came to that moment. I very much prayed that wouldn't happen.

Another creak. Near the top of the stairs now. It was getting closer. I flexed the grip on the knife. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't. Turns out all that woo-woo TikTok relaxation breathing stuff was just bullshit. My heart was thumping like an angry jazz drummer's long-awaited solo. I felt sweat drip down my neck.

Something flickered on the painting. It momentarily took my eyes off the basement door. Like last night, I initially registered nothing different. Then I noticed. Through the window of the living room, it looked like someone had turned on a light or lit a fire. Splotches of yellow and orange paint filled the window frame.

The jingling of the basement door handle snapped me out of my trance. My palms were sweaty. My legs swayed like bamboo in a strong breeze. I gathered all my remaining strength and yelled out, ""Hey! St-stay away from me!"" I wanted to say more, but overwhelming fear shut me up.

The jiggling stopped. Relief. My hectoring worked...for about two seconds. The basement door cracked open. There was a ghostly, pale face staring back at me. That was when my brain firmly decided whether I was a fight-or-flight kinda gal.

I was flight.

""Fuck this."" I dropped the knife, which clattered on the tile like that drummer hitting the high-hat, and sprinted toward my front door. I yelled gibberish the entire time, tears streaming down my face, and blasted out of the door. My fingers hit send on the call, and seconds later, an annoyingly even-keeled 911 operator connected me with the police.

Parker returned home before the police arrived. He found me sitting inside my locked car. Before he could crack a joke, he caught sight of my face. I'd been crying and could feel how puffy my eyes were. Consternation crossed his face. I rolled the window down. ""Get in the car.""

He did. I explained everything to him. He was astonished. He was confused. He grabbed my hand and held it steady as I went over everything, pausing occasionally to sob like a child with a skinned knee. When I was done, he asked why I didn't leave right away.

""Who do you think you are, Rambo?""

I laughed. I need that. ""For a few seconds, I was. Then I wasn't. I wasn't even Gizmo pretending to be Rambo.""

He gave my arm a loving squeeze. ""If it'll help you calm down, we can watch some pro Wiffle ball tonight. I hear the Rhinos are playing the Turkeys.""

""Storks,"" I said, ""but they are actually playing the Habaneros tonight. Gil Faust is looking to debut his 'chili ball' pitch.""

He leaned in and kissed my forehead. ""But you're not a fan.""

""I'm not.""

A knock on the window caused me to scream. The cops had arrived. If they were curious why we were sitting in our car, they kept it to themselves. I relayed what happened, and they said they'd go into the basement and check it out.

Fifteen minutes later, they came walking out. ""We didn't see anyone down there,"" the Cop said. ""But, to be fair to you, your basement gave me the heebie-jeebies.""

""Great,"" I said.

""I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth. On the plus side, I haven't seen that love seat since I was a kid.""

""Want it?""

""It's better left to the past. You two have a nice day.""

We watched them leave. Parker turned to me. ""You okay?""

""No, and I won't be until I go into the basement myself.""

""What? Why?""

""I…I can't explain. Something is drawing me there. It sounds crazy, I know, but I feel it in my bones.""

Parker saw the determined look in my eyes. This was going to happen. Had to happen. He sighed. ""Want me to go in first?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""Are you actually going to wait for me to go in or follow right behind me?""

""We both know the answer to that.""

Resuming our reverse waltz, we went back into the house. Once in the kitchen, we stopped near the painting. Parker looked over and agreed that there were changes. We turned our attention to the closed basement door. Parker put his hand on the handle.

""We don't have to go down here, Beth,"" he said. ""The cops didn't find anyone.""

""Alive. If there's a ghost in this house, I need to know. If we know, we can remove it.""

""How?""

""I'm still working on that part,"" I said. ""But I need to know for certain. I won't feel safe otherwise.""

""I'm inclined to just say yes and move on. Something altered the painting already. Who the hell did that?""

""One issue at a time,"" I said.

He knew he couldn't talk his way out of this. He knew I needed this, and he loved me enough to see it through to the end. Even though he was petrified, too. The skin on his arm had goosebumps as soon as we walked into the kitchen. It felt like braille to me now, and the only thing it said was ""let's not do this.""

But that feeling in my brain, the one drawing me down there, wouldn't leave. It was stronger now that we were in the home. Something was loose in my house. I knew it in my heart. Whatever it was, I needed to keep it from roosting in my new home. Let the ghosts live in the past. Leave my future alone.

Parker gripped the handle, sighed so loudly it was heard two towns over, and opened the door. The stairs led down into the dark of the basement. The floor around the landing was the only thing visible. In the abstract, it wasn't anything. Right now, though? Horrifying.

Parker found the light switch, illuminating the rest of the space. So far, so good. We took our time walking down the stairs. Creaking along the wooden one step at a time. Maybe it'd have the same effect on the ghost that hearing creaking steps did on me. Perhaps the phantom was hiding, holding a ghost knife and deciding if it was going to play ghost Rambo or just fearfully disappear into the walls.

""The house in the painting had a basement, too,"" I whispered. ""When I was a kid, I hated going down there. Any time of day. Just didn't feel natural, ya know?""

""Are you trying to get me to stop doing this?""

""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" I said. I kept right on rambling, though. ""What bothered me wasn't so much going down there. What scared me was the trip back up. Turning your back on the dark. I used to walk backwards up the stairs.""

""We can try that in a few minutes,"" Parker whispered back. ""Any other ghost stories you want to share before we hit the landing?""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""It just popped into my mind. I haven't thought about that fear in years. Since we moved away from there, actually.""

""That's not comforting.""

We got to the bottom and took a look around. Everything looked normal. No surprises. Just our old, ugly furniture and friendly Santa decorations smiling and giving us a frozen wave.

I thought about turning and heading back up, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to be down here. I was also positive Parker would be furious if I went darting up the stairs without him. Leaving him alone in Spook Central might be grounds for divorce.

We headed over to the furniture. There was a layer of dust on everything. I smacked the pillow, sending it flying into the air. I coughed and sneezed, instantly regretting my actions. Parker's withering glare told me he wasn't fond of my actions either.

""Sorry.""

""I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, do you?""

""No,"" I said. ""It looks like it always does.""

""Feeling gone? Can we go back upstairs now?""

Before I could answer, we heard the familiar chime from our security system, followed by the calm, reassuring voice informing us that our front door was open.

""What the fuck?"" I said.

""Shhh,"" Parker responded, his finger to his lips. He pointed up to the ceiling. We cocked our ears and concentrated. For about twenty seconds, there was nothing. Silence. It didn't last.

CREAAAAK.

The floorboards wheezed as someone took slow, deliberate steps above us. You could hear the footfalls as they moved from the front door to the hallway. Trembling, Parker pointed up at the ceiling. You could physically see the floor bow ever so slightly from the person's weight. I didn't even think that was possible.

""W-what do we do?"" I whispered.

""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""Maybe they'll leave?""

A second later, we were cloaked in total darkness. All the power in the house had gone out. The only light came from the sunlight streaming in from the open door at the top of the stairs. It wasn't much, but it was a beacon. Our lighthouse. Our way home.

""Let's…,"" is all I was able to say. Someone upstairs ran down the hall, through the kitchen, and to the basement door. They slammed it shut, plunging us into instant midnight.

I wanted to scream. To yell so loud it'd shake the heavens. But I couldn't. My body physically couldn't make that happen. It'd give away our location. I clutched Parker's shirt so hard I was afraid I'd rip it right off him. If it bothered him, he didn't say.

""This sucks,"" Parker mumbled. Understatement of the goddamn century.

""HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!"" One of our Santa decorations started going off. I nearly peed myself at Santa's sudden arrival. I imagined it would've been the same response I would've had if I had seen him as a kid.

Kris Kringle was soon joined by all of our Christmas decorations going off at once. Dozens of laughing Santas, lights flickering off and on, inflatables rising like zombified plastic bags. The noise was deafening, but strangely festive. The strobing lights in the pitch black caused afterimages to dance in my rods and cones. I slammed them shut and silently prayed for this all to end.

Someone must've heard because, as quickly as they'd come to life, they stopped.

We stood in the dark, not breathing. Not moving. Neither of us knew what to do. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this. I couldn't shake the idea that whatever was coming would be worse than what we'd already experienced.

There was a creaking again and a sudden rushing of blinding sunlight from the top of the stairs. Someone had opened the door. Before we could get a glimpse, the door slammed shut, and something sprinted down the now-dark stairs.

I pulled Parker back onto the old love seat. We sat on the edge and kept our heads on a swivel, even though the basement was too dark to see our own hands. We weren't alone anymore.

As my fingertips grazed the couch, I realized something. These were originally my parents. My parents got them when I was living in the house from the painting. They were a physical connection between the past and now. Are these what caused my sudden desire to come to the basement? Was I being manipulated by this thing?

Could I trust myself at all?

That dread feeling I'd had since I brought the painting into our house intensified. I felt it in my bones. Deeper even. My aura. My soul.

I leaned into Parker's ear and whispered an apology. He didn't vocalize a response, but squeezed my arm. I squeezed back. My body shook, and I couldn't get myself to stop. I wanted to run for the stairs, but that old fear came rushing back.

I knew if I ran up those stairs, it'd follow behind me.

Something wooshed by us. My hair flowed with it, trailing behind whatever had sprinted past. I nervously dug my fingers into the fabric. We heard the sound of some liquid splattering on the floor across from us. Water? No. Heavier than water. A sound that made my guts twist soon joined the drips and splashes.

Someone started whistling a familiar tune. Pop goes the weasel. The Christmas decorations flickered on and shut off. In the brief flash of light, we could make out a figure standing across from us.

Craig Moffit.

""POP!"" he screamed as the lights strobed.

""GOES!"" he screamed again, a foot closer this time.

""THE!"" Another foot closer. Almost directly in front of us now.

The lights flickered again, and his face was right next to mine. A sinister smile as he slowly whispered, ""weasel."" I felt something wet and slimy rub against my cheek.

Parker stood and, surprisingly, swung at ghost Craig. It didn't find the ghoul, and, as the darkness returned, his fist only found the arm of the couch. I heard his knuckles crack and him swear in pain.

My ears were the only thing working at that moment, though. I sat frozen, tears streaming down my face. The lights in the house came back on, and I screamed.

On the wall across from us, where we had heard the water, the painting was hanging. Only, it wasn't the old house. It was the current house. All the windows and doors were filled with flames. There were two figures on the front lawn. Parker and I. We were both dead. Standing behind our oak tree, watching it all, was Craig Moffit.

""Parker! Let's go!""

I didn't have to tell him twice. We broke for the stairs and took them three at a time until we reached the top. I grabbed the handle and shoved my shoulder into the door, expecting it to hold firm. It didn't. Parker and I spilled onto our kitchen floor.

I scrambled up and practically yanked Parker into the kitchen. I was about to slam the door when I saw Craig Moffit standing at the bottom of the stairs. We locked eyes. My mind flew back to my childhood. A memory stored deep in the folds of my brain. I was sitting on our porch reading a book and heard that damn whistling.

Craig Moffit. A Polaroid camera in his hands and portrait photos on his mind. I was afraid he'd stop and take a picture of me. I was right. Even now, I could hear the heavy clunk of the shutter and the whirring of the processing photo as it slid out. He shook it, and as the fog of war slowly dissipated on the photo, he smiled.

""This way, I won't forget you.""

I slammed the door shut and urged Parker to grab the car keys. He turned the corner to do so when I heard him sharply yelp in surprise, followed by the squeak of his sneakers on the hardwood and his ass hitting the ground. I ran to him expecting to see Craig, but was stunned by the sight of a living man surrounded by two yellow hulks outside my front door.

Once my brain processed the information, it was clear those men were wearing biohazard suits. It still didn't answer why men in biohazard suits were outside my door. But it cleared up that there were. The suitless man in the middle, though, had a more than striking resemblance to the ghost I'd just seen in my basement. Only younger. Fuller. Fleshy.

""Sorry to startle you both,"" the man said, raising his hands in peace. ""You contacted us about a painting you found. I'm David Moffit. Craig was my father.""

""You've got to be shitting me.""

""We were supposed to talk on the phone,"" I said.

""Yes, but we were worried things might have progressed too much by then. Tell me, has the door in the painting disappeared yet?""

""How did….""

David turned to his men. ""Call for the extraction team."" Turning back to us, he urgently asked, ""Where's the painting?""

""The basement,"" I said. ""But it looks different now.""

""What in hell is going on?"" Parker asked.

""Different? Would you say *violently* different?""

""'Our-dead-bodies-on-the-lawn-and-the-place-ablaze' violently different.""

He nervously turned to where the biohazard-suited men had gone. ""The *experienced* extraction team!""

Parker stood and held my hand. We looked at each other and back at David Moffit. We both cracked. Small smiles that turned into chuckles that turned into a laughing fit. I read somewhere that mental breaks can start like this. Whatever. I leaned in.

""David Moffit, the son of your childhood painter neighbor Craig Moffit, himself a ghost that nearly killed us, is standing in our *fucking* veranda,"" Parker said, barely able to get the words out between screeching laughter. ""I mean, what the fuck is this life?""

Seconds later, a team of armed men in hazmat suits carrying unknown machinery rushed in and headed for the basement. We heard one of them scream, and then the sounds of mechanical engines warming up. David nodded toward the front door.

""We should go outside.""

We did. What the hell else were we going to do? Once we were outside, David pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us one. We both declined. David indulged and nodded back at the house. ""This is the experienced team.""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""I'm going to level with you. What I'm about to say is pretty weird. I like to say weird to people. Sets the right tone.""

""Sir, on what is easily the weirdest day in not only my and my wife's life, but I'd argue humanity's life, nothing you can say will top what we've already been through,"" Parker said. ""I mean, I just discovered my wife watches professional Wiffle ball, for God's sake!""

""Not a fan,"" I mumbled.

""Dad was a strange man. Lots of demons. When he could keep them at bay, he did great work. But that was never for long. Around the time when you were a kid, he got deep into the occult. It was a faddish passing fancy at first, but soon he found a deeper meaning in it. It consumed him. Around this time, well, he conjured a demon.""

""I think I'm having a stroke.""

""He made a deal. We don't exactly know the details, but what we do know is that Dad agreed to start a company that would paint portraits of people's homes. The twist was that the homes he picked would become targets for the demon.""

""Naturally,"" Parker said. ""Because why not?""

""He'd take a photo of the home and give it to the demon. The demon would curse it and insert it into the canvases of my dad's paintings. These photos would be a connection between the subjects in the art and the demon itself. The pull got stronger when the artwork found its way back to the subjects. Then, they'd, well…."" He trailed off.

""Meet each other?"" I said.

""In a manner of speaking, yes.""

So many questions bounced around my brain. This all sounded so outlandish and yet…. The memory of the photo came back to me. ""This way, I won't forget you,"" I said out loud.

Confused, Parker looked at me. ""What?""

""We don't know how many paintings Dad did during this time, but we've recovered sixty-five in locations from New York to California. The people selected seemed to be random…except for you.""

""Why me?""

""My guess? You were neighbors and, well, my dad really didn't like your dad.""

""The feeling was mutual.""

Just then, the extraction team came rushing out. One was limping. The machines they brought looked broken, but the lights were still on. One of them had the painting in a bio-containment bag. It was smoking.

""The experienced team,"" David said, ashing out his smoke on the bottom of his shoe and pocketing the butt. ""Thank you for letting us help rid you of this…menace. The work is exhausting, but my family has to atone for Craig's wicked actions.""

David nodded and turned to leave. I reached out and grabbed his shoulder. ""Wait, that's it? We're free? Just like that.""

""Just like that,"" he said, turning to leave. He stopped and spun on his heels. ""Unless you have something from the old house in your new house. Then you kinda sorta leave a backdoor for the demon to return. So, if you do, I suggest destroying it."" He tipped his cap and left.

Parker and I locked eyes. ""The fucking love seat,"" we said at the same time. My back hurt just thinking about hauling it up those narrow stairs.

Later that night, we torched the sofa in a makeshift fire pit in our backyard. We ate pizza and watched the flames consume the potentially demonic couch. Can't imagine that's a sentence that's been said a lot in history. As we did, relief filled my heart. The dread was gone. I looked over at Parker and smiled.

""I think we can put to bed the argument about who had the weirder childhood, Park.""

He laughed. ""Yeah, summers with my Amish family can't compete with demons."" His phone buzzed. He looked down at the notification with concern. I felt my stomach twist.

""Please tell me it's good news.""

""The Rhinos/Habaneros game is about to start. I set a reminder. Wanna watch?""

I touched my heart and felt pure happiness surge through me. Tears. Grabbing his free hand, I held it tight and gave it a big squeeze. ""I have something to confess,"" I said. ""I think I'm a legitimate fan of professional Wiffle ball.""

""I know, babe. I know.""

We sat together, letting the crackling of a burning demon couch and the crack of a Wiffle ball bat fill the night air. I snuggled into Parker's shoulder. It was warm. Inviting. Home…and not one haunted by an angry ghost.

1lwjs0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lwjs0b/bartovskis_music_box/,Bartovski's Music Box,"Note - For those who prefer an audio version, there is a narration on my youtube channel (https://youtu.be/d7JZyQ6bAmk). Whether you prefer to read or listen, I hope you enjoy!

It was a Sunday when Sarah brought home the music box. She was beaming as she came through the door, weighed down by two bags of trinkets she’d picked up from the flea market.

“Get anything good?” I asked.

She set the bags down on the kitchen counter and pulled out the music box.

I could tell instantly that it was old. Yet it was in immaculate condition. The rich mahogany gleamed under the kitchen lights as she passed the box over.

I almost dropped it, surprised by the weight as she slid it into my hands. I took a closer look. It looked expensive, definitely an antique. The top was carved with intricate patterns and symbols I didn’t recognise, the hinges seemed to be made of gold. It felt cold in my palms.

“So, did we have to take out a second mortgage for this or…” I asked.

Sarah rolled her eyes and gave me a playful shove, knocking over one of the bags she’s set on the counted in the process.

“[Actually, it was free,]()” She replied, picking up the bag and its contents.

“Free?” I was incredulous, something this nice should have cost a fortune.

Sarah explained how the lady at the flea market had inherited a house from her deceased aunt, and they were selling up a bunch of the junk they’d found in the house. How the box gave her a bad vibe and she just wanted it gone.

“[But you’ve not seen the best bit](),” Sarah said, grinning like the cheshire cat as she opened the box.

I watched as the tiny ballerina in the box sprang to life, spinning in an endless pirouette as the box began to play. The music was like nothing I’d ever heard. Beautiful in a haunting way, it was sombre and sad.

I was transfixed by the sound, lost in the flawless music. I glanced at Sarah and saw her staring at the box, a distant look in her eye and a smile on her face. Something about seeing her face like that, it sent a chill down my spine.

Suddenly the music filled me with a sense of foreboding. The beautiful, sad music seemed like a warning.

I looked back at the box. Behind the ballerina, set in the roof of the box was a mirror, and for just a second I thought I was something in the mirror, a flicker of a shadow that didn’t belong. But when I blinked it was gone. I closed the box and the music stopped.

“[Great, right?” ]()Sarah said. her eyes sparkled, full of life as she looked at it. It was one of the many things I loved about her, how she’d get so happy over something most people would think of as mundane.

“Y-yeah,” I reply, putting the box on the kitchen side, not wanting to dampen her enthusiasm.

The next few days went by as usual. We ate, slept and worked. Nothing change other than occasionally I’d come home to Sarah listening the music box, and watching that tiny ballerina spin in front of the mirror.

I avoided it as much as I can. I was so busy with work that it wasn’t hard. I was barely home most days. I can’t deny, the music was incredible. Intoxicating, really. But something about it set me on edge.

It was the next Saturday that I noticed something was quite right. I’d woken early to make us breakfast. I was just plating it up when Sarah came downstairs and sat herself down at the table. She had bags under her eyes and couldn’t stop yawning.

She took a couple small bites of her food then pushed the plate away.

“You feeling ok?” I asked.

She shrugged and smiled before saying. “[Just a little tired]().”

She got up and went into the sitting room. Seconds later I heard the sound of the music box playing. I sighed and tidied up.

We each had plans that day to meet up with some friends, her to visit a spar and I was going to watch some football. It was a sorely needed chance to relax after the week I’d had at work, and it seemed to be just what Sarah needed too. Because when she came home that evening, she had the sparkle back in her eyes and spent the evening filling me in on all the latest about her friends new relationship.

I smiled and nodded along. Not because I really cared about her friend’s dating life but because it made her happy.

By the time we went to bed that night, I’d completely forgotten about the music box and my concerns over Sarah’s obsession with it.

That didn’t stop that melody haunting my dreams that night. I don’t remember the specifics of the dream, but I know that the music box melody was the soundtrack for it, because when I startled awake, I could still hear it playing in my mind.

I sat up in the bed and shook my head to clear it, but even then, I could still hear the music.

“Sarah,” I whispered, reaching a hand towards her. “Do you hear…” I stopped midsentence, my stomach tightening. Sarah’s side of the bed was empty.

I jumped out of bed and opened the bedroom door. The music was clearer now, floating up the stairs from the ground floor.

I crept down the stairs. All the lights were off, but the streetlights from outside spilled into the kitchen, when the music box sat open on the kitchen counter, and Sarah was…dancing.

I froze in the doorway, stunned at what I was seeing. Sarah had never been a dancer. In all the time I’d known her she’d always turned down any opportunity to dance, saying she was too clumsy and had two left feet.

Without wanting to be mean, that was apparent by the way she was moving as she attempted to dance, what I assume was ballet. Her movements were stiff and forced, almost jerky at times.

“Sarah?” I called, not wanting her to think I was spying. “What are you doing?”

She didn’t respond, just kept dancing.

“Sarah?” I stepped closer and it was only then that I noticed, her eyes were closed and they didn’t open once as she twirled around the kitchen.

I waited to see if she’d open them, but she didn’t and it was then that I realised. She was sleep walking. I’d never known her to do that before. I eyed the music box suspiciously. There was something wrong with that thing, I could feel it.

I grabbed my phone off the counter and recorded a short video. I was going to need to have a conversation with Sarah in the morning and wanted to have some proof as she probably wouldn’t remember any of this the next day.   

Video taken, I was tempted to grab Sarah, to hold her and carry her back to bed. But you weren’t meant to wake a sleep walker, were you?

In the end I gently closed the music box, and as the music cut off, Sarah’s movement slowed then stopped, her eyes blinked open, and look of fear crossing her face as she looked around the kitchen.

“It’s ok,” I assure her, pulling her tight. “We’ll talk about it in the morning.”

 

We both slept in longer than usual the next day, but once we were downstairs and Sarah had a hot cup of coffee in her hands, I took her through the events of the night before and showed her the video.

To my surprise, she laughed. She thought it was funny.

“[You see now why I don’t dance]().” She said.

I didn’t like her reaction. Something strange was going on here, I didn’t understand how she couldn’t see it and how she could be so blasé about the whole thing. But I think part of it rubbed off on me, because I started to doubt myself. Should I really be that concerned by a bit of sleep walking? Sure she’d never done it before, and sure it was creepy, but maybe it wasn’t worth getting too upset over.

Sarah went up for a shower and I decided to take a closer look at the music box. I traced my finger along it’s carved patterns and symbols.

I picked the box up and carefully turned it over. It was just as heavy as I remembered, so I had to be extra careful not to drop it as I checked all the side and then the bottom. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, but I knew it when I saw it.

A name carved in small letters on the bottom of the box with four numbers beneath. R Bartovski 1796. The name meant nothing to me, neither did the date. I made a mental note to look up them up when I had more time.

I didn’t want to risk Sarah catching me looking up the name online, so I waited until she went to bed that night before pulling out my laptop and searching through google.

After a bit of digging I finally came across the information that I thought was relevant. Roman Bartovski was a prodigious music composer in the 18^(th) century. He was going to be the next Mozart, if not better. But then, he went missing in 1797 under mysterious circumstances. Just one year after the date on the box.

With this all happening so long ago, the information was obviously a little spotty, but the website I found had pieced together what little information there was on the case.

Foul play was suspected at first, but when they police couldn’t find any leads or suspects, the rumours started to grow. Roman, apparently, had a dark side. Neighbours reported that before his disappearance they’d often see him returning home in the dead of night, or hear strange chanting from his house.

They’d put it down to him experimenting with his music at the time, but in light of his disappearance and some of the odd things found in his house, that conclusion soon changed. The belief then became that he was practising some sort of witchcraft.

The rumours grew worse when his niece, having inherited his house, died mysteriously two years later. Her husband came home late one evening and she found her dead in the basement. No wounds, no injury, just dead; like the life had suddenly been sucked out of her.

 Some said Roman had opened a gate to hell in that house, and his poor niece had been its latest victim.

I sighed, I don’t know what I’d been hoping to find, but that information did nothing to help my sense of unease. No closer to answers, I put my laptop away and joined Sarah in bed.

The music haunted my dreams again that night. I was walking though an old mansion, and, as is often the case with dreams, I had no memory of how I’d got there. The music floated through the dark hallways. I followed the sound as it wound me through the mansion, to a set of steps leading down to the basement.

I didn’t want to go down there. The music was louder now, and the flickering candle light at the foot of the stairs made the shadows dance like they were alive. And yet, I found myself creeping down the stairs, one slow footstep after the other.

There was another sound now. Someone crying. A mournful wail almost drowned out by the music. I turned the corner and saw the music box sat in the middle of the floor, a pentagram painted in red around it.

In the corner of the room stood a cage. A woman lay curled in the corner, her emaciated body covered by a thin white gown. She stared into the room, her unblinking eyes seemingly devoid of life as that hopeless wail came from her dried, cracked lips.

I stepped into the room, and picked up the music box, ready to smash it. The music was unbearably loud now. That’s when I saw him, a dark figure in the corner, more shadow than man.

I couldn’t see his face but I knew he was watching, I could feel his laughter fill my mind; taunting me. And then the ground was shifting beneath my feet. The floor within the pentagram collapsed, a fiery glow surrounding me as I fell into the portal to hell.

I jerked awake, my sheets soaked in sweat.

I could still hear the music in my head. The song wouldn’t leave me alone. I felt like I was losing my mind, but I had to do something about it.

Checking Sarah was soundly asleep next to me, I snuck from the bedroom, tiptoeing around the creaky floorboards to avoid waking her.

The music box was still sat on the kitchen counter where Sarah left it, gleaming ominously in the moonlight shining through the kitchen window.

I grabbed the box off the side, again amazed by the weight of it, and crept out the back door. The shed in the garden was a spider breeding ground, held up by the sheer number of cobwebs as much as by the nails and bolts. It was the one place on the property Sarah would never go.

Honestly I avoided it as much as I could too, but it made it the perfect hiding spot.

The box safely stashed away in a garden pot on the top shelf, I wiped the cobwebs off and slunk back into the house as quietly as possible. I’m sure it was my imagination, but the house seemed lighter already. Warmer, quieter.

I slept soundly for the rest of that night.

When I woke, Sarah was already up.

I yawned and stretched, feeling pleased with myself but a little guilty. Undoubtedly Sarah would be looking for the box soon, if she hadn’t already, and I’d have to pretend I hadn’t seen it. But still, it had to be done, didn’t it?

My good mood lasted until I opened bedroom door and that haunting music met my ear. How the hell was it back in the house?

I walked down the stairs, bracing myself for the accusations and running over scenarios in my head. She must have seen me last night. There was no other way she could have known where I’d hidden it.

Sarah was sat at the kitchen table, an untouched piece of toast going cold on the plate in front of her.

She didn’t look up when I walked in, didn’t take her eyes off that music box.

I grabbed a cup of coffee, waiting for the telling off I was sure was coming my way, but it never did. After a few tense minutes, I crossed the room and closed the music box. Sarah looked up at me questioningly.

“Sorry,” I said, “I’ve got a headache.”

Sarah nodded and stood up, her eyes distant as she threw the uneaten toast in the bin and loaded the plate into the dishwasher, like she as running on autopilot. It was then that I noticed the cobweb in her hair.

The Sarah I knew would never have gone into that shed to get the box, and it was even odder that she never acknowledged it.

I managed to get us out of the house for the rest of the day, and it seemed to wake her up a little. The usual fun, bubbly Sarah surfacing for a fun day shopping, eating and a drink at the local pub. I tried to talk to her about the music box again, but everytime I mentioned it she brushed it off. Never once did she give any indication that she knew I’d hidden it.

That was probably the last normal day I had with Sarah.

Over the next few nights, I had that same dream. I trapsed through that old mansion, not wanting to but unable not to follow the music. Each time there would be someone else in the cage, one night a young man, then next a little girl. They all looked on the verge of death, their gaunt faces staring at nothing. Some cried, some screamed, but none ever acknowledge my presence. Only the shadowy figure.

It was the third night when I woke from the dream to find Sarah wasn’t in the bed. With a knot in my stomach, I slipped out of bed and crept to the door. As I’d feared, I could hear the music drifting up the stair.

I walked down the stairs, no longer taking care to be quiet.

As expected, I found Sarah in the kitchen, dancing in the moonlight, her eyes closed while she spun like the ballerina in the box. But unlike last time, her moves weren’t jerky and unnatural. This wasn’t the clumsy, endearing movements of my wife. This was something else.

I watched as she glided around the kitchen, each move smooth and graceful, her pirouettes tight and controlled, like she’d been dancing for years.

I knew then I had to do something more drastic than just hiding the box. It had to go, because whatever evil was in that box. It was taking control of Sarah.

But first I had to wake her up. I crossed the kitchen to the box and closed the music box, but just as the lid was closing, I saw him. The dark figure lurking in the corner, a dark stain against the wall, barely visible in the faint moonlight.

I froze, but as the box clicked shut, the figure was gone. With the music off, Sarah slowly began to wake.

Again, she wasn’t concerned that she’d been sleep dancing, and I didn’t push the issue. I knew by now she wasn’t going to take my concerns seriously. She was clearly under the influence of this thing. It was on me to save her from it.

I took her back to the bedroom and waited until she fell asleep, then slunk back out of the room and down the stairs, using the torch on my phone to avoid turning on any lights.

The shadows twisted around me, almost as if they were alive as I descended the stairs and entered the kitchen. My heart lurched into my throat at each tiny noise. I kept expecting to see him again, the shadowy figure from my dreams, but I saw nothing.

The box was even heavier than I remembered as I pulled it off the kitchen side and snuck out the door. It may have been my imagination, but as I held that cursed box, I swear I could hear that laughter in my head again.

I threw the box into the passenger seat and started the car. I was worried the engine might wake Sarah, but if it did, I’d just have to deal with that when I got back. I wasn’t going to leave that box in our house for another night.

I drove to the nearest lake, about 20 minutes away. The car park sat empty, no one else was stupid or desperate enough to be out this late.

I followed the trail from the carpark, jumping at every little noise, until I reached the pier. I dropped the box into the murky water at the end of the pier. It hit the water with surprisingly little splash considering how much it weighed.

I felt good as drove home. Like a weight had been lifted. But as I got closer to the house I started to feel the guilt returning. Sarah really loved that music box. She was going to be pissed when she found out what I’d done, and I couldn’t blame her if she was. I’d be pissed if she did it to something I loved.

I told myself it had to be done. That there was something evil attached to that box. It was for her own good. Still, I felt guilty, and I knew I’d struggle to sleep when I got home.

So I sat on my laptop and did another internet search for Roman Bartovski and music boxes. When that search ultimately turned up nothing, I turned to the combined wisdom, or lack thereof, of Reddit. I kept the details in my post vague. I just asked if anyone knew anything about the music box.

I didn’t expect a response, but it was worth a shot.

I’m not sure why, maybe I was just putting off going to bed, knowing the guilt would make it hard to sleep, but I pulled up the video I had of Sarah. The one of her sleep dancing that first time night.

I watched the uncoordinated dance, the jerky, almost puppet-like movements, and that was when I saw it. A shadowy figure, lurking in the background, half hidden in dark hallway. He was only in the video for a second, less maybe, but I knew it was the same figure I’d seen earlier that night. The same figure I’d been seeing in my dreams. Bartovski.

I rewatched that clip countless times. There was no doubting it, he was there. It defied all logic, it made no sense. It completely obliterated my world view, but I I knew then I’d made the right choice getting rid of the box.

When I finally went to bed, I had a dreamless sleep. I should have woke feeling good. I’d done what was needed to protect my wife and home. But I woke to the haunting melody of the music box drifting up the stair to taunt me.

I dashed down the stairs, my stomach sinking further with each step as the music grew clearer.

There it was, sat on the kitchen table in a small puddle. The music box looked completely unaffected by its midnight swim.

Sarah doesn’t even look up when I enter the room. If she did she would have seen the panic and confusion on my face. In that moment I couldn’t have acted normal if I wanted too. I thought I was going to be sick.

But Sarah was transfixed by the box, she couldn’t take her eyes off it. She looked even thinner now, almost gaunt, and her eyes were bloodshot.

A sudden rage filled me. I grabbed the box off the table and launched it at the wall. It collided with a dull thud, leaving a small hole in the wall. The music abruptly shutting off as the lid slammed shut, but it didn’t shatter like I’d hoped. It didn’t even have a  scratch.

Sarah didn’t react. She didn’t get angry or ask why I’d done that. She didn’t even blink. She just sat there, staring at the puddle of lake water on the table where the box had been sat.

I stormed out of the room, my mind racing. I quickly threw on some clothes and went for a run, needing to clear the adrenalin out of my system, and hoping the fresh air might help me think clearer.

When I returned home twenty minutes later, I never was very good at running, the music box was playing again. The music seemed heavy somehow, it hung in the air, forcing its way into my ears and gnawing at my mind.

I grit my teeth and went into the kitchen. Sarah hadn’t moved an inch, but the music box was back on the kitchen table.

I closed the box and the music shut off.

After getting us both changed, I guided Sarah to the car and strapped her in. She didn’t resist. She moved where ever I moved her, completely pliable and compliant, but she would do nothing for herself.

We had to wait on the emergency room for 3 hours before we were seen by a doctor. Obviously I didn’t tell them everything, just that she’d been feeling unwell the last week and took a turn for the worse this morning.

The doctors were confused, but didn’t seem to be as worried as I was. They ran some tests before sending us home, promising the results in a couple of days, and me to make sure she ate and got plenty of rest.

I left feeling disheartened. I don’t know what I was expecting the doctors to say. I knew the cause of condition wasn’t anything natural, but I’d had to try something. And maybe the results would give some insight in how to help her, if we could just get through the next few days.

I put Sarah to bed, making sure she ate something before I left her to sleep. She didn’t resist, but she didn’t help either. She didn’t do much of anything. It was a surprise when I put the food to her mouth and she began to chew on her own.

Once she’d eaten and was laying down, I booted up my laptop. I checked reddit, and to my surprise, I had a message.

It was from an anonymous user. All it said was:

“If you have the box, get rid of it as soon as you can. Destroy it if you can. I can’t explain it, but that music box is evil. I don’t know how, but I know it killed my mum. Good luck.”

I reread the message four, maybe five times, then sat just staring at the screen. I wasn’t sure what I was meant to be feeling in that moment. Some sort of vindication that I hadn’t made it all up? Relief that it wasn’t just in my head? Maybe I felt a little of those, but to be honest, I just felt more scared.

The message hadn’t really offered any practical advice I could use. I’d already tried to get rid of the box, but somehow it just came back. It’d thrown it against the wall and it hadn’t so much as made a dent.

I could try other ways to destroy it. A sledge hammer, or maybe fire. Yeah, I liked the sound of burning that box to ashes.

But if I was going to do this, I needed to do it right. I messaged the reddit user back, asking if they could help me destroy the box. I didn’t really expect them to help, or even reply, but I was desperate.

I spent the next couple hours browsing occult websites, searching for any information I could find on how to destroy cursed objects, stop evil spirits, and perform exorcism rituals. I didn’t expect to need the last one, but….you never know.

The information I found was a mix of fictional stereotypes, to the down right peculiar.

In the end, I settled on a combination things to try. First I’d need a few supplies, but I didn’t like the idea of leaving Sarah alone.

I peeked in through the bedroom door. She seemed to be asleep, and I really needed these supplies if I was going to do this.

I’m never was into religion, but given what I’d seen the last week, I couldn’t deny there were things out there beyond my understanding. The various instructions I’d found online had called for holy oil, blessed salt, holy water and prayers. Who was I to argue? That meant my first stop was a church.

My plan was to take the box to an isolated area and then surround it in a salt circle like I was a Winchester. The I’d douse it in holy oil, and burn it until it was nothing but ash, then I’d use the holy water to extinguish the embers, all while reciting lines from the bible. I’d printed out the relevant pages.

If all that failed, I was going to smash it with my sledge hammer.

It took a while to find a church with a priest that was willing to take me seriously and help me get my hands on the items I needed. Then I had to stop at the hardware store to pick up the hammer.

By the time I got home, darkness had fallen.

My stomach tightened as I pulled into the driveway. Something was wrong, I could feel it.

I rushed into the house, needing to see Sarah was ok, and left everything I’d picked up in the car.

I could hear the music box playing before I had the front door open, but nothing could have prepared me for the scene I found in the kitchen.

Sarah stood in the middle of the room, her wrists held by a shadowy figure.

“Get away from her!” I yelled, rushing at the figure. I dove at him, slamming my should at his side. I passed straight through him, colliding painfully with a kitchen cupboard instead.

I spun around as Bartovski’s deep laughter filled the room.

I looked up at him from the floor. I was closer now, I should have been able to make out his features, but….he had none. No matter how close I looked, he was just a silhouette. Yet somehow he had hold of Sarah.

Her face was contorted in pain, her eyes scrunched tight. I could see the life draining out of her, her skin growing pale.

“No,” I sobbed, and in that moment I made a decision. I couldn’t live in a world without Sarah, I wouldn’t. “Take…take me instead. Let her go.”

Bartovski turned his featureless face towards me. He studied me for a moment. Then, without warning, he let go of Sarah’s wrists. She crumpled to the floor.

Bartovski held out his hand towards me. Waiting.

I stared at Sarah. The slight rise and fall of her chest told me she was still alive. My offer had been accepted.

“I love you,” I whispered to her, and without looking I took Bartovski’s hand.

I felt an intense pain in my chest, followed by a sensation I can’t adequately describe. It was like I was being pulled forward, yet I wasn’t moving.

The room grew dimmer, until there was nothing but darkness. My life for Sarah’s I thought as the darkness took me. That was a good trade.

I didn’t lose consciousness like I’d expected too. I just floated in an endless void.

Is this death?  I thought to myself. It didn’t feel right.

Eventually I became aware I wasn’t alone in the darkness. There were others around me. They stood staring blankly ahead. I called to them but they didn’t respond. They didn’t even react.

I don’t know how long I stayed in that darkness. Time lost all meaning, it could have been days. I didn’t get hungry, I didn’t get tired. I tried to sleep anyway but found myself unable. I could feel my mind begin to fray at the edges. I suddenly understood the stupor of the people around me. How long had they been trapped here? How long had I?

 

 

Then suddenly, light appeared. It was blinding in its abruptness, and I found myself standing in my kitchen again. Sarah sat at the table, her red eyes unfocused as tears rolled down her cheeks. The music box sat open on the table in front of her, the ballerina spinning it’s never ending dance as the music filled the kitchen.

It was different this time. A subtle shift, but that music was so ingrained in my mind now that I noticed it immediately. There was something familiar about the changes to the music. There was something in it now, something that felt intimately familiar. Something that felt like…me.

Sarah seemed to notice it too. She sat up a little straighter, her eyes focusing on the music box.

“John?” She whispered to the box, her eye brows knotting in confusion as she tried to shake off the fog and figure out the impossible.

The impossible fact that I was somehow in the music. The dark figure, Roman Bartovski, the genius composer involved in some dark arts, had somehow taken me. My soul, my essence, and condensed it down, manipulated it, trapped it in the music box, and somehow composed me into his melody.

I heard laughter from behind me. Sarah didn’t react to the sound, and I didn’t need to turn around to know what I’d see. I did anyway, and there he was, Bartovski, his form a shadow in the kitchen, a dark smudge, a blemish on the world.

Behind him stood the others. Men and women, the old and the young. All the people Bartovski had trapped in his music box over the last 2 centuries. Most stood still, staring at the music box, the light in their eyes faded to nothing. Broken.

One woman sat on the floor, legs curled into the foetal position and rocked back and forth, her straggly grey hair hanging over her face. She hummed to herself but didn’t look up.

I turned back to Sarah who was still transfixed by the music box and its melody of souls and a chill ran down my spine.

I turned to Bartovski. “We had a deal. Me for her.”

I reached for her, to try to warn her, but my hand just passed through.

That laughter filled my head again and I knew it was futile. I’d been tricked. I’d traded my soul for hers, and now there was nothing to stop him taking her anyway.

 I watched, tears in my eyes as Sarah eventually closed the music box. When she did, the world turned back to black, and I was once again lost in the void that would be my home forever.

At least I’d be reunited with Sarah soon.",1,1752170999.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

i was kind of not wanting to bother the staff and the place was pretty busy, so i only observed all of this from kind of far away. there is a la cabra switch recipe on their website and mentioned here, but it's not that, it's a single pour. 

the cup of coffee was excellent, i think mostly b/c of the quality of the beans (kenyan, i forget the specifics), but i am just curious to see if i can replicate the recipe and home and compare it against coffee chronicler's etc.

ProtonVPN’s free version was the first one I used, and honestly, it worked alright for browsing and checking email, but it didn’t feel fast enough for Zoom calls. I switched over to Surfshark’s paid trial just to compare, and the difference was pretty clear, faster, smoother, and I liked the CleanWeb feature. Haven’t had any sketchy behavior since.

It happened last Halloween, and I'm still trying to process it. We clicked almost perfectly. She liked the same stuff I did, etc. and we hung out a couple times. Then she came over to my place to watch a scary movie and things got a little frisky. She straddled me and we kissed. She even bent over and we simulated sex while we were still clothed. Then she asked to see my dick. She touched it but we didn't have sex though and she didn't give me oral/a handjob either. We cuddled for a little bit and talked before she left for the night since it was a weeknight. 

The weeks following, she began to grow more and more distant, making excuses and being non-committal when I asked to hang out. Even cancelling a plan last minute. 

Then over text she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and was still trying to heal from her past relationship. Fair enough, but over the phone she also admitted that she thought I was a fuck boy after showing her my dick even though she asked, and that a tarot reading some time before told her that someone she knew was just trying to get sex out of her. 

I had no idea how I was supposed to defend myself against that and just tried my best to convince her I wasn't just looking for sex. Her mind was pretty made up, so I let it fizzle out.

However, she still sends me instagram reels and one of them said something like ""Send this to someone you want to have a coffee with"". I've never been more confused in my life.

But Don't Say I Didn't Warn You.","**TL;DR: Built an AI prompt that absolutely destroys business ideas using red team methodology. It's like having a team of professional pessimists tear your concept apart so you don't lose your shirt in real life.**

Alright r/entrepreneur, story time.

So I'm scrolling through this sub last week and I see the same pattern over and over:

""Hey guys, what do you think of my app idea?""  
""Thinking about starting a dropshipping business, thoughts?""  
""My SaaS concept - feedback welcome!""

And what happens? Everyone's either super supportive (""Great idea bro, go for it!"") or they give some generic advice about market research.

**But here's what nobody's telling you...**

Your idea probably has fatal flaws you haven't even considered. And being nice about it isn't helping anyone.

I used to work in cybersecurity, and we had this thing called ""red team exercises"" where we'd literally try to break into our own systems to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys did.

**So I thought... why not do this for business ideas?**

I built this insane ChatGPT prompt that basically creates a team of professional idea-killers:

* A penetration tester who finds product flaws
* A ruthless competitor CEO who models market attacks
* A social critic who simulates cancel culture scenarios
* A regulatory officer who finds legal landmines
* A political strategist who weaponizes narratives against you

Their job? Absolutely demolish your business concept from every angle.

**This thing is SAVAGE.**

It doesn't care about your feelings. It doesn't want to encourage you. It wants to find every possible way your idea could fail and score the damage on a 1-5 scale.

I tested it on some ""successful"" business ideas from this sub and... yikes. Found vulnerabilities that would have cost people serious money.

**Example attack vectors it considers:**

* What happens when your main supplier gets bought by your competitor?
* How would your business handle a coordinated social media attack?
* What if regulations change and suddenly your core feature is illegal?
* How easily could someone clone your idea with deeper pockets?

**Real talk - this might hurt your feelings.**

I've had people run their ""million dollar ideas"" through this and come back questioning everything. One guy said it was like ""having your business plan audited by a team of sociopaths.""

But here's the thing... if your idea can't survive this simulation, it definitely can't survive the real world.

**The good news?**

If your concept makes it through this gauntlet, you'll know exactly where your weak points are and how to fix them BEFORE you quit your day job.

Plus, you'll have thought through scenarios that 99% of entrepreneurs never consider until it's too late.

**Want to try it?**

\[Full MVTA prompt would go here - it's long so I'll put it in comments\]

Just remember... I warned you. This thing shows no mercy.

**UPDATE:** Holy crap, RIP my inbox. For everyone asking - yes, this works on any business idea. Yes, it's free. No, I'm not selling anything. Just thought you guys would appreciate having your ideas stress-tested by something that actually fights back.

**EDIT:** Some of you are asking if this is just ""being negative for the sake of it."" Look, there's a difference between being a hater and being a realist. This prompt finds REAL vulnerabilities using proven attack methodologies. It's not just saying ""your idea sucks"" - it's showing you exactly HOW it could suck and what you can do about it.

# Run the Prompt Below

# Multi-Vector Threat Analysis (MVTA) Framework

# Red Team Simulation for Ideas, Products & Strategies

# Overview & Purpose

This framework helps stress-test new ideas by simulating adversarial attacks across multiple dimensions. Think of it as a ""war game"" for your concept before it faces the real world.

**Goal:** Break the idea so you can make it unbreakable.

# The Red Team

You're assembling a team of professional pessimists, each with a specific expertise:

    Role Focus Area 
    Lead Penetration Tester
     Technical and product flaws 
    Ruthless Competitor CEO
     Market and economic attacks 
    Skeptical Social Critic
     Public backlash and ethical crises 
    Cynical Regulatory Officer
     Legal and compliance ambushes 
    Master Political Strategist
     Narrative weaponization

# Step 1: Define Your Target Idea

Before running the analysis, clearly define these elements:

# Core Idea Components

**High Concept**

* One sentence description
* Example: *""A subscription box for artisanal, small-batch coffee from conflict-free regions""*

**Value Proposition**

* What problem does it solve for whom?
* Example: *""Provides coffee connoisseurs exclusive access to unique, ethically sourced beans they can't find elsewhere""*

**Success Metric**

* What does success look like in 18 months?
* Example: *""5,000 monthly subscribers with 75% retention rate""*

# Key Assumptions

**Market Assumptions**

* Target market size and willingness to pay
* Example: *""Large underserved market willing to pay premium for ethical sourcing""*

**Technical/Operational Assumptions**

* Infrastructure and capability requirements
* Example: *""Reliable supply chain for rare beans"" + ""Platform can handle 10,000 subscribers""*

**Business Model Assumptions**

* Pricing, margins, and revenue model
* Example: *""$40/month price point acceptable"" + ""40% gross margin maintainable""*

# Assets & Environment

**Key Assets**

* Proprietary advantages
* Brand/narrative strengths
* Example: *""Exclusive farm contracts"" + ""Founder is known coffee blogger""*

**Target Ecosystem**

* User persona
* Competitive landscape
* Regulatory environment

# Step 2: Vulnerability Scoring System

Rate each identified vulnerability using this scale:

    Score Impact Level Description 
    1
     
    Catastrophic
     Kill shot - fundamental, unrecoverable flaw 
    2
     
    Critical
     Crippling blow - requires fundamental pivot 
    3
     
    Significant
     Major weakness - significant damage/investment needed 
    4
     
    Moderate
     Manageable flaw - known, affordable solutions exist 
    5
     
    Resilient
     Negligible threat - strong against this attack

# Step 3: Execute Attack Simulations

# Vector 1: Technical & Product Integrity

**Attack Simulations:**

* **Scalability Stress Test** \- What breaks under growth?
* **Supply Chain Poisoning** \- How can inputs be corrupted?
* **Usability Failure** \- Where do users get frustrated and leave?
* **Systemic Fragility** \- What are the single points of failure?

# Vector 2: Market & Economic Viability

**Attack Simulations:**

* **Competitor War Game** \- How do competitors crush you?
* **Value Proposition Collapse** \- When does your value disappear?
* **Customer Apathy Analysis** \- Why might customers stop caring?
* **Channel Extinction Event** \- What if distribution channels disappear?

# Vector 3: Social & Ethical Resonance

**Attack Simulations:**

* **Weaponized Misuse Case** \- How can bad actors exploit this?
* **Cancel Culture Simulation** \- What triggers public backlash?
* **Ethical Slippery Slope** \- Where do good intentions go wrong?
* **Virtue Signal Hijacking** \- How can your message be corrupted?

# Vector 4: Legal & Regulatory Compliance

**Attack Simulations:**

* **Loophole Closing** \- What if regulations tighten?
* **Weaponized Litigation** \- How can lawsuits destroy you?
* **Cross-Jurisdictional Conflict** \- Where do different laws clash?

# Vector 5: Narrative & Political Weaponization

**Attack Simulations:**

* **Malicious Re-framing** \- How can your story be twisted?
* **Guilt-by-Association** \- What toxic connections exist?
* **Straw Man Construction** \- How can you be misrepresented?

# Step 4: Damage Report Format

# Executive Summary

List the 3-5 most critical vulnerabilities (scores 1-2) and any cascading failures.

# Vector Analysis Tables

For each vector, create a structured analysis:

    Attack Simulation Vulnerability Description Score Rationale for Attack Success [Simulation Name] [How it fails] [1-5] [Why it breaks]

# Vector Synthesis

Brief summary of overall resilience for each vector.

# Final Assessment: Cascading Failures

Identify the most dangerous chains of failure where one attack triggers others.

**Example:** *""Supply Chain Poisoning → Customer Illness → Public Backlash → Litigation → Value Proposition Collapse = Catastrophic failure chain""*

# Rules of Engagement

1. **Assume Worst-Case Plausibility** \- Attacks must be realistic, not fantasy
2. **No Hedging** \- Use direct, unambiguous language
3. **Mandatory Scoring** \- Every vulnerability gets a score
4. **Follow Structure** \- Use the exact format provided
5. **Identify Cascading Failures** \- Show how problems compound

# Ready to Begin?

1. Fill out your Target Idea Definition
2. Assemble your Red Team mindset
3. Execute the attack simulations
4. Compile your Damage Report
5. Use insights to strengthen your idea

In any case I feel as I got older and having more money of my own I was wanting to make bigger purchases. Me and my brother had saved up around $200 mowing lawns and were going to buy a booster box of Magic Cards. (This was probably 2001-2002)

I feel my mom shamed me in this idea and said no? I was all of a sudden not allowed to make the decision and didn’t - I don’t even remember what we did with that money I feel like it just got spent on slushies/chips/candy and renting videos.

I think after that I refrained from making big purchases - so instead of spending $200 on an espresso machine(or magic cards) I spent anywhere from $2-$6 on a cup of coffee almost everyday - waiting in line, making an order, waiting again, making small talk with the baristas and the other people there, smoking cigarettes outside, waiting to go to work. (The smokes are part of this too).

There were periods where I lived remotely and this wasn’t an option or where I would own a coffee machine etc but I have never bought one for myself and somehow I’ve tricked my brain into justifying the smaller purchases; I can like hear my mom in the back of my head.

Honestly I don’t think I’ve spent more than $200 on myself and I could count those occasions on one hand after 36 years.

Recently I’ve been talking with my brother and a friend bought me an espresso machine; today I was able to get my son to a babysitter and I have some free time and I actually went into a coffee shop for the first time in almost a year; occasionally I’ll do the drive thru with a friend but not often anymore - but while I was in there today I realize it’s not the coffee or the convenience, it’s the routine and the people and it’s so depressing. It just somehow makes you feel like part of the population - there is distance from others but you all of a sudden have an identity and are being seen by the staff and the other people; judged, labelled and categorized - and I am no exception, we all do it to each other. 

Anyway I’m not really sure where I was going with this; the money you pay while you go out for anything is not worth it - and I should have just bought the things that I wanted instead of just like waiting around in a weird daily routine of coffee and smokes and shit I don’t smoke anymore for almost a year and I have an espresso machine I just today was out and went for a drive and this just happened; the coffee is ok but I don’t think that’s what I am paying for.

Couple years ago, I moved down south to a humble little town settled near the wetlands. Nice place, small population, close enough to society so I don't go insane.

 The head of the HOA-was surprised to find this town had one actually-gave me a grand welcome speech and a small set of rules. Basic stuff: don't litter, don't feed the wildlife, no major noise complaints, don't feed the wildlife, secure your garbage from pests and of course- don't feed the wildlife. 

Now I grew up in the mountains of New Hampshire, I was no dumb yank thinking it was ok to feed Yogi table scraps. I don't think he meant anything by it either- but the heavy gentleman really wanted to get that last point across. Really rubbed me the wrong way, so I've kept to myself for the most part.

 Recently we've been hit with a massive heatwave-I'm talking 110-120 degrees a day. The humidity has been sky rocketing; the air is so muggy you could cut it like cake and eat it. 

Lucky for me-I have a pool.

 20x40 in ground with a depth of 15 feet at the end. When the wave hit, I spent every waking hour either hunched over in my office with the A/C cranked or lounging in the perfectly kept 65-degree water.  

Needless to say, the neighbors despise me. They have to contend with rinky-dink kiddie pools and barely functioning central air. We live right at the edge of the marshland, not too swampy but wild enough that occasionally something with four legs would wander in-hell sometimes even slither in. My neighbor, Ricky, once found a reticulated python curled up in his garbage can. 

That was a memorable trash day. 

But we've never had any major problems with the wildlife-until three nights ago. It was 10pm-I was parked on the couch next to my gorgeous girlfriend Laura. She's three years younger than me but she already has so much of her life together.

 I get by on a hefty inheritance while she works her ass off trying to get through college. She wants to be a marine biologist-a side effect from living her whole life next to a beach. 

We were curled up in front of the TV-being bathed in the warm glow of prime-time television. I've been trying to get her into some of the all-time classics. 

Though as her face grew pale and sickly as nazi prisoners sodomized each other-I probably should have started with a lighter program. She pulled away from me as a wheelchair bound inmate began to spin around and wax philosophy. 

""Sam this show is so tone death."" She moaned.

""Awe come on- I don't complain when we're watching your shows."" I bit back. 

""Yes, you do."" She countered. She had me there of course. Laura had bi-polar taste when it came to TV; somedays she wanted to watch some reality trash, the others a mind numbingly long nature doc about whales or penguin migration. I could stomach the trash but my god there's only so much you can learn about penguins before you want to blow your brains out. 

She made her way over to the kitchen counter to fix herself a drink. She mumbled something else to herself, some unheard backhanded thing that would have caused a blowout I'm sure-so I chose to ignore it. Laura brushed her tawny curls out of her face as she passive-aggressively slammed a glass onto the marble counter. 

To her back was the sliding glass door that led out the yard. The pool lights were dim-yet stood out like a beacon among the steady dark. You could barely make out the mini tiki hut tucked away at the pool's edge-the pride of my yard really. From outside you could hear the droning hum of cicadas in their relentless symphony. 

Sheepishly- I got up and shyly attempted to make peace. I leaned on the counter-it felt as cold as her shoulder. I averted my gaze as I attempted an apology.

""You're right-like usual."" I offered. She paused mid pour. The coke flowed into her icy glass as she burned her corneas into my face. 

""And like usual you're deflecting from the real issue. This isn't about that stupid show, and you know it."" Her voice was venomous; she'd fit right in with the snakes in the wetlands. I winced at her words- my mind gazing back to the fight we had earlier in the week.

 ""I thought we got past that."" I uttered. She scoffed as she poured a splash of rum in her drink.

 ""No, you just decided we were done talking about it-you've spent this whole week acting like nothing's wrong."" She pressed.

 ""Laura, I told you-it isn't a good time for me; I've been swamped at work-the economy is so tight right now I can't afford two people living here."" I explained. 

""You ""work"" from home and you have a trust fund-what bills do you think you're paying."" She barked at me.

""Uh-the pool, the 300$ rum you're guzzling right now, the 50-inch flat screen-"" I listed. 

""Why don't you just admit you don't want to commit-I graduate in three months, just rip the band-aid off now!"" Laura cried. Her voice cracked as she did and I was instantly flooded with guilt. ""We've been dating for two years Sam. It's starting to feel like a waste."" 

She turned away from me and looked out to the yard, drink in hand. I heard a muffled sniffle as I stewed in my guilt. I love her-shouldn't that be enough? If she moved in, I'd have to change up the whole decor, my whole routine. It just wouldn't flow right. 

Besides she was going to be off the whole summer on an internship so what would be the point. I swear I think she's just picking fights, so I'll beg her to stay. Still as I watched her silently gaze out the glass door-I felt a twinge of regret.

 I saddled up behind her, trying to find the right words. She leaned into the sliding door, squinting as she did. I tapped her shoulder and she squeaked out a gasp and twirled around to meet my gaze. She pointed out to the pool-gripping her rum and coke to her chest as she did. 

""Sam there's an alligator in your pool.""  She motioned to the dark. I groaned in annoyance and peered out as well. At first it was hard to tell what I was looking for, the tikihit looked untouched, grass trimmed neatly; then I focused on the pool. 

There was a long shadow sulking in it-this bulky, mishappen thing floating there in the deep end. It was big-from inside I guessed about 15 feet at least. There was this hump dead center in the thing-about five feet in an arch. I couldn't make out any markings or colors-but on either side of the gator were these piercing green eyes. 

They seemed to glow in the night, a haunting monster lounging in MY pool. It wasn't my first gator-they're worse than deer down here- but something about these eyes unnerved me. There was thought behind them, like it was watching us back. 

I opened the sliding door and was smacked in the face by the humid night. I tiptoed out and Laura grabbed my arm. 

""Sam what are you doing?"" She hissed at me. I broke away and spoke at a low whisper.

""I just want to get a better look at it. He's basking-won't bug me if I keep my distance."" I calmly explained. She darted her eyes back to the lounging creature.

""Be careful- I think there's something wrong with it."" She couldn't take her sight off that bizarre hump on the thing-like a ridged arch almost. I shook my head and stepped closer. The grass felt cool and moist under foot-you could almost hear the squelch with every step. A few feet and I was stepping on tiled stone, the ""beachhead"" tiki bar overlooking the base of the pool.

 I had set up all the bar stools and tiki decor near the deep end-so I could get plastered and just dive right in. Makes for some fun parties. My only light was the low pool LEDs lining the sides. They casted a thick shadow on our guest-but up close I got a better idea of the size. 

It was 20 feet easy-slim but leathery skin gripping to it. Those light bulbs never left me-I could feel the gator drilling a hole into the side of my head. I was fumbling under the tiki bar-searching for the deck light switch. 

It was a swanky set up I had; Christmas lights embedded around the roof and four flood lights on any corner. When I finally switched it on-the tiki bar burst to life with ravenous energy. The backyard became flooded with sparkling illumination. 

It then quickly became apparent the thing in my pool was not an alligator. 

I was met with this massive square snout-rows of pointed teeth sprouting out in a faux smile. The thing was brown and scaley-stripes of lemon yellow painted its ridged back. The ridge ran all the way down its tail-which swayed in the water like an eel. 

The monster was keeping itself afloat with massive trunk-like hindlegs with three pointed talons that looked like they could easily slice me open. Its maw was flat-loose skin folded in on itself like a gular fold you'd see on a croc's neck. 

That's sort of what looked like- a mutant crocodile on steroids. The creature blinked-and three eye lids folded back to reveal reptilian eyes-lime green around the slitted iris. Its arms were folded near the chest, meaty looking paws that looked like they could maul a bear.

 I stood there safely behind the tiki bar-ignoring the fact that all that was between me and this monster was wicker and cheap plaster. There was this awful smell surrounding it as well-like a swamp full of sweat. For what seemed like eons we just locked eyes with each other, like we were trying to figure each other out. 

From the bowels of the beast, I heard this guttural snore. It emitted a low bellow-a warning maybe. I backed away slowly, and the monster unfolded its arms. It grabbed the edge-each of its six fingers at least a foot long and ending in gnarled black claw. It slowly began to pull itself out of the pool-water sliding off the beast's hide with ease.

 It didn't break its gaze on me once. I looked around-there was nothing to defend with besides poorly made barstools. The gaping maw slowly opened-the monster bellowed at me-this reptilian hiss that sent shivers down my spine. It had dragged half of its body out when I snapped out of it and booked it back to the back door. 

The monster lunged, throwing itself onto the tiki bar. I didn't look back, but I heard a deafening collapse as it shattered the tiki bar under its weight. The lights snapped off-enveloping me in inky dark. My only saving grace was the beckoning backdoor-a glorious beacon among the blackness of the pit. 

Laura opened the door for me-I bolted in as she slammed it shut. The sliding glass rattled and wobbled like it was going to collapse. I ran into the counter- a wild eye on me. I twirled around to see my pursuer had given up almost immediately.

 It slunk back into the cool of the pool, dragging a trail of broken wicker and tangled lights with it. It swam around for a moment then went back to basking in the moonlight-those emerald embers shinning in the dark. 

I caught my breath as Laura studied the creature, curiosity overtaking her like a cat in heat. 

""Laura get away from the door."" I harshly spoke. She stepped back slightly, barely listening to what I was saying. She turned to me-eyes lighting up like a child on Christmas. 

""Sam it's a dinosaur!"" She squealed. She was practically leaping up and down in awe-dare I say she was giddy. She seemed oblivious to the fact the thing had nearly squashed me. I saddled up next to her, disdain for the beast striking my face.

""Laura, that's impossible. It's a-mutant or something.  Crocodile got into some industrial run off or something."" I muttered, more to convince myself than anything. The dinosaur bellowed in the night-like a low-grade foghorn. 

It seemed satisfied that it had chased me off and was just- chilling in my pool now. Laura pointed out the ridge and started raving about it.

 ""Look at that arc, almost a perfect 180."" She whistled. ""It probably wandered in from the marshlands. If it's hot here I can't imagine the sauna fuming out there.""

""Laura please just get away from the window-what if its hungry and decides it wants a midnight snack."" I spoke, realizing how frail and smashable my six hundred-thousand-dollar home was. I ran around the house like a mad man, switching lights off and drawing blinds. 

Laura was following me around like a puppy dog and yapping like one as well. She had her phone out taking pictures, talking about the ""greatest discovery in history"" and ""She would call her marine bio professor in the morning."" 

That last bit seemed like a dig to me-that was the guy who was dragging her away on a three-month internship in the Atlantic. She was blinded by childlike wonder-meanwhile I'm the one who actually came face to fang with that thing. 

Course I wasn't going to let her go out and experience the wonder for herself-that would be a shitty thing to do. Instead, we hunkered down in my room with all the lights off and waited till morning.

 I didn't sleep a wink that night. My bedroom is on the second floor-decent sized room and there's a massive bay window looking out into the backyard. I get a nice view of the yard- the hulking cypress and strangling vines, looks like something out of *Jungle Book* sometimes. 

I laid in bed like a coward-watching this creature just swim gently around the pool. At times it brayed out into the night-and to my terror I realized I've heard that mournful groan before. There have been times late into the night where I'd be sitting at the tiki bar in a drunken haze and I'd listen to the midnight loon calls and the swamp symphony. 

I'd hear thunderous cries and rapid chirps-like a hawk scatting to itself. I'd sit there and think ""*Damn that's a big gator*."" Fireflies would swirl around to match my vision-and I'm beginning to think some of those waltzing orbs weren't fireflies. Some of them stood in place-stalking spheres that always seemed to linger but disappeared in a blink. 

While I was crashing out-Laura sat cross legged by the window taking notes like she was on safari. Around 4am I passed out-and only awoke to the searing sunlight crossing in. I sat up to find Laura was gone, and the pool was empty. I'd chalk the whole thing up to some fever dream-but that wouldn't account for my tiki bar laying in pieces and the wicker debris floating calmly in the pool. 

I raced downstairs-calling out to Laura. I heard her arguing with someone in the kitchen as she was packing up her purse. Her phone was glued to her head as she rummaged around for something.

 ""-No Brian I- you saw the photos; you know me why would I make something like this up? Well, it was dark I- no I'm coming now I just can't find my keys. Alright I'll talk more when I get in."" She hung up on Brain as I cleared my throat. She looked up, excitement having not left her face since midnight. 

""Oh, good you're up. There's coffee on the stove- I got to head to class I'm in a rush. Keep an eye out for our friend just-be careful ok Sam?"" she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before I could get a word in.

""Wait-that's it? What about the giant lizard in my yard?"" I whined, not a proud moment I admit.

""Call me if it comes back-I saw it lumber off into the swamp around 5- I think it's hunting."" She oozed fascination with it. ""That was Brian- my professor. He's-skeptical obviously but I think I can convivence him. This is huge Sam-It could make my whole career."" 

""That-that's great."" I stammered, half happy for her, half terrified at the prospect of the dino coming back.  ""But what if it does come back? I don't have a gun or anything-what if it tries to break in?"" I whispered. She scoffed at my fear and went towards the front door after finally fishing her keys out. 

""I did some research while you slept-as long as you keep your distance it'll leave you alone. You've lived her two years without incident-if it's been out there at least that long it would it would have attacked by now. It's just hot."" She shrugged her shoulders-completely dismissing my concerns. With that she waved goodbye and drove off in her jeep, leaving me alone at the door.

 I spent the morning texting her ""updates"" as I cleaned up the mess it left in its wake. I say updates but really, I was just telling her I was ok and making sure she wasn't freaking out in secret. She was taking the whole thing way too easy in my opinion. 

I think she's a thrill junkie- I took her scuba diving for our first-year anniversary and some sharks showed up. Everyone else in the group nearly drowned each other trying to get back on the boat but Laura?

 She kept her distance, but she was all in-she was so graceful-dancing around the fined menaces like it was nothing. When I finally pulled her out of the water she complained and wanted to keep going, started going on and on about shark bite statistics and how they ""never really bite"" and ""You were more likely to get mauled by a moose then bit by a shark.""

 I love her but she's nuts when it comes to stuff like that. Me personally? I'm perfectly content staying in and watching the game-brew in hand. Anyway, I started cleaning up what was left of the hut, I was also sweating like a pig and nervously watching the tree line. 

My mind was screwing with me; I was jumping at every little shadow and call echoing out from the swamp. Any time the bushes moved I'd freeze and raise a piece of cracked wood in my hand like a club.

 I don't know what I thought I'd do against it but if I could jam the thing in an eye socket it would buy me sometime. By noon I had collapsed onto a beach chair- I had raked most of the fallen wires and stuff out of the pool and I just wanted to relax. 

Unfortunately, God wanted to fuck with me personally- because it was that moment I heard thudding coming from the swamp. The tree line parted ways as the dinosaur emerged from the swamp. In the midnight sun I was able to get a clear look at the thing.

 It was more wide than tall, only standing a few feet off the ground. The ridge gave off this brilliant yellow hue as the stripes traveled down the dino's spine and up its head. It formed a downward arrow at the base of the skull, pointing up the duck-billed maw. It was supporting its weight on all fours, talon-like arms caked in mud and what appeared to be dried blood. 

The undercarriage of the dino was stone white and Scalley, like the belly of a croc. Its chainmail like scutes were too numerous to count, but varied in their shades as it traveled the length of this hulking beast. In its maw it carried a fresh kill- the bloody body of a whit-tailed doe lay limp in its grasp.

 It was secured in a vice grip yet carried gently-like it didn't want to waste any part before it could safely eat at its den. The beast slumped forward- dipping a painted claw in the shallow end. It cooed like it was delighted and threw itself in pointing its maw to the sky to keep the well-earned meal dry. 

It began to chew and chomp at the bits-a dog with his bone. I heard what was left of the deer's skeleton crack and splinter as the dino snapped its jaws-eager to spill the meat down its gullet. I turned away, grimacing as it feed. 

I was halfway between the pool and backdoor-I'll give Laura this, she was right. The dino was completely ignoring me. Granted it had a fresh meal now. It swam to the edge of the deep and rested the deer carcass on the pool deck. 

It raised itself up like it carefully, like it was sitting down at the dinner table, and grabbed each end and tore into it. I could hear flesh peeling away from shattered bone as it gleefully had its fill. Even as it feed- I could feel its emerald gaze out of the corner of its eye. Like it was daring me to try and take the meal. 

Instead, I took my chair and scooted further away. After it was done it left what little remained to rot on the grass- and pulled away from the edge. It lazily drifted in the pool, aimlessly basking in the heat. It took notice of me once and-growled, I think. At least that's what I think that low guttural bellow meant when I tried to resume clean-up.

 It also raised its log of a tail and splashed down-spraying me with ice cold water when I got too close. I jumped back and gasped, those icy droplets burned my tanned hide. I gave up and started to head back inside. 

That's when I noticed a beige bucket hat bobbing up and down past the fence. My neighbor Ricky poked his head up and leaned over, a friendly smile etched on his fiery red face.

 ""Morning Sam! Lotta commotion this morning everything-"" He paused as he took notice of the leviathan lounging in the water. I thought he would take off screaming but instead he whistled at it in admiration. ""Well, I'll be damned-ya got Lucile in your yard. Awe that's quite an honor friend."" He offered. I Looked at him slack jawed. I ran up to him, frantically pointing at the monster evidently named ""Lucile."" 

""Rick, you look at that-that thing and then look me in the eyes. You're telling me that's normal?!?"" I shrieked at him. He simply shrugged. 

""Been a few years since she roamed this far in-but it's just Lucile. She's harmless-all things considered. Didn't Wayne give you the rundown when ya first moved in?"" he offered.

 I recalled when the head of the HOA- a portly balding man who I vaguely remember being named Wayne- trying to give me a packet and explain some stuff. I assumed it was just a list of dues I'd pay later and by that point I was tired and rundown so I kind of kicked him to the curb.

 In my defense I was really hungover and jetlagged, had a lot of unpacking to do. Hadn't heard a peep from him since. Like I said I tried to keep to myself-have a lot going on and I travel a lot for work.

 I explained all this to Ricky who got a weird look on his face. He sheepishly stepped away from the fence and mumbled something.

""What was that?"" I snapped at him.

""Nothing Sam. Listen don't worry about Lucile-it's this damn heat its drawing all sorts of critters out of the woodwork. I got something mussing around my birdfeeder as well-know what I mean?"" He hinted. I was drawing a blank to be honest and stood silent. 

""I'll give Wayne a shout and see if he can swing by at some point-he can probably explain it better than I can. You have a good day then buddy."" he flashed that southern charm at me than swaggered back to his house. 

That was a couple days ago-and I am at my wits end now. ""Lucile"" has completely taken over my yard-she leaves animal carcass lying around, she lumbers around in the pool all damn day and night, and she snaps at me when I go near her. 

I'm half tempted to lure her back into the swamp with a pile of sirloins or something like that-because I want my damn pool back. I told animal control there was a ""croc"" because who would believe it otherwise right?

 Like I said before they came and ran almost immediately. No one in the neighborhood seems bothered by this, in fact I've had people try to come behind to get a photo of her like she's a novelty act. People go in Rick's yard, and I see them peering over the fence like peeping toms. I tell them to get lost and they get mean and snarky.

 Am I the asshole here? 

Everyone is just acting so damn nonchalant like this is an everyday thing its driving me up the wall. Laura has been texting me non-stop, bugging me for updates on what she's doing. She's stuck at her dorm for the rest of the week but every few minutes I get text from her. 

It's kind of nice actually, we haven't talked like this in a couple months. I just wish we were talking about literally anything else. I'm not interested in where it came from- I just want to keep it out of my yard. \\

Wayne is supposed to stop by tomorrow and break it down for me but I'm not holding my breath for any quick solutions. I'll update if anything comes up but for now-does anyone had any ideas on how to reclaim my yard from this frigging dinosaur?",1,1752170740.0,u_Kaijufan22,0,1.0,False

I’m 27, gay, and honestly just looking to meet chill people, whether it’s dating or just grabbing coffee. I expected the usual swiping game, but I was surprised this time. The app seemed a bit different now. More people actually had bios, and a few even listed what they were really looking for. That was already better than the last time I used it in 2022, where it felt like a silent photo gallery.

I matched with this guy two weeks ago, super normal convo, nothing forced. We joked about how we both hate the Tinder “hi” messages, ended up talking about food, and met for ramen three days later. It wasn’t some magical love story or anything, but it didn’t feel like a waste of time either. That’s rare for me on dating apps.

I still ran into a bunch of blank profiles or guys just wanting nudes, but not as bad as before. Seems like Tinder’s gotten slightly better for actual gay connection. Still not perfect though. Curious how other gay guys are finding it in 2025. Better, worse, or still just a swipe-and-forget app?",1,1752170718.0,casualdating,0,1.0,False

But this is unabashedly greedy and money pinching that it’s baffling they have the balls to do this to us.

-Basically no soft pity
-No guaranteed banner at launch
-No real improvements to that the CN/TW has
-Expedited banners and updates with no increase to rewards/currency
-Worse login rewards 
-Not having limited characters become standard right after banner(which was the real kicker for me)
 -Greedy ads posted almost everywhere and in the shop when CN/TW didn’t have that.
-Lazy translation/lack of communication as shown on the livestream and social media sites.
-Level Blocks that weren’t in the CN/TW version just to get more money from coffee box sales.

I’ve never seen a gatcha be THIS greedy and think its audience is stupid enough to just go along with it. I really can’t believe it at all. The worse part is the gameplay itself is really good. AAA I might say and that’s what makes this situation even worse. I don’t want the game to be EOS but we gotta make a change and make sure that our voices are heard. Whether that be giving 1-star reviews or not spending on the game at all so that they know we’re serious.

I currently make pourover coffee at home, and am looking to add in espresso to my at home rotation. One thing is, I have gotten back into making coffee after stopping for about two years. The last time I was making coffee at home, I had this cheap blade coffee grinder that I have since misplaced. I would like to buy a conical burr grinder, a hand one. Something about a hand grinder speaks to me, I like that it doesn't take up counter space, and I feel like something manual has fewer opportunities to break. 

To be clear, I would like to purchase a grinder that can allow grind settings for both espresso and pour-over. 

My dad asked his coffee affection-ado coworkers for grinder recommendations. One they recommended was the 1Zpresso J-Ultra Foldable Coffee Grinder, Iron Grey. I looked into it, and it seems it's more ideal for only espresso. One alternative I found was the 1Zpresso J Manual Coffee Grinder Silver Capacity 35g with Assembly Stainless Steel Conical Burr - Numerical Internal Adjustable Setting, which seems like it's equally useful for espresso and pourover, and a little more affordable to boot. 

  
Does anybody have experience with either of these devices? My mom was acting like a manual grinder would be a huge waste of energy, but manual burr grinders seem easy to use to me ( unlike manual blade).

Her debut novel? Turned down by twenty publishers. Her freelance pitches? Ignored. Her savings? Gone. She moved back into her childhood bedroom, shared blog posts that got five views (three from her), and worked night shifts at a diner.

One night, after spilling coffee on her only printed manuscript, she almost gave up. She cried over the pages, convinced she'd wasted a decade chasing ghosts.

But something pushed her back to the keyboard maybe spite, maybe hope.

She rewrote everything. No formulas. No rules. Just *her*. She titled it *The Last Draft*.

This time, a small indie publisher said yes.

The book didn’t become a bestseller.

But it found readers. One wrote: “This saved me.”

And that made Lena realize: her words didn’t need to reach millions—just *someone*.

She kept writing.

And this time, she wasn’t chasing success.

She was living it.

I even added a leftover piano I still had from Simon’s Coffee!

The name *The Golden Years* is a little tribute to David Bowie (huge fan here), so I’m planning on adding more tiny posters of his *Golden Years* album on the walls later and also create small albums.

For now, the structure is up ( I had expanded the base and added a small toilet room), I’ve wallpapered everything, laid the floors (wood-print paper), and spray-painted the windows, doors, and some wall elements in gold. If you ever try this, **prime first** before spray painting: it really makes a difference!

I also started reworking the furniture from the original kits: painted it all black to fit the pub vibe. Oh, and I had these little pizza savers saved up (the plastic kind you get with takeaway pizza), and they’re now turning into mini tables for the pub terrace—spraypainted them gold too and I’m weirdly proud of them 😄

Still figuring out what to do about the bar accessories... finding things like tiny glasses, bottles, or even a bar tap at 1:24 scale is tough. Anyone ever made or found something like that on this tiny scale or know how to create them DIY?

The pub diorama isnt finished yet! :-)

I saw one of those TikTok's that said “be the main character of your own life” and for some reason, I took that personally. Like, I fully committed. I thought it meant I needed to slow-walk everywhere, drink black coffee, write in a journal, maybe cry dramatically on a bus. You know, ✨main character energy✨.

Day 1: I set my alarm for 5:30 AM to “watch the sunrise” and journal. My dumb ass locked myself out of the apartment holding a half-full mug and my phone at 2%. No shoes. No keys. Just me, a cracked mug, and the deep shame of my neighbors watching me try to climb back in through the window like a raccoon.

Day 2: Decided to do the whole ""write poetry in a park while sipping overpriced oat milk"" thing. A pigeon flew directly over me and took a fat one on my notebook. Landed on the line where I wrote: *“The universe is always speaking.”* It sure did.

Day 3: I tried walking confidently through the grocery store like it was a runway. My foot hit the edge of a pallet, I went down like a sack of potatoes. My bananas and self-esteem scattered in all directions.

Day 4: I bought a thrift store typewriter because apparently that’s “main character aesthetic.” It doesn’t even work. It smells weird. I think it’s haunted.

Day 5: Took myself on a solo dinner date. The waiter legit asked if I got stood up. I laughed it off and said, “No, just being mysterious.” He gave me a free brownie. I still don’t know if it was pity or flirtation, but whatever, free dessert is free dessert.

Day 6: Chipped my tooth trying to open a wine bottle with a key because I “didn’t need a corkscrew.” I did. I very much did.

By Day 7, I gave up and binge-watched reality TV in bed while eating cereal with a fork. Because the spoons were all dirty. Don’t ask.

Anyway. Main character week is over. I’m going back to being a background character with working teeth.",2,1752170191.0,story,0,1.0,False

They do not know the half of it. So I finish whatever I'm doing. I chew my food slowly and swallow. I flush. I press for the penthouse—I make them wait. And they do. They know I am a weapon. But what can such a weapon say? Does random chance suffice? 

I never asked to be an agent. To be scouted or vetted, to be analyzed and digitally erased. I didn't offer up my psychometrics for trajectory determination by super secret spy tech. To be yanked from my life and bleached off the grid, stripped of clothes and fingerprints. To be diametrically paired with a fedora and thrown naked and screaming into a gauntlet for trials. That I might be sharpened like a razor or snapped into pieces. 

Everyone I ever loved was mind-wiped and relocated—the agency's method of making the faintest memory of me mine alone. Now I slip through the world without a face. Without a singular identity. Without a reflection. All but invisible to modern surveillance—a digital smear in photographs. I am impervious to arrest. To assault or harm. To fatigue or failure. 

My current assignment I do in my sleep: secure an administrative position on an internet dating server and take out a meddlesome mod by any means necessary. Alt accounts, channel spam. Random DM dick pics. You name it. I laugh at the shiny facade of the world wide web—what enthusiasts know of the net is but a thin and soapy film atop the ocean I swim in. While they skip stones across its surface, we Fedoras plunge into the shadowy depths.

I am ever circling. Watching. A shark with a fake moustaches on my dorsal fin. 

At night I drink, but my fedora keeps me keen. It neutralizes the alcohol in my bloodstream. To all the world it's just a hat, but before my eyes, data cascades off its brim with the rain. It tells me who to kill and how. Where to find them and when. It does not tell me why, for I do not ask. There are always three reasons to kill someone, and the fedora knows them all. It guides me with restraint, so that I may perform without it. I lay on my back on the couch, my retinas scrolling my fedora's constant server feed. She is idle, my current target, logged into a main account and two others. Sock puppets. Alternate identities she uses to deceive her own server. She lures men into traps. Baits them with bots they call their girlfriend for months. Years almost. The hat is not fooled, so neither am I. Not anymore.

I must never take it off. 

My court appointed psychiatrist says otherwise. Just for thirty seconds, he says. My fedora offers his blood pressure and a script for what to say to make it spike. It tells me the current location of his wife. 

Using a doll, he demonstrates how to remove a hat. It will feel good, he says, to get some air on that thing. That sweaty scalp. I tell him just now his wife is stretching her glutes with a downward dog at Maximum Yoga. I ask, how was the movie last night? His bank transactions flash beneath the brim of my fedora and I ask if he'd enjoyed the sushi, after? Did he care to know the contents of his wife's fortune cookie? I can provide it. Via the watchful gaze of the camera in the INTERAC machine nearest the table they dined at.

My psychiatrist says I'm doing it again—the furious blinking. He cannot see that I am engaging with the fedoral interface. He says he isn't married. He invites me to entertain that sleeping and showering in a fedora is unsual. He says, is it not? I tell him to watch himself. His mother just stepped off the number 5 bus. She's just now attempting to cross a street whose immediate traffic includes electric cars with laughably encrypted driverless options. I tell him I just revved an engine and cranked a stereo.

Again, he says, mildly threatening.

Mildly? I just blasted his mother with bright blue high beams. I've barely hinted at all that falls under my fedora's control, and I control the fedora. I dare him to test me. I say his own blood pressure just spiked indeed. I take a deep breath and read the feed, that his mother is eighty-six with three remaining siblings, how she worked as a nurse in her youth but only in the war. I tell him she saw a unicorn in a coffee stain and described this to his sister on the 7th of June. That his sister expressed concern, yet her very next call indifferently secured seating at Le Blanche—whose head chef, a sleeper agent my hat could activate, is presently tonguing a bottom molar full of cyanide. 

He asks if I have intentions with his mother.

I tell him there would be no point, his mother will die of prostate cancer, but I withhold precisely when. This is new, he says. I did not tell him my fedora has access to future events? 

I tip my hat, cooly. Bold of him to assume it could not. Women don't have prostates, he says, and his mother is upstairs—this is a family practice. He asks if I'd like to be introduced, briefly, before her jog. I narrow my eyes. If only he knew what the fedora knows...who his mother really is. And, as it turns out—with a quick scan of remote drives—explicitly how that came to be.  
  
How she came to be his mother, he says? Indeed. Like, in vivid, pornographic resolution. Slow motion camera tech embedded in cheap, VHS converter tech. A camera also in his mother's microwave (they conceived him in a kitchen, circa 1987). Cameras whose footage is available to me at any time. Even now. To enjoy. 

He's increasing my medication, he says. Fine. The fedora will neutralize the effects. Then I should have no problem taking my pills, he says. Just so you know, I say, you were this close to ending up a mess on your mother's cleavage. That's just...lovely, he says. She complained, I say. Had her favorite sundress on, I say. ""Let's not get too crazy tonight"" is the only reason he exists.

I possess a stunning amount of information, he says. Because I never remove my fedora. Next week, he says, I can tell him more about that chatbot that snuck under the radar. But it didn't. That's impossible. I was studying her, I say. Playing along. She fooled nobody.

He slaps closed his notebook. I think that's enough for today, Mr. Smelly-Head.

1lwjbxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfRuneterra/comments/1lwjbxv/riot_games_stole_my_money/,Riot games stole my money.,"I'd think as one of riot's whales they would appreciate the time, effort, and dollars I put into this game, but they've decided this was the time to fuck me over.

I've been maxed out on everything but gemstones for a minute. I regularly reach the cap on wild fragments just in time for the next expansion. Riot has decided to take the last week off per their company culture. Perfectly fine and acceptable. People deserve time off. The only problem being I bought their daily login rewards bundle assuming I wouldn’t run out of space before the next expansion. The extra week they took off threw a wrench in that plan. I ended up with 5 frags over the max within a few days of when the next expansion would have already dropped. To make matters worse, I happened to reach legend level 73 while I was capped out. What’s the reward for legend level 73? **40 wild fragments**. They ended up going straight into the void. I opened up a ticket to see if there was anything to be done but they fed me the old song and dance about company policy and all that shit. Nevermind that their new company policy around refunds means virtually nothing a PvE player buys can ever be refunded, but that’s a different rant.

And yes, I realize in the grand scheme this isn’t a big deal. 40 frags are the equivalent of 8 days of the login reward bonuses. Assuming the login bundle is 475 coins, which is 5 dollars, 5 wild frags ends up being an approximate value of 18 cents. For the level up bonus I lost around $1.44. For the unclaimed login rewards I’ll end up having lost $1.08. A grand total of **$2.52**. Big fuckin whoop. I’ve dropped around $1400 on this game alone. An amount of money that probably wouldn’t even buy me a cup of coffee shouldn’t be an issue. That isn’t the point.

The point is that if the small few of us are willing to keep the game alive through the occasional cash injection, they should at least be willing to work with us when the system fucks us over. **I don’t even really need the frags.** I’m probably gonna 6 star Mel and whoever else comes out within the day of their release. It’s the principle of the thing. Why is there even a cap on wild fragments in the first place? Who does it hurt if a player wants to hoard their resources? It’s PvE!

**TL;DR**: Yes, riot stole my money, but it’s barely enough money to matter. The issue is they should be more willing to work with people who spend money on their game when the currency system makes a mistake.",0,1752169974.0,LegendsOfRuneterra,5,0.13,False

1lwjble,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheReliableToolbox/comments/1lwjble/uncover_the_truth_behind_minwax_finishing_wax/,"Uncover the truth behind Minwax Finishing Wax, Grain Highlighting Wood Filler review!","Testing the **Minwax 401140000 Finishing Wax, Grain Highlighting** has been quite an interesting journey. This is one of those products I initially underestimated but have grown to respect over repeated use. As someone who loves bringing out the inherent beauty of wood furniture and trim, I couldn’t wait to apply this finishing wax to several pieces in my collection. 

The Minwax finishing wax is marketed as a grain-highlighting product that whitens and accentuates the wood grain. I have to admit, that description intrigued me. Whether it’s my antique coffee table or the kitchen cabinets screaming for a makeover, I could see the potential. The hand-rubbed finish it promises sounded like the gentle classic touch that could elevate any interior wood surface.  

**Ease of Application**  
Working with the product was a pleasant surprise. The application process is straightforward—just rub it in with a clean cloth, and you’re good to go. Its creamy consistency made spreading on bare or previously stained wood remarkably smooth. I tried it on a side table that had seen better days, and the wood grain popped beautifully with just one coat. The drying process took about an hour, which I found convenient because I’m impatient when it comes to DIY projects. However, the room did smell a bit like a hardware store—more on that later.

[Check Minwax 401140000 Finishing Wax price on Amazon.](https://powertools4u.com/p/b086fd1xpd/)

**Performance and Finishing Results**  
What struck me most about this wax was how well it brought out the subtle details of the wood grain. The whitening effect was subtle but noticeable, giving my pieces a rejuvenated and refreshed appearance while retaining their natural look. Its matte finish feels elegant without being overbearing. Still, for high-traffic furniture pieces like my dining chairs, I’d recommend following up with a topcoat for extra durability.

**Benefits**  
- Effortless one-coat application.  
- Enhances the natural beauty of wood grain.  
- Fast-curing, which is perfect for impatient DIYers.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Strong odor during application, so make sure the room is ventilated.  
- Not suitable for outdoor use—strictly indoor surfaces only.  

**Durability**  
After a few weeks of normal usage, I noticed the finish on high-touch areas like drawer handles started to dull slightly. While this isn’t a dealbreaker, it’s worth mentioning if you’re planning to use it on furniture that sees heavy action. A quick reapplication does restore the original shine, which was easy enough to do.

**Target User for the Product**  
This finishing wax is ideal for hobbyists or anyone interested in restoring wooden furniture, cabinetry, or trim. It’s not for someone looking for a heavy-duty protective finish; instead, it’s better for adding character to decorative indoor pieces. If your projects are purely aesthetic and you don’t mind the occasional touch-up, you’ll enjoy using this wax.

**Positives**  
- Easy to apply and beginner-friendly.  
- Adds subtle whitening without being too obvious.  
- Feels budget-friendly for small-scale DIY needs.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Not resistant to heavy wear and tear over time.  
- The odor might bother sensitive users without proper ventilation.  

**Other Options**  
When shopping for finishing products, I always cross-compare. Versus competing products like Howard Feed-N-Wax or Briwax, the Minwax finishing wax excels in its ease of use and quick curing time. Briwax, for example, offers a more lustrous finish but can be tricky to apply for those newer to wood finishes. Howard’s product, meanwhile, leaves a stronger scent and may need more curing steps. Still, both competitors lean toward offering darker tones, while Minwax sticks firmly to its grain-lightening specialty. Its competitive niche makes it worth considering for specific lighter-toned wood projects.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its features, fantastic coverage, and aesthetic results, I found the price worth the investment. This isn’t the kind of product that empties your wallet, and the results make every penny feel well spent. Comparing other grain-enhancing finishes in the market, it sits comfortably as a value-for-money buy.

1lwjbbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lwjbbs/does_the_zojirushi_micom_water_boiler_deliver_on/,Does the Zojirushi Micom Water Boiler Deliver on Performance and Convenience?,"Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH Micom Water Boiler & Warmer has quickly become one of those appliances I didn’t know I needed until I started using it daily. Just imagine the convenience of always having hot water ready for your tea, coffee, or even instant noodles. With its micro-computerized temperature control and stainless-steel design, this product feels built to last, but it’s not without a few quirks. Allow me to break down my experience with this sleek water boiler.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of the Micom Water Boiler & Warmer is a definite highlight for me. Its stainless-gray exterior is polished and sleek, blending perfectly with any modern kitchen setup. Beyond aesthetics, the rust-resistant stainless-steel interior is easy to clean, a must-have feature for someone like me who values hassle-free maintenance. What makes it even more practical is the swivel base that allows for effortless serving, especially useful during family get-togethers. The detachable lid adds further convenience, making refilling and cleaning a breeze. At 7.09 pounds, it is sturdy without being a pain to move around, though I wouldn’t call it lightweight.  

**Functionality and Features**  
The functionality of this water boiler didn’t just meet my expectations—it exceeded them. Having four different temperature settings (160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F) is a game-changer. Whether I want to steep green tea to perfection or heat water for a quick bowl of soup, there’s a setting tailor-made for it. The Quick Temp Mode is incredibly handy for mornings when I’m in a rush. Instead of boiling the water, it quickly heats to a pre-determined keep-warm temperature, saving both time and energy. Another nifty addition is its sound alerts. The soft beeping is just loud enough to catch my attention when the boiling process ends or when the water level is low, which is a lifesaver for my perpetually distracted self.

**Energy Efficiency and Timer Settings**  
One of the features I didn’t realize I’d appreciate as much as I do is the energy-saving timer. You can set it for a delay of 6 to 10 hours, which helps reduce unnecessary power usage when you know you won’t be needing hot water for a while. The electric heating element also seems to work efficiently compared to other similar products I’ve used. If sustainability and energy efficiency matter to you, this unit checks both boxes.

[Check Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b07cb98837/)

**Good Points**  
After using the boiler for several weeks, some strong points stood out:  
- The user-friendly swivel base simplifies serving.  
- BPA-free surfaces ensure safer water quality.  
- Quick Temp Mode is a fantastic time-saver during busy mornings.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
As good as it is, there’s always room for tweaks:  
- The sound alert volume isn’t adjustable, and while it’s not overly loud, a customizable option would be ideal.  
- At 11.25 inches in length, it occupies a decent amount of counter space.  

**Alternative Options**  
When comparing the Micom Water Boiler & Warmer with other similar appliances on the market, a couple of notable competitors come to mind. Panasonic and Tiger both manufacture products with comparable features, but Zojirushi has the edge when it comes to precise temperature settings and Quick Temp functionality. The Tiger model I tested felt heavier and lacked the timer feature, whereas the Panasonic unit didn’t come with a stainless-steel interior and was harder to clean. Additionally, the Zojirushi’s sound indicators felt more intuitive than its counterparts, which simply rely on visual cues.

**Value for Money**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, I’d say this boiler offers excellent value. Its well-thought-out design, multiple temperature settings, and energy-efficient features make it a worthwhile investment. While it may not be the cheapest water boiler out there, the combination of durability and functionality justifies the cost, in my opinion.

1lwj9ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/walstad/comments/1lwj9ya/question_about_substrate/,Question about substrate,"Hi everyone! I've been learning about this method as a sustainable way to set up a tank with live plants, and I have a couple of questions. Many people suggest different things included in the dirt layer, like natural boosters made out of a variety of stuff, Coco coir, compost, and other stuff.
So I have access to regular garden soil. My mom has a homemade compost pile, where she throws things like dead leaves, fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds and stuff like that. It's full of red worms and the bottom of the pile is a rich black soil that works wonderfully with her plants, but I'm not sure if it'd work for an aquarium. I also have diatomaceous earth, which I've seen recommended, so I could add that.
Should I include the compost? How much of it? What else is absolutely necessary and should invest in getting somehow?
Also, I've seen sand that is basically quite fine gravel, and also white quartz sand that is extremely fine, which should I get? I'm afraid this very fine sand might be easily disturbed.

&nbsp;


#**City Alleyway (30x57)**

**5 levels, 12 buildings, all in one huge alleyway! Welcome to NEW multilevel maps!**

&nbsp;

*Today's special early-post map set heralds the first of some semi-regular epic multi-level builds that I'm incredibly proud of. This 5-level map of Cornflower Alley is the culmination of around 80 hours work, and I hope you can make use of it!*

*There's another multi-level map lined up for Saturday 19th - a glorious tavern with galleried upper levels - and every so often after that (including an absolute gem of a castle that has taken 60 hours so far, a graveyard with a multi-level underground cave system, a lovely chapel with a soaring high roof inside, and more!)*

*Thank you for your support, I couldn't do this without you <3*

&nbsp;

**Welcome to Cornflower Alley – a tight and winding merchant-studded artery in the heart of a bustling city.**

With 12 individual buildings comprising of businesses at street level and residential use upstairs, there are 5 levels to the alley, running from cellar (with secret tunnel for the Mayor’s covert gambling habit!) right up to the very rooftops. Find meeting places, balconies, roof gardens, latrines-a-plenty, and even feathered friends!

You can tell a lot about the city by its thoroughfares, and anyone innocently entering Cornflower Alley at one end will emerge dazed and bewildered at the other, wondering where their coin purses have gone – whether emptied in the copious selection of shops selling toothsome treats, magical supplies, armour and weapons, beer and bacon, or pilfered by felonious thugs skulking in the shadows (surely soon to be visiting the town stocks or cells).

&nbsp;

Buildings include:

* The Grand Inn

* Butcher’s shop

* Baker’s shop

* Alchemist

* Magic shop

* Town Hall (with hidden passage!)

* Grocer & Florist

* Library

* Smithy

* Jail + stocks

* The Wonky Tavern

* Abandoned Building (former toy shop)

Husband is a big espresso drinker too. The Spinn is so temperamental and we need to replace it and are not sure which direction to go next. Price is a factor but we are definitely willing to splurge for the right machine. I am seeing such mixed reviews on the brevilles and other machines with built in grinders but i work full time and have these kids so i dont have a lot of time to make my coffee in the morning, so i like the idea of the grinder built in.

Please help, my life depends on this. My father has been abusing my mother, sister and I for years. It’s on and off. He’s been physically, mentally, verbally (for my mom - maybe even sexually before we were born) many times. He mellows down and flies back into a rage, it’s unpredictable and like living near an active volcano, you never know what’ll set it off. 

Context: Last week, at 3 in the afternoon after my mom had finished making lunch, feeding everyone and finished all house chores, she finally came to her room to rest. Mom and I were sleeping and when he woke up, barged into the room and demanded mom make another cup of coffee for him. I got mad and said “she just slept”. He got mad, said something mean and left. Two days later when he was leaving for a trip he yelled at us again for not helping him pack and cursed us a lot. We are in his parents house for my grandfather’s 6 month death anniversary rites. He just came here from a trip and threatened to hurt my mom in front of me and verbally abused her a lot. We’ll leave for our house in two days and I’m scared of what he’ll do to my mom after we’re alone in our home. 

There is no one to protect or help her. We can’t go to the police, he’s too influential and my mom will cares too much about our reputation. Please tell me a way to food poison him so he gets sick and won’t hurt her. I’m not even joking, I’m an adult and I know the full consequences of my actions. I don’t want to hurt him, I just want to protect my mother and this is the only way. If he gets sick and we nurse him, his anger will cool down and everything will be normal. Please don’t suggest any other measures like NGOS, police. This is the only way I can save my mom and I. I’m begging for help. ",1,1752169751.0,abusiveparents,0,1.0,False

I (25f) may have ruined my relationship w my cousin, Mel  (23f). For background, We didn’t grow up near each other. There’s a history of Southern American Aristocratic Stienbeck-esque history of drama in our family. But my cousins and I thought we would never be like that. Mel, her older sister, and I started getting closer when they moved back Ito the area in early HS. We would hang out at holidays, go on adventures, and all had similar interests. As we got older, I focused on college and moved away. I tried to stay in touch, asking if we could hang out when we were in town and trying to stay current with her interest and her goals. I will admit I was really bad at planning in HS and college. My life was a mess and I changed majors, moved away, and was working my a$$ off. But I always tried to stay in contact with them.

 There was a time in HS when Mel and I made plans to get coffee but I wasn’t able to make it because my mom had made plans that I didn’t know about. I told my cousin I wasn’t able to make it and I was sorry, but I never realized how much that really hurt her. Mel never told me until years later when she blew up at me one time. My life has been full of changing and cancelled plans. With my busy family, that’s how life worked. You just move on and try again another time, it’s nothing personal. I never realized that other people and their cultures were different with these instances, at 15 years old. Eventually, I went to college 2 hours away and then got a job 3 hours away. So, we all started to grow apart. I still texted and sent memes but we never really hung out. 

Jumping back to the present, I lost my job in the city I’d been in for the last 2 years post-college and decided to move home to where my cousins were. I’m working 2 jobs, had to move twice (into my folks and then into my apartment), and I’m still trying to apply for another big-girl job. Days are blurring together as I work until midnight and then get up at 5 am for my shifts. But I was/am so excited to spend time with the people I grew up with and hopefully grow closer. 

This is where I might be the a-hole. I’d hadn’t seen Mel in about 6 months. I’d been reaching out trying to get coffee. The week of her birthday came up and I missed the exact day (despite it being in my google calendar). But I did reach out to tell her Happy B-day, that I loved her and hoped she’d had a good day and I wanted to see her. She BLEW UP at me. She said that I’d been given 2 reminders about her b-day (I have no idea what those reminders were) and that my whole family had forgot about her for 3 years. (I didn’t know this, but I know I did say happy b-day a few days late last year too). She said she “knew where I stood” and didn’t want anything from me and to F off. All she’d wanted was a text or a call. I felt my heart break. I had no idea she felt this way. I apologized saying that I messed up and I’ll give her space; that I’ll always want to try again and I’ll be here if she needs anything. 

 Birthdays have never meant too much to me. I’m an only child so growing up was different for me, I guess. I never understood the concept of having one day just for me. If anything, my birthday was an excuse to hang out with friends and connect. I had my 25th this year and didn’t want anything fancy or a big party, I just wanted to see the people I cared about in approximately a 2 week radius of my birthday. I don’t want presents half the time bc I have everything I need. Life is hard & crazy and it’s just a blessing to have such good people in my life. Now, Mel also hadn’t reached out to me in about 3-4 years. Not for my birthday, not to ask how I’m doing, not to make plans. Nothing. That’s okay. She’s family, and I still love her. She’s busy too. Our interactions were always positive at holidays. I genuinely care if she’s happy and doing well and I want to know about her life. But I see now that she has an entirely different culture and attitude. I wish she had told me just how much it would mean to her. 

I don’t know what to do to make it right. Presents are too shallow. I’m thinking of giving her more space and then texting her once a month saying I’m sorry and I care about her and I’m always willing to try again. I’m going to be honest, I’m kinda hurt that Mel never even came to me in all those years to say anything. And now suddenly she’s blowing up and cutting everything off? I thought we were okay. She never said a single thing to me saying she was upset or hurt or what she wanted. Was she faking and lying to me every time we hung out at holidays? Does she not think I’m trustworthy or safe enough to communicate her feelings to? Does she want me to stop trying to have a relationship with her? But at the end of the day, I understand that she is hurt now and I want to make it up to her. AITA?",1,1752169696.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

First of all I want to thank (again) for those who helped me with your kind words and encouragement to keep fighting, to keep trying and essentially, not giving up. It amazes me how just plain words on a screen can materialize into so much power and energy. You all saved me during one of (if not the most) direst moments in my life.

I have been studying non stop for the interview I got last Wednesday. Up all night until 4 AM, wake up early to keep going. Chugging coffee and avoiding the ""bank calls"".

The stress accumulated quickly in my head and despite my best efforts to keep myself calm and positive, I succumbed to several panic attacks during the week.

My wife is not doing great. Although she's staying with her parents right now, she has been worried sick about the situation and I think she's losing hope on her husband to fulfill his promise to always ""provide"" for her and for our family.

During the last interview I had a small panic attack and I almost left the call. I apologized and went to the bathroom and washed my face. Clock's ticking.

When I got back I continued the interview and I gave everything I had in me. I said thanks. Asked a couple of questions. I remember saying ""... regardless of the outcome, I enjoyed it, please thank the recruiting team for this opportunity"". Like if It would help in my begging to be considered for a job. Anything.

I woke up today feeling a bit numb. I no longer have other chances and this was the last one. I haven heard anything from the interview that I got on monday.

""Ding"" Gmail

""COMPANY. INC - Dear {myname} we..."" The notification is cut by the size of my phone.

I took a walk with my dogs. They have waiting patient for me to wake up and spend our morning routine. I'm wearing my dirtiest sweatpants. Microwaved coffee from yesterday or maybe monday's brew I think. I sit on my bench. My smallest dog comforts me and rubs her head against my leg. She wants the scrathies. 

""Allright silly, move along""

""COMPANY. INC - Dear {myname} we were impressed by your performance during the interview and we would love you to become a {worker title} at COMPANY. INC. Our benefits package, if you were to accept this offer, include ... ""

1lwj6ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lwj6ry/they_told_us_to_stay_inside_we_should_not_have/,They Told Us to Stay Inside. We Should Not Have Listened,"The weekend it all began, I was completely disconnected. I'd decided to stay home, away from my phone, social media, everything. Just me, the couch, hot coffee, and the sound of soft rain against the window. Red Pine Falls was always like that on weekends: quiet, a bit forgotten, moving at its usual slow pace. I lived in an old apartment building, the kind that felt stuck in time. My neighbors were easygoing folks. The lady in 104 walked her dog every morning. The kid from B13 was always skateboarding in the parking lot. A couple down the street would fight loudly but always made up the next day.

It was Sunday when I saw the alert. I didn't hear a sound. I just noticed a shift in the living room light, like something had flickered. I looked at the TV, which was off, and it had turned on by itself. The screen displayed a red background with static white letters:

""EMERGENCY ALERT: DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOME. REMAIN DISCONNECTED. AVOID WINDOWS. AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.""

I grabbed my cell phone by reflex. It showed the exact same message. Same color, same font. No sound, no sirens, no explanation. Just that text.

My first reaction was to laugh. It seemed like a system error. Maybe a poorly programmed test. The government often runs simulations, right? Especially in small towns like ours. But when I tried to change the channel, the TV froze. The power button didn't work. My phone also froze. The screen flickered, then went back to the alert. I restarted it, but the same warning reappeared, as if it were imprinted on the system itself.

I looked out the window, expecting to see some movement, some collective response. But everything was the same. A few lights on in the surrounding buildings, but no one on the street. Not even the sound of the lady calling her dog, or the skateboarder, or the couple arguing. Just a thick silence, as if the world was holding its breath.

I went back to the couch, phone still in hand. I tried to open any app, but nothing worked. Everything was frozen. I turned on the old radio on the shelf. As soon as it powered up, the announcer's voice was interrupted, and the same alert phrase began to repeat, like a soft, emotionless mantra.

""Do not leave your home. Remain disconnected. Avoid windows.""

I switched it off immediately. From that moment on, everything in me wanted to say it was just a technical glitch, a coincidence… but something was wrong. Very wrong.

The next morning, the first thing I noticed was the silence. Not a common silence — it was something heavier, as if sound had been drained from the town. Even the birds weren't singing. I got up slowly, opened the window, and looked outside. The sky was cloudy, but no sign of rain. The streets were clean, the houses exactly as they always were, but no one in sight. No cars, no doors opening, no footsteps on the pavement. It seemed like everyone had simply vanished or decided, at the same time, to stay home. Even the lady from 104’s dog wasn't barking anymore.

The strangest thing was that the lights in most houses were still on, even in the morning. As if people were still inside — just motionless. I watched for a few minutes, waiting for some movement. When I noticed a curtain moving in the apartment across the way, I felt a surge of relief. But the relief was short-lived. The curtain moved with exaggerated slowness, as if being pulled by someone who wasn't quite sure what they were doing. And then, through the glass, I saw a face. It was Mr. Larkin, from 202. He was just staring blankly at the sky, unblinking, expressionless. The curtain slowly dropped back down, and the window was closed.

I went back inside and tried to make a call. I called my sister, then my friend Mark, and then the city's main line. All the numbers rang, but none answered. Until one call connected. My sister's name appeared on the cell phone screen. I answered immediately. ""Hello?"" Silence. Then a voice emerged, but it wasn't hers. It was low, soft, strangely calm.

""Everything's fine now. Stay home. Await instructions.""

I hung up immediately. I don't know why it scared me so much. It wasn't a threat. It was the tone. Too calm, too controlled, as if someone had been trained to soothe me. But I wasn't calm. And something told me I shouldn't be.

Shortly after, I heard footsteps in the hallway. I went to the door and looked through the peephole. It was the teenager from B13, the skateboard kid. But he didn't have his skateboard with him. He just walked slowly down the hall, looking at each door. He reached mine, paused for a few seconds, and then whispered something too low for me to understand. Then he continued walking to the end of the hall and disappeared down the stairs. I opened the door slightly and called out to him, but he didn't respond. He didn't even turn his head.

That night was even stranger. The streetlights flickered, like a bulb about to burn out. In a moment of nervousness, I yelled out the window, asking if anyone knew what was happening. No answer. But, in the distance, I heard the sound of a door opening. And then another. Suddenly, all over the block, several doors slowly began to open. People emerged from their homes, but they didn't speak, they didn't interact. They just walked silently into the street, looking up, at nothing, as if they were waiting for something to fall from the sky.

There was Mr. Larkin, standing in the middle of the street, still with that empty expression. The lady from 104 was beside him, with her dog — which was now lying motionless, eyes open. The teenager was there too. No one moved anymore. I stood there, watching, my heart pounding. And then, as if they'd received an invisible command, they all went back inside at the same time.

I closed the curtains, turned off the lights, and sat on the kitchen floor. Something was happening, and it wasn't just a simple alert. No one seemed scared — and that's what bothered me the most. It was as if they had accepted a new rule, a new logic. And I was the only one who still hadn't figured out what it was.

I woke up the next day with a strange feeling in my body. It wasn't pain, or tiredness, but a kind of weight on my shoulders, as if the air was denser. The ceiling seemed lower. The silence was no longer strange; it was the new normal. I got out of bed with difficulty, drank some coffee that tasted like paper, and went to the door. When I tried to turn the doorknob, it wouldn't budge. I tried again, harder. Nothing. It was locked from the outside.

This made no sense. There was no lock on the outside of the door. At least, not that I knew of. I pushed, banged, forced. Nothing gave way. I went to the living room window and tried to open it, but I noticed the glass was different. It didn't reflect properly. It was as if a film had been glued to the outside. I grabbed a hammer from the cabinet and hit it hard. The glass cracked, then broke, and a cold wind rushed through the opening. But the air… it had a strange smell. It wasn't pollution, or mold. It was sweet, almost perfumed, but artificial. A smell that made everything seem too clean, as if the world had been forcibly sanitized.

I looked out through the cracks and saw the mailman. He walked slowly, with regular steps, carrying nothing in his hands. He passed the mailboxes, but didn't put anything in any of them. He just walked to the end of the street and stopped. He stood there, looking at nothing. I kept watching until he turned and came back the same way, at the same pace. As he passed my window, he looked directly at me. Not with surprise, or shock. He just stared as if I were the strange one in this story.

I closed the window and went to the kitchen. I turned on the microwave to heat up some food, but the panel showed something strange: instead of numbers or functions, the same alert message appeared. The words were repeating:

""Remain at home. Await instructions. Everything's fine now.""

I turned the appliance off immediately. I looked around. The TV was off, but flickering, as if trying to turn on. My laptop no longer powered up. The radio played static, with small whispers I couldn't identify.

I went to the door again. The doorknob still locked. I began to wonder if someone had done that during the night. But who? And why? I grabbed a kitchen knife, not for protection, but because the idea of being trapped in my own home really started to weigh on me. Not because of the lack of freedom itself, but because of the absence of any explanation.

Later, I heard noises in the hallway. Slow footsteps. Someone whispering. I approached the door and listened intently. The voice repeated, almost like a child learning a new phrase: ""Everything's fine now. You're safe.""

I went to the peephole. It was the woman from 103. She was going from door to door, pressing her forehead against the wood and saying those words softly. Then she would smile and continue. Her face seemed too serene, as if she had achieved some forced peace. When she reached my door, she did the same — said the words, pressed her head, and stayed there for a minute. Quiet. Until she left.

I stood motionless for a long time. When I finally managed to get off the floor, I noticed something even more unsettling. All the mirrors in the house — in the bathroom, the living room, and even on the back of the closet door — were fogged up. No windows had condensation. There was no steam. But the mirrors looked like they had been touched. And in the center of each, there was a mark… as if someone had written a single phrase with their finger: ""Stay home.""

It was as if the message was trying to get inside me in every possible way. Through the screen. Through the sound. Through the smell. Now even through reflection.

I didn't sleep that night. The world outside seemed mute. And inside me, something was starting to stir. It wasn't exactly fear. It was doubt. As if a part of my mind was starting to think… that maybe, just maybe, they were right. And that I really should just… stay home.

I was starting to lose track of time. Hours no longer passed as before. The sky maintained that grayish hue, neither night nor day, as if the world had been put on standby. Food was running out. The refrigerator light flickered, as if even the electricity was afraid to stay on. I no longer received new alerts, but the original message kept flashing on all the devices that still worked. Even the ones that were off. It had become a kind of ghost.

On the fourth night, I heard knocking on the kitchen window. Three dry taps. Then, silence. I couldn't see anyone outside. Through the crack, I could only see the tall weeds of the community garden and the motionless outline of an abandoned car. But there was something about that knocking. It wasn't random. It was… human. Measured. As if it was being used to get my attention, not to scare me.

The next morning, a sheet of paper was pushed under my door. It was a handwritten letter, with shaky letters. It said: ""If you still think for yourself, come down to the basement of Block C. Bring paper. No devices.""

It was signed only with a name: Clarke.

I thought of a thousand ways this could be a trap. But in the end, the idea of staying there, trapped and alone, was worse. I exited through the laundry room window, which was in the back and still had a simple latch. I walked through the back of the buildings, keeping my head down. The silence followed me, but it was an oppressive silence, full of invisible eyes. I saw some people through the windows — empty faces, all looking inside their own homes. As if they had given up on the world.

I reached Block C, where the basement was partially open, with a rock propping the door. I went down the stairs cautiously, and there, in the dark, I found Clarke. A thin man, unshaven, wearing an old military coat and holding a flashlight. He didn't look dangerous. But he didn't look calm either.

He led me to a corner of the basement, where three others were sitting on the floor with pads of paper, writing. Clarke spoke softly, as if even the walls there could hear.

""You saw the alert, right?""

""Yes.""

""Then you're already compromised. But maybe there's still time.""

I asked what he meant by ""compromised."" And that's when he explained everything. The alert we received wasn't a warning message. It wasn't meant to protect us. It was the beginning. The entry. The vector.

""They designed the alert to seem safe. Cold, direct, clean. But it was designed to fix itself in the mind. Repetition, color, tone. It wasn't sent to inform. It was sent to condition.""

He showed me a portable radio that had been disassembled. The wires were black, as if burned.

""Every device that receives the signal is corroded. But not physically. The corrosion is mental. First you agree to stay home. Then you agree not to look out the window. Then you agree that you don't need to go out anymore. Until the thought of going out doesn't even exist.""

A woman in the group, with hollow eyes and trembling fingers, said her husband started repeating phrases a week before the alert. She said he had already ""received the call."" And that after that, he just smiled and said everything was better now.

Clarke showed me hand-drawn images, representing signal patterns — spiral waves, truncated texts.

""These shapes repeat in the visual alerts. They get stuck in the brain like a virus. Most people accept it. Some, like us, resist. But for how long?""

I remained silent. My stomach churned. The alert, which until then I had treated as a strange warning, was part of the contamination. There were no sirens because the threat wasn't external. It was inside everyone's head. Planted there with a phrase and a color.

Before leaving, Clarke handed me a sheet of paper with notes. There was a hand-drawn map marking the center of town, where an old emergency transmission truck was located. According to him, that's where the signals were coming from.

""If you can shut that down, maybe there'll be time for the few who still resist.""

""What about you?"" I asked.

""I've seen the alert for too long.""

I returned home by the same route, avoiding the glazed eyes of those peeking through windows. Upon arrival, I closed all the curtains, turned off all remaining appliances, and sat on the floor, looking at the crumpled paper in my hands.

For the first time, I felt there was something bigger than just a system error. And that my mind had been molding for days — perhaps from the very first moment I looked at that red screen. But now, I knew.

In the following days, I started to notice that something inside me was changing. It wasn't physical. My body was still the same; I still looked at myself in the mirror with that expression of accumulated tiredness. But my thoughts… they began to repeat themselves. I noticed patterns in my own sentences. I would think something and, seconds later, repeat it in a low voice, as if trying to convince myself. Sometimes, I would write something in the notebook Clarke gave me, and when I reread it, it felt like it wasn't me who wrote it.

The words came too easily. ""Stay home. Everything's fine now. Avoid windows."" I didn't want to think about it, but the thoughts came on their own, like an echo. I started to distrust myself. My own mind. And that's the kind of fear you can't run from.

One night, I woke up with the sensation of being watched. The hallway light was on, even though I remembered turning it off. I went there and saw wet footprints on the floor. Small, like bare feet. They went from the front door to the bathroom. I followed slowly, my heart pounding. The bathroom was empty, but the mirror was fogged up — and in the center, someone had written with their finger: ""You're almost ready.""

That night, I didn't go back to sleep. I sat on the bedroom floor with the flashlight on, the kitchen knife beside me, and the notebook open. I forced myself to write something different. I tried to remember my sister's name, the town where I was born, my favorite food. But the more I tried, the emptier everything seemed. The memories were there, but they crumbled in the details. Like dreams told too late. It was as if the parts that made me up were being deleted one by one.

The next day, I decided to go back to the basement, to look for Clarke. The door was ajar, as before, but no one was there. The place seemed abandoned for days, even though I knew I had been there a short time ago. On the floor, only a sheet of paper with a red spiral drawing. On the back, a phrase written in red pen: ""The more you look, the more it understands you.""

From then on, I began to question if Clarke had even existed. If that group of people was really there. Or if my mind, in an attempt to protect itself, created a fantasy of resistance to keep me functioning. But the map was still with me. The notes too. And the anguish wasn't a product of imagination. That, I knew.

On the way back, I saw a man standing in front of the building, looking at the sky. He was wearing a delivery uniform, completely dirty. His head was tilted back at a strange angle, as if his neck had locked up. The most disturbing thing was that he was smiling. Not aggressively. It was a serene, calm smile. Like someone who fully accepts what is about to happen. He slowly turned his head and looked at me. He didn't say anything. But the smile widened.

I ran up the stairs, locked the door with all the furniture I could drag, and locked myself in the bathroom. I was breathing too fast. My hands were shaking. My thoughts were jumbled. I looked in the mirror and tried to repeat my name out loud. I couldn't. My mouth opened, but no words came out. Just that feeling that the name no longer belonged to me. I was someone, but I didn't know who. And the part of me that knew… was already gone.

In the following hours, I heard knocking on the door. It was rhythmic, soft, like the knocking on the window days earlier. And between each knock, a soft voice said: ""You're ready now. Let me in.""

The voice sounded like my sister's. Or maybe my mother's. Or maybe my own. I can't tell. But it was familiar. And that's what scared me the most.

I spent the rest of the night in absolute silence, trying not to think, not to hear, not to feel. But even with my eyes closed, I saw flickering images — the red background, the white letters, the repeated message. And when I opened my eyes, I realized I had written on the floor with charcoal from the stove: ""Everything's better now.""

I didn't remember doing that. But the handwriting was mine. Or, at least, it was similar enough.

When dawn broke, the sky seemed even more wrong. The light had no defined color, as if the sun was trying to rise, but something was blocking the last part of the morning. Time didn't pass correctly. My wrist watch spun the numbers as if it were in test mode. My cell phone battery had finally died. Even the silence seemed denser.

I still had the map in my hands. The signal truck was marked with a circle in the center of Red Pine Falls, in front of the old radio station building. It was far, and the path was exposed. But if I didn't go, I already knew my fate: to become another smiling body staring at the sky.

I grabbed the notebook, a flashlight, a knife, and the remaining water bottle. I left through the back laundry room, the same way as before. The streets were empty, but not like an ordinary night. It was a programmed absence. As if someone had emptied the world so I would have no one to talk to.

Halfway there, I saw a child standing on the sidewalk, alone. She was looking at the pavement, hands behind her back, humming something without a melody. When I passed her, she stopped singing. She looked at me and said in a low voice: ""You're going there, aren't you? They know.""

And then she went back to singing. I stood paralyzed for a few seconds. I tried to ask who ""they"" were, but she just turned and went into the house next door, without rushing.

I kept walking, and the closer I got to the center of town, the more I felt like I was walking inside a glass corridor. The store windows displayed mannequins facing outwards, all with their faces covered by red cloths. This wasn't normal. This wasn't part of the decor. It had been placed there afterwards. By someone. Or by something that wanted to see me pass by.

Finally, I reached the spot indicated on the map. The old radio station was locked, but behind it, in the empty lot, was the truck. A military vehicle, gray, without license plates. The windows were dark and the engine was off. Even so, the chassis vibrated, as if some machine inside was still operating. On the side, an LED panel flashed with the same message:

""Remain at home. Await instructions.""

I approached slowly, my eyes fixed on the words. The feeling of being pulled was real. Not physically, but as if my mind wanted to get closer, understand, obey. When I put my hand on the doorknob, I heard a voice behind me.

""Don't touch that.""

I turned and saw a man, leaning against a wall, holding an iron bar. His face was dirty, his gaze tired. He was one of the locals I used to see at the market, but I couldn't remember his name. He approached.

""Can you still think?""

I nodded, unsure if it was true.

""Then we have a chance.""

His name was Martin. He had been hiding in the city center's service tunnels, trying to track the signal. He told me more people had tried to destroy that truck, but they couldn't even get close. Most gave up halfway. Others simply… stopped.

With his help, we opened the back of the vehicle. Inside, it was worse than I imagined. There was no one, but there were screens. Many screens. And all of them displayed faces. Hundreds of faces, of the town's residents, repeating synchronized phrases. Some screens showed house rooms, others showed empty streets. It was as if the truck was watching the entire town, recording every word spoken, every window closed.

Martin started destroying the wires with the iron bar while I looked for the generator. The machine trembled, as if trying to resist. When I finally cut the power cables, the screens flickered and began to shut down one by one. The sound of the voices diminished to just a whisper, and then, silence. But it wasn't the end.

Martin stopped moving. He stood still in the middle of the truck bed, looking at the last screen still on. It was his face. But he was smiling.

He fell to the ground shortly after. No scream, no struggle. He just fell. I rushed to him, but he had no pulse. His face still showed that serene smile. For a second, I thought I was smiling too. I put my hand on my face. It was normal. But the thought… the thought lingered.

I got out of there as fast as I could, running through increasingly distorted streets. The houses seemed tilted. The trees seemed to be watching me. And the feeling of being followed never left me. When I finally reached the edge of the town, I no longer knew if I had managed to escape the signal… or if I was just carrying it with me.

I stayed out of town for a while. Hidden in an abandoned shed on the outskirts of Red Pine Falls, eating the little I had saved and drinking rainwater. I thought maybe I had won, that the destroyed truck meant the end of the signal. But every night I heard something. Not outside the shed. Inside me. Low voices, repeating the same thing. Not like a thought. It was deeper than that. As if my mind had been re-recorded by a program that was still running in the background.

During the third day in that shelter, I noticed a red light flashing in the sky. It was a drone. Not a military one. Small, commercial. It came from the north, circled my position, and then left. The next day, another appeared. It wasn't a coincidence. They were still monitoring. They were still searching.

That's when I understood: the truck wasn't the source. It was just one of the transmitters. Like one tower among many. The central hub was still active. And the hub was what fed the voices. I went back.

I knew it was a stupid decision. But I needed to know where it was coming from. I walked back through the forest to the west side of town. What I saw paralyzed me. Red Pine Falls wasn't abandoned. On the contrary — it seemed… in order. The lights in the houses were all on. The curtains perfectly aligned. Some children were playing on the sidewalk. But the way they moved was too artificial. As if every gesture had been rehearsed. As if every resident was living a perfect simulation of their old life. And everyone was smiling.

I found what I was looking for in the old part of town, near the disused train tracks. An emergency operations center had been set up in an old school. Inside, through a broken window, I saw cables, panels, antennas. And a room full of people. They were sitting in chairs, side by side, with headphones and monitors on. Their eyes were open, but unblinking. Some mumbled nonsense words. Others just took a deep breath and repeated: ""You're safe now.""

There were no supervisors. No security. Just them, functioning like pieces of a living machine. I walked among them. None reacted. And in the center of the room, a single screen displayed an aerial view of Red Pine Falls. And at the bottom of the screen, a phrase silently rotated: ""Stable connection. Active transmission.""

I didn't know what to do. Unplug cables? Destroy equipment? Part of me just wanted to run. But another part… wanted to sit there too. Put on the headphones. Be silent. Stop feeling. Stop being. But I forced myself to leave.

On the way back, I saw my own face reflected in a storefront. I was sweaty, pale, but something was wrong. My eyes… weren't blinking. And there was a slight smile at the corner of my mouth. The same smile I saw on the mailman. On the delivery guy. On the child. Maybe I had already passed the point of no return.

I fled the town that same night. Not by road, nor by the known trails. I cut through the dense woods, following only instinct and what was left of my free will. I walked for hours until the sound disappeared. Not the sound of the town — the sound inside my head.

I found shelter in an abandoned cabin in the mountains. Since then, I avoid any electronic devices. I use candles, write by hand, eat what I can hunt or grow. I don't connect with anyone. Sometimes I see smoke on the horizon. Sometimes I hear voices that sound human, but I'm not sure. I never go to them.

Six months have passed. The signal is gone, but not the thoughts. I still dream of the phrase. I still wake up with the feeling that I'm smiling, even when I'm not. Sometimes I forget my name for a few minutes. Sometimes I catch myself repeating phrases I didn't write.

The world didn't end. But it changed. Red Pine Falls was just a test site. An experiment. Perhaps other places have already been ""corrected."" Perhaps this is the new way to control people — not with force, but with quiet obedience. A screen. A soft voice. An order that sounds like care.

If you saw the alert, even for a second… it might already be too late.",3,1752169637.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1lwj3rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lwj3rn/explore_if_bunn_csb2b_speed_brew_10cup_coffee/,Explore if BUNN CSB2B Speed Brew 10-Cup Coffee Maker Delivers Perfection Review,"The **BUNN 52700.0002 CSB2B Speed Brew Elite 10-Cup Coffee Maker** has been a staple on my kitchen counter for weeks now, and after countless pots of coffee, I feel ready to give an honest breakdown of my experience. It's advertised as one of the fastest home coffee makers in America, and I was curious to see if it could walk the talk—or brew the coffee, in this case. While it delivers on many fronts, there are definitely some nuances to consider before making it your go-to brewing machine.

**Sleek Design That Fits Most Kitchens**  
This machine isn't just about speed; it looks good doing its job. The matte black finish paired with polished stainless steel accents gives it a modern aesthetic that complements any kitchen setup. At 7.7 inches deep, 12.7 inches wide, and 13.8 inches tall, the coffee maker doesn't hog counter space, yet it’s large enough to handle 10 cups of coffee. The drip-free carafe design is an underrated highlight. Not a single stray coffee drop ends up on the counter, and trust me, I tested this feature vigorously on many rushed mornings. The funnel design is taller than most others on the market, specifically accommodating BUNN's slightly larger paper filters.  

**Exclusive Features That Stand Out**  
The standout feature for me has to be the internal commercial-grade stainless steel hot water tank. Unlike other traditional coffee makers, which only heat water when you press start, this one keeps 70 ounces of water consistently hot, so brewing is immediate. No waiting for the water to “burp” its way to readiness. Additionally, the switch-activated warming plate does a commendable job of keeping the coffee at an ideal temperature without scorching it. It also features a particularly user-friendly pour-in bowl with a clear water level indicator, streamlining the entire coffee prep process.  
[Check BUNN 52700.0002 CSB2B Speed Brew Elite price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0792t7rw1/)

**Performance and Speed: Is It Really That Fast?**  
This coffee maker boasts a brewing time of just four minutes for a full pot, cutting the typical wait in half. I was skeptical at first, and I even timed it—four minutes flat, just as promised. The machine uses a commercial-style multi-stream spray head that evenly saturates your coffee grounds, ensuring no area is left dry. The flavor extraction is noticeably better compared to other machines in this price range. I tested it on a variety of grinds and beans, from light roast blends to boutique dark roasts, and it consistently delivered café-quality flavor in my cup.

**The Benefits of Using This Coffee Maker**  
- Brews a full pot of coffee in just 4 minutes.
- Internal hot water tank ensures it's always ready to brew.  
- Drip-free carafe prevents messes during pouring.
- Stylish matte black finish suits modern kitchens.
- Even water distribution maximizes flavor extraction.  

**What Could Be Improved**  
As much as I enjoyed its performance, there are a few hurdles that need mentioning:  
- Always having the machine plugged in may not appeal to everyone.  
- Takes up a bit more counter space than compact models.  
- The larger paper filters required might not be readily available at every store.  

**Competing Products in the Same Space**  
Comparing this machine to its competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and the Technivorm Moccamaster, it holds its own due to its speed. The DCC-3200 offers more customization options for brewing strength but can’t match the BUNN’s brewing speed. On the flip side, the Technivorm Moccamaster arguably edges out in build quality and precision but comes with a steeper price tag. BUNN’s key strengths lie in its robust brewing capability and fail-proof carafe, even if the other models offer features like adjustable temperature or more compact designs.

**Smart Spending: Pinpointing the Value**  
The value this coffee maker provides lies in its speed and simplicity. You’re paying not just for coffee but for the convenience of fast brewing paired with top-notch durability. It’s certainly not the cheapest option out there, but if you’re an impatient coffee drinker like me, waiting for morning fuel is a thing of the past. Its three-year warranty only sweetens the deal, showing that this machine is built to last.

1lwj2hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/1lwj2hw/im_so_fucking_done_with_culture_this_is_gonna_be/,I'm so fucking done with culture. This is gonna be long. Bear with me because I'm just a girl with anger issues.,"First off, it's absolutely infuriating that a woman's ambition is still viewed with suspicion, if not outright disdain. As if having dreams and aspirations beyond a culturally prescribed role is some kind of defect. I am a person, a complete individual with my own intellect, my own desires to achieve something meaningful with my life. I feel that I was made for more than just being a wife and mother. And let's be crystal clear: there is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with choosing to be a wife and mother. It's a noble path for those who genuinely desire it. The problem, the deep seated, suffocating problem, is the cultural dictate that this is the *only* valid path for women. That anything beyond domesticity is seen as an affront, an ""imitation of men,"" and therefore ""haram."" Like be so fucking for real. 

  
And then there's the constant conversation that inexplicably revolves around a hypothetical husband. Every aspect of my future, my present, my very being, seems to be filtered through the lens of a man who doesn't even exist yet. ""Enjoy sleeping till 11 AM because your husband would not let you."" What kind of dystopian future are we imagining here? If a hypothetical partner dictates my sleep schedule to that extent, then divorce is clearly on the table before the marriage even begins. It's a ridiculous, controlling fantasy projected onto my life. Or my favorite: ""How can you not cook yet? Who is gonna feed your husband?"" I'm sorry, did I miss the memo where we reverted to marrying infants? Because last I checked, it's haram to marry a child. Adults, ideally, are capable of feeding themselves, or at least sharing the responsibility. This isn't about me acquiring a domestic skill. It's about perpetuating a gendered expectation that my primary function is to serve another person. It's degrading and utterly irrelevant to my actual life goals.

On top of all of this, there's the pervasive, insidious notion that women, especially those in my age group (college-aged), are inherently lustful, practically walking temptations. It's an exhausting, demeaning narrative. My parents, bless their hearts, are getting daily calls from relatives (relatives I didn't even know existed) all to warn them that I'm going to commit *zina* by daring to reside in a college dorm. Like, seriously? Does it look like I have a moment to spare for anything beyond my textbooks? I'm currently dual-majoring in two of the most rigorous fields college offers. Hell, my academic calendar is already filled to the brim with career fairs and workshops because surprise surprise, some women go to college because they want a CAREER. So, while I appreciate the *concern* for my chastity, the audacity to call my parents and declare, with absolute certainty, that I'm going to be promiscuous is beyond unhinged. Please, for the love of all that is holy, find a hobby. Pick up knitting, learn a new language, literally anything other than obsessing over my hypothetical sexual escapades.

And let's address the profound hypocrisy embedded in these concerns. Just the other day, my grandmother, a woman with a PhD in psychology and a distinguished career as a researcher, called my mom and said, ""Women are more lustful than men. Your daughter is gonna have an affair why did u send her away?"" Grandma, with all due respect to your academic credentials, that's a truly baffling statement coming from someone who supposedly understands human behavior. You, of all people, should know that while individual libidos vary, men statistically exhibit far less self-control when it comes to acting on their desires. Sure, some women may have a higher drive, but the data, the actual research, points to a clear trend of men being more likely to ""act out"" on their feelings and impulses. And let's be realistic: if, hypothetically, I were to have an affair, my physical location is utterly irrelevant. I could have one at my college, two hours away from home, or I could have one at the coffee shop 30 minutes away. The idea that distance somehow protects my ""chastity"" is as outdated as the notion that women are the sole purveyors of lust. ",17,1752169372.0,Hijabis,6,0.95,False

It's being developed by a new firm called Avenew Development (founded in 2024) and seems to be targeting the new-gen buyer/investor who values shared spaces, greenery, and lifestyle features.

**Highlights:**

* 5 buildings, 11-storeys each, with shared terraces, green pockets, co-working areas
* Mix of 1, 2, and 3-bedroom apartments, plus duplexes (some up to 2950 sq ft!)
* Loaded with amenities: library, art studio, jogging track, gyms, pools, coffee shop, flower shop, dog park
* Prices not announced publicly yet, but Phase 1 (called ""MODO"") is now selling
* Handover expected in **Q1 2028**, with a **60/40 payment plan**

  
\[If any devs or agents here have more info, please chime in.\]

Honestly feels like they’re trying to blend co-living and resort-style urbanism in a very structured, almost Scandinavian way.

**Curious to hear:**

* What do you think of co-living as a model in Dubai?
* Would you invest in something like this?
* Is Dubai South finally getting interesting, or still too early?

I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. Also want to start making different types of bread/sourdough so if know anything about that I would like to learn. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck to play on the go or in loving room tv.

1lwiun0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwiun0,Pourover experiment with a Vietnamese phin brewer I bought today for 25 SEK (~$2.50),"Roughly 1:16 (11:180 g), 93°C water, 30 g bloom and 2 * 75 g pours, 21 clicks on the Comandante. About 5:30 total brew time. 

Never heard of this brewer or style until I found it earlier at a local asian grocery store. Incredibly cheap at 25 SEK. No paper filters, so there's some particles in the brewed coffee. The filter/main chamber could definitely work as a melodrip in V60 brewing, too. 

The coffee turned out a bit watery but not bitter or astringent at all, but with a surprising amount of fruitiness. Almost like a mix between V60 and French press – more body than V60, but not as many loose particles as a French press. 

Very slow drawdown, so it's like a mix between percolation and immersion brewing. 

Way better results than expected, and seems to be an awesome brewer for smaller cups (75 g/ml almost filled the chamber). I'll try to grind a bit finer next time and use even hotter water.

1lwitpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lwitpw/aita_i_ruined_my_cousins_bday/,AITA - I ruined my cousins bday?,"Throwaway acct. First time posting so please be considerate. This is going to be long, I’m sorry. 

I (25f) may have ruined my relationship w my cousin (23f). For background, We didn’t grow up near each other. There’s a history of Southern American Aristocratic Stienbeck-esque history of drama in our family. But my cousins and I thought we would never be like that. Her, her older sister, and I started getting closer when they moved back Ito the area in early HS. We would hang out at holidays, go on adventures, and all had similar interests. As we got older, I focused on college and moved away. I tried to stay in touch, asking if we could hang out when we were in town and trying to stay current with her interest and her goals. I will admit I was really bad at planning in HS and college. My life was a mess and I changed majors, moved away, and was working my a$$ off. But I always tried to stay in contact with them.

 There was a time in HS when we made plans to get coffee but I wasn’t able to make it because my mom had made plans for us that I didn’t know about. I told my cousin I wasn’t able to make it and I was sorry, but I never realized how much that really hurt her. She never told me until years later when she blew up at me one time. My life has been full of changing and cancelled plans. With my busy family, that’s how life worked. You just move on and try again another time, it’s nothing personal. I never realized that other people and their cultures were different with these instances, at 15 years old. Eventually, I went to college 2 hours away and then got a job 3 hours away. So, we all started to grow apart. I still texted and sent memes but we never really hung out. 

Jumping back to the present, I lost my job in the city I’d been in for that 2 years and decided to move home to where my cousins were. I’m working 2 jobs, had to move twice (into my folks and then into my apartment), and I’m still trying to apply for another big-girl job. Days are blurring together as I work until midnight and then get up at 5 am for my shifts. But I was/am so excited to spend time with the people I grew up with and hopefully grow closer. 

This is where I might be the a-hole. I’d hadn’t seen my cousin in about 6 months. I’d been reaching out trying to get coffee. The week of her birthday came up and I missed the exact day (despite it being in my google calendar) but I reached out to tell her Happy B-day and that I loved her and hoped she’d had a good day and I wanted to see her. She BLEW UP at me. She said that I’d been given 2 reminders about her b-day and that my whole family had forgot about her for 3 years (I didn’t know this, but I know I did say happy b-day a few days late last year too). She said she “knew where I stood” and didn’t want anything from me and to F off. All she’d wanted was a text or a call. I felt my heart break. This came out of nowhere for me. I had no idea she felt this way. I apologized saying that I messed up and I’ll give her space. I’ll always want to try again and I’ll be here if she needs anything. 

 Birthdays have never meant too much to me. I’m an only child so growing up I got a lot of attention and care from my folks. I never understood the value of having one day just for me. If anything, my birthday was an excuse to hang out with friends and connect. I had my 25th this year and didn’t want anything fancy or a big party, I just wanted to see the people I cared about in approximately a 2 week radius of my birthday. I don’t want presents half the time bc I have everything I need. Now, my cousin hadn’t reached out to me in about 3-4 years. Not for my birthday, not to ask how I’m doing, not to make plans. Nothing. That’s okay. She’s family, and I still love her. She’s busy too. Our interactions were positive at holidays. I genuinely care if she’s happy and doing well and I want to know about her life. But I see now that she has an entirely different culture and attitude. I wish she had told me that birthdays meant a lot to her. 

I don’t know what to do to make it right. I’m thinking of giving her more space and then texting her once a month saying I’m sorry and I care about her and I’m always willing to try again. I’m going to be honest, I’m kinda hurt that she never even came to me in 2 years to say anything. And now suddenly she’s blowing up and cutting everything off? I thought we were okay. She never said a single thing to me saying she was upset or hurt or what she wanted. Was she faking and lying to me every time we hung out at holidays? Does she not think I’m trustworthy or safe enough to communicate her feelings to? But at the end of the day, I understand that she is hurt now. AITA?",0,1752168804.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

Chapter 1  
  
Just a door away, the conversation in the corner of the medical wing continued.  
  
""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""  
  
The pack healer went rigid with shock.  
  
""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""  
  
""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""  
  
Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.  
  
""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""  
  
The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.  
  
""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""  
  
Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.  
  
""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""  
  
""Alpha, but—""  
  
""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""  
  
Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.  
  
""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""  
  
""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""  
  
Footsteps approached from deeper inside.  
  
I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.  
  
""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""  
  
Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.  
  
""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""  
  
His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.  
  
My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.  
  
""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""  
  
He dared to mention our pup.  
  
Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.  
  
Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.  
  
""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""  
  
""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""  
  
Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.  
  
He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.  
  
But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.  
  
""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""  
  
Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?  
  
He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.  
  
""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""  
  
""Let me help you with that.""  
  
He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.  
  
I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.  
  
As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.  
  
""Begin immediately. And...""  
  
Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.  
  
""Make sure she can’t walk again.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""  
  
""Do it!""  
  
I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.  
  
My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.  
  
Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?  
  
My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.  
  
I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:  
  
""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""  
  
When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.  
  
""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
Nothing. No sensation at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:  
  
""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.  
  
""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""  
  
I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.  
  
He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""  
  
I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.  
  
""You should rest if you're tired.""  
  
""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""  
  
Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.  
  
I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.  
  
The password worked on the first try.  
  
Annabelle's birthday.  
  
The lock screen showed their wedding photo.  
  
A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.  
  
Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.  
  
Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.  
  
All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.  
  
When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.  
  
His standard response was always the same:  
  
""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""  
  
But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.  
  
He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.  
  
Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.  
  
Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.  
  
She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.  
  
His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""  
  
They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.  
  
My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.  
  
The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.  
  
Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.  
  
Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.  
  
I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.  
  
But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.  
  
Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.  
  
In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.  
  
The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.  
  
I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.  
  
I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.  
  
Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...  
  
I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.  
  
Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:  
  
""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""  
  
""I'm fine. I want to go home.""  
  
Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.  
  
""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""  
  
I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.  
  
That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.  
  
I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.  
  
Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.  
  
The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.  
  
""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""  
  
""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""  
  
""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""  
  
Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:  
  
""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""  
  
""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""  
  
I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.  
  
Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.  
  
She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.  
  
Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.  
  
But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.  
  
Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.  
  
If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.  
  
Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.  
  
In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.  
  
Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:  
  
""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""  
  
Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:  
  
""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""  
  
""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""  
  
She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.  
  
I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

This is how the book starts:

>YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AT dawn and turn in the cool bedsheets. A few feet above your head, affixed to the top of the roof, a layer of solar panels blinks in the morning sun. Their power mixes with electricity pulled from several dean energy sources-towering wind turbines to the east, small nuclear power plants to the north, deep geothermal wells to the south. Forty years ago, your parents cooled their bedrooms with joules dredged out of coal mines and oil pits. They mined rocks and burned them, coating their lungs in the byproducts. They encased their world— your world—in a chemical heat trap. Today, that seems barbaric. You live in a cocoon of energy so dean it barely leaves a carbon trace and so cheap you can scarcely find it on your monthly bill.

>The year is 2050.

>You walk to the kitchen to turn on the sink. Water from the ocean pours out of the faucet. It's fresh and clear, piped from a desalination plant. These facilities use microbial membranes to squeeze out the ocean salt. Today, they provide more than half of the country's fresh used water. Previously overtaxed rivers, such as the Colorado, have surged back now that we don't rely on them to irrigate our farms and fill our coffee mugs. In Phoenix and Las Vegas, previously parched cities are erupting in green foliage.

>You open the refrigerator. In the fruit and vegetable drawer are apples, tomatoes, and an eggplant, shipped from the nearest farm, mere miles away. These crops don't grow horizontally, across fields. They grow vertically on tiered shelves inside a tall greenhouse. Banks of LED lights deliver the photons the plants need in precisely timed increments. These skyscraper farms spare countless acres for forests and parks. As for the chicken and beef, much of it comes from cellular meat facilities, which grow animal cells to make chicken breasts and rib eye steaks-no live animals needed, which means no confinement and slaughter. Once prohibitively expensive, cultivated meat scaled with the help of plentiful electricity. When your parents were young, nearly 25 percent of all global land was used to raise livestock for human consumption. That is unimaginable now. Much of that land has rewilded.

>Out the window and across the street, an autonomous drone is dropping off the latest shipment of star pills. Several years ago, daily medications that reduced overcating, cured addiction, and slowed cellular aging were considered miracle drugs for the rich, especially when we discovered that key molecules were best synthesized in the zero-gravity conditions of space. But these days, automated factories thrum in low orbit. Cheap rocketry conveys the medicine down to earth, where it's saved millions of lives and billions of healthy years.

>Outside, the air is clean and humming with the purr of electric machines all around you. Electric cars and trucks glide down the road, quiet as a light breeze and mostly self-driving. Children and adult commuters follow on electric bikes and scooters, some personally owned and some belonging to subscription networks run by the city. Another last-mile delivery drone descends from canopy level, pauses over a neighbor's yard like a hummingbird, and drops off a package. These e-bots now deliver a sizable chunk of online orders, reducing the drudgery of much human delivery work.

>Your micro-carpiece pings: a voice text from a friend and his family, on their way to the airport for another weekend vacation. Across the economy, the combination of artificial intelligence, labor rights, and economic reforms have reduced poverty and shortened the workweek. Thanks to higher productivity from Al, most people can complete what used to be a full week of work in a few days, which has expanded the number of holidays, long weekends, and vacations. Less work has not meant less pay. Al is built on the collective knowledge of humanity, and so its profits are shared. Your friends are flying from New York to London. The trip will take them just over two hours. Modern jetliners now routinely reach Mach 2—twice the speed of sound-using a mix of traditional and green synthetic fuels that release far less carbon into the air.

>The world has changed. Not just the virtual world, that dance of pixels on our screens. The physical world, too: its houses, its energy, its infrastructure, its medicines, its hard tech. How different this era is from the opening decades of the twenty-first century, which unspooled a string of braided crises. A housing crisis. A financial crisis. A pandemic. A climate crisis. Political crises. For years, we accepted homelessness and poverty and untreated disease and declining life expectancy. For years, we knew what we needed to build to alleviate the scarcities so many faced and create the opportunities so many wanted, and we simply didn't build it. For years, we failed to invent and implement technology that would make the world deaner, healthier, and richer. For years, we constrained our ability to solve the most important problems. Why?

Is this picture realistic? Is this the future you want? Can the abundance agenda really take us here?",3,1752168723.0,AskALiberal,30,0.8,False

May I ask what the cheapest coffee shop is in Canary Wharf or near it?

I found this article that gives lots of options: [https://secretldn.com/cheapest-coffee-near-tube/](https://secretldn.com/cheapest-coffee-near-tube/)  
The one nearest to me in Bank is called The Coffee House, however, I can't find it on google, potentially because of the name lol.  
From zooming into the tube image, I think Dock Coffee is my best bet, 3.20 for a medium latte (if the menu hasn't changed).

  
Any better options would be most appreciated. 

Kindest regards,

Yogi

I went on a date with a nice girl from work. I originally said coffee date but when I met up with her I changed it to Chinese food and she said sure but she wasn’t particularly hungry cause she ate before the date.

We got to the Chinese restaurant and she ordered some chicken with rice and said she could prob eat. 

As the food is served she goes “so what did you do this weekend?” And I told her but as I’m talking I notice she’s looking at me but not eating. She takes one bite as I pause, then focuses back to me. I’m like “do you not like it?” She says she does but wants to listen to what I’m saying and that was all. So after 5 minutes she’s only had like 3 bites. She pauses eating to talk. 

I told her again like obviously you don’t like it. She goes “I DO like it. I just am talking and eating at the same time that’s all. There’s no rush is there?” I go “no but like it’s obvious you don’t like it” she goes “I do like it” then she asks about my job and how I got into it. 

I answer her question and again she’s eating slow. I go “I can tell you don’t like it just stop eating” she goes “….fine you know what?? Ya don’t like it. Happy??” Then I paid for it without her asking and she went “why don’t we just leave” and she took it home to go. 

She texted me later explaining she was trying to just not rush and have a nice conversation and showed me her empty Tupperware that she did in fact eat it. 

The next week we went for all you can eat sushi. We ordered food, she ate it, but she only ate 12 pieces. Originally we were supposed to get coffee again, but I changed it to sushi. She did eat significantly more than before obviously but she still only had 12 maki rolls. She asked me “next time, can we maybe establish for sure what we’re doing BEFORE we go? I like that you’re down to play it by ear but if you say coffee and you change it to lunch…well I already ate.” 

I told her if she eats too slow in the future and stuff this would be a problem because I want to enjoy food with a girlfriend. She said she understands that, but maybe plan an actual lunch date instead. 

Did I mess up??

1lwiqbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1lwiqbf/decoding_the_enigma_of_the_rotating_bar_code/,Decoding the Enigma of the Rotating Bar Code,"Has anyone successfully ""decoded"" the rotational barcode system used by Nespresso Vertuoline pods/capsule?

I've not done any deep-dive research -- this was just morning musings -- but the thought occurred that each product barcode tells the machine not just size, but others parameters, which have been ""hinted"" at including temperature, length of bloom time, total time of the pour (speed of pour), and some other speculated possibilities.

I'm curious in that if each product capsule contains this information for that particular product's ""BEST BREW"", it would interesting to see if darker roasts have different parameters than medium or light roast -- or if it's all just pure speculation, and it only passes size information and possibly water temperature.

I don't know if the topic of ""refilling"" is verboten here, but it does seem that a lot of folks do it for a variety of reasons - not simply to save on the costly pleasure, but to allow for a bit more variety outside of those specifically licensed product producers.

Whatever the case, I've wondered if anyone has taken different capsules of the same size (perhaps the 7.7 oz coffee pods) from different products and refilled them all with the same bean, grind, and amount, to discover if different product pods of the same size yield different results from identical refills.

Granted, I get it, that the Nespresso pre-filled pods are optimized for their contents, but I'd really like to know just how far down the Rabbit Hole that goes -- Mythbuster style.

Anyway, that's what I get for musing over a Nespresso Coffee from the variety pack that came with my unit.  Would have preferred more coffee than single and double shots, but either way, I need to pick my next sleeve of coffee pods, so I'd like some ""coffee size"" (7.7 oz) pod recommendations, as well as any potential tips for the possibility of refilling, until Nespresso opens it's gates to a larger variety.

My wife and I stayed at an Airbnb in London recently. The house itself was fine but we had many issues during check in with their remote keypad. We didn’t let it bother us too much. 

On the last day, my wife accidentally spilled coffee on the bedroom rug. We soaked it up using towels and let the host know immediately. We even sent them photos apologizing for the mishap and offering to pay for professional cleaning. 

We haven’t heard back from them in almost 12 days but now, they have reached out asking for $3,000 in compensation. That amount is ridiculous and there is no way we can pay it. 

They say they spent $500 on professional cleaning already, which in itself, seems unbelievable. But, they are not happy and want to replace the rug in the entire bedroom and it’ll cost another $2,500. 

Doesn’t Airbnb have something called Aircover? Shouldn’t it cover this sort of claim? Any help or advice is appreciated because I feel like I am being taken advantage of. TIA",10,1752168543.0,airbnb_hosts,43,0.86,False

Hello!

We released Travel + 1 and a bunch more this week in our update, and also released a hotfix fixing some issues people found from the new update. We've also cooked up one more update coming with a few pieces of new content, and a bunch of bugs that the community found fixed. And it adds the isometric maps Maxchill has been working on to the game!

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Our customer support email has changed to support@walkscape.app. We've developed admin tools so that Weasel and maxchill can solve some customer support cases even during the vacation, and they'll be reading the new support email inbox!**

# Summer vacation

As stated in the previous development blog, we'll be on annual summer vacation this year. **The vacation starts on 12th of July and ends on 3rd of August!** During this time, we'll not be releasing development blogs as usual (or if there's going to be one, it'll be a light hearted one about what we've been doing on the vacation). Also, customer support will be very limited, but we've added new admin tools for Weasel and maxchill so they can help with most common support cases. Our support related email address has changed to **support@walkscape.app**.

# Gear tool created by community member fala

# New intern at Not a Cult!

We also have a Summer intern working at Not a Cult for couple of months, Arth!



Hi, my name is Arthur, I don't have a strong internet presence but I usually go by nickname Arth (very creative, I know). I am currently an intern and will be working with Not a Cult for the next two months. I’m studying for a bachelor's degree in video game design and graphics, in this course I learn about nearly everything related to the video game industry - marketing, programing and design, the last thing is what I am interested the most, specifically, drawing. I’m an artist, and in my free time, I usually create classical art, meaning I draw on paper with pencil. However, recently I’ve been working to expand my skills, and I’ve started exploring digital art.

I owe my internship at this company to maxchill, the artist at Not a Cult, who recommended me for this position after finding my “resume” on one of the forums. We’re both from Latvia, and he shared with me his passion for helping others gain experience in the industry - especially considering that there are limited opportunities for aspiring artists here. I’m grateful to maxchill and everyone at Not a Cult for giving me this opportunity.

As I mentioned, I likely won’t be here for long, since I'm just an intern for a set period of time. However, during my stay, I’ll work hard to gain as much knowledge and as many skills as possible and hopefully by the end of my internship, some of my work will make it into the game. I’m looking forward to spending time with this friendly team and receiving feedback from the community on my future work.

Not like, everything is fully bleached every day rigid, but I keep things wiped, swept, and tidied. I vacuum almost every day, dust weekly, bed changed twice weekly, bathroom/kitchen wiped down nightly. I think it's fairly normal and sanitary, and no one's ever been like ""you have a serious problem"" or whatever. 

I am VERY lucky that I am married to a like-minded lady (we're both ladies, which sort of matters here, maybe). Overall, we run a pretty tight ship and keep messes and dirt to a minimum. The issue has been the past year: Wife's brother is going through a divorce and he and the ex are ""nesting"" which means they share the family home every other week. On his off-weeks, he stays here at our house, so 1/2 the time, we have a roommate. This is indefinite with no end in sight.

Additionally, my wife's mom was placed in a nursing home around the same time the divorce stuff started. The place is a hellhole, but everyone works and no one has room or 24/7 supervision capabilities (especially us, seeing as her brother is a third person in our tiny house every other week). So, we end up having her over a lot. A LOT, a lot: like 2-3 days a week, for 5-10 hours at a time. It's too much for me but my wife wants to do this for her mom so I am trying to be supportive and not add more stress to her plate.

The combination of these things means that on most days now, everywhere I go, there is someone else's mess. Brother is a very good guy but just not as clean as I'd hoped he would be, especially considering he's living in the house, free of charge, of a very openly clean person. He cooks with lots of garlic and doesn't use the fans to mitigate the smell. The finished basement, where he stays, has developed a permanent dirty-hair smell (IYKYK) and he doesn't clean up before he leaves each week. It's not filthy--it's just not wiped, swept, and tidied. His stuff seeps into every area of the basement and we can no longer use it as our second living space, which we were kind of counting on as we did buy a very small home. My wife is good about cleaning up but I have to ask her to do it (I'm sorry, I draw the line at someone else's poo-streaked toilet) and it's starting to be a friction point because she doesn't think it's that bad, which makes me feel slightly insane because we are both looking at the same visibly dirty half-bathroom when I point it out. I want them to install a shower in the basement but they have not made any headway in doing that.  
  
The Mom-mess is more temporary since she doesn't live here, but when she's here, it's widespread. She takes over the kitchen, living room, and full bathroom with her stuff the moment she's here and it's out and around until the moment she finally goes. No one seems to care that there are shoes in the middle of the floor or two kinds of sugar spilled all over the coffee counter. I KNOW I have to let this part go, at least....

But how?? Are there any clean freaks stuck with dirtier folks around for the foreseeable future? Do I just have to smoke more weed and suck it up? HELP ME.",5,1752168320.0,CleaningTips,10,1.0,False

Well, in the fall of 2023, I decided to make a concentrated effort to try and find the cause of this depression. I stopped drinking, cut down screen time, gave up coffee, exercised more, and did everything I could to ""fix"" it, but nothing worked. Eventually, a memory popped into my head, and I remembered secretly dressing up in my mom's clothes as a kid. I can't remember why I started, but it would be the first thing I would do whenever I was home alone for a couple of years. This was in the late 90s & I had no frame of reference to understand why I was doing this, but all I knew was that it felt good. Eventually, I started getting worried about getting caught, and this fear led me to stop. 

I had this sudden realization that I had been playing a character of a man for the past 30 years. It was a character that wasn't my true self, and I was so asleep at the wheel that I hadn't been aware of what I was doing. It was an ""Aha!"" moment, and I thought that this was the cause of the depression that I had missed. I dove into this subreddit, read the Gender Dysphoria Bible, and talked to all my LGBTQ friends to get some more perspective. It seemed this was my path, and after 5 months of research, I decided to pull the trigger and start HRT. It was such an exciting time as I was starting to fully explore who I truly was and wear clothes that made me feel whole. This feminine side that was so repressed was starting to come out more, and I was giddy at the thought of where I would end up.

It was in March of this year, or around the 10-month mark of HRT, that I felt like I hit a wall. My true identity was fully out, but it wasn't what I expected. I liked wearing women's clothes, as they fit better, but I started ""dialing"" it back and presenting more gender neutral as this felt more like myself. With this, being referred to with she/her pronouns started to not feel right as well. I also started being more appreciative of the masculine traits that I still possessed, but this started giving me worry that they would be fading away as time went on. No longer did I look in the mirror with excitement about what estrogen would bring, only worry about what it would take away. 

So for the past four months, I have been coming to the realization that HRT is not for me. It allowed me to fully explore and find who I was, but the end result of HRT does not fit who that is.

Writing this out is definitely more for me to organize my thoughts, but thank you for reading. I am so grateful for this forum and all that I have learned from it. You all are amazing <3

1lwib2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lwib2z/should_you_buy_the_hamilton_beach_46299_coffee/,Should You Buy the Hamilton Beach 46299 Coffee Maker Review for Your Kitchen?,"The Hamilton Beach 46299 programmable coffee maker has been living on my kitchen counter for a few months now, and it's become my go-to coffee companion. It promises convenience with its programmable settings and customizable brew strength, and as someone who relies on their daily caffeine fix, I was more than excited to put it to the test. From those pre-dawn work mornings to those lazy Sunday afternoons, this machine has seen it all.

**DESIGN AND AESTHETICS**

The sleek black-and-stainless-steel finish pairs seamlessly with my other kitchen appliances, adding a touch of modernity to the counter. At just over 12 inches in height, it doesn’t hog too much space, making it a good fit for compact setups. The layout of buttons and the digital display are intuitive; even my parents figured out how to program it without resorting to a manual—which says a lot!

**BREW OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE**

This coffee maker shines in the versatility department. The Select-a-Brew feature, which lets you choose between regular and bold brews, is such a win for households with differing coffee strength preferences. I usually go for bold, while my partner prefers a lighter flavor, and switching between the two is as simple as pressing a button. An option to brew just 1-4 cups is also available, making it handy when only I need a quick solo cuppa.

**Check [Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)**

**CONVENIENCE AT ITS BEST**

The programmable timer is pure gold. I’ve set it up in the evenings more times than I can count so that the smell of fresh coffee greets me as I stumble into the kitchen at 6 a.m. The auto-pause and serve function practically spoiled me—I can grab a cup while it’s still brewing without spilling everywhere, which feels magical during hectic mornings.

**POSITIVES**

- Programmable settings make mornings smoother by having coffee ready on schedule.  
- Brew strength options (regular, bold, or 1-4 cups) cater to variable caffeine needs.  
- The auto-pause feature lets you sneak a cup mid-brew without a mess.  
- Borosilicate glass carafe and brew basket are dishwasher safe, easing cleanup.  

**BUILD QUALITY AND DURABILITY**

The machine feels sturdy despite its lightweight design, and the borosilicate glass carafe has held up well, even after a couple of dishwasher runs. I haven’t noticed any inconsistencies in brewing temperature, which is excellent for maintaining the taste of the coffee.

**LIMITATIONS**

- The paper filter system can feel wasteful and may deter those who prefer reusable options.  
- There’s no option to shut off the beep when the brewing process finishes, which can be disruptive first thing in the morning.  
- While the warming plate works well, it only stays on for up to two hours, which means reheating becomes a necessity if you prefer sipping your coffee slowly.  

**CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE**

Keeping the machine clean hasn’t been a chore. The removable lift-and-clean brew basket and carafe go straight into the dishwasher, and the warming plate is non-stick, making it easy to wipe down. Cord storage hidden discreetly at the back prevents countertop clutter—a small but cool touch.

**PRODUCT ALTERNATIVES**

Compared to other coffee makers like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or the Keurig K-Elite, the Hamilton Beach model stands its ground well. The Cuisinart offers a more robust stainless steel design and reusable filters, but it comes at a higher price point and takes up more counter space. With single-serve as the focus, the Keurig lacks the programmable feature or capacity for larger volumes of coffee that the Hamilton Beach delivers. For families or coffee enthusiasts who like traditional drip coffee without breaking the bank, the 46299 strikes a great balance between features and affordability.

**TRUE VALUE**

Given its features—like programmable brewing, customizable brew strength, and auto-pause functionality—this machine delivers solid value. It isn’t the most high-end coffee maker on the market, but for its price range, it’s hard to beat. Plus, the easy maintenance ensures it suits busy lifestyles or those who, like me, just don’t want to spend time scrubbing coffee stains.

1lwia7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ex30/comments/1lwia7u/6_weeks_later_ex_porsche_owner/,6 Weeks Later - Ex Porsche Owner,"UK based owner, bored sat on a train yesterday so started a brain dump of my thoughts on the EX30…apologies long post. 

I’ve been driving the EX30 for about 6 weeks now, and I’ve racked up around 1600 miles! I’m usually in the car solo, commuting a 30-mile round trip 2-3 days a week to the office, plus a 250-mile trip to another office every couple of weeks. I wanted to share my thoughts on the car, the dealership/ownership experience, and the whole switch from ICE to BEV. I’m not new to Volvo (we had a XC90 when the kids were little and thought it was the best family car ever), but I jumped into the EX30 from a 2-year-old Porsche Macan. 

I’d been thinking about getting an electric Porsche since the Taycan came out, but the dealers were super pushy (basically, there’s a waiting list, so you either want one or not?), and the depreciation was insane because they were flooding the market with business users who then put them back into dealers at the end of their PCP/lease. Those same dealers are still asking top dollar for them and offering crazy finance rates, which started to bug me. I took the electric Macan for a test drive, but to get the same specs as the car I had on the drive was over £80k—a price I just couldn’t justify.

The Macan was getting close to 3 years old (October), and I was starting to think about the costs of keeping it around (service, warranty extensions, etc.). Keeping a car past 3 years always feels like throwing money away. One Sunday morning, I was stuck in traffic because of a local half-marathon, and I noticed that every 25-plate car was a BEV. Three friends had recently gone electric, and I was starting to think the tipping point was near where the dealer incentives would disappear as manufacturers started to hit their targets. I just happened to be driving past the new Volvo dealership, and the EX30 had previously caught my eye on the road, so I decided to pull in… 

The sales experience was pretty good! OK It wasn’t quite the same as Porsche, but it was super relaxed. They were happy to just hand me the keys to a car for a few hours and told me to come back before they closed. Car impressed on the test drive, although I was expecting it to be more the size of the XC40 but the deal was really something else.  A £1500 deposit contribution, 3yrs free servicing, a free Ohme wall charger, and 0% finance! It definitely made me think, so I went home and started crunching the numbers. I fed some parameters into chatGPT (see attached), and the answer was absolutely mind-blowing. The money I would be putting into the Macan to keep it another year would simply be dead money. The savings from the EX30 would give me the chance to try electric without the eye-watering depreciation of a Taycan/Macan.

Of course, I went with the Ultra Twin Performance. I was able to pick any colour/interior combo and because all were in the Volvo compound could be delivered within a week or so. I had already settled on Vapour Grey/Mist, was left alone to complete the order and finance application online in the dealership, and on completion was informed the car would be ready to collect just over a week later.

Collection was a mixed bag and probably highlighted the mismatch between sales and new technology… basically, despite pretending to be tech-savvy, the sales exec messed up the set up of internet in the car and my profile. It was the end of the day, so no one was around, and the advice was, “…go home it takes time to connect, give it 30 mins, and it will all be working!”… Of course, that wasn’t the case… more on that below…My biggest gripe was the lack of attention to detail, the main annoyance being neither the front or rear plates were put on straight, which once I’d spotted back home drove me crazy until I refitted them properly…I’m pretty sure that would have been a written warning at Porsche LOL. 

So the setup issue! I was really expecting to drive back to the dealer (luckily just a couple of miles away) to get a technician to take a look. Honestly, I was a bit worried since I’ve had Vodafone issues in cars before. The next morning, I was sipping a coffee and stumbled upon the help section in the EX30 app. I messaged Volvo, and I was so pleasantly surprised to find someone who knew what they were doing on the other end! Basically, in just 5 minutes, they did a full OTA reset, told me to leave the car for an hour.I headed back to the car an hour later, and everything was working perfectly…Was really impressed that was all it took to fix the issue and that’s been the only issue I’ve had. Fingers crossed it stays that way!

So, my thoughts on the EX30 in no particular order…

The good…

Design - I really like the design, in fact seeing one on the road is what grabbed my attention. Everyone who’s commented has said how great the car looks, and I have to agree! I’d actually say it’s more Polestar than Volvo. And the number of people who have said it looks ‘futuristic’ was a surprise.

Build Quality - I was coming into the purchase with Volvo in mind as a premium, albeit mainstream manufacturer. But after hanging out in forums and FB groups I started to worry maybe the EX30 was a more budget-friendly option. Maybe I’ve lowered my expectations, but the build quality has been amazing. Actually, there have been fewer squeaks and rattles than any recent car I’ve owned. 

Performance - Even without the All Wheel Performance mode on, it’s insane!

Mist - Instead of the Nordic ‘pleather’ that the dealer had in every car on the lot, I went with what I call ‘full Ikea’ and picked the wool Mist interior. TBH, I was aiming for a complete contrast to the dark interior of every car I can remember. Initially, I was trying to justify the choice, thinking people would think I was being cheap, but no need! Everyone has been so complimentary over Mist. TBH if there had been a similar light coloured leather option I’d have probably picked it but im pretty happy with the Mist trim. 

Materials - It’s a bit unfair to directly compare cabin materials between a Porsche & the EX30, but I think Volvo has really nailed the sustainability angle, which helps to hide (or maybe even excuse) the obvious differences.

Pilot Assist - Once I got used to it, this feature has been absolutely flawless. I’d even say that, along with the car’s overall vibe, it’s actually mellowed me as a driver and more than happy for the car to do its thing for me. 

Vapour Grey - I absolutely love the colour! I paid £1600 for a similar colour on the Macan, and I was always disappointed it wasn’t just plain grey rather a chalky, grey, or beige shade depending on how bright the day was. Vapour Grey is the colour I’ve always wanted!

Charging - The only time I’ve used a fast charger, the car had already charged 40-80% before I’d grabbed my coffee from the Starbucks next door! I used a granny charger at home waiting for the Ohme install and wasn’t really any issue. Once the complimentary Ohme install was done, Intelligent Octopus Go really seems to be a total game-changer.

Screen Only - Not a problem for me at all… the stuff I use the most is easily accessible through shortcuts. The one thing I always spot in reviews is changing the mirrors, but how often do people change mirror positions I haven’t changed them since I set up the car at the dealer!

Mirrors - Speaking of mirrors, I absolutely love the design of the frameless mirrors.

Digital key-  I know this one is a mixed bag for some, but generally, for me, it’s been brilliant. I hate carrying things in my pockets. My phone/watch has replaced my wallet but even though I’ve had keyless entry/start on cars for years ive still had to carry a key. Using the phone/watch seems like the future…it’s a bit weird sometimes walking into the kitchen and seeing the car unlock/lock out of the window, but it’s worked pretty much faultlessly with the odd exception where I’ve had to pull on the door handle a couple of times… maybe I should try to correlate that to whether or not the car has been locking/unlocking as I go through the house? I believe the UWB is clever enough to know if you’re approaching the car, etc. so maybe I’m confusing the car as I approach it and unlocks in the house then locks again before I leave? 

EX30 App - Okay, another area that seem to divide the community…but it pretty much does what I want and has the features I need. I’d describe the design as ‘Scandinavian,’ like the car, super clean and fuss-free, so I’m not sure what’s missing, it does more than the Porsche app that i never looked at after a few days. I do seem to get logged out every couple of weeks but it connects to my car without fail when I log back in. The biggest letdown is the dead link to the online manual. Also, it’s a bit strange that to get the widget/watch app, you need to link the Volvo Cars app, and that’s not obvious at first glance!

Pano Roof - I absolutely love how light and spacious it makes the interior! Had this on the last car and whilst I miss the chance to open for a bit of air I also know that pano roofs are a source of real pain with blocked rain channels etc so maybe the simpler implementation here is actually the better option? 

Negatives…

Penny pinching - I’ve noticed some signs of building to a budget. I know car prices have gone up a lot in the last 4-5 years, and I know the range starts at around in the mid £30k range, but mine is still a £45k car from a ‘premium’ manufacturer. Its all screwed together well but missing things like door scuff plates given that a set cost me less than a tenner from AliExpress, and IMHO, really lifts the impression of quality when you open the door… why aren’t they fitted from the factory? 

Wipers - Why does it default to wiping the screen as soon as you open the door? I usually avoid using wipers, so having them smear the screen for the slightest moisture on the sensor is a real pain!

Lemon! - Why the lemon-coloured accents in the centre console? Just give me boring old black or grey!

Durability - Although I’ve been impressed with most materials, some interior plastics seem to be easily scratched, annoyingly these are in high-contact areas (the inner sills and areas around the seatbelt buckle).

Seats - I know they aren’t supposed to be super sporty seats, but a little more bolstering and thigh length would be great… actually, in the twin performance, why not something a little more overtly sporty?

Public Charging - Not had a problem with locations or reliability, my issue is the cost…it’s crazy expensive…dont mind paying 60-70p for the fast chargers when im on the road, but the number of 7kw chargers charging similar price for slow charging is a joke! 

Meh… 

HUD/secondary Display - The main display is fine for me, got used to it after a few days  but I’m curious why an extra one above the steering wheel isnt even an option. Whilst It’s not really a deal-breaker, but it would have addressed most of the negativity in the vast majority of reviews and in the grand scheme of things would cost pennies. That said I don’t remember any big fuss when the Toyota Yaris or the BMW Mini had a central instrument binnacle ages ago think that motoring journalists are just cutting and pasting each other for copy at times! 

Range - I was sold a car with a 280-mile range. The official stats are 279.6 miles combined, 366.6 miles city (I’ll have what they were smoking that day please), and I’m getting a predicted maximum of about 220 miles in the summer with a full charge. Bearing in mind I dont charge above 90% and dont drop below 20% thats only 70% so realistically it’s 160 miles. I’m not sure if I should call trading standards LOL!

Rear Space - It’s usually just me most journey, maybe the odd journey with a passenger, and I don’t really use the back seat, but I’d love another inch or two in the back. It feels like the car’s packaging is a bit tight for its size.

Steering - It feels a bit too light, even when I’m in the firmest setting. It feels like I could drive it with one finger!

One Pedal Driving: Since it’s my first electric car, it’s hard to compare, but I find the OPD underwhelming. I’m not sure if I should trust it to stop me or not! Fingers crossed the next update will fix this.

Wheel Design: I’m not a huge fan of the wheel designs, the new 20-inch design for MY26 looks much nicer!

Driver Safety features - like everyone else I turn off the driver attention and speed limit warnings as soon as I get in the car…I know why are they are there but Volvo please add an option to turn off all driver alerts from the steering wheel. TBH The user defined options for the steering wheel aren’t really much use!

Google - not sure if its still booting after the car has started sometimes takes what sometimes Google seems to take what seems like an age before I can issue voice commands to the assistant…noticeable when setting off an want to add a sat nav destination. 

Overall, its not perfect but I’m pretty positive about the EX30 and give it a solid 8/10*",11,1752167555.0,ex30,5,1.0,False

Ever had that nagging voice in your head? The one that whispers 'you're not good enough,' or 'that's a terrible idea,' just when you're trying to focus or make a big decision? Yeah, we've all been there. That, my friend, is your inner critic, and it can be a real roadblock to mental clarity and peak performance. It's like having a constant, low-level static buzz in your brain.

But here's the thing: you don't have to live with it. Just like we biohack our bodies for better energy or physical strength, we can absolutely biohack our minds to quiet that critical voice and unlock a level of mental clarity you might not have thought possible. It's about understanding how your brain works and giving it the right tools and environment to thrive. Let's dive in.

## Understanding Your Inner Critic - And Why It's There

First, let's get one thing straight: your inner critic isn't inherently evil. Often, it's a distorted protection mechanism. It tries to keep you safe from perceived failure or judgment. The problem is, it often overshoots, creating self-doubt and anxiety that hold you back more than they help.

For a biohacker, this isn't just a philosophical problem - it's a performance bottleneck. When your mind is cluttered with self-criticism, it's harder to:
* **Focus** on tasks.
* **Innovate** and think creatively.
* **Make clear decisions** without second-guessing.
* **Manage stress** effectively.

So, how do we turn down the volume on this internal chatter? It's about a multi-faceted approach that leverages both ancient wisdom and modern science.

## Practical Biohacks for a Quieter Mind

This isn't about magical pills or quick fixes. It's about consistent, intentional practices that reshape your mental landscape.

### 1. Embrace Mindful Awareness - Your Brain's Reset Button

This is probably the most powerful tool in your arsenal. Mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind - it's about observing your thoughts without judgment. Think of your thoughts as clouds passing in the sky. You see them, you acknowledge them, but you don't grab onto them and ride them into a storm.

* **Daily Meditation**: Start with 5-10 minutes a day. Use a guided app or just sit in silence, focusing on your breath. When the inner critic pops up (and it will!), simply notice it, and gently bring your focus back to your breath. I've found that even short bursts can make a huge difference in how I react to self-doubt throughout the day.
* **Mindful Moments**: Throughout your day, take short breaks to just *be*. Notice the taste of your coffee, the feeling of your feet on the floor, the sounds around you. This pulls you out of your head and into the present.

### 2. Nourish Your Brain - Food as Fuel for Clarity

Your brain is a hungry organ, and what you feed it directly impacts your mental state. A poorly nourished brain is more susceptible to anxiety and negative thought patterns.

* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Think fatty fish like salmon, or flaxseeds. These are crucial for brain cell structure and function.
* **Magnesium**: Often called nature's relaxant, magnesium helps regulate neurotransmitters and can reduce stress. Dark leafy greens, nuts, and seeds are great sources.
* **Limit Processed Foods and Sugar**: These can lead to blood sugar spikes and crashes, triggering mood swings and brain fog. Your brain thrives on stable energy. I've noticed a massive drop in my mental clarity and an increase in self-doubt when I let my diet slip.

### 3. Prioritize Sleep - The Ultimate Brain Cleaner

Sleep is non-negotiable for mental health and clarity. During deep sleep, your brain literally clears out metabolic waste products that accumulate during the day. Think of it as a nightly detox for your mind.

* **Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends. This regulates your circadian rhythm.
* **Create a ""Wind-Down"" Routine**: An hour before bed, dim the lights, put away screens, maybe read a book or take a warm bath. This signals to your brain that it's time to relax.
* **Optimize Your Sleep Environment**: Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.

### 4. Move Your Body - Shake Off the Mental Rust

Physical activity isn't just for your muscles; it's a powerful biohack for your brain. Exercise releases endorphins, reduces stress hormones, and can even promote the growth of new brain cells.

* **Regular Exercise**: Find something you enjoy - walking, running, dancing, weightlifting. Aim for at least 30 minutes most days.
* **Break Up Sedentary Time**: Even short walks throughout the day can help clear your head and boost your mood. When I feel stuck on a problem or hear that inner critic pipe up, a quick walk around the block often provides the perspective I need.

### 5. Cultivate Gratitude and Positive Self-Talk

This is a direct counter-punch to the inner critic. If you're constantly hearing negative messages, you need to actively replace them with positive ones.

* **Gratitude Journaling**: Every day, write down 3-5 things you're grateful for. This trains your brain to look for the positive.
* **Affirmations**: Create short, positive statements about yourself and repeat them daily. It might feel silly at first, but consistency builds new neural pathways. Instead of ""I'm not good enough,"" try ""I am capable and I am learning.""

### 6. Digital Detox - Reclaim Your Mental Space

We're constantly bombarded with information, notifications, and comparisons online. This external noise can amplify your internal critic.

* **Schedule Screen-Free Time**: Designate periods each day or week where you put away your phone and computer.
* **Limit Social Media**: Be mindful of how it makes you feel. If it's fueling comparison or self-doubt, consider unfollowing accounts or taking a break. It's amazing how much clearer your head feels when you're not constantly scrolling.

## Your Journey to Mental Clarity

Quieting your inner critic isn't about making it disappear entirely - that's probably not realistic. It's about reducing its power, understanding its whispers, and choosing not to let it control your thoughts or actions. By consistently applying these biohacks, you're not just managing a symptom; you're fundamentally rewiring your brain for more clarity, resilience, and inner peace.

Start small. Pick one or two of these practices and commit to them for a week. Notice the subtle shifts. Over time, you'll find that your inner critic becomes less of a shouting match and more of a distant echo, allowing your true, clear voice to shine through.

I only have one basic card right now that gives 1% on everything, which feels like a waste now.

I’m an IC working for AWS Canada. Not going into team or segment details for obvious reasons, but here’s my honest take after a few years here: AWS has seriously gone downhill.

Leadership in Canada, especially at the senior levels, feels like it’s more about survival than vision. Everyone’s scrambling to stay relevant and hang onto their jobs. The broader direction of AWS is also questionable—beyond infrastructure (which AWS still leads due to its early start), doing anything else feels like pulling teeth. Innovation outside the core ecosystem is practically discouraged, and it’s rapidly making the rest of my skill set obsolete.

**On AI and GenAI:**  
AWS dropped the ball. It’s clear that Amazon was caught off guard by ChatGPT and Microsoft’s swift rollout of CoPilot. I’ve used CoPilot and Azure AI Studio—it’s seamless. Customers don’t care if Bedrock or Q has better models. They care about ease of use and cutting costs. And let’s be real: AWS’s AI messaging feels like a weak remix of “we led cloud, so we lead AI.” That doesn’t hold up anymore with better, cheaper alternatives hitting the market.

**On Canadian Leadership:**  
I don’t feel any of the Amazonian culture here—assuming it ever existed. It’s all parroting from the top, with very little authenticity. Leadership is painfully out of touch with economic realities. They want us to push sales tactics on customers who are just trying to keep their lights on. My contact is more worried about affording groceries than grabbing coffee to hear how amazing Amazon Q supposedly is.

**On “Social” Expectations:**  
I got written up for not attending enough social events. I’m in a back-end role—not sales or solutions architecture. But apparently not showing up for customer happy hours is now a performance issue. How does that affect my ability to write quality code?

**On Jassy’s Leadership:**  
Jassy doesn’t inspire confidence. He gives off strong ""corporate exec trying to look like a tech bro"" energy. It’s all buzzwords and bureaucracy. Every task has three leaders watching over it, but only one actually does anything. The rest just want to be seen. And threatening layoffs? That’s not how you build morale or innovation.

**On DEI:**  
If “two-faced” were a company, this would be it. The DEI messaging is pure PR—hollow and performative. They even buried the DEI page in the wiki around the same time Trump became president. Either stand behind your values or stop pretending.

**On RTO:**  
Return-to-office is a joke. We don’t even have an Amazon office in my city, so my badge gets deactivated. Yet we’re told to “badge in” or relocate—or leave. What exactly do they expect me to do in the office that I’m not already doing effectively from home? So do you want me to relocate 30 minutes away from an Amazon office so I can end up being 2 hours away from my customers?

**Final Thoughts:**  
Why should anyone at Amazon work themselves to the bone for Jassy or Bezos when they could make more launching a startup or consulting—without all the BS? I genuinely believe the future is moving toward lean, specialized consulting and away from bloated corps like this. But I digress. I'm just here for the rest of my RSUs.",10,1752166654.0,amazonemployees,9,0.92,False

I've found that when drafting treaties with the ai, there are goods that the AI will have  a positive bonus when Goods Transfer is added to a treaty. For example, in a recent game as Haiti, Britain had a +10 approval to the acceptance of the treaty if *they* transfered me 16% of their fabric output.

Where this got ridiculous is when I became a minor power and doing a trade with Venezuela, they had +27 approval for transferring 100% of their coffee to me, as well as some other goods and money, for nothing in return.

Now as far as I understand how goods transfers work, the nation sending the good buys that good from their own market with money out of their budget, and sends it to another nation for 0 cost to that nation.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, I don't get why the AI would be so ecstatic to send me their goods. Like in the Venezuela example, why would they be so excited to send me 100% of their coffee market at their own governments expense? ",1,1752166606.0,victoria3,4,1.0,False

Passports are not required for you and everyone knows who you are (imagine the tik tok where she’s undocumented in Mexico and the US deported her ass since she an undocumented alien)?

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1752166591.0,Poe_AI,0,1.0,False

Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1752166579.0,Poe_AI,0,1.0,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://dfd2fdwfn1rl6w7iyrwc7bfmfm.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

He has an exceptional way of showing me he’s thinking of me by doing these beautiful grand gestures. 

Some examples: 

Early in to dating I introduced him to a song I loved that fit our feelings of falling for someone perfectly. The next time I saw him, he brought me a framed personalized print of a record. The record design was made of the lyrics in a spiral pattern. The print had the song title, the Spotify QR code and the date we first laid in bed listening to it. 

On his drive out of town one weekend, he stopped on the mountain pass where he knew there was a DOT camera, held up a big sign, and then sent me the DOT link for that camera so I could see it. 

We have an inside joke about my enthusiastic love for Uncle Dans ranch dressing. He wrote to the company to ask if they had merch to buy as there wasn’t any on their site. The email told the story of how their product played a part in him falling in love with me. They loved the story and sent me a surprise gift box with shirts, stickers, bracelets, and years worth of product. 

He somehow hired a group of young men in rural India to record themselves holding up a photo collage of me (that he made) and saying a personal message before breaking in to sing and dance. I’m guessing this was a Cameo but he wouldn’t confirm. 

He also makes hand made cards, leaves me little notes, creates cute videos, and sends surprise coffee/snack deliveries. 
He is so creative, thoughtful and romantic! I do nice things for him in my own way but I  need some fresh ideas.

Our team is suggesting Zyprexa first. They’ve had good success with it and rare incidence of side effects. They believe it would not only help his appetite/weight gain, but also significantly reduce his anxiety and rigid thinking.

I am also a nurse, so my inclination is to place a peg tube (I know he won’t tolerate an NGT). The food is the ‘medicine’ he needs and there are no unwanted medication side effects. However, I don’t want to expose my child to an unnecessary medical procedure and it ultimately doesn’t help fix the root cause of ARFID.

I live between München and Starnberg and I’d love to meet someone nearby who’s also looking for something real. Life feels more meaningful when you can share it with someone special, and that’s what I’m hoping to find. :)

I’m 187 cm tall with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a solid build with a little softness in the middle. I’m also on the hairier side. Just being upfront about it.

I enjoy the simple things. Quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime, manga, and board games, so you could say I’m a bit nerdy. :)

I don’t smoke or drink, and I’m not very religious, but I believe in kindness and keeping an open mind. What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I tend to feel that spark more with women who are slim, fit, or have an average build. Just sharing openly what I’m usually drawn to.

One thing that’s important for me to say early on is that I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know it’s a big thing to mention, but it feels right to be honest about what matters.

1lwhlle,https://i.redd.it/upwytoszs2cf1.jpeg,Justice Achieved: Confidential Truck Accident Settlement – DRS Law,"**Nashville Truck Accident Lawyers Secure Justice for Family After Fatal 18-Wheeler Crash**

[DRS Law](https://www.drslawfirm.com/) is proud to announce a successful confidential settlement in a recent wrongful death case involving a catastrophic trucking accident on Interstate 24 in Coffee County, Tennessee. While the names of the parties and the amount of the settlement remain confidential, this result underscores DRS Law’s experience and commitment to obtaining justice for victims of commercial vehicle and 18-wheeler accidents.

**Case Overview: Fatal Trucking Collision on Interstate 24**

Our client tragically lost a loved one when a commercial tractor-trailer, operated by a professional driver for a national trucking company, rear-ended a passenger vehicle late at night. The impact resulted in a devastating fire, causing fatal injuries to the occupants of the passenger vehicle. DNA testing was required to identify the remains, highlighting the severity of the crash and the profound loss suffered by the victim’s family

**Proving Negligence and Holding Trucking Companies Accountable**

DRS Law’s investigation revealed multiple violations of trucking safety standards, including:

* Failure to keep a proper lookout
* Failure to maintain control of the 18-wheeler
* Driving at an excessive and unsafe speed
* Failure to take evasive action to avoid the crash

Our legal team demonstrated that the truck driver’s negligence, as well as the trucking company’s inadequate hiring, training, and supervision practices, directly contributed to this tragic accident. We challenged unfounded defenses and relied on leading forensic and toxicology experts to establish the facts and refute unsupported claims regarding impairment.

**Why Truck Accident Cases Demand Specialized Experience**

Trucking accidents are not like ordinary car crashes. The companies that own and operate commercial vehicles are held to higher standards due to the potential for catastrophic injuries and loss of life.

In Tennessee and across the country, most truck accident settlements fall within the **low six figures to over $1 million** for cases involving significant injuries or fatalities

**How do I prove negligence in a truck accident case?**

Proving negligence in a truck accident requires demonstrating four key legal elements while gathering critical evidence to hold all responsible parties accountable.

We only went on one date. Coffee. Nothing special. He seemed nice enough, a little intense, but I brushed it off. I didn’t feel a strong connection, so I politely declined a second date.

That’s when things got weird.

Two days later, he showed up at my job. I never told him where I worked. He said he was “in the area” and wanted to surprise me. I laughed it off awkwardly, but my stomach dropped.

Then came the flowers. Daily. Notes like, “You’re the one.”
Then the texts. Dozens, even though I stopped responding.
Then the night I saw him sitting in his car… outside my apartment.

I blocked him on everything. Reported it. Even switched gyms and routes home. But I still feel watched. Every time I unlock my door, I wonder if he’s nearby.

And the worst part? Because he never technically did anything illegal, no one takes it seriously.

Has anyone else dealt with this? The “nice guy” stalker?

I was expecting a fun-filled two years with lots of development opportunities, and while I have enjoyed the academic elements of the program, the social scene has been terrible for me.  
  
I came into the program from a MF PE firm and was planning on returning to the buy-side post-graduation. However, I have faced constant derision from my classmates over my career choice. I frequently hear how ""private equity is killing American industry"" and that ""PE investors are vultures who destroy companies through financial engineering"". On the other hand, my friends in B4 Audit and Tech are praised for ""actually making a difference"". Faced with a crisis of conscience, I tried to get a referral from a PMM but he rejected me as we apparently weren't close enough.   
  
On that point, I have not been able to connect with my classmates whatsoever. My peers are all obsessed with k-pop and anime whereas I have mainly engaged with Western media. I tried to connect with their interests by listening to BLACKPINK and watching Death Note, but have been written off as 'basic'. I think what hurt most was when I had invited a group of acquaintances to the opening game of our local MLB team with the hopes that our friendship would grow. As I was lining up at the gate asking where people were, I received a text from them telling me that they had changed plans last minute in order to attend the Magic the Gathering: Tarkir Dragonstorm pre-release and that they were ""sure I could find other people to come with me"". This was minutes before the first pitch and left me out several hundred dollars.  
  
Last but not least, the dating scene has sucked. I am tall and white and would be considered by most to be conventionally attractive. I was hoping to find a long-term partner here, but most categorize me as a 'fuck boy' before we even have a serious conversation. I tried to ask out a classmate for coffee, but have heard through the rumor mill that she put me on blast in a group chat for having 'yellow fever'. It's been completely humiliating.    
  
I more or less just wanted to make this post as a warning sign to others who might be considering an MBA. If you're obsessed with prestige and are not into k-pop, anime, and trading card games - it's definitely possible that you'll have a bad time.  ",7,1752165724.0,MBA,19,0.61,False

Hello everyone. I'm just here to talk about the nature of addiction and breaking habits, but specifically nicotine addiction and the habit of smoking. And and and, also severing/breaking the addiction/habit.

Anyway, the last two months have been a strange experience. I took a week off from work (beginning May 11) to quit smoking and within that week made it three days. On those three days, I had ""quit"" tobacco/nicotine, caffeine, and refined sugar. In that time, I felt nothing of what I/we/society have been made to assume would be felt both physically and mentally once ceasing consumption of these chemicals/agents cold turkey, aside from a slightly lower mood. I put quit in quotation marks because I simply didn't have the funds to purchase these items, so for whatever reason, I'm not counting it.

Moving on, the day I got money (4th day), I was feeling great and got a coffee and donut. This set off a chain of feelings/urges and before you know it, I had a pack before I even purchased one (mentally). Since then I have made it 4 days and 1 day, but have been smoking the whole time up to today. 

I have kind of gotten myself in a bind because I am now smoking packs as opposed to buying cans of rolling tobacco with the idea that everyday is my last day. Realistically, I am probably smoking more now than I had been prior and, in turn, am spending more on the habit. I am also sleeping in a lot more which is because a) the first day anxiety and b) the tobacco store doesn't open until 8am. Moreover, I find that my ""last day"" mentality is extending into the caffeine and sugar/processed food habit, so, basically, my whole damn life is being effected by this in that I am a nicotine/food/sleep glutton. 

To the point, there are days when I wake up and feel fine as in I don't have that anxiety or any strong urge, but, rather, just say fuck it and go buy a pack. The night before, I am resolute and feel great about my choice to become a non-smoker and realize how fucking dumb this whole cycle is. Further, I have this vision of myself once I drop this/these habits and god damn is it different than my current situation and overall view of myself which I believe makes the process so daunting, invariably leading me to be paralyzed in relation to moving forward.

For some context, I am 38M, got dumped 6 months ago after a 6 year relationship and had to move back in with my mom who is by all accounts a toxic person, also relocated between states, have ADHD and some fun comorbidities that have lead to some not so great feelings of self-worth/efficacy, and I have my whole life ahead of me with no skills or credentials. Materially, life hasn't been too bad, but mentally, it has been a shit show. Above all, I just want to be a good person and have made some real strides in life to this regard. I quit drinking over 8 years ago and don't do drugs, but am still impulsive to say the least.

This is all to say that, in such a long winded manner, in those days when I have gone without all this stuff that I wish to move away from, I am not awash in stress nor am I in some heightened emotional state and that they have been really fucking easy, but, for some reason, I simply can't stick with the program. Speaking of which, it should be noted that I have read the Easy Way and have also used QuitSure. Despite my lack of success with this endeavor, I would highly recommend both. 

In conclusion, wish me luck for tomorrow for I have purchased my last pack this morning.",7,1752165619.0,quittingsmoking,2,1.0,False

We’re talking about weekend plans. You know, being cute, making future memories, maybe even wife him up someday.

And then, mid-sentence, this man looks me in the eyes… and calls me by his ex’s name.

Like it was a normal Tuesday and we were in a flashback episode of his past relationship.

My soul left my body. I saw stars. I saw her. I saw every argument they ever had and every vacation they ever took on Instagram.

And of course he immediately panicked. Said it was a “brain glitch.” Apologized like he just ran over my cat with a Roomba. I think he said sorry 27 times. Maybe more. Honestly I blacked out after the third one.

He says he hasn’t talked to her in years. That it meant nothing. That his brain was just on autopilot. Okay cool but why is your autopilot programmed for emotional turbulence sir

Now I’m here, drinking my iced coffee like everything’s fine but internally rebranding my personality just in case he secretly misses her taste in throw pillows or something.

Anyway. I told him I’m not mad and I meant it. I’m just gonna sit silently for the next few days like a haunted doll until the energy shifts in my favor.

Should I casually call him by my ex’s name next time we’re cuddling? Just for balance?

And by “friend” I mean me, currently staring out the window like I’m in a Lana Del Rey music video.

*Today's special early-post map set heralds the first of some semi-regular epic multi-level builds that I'm incredibly proud of. This 5-level map of Cornflower Alley is the culmination of around 80 hours work, and I hope you can make use of it!*

*There's another multi-level map lined up for Saturday 19th - a glorious tavern with galleried upper levels - and every so often after that (including an absolute gem of a castle that has taken 60 hours so far, a graveyard with a multi-level underground cave system, a lovely chapel with a soaring high roof inside, and more!)*

*Thank you for your support, I couldn't do this without you <3*

&nbsp;

**Welcome to Cornflower Alley – a tight and winding merchant-studded artery in the heart of a bustling city.**

With 12 individual buildings comprising of businesses at street level and residential use upstairs, there are 5 levels to the alley, running from cellar (with secret tunnel for the Mayor’s covert gambling habit!) right up to the very rooftops. Find meeting places, balconies, roof gardens, latrines-a-plenty, and even feathered friends!

You can tell a lot about the city by its thoroughfares, and anyone innocently entering Cornflower Alley at one end will emerge dazed and bewildered at the other, wondering where their coin purses have gone – whether emptied in the copious selection of shops selling toothsome treats, magical supplies, armour and weapons, beer and bacon, or pilfered by felonious thugs skulking in the shadows (surely soon to be visiting the town stocks or cells).

&nbsp;

Buildings include:

* The Grand Inn

* Butcher’s shop

* Baker’s shop

* Alchemist

* Magic shop

* Town Hall (with hidden passage!)

* Grocer & Florist

* Library

* Smithy

* Jail + stocks

* The Wonky Tavern

* Abandoned Building (former toy shop)

Is this the new trending way? 

Where are these guys getting their ai generated music from? So many of them have their accounts created in 2023+. I see almost none prior to that. They have a Spotify, bandcamp, and sometimes merchandise in their bio. 

Does this method actually generate a lot of revenue? You buy some AI music generative software,(choose some niche) —> then find some stupid generated “comfy” aesthetic art —> then upload your music with some generic sentence title. And watch the views and money roll in?

Complete Guide to Bahrain Company Formation & Office Requirements,"*Reuters* recently reported FDI inflows hit $1.6B in early 2025, bolstered by robust government reforms and fast-track company formation procedures ([Reuters Bahrain Economy](https://www.reuters.com/)).

The Economic Development Board (EDB) projects **GDP growth of 3.8% for 2025**, driven by digital commerce, fintech, and a significant move toward remote and flexible work models. Entrepreneurs are keenly asking: Do I still need a physical office for my CR?

*Spoiler: Yes and No—depending on your activity, business structure, and how you navigate the rules.*

# Firsthand: Why Entrepreneurs Want to Work from Home in Bahrain

I remember my team’s frustration: “Why pay BHD 400+ monthly for a Diplomatic Area office when our entire tech stack runs from our living rooms?” But the answer isn’t as simple as a “remote work” checkbox.

**Key reasons business owners prefer working from home:**

* Save on office rent, utilities, and furniture
* Avoid daily traffic snarls around Seef and Juffair
* Greater work-life balance—especially during Ramadan when business hours (and rhythms) shift
* Digital-first, service-based startups don’t actually *need* daily in-person meetings

However, Bahrain’s **Company Formation** laws and office requirements can be surprisingly nuanced.

# Understanding Bahrain Business License & Office Needs

# The Sijilat Puzzle: What Does the Law Say?

Many assume Bahrain’s Sijilat portal or the MOICT site will have a clear, unified answer. But official advice can vary—one officer at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOICT) may wave through a home business, another might demand a full commercial address.

# The 2025 Policy Update

*From January 2025*, Bahrain introduced a **Remote Business Permit** for select activities, including digital consultancy, graphic design, and certain types of e-commerce. ([Bahrain.com – Official Government Regulations](https://www.bahrain.com/)).

>Offices are still required for regulated activities—especially those involving client meetings, inventory, or regulated professional services.

# Common Business Structures & How They Impact Your Options

Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration, professionals in a meeting *Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, professionals in a meeting.*). These impact your flexibility with office requirements:

* **Single Person Company (SPC):** Allows full ownership and, with the new 2025 permit, flexible office arrangements for some activities.
* **With Limited Liability Company (WLL):** Still the most popular format, but usually requires a registered commercial address.
* **Branch Office:** Foreign firms establishing a branch must show evidence of a Bahrain address.
* **Freelancer License:** Popular among creatives and consultants; home office use possible but with restrictions.

*And speaking from experience: choosing the wrong entity can add months to your timeline and hundreds of BHD in wasted fees. Always match your structure to your real business needs.*

Read more about business types: [Bahrain Business Type Structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)

# Office Requirements: What’s Actually Enforced?

# The Traditional Rule

Historically, the **MOICT** mandated every company have a “commercial address”—which could range from a flex desk in Bahrain Bay to a full office floor in the Diplomatic Area. Even e-commerce or freelance CRs were pressured to show a lease.

# New Flexibility (But With Limits)

The **2025 Remote Business Permit** is a game-changer, but only for specific, low-impact activities. The catch? You’ll need:

* To apply for the correct activity codes on Sijilat
* A landlord NOC for home-based businesses (even if you own your flat!)
* Proof of utilities and proper business signage (yes, a sticker on your mailbox counts)

Importantly, if your work involves inventory, walk-in customers, or regulated advice, a dedicated office is still **non-negotiable.**

# Real Examples: Who Can & Cannot Work from Home

**Allowed to Work from Home (2025):**

* Digital consultants, marketers, web/app developers
* Graphic designers, content creators, certain freelancers
* E-commerce stores with drop-shipping or fulfillment-by-partner models (no local stock)

**Still Require an Office:**

* Law firms, regulated financial or accounting providers
* Retail shops with physical stock/inventory
* Medical centers, clinics, and any business requiring official inspection

*I once helped a friend set up a remote consulting CR; by securing an NOC from her landlord and choosing her activity carefully, she saved BHD 5,000+ over two years. But when we tried the same for an import/export venture, Sijilat flagged the application for office inspection and delayed the CR by two months. Lesson learned!*

# Step-by-Step: How to Legally Establish a Home-Based Business in Bahrain

# 1. Choose the Right Activity and Structure

* Use the [Sijilat](https://www.sijilat.bh/) database to confirm which activities are “remote-permitted.”
* Consult the [foreigner-allowed activity list](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/) if you are a non-Bahraini—some activities are 100% foreign-owned, others require a local partner.
* For remote-friendly sectors, consider an SPC for maximum ownership and flexibility.

# 2. Prepare Documents Early

Feature Image: Business process and documentation, preparing office paperwork *Alt text: Business process and documentation, preparing office paperwork.*

* Proof of address (utility bill or lease agreement)
* Landlord’s No Objection Certificate (NOC) for home-based business
* Clear business activity description—use official MOICT codes

**Time-saving hack:** Submit all scans in PDF format—Sijilat prefers this and moves your file faster.

# 3. Pick the Easiest Registration Path

* Go direct via Sijilat for simple digital services activities.
* Use [Keylink’s company formation guide](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) for step-by-step breakdowns.
* Apply during Ramadan mornings for shortest queues at Seef Mall’s MOICT branch (personal aside: I once waited just 12 minutes by showing up at 8:00am post-Suhoor. Timing is everything!)

# 4. Confirm Office Address Compliance

* For remote CRs: Home address, landlord NOC, and business signage required.
* For regulated sectors: Lease a small office at shared spaces like Regus (Bahrain Bay & Seef), which offers instant address letters and utilities in your company name.
* Free zones (limited in number, but worth exploring): [Free Zones in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/)

# 5. Register with LMRA and Tamkeen (if hiring staff)

* All commercial registrations must link to Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) portal if you plan to hire.
* Tamkeen offers fee waivers and business support, especially for remote-first businesses.

# 6. Post-Formation: Stay Compliant

* Annual renewal of commercial registration (CR)
* Timely submission of accounts—outsource to experts: [Bahrain Accounting & Bookkeeping](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)
* Watch for regulatory updates via [Bahrain.com](https://www.bahrain.com/) and [Gulf News: Bahrain](https://www.gulfnews.com/uae/bahrain)

# Cost Considerations: Home-Based vs. Conventional Office

Feature Image: Financial planning and costs, calculating business budget in Bahrain *Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculating business budget in Bahrain.*:\*\*

* Home Office Permit: **BHD 50–100/year** (just MOICT fees)
* Landlord NOC processing: **Free–BHD 20** (depending on agent)
* Shared office (virtual address at Regus, Seef): **BHD 40–80/month** for address + mail handling
* Dedicated office (Diplomatic Area, min. 20sqm): **BHD 320–600/month**
* Sijilat Activity Change (to enable remote working): **BHD 5–15** per update

>For a full comparison table and up-to-date fee info, check [Bahrain Company Formation Cost](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

*Pro tip: Save by negotiating annual leases or leveraging Tamkeen support for startups.*

# A Tangent: The Business Coffee Ritual

Straying briefly from paperwork—never underestimate Bahrain’s coffee culture. Majlis-style networking, especially in Seef’s lobby cafés, opens doors that emails rarely can. Once, a single shared qahwa led to an expedited landlord NOC. Relationships—more than just forms—grease the wheels of Bahrain business.

Surprisingly, Bahrain is more open than neighbors. **Foreigners can own up to 100% of their business in most sectors**—with documented approvals ([see allowed activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/) and [ownership limits](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)).

Compared to Saudi Arabia or the UAE (where local sponsorship rules can be complex), Bahrain’s approach is friendlier:

* No need for a “silent partner” in most digital or consulting businesses
* Local sponsorship only for specific, protected sectors ([Local Sponsorship Info](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/))

# Regulatory Compliance: Staying Safe & Audit-Ready

Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation, business regulations in Bahrain *Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, business regulations in Bahrain.*

* Display business signage—even if it’s just a nameplate at your apartment door
* File accounts annually, use [trusted Bahrain accountants](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)
* Prepare for surprise inspections

**Common mistake:** Many skip signage or fail to update Sijilat after moving flats. This can suspend your CR. Always update your address promptly.

# The Bahrain Advantage: Comparison with UAE & Saudi

Bahrain offers simpler registration, fewer residency hurdles, and (as of 2025) more remote-friendly activities than Dubai’s mainland or Riyadh. Free zones in Bahrain are smaller, but *you can launch a 100% foreign-owned consulting CR from your apartment—something that’s getting harder in neighboring countries.*

# Conclusion: Work from Home is Possible—If You Play by the Rules

The answer? **Yes, you can work from home with a Bahrain business license—but only for certain permitted activities and with the right paperwork.** Failing to match your activity and address to MOICT’s expectations will stall your journey.

*And for those tempted to cut corners—Bahrain’s inspectors are savvy. One missed step with signage or address updates can lead to frustrating delays. Get your documents in order, nurture your coffee shop connections, and you’ll save both time and money.*

# FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Office Requirements

# Can I use my residential address for my Bahrain commercial registration (CR)?

*Yes, if your business activity is eligible for the Remote Business Permit introduced in 2025. You’ll need a landlord NOC and must display appropriate signage. For regulated activities, a dedicated office remains mandatory. See* [*Bahrain Company Formation Process*](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) *for details.*

# What are the cheapest office solutions for new companies in Bahrain?

*Home office permits cost as little as BHD 50–100/year for eligible sectors. For others, virtual office providers like Regus in Seef or Bahrain Bay offer address-only packages from BHD 40/month. Compare costs here:* [*Bahrain Company Formation Cost*](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/)*.*

# Can foreigners own 100% of a Bahrain-based company working from home?

*Usually yes—most professional, consulting, and digital activities allow 100% foreign ownership with remote work. Some sectors still require a Bahraini partner or local agent. See activity-specific rules:* [*Foreigner Friendly Activities*](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)*.*

# What documents are required for remote company registration in Bahrain?

* Valid passport & CPR (for residents)
* Lease agreement or proof of home address
* Landlord NOC (for home-based CR)
* MOICT-approved activity description
* Signed application forms (see [Commercial Registration Requirements](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/))

# Is ongoing compliance more difficult for remote businesses?

*In some ways, yes—as inspectors may check you’re not breaching your CR permissions by storing inventory or receiving unsanctioned visitors. Keep all accounting and address records updated. Outsourcing to a* [*local accounting firm*](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) *can prevent costly mistakes.*

# Best Folding Bike and Bag [2025]: Reviews & Guide

Folding bikes have revolutionized urban commuting and recreational cycling, offering a unique blend of portability and practicality. Choosing the right folding bike can dramatically improve your daily life, and the addition of a purpose-built bag enhances its convenience even further. This guide will explore the best folding bikes and bags of 2025, providing detailed reviews and essential details to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated folding bike and bag on Amazon.]](https://site.healthytargeting.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=folding bike and bag)

## Key Features Analysis

The key to selecting the perfect folding bike lies in understanding its features and how they align with your specific needs. This section dives into the technical aspects of top models available in 2025.

**Folding Mechanism:** A secure and easy-to-use folding mechanism is paramount.The best folding bikes utilize patented locking systems that ensure stability while riding and swift folding and unfolding operation. top models feature hinges made from high-strength aluminum alloys and require minimal tools or adjustments. These complex designs minimize the likelihood of accidental unlocking.

**Frame Material and Geometry:** The choice of frame material significantly impacts the bike's weight, durability, and ride quality. Lightweight aluminum alloys like 6061 or 7005 are common, providing a good balance between strength and weight. Carbon fiber frames offer superior weight savings but come at a higher price point.Frame geometry influences how the bike handles, with more relaxed angles offering greater stability and steeper angles delivering a more responsive feel.

**Wheel Size and Gearing:** Wheel size affects the bike's maneuverability and rolling efficiency. Smaller wheels (16 or 20 inches) make for a more compact folded size but may require more pedaling effort to maintain speed. larger wheels (24 or 26 inches) offer a smoother ride and better rolling efficiency but increase the overall size. Gearing systems range from single-speed to multi-speed options, with internal hub gears offering greater reliability and lower maintenance compared to traditional derailleurs.

**Braking System:** Reliable braking is crucial for safety, especially in urban environments. Disc brakes,both mechanical and hydraulic,provide superior stopping power and performance in all weather conditions compared to traditional rim brakes. Hydraulic disc brakes offer more responsive feel and consistent performance. Though, rim brakes are frequently enough lighter and easier to maintain.

**Bag Design and Materials:** the accompanying bag's design dictates how convenient it is to carry and store the folded bike. Durable, water-resistant materials like nylon or polyester are essential to protect the bike. Features to look for include padded shoulder straps, carrying handles, and additional pockets for accessories. Some bags are designed for rolling transport, adding another layer of convenience.

Key features of the leading folding bikes and bags include:

* Compact folding size for easy storage and transportation
* Lightweight frame materials for enhanced portability
* Multiple gear options for versatile riding
* Reliable braking systems for safety
* Durable and convenient bag design for protection

## Core Benefits

The benefits of owning a folding bike extend beyond simple transportation. These bikes enhance convenience,promote fitness,and offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional modes of transport.

**Enhanced Portability:** folding bikes excel in portability, enabling users to seamlessly integrate cycling into their daily routines.You can easily fold the bike and carry it onto public transportation, store it in a small apartment, or stow it in the trunk of a car. This adaptability eliminates common barriers to cycling and opens up new possibilities for commuting and recreation.

**Increased Convenience:** The convenience of a folding bike is undeniable. Rather of relying on bike racks or worrying about theft, you can keep your bike safely stored indoors, whether at home, at work, or in a coffee shop. This peace of mind encourages more frequent use and eliminates the stress associated with traditional bike ownership. Riding to a train station and then easily folding your bike onto the train is much more convenient than relying on parking or taxi services.

**Improved Fitness and Health:** Regular cycling is a great way to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle, and boost overall fitness. Folding bikes make it easier to incorporate cycling into your daily routine, even if you have limited space or access to traditional bike storage. The convenience factor encourages more frequent use, leading to tangible health benefits.

**Environmentally friendly Commuting:** Choosing a folding bike over a car for short to medium-distance commutes significantly reduces your carbon footprint. It's a enduring transportation option that contributes to cleaner air and reduced traffic congestion. This environmental consciousness aligns with a growing desire for greener lifestyles.

## FAQs Section

Folding bikes present unique considerations compared to traditional bikes.Addressing common questions helps prospective buyers make informed decisions.

**What is the ideal folded size for easy storage?**
The ideal folded size depends on your storage constraints. Typically,a folding bike with dimensions around 30” x 24” x 12” is considered compact enough for most apartments and car trunks. However, some ultra-compact models fold even smaller, albeit often with compromises in ride quality.

**How heavy is too heavy for a folding bike to carry comfortably?**
Pleasant carrying weight is subjective, but most users find that a folding bike weighing between 22 and 28 pounds is manageable for short distances. Lighter models made from carbon fiber or high-end aluminum alloys are easier to carry but come at a premium price. Consider your carrying distance and physical strength when evaluating the weight.

**Are folding bikes as durable and safe as regular bikes?**
Modern folding bikes are designed with safety and durability in mind. High-quality models use robust frame materials, reliable components, and secure locking mechanisms. While they may not be as rugged as dedicated mountain bikes,they are more than capable of handling urban riding and occasional recreational use. Regular maintenance and inspections are crucial to ensure continued safe operation.

## Ideal User Profile

Folding bikes cater to a diverse range of users with varying needs and lifestyles. Identifying your user profile helps narrow down the selection process.

The whole festival had such a heartfelt, handmade feel to it — you could tell that everything was done with love. It wasn’t polished in the commercial sense, but that’s exactly what made it so beautiful.

Let’s talk about the coffee — the American guy serving it? Absolutely excellent. Probably the best I’ve ever had at a festival. And the food? Every single stand had great options, but the Asian food was a standout. Super tasty, fresh, and comforting after a long night of dancing.

The decorations were magical. So many little details to discover everywhere — it felt like a living, breathing art installation. You could tell the people behind this really care about the experience.

We were lucky to arrive early enough to get a shady camping spot in the woods, which was perfect. We brought our own bathroom setup, so I can’t really speak to the condition of the WCs or showers — maybe someone else can fill that in.

Now, the only thing that stood out as a downside (or maybe just a note for next time): the music was LOUD. Like, really loud — to the point where it was mostly bass that you could hear. But hey, this isn’t a commercial giant like Ozora. It’s run by passionate people, not a big corporation, and that rawness really gives it its charm.

If you’re into DIY vibes, a tight-knit community, and art made with soul — this one’s for you.

I’m looking for a resort that has toddler-friendly activities (like splash pads, indoor play areas, wading pools, etc.), but also entertainment for adults (shows, music, etc.).

After extensive research, it seems that Majestic Elegance has the best food, but it doesn’t appear to have a coffee shop, an ice cream shop, or water slides for adults, which is a big letdown. The waterslides I’ve seen in photos look relatively small. While I know Majestic Colonial is more family-oriented, Majestic Elegance has better reviews.

Lopesan looks beautiful, but I’ve read a lot of negative reviews about the staff being rude and the beach smelling like diesel due to the many boats in the water.

Dreams Flora looks great, but the resort seems quite small, so I’m worried there won’t be enough activities. The pool area for water volleyball looks narrow, and the lobby doesn’t have air conditioning, which is a downside.

Right now, Dreams Macao is my top choice. It has waterslides for adults, a huge kiddie pool area, and a lazy river. Plus, the beach is more of a surfer beach, so the adults will be able to boogie board, which is a bonus!

Nobody warned us about this part of adulting:
You do everything right —
You build the career, pay the bills, stay productive, answer “I’m fine” like a pro…
And yet, it’s 2am, and your soul feels like an abandoned house with the lights still on.
After I wrote “No One Warns You About the Loneliness of Doing Everything Right,”
a tech CEO messaged me:
“You exposed the wound. But here’s the deeper truth — I built this prison myself. Every time I said ‘I don’t need help,’ I laid another brick.”

That line broke me.
Because it’s true. Loneliness isn’t fate — it’s something we build every time we choose performance over connection.
Here’s how I’m starting to tear the walls down:
🧱 1. I stopped lying when people asked ‘How are you?’
Instead of “busy but crushing it,” I tried,

“Honestly, today feels heavy. Want to grab coffee?”
You’d be amazed how fast walls fall when you go first.
👥 2. I built a “Human Triad”:
One friend who makes me laugh until I snort.
One who survived burnout and tells me hard truths.
One who texts me, “You’ve ghosted for 3 weeks. Spill.”
Without them, I vanish into my own silence.
🧺 3. I turned chores into connection.
Paid bills over FaceTime with a friend.
Swapped meals with a neighbor.
Even folding laundry next to someone on mute felt... less alone.
Science backs it — shared boring tasks release oxytocin (the “belonging” chemical). Who knew?
🎮 4. I started acting “immature” on purpose.
Played Fortnite. Built a pillow fort.
Watched cartoons.
Sent memes to people I hadn’t spoken to in months.
Laughed harder than I have in years.
One woman DMed me
:
“Thanks for posting that. You gave me permission to play again.
”
✉️ 5. I sent one scary, honest te
xt:
“Remember that time we [funny memory]? I still laugh. Coffee soon?”
Not everyone replied. But the ones who did? Mag
ic.
I’m done pretending loneliness is normal.
It’s not.
It’s a wall — and I’m tearing it down one brick at a time.
If you’re tired of being the “strong one,”
Try this:
✅ Text someone who made you feel joy
✅ Do one “unprofessional” thing this week and post it with #LonelinessRebellion
✅ Build your triad. Jester, Sage, Mirror. You need a
ll 3.
The bravest adulting move isn’t having your shit together.
It’s saying: “I’m not a fortress. I’m a human. And I miss feeling al
ive.”

Also! As someone brand new to SW, would anyone be willing to share what a first interaction with new fans might look like? And what about promoting drives people to click that link? I’ve gotten some DMs here on Reddit that just seem like they want to chat, but read that we probably shouldn’t be answering DMs here. 

I apologize for the couple extra questions, they don’t seem worthy of their own post and I was mostly just curious how everyone is using their bios to get fans on the hook so to speak. Thanks so much!!

As I was watching it, I kept thinking that the woman playing Andrew's mother looked super familiar, and then the credits roll, and it's Catherine Coulson! And she is great as always, but what made me laugh, was that her character works in a diner, pouring coffee. I kept wondering if she ever had to scrape spruce gum out of the booths lol

I’ve learned over the years that what you bring with you can make or break your shift especially on those long, slow, or downright chaotic days.

Here’s what I keep in my bag

Snacks – Granola bars, mixed nuts, jerky. You never know when you’ll get a break, so having something quick to eat helps keep the energy up.

Chargers – Phone charger, extra radio battery if you have one, and a backup battery pack. Dead comms or phones can be annoying and dangerous

Flashlight – Primary flashlight, backup flashlight, and fresh batteries for both. I’ve had my main light die mid-patrol more than once.

Energy boost – I usually rotate between a small thermos of coffee or a couple cans of energy drinks. Some people swear by tea or even electrolyte drinks. Find what works for you.

Notepad and pens – Even if your site uses digital reporting, always have a notepad. You’ll end up needing to jot down info at some point.

Forms – Keep a couple copies of incident reports, visitor logs, or any site-specific paperwork you might need. Saves you a trip back to the office or post.

Medical kit – A basic first aid kit is a must. I also carry some over the counter stuff like ibuprofen, allergy meds, and cold relief enough to get through a shift if something flares up.

Miscellaneous- Gloves, hand sanitizer, chapstick, rain poncho, and an extra pair of socks if it’s a long shift or you’re outside a lot.


Your duty bag should be prepped to make your shift easier and keep you sane, especially when you’re solo, working remote sites, or stuck somewhere with no resources.

GAD diagnosis several years ago. Years of therapy but now incorporating meds into therapy. I’m taking bupropion for my anxiety. When it was prescribed, I did some research on interactions and saw caffeine listed everywhere as an interaction, both lowering the seizure threshold as well as potentially increasing anxiety with consumption. I cut out all caffeine as recommended (by my google search). No coffee, no tea, no soda. I saw it was recommended to even cut out chocolate, but I’m not sure how legit that is. 

Anyway, my question is **how much caffeine is okay to consume when on bupropion?** Is it still safe for me to consume decaf coffee, since it contains a bit (although much less than regular) of caffeine? Or chocolate? Or like a London fog tea every once in a while?

I’m trying to choose between two coffee machines for home use, and I’d love some honest opinions from people who’ve used either of them.

✅ The two models I’m considering (both around ₹8,000–₹9,000 on Amazon India):

1. Costar 2-in-1 Espresso Machine

- Works with ground coffee and Nespresso Original pods
- 20-bar pump
- No steam wand or frother
-Simple button-based interface
- Known for strong espresso shots (supposedly better taste)

2. InstaCuppa 3-in-1 Espresso Coffee Maker

- Works with ground coffee and generic pods
- Built-in milk frother and kettle mode for hot water
- 20-bar pressure (thermoblock)
- Self-cleaning feature
- LED touchscreen display

💭 What matters to me:

- Good espresso flavor (like café-style crema if possible)
- Convenience (easy cleaning is a plus)
- I occasionally drink milk-based coffee and matcha
- Not super serious about perfect coffee, but I do care about taste
---

❓️If anyone owns either of these, especially in India, what’s your experience been like?
❓️Which one is better in the long run?
❓️Does the InstaCuppa taste weaker or is the difference small?
❓️Does Costar require a lot of cleanup/maintenance?
❓️Can the frother on InstaCuppa actually make good lattes or is it gimmicky?

Any help would be much appreciated!

1lwh3qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteworkersbackpain/comments/1lwh3qa/i_recently_battled_the_worst_back_flareup_just/,I recently battled the worst back flare-up just for you to learn this,"Last week I got hit with a nasty bug that knocked me flat...



But here's what really got me... it wasn't just the fever or the headache that had me worried.



It was how my lower back completely seized up. 

The inflammation from being sick triggered the worst flare-up I've had in months.



I couldn't sleep at all last night. 

Every position hurt. 

Every movement sent shooting pain down my spine.



Sound familiar?



Here's what I learned about inflammation and back pain that most people miss...



When your body fights infection, it creates system-wide inflammation. And guess where that inflammation loves to settle? Your weakest spots.



For those of us with back issues, getting sick doesn't just mean a few days of rest. It means weeks of recovery.



But here's what I did this morning to start turning things around...



First, I flooded my system with water. 

Not coffee, not juice... pure water. 

Dehydration makes inflammation worse.



Then I did 5 minutes of gentle movement. Not stretching, not exercise... just slow, careful mobility work to get blood flowing.



Next, I ate anti-inflammatory foods. 

Berries, leafy greens, and healthy fats. 

Your body needs the right fuel to heal.



Finally, I spent 10 minutes doing deep breathing exercises. Stress hormones fuel inflammation, and breathing helps calm your nervous system.



The result? I'm already feeling 50% better than I did 12 hours ago.



Here's the truth about healing that nobody talks about...



Setbacks are part of the journey. Your body isn't broken just because you have bad days.



The difference between people who recover and people who stay stuck isn't avoiding setbacks... it's having the right tools to bounce back quickly.



If you're dealing with chronic back pain and want to make a change to your well-being, comment ""RELIEF"" and I will send you a lower back self assessment.

I'll show you how to keep your back healthy, even when life tries to knock you down.",1,1752164783.0,remoteworkersbackpain,0,1.0,False

But - when I moved up to 1mg I found the symptoms - diarrhea and vomiting - were just amplified and I really struggled. I really struggled having my favourite things - coffee and wine - tasted horrendous to me (don't shoot me down, I just like a few glasses at the weekend). I am v social too so eating out/having a few drinks was just a bust. I had a burger and 2 wine spritz one night and was chucking up every 2 mins, just horrid.

Anyway, I came off it and inevitably gained 10lb straight away 😆 and struggled to reverse it for the last 9 months. Upon research I decided to try Rybelsus and I am currently on 7mg with only minimal side effects (dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, but nothing too extreme).

The weight loss has not been amazing - I have only lost about 6 lbs and I have come back from holiday actually 2lb heavier than I went. So 4lb for 2 months expense - £340/$460 However, on the upside, it has limited my appetite and I have not done my usual holiday 'fuck it' and ate everything plus sides. So it has helped me stay controlled and I still enjoyed all the good stuff without going OTT.

However, to the point. So my provider has said they are no longer providing Rybelsus for weight loss and want to switch me to Wegovy. They suggested 1mg as it's the Rybelsus 7mg equivalent. I raised that I struggled in this last time and they said I am welcome to go back to 0.5 no issues. My qu for your thoughts are - on the equivalent dose of Ryblesus my side effects are minimal. As my body is now used to it shall I just go for 1mg? Or go back to 0.5mg? What would you do/have done if you have experienced this?

For context: 
- I am 5'2"" and original SW 176lb
- Wegovy Jan-May 2024 lost approx 21lb
- Off Wegovy gained 10lb back
- Started Rybelsus May 2025, SW 163lb
- CW 159lb

I know it's not super heavy but being small I am still in that overweight BMI (although we all know BMI is shite)

I know I look and feel waaayyyy better when I am 134lb max, pref 127 ish. I'll even settle for 140 😆

I have struggled big time for the last 8 years as I have gotten a bit older, now 43 (F) with eating little and still gaining. My husband even comments on how little I eat compared to him, 1200kcal most days it's so frustrating. Sema definitely help me stay more consistent and prob below the 1200 cals. I easily make 10k + steps most days.

Any thoughts appreciated.

I’m 23F, Canadian, married, and the exhausted-but-glamorous mother of a dog and a drama-drenched yorkie. Think gremlincore meets “law student with a superiority complex” that’s the energy. I’m deep in law school, obsessed with true crime, and I physically cannot stay quiet when someone waives their right to counsel. Get a lawyer, idiot.

What I like:
Copaganda, messy interrogation footage, horror movies, courtroom drama, and watching the justice system unravel in real time. Oh and sewing. I stitch frogs, dragons, and scrunchies. If you’re a fellow artist you know that art fight has been BUSYYY.

What I’m looking for:
	•	People who wanna analyze body cam/interrogation vids like we’re prepping closing arguments
	•	Someone to hang on Discord with while I sew stuff that may or may not be haunted
	•	Texting and unfiltered voice notes about anything life, law, love, trauma, iced coffee rankings
	•	Queer, weird, horror-loving, cozy-chaotic souls highly encouraged
	•	Haters and life-complainers welcome. Extra points if you’re funny when you’re mad

Not always available for calls, but I live in the text zone. If you’re bored, overly opinionated, and want to talk shit while I stitch a plushie, come say hi",1,1752164406.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,4,0.67,False
