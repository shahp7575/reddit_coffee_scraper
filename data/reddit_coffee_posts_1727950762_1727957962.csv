# Introduction

Honestly, if you‚Äôve ever wrestled with a traditional inkjet printer, you know the struggle is real. Those ink cartridges seem to dry up the moment you look at them, and let‚Äôs not even get started on the endless setup procedures that can leave you scratching your head. That‚Äôs why when I stumbled upon the **Canon MF644Cdw**, I felt a flicker of hope. This printer claims to tackle all the annoying printer woes‚Äîprinting, scanning, copying, and even faxing. Sounds dreamy, right? So, let‚Äôs dive into this all-in-one wonder and see if it lives up to the hype.

# Product Overview

https://preview.redd.it/ar1mkui49jsd1.jpg?width=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da53819f5cf7fde6066efe208b981245b0fcb00a

# Key Features

The **Canon MF644Cdw** boasts a bunch of impressive features that caught my attention:

* **4-in-1 Functionality:** Print, copy, scan, and fax‚Äîall in one sleek machine. Who doesn‚Äôt love a multitasker?
* **Fast Printing Speed:** It prints up to 22 pages per minute in both black and color, which is kind of impressive.
* **Quick First Print:** Your first print is ready in about 10.3 seconds. That‚Äôs quicker than some people make breakfast!
* **High Capacity Toner:** It uses Toner 067 / 067 High Capacity Toner, so you won‚Äôt be running to the store every few weeks for replacements.
* **Versatile Paper Handling:** With a 250-sheet standard cassette and a 1-sheet multipurpose tray, plus a 50-sheet automatic document feeder for two-sided scanning, it can handle whatever you throw at it.

# Many of us need one!

This printer seems tailor-made for anyone from busy parents trying to print school projects to small business owners needing a reliable workhorse. If you‚Äôre looking for something that just works, this might be it.

# My Finds:

# Pros

* **High Print Quality:** The prints are sharp and vibrant‚Äîseriously, they could rival dedicated photo printers.
* **Fast Operation:** With quick printing and scanning, you‚Äôll save loads of time, which is, honestly, the dream.
* **User-Friendly Setup:** Most folks find the setup a breeze. No more crying over complicated instructions!
* **Versatile Connectivity:** Supports various printing options like Canon PRINT Business, Apple AirPrint, and Mopria Print Service. Printing from your phone? Yes, please!
* **Three-Year Warranty:** Peace of mind with a robust warranty. It‚Äôs like having a safety net for your printer.

# Cons

* **Initial Setup Complexity:** I‚Äôm not entirely sure why, but some users struggle with setting up features like scan-to-email. It seems a bit wonky.
* **Print Speed for Photos:** While it handles documents like a champ, high-quality photo printing can take a smidge longer.
* **Customer Support Issues:** A few customers have reported a real headache trying to reach Canon's customer support. Yikes.

# In-Depth Review

# Performance

The **Canon MF644Cdw** truly excels in performance. Right out of the box, I was blown away by the quality of the prints. I mean, when someone says, ‚ÄúPrints came out perfect right out of the box,‚Äù you start to believe in miracles. The colors pop and the detail is impressive for everyday use.

# Design and Build Quality

The solid build feels like it could withstand a small tornado‚Äîokay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea. The touch screen? Pretty intuitive. But I have to admit, sometimes the response feels a bit sluggish, like when you‚Äôre waiting for your coffee to brew on a Monday morning.

# Ease of Use

Setting up the printer was generally straightforward. Most users report a smooth wireless connection setup, which I appreciated. It supports both Windows and Mac systems, making it versatile. Plus, printing from apps? Game changer! I was able to print a last-minute birthday card while still in my pajamas, which was kind of a win.

# Value for Money

At around $349, I think this printer offers fantastic value, especially given all its capabilities. It stands out among similar products, combining features and performance that make it worth every penny.

# User Feedback

# Customer Reviews

The feedback has been largely positive. Many users rave about its print quality and ease of use. One user even said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I took a chance on it based on even worse reviews for other comparable brands.‚Äù Talk about low expectations! Others noted that the **Canon MF644Cdw** is a significant upgrade from their previous inkjet printers.

# Ratings

This printer has received solid ratings‚Äîusually around 4 to 5 stars. That‚Äôs a good indicator of customer satisfaction, I‚Äôd say.

# Comparisons

While the **Canon MF644Cdw** holds its own, some users have compared it to Brother printers. Canon seems to have the upper hand when it comes to color accuracy and overall print quality, but Brother models might edge out in scanning capabilities. It‚Äôs like comparing apples to oranges, really.

# Who Should Buy This Product?

If you‚Äôre hunting for a reliable, multi-functional device that delivers high-quality prints without the usual inkjet drama, the **Canon MF644Cdw** is your guy. Whether you‚Äôre a busy professional or a parent cranking out school projects, it‚Äôs designed to meet a variety of needs.

# Conclusion

To sum it all up, the **Canon MF644Cdw** seems to be a strong contender for the title of best all-in-one photo printer. Its features, solid performance, and positive user feedback make it a worthwhile investment. I mean, if you‚Äôre looking for something that handles various tasks while delivering quality results, this model is definitely worth a look.

# Now‚Ä¶

are you ready to streamline your printing tasks? Consider the **Canon MF644Cdw** for your home or office. Check it out on amazon!

# FAQs

**1. How does this product compare to Brother printers?** While both brands offer excellent all-in-one capabilities, the **Canon MF644Cdw** is noted for superior color accuracy and print quality, especially for everyday documents and photos.

**2. What warranty or guarantee is offered?** The **Canon MF644Cdw** comes with a three-year limited warranty, providing added peace of mind for users.

**3. Are there any accessories that are recommended to use with this product?** While the printer includes essential components, consider investing in high-capacity toner cartridges to reduce the frequency of replacements and maximize efficiency.

This combination can lead to irregular heartbeats and an excessively rapid heart rate, which may result in hospitalization or even DEATH. I am not trying to nitpick anything I promise

1fv676h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1fv676h/the_long_crossing_lofotens_norway/,"The Long Crossing - Lofotens, Norway","**Where:** Lofoten Islands, Norway 


**When:** 31st August - 13th September


**Distance:** ~105 miles


**Links:**
Pictures: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/robertcoleuwn/)


**Trail info:** *""Since Rando-Lofoten was founded a certain number of visitors have told us they would be interested in a trekking itinerary that crosses the archipelago from one end to the other. Crossing a region from north to south or east to west often enables travellers to set themselves a goal when faced with the unknown. But over and above the physical or psychological challenge we believe it is important to remember that hiking is above all about discovery and enjoyment.""* [Source](https://rando-lofoten.net/en/the-long-crossing-from-north-to-south-on-the-lofoten-islands)


I was looking for a Scandinavian hike to go on with my partner, while she has been on multi day bike packing trips, this would be her first multi-day hike. The Long Crossing seemed to provide a perfect mix of a beautiful landscape, nice trail notes, and ruggedness without super long food carries or being too far from bail out points.


**Getting there/back:** We flew from London to Oslo then Oslo to Bod√∏. From Bod√∏ we took a ferry to Moskenes. On the way out our flight from London was delayed enough that we were going to miss the connection up to Bod√∏, but SAS were brilliant. They rebooked us onto the first flight the next day and put us up in a decent hotel outside Oslo airport. We ended up getting to Bod√∏ in time to catch the ferry that we originally planned to get.

The way back was pretty similar however we got the ferry from Svolv√¶r to Bod√∏. This time the weather was kicking off and the crossing was _rough_. It turns out I do get seasick, I just had never been in rough seas before. It was a lot of fun, but yeah, I puked three times...
Booking the ferry tickets was a little tricky, I still can't track down the website I actually bought the tickets from. The website I keep getting back to just gives you details on timing etc. However, tickets are easy to buy on the boats themselves which wasn't an issue for us but could be during more peak season.


**Resupply and water:** Resupply was simple. The most food we carried was 3 days and there were plenty of options in the supermarkets. Gas was easy to buy as well as decent dehydrated meals and all the usually snacks a hiker could want.
Water is everywhere, I didn't treat mine but my partner used a sawyer. A minor challenge is keeping eye out for brackish water as the route bounces around a host of lakes and salt water shore lines, but this is easy to check on a map.


**Navigation:** We both had caltopo loaded on our phones which as local topo maps for Norway! I also made paper maps on caltopo which were printed out and used for the bulk of out navigation. The route isn't way marked so you do have to keep an eye on the maps and there were a few games of 'trail or stream'


**Accommodation and camping:** There are plenty of places to stay on the islands and the decent bus network means that if you wanted to it is easy to travel a bit to get to hard accommodation. We camped or stayed in bivi huts every night bar the half way point when we took the bus from Leknes to Ballstad to stay in some cheaper hard accommodation. We also stayed one night in the paid campsite in Ramberg. This place was great! There is a kitchen and the showers and laundry were included in the price. 
Dispersed/wild Camping is free and easy. However, while camping in Norway is allowed in most places you can't simply camp *anywhere*. The Lofotens are getting a lot more tourists these days and it seems like camping where you shouldn't is starting to have an impact. In some places there are signs to highlight the rules. [There is a great website](https://nordlandsatlas.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=fab455cbf6e8441894efd4ccc99a0b8f) that highlights where you can and can't camp.
We came across a number of three sided shelters and stayed in one of them. They are not as deep as the ones on the AT so might not be great if the weather is coming in from the wrong direction, some have tarps you can string up if this is happening but the one we stayed in didn't. There are also a handful of proper huts that can be stayed in, a number need a key that can be got in advance from a nearby town or village but we didn't use any of these. We did stay in a beautiful turfed hut one night which was very well equipped. It's maintained by a local hunting and fishing group so didn't require a key. It was a shame that it wasn't colder as it had a stove in there, but we would have roasted if it was lit!


**Trail traffic:** Lightish. The normal sort of pattern, things got busier around access points and the main attractions. We met a handful of people out to do the Long Crossing which was fun, always nice to chat about sections and muse over what is to come.
One section that traffic may be an issue is the ridge running from Matmora towards Delp. This was our last day and we camped near by and got over the ridge fairly early, however, it seems like a lot of day hikers come up from Delp and hike the ridge towards Matmora. It might not be too fun trying to pass a group coming the other way on some parts of the ridge, especially if you're a little nervous on more exposed, steeper trail. It could be good to do this section either early or late to avoid having to deal with this when heading towards Delp.


**Conditions:** This took me by surprise a little, we hadn't looked into the finer underfoot conditions in too much detail. It is often boggy and wet feet were the norm. The bog can be deep and where there is more foot traffic things get muddy and slippy pretty fast. There is also a good bit of rock hopping as well as sections that have chains or ropes to help with climbing/descending. On the whole there was more rough ground than maintained trail. There were two ridge sections that could be tough for those who are a little more nervous with exposure, the ridge mentioned above as well as one coming down from Dalstuva. My parenter is less happy on this sort of ground but managed really well!
There are also a few sections of road walking. These aren't bad and we opted to walk all the quieter roads, but did catch busses/hitch hiked rather than walking along the E10 which is the main road on the islands. Seeing as I'm writing about public transport here, there is also a section where a ferry is needed*. If you're going Delp -> √Ö then this is a quick ~20 min ride from Kirkfjorden to Vinstad. However, if you're going √Ö -> Delp then you need to get the ferry from Vinstad to Reine then Reine to Kirkfjorden. This isn't a problem as Reine is a nice spot with a cafe, Bistro, and petrol station. So you can use the time there to have a hot meal or do a small resupply. There is also a supermarket there, but it looked like it might be tight to get there and back in time for the second ferry.
Weather wise we had packed and mentally prepared for rain, it can get pretty stormy up there. However, we lucked out on that front and only really had a couple of wet periods the entire time. Wind was the major factor and dictated where we camped a lot. Luckily using a combo of Yr, the Norwegian weather app, and Windy we were able to pick up some pretty good places to finish our days and while there were some good blowly nights we managed to shelter from the worst of it. The temps never dropped below freezing and the coldest it got during the day was probably around 10C, give or take a few either side. So the it was pretty cozy but with some rain and wind chill thrown in it could have been cold.


*I say needed but there is a way to hike over that [Swami mentions](https://www.thehikinglife.com/2020/02/the-long-crossing-of-norways-lofoten-islands/) in his write up. We didn't take nor did we meet anyone who had: 


**Gear:** Not much to put here but I did want to use this to write an ode to older gear. On the run up to this trip we couldn't get hold of a two person tent so ended up taking my old Golite Shangri-La 3. I love this tent. It's not ultralight by modern standards, especially when using the net inner but it can really handle some wind. We ended up nick naming it The Limpet as when it's pitched as low as it can go it really sticks to the ground. It was palatial for the two of us but meant we could roll back the inner in the mornings to brew our coffee inside when it was raining. 
Clothing wise I was really happy with my layering set up. I wore a Montane Allez then had an alpha direct 60 as an additional active layer and a montbell chameece for the evenings or if it got really cold. I didn't need to were everything at any point but it was nice to know that I would have been toasty if the weather had turned sour. The last couple of years I've found myself mostly hiking in hotter, drier places so I have been wearing a sun hoody a lot of the time and had almost forgotten about the montane allez. It's an awesome fleece. I have great faith in the micro grid polartech material which feels old fashioned and quaint in the world of alpha direct and that other one I forget the name of. But it's a tough, warm, and no-nonsense material. Since getting back the UK I've been on some very wet short trips to Wales and have really enjoyed the allez on those trips.
I don't have a gear list for this trip! 


**Concluding thoughts:** This was a brilliant trip to a beautiful part of the world. I'm still pinching myself about how much we saw the sun and blue skies. It was a lot of fun to get an old tent out of storage and put it to good use! I'm thinking about future trips to Norway as it was a seriously stunning place to hike and the mainland looks like it could be a wonderful place to adventure!",1,1727957500.0,Ultralight,0,1.0,False

1fv646h,https://i.redd.it/oi7j6t6z7jsd1.jpeg,Praise the Lord! Passed 1st attempt ,"I passed the PE Transportation exam on my first try!!! I wanted to make this post because I was obsessed with this subreddit during my preparation, as I found all the experiences, tips, and tricks so valuable. I wanted to share my two cents and return the favor to anyone else who might be going through this long and stressful, but so worth it, process.

First of all, I don‚Äôt consider myself the brightest person nor the best test taker, but I do have a lot of discipline when I want to conquer a goal, and this was definitely one of those. One thing that kept me going all this time was something I heard others say: study hard once and get it done. I think I made a lot of sacrifices the past months, but man, it was so worth it to see that green when I got the results. Here are all the details I can think of, and I am more than happy to answer any questions, as I probably asked over a hundred questions the past months.

I started to study in mid-February, about once a week for about an hour to ease into the ‚Äústudy mode.‚Äù I did that until the end of May, totaling 32.5 hours over 28 days. During this time, I used these practice exams: NCEES 2017 and 2023, PE sample exam 2nd and 5th edition, Six Minute Solution 5th and 2nd edition.

After doing that, I started the EET course for transportation. I bought the 16-week course. I started with the lectures and would pause and solve every practice problem before they went through the solution. After each section, I would work on the quiz and move on to the next section. I was trying to study at least 1.5 hours each day and more on the weekends. I completed all the lectures, problems, and quizzes in 9 weeks (yes, I know I was pushing myself). In those 9 weeks, I took a total of 6 days off with no study at all. I would say EET was extremely helpful to help me truly understand the concepts and questions. Samir was wonderful. He would get back to my questions super quick and did a great job explaining everything. 

After those 9 weeks, I started the whole course again. I did not rewatch the lectures, but I reviewed all the notes/slides and redid every single problem and quiz. I finished that process at the end of August, leaving about a month until my exam. I took about a week to redo all the exams that I worked on from February to May just to see if I had improved and to have some problem variety. I would say at that point, I was ready to take the exam, but my exam was scheduled for the end of September, so I had to wait.

During the last month, I redid all the quizzes about two more times each to the point where I knew exactly what was going on and made sure the mistakes I had made before were corrected. For the last three weeks, I did full exams to simulate the real exam. The last week, I just reviewed my notes and the problems I had gotten wrong in the past. The last three days, I focused on my notes on key points and revisited all the references (tables and figures) for each manual that I thought would come up in the exam.

I asked a lot of questions to others about scores with EET. Here are mine: The first month I was using EET, I averaged 59%; the second month, 66%; the third month, 72%; and the fourth month, 79%. That average was for all the questions I did for the course plus those from the other books I used during that time. I also kept track of the scores for quizzes only. The first round of all quizzes, I averaged 57%; the second round, 70%; the third round, 77%; and the last round, 86%.

I also did the most recent (updated) NCEES exam the Saturday before my exam, simulating the real exam situation. I got 85% on that.

I studied (from May to exam day) for a total of 319.5 hours. Including the hours I studied from February to May, the total is 352 hours. I did a total of 2,700 problems, and many of those were repeated from the materials I had.

The day before the exam, I just reviewed my notes for 30 minutes, packed my bag for the exam, and relaxed. At this point, I knew I was ready, and as nervous and anxious as I was, I tried to stay calm and positive.

On exam day, I took the whole time for the exam. I calculated things even three times to avoid any errors. I had 45 questions in the morning and 35 in the afternoon. During the morning section, I had about five questions I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure about but had answers for. I took the break, got some coffee, and ate something light. When I came back to the test, I found the second part a bit trickier, as there were more conceptual questions with multiple possible solutions. I did not feel as confident about that section and ended up with about eight flagged questions where I was 50/50 between two options.

Thank God I found out I passed, and all the hours spent on this paid off. The hardest part is staying focused for a long time to study and for the eight hours during the exam. I asked the question, ""How does the exam compare to the EET practice exams or NCEES exam?"" A lot, and now my answer would be: it depends on the question. There are definitely some questions that compare to EET‚Äôs ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù questions, and some questions were so easy that I was scared I was missing something. So, I would say, prepare for those harder questions. That way, if they do come up in the exam, you know how to tackle them.

My key takeaway from this whole experience would be: have faith and study hard. If I can do it, you can too, no doubt! It takes a lot of energy and sacrifices, but it is so worth it!",7,1727957220.0,PE_Exam,0,1.0,False

1fv63i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fv63i2/concerned_people_think_im_mad/,Concerned people think I'm mad,"I'm (45m, Uk) have a male partner of 3 years, who lives in a nearby town, I've been successful work wise, have friends and generally life is good.

A few years ago when single I met a guy who I went on a couple of dates with. On the second date two of my friends met him. I felt a bit ill so I came home while the date guy stayed on with them in the pub (I suggested this).

It turns out one friend went home and the other ended up basically doing stuff with my date in the pub toilet (grim I know). 

When I found out I blew up at my friend for doing this as thought it was very disrespectful. In terms of the date I wasn't too sure of him anyway so I just blocked him, no big loss.

I was living with the said friend at the time as housemates. The argument ended up with him outside my bedroom door drunk and one of the things struck a cord with me. He shouted ""you're fucking mad, everyone thinks so"".

I grew up with a mother who had schizophrenia and was often sectioned for a long time. Me and my brothers would visit her after school. My father while not diagnosed with anything was a bit odd too (had no friends, later in his life he started being convinced the neighbours were listening to him through the wall). He was checked out by a doctor for paranoia but was deemed ok which was surprising. They've both now passed.

The you're mad comment played on my mind and did end up asking a different friend about it. She said no you're not mad but you're certainly different to my other friends.

Fast forward a few years later my partner and I were at a wedding. Towards the end of the evening another friend came up to me heavily drunk and said to me along the lines of ""Babe do we need to go for a coffee?"" I said what for and she ""you seem crazed and mad"". 

The mad comment again. This friend was totally unrelated to the other friend so wouldn't have known about his comment. 

I asked my partner and my friends I was sitting with at the wedding and they said no you're fine. 

I messaged her the next morning and she apologised and said she didn't remember saying anything and doesn't think I'm mad.

So now I've got a constant worry that people think I'm mad but not mentioning it. I'm not on any antidepressants, regularly exercise, eat healthy etc. 

Two separate incidents of this by two unconnected people doesn't seem like it can be by chance can it?

Not sure what I can do about this. I've done a few tests online for autism, ADHD etc but they all come back negative. My brother's are fine. I don't have any symptoms that I can think of other than I can be a big obsessive about stuff but any test for OCD comes back negative. I'm generally sociable, humorous, have friends  etc and didn't have problems while going on dates which I think I would if they thought I looked mad. Often got requests for a second date. 

So now I am basically living with the worry I'm mad / look mad.",2,1727957161.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/g1v86ae1zisd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94c692715ed60650a07d20dd884abdfb0b559a96

Freelancing offers the enticing allure of freedom and flexibility, particularly for individuals with families. However, juggling client deadlines, school runs, and Zoom calls while simultaneously managing diaper changes can be a daunting task, akin to a high-wire act without a safety net. How can you successfully navigate this challenging yet rewarding journey as both a freelancer and an engaged parent or caregiver?

This article explores the realities of freelancing while balancing family responsibilities, providing practical strategies to help you thrive in both domains. We will delve into setting boundaries, time management techniques, and ways to achieve harmony between your professional and personal life. Because, let's face it, we all aspire to that elusive work-life balance, even if it sometimes seems as mythical as a unicorn.

# Time Management: The Freelancer's Secret Weapon

If there's one skill that every freelancer with a family needs to master, it's time management. Think of your time as a precious commodity, something to be invested wisely. This means prioritizing tasks, setting realistic deadlines, and learning to say ""no"" when your plate is already full.

* **Prioritize ruthlessly:** Not all tasks are created equal. Learn to identify the most important ones and focus your energy there. Use tools like Eisenhower's Urgent/Important matrix to help you decide what needs your immediate attention and what can be delegated or deferred.  
* **Embrace the power of scheduling:** A well-structured schedule is your best friend. Block out specific times for work, family activities, and (crucially!) personal time. Treat these appointments as sacred and stick to them as much as possible.
* **Break it down:** Large projects can feel overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This not only makes them less daunting but also gives you a sense of accomplishment as you tick off each item.

# Setting Boundaries: Protecting Your Time and Sanity

One of the biggest challenges of freelancing from home is the blurring of lines between work and family life. It's all too easy to get sucked into answering emails during dinner or taking client calls while your child is trying to show you their latest Lego creation.

* **Create a dedicated workspace:** Even if you don't have a separate room, designate a specific area in your home for work. This helps to mentally separate your professional and personal life.
* **Establish clear working hours:** Communicate your availability to clients and stick to it as much as possible. Let your family know when you're ""on the clock"" and shouldn't be disturbed except for emergencies.  
* **Unplug when you're off duty:** Resist the urge to check emails or work on projects during family time. Give your loved ones your undivided attention and recharge your batteries for the next workday.

# Communication is Key

Open and honest communication is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Talk to your clients about your family commitments and explain that there may be times when you're not immediately available. Most clients will be understanding, especially if you're upfront and deliver quality work.

Equally important is communicating with your family. Explain to your partner and children why you need dedicated work time and how they can support you. Involve them in creating your schedule so they feel heard and respected.

# The Power of Flexibility

One of the greatest benefits of freelancing is the flexibility it offers. Take advantage of this to create a schedule that works for you and your family. Perhaps you can work early mornings or late evenings when the kids are asleep. Or maybe you can block out a few hours in the middle of the day for family activities and make up the time later.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Experiment with different schedules and routines until you find what works best for your unique situation.

# Self-Care: Don't Forget the Oxygen Mask

It's easy to get so caught up in the demands of freelancing and family life that you neglect your own needs. But remember, you can't pour from an empty cup. Make time for self-care, whether it's a relaxing bath, a workout, or simply some quiet time to yourself.

When you prioritize your own well-being, you'll be better equipped to handle the challenges of both work and family.

# Finding Your Tribe

Connecting with other freelancers who are also parents or caregivers can be a lifeline. Sharing experiences, advice, and encouragement can make a world of difference. Join online communities, attend local meetups, or simply reach out to other freelancers in your network. Knowing you're not alone in this journey can be incredibly empowering.

# Embrace the Imperfect

Let's be real, there will be days when everything feels like it's falling apart. You'll miss deadlines, your kids will have meltdowns, and you'll probably spill coffee on your keyboard at some point. It's all part of the adventure.

Don't beat yourself up about the occasional misstep. Focus on the big picture and remember why you chose this path in the first place. The freedom, flexibility, and ability to spend more time with your loved ones are priceless.

# The Juggling Act Continues

Balancing freelancing and family life is an ongoing process, not a destination. There will be ups and downs, successes and setbacks. But by prioritizing time management, setting boundaries, communicating effectively, and practicing self-care, you can create a fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle that works for you and your family.

Remember, you're not just a freelancer, and you're not just a parent or caregiver. You're a multifaceted individual with unique talents and aspirations. Embrace the juggling act, celebrate your accomplishments, and remember to enjoy the ride.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

**background**

we broke up after 7 years, just 2 months before our 8th anniversary We had a bad 12 months due to many external stressors. But we had years of good memories. We met in college, and went through many milestones together over the years but I took her for granted. I wanted a good life and to buy our first home. So I worked a lot. Which meant i neglected the relationship. Turned to alcohol to deal with burnout 

**April**

I contact her. And she said she doesn't want to make things work. It's done. I've hurt her and it's not something she wants. she is angry and doesn‚Äôt even want engage is polite small talk. She said stop making me hurt you. It's making me feel awful to keep saying we are finished as I know it hurts you. Please only contact me about final bills 

I don't hear from her other than her sending final bills. Taking me off Netflix etc 

2 weeks later she contacts me asking what would change in the relationship. We talk a while about the issues then the next day she says she doesn't want to get back together. It‚Äôs not something she once.

**May**

Middle of May. She calls me middle of the night. She is upset and crying. She says she is finding life hard without me. She was scared of losing me. We meet the next day for coffee, things go well. We talk about the issues and find solutions. Rest of May I got into a motorbike accident so I was unable to leave my apartment. She called me every 1-2 days. Just to check how I was doing

**June**

She asks me come stay at her place. I agree. We both have time off work and we go on amazing dates. We both have a fun time but back at her place she seems closed off. I know she is hurt but it stopped us from making in progress. We did kiss however but it just wasn't working as I think we both were afraid of getting hurt. When I was leaving she asked is this goodbye forever. can we make this work. My last day here she buys me medicine (have to take some painkillers etc since the accident). She blew a kiss as drove past her apartment 

I call her a few days later. She says she doesn‚Äôt see a future. She hangs up the phone. A week later she text me to see if I am okay.

she texts a few days later saying she can‚Äôt walk away.

**July**

She calls to say she misses me. She can't let me go but is very confused. She says she loves me but is hurt and angry at me. She can't trust me. I tell her how much she means to me. And tell her the changes I‚Äôve made in my life (new job, losing weight, stop drinking, new apartment). She seemed interested and asked many questions. However she said she is angry at me. She said she needs time to heal

I call her few days later. But she completely flips. She says she doesn't want anything to do with me. You hurt me and I can't come back. I started crying and getting upset. She then said stop this or I will block you.

I later text her, just saying sorry. She doesn't reply back. I think when she sees me upset it makes her feel guilty or sad/angry

**what is going on?**

- Why is she so confused? I have said I can solve the issues. I have a new job which means less hours to work
- why has she gone full circle. Back to the start again?

1fv5ys9,https://www.reddit.com/r/arahistoryuntold/comments/1fv5ys9/first_game_finished_a_few_comments/,First Game finished: A few comments,"I just finished my first complete game of Ara:History Untold playing as Catherine the great of Russia on Grand Duke, a large World Spine Map and 36 Nations.  
  
Early game was a lot of fun, but the AI did a few weird moves (like settling in the middle of my at the time 3 cities)  
For most of that I was in the middle of the pack in terms of prestige, for some reason there were about 8 AIs that had more than double the prestige of everyone else.  
That difference would erode over the duration of the first Act and I took the lead around the end of it.  
The AI was keeping up pretty well in general until I unlocked libraries, schools & universities.  
Once those were built the AI couldnt keep up anymore, which made the rest of the game pretty boring.  
I triggered Act 3 by advancing to the Information Age while most AIs were still in High Medieval with the most advanced having just reached Enlightenment.  
That was also the point where I decided to just rush to the end of the game without microing anymore so I built 2 more triumphs to get the prestige for the 25 turn countdown, then just put all of my cities on research and hit end turn 25 times. (annoyingly I had to reselect Tech Singularity every time it finished despite it being the only option)

In the end I think theres still more to fix for the game than just the ui.  
Having played almost to the end still paying attention to the micro made me realize that the scaling in terms of resource production just breaks down in the later game.  
Since all productions just use 1 resource per turn to boost independent of how much actually gets made, the resourceproduction becomes kind of obsolete at the end (a single cotton farm in athenai was enough to fulfill all my cotton needs and that is with using it for trade goods in 8 bazaars meaning -40 per turn from just that)  
For most resources even the base production without the fitting improvement would be enough.  
Also since the city production scales the crafting/harvesting production resources arent even needed for some things (e.g. coffee without coffee beans, which shouldnt even be possible at all)  
At least this way it doesnt matter that the industrial versions of the harvesting improvements (Mine and Farm mostly) seem kinda useless since they barely increase the output (Mine went from producing 42 materials to 45 and I cant use industrial tools/power/fuel to boost it further since it can only use the same supply as before)

A few more things to note:  
- Fishing nets cant be upgraded for some reason, I needed to delete them and newly build Industrial Fishing Farms  
- Cities above I think 27 are capped on health and Security for some reason, I had 3 cities at 30 and 1 at 29 and none of them could get above 45 in those stats (rest would go to waste)  
- Scouts are very annoying in war, almost impossible to catch and block production on the region they are standing on",1,1727956738.0,arahistoryuntold,0,1.0,False

1fv5x54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coupon_/comments/1fv5x54/hostinger_vs_bluehost_2024_comparison/,Hostinger Vs. Bluehost (2024 Comparison) ,"When it comes to choosing between Hostinger and Bluehost, the real experience of using both these hosting providers brings out some interesting contrasts. They‚Äôre both popular, but they cater to slightly different audiences, making each one shine in specific areas. Let‚Äôs dig into what makes each provider tick, drawing from real-life usage.

***Note: Bluehost and Hostinger 75% - 95% coupon code is available in sidebar***

**User Interface and Ease of Use**

One of the first things you'll notice about both Hostinger and Bluehost is how user-friendly they are, but in slightly different ways. Hostinger‚Äôs interface feels streamlined. If you're someone who appreciates clean, modern design, you'll enjoy their dashboard, which isn‚Äôt cPanel but a custom version called hPanel. It‚Äôs easy to navigate, and the learning curve is practically non-existent. When I first used Hostinger, everything felt incredibly intuitive‚Äîthere was no fumbling around, wondering where to go next.

Bluehost, on the other hand, sticks with the more traditional cPanel setup. While it might look a bit dated compared to Hostinger‚Äôs hPanel, it‚Äôs what most people are familiar with, especially if they've used other web hosts before. Bluehost‚Äôs cPanel is feature-rich, and if you‚Äôre an experienced user, the familiarity is comforting. When I worked with Bluehost, I found it reliable, but there were times when the interface felt slightly cluttered. It's functional, but not quite as sleek as Hostinger.

**Performance and Uptime**

Let's talk about speed. Hostinger has earned its stripes with a strong focus on performance. They use LiteSpeed web servers, which genuinely make a difference in page loading times. When I tested a site on Hostinger, it was noticeably snappy, even during peak hours. Hostinger claims uptime of 99.9%, and in my experience, that figure was pretty close. The downtime was minimal over the course of several months‚Äîpractically unnoticeable.

Bluehost, by comparison, offers decent performance, but it didn‚Äôt quite hit the same level of speed as Hostinger. With Bluehost, I noticed occasional slowdowns, especially when the site started receiving more traffic. Bluehost uses Apache servers, which are good, but not as fast as LiteSpeed. While they also promise 99.9% uptime, in real-world testing, I had a couple of noticeable downtimes. Not major outages, but just enough to notice. For a small blog or personal website, this wouldn‚Äôt be a deal-breaker, but for anything more critical, it‚Äôs something to keep in mind.

**Customer Support Experience**

Now, customer support is an area where these two hosts diverge noticeably. Hostinger‚Äôs support is primarily chat-based, and during my experience, it was incredibly responsive. I often got a reply within a minute or two, and the support agents were genuinely helpful. They also didn‚Äôt just provide quick fixes‚Äîthey explained what the issue was and how to prevent it in the future, which is invaluable for those looking to learn.

Bluehost, on the other hand, offers support through phone and chat, which is a nice option if you prefer speaking to someone. However, my interactions with Bluehost support were mixed. Sometimes, the agents were knowledgeable and quick to assist. Other times, I found myself waiting longer and getting generic responses that didn‚Äôt quite address my issues. It‚Äôs not that Bluehost‚Äôs support is bad‚Äîit just felt more hit-or-miss compared to Hostinger's consistently helpful service.

**Pricing and Value for Money**

When it comes to pricing, Hostinger is the clear winner if you‚Äôre budget-conscious. Their plans start at a fraction of the cost compared to Bluehost, and they often have promotional rates that are tough to beat. In my case, I opted for a basic shared hosting plan with Hostinger for a small project, and it cost me less than a cup of coffee each month. Despite the low price, I never felt like I was compromising on quality. They include plenty of features, like free SSL, a domain (in some plans), and easy scalability options.

Bluehost‚Äôs pricing starts higher, and while they offer a free domain for the first year, the renewal rates can catch you off guard. The initial low cost can be appealing, but once that introductory period is over, you‚Äôre looking at a fairly significant price jump. From a real experience standpoint, Bluehost‚Äôs value comes more from the extras they provide‚Äîlike integration with WordPress and bundled marketing credits‚Äîrather than just the raw hosting price.

**WordPress Integration**

Speaking of WordPress, Bluehost is officially recommended by WordPress.org, and it shows in their seamless integration. Setting up WordPress on Bluehost was about as easy as it gets‚Äîjust a couple of clicks, and I was off to the races. Bluehost also provides a suite of tools specifically designed for WordPress users, which can be very helpful if you're looking to launch a WordPress site quickly and without fuss.

Hostinger, too, makes WordPress setup straightforward, and they‚Äôve optimized their environment for WordPress performance with caching plugins and tools like LiteSpeed. However, Bluehost‚Äôs WordPress-specific features‚Äîlike staging environments and in-depth guides‚Äîgave it a slight edge in my book for a WordPress-based site. If you‚Äôre planning a simple blog, Hostinger will do just fine, but for more in-depth WordPress projects, Bluehost might be a better choice.

**Scalability and Hosting Options**

One major benefit of Bluehost is its scalability. As my website grew, I found it easy to move to a higher-tier plan. Bluehost has VPS and dedicated hosting options, which are perfect for scaling up. The transition was smooth, and everything was managed in one place, which simplified things for me.

Hostinger, while also offering scalability options, seems more focused on smaller to medium-sized projects. They do have cloud hosting and VPS plans, and in my experience, upgrading was easy enough, but the feeling was that they‚Äôre most comfortable in the budget hosting space. If you plan to build a massive e-commerce site or something similarly resource-intensive, Bluehost might provide a better long-term path.

**Overall Verdict: Which One to Choose?**

Choosing between Hostinger and Bluehost boils down to what you prioritize most in your hosting experience. Hostinger shines in terms of affordability, performance, and consistent customer support. For anyone looking to start a small to medium-sized website and keep costs low without sacrificing speed or ease of use, Hostinger is a fantastic choice. My personal experience with them has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly for smaller projects where every dollar counts.

Bluehost, while slightly more expensive, offers more comprehensive support for WordPress users and provides easier scalability for larger projects. If you‚Äôre building a WordPress website and want a host that‚Äôs designed specifically for it, Bluehost‚Äôs added features make a compelling case. However, be prepared for the price hike after the initial period, and expect some variability in support experiences.

In short, both hosts have their strengths‚ÄîHostinger for cost-effective performance, and Bluehost for WordPress-centric growth. It ultimately depends on where you see your website today and in the future.",1,1727956576.0,Coupon_,0,1.0,False

1fv5sbh,https://i.redd.it/buuda84q4jsd1.jpeg,Semi-water Fasting until my birthday [48 days] for the second time. VERY IMPORTANT TIPS FOR NEWBIES!,"Guys water fasting is not recommended for most people. Please take these tips from someone who does this regularly now [being broke made me an expert on this lol]

I said semi water fast because I do drink black coffee and chew non-sugar gum [water gum / mastik gum] I have tried to add more things to my fast to see if they make any difference and I found some things that I can drink without breaking my fast. But these things are very specific.

Try different water brands. You have no idea how sensitive your body becomes to taste until you do water fasting and you can ""taste"" the minerals in the water from one brand to another. Try not to drink tap water [depending on where you live] as you will need the minerals 

This is my second time going for a 40+ days fast I wanted to do this last month but I broke my fast because of a wedding party. 

When you break your fast you instantly gain 2 kilos or even more. Don't let that demoralise you as that is just the ""water weight"" that your body stores naturally. You can lose this water weight by just fasting for a day. With the same mindset also do not get too excited that you lost 2 kilos the first day of water fast. Because like mentioned this is just water weight. You have to continue doing this for at least one week to have any results. 

Once you do these fasts regularly you know exactly when your body goes out of ketosis without really needing to do any math. 

The third day is the worst so if you are going through this. Remember the third day you will feel a great sense of depression and will have a very bad mood. So keep it up. 

If you feel any pain on your fourth day like an extreme muscle pain on somewhere on your body [especially if you have an injury] DO NOT START EATING!  this your body healing. This might be the best reason to go on a water diet. It's almost magical for any gym injury. After your body stops taking fats it will instead try to ""eat itself"" so it will produce lots of microphones and ketones and other lovely things that will basically heal your body and detox it. This works much better than any medication. It can even help with people going through cancer treatment and have regular strokes. 

If the pain is too much just use electrolytes.

You can exercise after you feel stable, its fine. Though know that you are not going to gain much muscle on a water diet. But you will ""tone"" your body. You will be ""skinny toned"" not buff. You will only see the muscles under your fat become more obvious but you won't gain much. You can't have gain without protein. If you are worried about your muscle gains. Then just drink protein shakes without any additives. You will break your fast this way. But at least you will still lose about 0.2-0.3 kilo. Which is still way too much. But never do this until you hit the benches. Otherwise you're going to spend your whole day in the bathroom. 

On your first days of waterfasting your bathroom will become your best friend. You are going to spend a lot of time there as your body detox itself from all the toxics and sugar (takes about 7 days) so don't worry about it. You will feel much better after you remove everything.

So the path of preserving our technical paradigm into October OPEX is indeed in full swing now thanks to some graceless nudging by those with the ability to nudge. We'll see today if we can expect some continued downside price movement today and if some recovery can be expected into Friday's price action. Let's see!

**Price Movement Recap**

Yesterday's price action was pretty boring for the most part. Sentimentally, traders were content to play the stock around the Volume Weighted Average Price around $22 for most of the day on notably low overall volume compared to earlier trading. In general, the market was largely neutral on $22 as a valuation and did not organically take to the potential for downside volatility set up by the previous day's targeted short volume to push the price under $22. So, with about an hour left before the close, someone decided to produce through manipulation what traders were not interested in realizing organically.

[10\/2 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/qtzzevb8tisd1.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7e2f3606a634e47e367f45e8344cf5703749dc1)

About 200,000 shares were sold in a single minute - likely short for a collected premium of about $4mil - shoving the price down to $21.44. Attendant options traders picked up on this and open bearish positions in short calls especially to ride the dip and its accompanying IV crush on Calls. 

So why in these cases of price reversal am I saying 'manipulation?' In this case, it is the classic phenomenon of high instantaneous sell volume popping up on the chart with no record in the options data, dark pool feeds, or retail whale feeds - and of course no news. When this type of dip occurs organically, we can see it anticipated in the aforementioned three data sources. As far as I am aware, it is also a conscious choice on the part of the short seller to run a trade of this size through the lit market, as institutions with the ability to short sell 200,000 shares on the lit market likely also have the ability to route the order through a dark pool such as not to disturb the price. *Preventing price disruption from large orders is exactly why dark pools exist and are permitted in the first place*.

Leading into Tuesday's trading, GME's options data was unbelievably bullish - the most we've seen since early May. Trader sentiment - and MM gamma exposure - was highly in favor of a continued push higher. This is to say that the market was demanding more and more future sales of the stock so much so that it drove the price higher and higher. Simple supply and demand. 

However, during Tuesday's trading, the price dropped precipitously on disproportionately lower volume. In fact, it was not driven by options market sentiment or an aberration in sale volume (supply) on the part of average participants, but rather as a reaction to short volume which specifically emerged to counteract organic demand on the part of the market. Yesterday's trading was no different, as can be seen above. There was no organic desire to sell GME, so sales were forced by someone who did not have shares of the company to sell in the first place. 

Once again, this was likely a move by institutional participants to guarantee the profitability of their short options positions and guarantee conformity to our technical paradigm. 

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Max Pain for this week is still at $21.50 with the 10/18 OPEX Max Pain sitting down at $20. Farther OTM Puts and Calls were taken off the board in some sizable numbers yesterday likely by short options traders satisfied with their gains off of yesterday's late dip. Some new OI was built out just above and below our current price point:

[10\/4 OI Changes 10\/2-10\/3](https://preview.redd.it/qwqinttixisd1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=4472484cae8147db483f30c01a8a79ce71519739)

October OPEX new OI was pretty light, except for an uncharacteristically large expansion in Put OI at $18:

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/2-10\/3](https://preview.redd.it/j8m0h8tmxisd1.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&s=b284c7810e2fa15ff9e8b0b0f234221127fbfcc8)

This looks to have been built out by a single trader, perhaps someone looking to take advantage of today's potential quick volatility down through $21. 

[Lol, good luck dude!](https://preview.redd.it/8229pc1d1jsd1.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=d77656ec211f29de9bc7fb4165d28e2ca6c23fd2)

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/s9dg4i9jyisd1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=99bd4ae4516db5706489cf25d8898fb000c0053a

Our MM Gamma Exposure table continues to display confirmation of my projection that our current bearish reversal tap out of momentum between $20.50 and $21. With our current price in premarket sitting between $21.50 and $21 traders may finally accept the will of the market's institutional overlords and ride the price into that lone net-negative gamma zone at $21, where downside volatility will realize quickly into the cushy, composite, large total gamma position at $20.50-$20. A breach of this area is highly unlikely this week, barring some major bearish informational externality coming across the newsfeed.

Given the amount of call gamma on the board this week, if such downside volatility can materialize today, it may set up yet another Friday small gamma ramp opportunity if the right players are interested in such a move and have the capital set aside to make it happen.

With the exception of the blip in Put OI opened at $18, 10/18 OPEX gamma structure in the lower $20s is stable and absent our $21 negative gamma pocket, though there is notably still an OI 'deadzone' at $22.50:

**Technicals**

So, another day, another candle conforming to the doodle projection transposed up by $1. Hopefully this means that my earlier projection this week that our retrace scenario only runs down to somewhere in the $20.50-$21 is also correct, seeing that the big boys are such technical sticklers on this puppy from the looks of it. All the same, our technical paradigm continues to narrow with the 50-day SMA sitting at $22 and the 200-day now at $19.07. By October OPEX, the difference between these two lines will be about $1.60 at our current trending rate of convergence. By October 31, at that same rate, they will touch.  


**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/hgfppz09qisd1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=beec837779191e566cc7924c4f54b8dc15d93a99

Nothing groundbreaking here, but as GME's price retraces to the downside, options volume has a tendency to drop with it as call-buying dries up in the expectation of continued downside volatility. For Dealers and traders selling volatility, this is the goal. With our volatility pump last Friday and Monday, many contracts on both sides of the chain pumped in value from IV appreciation. By snuffing out the bullish sentiment with targeted short volume OTM contracts - especially calls - decrease in value precipitously since they lack intrinsic value with respect to the underlying. 

**Synthesis¬†+ TA;DR**

Today it looks like a quick run down through the high net negative gamma exposure position at $21 is likely. However, it is unlikely to penetrate below the $20.50-$20 composite high total gamma position beneath it. If it does occur, it will likely happen quickly and may have the effect of setting up a short gamma ramp on Friday where the price returns to the area around Max Pain at $21.50 for and EOW close around $22. Whether this develops as I have laid it out in potential is for us to observe throughout the trading day today.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

I decided to go on a diet with my wife that‚Äôs Huel, coffee, produce, and seasonings. With business trips allowing a rare fast food visit. This is to help wife lose weight, as she just can‚Äôt fight regular food cravings no matter what. And I can‚Äôt fight buying the snack carbs that tempt her. Ozempic, etc are not an option. 

Here‚Äôs September:

-We thought we would get through all the non-Huel food, but still have some.

-We weren‚Äôt going to add in faux meats, but caught a sale. Oddly enough, we had 12 days to consume and avoided it due to laziness facilitated by Huel.

-I am STILL not tired of Huel mac. I noticed myself craving this one specifically.

-Mixing 50/50 Huel essential (not sure what flavor) and Black cookies in cream is disgusting. Do not do that.

-I wasn‚Äôt supposed to partake in the ‚Äúregular food‚Äù that can appear for work birthdays. But I did. And it made me crave regular food again. I am hoping to ignore the food in the future, minus some free fruit and veg. So I ended up with about 3 Burger King and 3 Taco Bell visits this month.

-Hurricane Helene had us without power long enough to lose our refrigerated food, so I am replacing the three sad cheese bags we had, for wife‚Äôs sake. We also did end up with a Papa John‚Äôs pizza when our power was out. I just really didn‚Äôt want Huel Black after a work day. I wanted something warm.

-I fell prey to Soylent‚Äôs new Pumpkin Spice RTD. Got a case of 12 on discount, but now they‚Äôre too expensive at full price. This got me back into checking Amazon for them, so long as they are cheaper than Huel savory. I just ordered a 12 case of chocolate today on sale.

-I did do a post on the GNC products, I hate the bars and black RTD. I will still try new bar flavors as they appear, if that sample option appears on the website. I have avoided trying regular RTD due to price.

-Sugar cravings from some work cupcakes meant I had to drink some sugar free drinks a while to make the cravings go away. Snapple Zero Sugar Iced Tea with Lemon is so good. But this is a ‚Äúsugar craving removal‚Äù technique only.

-I discovered a local business that does mini vegan cheesecakes that don‚Äôt trigger cravings. I think we may keep these as a rare treat. Support local and all that. Hazelnut chocolate cheesecake is my weakness I didn't know I had.

-50g prepped mac and cheese with garlic powder, Aldi hot sauce, and MSG with half a can of Siete Ranchero beans tastes like the good kind of shitty Taco Bell at home. Glad I had that can left over.

-Someone mentioned using energy drinks less with more Huel. I have noticed that is true for me. I use less. But I also have had fatigue issues undiagnosed for years now that may be illness related, so the energy drinks will still appear 50% of the time. Saves me money on those, though!


Lesson Learned: I am fine with the real Huel diet if I avoid ‚Äúregular‚Äù food at work. Especially sweets. I also may be 80% Huel diet instead of 100%.

**background**

we broke up after 7 years, just 2 months before our 8th anniversary We had a bad 12 months due to many external stressors. But we had years of good memories. We met in college, and went through many milestones together over the years but I took her for granted. I wanted a good life and to buy our first home. So I worked a lot. Which meant i neglected the relationship. Turned to alcohol to deal with burnout 

**April**

I contact her. And she said she doesn't want to make things work. It's done. I've hurt her and it's not something she wants. she is angry and doesn‚Äôt even want engage is polite small talk. She said stop making me hurt you. It's making me feel awful to keep saying we are finished as I know it hurts you. Please only contact me about final bills 

I don't hear from her other than her sending final bills. Taking me off Netflix etc 

2 weeks later she contacts me asking what would change in the relationship. We talk a while about the issues then the next day she says she doesn't want to get back together. It‚Äôs not something she once.

**May**

Middle of May. She calls me middle of the night. She is upset and crying. She says she is finding life hard without me. She was scared of losing me. We meet the next day for coffee, things go well. We talk about the issues and find solutions. Rest of May I got into a motorbike accident so I was unable to leave my apartment. She called me every 1-2 days. Just to check how I was doing

**June**

She asks me come stay at her place. I agree. We both have time off work and we go on amazing dates. We both have a fun time but back at her place she seems closed off. I know she is hurt but it stopped us from making in progress. We did kiss however but it just wasn't working as I think we both were afraid of getting hurt. When I was leaving she asked is this goodbye forever. can we make this work. My last day here she buys me medicine (have to take some painkillers etc since the accident). She blew a kiss as drove past her apartment 

I call her a few days later. She says she doesn‚Äôt see a future. She hangs up the phone. A week later she text me to see if I am okay.

she texts a few days later saying she can‚Äôt walk away.

**July**

She calls to say she misses me. She can't let me go but is very confused. She says she loves me but is hurt and angry at me. She can't trust me. I tell her how much she means to me. And tell her the changes I‚Äôve made in my life (new job, losing weight, stop drinking, new apartment). She seemed interested and asked many questions. However she said she is angry at me. She said she needs time to heal

I call her few days later. But she completely flips. She says she doesn't want anything to do with me. You hurt me and I can't come back. I started crying and getting upset. She then said stop this or I will block you.

I later text her, just saying sorry. She doesn't reply back. I think when she sees me upset it makes her feel guilty or sad/angry

**what is going on?**

- Why is she so confused? I have said I can solve the issues. I have a new job which means less hours to work
- why has she gone full circle. Back to the start again? 
- she seemed to have flipped in a space of a week 

**what I want**

[Why Kamala Harris says we need a national reserve for critical minerals \[Video\] (aol.com)](https://www.aol.com/finance/why-kamala-harris-says-national-080016936.html)

Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt just want to build more factories in the US if elected President. She also wants to help secure steady supplies of materials to fuel them.

A recent promise that embodies this approach is her proposed establishment of a ""national reserve"" of¬†[critical minerals](https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals)¬†such as cobalt, lithium, and nickel ‚Äî the crucial building blocks in everything from EV batteries to jet engines to medical devices.

Such a new reserve could join existing government reserves like the[¬†Department of Energy's strategic petroleum reserve](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-challenging-effort-to-refill-americas-energy-backstop-140100148.html)¬†and put a Harris administration in competition with Chinese businesses that have long dominated the work of mining and refining these metals.

This idea floated last week in a paper from the Harris campaign is part of a larger re-industrialization strategy from the Democratic nominee that both embraces a Joe Biden-led effort to reimagine the US government's relationship with manufacturers while also differing from the President‚Äôs approach in terms of tactics, incentives and focus.

She described her overall vision in a recent speech of one that would ""recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century.""

This shift, according to some Democratic policymakers, is necessary after the Biden years saw a surge in new factory construction but lingering worries about supply chains to feed them.

""I kind of liken our re-embrace of industrial policy as a three-act play,"" said Jennifer Harris, a top figure who helped lead industrial policy in the early years of the Biden administration.

She is hopeful a Harris presidency could usher in that new chapter, especially around these minerals. ""A lot of AI technology build out is going to involve a lot more rocks coming out of the ground,"" she said.

It's a vision that could of course take a radically different turn if Donald Trump prevails in November.

The GOP nominee[¬†laid out his own plan for manufacturing recently](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trumps-trade-protectionism-keeps-intensifying-184713836.html)¬†focused on a very different approach of ratcheting up tariffs and then limiting government involvement in the sector itself with lower taxes and less regulations.

Trump has also been dismissive of Biden efforts to bring back areas like semiconductors.

""Chips, we're really starting to go \[down\] with the chips,"" Trump said during a recent speech, completely overlooking the roughly $280 billion in new investments in the sector implemented during the Biden administration through the 2022 CHIPs and Science Act.

# Critical minerals and supply chains

President Biden has indisputably reimagined the US government's relationship with manufacturers, with government efforts in recent years sending billions to semiconductor makers, green energy companies, and more to spur new factory building in recent years.

The Harris/Walz white paper released last week touted Biden's effort and signaled an expansion in different areas ‚Äî from biomanufacturing to aerospace to quantum computing and more ‚Äî as well as a section devoted to those critical minerals needed to fuel them.

A Harris/Walz administration would ""build out domestic processing capacity of critical minerals necessary for our economic and national security, including by launching a national reserve for these resources,"" the plan promises.

The Defense Logistics Agency is a wing of the US government that currently gathers and stores some of these metals ‚Äî with Harris signaling a potential expansion of those efforts and a potentially wider focus than simply national security concerns.

It's part, Jennifer Harris added, of a necessary second act for government in industry focused on ""the unsexy work of...fixing a ton of supply-and-demand mismatches at each point of a usually pretty long-falling supply chain that are going to require new policy tools.""

The potential need for a reserve was perhaps put into stark relief this week¬†[when Hurricane Helene disrupt mining operations in North Carolina](https://www.yahoo.com/news/helene-shutters-spruce-pine-nc-004044203.html)¬†for quartz, a primary ingredient in the silicon needed for semiconductor production.

Extensive damage to the area could impact access to the mines and the ability to transport for months, according to reports.

Much of how Harris said she would achieve these goals is via a new wave of tax credits dubbed ""America Forward tax credits."" The credits, the Harris campaign estimates, would cost approximately $100 billion and be paid for by international tax reforms.

# Plenty of strings attached

These tax credits will also be designed, the Harris campaign promised, with significant strings attached.

Much like the Biden administration efforts to link grants for industries like semiconductors with company behavior, everything from unionization, community investments, and prioritizing Made in America products.

On this front, Harris is signaling a continuation of Biden administration practices. One area that got particular focus in the rollout of the CHIPs and Science Act focused on semiconductors was government interest in company practices down to the level of childcare facilities provided.

""And if I had my druthers,"" added Jennifer Harris, ""I would be making sure that there are no share buybacks above a certain level for corporations who are receiving grants or loans from the US government to do some of this rebuilding.""

And in her recent speech: Harris also outlined a significant carrot for manufacturers ‚Äî as well as for the miners of critical minerals: permitting reform to get projects off the ground quicker.

""Projects take too long to go from concept to reality,"" she said in her speech, adding ""I will tell you this. China is not moving slowly and we can't afford to, either.""

[The Jervois cobalt mine in Idaho has been buffeted by the kind of price swings whose impacts the Harris plan seeks to blunt. Natalie Behring for WSJ](https://preview.redd.it/x9iznwrlxisd1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=9816746a67526c3077f496f030baf6b6efeadf36)

Nickel and cobalt aren‚Äôt often topics in U.S. presidential campaigns.

But in laying out her proposed economic policies this past week, Vice President Kamala Harris put a spotlight on those so-called critical minerals and other materials essential to defense technology and electric vehicles.

Harris wants the U.S. to produce and process more of these minerals, which are also used in energy storage and nuclear power, in a bid to counter Chinese-dominated supply chains. She has proposed building a U.S. stockpile for critical minerals, an idea that has floated around Washington in recent months on both sides of the political aisle.

A physical or financial stockpile would expand upon investments by the Trump and Biden administrations to bolster an atrophied U.S. mining sector and build renewable-energy supply chains insulated from Chinese influence. Agencies including the Pentagon have funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into mining companies and funds in recent years, backing drilling projects and buying equity stakes.

Meanwhile, the State Department has been meeting with governments and companies friendly to the U.S., urging them to look at various mining assets around the world.

But Washington‚Äôs efforts abroad are up against longstanding Chinese business ties with many large producers, as well as China‚Äôs massive refining capacity for metals such as copper, lithium and nickel. Western miners complain Beijing floods the market with supplies, contributing to violent price swings that can tank generally more expensive projects in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.

Last year, a federally backed Idaho cobalt mine three decades in the making suspended operations just weeks before it began producing its first pound of the lustrous silvery metal, which is key for munitions and electric-vehicle batteries. The culprit: a price collapse at the wrong moment.

The Harris plan to blunt those impacts offers few details, but industry participants say a stockpile could work a few different ways. A physical stockpile would allow the country to dip into reserves when it needed to, such as in the face of extreme export restrictions by China. Or, in a market where commodity prices have crashed amid oversupply, producers could sell their material to the U.S. at above-market prices.

‚ÄúStockpiles are actually incredibly important, especially because China is showing they‚Äôre willing to weaponize resources in very short supply,‚Äù said Gracelin Baskaran, director for the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She pointed to Chinese export restrictions on graphite, used in electric-vehicle batteries; germanium and gallium, used in semiconductors; and antimony, used in weapons and ammunition.

A stockpiling system in which the government trades financial instruments such as futures contracts would help domestic miners shield themselves from turbulence, said Arnab Datta, a managing director at Employ America, a research group that has pushed for more aggressive use of strategic reserves.

Volatility ‚Äúreally prevents people from investing sufficiently to meet our needs,‚Äù he said.

The push to stockpile key materials stretches back some 85 years, to the eve of World War II, when Congress authorized officials to snap up supplies in the event of a national security crisis. Washington bolstered reserves to buffer against Soviet expansionism in the 1950s, boosting domestic mining of minerals including cobalt.

The government has gradually sold off many of those Cold War-era supplies in recent decades. But the Defense Logistics Agency still stores thousands of tons of materials such as chromium and zinc in six locations across the country, according to its website.

Because the current National Defense Stockpile is limited to the defense sector, a separate critical minerals reserve would likely be broader.

Support for more aggressive intervention in the Chinese-dominated markets has also grown on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill proposing a $750 million pilot program at the Energy Department to explore futures contracts and other financial products to shield domestic companies from price shocks.

Meanwhile, representatives on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party are planning to advance their own bipartisan legislation later this year that will call for a national reserve, according to a committee aide. The committee in December called for tax incentives for manufacturing in the U.S. things such as magnets with rare-earth elements.

To be sure, a national stockpile wouldn‚Äôt be a panacea. The U.S. is late in devising a national-security framework predicated on securing critical minerals. Some believe that to truly protect the economy and national security, the country has to undertake more domestic mining, which has been slow to develop due to environmental concerns and permitting timetables. In Harris‚Äôs speech on Wednesday, she mentioned reforms to permitting‚Äîlong a bugbear of the industry, where getting a mine online can take 15 years.

‚ÄúA stockpile could be a fail-safe, but not a solution to the underlying problem of China‚Äôs current control over critical mineral supplies and markets, and our economic vulnerability from lack of supply security or industrial know-how,‚Äù said Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, an organization that advocates for U.S. energy security.

Hunter says she welcomes Harris‚Äôs focus on critical materials and would like to see a clearer path to market for domestic mines and more global initiatives to accelerate investment in this area.

While employing strategic stockpiles as economic tools has long been discussed, the Biden administration was the first to do so on a massive scale.

After Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices skyrocketing, the Energy Department tried to dull the pain by selling an unprecedented 180 million barrels of crude from skyscraper-sized storage caverns in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Since then, the government has partially replenished the stockpiles at lower prices, netting hundreds of millions of dollars in theoretical gains.

[Every mineral demands a unique processing solution, but the most common, commercially-proven techniques fall into three broad categories: physical beneficiation, hydrometallurgy, and pyrometallurgy. Each of these categories encompasses a variety of processing methods, from methods that rely on physical properties like density and magnetism to methods that involve complex chemical reactions and high-temperature treatments.

On August 14th, the People‚Äôs Republic of China announced¬†[restrictions on the export of antimony](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-antimony-export-restrictions-impact-us-national-security#:~:text=China%20announced%20export%20restrictions%20on%20antimony%20in%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20latest%20move%20to%20restrict%20critical%20mineral%20shipments%20globally%20in%20the%20name%20of%20national%20security.)¬†‚Äì a critical mineral with essential military and commercial applications. America is totally reliant on foreign antimony imports,¬†[63 percent](https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-national-defense-stockpile-small-important-and-should-be-bigger#:~:text=fully%2063%20percent%20of%20U.S.%20antimony%20imports)¬†of which come from China. But antimony is just one example of a larger trend in critical minerals. America, with few domestic sources to speak of, is reliant on increasingly complicated and precarious multinational supply chains to procure essential materials.

The threat of losing access to critical materials is not new ‚Äì it compelled Congress to pass the Strategic Critical Materials Stockpiling Act in 1939. The legislation¬†[established the National Defense Stockpile](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833)¬†(NDS), a little-known subsidiary of the Department of Defense. From its inception, the NDS was intended to manage the accumulation of dozens of different materials that would be essential to conduct war. But the modern NDS is insufficiently equipped to meet the challenges of great power competition ‚Äì a 2023 NDS estimate found that the current stockpile would meet¬†[6 percent of essential shortfalls](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833)¬†in a national security crisis. To ensure America‚Äôs access to critical minerals in times of national emergency, policymakers must rebuild the NDS to meet today‚Äôs threats.

To reform the NDS, it is essential to first understand its structure. As part of the Department of Defense,¬†[NDS operations are overseen by the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), who simultaneously serves as the National Defense Stockpile Manager. The NDS is also overseen by the Strategic Critical Minerals Board of Directors, chaired by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy. With twelve other board members, the board of directors provides oversight and outlines strategy. Further down in the chain of command, the day-to-day logistics are overseen by an NDS administrator and deputy, who manage the agency‚Äôs strategic stockpiles.

https://preview.redd.it/rc6kf92l1jsd1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14e29cefc622d60407fd2f9db971b8e62cf1bb2

During the Cold War, the agency oversaw about 102 different stockpile locations ‚Äì today, it oversees six. This decrease has followed a larger sale of stockpiled material since the end of World War II. Today‚Äôs¬†[$912.3 million in stockpile assets](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833)¬†is a¬†[98% reduction of its value since 1952](https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-national-defense-stockpile-small-important-and-should-be-bigger). While our supply chains have become more complicated and increasingly rely on our competitors, America has drawn down on its reserves of the materials that power essential technologies. When the NDS is diminished, so is America‚Äôs ability to adequately respond to national security threats.

If Congress is seriously concerned with meeting the demands of strategic grand power competition, its actions should reflect its rhetoric.¬†[Between 2002 and 2022](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), Congress transferred more than $6 billion in proceeds from the periodic sale of NDS material out of the NDS Transaction Fund and applied them towards the federal General Fund. Congress does not appropriate funds to NDS on an annual basis ‚Äì the agency¬†[¬†is reliant on proceeds from the sale of stockpiled material to pay for operating and maintenance costs.](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/revitalizing-the-national-defense-stockpile-era-great-power-competition)¬†For the last two decades, Congress slowly drained the NDS of its value and utility. This shortsighted removal of funds is not without consequences. American national security is threatened by a decrease in our stockpile levels. And NDS itself is projected to reach a¬†[fiscally dangerous level by next year](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/revitalizing-the-national-defense-stockpile-era-great-power-competition).

As a result of our increasingly vulnerable critical mineral supply chain, as well as Congressional mismanagement, today‚Äôs NDS is unable to meet its mission: supply critical materials for essential civilian and military usage. According to the FY23 stockpile assessment, the NDS has¬† shortfalls of¬†[$14 billion in more than 80 different materials](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), meeting only 37.9 percent of military needs and less than 10 percent of essential civilian needs in the event of a national emergency.

As China‚Äôs recent antimony restrictions show, America‚Äôs ability to build critical technologies is subject to the whims of our competitors. Without antimony,¬†[our military cannot build certain automobile batteries, night vision goggles](https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-national-defense-stockpile-small-important-and-should-be-bigger), or more than¬†[300 different types of munitions](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/china-antimony-exports-restrictions-u-s-national-security-idaho-perpetua-resources-e8b701b8?mod=opinion_lead_pos3). With only a fraction of the critical materials essential to military and civilian technologies, America will not be able to sustain its defense industrial base.

***If we do not want to let China and Russia dictate our access to the minerals that power frontier innovations, policymakers must take steps to rebuild the National Defense Stockpile into what it once was: a bulwark against material shortfalls that provided America security against supply chain disruptions.***

***First, Congress must ensure that the NDS has the funds it needs by making annual appropriations to close the $14 billion shortfall gap by 2027 and prohibit the extraction of material sale proceeds from the National Defense Stockpile Trust Fund. Congress should also revisit NDS‚Äôs shortfall planning scenario.***¬†[Currently, the NDS aims to stockpile enough material to last one year of active combat and three years of recovery](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833)***. By increasing these parameters to three years each, lawmakers may furnish the NDS with more materials than it needs ‚Äì but it is better to be oversupplied than experience shortfalls in the middle of war.***

***On the part of NDS, its board of directors ought to take advantage of their limited oversight and strategic planning capabilities. While they stockpile materials with the intention of using them, the NDS board should increase spending on Defense Logistic Agency‚Äôs Strategic Material grants to research and development projects that seek to find alternatives to reliance on certain critical minerals. It is good to stockpile critical materials, but even better to eliminate that reliance entirely. The NDS board should also increase information sharing with relevant agencies and private sector partners to facilitate collaboration in securing critical minerals and build out domestic capacity for refineries.***

***Antimony is just one part of a larger dynamic that threatens America‚Äôs ability to engage in great power competition. By rebuilding the National Defense Stockpile through normalized appropriations, updated planning scenarios, increased grant spending, and interagency collaboration, America can secure its access to everyday and next-generation technologies.***

There was gestational sac and yolk sac and what looked like a baby but super tiny and no activity. My HCG  was 8283. Antibody screen Negative , Progesterone was 25.7.    CRL was measuring    2.1 mm

Two weeks later i went for another ultrasound and we saw the baby who was a little tiny. And i guess they measure using their own calculations and it showed 6w5d. And we saw the heartbeat measuring 138.

My new hcg was 84852
Progesterone went down to 22.6
CRL was 7.8 cm

Prior to the 2nd ultrasound i was scared that we wouldn't see the heartbeat. My husband was not there for the first Ultrasound. I was scared that he would be heartbroken if we didnt see the heartbeat. Thank god we did she the heartbeat.

Is 138 bpm okay for 6w5d. Also i am scared that baby is behind by a week and few days. My OB told me that as long as the growth was consistent, she wasn't concerned about the baby being small or measuring behind. We told my in-laws about the baby and they are excited since the baby will be the first grandchild. I'm scared and not as attached to the baby incase anything goes wrong. I think my husband would be heartbroken and I'm scared about it.

Also I am not consuming as much protein because eggs make me nauseous. My breasts are sore and i have cramping all the time and nauseous when i drink coffee or brush my teeth.

1fv5fn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coupon_/comments/1fv5fn9/aws_amazon_web_services_vs_bluehost_in_2024/, aws (Amazon Web Services) vs Bluehost in 2024,"Choosing between AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Bluehost can feel like you're deciding whether to walk into a rocket science lab or a cozy, friendly caf√©. Both have their strengths, but the type of experience you're looking for‚Äîand your technical comfort level‚Äîdetermines which option is the better fit. After having explored both, it's clear that if you're new to the online world or don‚Äôt want to deal with a technical headache, Bluehost feels like a gentle breeze compared to the storm of complexity AWS can bring.

***Note: Bluehost 75% - 95% coupon code is available in sidebar***

**AWS: Power, But At What Cost?**

Let‚Äôs talk AWS. This platform is like being handed the keys to a sports car with a complicated manual. It‚Äôs powerful, no doubt. AWS offers countless features, from cloud storage to machine learning, and it‚Äôs used by big corporations for a reason. However, unlocking all that power often requires more than a basic understanding of hosting. You need to know your way around servers, databases, configurations, and networking protocols.

From the start, AWS feels less like a user-friendly interface and more like a series of choices that can overwhelm you if you‚Äôre not used to terms like EC2, RDS, S3, and load balancing. Even their setup process‚Äîwhere you can spin up a server‚Äîis highly customizable, but also technical. Do you know how to set up security groups? Can you configure network layers or tweak the load balancers? If yes, AWS might be your playground. But if you're like most people who simply want to get a website up and running, you‚Äôll quickly find yourself tangled in a web of jargon and decisions that need to be made precisely, or risk downtime.

AWS is perfect for developers or businesses with an in-house tech team ready to handle all that complexity. It‚Äôs scalable, sure, but the road to scalability can feel bumpy unless you have the knowledge to navigate it.

**Bluehost: Simple and Straightforward**

Enter Bluehost, where setting up a website feels more like a friendly chat over coffee. From the get-go, Bluehost gives you a smoother, far less intimidating experience. The setup process takes you by the hand, with clear, simple steps that even someone with zero hosting experience can understand. Want to install WordPress? It‚Äôs done with a click. Need to set up a business email? No problem. Bluehost doesn't bog you down with choices that require an IT degree to understand.

Their dashboard is built with the user in mind‚Äîanyone can navigate it. You won‚Äôt find yourself drowning in a sea of configurations or technical terms. Bluehost is for the user who wants to spend less time worrying about the backend and more time focusing on the front end‚Äîthe actual content, the reason you‚Äôre setting up a website in the first place.

Bluehost also comes with customer support that feels like an actual person is there to guide you. AWS, while it offers support, often requires sifting through a complex ticketing system or paying extra for higher levels of support. With Bluehost, help is just a chat or phone call away, and the reps are prepared to walk you through solutions step by step.

**Technical Knowledge: The Deal Breaker**

Here‚Äôs where the real difference lies: the need for technical knowledge. AWS demands it. From understanding how to optimize server performance to configuring backups and securing data, AWS isn‚Äôt for the faint-hearted. It‚Äôs like driving that aforementioned sports car‚Äîyou can‚Äôt just hit the gas and go; you need to know how to handle the machine.

Bluehost, however, is like hopping into a comfortable sedan with automatic transmission. It‚Äôs reliable, intuitive, and doesn‚Äôt require you to understand the mechanics under the hood. You just drive. Want to set up a blog? Bluehost has a one-click installation for WordPress, making the whole process feel effortless.

**Cost Comparison**

Speaking of effort, there‚Äôs also the cost factor. AWS pricing can fluctuate depending on the services you use, and it‚Äôs easy to accidentally rack up costs if you‚Äôre not careful. Bluehost, on the other hand, offers simple, predictable pricing. You know what you‚Äôre getting into upfront. For beginners or small businesses, this transparency in pricing makes it easier to plan and manage expenses.

**The Bottom Line: Ease of Use Wins**

In the end, if you‚Äôre someone who relishes tinkering and enjoys the deep end of tech waters, AWS might appeal to you. But for most people looking to start a blog, set up a small business site, or run a simple online store, Bluehost makes far more sense. It‚Äôs user-friendly, doesn‚Äôt require advanced tech knowledge, and provides the tools you need without overwhelming you.

Why take the complicated route when a simpler, just-as-effective option exists? With Bluehost, you can get the same results, minus the hassle.",1,1727954862.0,Coupon_,0,1.0,False

Don't hate, hear me out.

I didn't make this post to try to flex or anything like that, I just see a lot of comments and confusion and unreal expectations and I'm just giving my point of view on this coin.

I own Bitcoin as well, I recently went to New York City and was able to purchase a cup of coffee using my Bitcoin. 

So when I buy bitcoin, the purpose of this is to use it just like I do Fiat when I can, I have no plans to sell Bitcoin because of its utility.

When I bought SHIB, there is no use for it other than to buy low and sell High at the moment. 

So if you're buying this coin to hold it forever without knowing what this coin can do I think that would be a mistake at this time. 

I've been buying SHIB since 2021 and I've made a few dollars when it's gone real high and when it goes low I buy back in.

First of all, hello everyone. I'm new here because I just learned about this as a vivid and lucid dreamer, and always been so fascinated abou dreams.
I stumbled on this sub a whiel back and was reading all about it. Last night I think I DID IT. I'm writing this as I just woke up

The trip
For context, I keep a 4-ish inches gap between my bed and the wall, because I dont like to touch the wall at night, it's cold.
Last night I went to bed as usual, and dreamed that I was making lemonade for my mom in her old coffee shop when I was a kid. 
when I started realizing I was dreaming, I immediately attempted to break out of my body, and holy shit, everythinf you guys said was true. I'm getting chills juat thinking about it

I hear my husband snoring next to me, and felt the vibration and I was shot through a tunnel from where I was sleeping. Like when you're about to go thru sleep paralysis. I was scared
Then, I saw myself fell down the gap between my bed and the wall, both hands on the ground, and I reqlly thought I was awake and I have woken up so hard that I fell thru the crack. I saw my husband sleeping as I stood up, and saw a shadow in the corner of the door, but I brushed it off as it was just a towel. But I still think that have woken up already and failed to AP
 So I didn't bother counting my fingers or look at my phone. I kept thinkinG about ehat to do next now that I'm awake. 

....Until i woke up again at 7am, immediately look down to the gap, and realizing that it was TOO NARROW for me to fall down on all fours. It was 4 inches wide, I would have been stuck there had I actually fell down.

I was shocked, because I did really left my body. And I'm 100% believe you guys now. I had my doubts as first, but man it was true..

Do suggest what kind of mindset i should adopt for manifesting money. Should i just be delusional and spent like i normally do? Should I spend like i already have millions or should i just limit myself and not spend on necessities as much??? 

Bckstory:
I (26,F) spend a little too much in a month that my account hve 1k left... so i spend about almost 10k mid September, the month that i told myself to be more mindful of my spending. 

I was doing okay early sept then bammmm!!!!!!

Since then, i became a bit anxious and frugal with my coffee money, lunch and necessities. It feels awful to spend at the same time of course i need to spend some money to live. 

Im not sure if this is self sabotage or a limiting belief. Im not much of a spender but i got a nice paying job this year and somehow i became quite big at spending (buying gifts, treating my fmily, facials). I could finally feel like a girl type of spending. I did took quite a long time to save up 10k and all of it went to spending felt quite a hit... my company isn't doing well and they started to limit some perks and overtime which adds to my anxiousness.

I don't regret my spending since it's treating my siblings on an overseas trip and a nice camera for the trip but i feel like being frugal limits abundance but at the same time buying little things like coffee, lunchh, transport felt a lotttt. 

I'm sure spending 10k a month is like coffee money to some of you but any tips on feeling abundant when you spend a lot more than your comfort zone?

* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.

They knew eachother since 4th grade,since 4th grade.At first ill tbh I felt insecure I mean who wouldn't?They sometimes finish eachother sentences they had those ""sleepovers"" which I know sounds bad but he always brought me with, since we started dating and it wasn't anything intimate, but I always felt kinda third wheeling on my own relationship if that makes sense?. There are many stuff which rubbed me the wrong way but to shorten it, they are just very close and know eachother better than I know him.I kinda swallowed my pride for him since I really love him.
Basically what happened is he brought Valeria with us. And the whole ride they were the ones talking and joking. Most of the stuff they said I didn't even understood and when I asked, she said it's a ""inside joke"" so I dropped it.We stepped inside a Venus.And I was sitting at the time as Val and Elliott were being all enthusiastic and joyful, he didn't even glanced at me once.I felt like it was their venue and what I thought didn't matter. We spend Atleast anhour there with them joking and talking about the marriage how good it will be with some decorations and such. Ik its also my fault that I didnt include myself aswell.But I js didnt felt well. It was everything going on tht upsetme.Even when we came to the venue they looked like they were the ones getting married.Even the person who showed us the venue thought they were a couple and they just laughed it off but didn't corrected her?Js theway they looked at eachother gave me nausea. So I said to Eliott I dont exactly feel well I think Ill go home but he didnt even heard me so I said it again and he just waved me of while talking to his friend. So I just got up and left with the buss.I didn't wanted to go home so I stayed at a coffee shop.I felt and still feel miserable, he didn't even called or texted. So when his sister which I'm good friends w called.I just broke down and told her everything, specifically that I don't think I can continue this, with him. She promised me not to tell him since I want some time to think about it before I do a hasty decision.But she told him anyway. The moment I went home  he was already there, sobbing.I tried to ask him what's wrong and comfort him but he just pushed me not very gently and said,quote ""why do u care? weren't you the one wanting to cancel everything?  Are u trying to humiliate me? speaking about it to my family but not w me what the fuck is wrong with u?."" I didn't wanted to cry Infront of him.So i rushed upstairs to the guest room.

One of those places where the pictures simply cannot do it justice.

It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to capture the absolute grandeur of these trees.

We had two nights camping here, which gave us enough time to knock off the highlights of the park (Giant Forest, Congress Trail, General Sherman, Moro Rock, Tunnel Log, Beetle Rock)

Moro Rock at sunrise was a cool experience as there were only about a half dozen people at the top (although the hike up in the dark was a little sketchy haha)

We hit up Tunnel Log and the Congress Trail right after and we‚Äôre shocked that we were the only ones there. It was early morning, but on a Sunday we figured there would at least be a couple other folks milling about. We had the General Sherman tree all to ourselves for a good 10 minutes, which was an absolutely transcendent experience - just looking straight up at it and hearing nothing but birds and other forest sounds.

We then hiked the rest of the Congress Trail, also all to ourselves before heading back to camp for a siesta. Heading back up to the car we passed by the General Sherman again (around 10:30 am by this point) and wow what a zoo - hundreds of people now and loud as hell.

We spent the afternoon picnicking in Kings Canyon before heading back to Sequoia and Beetle Rock for sunset.

It was notable how quiet the trails were once you were about an 8th of a mile from the trailhead - most of the place we had to ourselves which really surprised us considering we were there Saturday/Sunday.

1fv4osu,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1fv4osu/when_my_homelab_went_down_a_journey_of_panic_and/,When My Homelab Went Down: A Journey of Panic and Persistence,"*This is just a aftermath of my morning, hope it is a good read for you.*

As a tech enthusiast, I take great pride in my homelab setup. It‚Äôs my personal slice of the internet where I experiment, learn, and run various services that I rely on. Everything was going smoothly‚Äîuntil that fateful morning when it all went dark.



**The Alarm**

It started innocently enough. In grabbed a cup of coffee was happy to have some relaxing time before the family comes for a visit on my day off. A notification popped up from my external monitoring service, bluntly telling me that my services were offline. My first thought? ‚ÄúThe internet must be down.‚Äù I rushed to check my ISP's router‚Äîeverything looked fine, green lights and all. So, the internet was up, but my network wasn't.

That‚Äôs when I turned my attention to the next logical suspect: my OPNsense firewall behind my ISP's router.



**The Firewall Freakout**

When I logged into the firewall, things were...off. Errors about buffers were splashed across the screen, making little sense to me at the time. I did what any sane person would do‚Äîreboot. But instead of a reboot solving everything, that‚Äôs when things really went downhill.

OPNsense refused to come back up. It was like it had taken the dive into oblivion and dragged my entire homelab down with it. Now it was time to roll up my sleeves.



**The Hunt for HDMI and Keyboard**

Of course, in moments like these, you realize just how long it‚Äôs been since you needed a wired keyboard or an HDMI cable. Cue the frantic search through drawers, boxes, and behind dusty shelves. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, I found what I needed. HDMI cable and keyboard in hand, I hooked them up to the firewall.

The OPNsense box was stuck in the boot menu. Not good.



**The Missing Interface Confusion**

I hit ‚ÄúEnter,‚Äù hoping for a magic fix. Instead, OPNsense asked me to configure the interfaces manually, which didn‚Äôt make sense. Why was it asking for this? I hadn‚Äôt changed anything! Then came the cryptic message: ""Missing default interface."" The confusion deepened, but I decided to push forward and configure the WAN and LAN interfaces manually.

No dice. The WAN wouldn't come up. Something bigger was wrong, but what?



**The Revelation: A Dead Interface**

After fiddling with cables, checking connections, and wondering why nothing was working, I finally had a lightbulb moment: ""Default interface missing"" wasn‚Äôt just a random error‚Äîit was trying to tell me something important. I tested the cable, and it was fine. But the WAN interface on the firewall, the port itself, was dead. Gone. Finished.



And because that WAN interface was tied to the default interface (which OPNsense couldn‚Äôt find anymore), it threw everything into disarray. All my neatly ordered interfaces‚ÄîLAN, WAN, and Management‚Äîwere scrambled, causing chaos.



**The Long Road to Recovery**

At this point, I had no choice but to manually configure the interfaces. First, I moved the WAN from the dead port (igc0) to a working one (igc2). But since OPNsense uses interface names for everything, this caused even more confusion. All my old configs, VLANs, and link aggregation settings (LAG) were referencing the old interface names.

Worse yet, in my panic, I had overwritten all the local backups on the firewall at this point. My NAS backups were unreachable for now, and time was ticking. I had to start from scratch, manually piecing together my configurations like a digital jigsaw puzzle.



**Slowly, Piece by Piece**

Once I‚Äôd manually set up the WAN on a new port and reconfigured the LAG and VLANs that were critical for my network, I finally started to see some light at the end of the tunnel. The network slowly came back online. I could access my PC again, and my services began breathing new life.



**The Aftermath and Learnings**

In the end, it took me from 9:22 AM to 11:50 AM to fully recover. Thankfully, it was a day off, and I didn‚Äôt have any urgent work commitments. But it was a stressful experience that left me with a few important lessons:

* Hardware can fail at any time. I always thought, ‚ÄúNah, this won‚Äôt happen to me.‚Äù It did. My WAN port just gave up on life. Never assume your hardware is invincible.
* Enable ‚ÄúPrevent Interface Deletion‚Äù for critical interfaces. This would have saved me so much grief by stopping the chaos that happened when OPNsense couldn‚Äôt find my WAN interface.
* Keep an up-to-date firewall backup on your PC or another easily accessible device. Relying on a NAS backup that you can't access is as good as not having one at all in these situations.
* Have a backup plan for your network infrastructure. I was fortunate I could switch on Wi-Fi on my ISP‚Äôs router if needed, but I‚Äôm now considering either a secondary firewall device or even a virtualized backup to step in if my primary hardware fails again.



**Final Thoughts**

No one likes when their homelab goes down, but it happens. This experience taught me that while it‚Äôs impossible to prevent every failure, you can make recovery smoother by planning ahead. With better backups, redundancy, and a plan B, future outages will (hopefully) be less stressful.

For now, the network is stable, but I‚Äôm keeping a much closer eye on my hardware, and this experience has me thinking: maybe it‚Äôs time to invest in some extra gear. After all, when you manage your own network, you are your own IT department, and no one likes being on the other end of a panicked support call‚Äîespecially when it‚Äôs your own voice you‚Äôre hearing.

Remember, the joy of backpacking is often in the unexpected discoveries, so leave room for spontaneity!

Week 1-2: Bangkok & Central Thailand (14 days)

* Spend 7-10 days in Bangkok
   * Explore at your own pace: Grand Palace, Wat Pho, local markets
   * Day trips to Ayutthaya or Kanchanaburi if you feel like it
   * Plenty of time for street food, parks, and people-watching
* Head to Kanchanaburi for 4-7 days
   * River Kwai, waterfalls, national parks
   * Chill by the river, read a book, chat with locals

Week 3: Choose your vibe (7 days) Option A: Northern Relaxation (Chiang Mai)

* Old City temples, night markets
* Mountain scenery, coffee shops
* Day trips to Doi Suthep or an ethical elephant sanctuary

Option B: Beach Life (Krabi or one island)

* Railay Beach or pick an island like Koh Lanta
* Beachside lounging, island vibes
* Optional island hopping or snorkeling if you're feeling adventurous

Tips:

1. Don't overplan - leave room for days where you do nothing
2. Stay in places with good common areas to meet people
3. Use overnight trains/buses for longer journeys to save a day
4. Embrace the Thai concept of ""sabai sabai"" (relaxed and content)

Remember, it's your trip. If you're loving a place, stay longer. If it's not your scene, move on. The beauty of backpacking is the freedom to go with the flow.

I thought I'd share it with the community here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1bo9tdq/introducing_hoarder_an_open_source/)) in case someone else finds it useful. I had zero expectations. Maybe a couple of stars on the repo and that's it. And boy, I was so wrong!

The reddit post received more engagement than what I'd have ever imagined. Suddenly, there's a lot of people using Hoarder, requesting features, and reporting bugs. I was so excited the first time I got a pull request in the repo. It was the usual typo fixes in the documentation, etc but still, someone took the time to contribute to Hoarder which I appreciated. A couple of days layer, out of nowhere, someone managed to navigate my code and submitted [a pull request](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder/pull/88) for a full fledged feature end to end without me even knowing it was happening. Suddenly, Hoarder got PDF support. The power of open source!

You can't imagine how happy I get every time I see someone recommending Hoarder in one of the comments in this sub. Every time someone posts a screenshot of their self hosted dashboards, I skim through their apps to see if Hoarder makes an appearance there. And today, I woke up on a video from u/davidnburgess34 showcasing Hoarder ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dklvlJ4YDtM)) that has thousands of views. This all started from just one post here, and I'm so grateful to this community.

I haven't made any posts since the initial announcement of Hoarder 6 months ago as I didn't want to spam the sub with updates. Also u/shol-ly's great newsletter of ""This week in self-hosted"" already covers every release of Hoarder. But given that we recently hit 3k stars on github, I thought I can give you a quick summary about what changed since the initial announcement!

**So what is Hoarder?** Hoarder is an open-source self-hosted bookmark-everything app with a touch of AI. You throw in anything you want (links, text, images, pdfs) and Hoarder will use LLMs to understand this content and automatically generate a bunch of tags for this content. Hoarder will also index this content giving you a blazingly fast full text search experience for faster retrieval! Hoarder provides browser extensions and mobile apps to minimize the friction of hoarding stuff!

So what changed since the announcement?

* Hoarder today has 3.5k stars on github, 17 awesome contributors and a small [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NrgeYywsFh) with 82 users!
* Local LLMs using Ollama: This was the very first request when I announced Hoarder here!
* Official mobile apps for both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hoarder-app/id6479258022) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.hoarder.hoardermobile&hl=en_US) are out of beta and are available in the app/play stores. They are also now more feature rich compared to the initial version which was a bit more barebones.
* Both [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hoarder/) and [chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hoarder/kgcjekpmcjjogibpjebkhaanilehneje?hl=en) now have browser extensions with the ability to add tags and lists.
* [Unraid templates](https://docs.hoarder.app/Installation/unraid) that are community maintained, and kubernetes [deployment instructions](https://docs.hoarder.app/Installation/kubernetes). The docker compose file itself is simpler by dropping the redis dependency and merging the web and workers containers (3 containers down from 5).
* OpenAI integration is cheaper than ever: With the release of `gpt-4o-mini` you can generate tags literally for thousands of bookmarks and images for less than a $1.
* To protect against link rot, Hoarder now can be configured to take full page offline archives (and screenshots) for the links you hoard.
* Bulk actions to mass edit your bookmarks!
* SSO support to login with authentik, authelia, etc.
* Nested lists are now a thing.
* Proper importing mechanisms from chrome, pocket and other netscape HTML formats preserving the tags and the titles of those imported bookmarks.
* Attach notes to your bookmarks and customize the image banners.
* Different layouts for your bookmark list (Masonry, Grid, List & Compact).
* A tags cleanup feature that detects duplicates in your tags and suggests merging suggestions.
* A [CLI](https://docs.hoarder.app/command-line) for those who want extra powers when manipulating their bookmarks.
* And a lot more that you can find by browsing through the [release notes](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder/releases).
* In the next release, we'll also give you the ability to specify tagging rules in natural language (aka customizing the prompt!).

As you can tell, a lot has changed in 6 months. I'm really grateful to our awesome contributors who contributed a bunch of the features I listed above, to our users, and to this community without which Hoarder wouldn't have gained any traction. Thank you!

*If you're enjoying Hoarder and you want to support it: drop the repo a star, review the mobile apps and browser extension and you can buy me a coffee from the link in the repo if you want :)*",82,1727951385.0,selfhosted,14,0.97,False

Utilizing the framework of the Town Center Conceptual Plan, we have designed a dynamic entertainment destination known as Broadway Live.  Broadway Live will be anchored by a 16,400sf Food Hall with five food vendors, a large indoor-outdoor bar, a large interior stage, along with an upstairs golf-themed bar & lounge called ‚ÄòThe Club House‚Äô.

Surrounding the Food Hall is a walkable urban streetscape that includes five additional dining & dessert options, eight-to-ten retail and service vendors, as well as a uniquely-branded bar & lounge.  This dynamic streetscape feeds into the William F. Breck Public Plaza, where large LED screens will feature live sporting events, movie nights and other programming.  This plaza will serve as the connecting hub for the entire Grove City Town Center; where 250 public parking spaces offer walkable connections to Beulah Park, as well as the Town Center Park & Stage via the eventual First Street Pedestrian Promenade.

Also included in our proposal is ‚ÄòThe Apex‚Äô at Broadway Live, a 150+ unit luxury apartment building.  This building, along with Broadway Live would provide dramatic architectural features demonstrating and highlighting the rich history and unique character of the Grove City Town Center.  The project proposes to provide nearly an acre of dedicated open green space.

This Development would be a catalyst for the continued growth and vibrancy of the Grove City Town Center and would create a dining and entertainment destination for all of the residents throughout Grove City. This destination effect would greatly help to further support all of the existing small businesses located in the Town Center. The Project is expected to directly catalyze additional private and public development in Grove City.

#Ryancohen #gamestop #entertaiment #business #marketing  GameStop Visionary Expansion Proposal: Transforming GameStop into an All-Encompassing Entertainment Hub

 A Vision to Redefine GameStop for the Next Era of Entertainment, Investment, and Gaming

I present to you a transformative vision to elevate GameStop beyond its traditional retail roots, evolving it into a groundbreaking entertainment giant that merges gaming, investing, and experiential entertainment. This proposal outlines a future where GameStop becomes the ultimate entertainment destination, combining multiple innovative revenue streams. The future I envision not only enhances the experience for customers but also fosters a deep, emotional connection with them‚Äîturning them into loyal players, investors, and fans.

1. Smart Gambling & Investing: Video Slot Games for Real Estate Investments

Concept: ""Gambling Meets Investing"" ‚Äì Not Just Gambling, But Skilled Investing**  
GameStop will introduce an exciting way for players to invest while they play. Players will engage with our video slot games where a portion of every wager is converted into investments in real estate or GameStop shares:

- Players as Investors: As players enjoy the thrill of gambling, they invest in real estate properties or GME stock. A player card, linked to their bank account, tracks both gambling activity and investment growth. 
- Cashing Out Winnings: Players can cash out 50% of their winnings immediately, while the other 50% is invested, earning annualized returns. Interest earned can be reinvested or withdrawn monthly.
- Mitigated Losses: Players who lose will still benefit, as 10% of their losses will be invested in a real estate project, earning annual returns and ensuring a positive outcome for every experience.
- Slot Game App for Nationwide Access: For states without physical video slot games, an app version will be available, allowing players to direct deposit, select properties to invest in, and enjoy the thrill remotely‚Äîall while growing their investments.

2. GameStop Entertainment Complex: Creating Unforgettable Experiences

Reimagining GameStop Spaces
Transform GameStop locations into full-scale entertainment complexes. More than a retail store, GameStop becomes a community hub for gamers and families, offering something for everyone:

- Interactive Entertainment Zones: 
  - Birthday party rooms, rentable event spaces, and private gaming lounges.
  - Vintage and modern arcade games where players can trade ticket winnings for used games and GameStop merchandise.
  - Indoor playgrounds for kids, gaming-themed summer camps, and themed gaming rooms with specialized setups for dedicated gamers.
  - Coffee bars, adult beverage bars, and classic concession stand food to enhance the experience.
- Annual Events & Entertainment: Host concerts in store parking lots during the summer, livestream events featuring popular gamers, and organize VIP meet-and-greets for shareholders, fostering deeper community engagement.
- Expansion into Retail: Create a section selling toys (since Toys R Us is no longer around), add popular Hot Topic-style merchandise, rock & roll T-shirts, and nostalgic items from the 80s to early 2000s, driving in consumers drawn by nostalgia and novelty.

Venue Expansion
To accommodate larger entertainment complexes, GameStop can take over spaces left by former retail giants (like Sears, Toys R Us, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Kmart) to create something more engaging than Chuck E. Cheese or Dave & Buster‚Äôs.

3. GameStop Cruises & Partnerships: Reaching the High Seas and Beyond

GameStop Themed Cruises
Bring GameStop experiences to the high seas with specialized themed cruises:

- Partner with Disney Cruises: Feature arcade rooms, gaming areas, and even slot games linked to investments.
- Singles Cruise & Themed Events: Host singles cruises or summer parties with gaming influencers, bringing popular figures like Tony Hawk for special guest appearances, autograph sessions, and themed merchandise.
- Decade-Themed Cruises: Offer decade-themed cruises (80s, 90s, early 2000s), allowing passengers to relive their favorite gaming eras, complete with themed parties, music, and merchandise from each era.

Casino & Slot Machine Vendors
- Partner with casinos and bars to install GameStop-branded slot machines that allow players to accumulate GameStop shares through gameplay, reinforcing the idea of gaming as a vehicle for investing.
- Develop partnerships with pizza places, bowling alleys, and other social venues, becoming an amusement vendor for arcade games and providing GameStop slot machines with revenue splits in cash or GME shares.

4. Partnerships, Merchandise, and Expanding the Retail Presence

Multi-Faceted Merchandise Offerings 
Transform the GameStop brand into more than just games:

- Hot Topic-Style Retail: Offer non-gaming retail items like rock and roll apparel, nostalgic items (slap bracelets, Tamagotchis, POGs), and classic arcade merchandise.
- Expand Beyond Stores: Install GameStop kiosk games in bars and restaurants, with revenue-sharing models that involve cash, GameStop shares, or a combination of both.

Redbox & Digital Expansion
- Partnership or Buyout of Redbox: Utilize Redbox kiosks to sell tickets with digital download codes and allow purchases that reward customers with GME shares. Continue to offer DVD and game rentals with the option to purchase and receive GME shares.

5. GameStop Gaming Temple: A Flagship Destination

National & Global Gaming Temple  
- Create a flagship GameStop gaming temple in multiple destinations where all bets are off, offering everything from classic arcade games to a full-blown casino environment.
- Partner with hotels to install games in rooms, make deals with all major gaming companies, and feature an interactive entertainment space that merges gambling, gaming, and traditional media.

GameStop‚Äôs Edge in Partnership  
- Establish strategic partnerships with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple for exclusive content, gaming events, and more.
- Use nostalgia-driven campaigns and family-friendly environments to attract various demographics‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs die-hard gamers or families looking for entertainment.

6. Vision for the Future: More Than a Gaming Company

A Comprehensive Entertainment Brand 
GameStop has the potential to become a major player in the entertainment industry, seamlessly blending gaming, investing, retail, and experiences across multiple sectors. By providing players the opportunity to invest as they game, GameStop becomes an innovator, turning a typical leisure activity into a value-driven investment opportunity. 

This vision requires GameStop to think beyond its current identity and step into a future that integrates digital transformation, diverse entertainment offerings, and an emotional bond with its audience. With this strategy, GameStop could capture new markets, revitalize brand loyalty, and create a compelling and exciting experience that customers can't get enough of.


My role in this proposal is that of a visionary, providing the ideas and creative direction, while GameStop takes on the role of executor, bringing this vision to life. This plan is designed to leverage your established brand and elevate it into something much more‚Äîa company that doesn‚Äôt just sell games but creates experiences, communities, and investment opportunities that benefit everyone.

Ryan, GameStop has always had a strong community of supporters, and now is the time to transform that passion into something greater. Let‚Äôs make GameStop the ultimate entertainment destination‚Äîone that takes gaming to new heights and turns every customer into a player, a shareholder, and an enthusiast for life.
