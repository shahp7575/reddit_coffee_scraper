2. Beverly Hills Polo Club Sport 9: my boyfriend's fav amongst the ones he owns


3. Contemporary - Police: we both don't care that much about this one


4. Ambre Noir - Yves Rocher: still my boyfriend's but it's too sweet for me, I have respect for it tho and it shows in the mb


5. Twilly - Herm√®s: my signature scent, I love it veryy much


6. Eau des Merveilles - Herm√®s: used to be my signature when I wore perfume on important occasions, I think it's still my favourite tho. I've always worn it while performing (middle school orchestra, now university choir) and I can smell it all day.


7. J'Adore - Dior: my mother's signature, she wears a dupe now but she never changed her scent since my childhood! Very classy even if she wouldn't describe herself as classy.


8. Team Force - Adidas: my dad's perfume. He likes it, we like it, it's super affordable, perfect!


9. Velvet Petals - Victoria's Secret (body mist): this is my sister's, I'm afraid I don't like this one but it's interesting.


10. Tentazione Donna - Comin: an italian low cost perfume, probably a dupe but we don't know of what. It's my sister's.


11. Black Opium - YSL: my sister owned a dupe for long that was maybe more coffee leaning, but we also have the original's tester. She says this one is very nostalgic.


12. Angel Muse - Mugler: ok so SOMEHOW we got a lot of testers, like three or four, and she was able to try it and enjoy it. Even if I don't wear it myself it reminds me of an annual celebration we go to near new year's eve.


13. Green tea - Elizabeth Arden: it was a gift and nobody really wears it regularly, my mom did a couple times. It's good but I never cared for it sadly!


14. Chanel n5: a little bit of a bonus, I own a tester that dates pre-reformulation, I find the scent really interesting despite it not being my cup of tea.

Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

**Who am I?**

* *26-year-old white male from the land of kangaroos and coffee (Melbourne, Australia).*
* *Standing tall at 6‚Äô0‚Äù (183cm) with a slim, athletic build. Think of me as a lean, mean trivia machine (more on that later).*
* *I‚Äôm an associate lawyer with a Law/Science degree, so I can help you win arguments‚Äîor at least tell you when you‚Äôre winning them.*
* *I‚Äôm passionate about a million things, so boredom is never an option.*

**What I‚Äôm into:**

* *Learning new things‚ÄîI‚Äôve even been on TV for a trivia show!*
* *Socialising and meeting new people. The more, the merrier (unless they‚Äôre the type who talks excessively during movies).*
* *Sports‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs kicking a soccer ball around or hitting the tennis courts, I‚Äôm game.*
* *Adventures‚Äîhiking, museum hopping, or spontaneous road trips? Sign me up!*
* *Movies‚Äîaction and comedy are my jam, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.*
* *Creative stuff‚Äîlike graphic design. Who knew being a lawyer could be so artsy?*
* *Staying fit‚ÄîI work out regularly because, hey, someone‚Äôs got to keep the doctors out of business.*

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* *A kind and compassionate woman who‚Äôs driven, takes care of herself, and shares a non-religious outlook on life.*
* *Someone who can laugh at my bad jokes, indulge in deep conversations, and isn‚Äôt afraid to dream big.*
* *And hey, nothing personal at all, but I'm only really into Caucasians/Hispanics/Latinos*

1h39jp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gentleparenting/comments/1h39jp0/stern_parenting_husband_is_convinced_gentle/,Stern parenting?? Husband is convinced gentle parenting will make our son ‚Äúweak‚Äù ,"My husband has recently taken on this new role of parenting where whenever our two year old does something he deems unacceptable he slightly raises his voice in sound but deepens the tone of his voice and will say ‚Äústop doing that‚Äù or ‚Äúhey! No! We‚Äôre all done‚Äù etc. 

To me it‚Äôs yelling. I don‚Äôt raise my voice at our son. If he does something I don‚Äôt like I make it clear we‚Äôre not doing that anymore and then I redirect if possible. But still hold firm boundaries. 

I tried explaining to my husband that it‚Äôs yelling, it makes me uncomfortable and it‚Äôs not how we agreed to raise our son. He usually responds that he‚Äôs not ‚Äúyelling‚Äù it‚Äôs being ‚Äústern‚Äù and then he‚Äôll say he didn‚Äôt agree to gentle parent our son, I decided for him. Not true. We had many talks while pregnant. We were both raised in very abusive households. We agreed to not raise our son like that etc. 


He also has stated that he needs to be ‚Äústern‚Äù with him or he won‚Äôt grow up ‚Äúto be a man‚Äù. Whatever that‚Äôs supposed to mean. He said he doesn‚Äôt want him to be ‚Äúweak‚Äù. I again tried explaining that a real man is someone who knows compassion, can also be gentle and emotionally stable. And we don‚Äôt need to raise our voice to raise our son to be a good person. At this point though my husband is usually just done listening. 

I think it bothers me most because it‚Äôll be over almost every little thing our son does. Even normal toddler things. Like He will just be playing with things we have on our coffee table (not even hurting them or being rough, just exploring) and he‚Äôll use his ‚Äústern‚Äù voice and tell him to stop or get away from it etc. 

How do I get my husband to stop using a stern voice with our two year old and just talk to him like a human being not the dog???",1,1732961168.0,gentleparenting,0,1.0,False

So I have been searching for years to no avail, but hopefully someone here knows what I'm talking about or where to look. I've already googled, and gone to adland and internet archive as well.

M: What are you doing here?

W: You said you wanted to see me again.

M: I said we could have coffee some time.

W: We can get coffee right now.

There are some other responses from the man, but the woman also says that she alphabetized his CDs, and it ends with the man saying ""Hey, where's my cat?""

","A Promising Elixir I used the Nagano Tonic over the past month, drawn in by its claims of revitalizing energy and promoting overall well-being. Crafted from a blend of traditional Japanese herbs and modern scientific research, this tonic promises a natural boost without the crash of caffeine or artificial stimulants. With scepticism and curiosity in equal measure, I embarked on this journey to uncover the truth behind the hype.

Each component is meticulously selected for its potential health benefits, offering a holistic approach to wellness.

A Delightful Fusion Upon the first sip, I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle yet complex flavour profile of Nagano Tonic. The sweetness of the berries is balanced by earthy undertones, creating a harmonious fusion that is both refreshing and soothing.

1h39cm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/1h39cm1/start_low_or_straight_to_the_good_sippers/,"Start low or straight to the ""good"" sippers?","Hi all, I'm keen to hear thoughts on getting into (largely) sipping rums please. I had a bottle of dark spiced rum a few months ago and loved it, so I bought another bottle but found myself completely unmoved. I'd enjoyed it initially because it was easy drinking but I started to think what's the point - if I could down a bottle of this like squash then why not have squash and save the calories/cost/hangover. 

Instead, I thought I'd try to find something more interesting (whatever rum I could actually taste through the sugar in the spiced rum, I liked). I looked at some reviews and settled on Appleton 8/12 and took a punt on the 8. I also bought some miniatures including  Pussers GP, Wray and Nephew overproof and El Dorado 12. Also had Doorlys 12 and 14 in restaurants. 

I've loved it all and polished it off in a couple of weeks. I'd like to get more but one thing I'd like to do this time is get a small selection so that I get the benefit of comparing them. There are loads of black Friday deals on Amazon for the rums most discussed on here as good starters so feels like a good time to pick up a few. 

I really loved the Appleton and don't regret for a second getting the younger bottle. In many aspects of life I think you quickly get used to what you have. I drove a shit heap for years and thought nothing of it, got quite a comfortable car and loved the upgrade for three months because I appreciated it, but now, again, think almost nothing of it. Have done the same, variously, with coffee, beer, motorcycles, clothing etc. 

So I suppose my question is this - shall I keep going low for a bit? Shall I try Appleton Signature, Doorlys 3 or 5 (can't get the 8 in the UK annoyingly or I think that would be the choice), El Dorado 5 and sip my way through those before doing a later round with the 12s and 15s. Or is there a floor below which you don't want to be sipping and it won't be worth the time, money, liver damage etc just to reach a conclusion that the 12s are better sippers? I want to really enjoy them now obviously as well as enjoy developing an affinity with rum in the longer term. I'm also mindful that it's cold wet December and Xmas so I'd value the complexity and darkness now perhaps in the way I'm drinking more than I would if I was drinking outside on warm June evenings. 

Anyway, welcome your thoughts and any contributions very much appreciated thank you.

i had another friendsgiving dinner today and was so scared id binge, but approached it rationally: i had some black coffee before i left as an appetite suppressant, started off with heaping amounts of salad and salmon, and slowly added the carb-heavier foods like mac n cheese from there if i wanted it. it worked!!! i did eat more than i would on a usual day, and ended with a slice of cake, but i feel okay and ended at 113.5 tonight.

Moving on. I fill water until the mark and press. I'm using the pressurized basket as recommended. I'm halfway through the press but the pressure guage doesn't move at all. So I press a little more and coffee starts dripping but the guage still didn't hit the marked espresso range. I keep pushing and it barely touches the range and by then the handle is all the way down.

So I'm wondering, what went wrong here? In the videos I saw, the pressure hits mid of the range almost instantly and stays there for the entire duration of the brew.

In terms of ratio, 15gms coffee in, 31gms out in about 50 seconds. Brew time suggests coffee is too fine but pressure indicates it's too coarse? 

This is how the basket looked like after the brew. The coffee though tastes ok. Better than moka pot and I can feel some taste notes unlike the moka pot coffee (ignore the sorry attempt at latte art :D) ",1,1732959758.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

1h396h6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h396h6,Need help with Neo flex,"So I got my neo flex yesterday and tried to give it a shot. For context, making espresso for the time, been using moka pot so far. 

I get 15gms beans grinded in kingrinder k6 at 40 clicks. Looks fine enough. Lesson 1 - flex basket is not big enough for 15 üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

Moving on. I fill water until the market and press. I'm using the pressurized basket as recommended. I'm halfway through the press but the pressure Guage doesn't move. So I press a little more and coffee starts dripping but the Guage still didn't hit the marked espresso range. I keep pushing and it barely touches the range and by then the handle is all the way down.

So I'm wondering, what went wrong here? In the videos I saw, the pressure hits mid of the range almost instantly ans stays there for the entire duration of the brew.

In terms of ratio, 15gms coffee in, 31gms out in about 50 seconds. Brew time suggests coffee is too fine but pressure indicates it's too coarse? 

This is how the basket looked like after the brew. The coffee though tastes ok. Better than moka pot and I can feel some taste notes unlike the moka pot coffee (ignore the sorry attempt at latte art :D) ",2,1732959550.0,IndiaCoffee,4,1.0,False

Hope you are enjoying your weekend.

I wanted to know what activities can one partake in that include not spending lots of money on random junk to wind off or deal with people complaining about shit (it‚Äôs an Egyptian trait).

I already walked the doggos around the house and took them to the groomers. Got a very nice cup of coffee and had a workout.

Also any tips how to avoid negativity and political and economical banter online since people just decided to completely become negative and complain about politics 24/7?

1h3954k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h3954k/guys_i_need_help_20m/,"Guys, i need help [20M]","So there is this girl , that i saw in the college library, i could her looking my way because for a second we made eye contact and it visibly startled her. I saw her a bunch of times in the library but never went on to talk to her cuz yes, i was being a wuss and i was really locked in. After this i didnt see her anywhere for like 2 weeks.

point to note, this is the prettiest girl with the prettiest smile that i have ever seen in my life, she is Swedish. no bs, this is a fact.

After a while, i saw her again studying in the library and this time i did go up to her (ohh it was nerve-racking but it had to be done) i talked to her for bit, she said she was glad i came over. i asked her if she wants to get a coffee sometime and then we exchanged Instagram and she told me to text her about the coffee. 

AT THIS POINT, DAMNNNNNN, i got the ig, mad stuff.

i had an assignment due the next day, i finished that up and then sent her a text. i asked her if she wants to go out for that coffee on friday. she said she was busy had lectures to get to, (acceptable, we in college). So i asked he if the weekend would work, she said that might work, soo i got to some research found a nice spot, got back to her with a time and date. Now she says next week would be better. to which i ask if weekend would suit or any off the weekdays that she would be free. Now she says tuesday. aight, shift of plans to tuesday, asked her if she wants to go for the same time, to which she says she can confirm later closer to the date.   
Then comes Monday, i text to confirm, she says she has to cancel, no reasons were given.  
My reply to this was, oh okay let me know if you still want to some other time or if you dont is all good. (like, no pressure). she says, after exam week. \[point to note, all of this is happening at the most inconvenient time, a few weeks before exams\]. To this my dumb brain replies, fair enough, hopefully see ya after exams, good luck with the prep. 

NOW, present times, she has been liking a few Instagram stories that i have posted here and there. my exams coming to an end soon (wooo hoooo), on the last one. DO I TEXT HER? WHAT DO I SAY??",12,1732959387.0,dating,5,1.0,False

Am I Broke or Just Normal?","Hey guys, I‚Äôve been doing some thinking (and a little Googling üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) about **savings goals for people in their late 20s living in KL**. It‚Äôs hard not to wonder‚Ä¶ *am I doing okay, or am I way off track?* So here‚Äôs what I found‚Äîlet me know if this checks out for you too:

# What‚Äôs Considered ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù Savings?

üí∏ **Age 28**: RM60k‚ÄìRM100k  
üí∏ **Age 29**: RM80k‚ÄìRM130k  
üí∏ **Age 30**: RM100k‚ÄìRM150k

This assumes you‚Äôre earning around RM4k‚ÄìRM8k, not paying rent (hi, staying with parents gang üëã), and you‚Äôre saving *at least 20‚Äì30% of your income*. 

# But what are some anomaly in savings?

**üöÄ High Savings (Overachievers Club)**

* **Age 28**: RM200k+
* **Age 29**: RM250k+
* **Age 30**: RM300k+ These are the ones earning RM8k+, investing early, and keeping their expenses low. Bonus points if they somehow avoid splurging on overpriced coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.

**üí∏ Low Savings (YOLO Squad)**

* **Age 28**: Below RM15k
* **Age 29**: Below RM20k
* **Age 30**: Below RM25k Could be due to spending too much, debts, or a bumpy career start. No judgment, life happens.

# Why This Matters (Sorta)

* If your savings look low, no need to panic, but maybe it‚Äôs time to start budgeting.
* If you‚Äôre on the high side - teach us your ways sifus ü´°

Money isn‚Äôt everything, but let‚Äôs be real, it helps. Whether you‚Äôre saving for your first house, starting a biz, or just avoiding makan maggi for the rest of your life, it‚Äôs good to know where you stand.

I've been in Australia for almost a year now, and since coming here I've been finding it really hard to get a job. A little bit abt me,  I'm Asian, 18yo, and I would say I'm pretty mature and I take having a job very seriously. My family is putting everything they have to get me to study here and hopefully have a better future, so that I can help myself and my younger sister, my parents never put pressure on me but they share our financial situations with me which is why I feel pressured to help ease them of that burden. They never asked me to do anything I'm not comfortable doing, all the pressure and stress is from me, it's to the point where I  sometimes find myself avoiding to call home bcus I don't wanna be stressed out abt money. I would promise myself to call with my family more often when I find a stable job to not worry them. Before coming here my family had to take out a big chunk of my tuition to pay for medical expenses, which is another reason I'm so stressed. 

My confidence this year has gone down the drain, I have only met @sshole employers who are either racist (even asian ones) or just @ssholes, it's so hard for me to find a job and idky, I do good at my job and I work incredibly hard, I know I have a lot to learn and I'm more then open to doing so, but recently I was let go bcus I'm not experienced enough again, I thought this place would finally accept me and I would get to learn batista and bartending skills but seems I'm wrong, the ppl was so nice and I had finally had hope again but the news rlly sprung up on me, and now I'm depressed and stressed again. I'm also quite a shy person who needs a little time to warm up and get chatty, and I've been pretty chatty with coworkers and customers, i have also been studying and practicing coffee making and making drinks in the bar. I've been working on myself to do better, but the manager told me that I'm inexperienced and I don't open up as much as she wants, (both my current, or now past, coworkers also studied bar and coffee thru this job so I thought I'd have a chance to do the same) it's only been 3 weeks and now I'm back to job hunting again. I'm incredibly disappointed in myself and idk how to explain it, I've tried to shorten my sxperience for u guys as much as I could, so I hope this does it.

Now after the second coffee spill, its not doing so great. I checked Corsair's latest K70 PRO but I dislike the magnetic palm rest; only the TKL model looks more tight.

I'm looking for a full wired mechanical keyboard similar to K70, with some basic media controls (volume, mute especially) and a key backlight (not necessarily RGB). Not really fixed on hot-swap/custom building.

I game a lot, mostly FPS and RPG games -- but also write a lot as part of my job and research work; so I guess Red-like linear switches might be best (I'm open to suggestions). The idea is to put less strain on my fingers and hands.

I also tested and liked the feel of Keychron but I'm not sure which model to aim for or if I should look into any other producer? Thank you for your help.",1,1732958494.0,keyboards,0,1.0,False
1h38y55,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1h38y55/husband_is_checked_out_emotionally/,Husband is checked out emotionally ,"I know this isn't the typical post format, however it makes it easier on myself to break it down this way. It's a longer story and I apologize for that, I just have to put all the info on the table for transparency.

For context; Husband is (37m), myself ( Wife, 27F). We've been together for 6 years, have two special needs children, he works full time at a physically demanding job, I am a SAHM (not as physically demanding as his job but very mentally & emotionally) Absolutely zero support system. He has unmedicated ADHD & I have an unmedicated Bipolar disorder. We have lived around this the whole time with patience, grace, & forgiveness.

What the issue at hand is: I feel very emotionally, mentally, & physically neglected. We have had many talks about this over the years, a few arguments, and finally the big ""Let's question our marriage and re-evaluate what you actually do for me, if you're that unhappy then leave"" fight last night.

What I need insight & advice on: When is it time to call it quits & move on, if I even should given the circumstances.

Our backstory: When I got into a relationship with my husband, things were absolutely amazing. Constant date nights, a fulfilling intimate life, the absolute works on everything romantic. It was honestly a fairytale relationship on both of our ends. Life hit and before kids we were homeless for a year and really struggling. We both managed to work and make ends meet and even though this was an extremely hard time in our life, our relationship was still great. So it's not like we haven't been through major stressors & really struggled before. We also don't have any form of a support system. Sure, people to call and ask how they're doing but no more than that. It's been rough. When we had our first, everything seemed fine and she was meeting all her milestones so there wasn't any indication at the time of autism she was a dream baby, giggly and babbling. I got pregnant again at 4 months post-partum and had a boy that also has autism & adhd. With love I say that he his more difficult (for lack of a better word) than her for me to handle but I am still learning about him and his needs. He is the very hands on child while she is not as much. Both of their *issues* include not being potty trained, low verbal, daily melt downs (Sometimes several times a day starting as soon as we wake up and with every routine) that include screaming, kicking, falling to the floor, ect. My boy is a major sensory seeker (climbing and jumping off of furniture, throwing things around, making messes with food constantly, ect) my girl isn't that extent but has her days as well. For the longest time, they both were unfortunately very infatuated with fecal matter and that was the most stressful time in my life for obvious reasons. All of this being said, there was a situation that happened that I am very ashamed of. We considered adoption and even met one family. Husband was persistent that our children deserved a a family with more resources. We met the family but in my heart I couldn't do it. I cried all the time about it and couldn't eat without breaking down into tears, it was very emotionally hard and I don't know if I made the right call for everyone. I had researched adoption trauma and even though I did feel like on paper they would be better off with a family with more that I could ever offer, I didn't want to feel like I was ""giving up on them"". It felt like we were trying to re-home pets that were too much to handle or something.  Now granted, I was very adamant that I did not want children in the first place, at least until we were in a better position however he was persistent on that he did and we would have help (We don't, surprise) and while they weren't planned, I do feel like to this day he disregarded my wishes on that and got me pregnant on purpose even though he says he didn't. It is what it is, I don't dwell on it. 
**I didn't mention it anywhere else but I 100% take care of the house and kids, no ""we trade off or he helps out"" I cook, clean, and take care of the kids ALL of the time. Last time I had 1 day to myself was in June. It's 24/7 for me. He works 6 days a week, 7am-3/5pm depending. He gets Sundays to himself. His work however is VERY physically demanding so I gladly take on my role and do my best to take care of the house since he does keep a roof over our head and pay for everything. I am grateful for that. 


The MAIN issue & our big fight: Our issue is most likely just me, I am a full time caretaker/housekeeper and I feel very, very lonely. I am unable to work and meet anyone to become friends with  because 1. We moved somewhere very rural and 2. It's hard enough to meet friends being married with kids, let alone kids with special needs. I feel very alienated and used to be such an outgoing social butterfly. I am now an absolute recluse and can't go inside the grocery store without my fight or flight instinct being activated. So because we are married, I figure I can lean on my husband. Unfortunately this is not the case. We have absolutely no romance or intimacy and I cannot talk to him about my feelings without him getting upset anymore. It's been like this for around 2 years. This is extremely hard on me because I desperately crave connection and have the worst time trying to open up about what's going on inside me. So when I share with him that I feel disconnected and get nothing but crickets back it absolutely breaks my heart. The non existent sex life I can cope with, but the lack of being intimate I cannot. I can't even hug him anymore without ""I don't feel like being touched right now"" let alone kiss or cuddle. Today (last night but I'm still awake) it came to an ugly head. He came inside from work and I try the usual, how was your day, wanna take a shower together or something? Maybe watch a show & cuddle? And met with ""No I'm just gonna do my thing"". And I felt something inside me snap. I tried to be calm but all my bottled feelings and emotions reared it's ugly head. I tried like hell to calm down but I couldn't. He walked past me and went directly to the bedroom and shut the door. I followed him and started in on him. I told him I am beyond tired being the only one that gives a F about our relationship, that even on my hardest days I just want to spend time with him and it effing hurts me when he doesn't reciprocate the feeling at all. That this all feels like a huge mistake to me & it's getting to heavy to handle, why doesn't he want to spend time with me or love me anymore. Which I'm met with, ""I work all day to feed your effing mouth, what do you ACTUALLY do for me that I can't do myself? I told you we should've done adoption and it wouldn't be like this, this is a lot on me too. Sorry I don't feel like being touched or anything but I just don't want to, why can't you respect that. If you want to go just go then"". I broke down into tears and went into the living room, he followed me back and asked what my problem is and that ""I need to stop being a C, he works too hard for all this BS"". I just asked him to leave me alone because I was completely breaking down and I couldn't handle all my emotions, my heart felt like it was ripped into shreds and I had the worst lump in my throat and couldn't compose myself. And so he did. And again, I am left sleeping on the couch wondering when is enough, enough? Is it time to start thinking of the alternative and leaving? Should I continue to smile and make his coffee everyday &  put my needs to the side because of our situation? It's hard enough without working to take care of the kids fulltime. I imagine if we separated I would have full custody of them as he cannot handle their needs and makes it clear to me. He is a great dad to them otherwise and he does take care of us financially. I'd hate to break my family up by leaving but I am drowning without any love or support. I don't even know if it would make a difference if I left. I feel completely & utterly lost on what to do but I know it cannot keep going on the way it is, my mental health and self worth deteriorates more and more every day. I just want my love & best friend back but I don't know if I'm waiting on something that might not happen with us again. I've never been pushy about my needs, sure I mention it but we usually have respectful conversations. I do my best to make him feel special a lot. Always getting his work clothes together, making him his favorite desserts, giving him massages to help all his muscles, telling him I love him and appreciate everything he does, asking him about his day and if there is anything I can do for him, anytime he needs something I jump up to go do it immediately even if I'm preoccupied. I do what I can with what I have for him. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I assume (wrongly perhaps?) that many of us are looking at DAP as a portable, hi-fi audio device to bring at work, at the library, at the coffee shop, etc. But nobody or very few people post about that part of the experience.

Example: I'm thinking of getting my first DAP, and as for many I'm trying to find the right product that has performance, user experience, size and the right price.

Everyone be talking about the Hiby R4, but nobody is talking about how is it to carry that chonky mf around. How heavy is it? Where do you physically put it? (in your pockets? somewhere else?) During which activities are you using it?

So, of course, the internet had to ruin their day.

I tossed a few bucks into the stock, you know, just for fun. And bam! The price skyrockets. Like, from ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs cool‚Äù to ‚ÄúHoly crap, I‚Äôm rich!‚Äù It was nuts. I‚Äôd wake up, check the price, and nearly spill my coffee each morning. My phone buzzed non-stop. My mom even asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this ‚Äòstonk‚Äô thing you keep talking about?‚Äù

And the memes? Hilarious. It felt like we were all in this together, laughing while hedge fund managers sweat bullets. They had no clue what hit them. Every dollar the stock climbed was a victory lap for us little guys.

One day, the price shoots up past $300, and I‚Äôm sitting there like, ‚ÄúWait, is this real life?‚Äù I sold at the peak, took a victory lap around my house, and treated myself to, well‚Ä¶ everything.

The first scratch was so soft that Emma Walker thought she'd imagined it. A delicate scraping behind the bedroom wall, like fingernails searching for purchase. But it was persistent‚Äîa constant, maddening whisper that grew louder with each passing night.

Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.

The sound seemed to pulse with a terrible rhythm, synchronized with the ragged beating of her own exhausted heart. Emma pressed her palms against her ears, but the noise only intensified. It wasn't just a sound anymore. It was a presence.

Yet the scratching wasn't what truly terrified her. It was Benji.

Her nine-year-old son had changed. Where once he'd been a bundle of curiosity and childlike wonder, now he moved with an unsettling stillness. His eyes, once bright and searching, now held a calculating calm that made the hair on the back of her neck stand on end.

Something was happening to her child. Something beyond grief. Beyond understanding.

Tonight was different.

The soft laughter drifting from Benji's room pulled her from a restless sleep. Moonlight spilled across the hardwood hallway as she approached, her bare feet silent against the cold floor. Her hand trembled as she reached for the doorknob.

Benji sat cross-legged on the wooden floor, surrounded by a careful arrangement of smooth black stones she was certain hadn't existed in the house before. They gleamed with an unnatural darkness, absorbing what little light filtered through the curtains.

""Benji?"" she whispered.

He looked up, and in that moment, Emma saw something alien in her son's gaze. Something that didn't belong to her. Something that didn't belong to any human.

""She told me you wouldn't understand,"" Benji said, his voice flat and emotionless.

Outside the window, something moved between the trees. A flash of white. A glimpse of something tall and impossibly thin.

And then silence.

""Her Silent Game!""

One Month Earlier

The house stood isolated, a weathered farmhouse surrounded by dense forest that seemed to breathe and shift with each passing breeze. Pale morning light filtered through dusty windows, illuminating cardboard boxes yet to be unpacked. Emma's fingers traced the worn wooden frames, trying to convince herself this move was a fresh start.

One month after her husband Michael's funeral, she'd sold everything. The memories in their old home were suffocating, each corner a painful reminder of the life they'd lost. Cancer had been merciless, taking Michael quickly and leaving behind a void that seemed to consume everything.

Thirty-five years old. A widow. A single mother to a grieving child.

""I'm going to unpack in the backyard,"" Benji called, his voice carrying a forced brightness that broke Emma's heart. Children were supposed to be resilient, everyone said. They were supposed to bounce back.

But she saw the shadows in her son's eyes. The way he'd gone quiet. The way he'd stopped asking questions.

The backyard was expansive, stretching into a dense forest that seemed to watch them. Old oak trees created a natural barrier, their branches twisting like gnarled fingers reaching toward the house. Emma watched through the kitchen window as Benji kicked at the soft earth, his movements mechanical and distracted.

""I found something!""

His voice cut through her melancholy. He stood near an old oak tree, mud-covered hands clutching an ornate wooden box. Its surface was intricately carved with geometric patterns that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles‚ÄîCeltic knots intertwining with symbols she didn't recognize.

""Look, Mom,"" he said, pulling open the lid to reveal a collection of perfectly smooth, jet-black stones.

Emma's first instinct was to brush it off as a child's innocent discovery. But something about those stones felt... wrong. Each one was identical‚Äîpolished to an impossible darkness that seemed to absorb the surrounding light. They were cool to the touch, almost unnaturally so, and when Benji placed them in her hand, she felt a strange tingling sensation.

""Can I keep them?"" Benji asked.

His eyes were bright again, a glimpse of the son she remembered. A spark of hope flickered in her chest.

""Of course,"" Emma replied, forcing a smile.

She didn't see the subtle curve of satisfaction that flickered across Benji's lips. Didn't notice how the stones seemed to pulse ever so slightly in his small hands.

The First Signs

That night, Emma heard Benji talking in his bedroom.

Normally, she would have found comfort in the sound. After Michael's death, Benji had become so quiet. But this was different. His voice was low, measured‚Äînot the typical childish babbling.

""The patterns have to be perfect,"" he was saying. ""Miss Ivory doesn't like imperfection.""

Emma froze in the hallway. Miss Ivory?

When she cracked open the door, Benji sat on the floor, the black stones arranged in intricate geometric designs. They seemed to create complex patterns that hurt her eyes if she stared too long.

""Who are you talking to, sweetie?"" she asked.

Benji didn't look up. ""Nobody, Mom. Just playing a game.""

But games, Emma would soon learn, were never just games in this house.

The Forest's Whispers

The first full week in the new house brought a series of small, unsettling changes.

Doors would close by themselves. Shadows would move in peripheral vision. And always, always, those black stones would appear in the most unexpected places.

""Miss Ivory likes to play games,"" Benji told Emma over breakfast, arranging the stones into yet another complex pattern. ""She says I'm her favorite.""

Emma stirred her coffee, choosing her words carefully. ""Who's Miss Ivory, sweetie?""

""The lady from the forest. She comes at night and teaches me special games."" His fingers moved with surprising precision, creating a design that looked almost like a ritualistic symbol.

Warning bells should have rung. But grief had dulled Emma's instincts, made her desperate to see her son happy again. She convinced herself it was normal‚Äîa child's way of processing loss, of creating comfort in a world suddenly devoid of his father.

She was wrong.

Nighttime Visitors

The first time Emma saw the figure, she thought she was dreaming.

A tall, impossibly thin woman dressed in a white gown that seemed to blend with the moonlight. Standing at the edge of the forest, watching the house. Watching Benji's bedroom window.

When Emma blinked, the figure was gone.

But the black stones remained, multiplying like a cancer spreading through their home.

The local library was a sanctuary of dust and forgotten memories. Wooden shelves towered like ancient sentinels, holding decades of local history between their weathered covers. Emma knew she was searching for something, though she couldn't yet define what.

The town of Millbrook had always been quiet. Isolated. The kind of place where secrets festered beneath a veneer of rural tranquility.

Mrs. Henderson, the librarian, watched Emma with suspicious eyes. She was a thin woman in her sixties, with hair pulled so tightly into a bun that her skin seemed stretched thin over her skull.

""Looking for something specific?"" she asked, her voice as dry as the pages surrounding them.

Emma hesitated. ""Local history. Specifically, any records about children... or strange occurrences.""

A flicker of something‚Äîfear? recognition?‚Äîpassed across the librarian's face. ""We don't discuss old stories,"" she said sharply. ""Some things are better left forgotten.""

But Emma was persistent.

The town archives were kept in a basement room, accessed through a narrow door behind the reference desk. Shelves lined with yellowed newspapers, leather-bound ledgers, and boxes of forgotten documents stretched into the shadows.

Her fingers trembled as she pulled out the oldest records.

The first file that caught her attention was from 1953. A missing persons report. Margaret Holbrook and her son, Thomas, had vanished without a trace. The file was thin, with only a few sparse details.

Tucked between the official documents, she found a journal. Its pages were brittle, the ink faded but still legible.

June 15, 1953

Thomas has changed. He speaks of a woman who visits him at night. A woman in white who promises him games that no one else understands. I hear him talking to her, but when I enter his room, he's always alone.

But not truly alone.

Emma's skin crawled. The handwriting was desperate, the letters pressed so hard into the page that they had nearly torn through.

She watches. Always watching. Thomas says her name is Miss Ivory, and that she loves him more than I ever could.

More files revealed a pattern. Every few decades, a child would go missing. Always after speaking of a woman. Always after being seen playing with strange, dark objects.

The stones. Always the stones.

Benji's transformation was gradual, then suddenly absolute.

He stopped playing with normal toys. The black stones consumed his entire world. Hours would pass with him arranging and rearranging them, muttering under his breath in a language that didn't sound human.

""Don't touch!"" he'd snap when Emma approached. ""Miss Ivory will be angry.""

His love had turned to something else. Something colder. Something calculated.

""You killed Dad,"" he said one night, his eyes reflecting moonlight like polished obsidian. ""Miss Ivory told me. If you hadn't made him work so hard, he wouldn't have gotten sick.""

Each word was a knife, precise and cutting.

Emma felt her world fracture.

The stones were more than just objects now. They were a language. A ritual. Each arrangement told a story that Emma couldn't‚Äîwouldn't‚Äîunderstand.

At night, she would hear Benji talking. Not to her. Not to anyone human.

""Yes, Miss Ivory,"" he would say. ""I understand.""

And somewhere in the darkness, something would laugh.

The forest seemed to breathe around their house. Trees pressed closer with each passing night, their branches scratching against windows like desperate fingers seeking entry.

Benji began leaving offerings.

Small things at first. A favorite toy. A drawing. But soon, the offerings became more disturbing. A dead bird, carefully arranged on a black stone. A lock of hair. A photograph of Michael, torn into precise pieces.

Emma watched, helpless.

The night Miss Ivory truly revealed herself was during a storm. Lightning split the sky, illuminating the forest in stark, terrifying clarity.

Benji stood at the window, the black stones arranged in a perfect circle around him. His back was to Emma, but she could see the reflection in the glass.

A figure stood behind him. Tall. Impossibly thin. Dressed in a white gown that seemed woven from mist and moonlight.

Miss Ivory smiled.

And Emma understood. This wasn't just about Benji. This was a ritual older than time‚Äîa parasitic game that fed on maternal love, slowly replacing it with something cold and alien.

The final confrontation happened in the heart of the forest, where everything began.

Lightning fractured the sky. Rain hammered against ancient trees like a thousand desperate hands. Emma faced the entity known as Miss Ivory, her body trembling but her resolve unbroken.

""He is mine now,"" Miss Ivory said, her voice like breaking glass. Each word seemed to create fractures in reality itself. ""Children are so easily... redirected.""

The stones formed a complex pattern at their feet. A binding. A trap.

""Take me instead,"" Emma whispered.

Miss Ivory's smile was neither kind nor cruel. It simply was.

Years later, Emma watches from a distance.

Benji‚Äîno, the boy who was once her son‚Äîlives a normal life. He'll never remember her. Never know the sacrifice.

But in his pocket, a smooth black stone waits.

The game is never truly over.

Somewhere, Miss Ivory smiles.

The End.

Some games are meant to be played in silence.

Some bonds are meant to be broken.

And some mothers will do anything to save their children.

Mine is a free one and it probably falls under that category. So any suggestions for VPNs that do support it? I don‚Äôt mind paying a little if I have to. It really sucks that I got made.

I don‚Äôt plan on using the WiFi at my house again for such things unless I can guarantee a VPN working as I want. What do you suggest? Also any tips for torrenting? Or VPNs in general. I keep seeing to link my VPN to my torrent app to prevent them finding my IP. Not sure what that means so maybe an explanation would help. Or at least why that would help. My torrenting agent is QBittorent or something like that.

I understand people are not perfect but from time to time I can't get to terms with her at moments. I know she has her problems at work, housework (even if everyone is helping with housework at home despite her not realizing that) my grandma who is really old and sometimes is a pain in the ass but this doesn't mean you get to lash out on your kids.

 Today after waking upI heard her shouting at Grandma on the phone (Grandma probably told her something obscure and infuriating) and she decided to let it all out on me. I asked something about the coffee I had prepared the night before and she said that Dad probably drank it ""Do you have a problem with it"", I was like what's with that? She told me that she was mad about something but I told her that it's probably not my problem. She then replied that actually it was also my problem because I apparently emptied a nasal solution we had in the bathroom. Keep in mind I was sick the previous week and the solution was in the bathroom in plain sight and not mentioned that it's specifically hers. She eventually lashed out screaming like hell and smashing a cup on the floor. I told her that I couldn't deal with this kind of behaviour and that you are constantly trying to draw a reaction from me and use it against me. 

For example, the other day after WE cleaned the house she noticed some minor splashes on the kitchen floor. She probably thought I brought the whole Atlantic Ocean into our kitchen and started reacting hysterically. I can sometimes deal with stuff like that calmly but when she attacks me like that I lose my nerves and start building up dbs myself, not because I can't handle being pointed out that I did something wrong but because I can't stand being attacked like that all the time. Eventually, in times like this, I lose my cool and start arguing with her and start yelling myself and she uses that against me often with irony in her tone. And when you point out that you can't do that she'll give you the ""I'm your mother I'll do whatever I want."" 

She even brings out the fact that I'm not religious and she is often at very random moments and guilt trip you for that

It almost feels like she's trying to make me go mad. I understand that everyone has their problems, they get stressed out by them and often eat them but this behaviour is really anxious and toxic. I'm 23 like I demand some more respect on some level man... Not like it's okay to lash out at younger kids it really isn't but after a certain point in your life, you feel like you should be treated on more equal footing.

Sorry for venting out I'm kind of emotional at the moment. I'd really like some advice and help wit that. I've tried the typical not give any attention when someone acts hot but as you can understand it often doesn't work, or she doesn't let it work.",1,1732957603.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

1. Stop reading the fear online: i get people have had it for months and years and the stories but it dont matter, once you get the tools in place your going to be fine (i legit dont care of you‚Äôve had it for 7 years because if you apply the below your going to feel better.


It‚Äôs literally to do with your diet. Yes i know. Diet. 


1. Breakfast: frozen vegtables = broccoli, carrot, peas or any from your local supermarket

2. Lunch: subway wraps with lettuce tomato, carrot or chicken and salad on a plate

3. Dinner veggies with steak or chicken

4. Snacks: salt and vinegar chips, tomato on biscuits , pepsi max in doses 

5. No coffee, no sugar , no carbs (once your out of the dpdr state you can bring this back in)

6. Beer only if you do drink

7. Minimal masterbation , neck stretches before bed

8. The final major key: sunlight, i want you outside feeling the sun on you daily , you will feel like shit the same day and even the next but this is so so key.

You cant ‚Äúthink‚Äù your way out of dpdr, its literally about physically calming your body throughout actions, cutting the carbs and sugar and getting the sunlight and mentally saying: none of this matters


I see so much of this stuff written online over the years of what do i do im stuck, it can be stopped within 3-4 weeks.


Think of it this way: your body needs fuel to run your day , you‚Äôve never dedicated 4 weeks of your life to go above and beyond to let the body function but also get the vip service its been crying for , for years. Sugar is a deadset nightmare so forget the fast food, the little chocolate or the thickshake , it all goes 


This comes from someone who‚Äôs had dpdr on and off for 10 years, if i get it ^ i can get rid of it within 3 weeks by the above 


Hope this helps and once again for those stuck for years , ask yourself: have you truely dedicated yourself to something like a keto diet and sunlight for a month, i know the answer. Get moving and its gone.",3,1732957366.0,derealization,2,1.0,False

We had been together 12 years and had two children.  We have combined friends where the males were originally his mates. 

I waited for him to tell his mates prior to me telling their partners that I had left and why. 5 weeks later he told them. I asked him to confirm he had told them everything he said he had. Less then 24 hours later the requests for coffees came in for their partners. That's where I heard that he'd said he had a little anger problem and that we had broken up while he worked on it. They asked me my side as they were a little confused,  I told one of the girls bits of the truth (not everything) but explained the shoving. The threats of hitting, the  constant comments, the hitting in the past, and that I'd asked him to get help in March and he hadn't. 

They said they wanted to tell their partner and I said I would rather than him hearing it second hand.

His mate was shocked. Basically saying he hadn't said any of that. He told the guys and they all went to speak to him again. 

He called me after and said that my ex had shown no remorse and they were done with him until he could at least own what he did. 

It's now december and true to his word this guy refuses to acknowledge my ex, or invite him to things. My ex is still annoyed about this, saying I shouldn't have said anything. I feel that my ex is more upset about this than our breakup. He's not meant to talk to me about this but he does, and I'm starting to doubt if I should have done. I hoped by talking to them they would have supported him through it but they didn't.  I also didn't want them to hear my side second hand (we live in a small town and it was bound to get to them and be 10 times worse than what I said). 

So, was I the ah? I want to fix this if I am, he was also very good manipulating me and I'm worried he's done it again! ",6,1732956957.0,AmItheAsshole,22,0.8,False

1h38kzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h38kzc/aitah_for_calling_cps_on_my_sister/,AITAH for calling CPS on my sister ,"It's kind of a longer story so I'm gonna put bullet points too to help illustrate, for those who don't want to read the whole thing. I have a tendency to write super long posts - AITAH for calling CPS based on history and what I saw when I visited? CPS decided to open an investigation on my sister and her kids.

Twist:

She called the Police after she figured out what I had done. She told them I was a danger to my children and my stepchild (who lives with me and my husband) and was hurting them. She made particular mention of my step child and me. They had to visit to make a welfare check and talk to the kids alone.

The Police concluded they suspected it was malicious after talking to the kids and then me. I asked if it was my sister, and they said they aren't allowed to confirm or deny who it was, but they could tell me who it wasn't if I asked. (so I asked if it was any professionals involved with the kids, they said no. I asked if it was my husbands ex - they said no.) When I mentioned my sisters name, they fell silent and stared at me.

Here are my reasons for calling CPS:

* there are 4 kids

* a history of involvement with CPS from school referrals - usually due to concerns around neglect

* one kid has a long term health condition due to her smoking during pregnancy

* that same kid ended up in hospital for months with a respiratory illness because she smoked with him on her lap when he was newborn

* she has had a menagerie of animals in her home at different times all kept quite neglectfully - e.g 5 different dogs over the years, all randomly been rehomed and currently has 2 unruly dogs in her home. She was breeding guinea pigs in unsanitary conditions (algae filled water bottles, ammonia smell around the home due to them not being cleaned enough - at one point there were over 50 of them) I feel like this would be okay if she had space for them or cared for them properly

* one child runs away a lot - never leaves the area they live but he just leaves to get away from the house usually after a big fight

* I have personally seen her screaming at her kids when they want to spend time with her. one thing that stuck in my brain was when her 4 year old (at the time) was asking for a cuddle and she screamed down at her to ""f off and leave me alone"" 

* kids don't receive dental treatment ever and have problems

* they live in a grimy, smelly, smoke-filled house

* I called CPS after visiting and feeling shocked at what I saw/what my sister told me

* I also called kids schools to talk to them - and each school confirmed they had concerns about the kids
_______________________________________

This has been up and down for years but our Mom always used to help her a lot. She would go to my sisters house when she was losing her shit with her kids, and help find her runaway kid. We grew up in similar conditions so although she helped my sister to stop her getting out of control with her anger, she never saw an issue with how the kids lived. 

Our Mom passed away a little over a year ago, and since, there's been nobody who is supporting my sister.

She's always rejected support from me. I offered to visit more or her visit us. I suggested we take the kids out together. I suggested her and I meet for coffee regularly. She was just not bothered to.

I think this is because I've got 4 kids too, but keep my shit together. Not a perfect parent by any means, but clean house, spend time with my kids, etc etc

She said she doesn't want to visit my house with her kids because it's too hard to make her kids behave.

I've made suggestions when she's called me to tell me about the latest issue, but she never seems to want to do anything to improve things. E.G she said her oldest kid was driving her crazy and that everyone in the house hated him including her and her husband, so I suggested she start taking him out alone to grab a drink and just hang out without all the younger siblings, but she said she didn't want to.

Because her youngest kid has a lifelong illness, my sister devotes most of her attention giving to him, rather than the other kids.

It seems from how she treats them that she can't stand her older boy and younger girl, dotes on her younger boy, and makes her older girl do most of the household stuff/look after the younger girl.

The Older Boy (15):

* in trouble at school all the time.

* sets fire to things in his bedroom.

* beats up his oldest younger sister.

* was stealing food from a local store.

The Older Girl (12):

* worries about her Mom
* makes family dinner most nights


Last time I visited her, I saw a lock on the outside of older boys bedroom door. There were locks on all the food cupboards. There was grime, built up grime, on the kitchen counters and dried on food in the sink. Everything was covered in thick nicotine stains and dust. But she had randomly shampooed the carpet and sofa right before I arrived, even though it was planned I was visiting.

As we talked, she told me she has never taken the kids to see a dentist, and that her youngest has tooth pain and complains all the time. I asked why don't they take him she said cos they both hate dentists. (her and husband) She also said that she set up a camera in her kitchen to catch the kids ""stealing food"" at night from ""her cupboards"" 

Her kids are very very skinny.

It just all felt really wrong and really gross. Like I had to shower and wash all my clothes when I got home. 

And my house is NOT pristine at all. But I'm not a smoker.

If you read this far, congrats. I didn't feel good calling CPS. Before I gave them personal details I asked if these things would be a cause for concern and they said absolutely, yes.

Our grandparents and Aunt have told me that they think I'm full of hatred and can't understand why I did it. They said that all CPS do is cause trouble and break up families. They said that there is nothing wrong with what my sister does.

I feel like maybe they don't know everything. 

My grandmother and sister said that I have very poor mental health and this must be why I did it. My grandmother even called my husband to discuss my mental health, and tell him how awful she thought my behaviour was, and how disgusted my Mother would be if she was alive.",3,1732956892.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

now 10 days back again I had this indigestion, feeling of fullness after having whole cup of vanilla latte with regular milk - had taken pepto bismol at night and started feeling good next day morning. but from that day I feel continuous feeling of gas bubbling in my stomach - its like always someting is cooking up in my belly. my bowel movement is OK - couple of mornings i felt constipated , but almost every day I had bowel movement. Today morning I had omeprazole in the morning , after 45 mins I had a bowl of plain oatmeal (no milk), was feeling ok. then at time of lunch I had Indian Roti with Paneer (Cheese, milk based) and after 2 hour I had to go to Toilet and this time its all watery stool.

I‚Äôve tried everything. washing my face, drinking water, drinking coffee (which does work for a few hours, after which I just sleep), i‚Äôve even tried sleeping early, which doesn‚Äôt work and I end up waking up at the same time and being tired. honestly I envy morning people. Like imagine being able to get up in the morning and having the energy to go about your day without the constant need for a nap. must be nice. well now i‚Äôm stuck in my bed, writing this and probably not sleeping for a bit. I mean one time I slept at like 9 and woke up at 10 and I was still tired. 
in addition, they want me to just get up at like 7-8 to get everything done and stuff. like I get i can be more productive during the day, but i‚Äôm currently on thanksgiving break, so why can i just sleep some more. i already lose enough during school, so what‚Äôs the problem with regaining some hours. what‚Äôs the problem with being unproductive on thanksgiving BREAK. i‚Äôm done with college apps and im done with my homework and my responsibilities during the day. what‚Äôs wrong with staying up a bit more and sleeping a bit more. 
also my parents have something against spreading out work. like sure if I get it done early, i don‚Äôt have to worry about it the rest of the time. But also I could take 2-3 hours to do it now, or I could just do a bit across the break and idk relax on my break (crazy idea ik). 

TL:DR: i‚Äôm tired when I wake up and i‚Äôm not supposed to be tired when I wake up because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot good in the adult world‚Äù or something like that. and being unproductive during break is bad. and spreading out work is bad

1h38g74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lithopolis/comments/1h38g74/man_trying_to_attract_attention_in_front_of_das/,"Man Trying to Attract Attention In Front of ""Das KaffeeHaus Von Frau Burkhart?""","This may be an odd post, but I'm very curious about something I experienced in Lithopolis, Ohio on the evening of 11/29/2024, and I thought maybe a local could shed some light on it.

A family member and I were in the area to pick someone up for a visit. We had two hours until their arrival and so we looked for a coffee shop open late and found ""Das KaffeeHaus Von Frau Burkhart"" listed as being open until 9 PM. Our passenger was to arrive at 8, it was 6 PM when we arrived, and so we felt this was perfect.

Due to some parking confusion, we circled the block once. As we did, just in front of the coffee shop, a man holding what looked like a large poster or sheet made eye contact with me - surprising, since it was dark out (and it was about 28 degrees and he wasn't dressed especially warmly). He started waving at me emphatically, pointing to whatever he was holding, and pointing across the street. I looked and saw the Mexican restaurant El Pedregal (I'd eaten in another location before, so I recognized it and I assume it's a local chain).

When we circled the block and prepared to park next to the Remax office, we saw him still in front of the coffee shop. He wandered up near us and started casually looking at the logos on the Remax office window, no longer carrying the poster or sheet - it was clear he was trying to appear casual but was waiting to talk to us. We felt a bit creeped out. He sauntered back towards the coffee shop as we tried to decide if we wanted to get out or not. Just then a truck parked in front of us and some people got out and headed for the bar and grill in between the Remax and the coffee shop. He stopped them as they were just about to enter and he said a lot of very emphatic things that I couldn't understand from that distance, but the people said ""thank you"" and walked inside. He followed them and stayed inside for a minute or two, and then headed back to the area in front of the coffee shop.

At this point we decided to go ahead. As we walked towards the coffee shop, we saw that he was crossing the street. As we went inside, we saw him look back from across the street and say something loudly that ended with the words ""coffee shop,"" it sounded like he was angrily/in frustration saying ""they went into the COFFEE SHOP!""

I'm curious if any locals could tell me: is there a story behind this? We both assumed he was trying to convince passers-by to eat in El Pedregal, and that the thing he'd been holding was a flyer or a menu, and that maybe his comment as we walked into the coffee shop was to someone at the restaurant via a blu-tooth headset on his phone. But, we aren't sure.

I'm not a regular visitor to Lithopolis and this doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, but the whole experience was so singularly weird that I can't help but be curious. Is there some kind of story here? Do the businesses have a grudge against each other? Was he just trying to poach customers? Or was this something else entirely?",1,1732956299.0,Lithopolis,0,1.0,False

1h38cpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h38cpa/the_last_hour/,The Last Hour,"My hands shake as I write these words, knowing they might be my last. The countdown to my death has begun - don't ask me how I know this. I just do.

It echoes in my skull louder with each passing moment, and when I close my eyes, I hear it clearly: tick, tick, tick. A clock measuring out my final moments. This nightmare has devoured my days, driving me to acts I never thought myself capable of. The ticking never stops. Even now, it reverberates through my bones, growing louder with each passing second.

I screamed at Mom yesterday. She just brought soup, asked about dinner. ""Sweetheart, you're scaring me,"" she whispered. That look in her eyes... God, Mom, if you only knew how scared I am. Now I'm in my closet, shoved the dresser against the door. Stupid, right? trying to block death with this beaten-up dresser.

This all began a month ago, after the crash. They called it a miracle - the kind that makes you question if you're blessed or cursed. Five people died that day, their cars crumpled like paper around mine. Yet I stepped out without a scratch, not even a bruise. The paramedics kept checking and rechecking, convinced they'd missed something. That's when the ticking started. Just a whisper at first, so faint I thought it was tinnitus from the crash. The doctors agreed, said it was normal after trauma. Normal. There's nothing normal about hearing your own countdown.

In quiet moments, the ticking matches my heartbeat. At first, I thought it was just anxiety, stress from the accident making me hyper-aware of time passing. The doctors said it was expected - survivor's guilt, trauma response. Take these pills, they said. Get some rest. But pills might as well be candy, and silence has become my enemy.

I can't stand quiet places anymore. My desk at the office became unbearable - just me, my computer, and death's metronome. Now I work from crowded caf√©s, busy malls, anywhere with noise. My colleagues think I've become more sociable. The truth? I'm desperate for any sound that might drown out the ticking in my head. The baristas at Downtown Coffee know my order, always giving me the table near their loudest speaker. The music helps, sometimes. But even through the chaos of a hundred conversations, it's still there. Always there. Perfect clarity. Every step. Every breath. Every second.

That's when it began. Strange things. The birds came first, following my every move, staring with blank eyes that reflected only despair. Then came the accidents. Things that usually happen once in a while began happening daily. I slipped... why did I slip? The concrete was dry. Completely dry.

As if that wasn't enough, my eyes started failing me next. These eyes that never missed a thing, that could spot a quarter across the street - they began to betray me. Stepped right into traffic just days before. The car was right there. How did I not see it until I heard the horn?

My boss suggested vacation time. ""You look exhausted,"" she said. If only that was all it was. The time off only made things worse - too much quiet, too much time to notice how the ticking grew louder with each hour that passes. Thoughts I'd been avoiding began surfacing, but I was afraid to reach the obvious conclusion. Perhaps I already knew the answer, just couldn't bear to face it.

My denial didn't last long. But come Tuesday, another crash - a truck this time, swerving into my lane on the highway. Metal screamed, glass shattered everywhere, cars spun and flipped like they weighed nothing. The world turned upside down. Asphalt rushing at my face. Should've died. The paramedics said as much, staring at me like they'd seen a ghost. Three totaled cars. Not a scratch on me. Again.

That night, the ticking changed. Faster, more urgent, like a stopwatch counting down instead of a clock keeping time. I paced my apartment, trying to understand why death's metronome had chosen me. Why it was getting louder. Why it seemed to speed up with each brush with death.

Then came the rat. Just a shadow darting across my kitchen floor, seeking the hole in my wall. I didn't mean to kick it - just a startled reflex. The wet crack against the wall made bile rise in my throat. But when I closed my eyes, something was different. The ticking... softened. Just slightly, but after weeks of listening to it day and night, I noticed.

I found myself staring at the tiny corpse, a horrible thought forming. Was it coincidence? The way the sound dipped after something died? No. No, that was crazy thinking. Had to be. But the thought lingered, whispering possibilities I didn't want to hear.

I've been in this closet for... I don't even know anymore. Time's wrong in here. Hours vanish. Nothing makes sense anymore. The ticking's so loud now I can barely think. Can barely write. My hand keeps shaking.

It stopped. One last time, I closed my eyes and found silence - sweet, terrible silence. This isn't a story anymore, just my last words before... God, I can feel it now. If I'm wrong about all this, I'll laugh it off tomorrow. But if I'm right... Mom, I'm so sorry for every-

**POLICE INCIDENT REPORT**

**Report Number:** 2467  
**Date:** \[REDACTED\]  
**Location:** Apartment 4B, Cedar Heights Complex  
**Classification:** Death Investigation

**INITIAL FINDINGS**

* Body discovered in bedroom closet following neighbor complaints of odor

* Comprehensive autopsy ordered
* Structural analysis of closet space
* Clock mechanism analysis
* Canvass for additional witnesses

**Case Status:** OPEN - Investigation continues

When I use the assisted tamping system it needs approximately 20g of ground coffee to get the green light saying it is the right amount of coffee. I use a semi-assisted method where I use a dosing funnel, wdt and tap it before flattening with the assisted tamper in the machine.

This all works pretty well, but I also have a gravity distributor leveller tool (ikape) that doesnt really seem to work with this method.
The amount of coffee required to get a suitable dose effectively means it is sticking out over the top of the portafilter before it is tamped, so if I use the leveller the coffee sticking out goes everywhere. It is a nice tool but I cant see a way of using it cleanly.

I understand that 20g is a bit more than standard dosing, but my understanding is the amount required is based on the compactness and distance between the water spout and the top of the puck so that the correct pressure goes through the puck. So if I put less in this will be too big a gap and the pressure wont be correct.

However, even though I was on a fairly fine setting on the DF64 it still ran through my La Pavoni europiccola as if it was nothing (I am using 11.5g of beans). Up to a certain point I can't go to a finer grind setting without the grounds being stuck inside the grinding chamber (my theory is that the grounds are too fine and clumb together) even if I use the bellows aggressively, the only way out is to go to a coarser setting until the grounds exit the grinding chamber.

Has anybody else experienced this? I don't know what to do honestly. This is not some extremely out of the ordinary coffee

2. Prazosin - I don‚Äôt take it every day but I noticed just taking it every other day has helped. 

3. Not watching the news and cutting out any films that are gory (not that I ever tended to watch them anyway but pure no no) 

4. Figuring out what time I usually get my night terrors and setting an alarm right before then and then going back to bed.  
5. Going back into my memory of what things I may have repressed or didn‚Äôt deal with and talk through them with myself and how they could be connected to my dreams 

6. Getting a higher pillow/pillow with an incline (I have sinusitis so if I sleep flat I realize I can‚Äôt breathe well and the few times I caught my dreams I realized I was dreaming I was suffocating)

7. Lowering my stress levels - cut out toxic people, change your toxic job, get massages, stretch before bed, etc. 


 I‚Äôll add more if I remember. I definitely have more night terrors when my gut is upset or when I‚Äôm stressed.

Hi,

I‚Äôm a regular flat white drinker and have been using the Lelit Anna PL41TEM with PID for the past 2‚Äì3 years, paired with the Eureka Mignon Manuale grinder. These were my first machines, and they‚Äôve served me well.

Now, I‚Äôm moving to Asia, where the Lelit brand isn‚Äôt popular. Based on my research, Breville seems to be the most available option there.

Due to limited baggage space, I can only bring my grinder, so I‚Äôm considering a few Breville machines: the Bambino Plus, Dual Boiler, and Barista Pro.

I‚Äôm looking for a reasonable option‚Äînot too expensive but good enough to maintain the quality of coffee I‚Äôm used to.

What are your thoughts on these models?

Thanks in advance for your advice!

It could just be a hamster running endlessly on very good coffee and it wouldnt matter....
 
But lets look at the facts we know. 

- the Silo needs a power source that can work for hundreds of years
- there is almost no knowledge, no manuals, no technical literacy, beyond some word of mouth knowledge being passed down via shadows
- there is no maintainence or replacement of parts performerd for hundreds of years
- the giant turbine isn't the power source, its merely converting the real source (the steam) into electricity. 
- Mechanical rightly thinks they are vital, but they don't seem to wonder about the real source. This curiousity seems to have been bred out
- its not just 1 Silo, but many of them, all placed closely together, that need to be powered


There is no known source of power using fossil fuels or conventional means that satisfies these parameters. But consider nuclear power -

- nuclear plants generate power using..... steam turbines!
- the mechanisms shown of a source of hot steam, pressure release valves etc are exactly what would be needed
- you would need a large body of water to act as coolant exchange as well as reserve, which is exactly what each silo has
- its a self contained closed system that can work with zero input or even knowledge
- there has been a lot of focus on water, taps etc. I'm guessing radiation poisoning seeping into water could very well be a factor and the higher ups know about it
- A single reactor could easily power multiple silos and is the only power source feasible",1,1732954306.0,SiloSeries,3,0.56,False
