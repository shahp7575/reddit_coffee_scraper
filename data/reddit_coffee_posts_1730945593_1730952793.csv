Idk why I go through this but maybe because I’m out in public without a male protector so that makes me targeted hence why they’re bold? But yeah f*^ck them I hate white men at the pit of my soul.

Feedback is appreciated ,"Hey all. I originally posted this over at “AITAH”( am I the asshole) yesterday and finally got confirmation that this isn’t normal and it could be abuse. I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts from this particular subreddit. I am going to copy/paste from the post over there, and add new snippets of info here and there. 

“AITAH for trying to talk down my husband after his road rage” 

Today started off nice. My (43 f) husband (47 m) left work early and we planned to go vote together. He grabbed coffee for us on the way home, picked me up and then we voted.
While heading back, a car in front of us started turning really slowly, on the same street we were turning. He LAID on the horn, and with the windows open started screaming, “what the fuck are you doing! Go! Fucking go!”…the car was driving slow (and apparently swerving but I didn’t see that) and he then sped up, and cut in front of them on a no passing lane.
Five minutes went by and he was silent. 
I honestly had been horrified since the start of his outburst, when he was screaming and laying on the horn. I said to him, “so, there were two ways you can react to that type of…” and before I could finish he FREAKED OUT. He started saying, “oh you want to start? Are you seriously doing this?!?!” Then was irate and started screaming at me all the way home. 

Some context here: he has in the past acknowledged that he has anger issues. He has screamed at me in the past and freaks our dogs out. All I want when we DO fight is to talk to him in a calm manner but he just. Cannot. Do it. 

We get home and he is telling me I ruined his day. That things were great and I “was sticking up for the other driver”. Is that right? Am I the asshole here? 

EDITED TO ADD: an update of today’s events. I replied to some of your comments with this update, just wanted to throw it here as well. 

I wanted to give you an update (or lack of one lol) So today he blocked my number so I could not talk to him. I hate when he does that because I get so anxious knowing I cannot get a hold of him if it’s urgent. I went out to run errands when he got home. I work from home 3 days a week. Anyways. When I get back home he unblocks me. I go in the in guest bedroom to watch tv and I am pretty upset at this point, as I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong yet he somehow weaseled an apology out of me. So I text him, saying I work in the office tomorrow, and that I don’t know when I will be home, as what is the point if he is giving me the cold shoulder.

His reply? “You really betrayed me and to top it off I actually feel sick and had a migraine today between you and the news I got when I woke up.  Why should I ever make time for you? If I work that hard to make you happy and be helpful”

(*he is referring to grabbing coffee yesterday and picking me up to vote, and POSSIBLY this past weekend where he assembled some ikea office furniture for me- I repaid him in fancy homemade cocktails and his favorite dinner*)

“…and you defend some mouth-breather instead of someone you “love”. You really fucked up. The lesson I learned is not a good one”
______________________________

He has said a few things here and there but the big thing he keeps saying is that “I betrayed him”. I told him last night I was SO CONFUSED by the phrasing. To me, betrayal is like, Shakespearean tragedy…end of the world stuff. So I said, “it’s not like I grabbed 5 dudes of the street and fucked them in front of you, I just said to try responding to dumb drivers in a better way” he said “oh go ahead, do it!” Like HUH? Did he not get the point of my comparison and how ridiculous it sounds? 

I asked at one point, “so what, should I look for another place?” He replied first with a “if that’s what you want, SURE! What do you have here that you can bring with you? This is all my stuff.” This is true- most of the furniture is his from before the marriage. I said that I had a few rooms of furniture, but it does not matter. He said “what are you going to do, go live with your brother? What would you do???” I said again that it didn’t matter, but it was not something I WANTED to do, but in that moment I felt that he wanted that. 

I dunno. I know this is a lot, and thank you if you read this far. I have bad credit I am working on, and my car is co-signed by him. So if I ever WAS to leave, I would have no car and a very hard time finding somewhere to go. Have any of you been through something similar?

Here're some personal confessions of mine with questions at the end, split into two parts.

# 1. Finding people to talk to

(background) Initially, I hoped I could do without talking to people since I'm just a dev turned ""I want to have a product"" person. Quickly, I learned that most activities around selling stuff are strongly related to understanding the person on the other side (duh). After that, I've read The Mom Test & Deploy Empathy and have a generally good idea of what I want when interviewing customers. Sending those first interview request DMs took some courage, but now I'm keeping some cadence and evolving my approach.

The only problem is, people are not really responding to my requests for interviewing them (insert surprised pikachu). I've tried sending linkedin/reddit messages, with or without a calendly link, and with or without a cash incentive. For now, crickets.

What I will try next is:

* expand to members of Facebook groups (and some other communities specific to my case),
* generate more incentives (increasing the gift card value, sharing and writing articles that might be meaningful to this group),
* build a personal online presence so that people don't wonder completely wtf is this guy,
* go to in-person events with this group and make coffee requests.

**What do you think of my strategy?**

# 2. Committing to a market before validating a business idea

Having learned about the stair-step approach and idea validation from Startups for the Rest of Us, I thought the goal was to find people and talk to them as quickly as possible.

But to me it seems that to even get to the point of interviewing people for validating an idea, you need to commit to a market segment. Meaning, commit a solid amount of time understanding a single slice of the customer base (e.g. many times more than just 20 hours) and build some amount of material/online presence in that space.

**I wonder what others think about this, and does this reflect the first-time-founder experience of others?**

Lastly, the book Start Small Stay Small talks about warm niches where you know a person in an industry and they can be your jump-off point for ideas. I feel that the circles of people I know are not great targets for Saas products - **do you think I should maybe just dig more with the people that I already know?**",1,1730952228.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

These **Mini Chocolate and Raspberry Cakes** are perfect little indulgences that combine rich chocolate flavor with a hint of fruity raspberry in every bite! Layers of moist chocolate cake are topped with a luscious cream cheese raspberry frosting, making these treats as beautiful as they are delicious. Whether it’s for a special event or a cozy night in, these mini cakes will impress everyone!

# 🛒 Ingredients

# For the Cake

* Cooking spray, for greasing
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 cup brewed coffee (for extra richness)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

# For the Raspberry Frosting

* 4 Tbsp butter, softened
* 2 oz cream cheese, softened
* 2 cups powdered sugar (more if needed for thickening)
* 3 Tbsp raspberry jam
* Red food coloring (optional, for a pop of pink)

# 👩‍🍳 Instructions

# Step 1: Prepare the Cake

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper and grease with cooking spray.
2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, whisk together the coffee, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Add in the vegetable oil and sour cream, mixing until smooth.
4. **Combine and Fold in Chocolate Chips**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing just until incorporated. Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips.
5. **Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool completely.

# Step 2: Make the Raspberry Frosting

1. **Cream Butter and Cream Cheese**: In a medium bowl, beat together the softened butter and cream cheese until smooth and creamy.
2. **Add Powdered Sugar and Jam**: Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating until smooth. Mix in the raspberry jam. Depending on the consistency of your jam, you may need to add a bit more powdered sugar to make the frosting stiff enough to hold its shape.
3. **Optional Coloring**: For a decorative touch, divide the frosting in half and add a few drops of red food coloring to one half to create a pink shade. Transfer each color to piping bags with your desired tips.

# Step 3: Assemble the Mini Cakes

1. **Cut Out Cake Circles**: Once the cake has cooled, turn it onto a cutting board. Use a 3.5-inch round cookie cutter to cut out 3 circles.
2. **Layer and Frost**: Place one layer on a small plate or serving platter. Pipe a layer of frosting on top of the cake circle, alternating colors if desired. Gently stack the second layer on top and repeat. Finish with the final cake layer and decorate the top with your chosen frosting design.

These mini cakes are ready to serve! They’re adorable, decadent, and a delightful treat for any occasion.

","About 6 months ago I became dizzy (rocking/swaying) out of the blue and pretty much been dizzy almost daily since.  About 1 day a week or so I  feel normal or near normal.  

I rattled around the medical system for a while, saw my PCP doc and 3 specialists.  Had a bevy of tests before finally getting a diagnosis of PPPD with possible VM (I don't present with typical VM symptoms, but Doc didn't rule it out because of the presentation of my PPPD).  

Began taking Effexor at super low dose (12.5mg) with a slow ramp up. 

Dizziness is still there, but had a few more normal-ish days than over the last month and the intensity of the dizziness is notably less.  

I'll be honest, the Effexor has taken some adjustment, the primary issue is feeling quite jittery, like I had two too many cups of coffee.  So I'm glad to take it slow. 

Since it seems to be going in the right direction, I'm happy to keep going.  Just curious for those who are on it, how long before you saw significant reduction of dizziness and at what dose?",1,1730951867.0,VestibularMigraines,1,1.0,False

It is very creamy. It makes an excellent substitute for cream and even tastes better. You can buy one with a sweetener added, which is a bonus for some. This company also has one of the best oat milk varieties.

**Yves Salami**

  

https://preview.redd.it/hhboy0cjhezd1.jpg?width=206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=083e42704267987efcc992d00873d9a62e5c8b00

This plant-based salami is practically indistinguishable from meat salami. Its texture is excellent, and its seasonings taste the EXACT same. Plus, since it doesn't come from a factory farm, it's 100% better. This one really exceeded my expectations, and I wouldn't expect anything more from it, considering it's one of the more affordable plant-based options as well.

**Yves Turkey**

 

https://preview.redd.it/mwkao0gkhezd1.jpg?width=206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bfcd09cf19c24244bd01547650847dd5cca8d06

This turkey could easily fool someone. It has an excellent texture, excellent smoked flavour, and great seasoning. Some people may be able to taste the difference. However, it's a better product than real meat, considering it tastes just about the exact same and provides a healthier source of protein.

**Yves Ham**

 

https://preview.redd.it/aj10r69mhezd1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8411605308fd1a0c582c922904a8d9ba20b4efc6

This ham is quite good. It has a great texture. It even looks like a marbled deli slice and has that same smoky flavour. Although it is good, I wouldn't say I like it as much as the salami or the turkey, and I suspect there could be better hams on the market. However, when I tried this on pizza, it tasted just like a meat pizza. It could be worth a try, considering some people's taste buds are different.

**Silk Pumpkin Spice Coffee Creamer**

 

https://preview.redd.it/us0qsp4ohezd1.jpg?width=221&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8663c0df6bd757e46a51ebbd413a22113e08ca2

This one had a good flavour and would make an easy substitute for the flavoured dairy creamers we often find in the supermarkets. It could easily fool someone.

**Gusta Pepperoni**

 

https://preview.redd.it/bhapm10phezd1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=286cec90c5a7766f29745453d829d7d104ec3041

This pepperoni is quite good and has an excellent texture and flavour. It could easily fool someone as real pepperoni. It chews just like meat and has all the same seasonings. That being said, it might taste slightly better if they made it more spicy.

**Gusta Fish Free Tuna**

 

https://preview.redd.it/rap6k8aqhezd1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ace550e94682aa13fae265609a02a50ca13b613

I have nothing but good things to say about this tuna. I made a tuna salad, and I am sure that nearly everyone would think it's real tuna. Plus, it's a no-brainer, considering tuna are overfished, contain more toxins, and are way less environmentally friendly.

**Gusta Beef**

 

https://preview.redd.it/rcg0ik0shezd1.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=020aad15342cf7d3a373fb8f51eea96848b8a1f7

This product has a unique beef flavour. It's different from beef, but this recipe brings something different that the other beef substitutes miss. The texture isn't terrible, and it tasted good on a meat lover's pizza I made from vegan meat alternatives. It could be worth a try.

**Beyond Meat Chicken Nuggets**

 

https://preview.redd.it/h76pmwzshezd1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bff1870de0cf1946cd82228e7e970dd09b668b26

These are easily the closest thing to a real chicken nugget I've tasted. People would have absolutely no problem at all fooling me with these. The spice recipe is identical to chicken strips I've had in the past, so it awakens this nostalgic feeling. It has practically the same protein content as a chicken strip and is all-around healthier, except for the fact that it has more salt than a typical chicken strip.

**Beyond Meat Steak**

 

https://preview.redd.it/8p84xwauhezd1.jpg?width=224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9c0efbba088f819286b6d8e566bfd37a5956805

This product is quite good and has an exceptional texture. It's the closest one I've tried to steak. My only complaint is that it's somewhat salty, which impedes one's ability to add spices and salt rubs. There's also not very much in the package, and it's more expensive than I would like. Nevertheless, it's the best beef substitute to fool someone with. It would taste good if people cold-smoked these steak bites as they would bring a new flavour into it that could further trick someone into thinking it's beef.

**Beyond Beef and Beyond Burger**

   

https://preview.redd.it/obtlehrvhezd1.jpg?width=229&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75741482c26e070241014c572ffe9b5e5f97db3e

I think Beyond Beef is one of the best, if not the best, burgers I've tried on the market. I do get that feeling sometimes that it could be better if it combined some of the elements of the other burgers, such as the Impossible Burger, but it has what it takes to help people transition. I really like frying it up in a ginger garlic recipe like this:

**Yves Mediterranean Harissa Veggie Sausages**

These are by far the best sausages I've tried by Yves. The texture is excellent; just about anybody could think it's real meat in a sauce. The flavour is also amazing. It tastes great in pasta with tomato sauce.

**O' Doughs Bakery Garlic and Chive Vegan O'Dippers**

 

https://preview.redd.it/9ud9xf50iezd1.jpg?width=224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a49b1f9a36f597210fc047fe532bae16720ae412

These tasted good with Boursin's Garlic and Herb Dairy Free Spread. They taste delicious right out of the oven.

This spread tasted really good. People would like it better than a dairy dip. It had me coming back to the fridge several times.

**Noble Jerky**

 

https://preview.redd.it/o5uoy1j4iezd1.jpg?width=213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6181c5597f521e48f46d67cd30cbb217b2d2bcac

These jerkies are quite good. They have the same texture as jerky, and once again, you could fool someone with them. Plus, considering no animals are harmed, it's clearly a noble choice.

**Field Roast Chef's Signature Plant-Based Burger**

 

https://preview.redd.it/y553nsx6iezd1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bd054c51a2c06425a749544fc50af8af9c64eb5

This burger is quite good. What I like about it is that it's not necessarily trying to be a beef burger. Burgers like this tend to be healthier and bring a whole new flavour, which I appreciate. Its texture is good, and so is its flavour. I definitely would repurchase this.

**President's Choice Corn Kale Carrot Peas Veggie Burger**

 

https://preview.redd.it/zcjnm388iezd1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=111add1f29d0e3277bc5d236e86520ddbbc1eb58

This burger is quite good and has a great texture. It's not trying to be a beef burger but has a great flavour. You'd be amazed at how good it is.

**President's Choice Chickpea and Sweet Potato Veggie Burger**

 

https://preview.redd.it/2txqlyb9iezd1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55a7132634c5d80347fc3225c4d8aa73e8e6e3cb

This burger also has a very great texture and flavour. These burgers might seem weird to some, but they would find them quite tasty if they were raised differently. There's something about plant-based meat alternatives that seems cleaner or more refreshing. It must be the fact that they're healthier due to not having as much saturated fat and cholesterol. 

**Impossible Plant-Based Chicken Nuggets**

https://preview.redd.it/hurv8xqaiezd1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef43a54b45a75e74d0431133333bc845d50f1371

These chicken nuggets are delicious. They could fool people. Great texture and great flavour. I recommend these for those struggling to transition. I think Beyond Meat's Chicken tenders are a bit tastier; however, these are definitely worth it, and I think they're typically a bit cheaper.

1glhpwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1glhpwu/fn_how_to_slay_your_siren/,[FN] How to Slay Your Siren,"It was August when we first met. Do you remember?

Time has spun into a skein since then, and perhaps with distance the line between fiction and reality has blurred. But I’ve always thought that was just you. You were particularly fearless back then, weren’t you? Not a care for consequence.

And so my memory of that day is a patchwork, set out and displayed in contrasts.

My eyes remember that the sunset painted everything in the palette of a fire, pulling jewel tones from mundanity, transforming even the drabbest hues. Pink and orange and red glinting off a deep, sapphire sea. Topaz sand, glittering underfoot. The sky, still holding onto a lapis blue.

_It was warm,_ something in the jewel-tone sky, the glittering sea tries to insist. _One of those perfectly warm, perfectly clear August days that caresses your skin and lingers into evening like a kiss._

But something yet deeper remembers elsewise. In the depths of my mind are flashes of gooseflesh, hairs standing at attention as the relentless sea breeze picks up and sends any exposed bit of skin into fits of prickles. Something remembers the tactile _squish_ of wet socks in sodden sneakers that had never gotten the chance to properly dry after being caught in a sudden downpour that afternoon.

I hated you for that at the time. Hated you for the fact that I couldn’t even remember the weather properly, hated that you’d messed with my head just by _being_ there.

Hated you for making me doubt myself.

Hated you for being so beautiful that you made me wonder if it was _me_ who edited my memories into their most perfect incarnations.

But now, none of that matters. It doesn’t matter if it was a perfect end to a perfect day or if I was crossly wandering the beach with sodden, squelching shoes.

Because at the end of it all, at the end of that sunset, as the lip of the sea slowly began to swallow up the scattered leavings of low tide, was *you*. Washed ashore in a tangle of seaweed and driftwood, blood matting salt-snarled hair around a gaping wound. Precariously balanced in the jaws of the sea.

Eyes like the lure of an anglerfish met mine.

_”Help me,”_ you begged. _“Help me.”_

I’ve always known you for what you were, even back then. How could I not, when the same tide that brought you was filled with torn and broken feathers, when the wings you’d illused into nothingness seeped more blood than the rest of your visible injuries combined?

How could I not, when merely a glance and two words made me instinctually want to overturn the world for you?

You must have known me for what I was, too. Your kind always says that my folk deal with so much killing that it seeps into our skin and we can’t help but smell of blood. I smell of blood too. I’ve been told that it clings to me, wafting like an iron-scented shroud, undeniably announcing the reaper’s presence. You couldn’t _not_ notice. Even if, *somehow*, you were too injured, too close to the cliff of consciousness at the sea’s edge to catch that peculiar, acrid tang at the back of your throat, you _certainly_ noticed it when you woke up in my bed the next day—clean and bandaged—and rode a brief swell of surprise before smiling and pretending you’d merely been caught up in a boating accident.

Don’t hate yourself too much for lying, okay? It’s not really deception if you’re the only one who thinks you’re hidden. Besides, you were right to do it. You were you and I was me, and the only reasonable answer for why you were still alive in front of me—*me*, one smelling so strongly of blood I ought to be dripping with it—would be my ignorance.

If anything, I was more surprised than you when I found that I hadn’t killed you, that evening on the beach. I wanted to. When your eyes first sank shut and the unconscious compulsion you’d been seeping slipped, the ever-present bloodlust rushed forth in a geyser to replace enthralled fascination.

But I was curious. Curious enough to temporarily pack away my need to sink a knife into your heart.

It’s not every day that a monster asks their hunter for help.

Of the two of us, I sometimes wonder which one is really the monster.

I didn’t wonder then, but I do now. Your folk can put away your feathers and your fangs, can sheath your claws and glamor yourself into normalcy. After all, how could _you_ be the monster, when you treated me to dinner for saving you, even knowing what I am? When your smile wasn’t even forced, when you turned your charm back until you were nothing more than a slightly likable person, when I felt the rush of air as an invisible and most certainly still-injured wing flared out to fend off the splashing puddle of a passing car? Yes, how could someone like _that_ be the monster?

You and yours will always be beautiful and dangerous. But like a knife, the danger is in the choosing.

A knife can just as easily be used to carve art as shred flesh.

But I and my kind are like cats. There is nothing about us on the outside to suggest that we are a danger. We are well-fed and lazy, and there is no reason for us to hunt. Then someone like _you_ crosses our path. A hapless bird, perfectly in reach.

It’s more instinct than choosing. It’s the rush of blood at the sight of fluttering feathers, the need to wait and watch and stalk. The need to leap out at the last second, curving claws and teeth ready to tear. It is the thrill of the hunt, the pounce, the _game._

There is no _choosing_ in the danger I pose. Cats do not make friends with birds.

I thought of our acquaintance as a game, too. A strange play, to see how long you could keep pretending. To see if I could secretly uncover what brought you to your knees at the edge of the sea, a place that should have been your domain, where _nothing_ ought to be as powerful as you.

And then when the game was up, I would simply catch the bird as instinct demanded.

But you drank cocoa and couldn’t stand the bitter taste of coffee. You liked science fiction and made weekly trips to the library and never stopped painting the ever-changing canvas of the sea.

I played my game and our meetings continued and you kept walking into my life willingly. Willingly! So seemingly oblivious to the danger at your door. You _had_ to have known, but why? Why would you come closer to the monster who cared nothing for your life and had all but planned your death?

Yet, you _did_ come closer, walking into my life and shedding downy feathers to make a nest around my heart.

It confused me. _You_ confused me. But I didn’t want to consider it, didn’t want to pry it apart and understand it, so I left it be. Kept playing the game I’d started and no longer quite knew how to finish.

I just didn’t expect my game to end so soon. Tendrils of the truth were beginning to show past the front you’d put up. Your community wasn’t as united as I’d thought. There were, of course, those like you, who hid their wings and crammed clawed feet into shoes every day in order to take advantage of everything that humans have built. There were those like you who only wanted to dance in the sea.

And there were those who thought that anyone who hid what they truly were was an affront. Thought that anything that prevented complete authenticity was worse.

They’d tried to kill you, that perfect, terrible August eve on the beach. Would have succeeded, had you not met me.

The game was up. I’d found my answer. But when I turned to the next step, the kill I’d wanted to make all along, that deed I had barely kept myself from doing for the first part of our acquaintance?

I didn’t want to anymore. Your rustling feathers, perfectly in reach, didn’t spur the same rush of blood to my head, didn’t spark the thrill of the hunt. The bloodlust had died and fondness had sprouted in its place.

Somehow the cat had made friends with a bird.

But what next? The game was over, but I didn’t want to leave you behind. Should I fess up? Should I admit that I knew what you were, had always known? Or should I just let it—whatever this relationship was—continue as it had, never waking up from the dream? I thought I’d have more time to think, thought I could work out my conundrum and take as long as I needed.

But they tried to kill you again.

Tried to kill me.

They came for us as we sat on the beach on another after-rain summer evening, erupting from the waves in a fury of feathers and claws and fangs.

Why did you shield me?

You knew what I was, knew from my bloody scent that I’d killed creatures far worse, far more terrifying than them. You could have let them by, and I would have easily dodged and fought them off in a heartbeat.

But you didn’t.

You hugged me and silently turned your back to the screeches, the slashing, crashing claws, and I couldn’t do anything.

Couldn’t do anything but freeze in shock as your blood soaked my shirt and you fell away from me. Falling, still smiling.

Maybe you didn’t want to wake up from the dream, either.

The bloodlust reignited, but it was different this time. Hotter. Angrier. Like the roaring of a barely-contained furnace.

I killed them. Killed them just like I’d always done before I met you.

But why do I feel like this? Why did their deaths bring only emptiness, why was it that I no longer cared as they stopped moving and my vision filled with you?

Why was it that I only knew my answer to my question as I held your bleeding body and listened to the breath still flowing in your lungs, felt the faint but clear pulse at your wrist?

Back then, I thought your life—your heart—was mine for the taking, that my knife could dart in, could easily end you at any time.

In the end it was you that took mine.

Please. Won’t you open your eyes again?

I can’t bear to watch my bird fly away.

When a (secret) book is pulled, it will cause a secret, round compartment to rise out of the center displaying whatever the owner wants. 

We have about 4 weeks to complete the project and 5 people total in our team.

We plan to use a mechanism like this car jack to raise the center piece: The motor will be attached to one end (somehow). 3D printed jack to save costs with a purchased screw rod and nuts.

The book will most likely pull a string that will press a lever and press a button/complete a circuit. (Feedback/ideas requested!)

The center compartment will use 2 drawer tracks taken from the table we are buying from FB marketplace to keep everything aligned.

Here's a preliminary sketch of the table (ignore the scissor lift):

**Feedback Requested:**

Should we use an Arduino or just a simple circuit? We're hoping to connect to a wall outlet...

Should we use a different lifting mechanism than the one described?

General feedback on the UX of the project would also be appreciated.

It started when I woke up feeling stuffy, a low grade fever, and sore throat one morning. I never broke out into a full grade fever and felt fine within the same day, but the cough has remained. It’s usually worse in the mornings and doesn’t disrupt my sleep at all. I’ve been to many doctors and I’ve been prescribed antibiotics, antihistamines, steroid nasal sprays, antitussives, expectorants, 3 days of omeprazole, and nothing has really made a difference. I also got a chest X-ray which was clear. 

I went to the ENT and she didn’t see anything weird with my throat, but I’m wondering if it could still be GERD/silent reflux based on my phlegm? Has anyone had mostly clear phlegm with yellow spots? I’m at a loss. I’m healthy otherwise and don’t drink coffee or consume all that much dairy (rarely).

The ENT ordered a sputum test which I’m waiting results for and 40mg omeprazole for 30 days as a trial. I’m a bit reluctant to get on omeprazole since I don’t have any symptoms but a cough.

I actually took the same antibiotics this month for 15 days and got so much worse that I now have classic reflux symptoms and have to be on pantoprazole until I heal. 
The thing I'm confused about is the tongue tingling/burning. Like I'm having actual reflux now that I can taste, but it doesn't make my tongue tingle except for when I tried a tums pineapple flavor chewable and it burnt my tongue. But during the year things like potatoes/sweet potatoes made my tongue tingle, and things like toothpaste, blueberries, and tofu made my tongue tingle immediately, then burn and stayed burnt (like from hot coffee) for weeks until it healed. I can't tell if the tingling and burning is instant because my tongue is injured from reflux and these things are just acidic and scratchy and irritating, or if there's something else going on making my tongue sensitive. My ENT was annoyed I wasn't tested for other causes of tongue tingling, but the reflux does make sense. Idk I guess I'm just seeing if anyone related bc I'm confused! I don't see how potatoes/sweet potatoes could be a reflux trigger unless it's bc my diet is so high in carbs right now. ",1,1730951517.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1glhnuz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glhnuz,gangstalker genesis,"no matter what you are told, led to believe, convinced off by endless threads of misinformation and propaganda… you will soon learn that true and only culprits behind this are the church. now before anybody gets too excited here… let me first state that I believe that faith in any form is faith worth having. I am not in any way against the church. I am just someone who is a victim to its organized methodologies. 

he was a little bit of information, I am from the Detroit area, and Detroit is home too many beautiful Gothic structures. French architects were behind the majority of not all of their artistry that still stands today. Amongst all of those beautiful establishments are the churches that line every corner of the historic Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit. Built within those structures of the churches or radio towers. In fact, every church is specifically equipped with its own radio tower right there front and center and you would never even know it.  Many would say that these radio towers were used by ham operators during emergencies. But there is a difference of opinion regarding their true purpose. 

an evangelical is somebody who is known as a faith healer.  Wearing rings sometimes on all fingers just like the pope. Those are actually for is to house a microchip that that radio tower built into the structure of the facility or church that they're in,  will follow with a pinpoint colonized precision. When that evangelical pushes towards you with the healing power of the Lord. A burst of radio frequency will force itself in the direction of the ring, and where it is seemingly directing its power to. 
that RF radiation is often times enough to make an individual feel dizzy or nauseous, which could appear as though they are anchoring the demon that is inside of this individual.  Radio frequency also has the ability in many ways to be medicinal as it can also shatter the cancer cell right out of the human body. It can force somebody up that is usually incapable of walking to a direction of wobbled yet standing surprise. He can also famously knocking individual clear off their feet 

churches used to be known as a place where people would go to heal from all different varieties of ailments . But it wasn't necessarily the priest doing the healing through God. But rather radio frequency, radiation zapping away the cells in the body that were that of a virus or an infection and even cancer.  This was the whole man behind the curtain experience that they wanted to sell people to encourage them to come to their house of worship. Often times churches would compete with the amount of radio frequencies used, which would sometimes leave their entire congregation feeling sick and unable to get up to leave. Radio frequency radiation also is known to heat up an individual causing them to sweat profusely. 

you see, the corporation spirit is undoubtedly something that effects all walks. from the weekly church goer to the freelance tarot reader. it's all man explaining to man that they know god as a man and that man said on to that man that the next man you see must be the man to hear gods word through your mouth on to his ears.  thusly creating the king james edition of the bible. speaking the word or god the way king james wanted us to understand it. that seems historical but let's fast forward slightly into the future. 

weaponizing faith and wars fought over dogma are in my opinion the best way to shed blood the fastest. hence ""undying devotion to a vocation"". that's all fine unless you consider it all being one man saying on to another man that their god is mightier so naturally blood must be shed. in the end they were both atheists because saying anyones god isn't real or doesn't exist is in fact the definition or atheism.  just because you belive in yours doesn't mean someone else can't experience god whatever way god wants itself to be experienced.  
 
which brings me to our current time line.. one saturated in evangelicals in the white house, turning coffee into wine... and fraternal orders of the catholic church handing out tootsie rolls and judgements on individuals chosen at random. individuals who are struck with an unforgiving amount of radiation and harassments via ""the voice of god weapon"". all of this to covertly have what we know as masons, rake it in as a collective of faith on non faith stalker action data broking. at your expense. 

if you're wondering where this is going, to hell with you. i'm kidding hell won't have you... but it might convince you otherwise in a series of psyops drenched manipulative broadcasted attacks via ham radios and amateur radio frequencies. that i know. good thing you were talked into dental hygiene at an early age because the pay off is some dude telling you that you have a cavity when you don't. all to drill a hole into a molar (upper right side) and fill it with an amalgam, an rfid chip and the hopes that you never discover either.  no worries though, a satellite found it for you. now you're officially gangstalked.

everything you're experiencing is broadcasted attacks from radio towers being used by a masquerades templar or men pretending to care.  franchising out torture software to their own groups much like the vatican and all their trustworthy ways. all i'm saying is i'm getting in that guilder library one or another and if that means fighting reptilians to do so, at least i know i have the actuality of god on my side.

Got back together, he said he learned a lot and was ready to put in the work, over the last year I have come to realize he is a huge liar, manipulative, a narcissist, abusive, selfish, porn addict, emotionally cheated (perhaps did physically as well who knows at this point)-I tried so hard to be patient, came to a point where I couldn’t even be sober around him any longer and I became a person I didn’t even recognize.

Putting this out here because I need to let it go somewhere. I’m not even sure if I’m making a big deal out of this, but every day I feel a bit more lost and disconnected. I do my best to stay grounded and focus on what brings me peace, but lately, I end each day feeling empty and like I’ve lost my heart somewhere in the past.

So, here’s a bit about me: I’m 26, single, was an engineer, but I co-founded a media company and now I’m building another business. Financially, I’m doing alright. I hit the gym, love to cook, and I know how to make someone feel comfortable talking to me. I’m not a player, I just enjoy meaningful connections. I’ve been told I have a way with women and I get my fair share of interest, but none of that matters when you’re feeling genuinely alone.

Aisha was my last serious girlfriend. We met on a dating app and were friends for a year before anything romantic started. She was the first to say ""I love you,"" and for a while, it was great. We shared similar interests, and for a while, it felt magical. But looking back now, I can see I got way too wrapped up in it. I didn’t set any boundaries and ended up pouring way too much into the relationship.

The little things started to add up. When I posted cute stories of us, she’d avoid sharing them, saying she didn’t want to ""jinx"" it. That stung, but I brushed it off. Then came bigger red flags. I learned she was still talking to her ex, saying it was ""just hugs and kisses,"" like that was totally normal. She kept his pictures on her Instagram and even met up with him when he was back from the US. She said they were ""just friends,"" but to me, it was a gut punch. We fought about it, and I told her I wasn’t okay with it. I’m all for friendships, but I don’t believe in staying best buddies with exes, and she didn’t see it my way.

The lies crept in. Once, she went for coffee with another guy she’d seen before me, only giving me a 30-minute heads-up. I was hurt and jealous because I’d been putting so much effort into helping her with her business ideas, brainstorming and planning for her. She said she was just networking, but it felt off. She’d told me she was just meeting him ""quickly, in a kurti,"" but then I saw her Instagram stories where she’d gone home first, dressed up, and then met him. I confronted her, and she finally admitted she’d lied—she even swore on her mom, which felt like a slap in the face. After that, it became hard to trust her.

Now, this wasn’t my first rodeo. Before Aisha, I dated a girl I’ll call Ayushi. We had some intense chemistry, but she came with constant drama, mainly around her ""guy best friend,"" who always seemed to be hovering around. Eventually, the relationship just wore me down mentally, so I ended it. But after things started to go south with Aisha, I found myself reaching out to Ayushi just to feel wanted. We exchanged some steamy texts (which I regret now), but it was like filling an emotional void.

Things really hit the fan when Ayushi found out about Aisha and sent her a message spilling everything. She even called my parents, making up lies and saying I’d led her on with marriage promises. It was a mental rollercoaster. Aisha forgave me eventually but admitted she hadn’t been treating me right either. But after a short period of forgiveness, she drifted back to her old habits. I stuck around as long as I could, but I was losing myself, piece by piece.

I did everything for her. I treated her family like my own—brought her mom flowers, looked out for her sister, and even her friends told me I was the best boyfriend she’d ever had. I kept a list of her likes and dislikes, tracked her cycles, tried to make her feel special any way I could. But looking back, I see that I lost a part of myself by not standing up for my own needs. I felt more like a caretaker than an equal partner.

After we finally broke up, Aisha begged for months, but I was done. I realized I’d given so much of myself that I didn’t have anything left. It’s been a year now, and she still checks my stories daily, which just feels weird.

But here’s where I’m stuck. I want to move on, but I feel emotionally numb and far from being able to love again. I’d be lying if I said my physical drive hasn’t faded a bit too. I tried hooking up with a friend, but it just didn’t feel right, and I’ve been spending too much time on Reddit late at night. I guess I’m filling the void somehow, but I’m not sure it’s the best approach.

I’ve thrown myself into work and self-improvement, which has helped me stay sane. But emotionally? I’m still lost. If anyone’s got any advice on how to rebuild after something like this, I’d love to hear it. And if you’ve got thoughts on how I handled things, I’m open to feedback too. I just want to grow and, eventually, find a way to love again—without losing myself in the process.

We were together for about six months, and we never discussed his W. I never wanted to, because I wasn’t interested in being part of a LTA. I was in love and happy, but also constantly guilt-ridden, and that was no way for me to live. I tried to end things several times, but he was so kind and gentle with me, and he fought hard for me to stay, so I did.

He hinted at the possibility of marriage between us (in my country, polygamy is legal). While I wanted to be with him, the challenges of navigating our families, religion, and cultures -especially since we're from different tribes which generally discourage intermarriage- would have been a nightmare.

When things ended earlier this year, I was in the middle of moving to a new home, and I was having a really hard time. While I understood he was struggling with a demanding boss, I felt that he wasn’t there for me when I needed him. I realized I deserved more—someone who could be there for me in difficult times. I didn’t want to go through challenges alone.

During the first NC period, I struggled to move on, constantly feeling disappointed and crushed by the situation. However, when we met up last month for coffee, we had a pleasant time. He asked to see me again soon, and I agreed, but he never reached out after that. I realized I was only going to get breadcrumbs from MM and think that finally gave me the strength I needed to move on.

I don’t regret getting involved with him— I honestly feel it was inevitable . And he taught me that I am lovable and worth the effort. He fought for me, reassured me and made me feel safe. He always felt like home. I never experienced that in previous relationships.

But ultimately, I want so much more than he can offer. I think I’m finally ready to move forward without thinking back on what could've been.",6,1730950711.0,theotherwoman,2,1.0,False

1glhd4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/1glhd4z/does_moving_through_time_create_energy/,Does Moving Through Time Create Energy?,"When we think about time, it usually feels like something that just flows around us — a constant river we all travel along. But what if time isn’t just a passive dimension? What if, by moving through it, all the matter in the universe is actually generating a tiny bit of energy? Imagine time as a sort of cosmic “road,” and all matter as cars moving forward on that road. If there’s friction on a real road, it produces heat — so could the movement of matter through time also create subtle energy effects?

1. Time’s One-Way Street: The Arrow of Time

In the world around us, we experience time in one direction only: forward. You pour milk into coffee, and it mixes, but it doesn’t unmix. This forward direction is often called the “arrow of time.” Scientists say it’s tied to entropy, or the tendency for things to go from order to disorder. Just as a clock only ticks forward, so does the universe — and everything in it, from atoms to stars, follows this forward flow of time.

2. Time and Friction: Could Moving Through Time Create Energy?

Now, here’s where things get interesting. In our everyday world, moving through a medium creates energy through friction. Imagine a meteor entering Earth’s atmosphere — it heats up and burns because of friction with the air. Or think about the heat created when you rub your hands together. What if moving through time creates a similar effect, just much smaller?

Could the act of matter moving forward in time create a faint, almost undetectable form of energy? This idea might seem out there, but it’s not so different from other ideas in physics that connect movement with energy.

3. Examples of How Matter and Time Already Interact

Time isn’t entirely separate from matter; in fact, they interact in fascinating ways:

Gravity and Time: Gravity doesn’t just pull things down; it actually affects time itself. Around massive objects like black holes, time moves slower. This means that matter and time are already interacting in ways we can observe. It’s a bit like a heavy rock causing a dip in a trampoline; the weight bends the surface and affects everything around it.

Quantum Fluctuations in “Empty” Space: At tiny scales, even “empty” space isn’t truly empty; it’s filled with fluctuations and energy blips. Scientists call this zero-point energy, and it’s a reminder that the universe is full of interactions happening at a level we don’t normally see. If time itself has any active role, it might interact with matter in ways that create faint energy at a similarly small scale.


4. The Hypothesis: Time as an Active Force

This brings us to the big idea: if time isn’t just a passive backdrop but something matter actively “moves” through, it could have a small but real impact. Imagine every atom, every particle, every galaxy experiencing a slight “drag” as it moves through time. This drag could create an almost invisible energy field. We might think of it as a background hum, produced simply by the forward journey of everything in the universe through time.

5. What Could This Mean for Our Understanding of the Universe?

Although this is a new way to think about time, it touches on some of the big questions science is trying to answer. We don’t know what exactly drives the universe’s expansion, nor do we fully understand the subtle “background” energies like dark energy that seem to affect space itself. Could some faint, time-related energy play a part?

Conclusion:

While this idea is just a thought experiment, it invites us to rethink time as more than a clock ticking forward. What if time itself, in some hidden way, contributes to the energy in the universe? By seeing time as an active force rather than a passive one, we may open the door to new ways of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe — and our place within it.


I did get chat gpt help me write this out, but this is basically my hypothesis and why I believe matters forward movement through time has a small but not insignificant energy effect on the universe. 

I'm a business man, not an expert, but I have never heard anyone talk about it. I would love to hear some real opinions if you are willing to give me your time.

Hello, fellow adventurers! Derek here, also known as u/solopassions, sharing a slice of my travel diary straight from the heartland of charm and elegance: Quebec City. Ever imagined jumping back in time while exploring a place that exudes history and French flair? Let me be your virtual guide on this solo escapade!

**The Unique Thrill of Solo Exploring 🏰**

Picture this: wandering the cobblestone streets of Old Quebec, where every corner is brimming with the sweet whispers of history. As a solo traveler, the sensation is as authentic as the maple syrup that glazes their irresistible desserts! Seriously, ever experienced *poutine* without a partner-in-crime to binge with? It’s a challenge and a triumph rolled into one crispy, cheesy, gravy-dripping bite. 😋

Being on my lonesome, I got to pause and soak in every intricate detail of the Notre-Dame de Québec Basilica-Cathedral and capture impromptu selfies against the backdrop of the majestic Château Frontenac — because who else understands my best angles? #SoloSelfieSkills

**Personal Growth Courtesy of Quebec City 🌟**

Traveling solo in Quebec City transformed me into a braver, more introspective version of myself. There’s something beautifully liberating about not having an itinerary dictated by anyone else’s schedule. That freedom led me to spontaneous museum visits and unplanned coffee dates at cozy sidewalk cafes with locals eager to swap stories. Through these chance encounters, I've not only broadened my understanding of different cultures but have picked up a few fancy French phrases that make me sound, well… très chic!

**Derek's Tips for the Solo Vagabond 🧳**

1. **Stay Curious:** Let your inquisitiveness guide your footsteps. Trust me, detours lead to the best discoveries.

2. **Embrace the Solitude:** It’s daunting at first, but dining alone at a French bistro becomes a delightful self-date with every new dish.

3. **Pack Light, Travel Right:** You'll thank yourself when rolling those cobbled streets!

4. **Say Yes to New Experiences:** Try the escargot! Or, you know, maybe just start with ice wine… baby steps.

In closing, I invite you to let the magic of Quebec City be a milestone in your solo travel chronicles. With history, culture, and tantalizing cuisines at every turn, your own adventure awaits! So what’s holding you back? Solo travel is the ultimate write-your-own-story escapade. Ready... set... wander! 🧭✨

1glh8gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethTeckenbrock/comments/1glh8gn/clarification_on_tampa_pd_post/,"CLARIFICATION on ""Tampa PD"" Post","Took a stroll over to the other side and saw some soggy piece of toast said that my Tampa PD post was ""proof that Andrew abused Liz.""

**I put this in the comments of my post but felt the need to make this way more noticeable.** The police record for the ""Battery"" where Liz is labeled a ""Victim"" in December of 2022 coincides with the DV case in Dec of 2022 (22-DR-017267) in Hillsborough County in which the case was **denied after hearing.**

>*Liz called and said she was the victim, so that's what they put on the report. There is no category for ""liar.""*

>*What we know for a fact is, the police were called and Liz said she was the victim of DV and there was a subsequent petition to the court for an RO, that was, and I quote directly from the Hillsborough website, ""denied petition after hearing.""*

>*It's also a fact that Andrew was not arrested for DV (or battery) in Dec of 2022, or ever. I can't screenshot a negative. Such arrest does not exist.*

>Here is where my deductive reasoning comes in. The police were called; they come out to the scene where this DV/battery occurred. If marks, scratches, bruises, redness, etc. were present on Liz's body, Andrew would have been arrested. In addition, Liz would have been able to provide proof (marks, bruises, scratches, etc.) when she went to court. Since there was no police report that contained such information, the RO was denied.

**I'd like to address some comments I saw.** I refuse to engage directly with the type of people that exist in the AC sub so I'm going to paste them here so that anyone within our sub can engage. *(If you don't understand what I mean by this, you probably haven't been around long enough to have witnessed their behavior and you're lucky.)*

Yes, his own people are exposing the truth. I am not going to redact information or crop it all out like you just did, and continue to do, to make anyone look better... or worse for that matter because I wouldn't redact stuff to make Liz look worse, either.

**The DV petition was denied after the hearing. Per the court records.** I'm not interpreting the information to be anything other than exactly what it is. **Denied. After. Hearing.**

>*""Remember that report she read on TT where he tried to file against her but was denied bc he was a suspect in a battery case involving her.""*

Yes, I remember. So, what *actually* happened was Andrew wanted to document with the police that she was falsely accusing him of DV. The police officer told Andrew that her making these accusations on TT was not a criminal offense (even if they're false) because she was not making the allegations to law enforcement. Oh look, proof. Because I'm not trying to spin anything.

*""However there is RMS history listing him as a suspect in DV battery where she was listed victim.""*

Andrew's ability to file a report against her, or press charges, had **nothing to do with him being a suspect in a DV case against Liz. He could not press charges or file a complaint against Liz** ***because it was not a criminal offense.***

Brittany (whoever she is - iykyk) could file a complaint against ""Golf"" and Nicole for harassment. That would immediately make Brittany the victim and Nicole & ""Golf"" the suspect(s). Anyone can make a gd police report and call themselves a victim.

There is only **one police report** where Liz is listed as the victim and Andrew is listed as the suspect. The one where the RO was **denied after hearing.**

Now Rach is trying to tell the internet *""If there was no need for a report, one wouldn't have been written.""* Rach, my dear, you have embarrassed yourself enough on the internet already. I know you think you're smarter than everyone in the room. I know you know the governor. Maybe you were drunk for this part of law school. **Every time the cops respond to a call, they must write a report. Every. Single. Time.**

Here you have it. The AC sub is full of bullshit tweaked to fit whatever the narrative of the day is. Temporary-Nebula aka r/rachresesnark says so. Still waiting to see if she replies to Coffee but doesn't appear she will.

**It truly baffles me how in one document, Liz & her deadbeat-mom, police-biting entourage want to take something so literal as to not apply common sense, but then in another document they spin it, remove words, add some words, crop out what fits their narrative, and make a whole new story line.**

I guess I didn’t realize that sugar and liquid are really the only things needed for a healthy kombucha. 

Has anyone brewed from the beginning (1F) from something other than tea? (Obviously you would start with tea mix and change it over.) The coffee kombucha sounded interesting as well as the apple juice one.

Also, the discussion on sugar content was interesting. Here is the excerpt:

> Sweetness is expressed in degrees Brix (°Bx)—a measure of the amount of dissolved sucrose (table sugar) as a percentage of the total solution (grams of sugar divided by the total grams of sugar and water combined). We find that a kombucha made from a high starting Brix of 35°Bx (very sweet) will not be anywhere near as delicious as one made from a more moderate starting Brix. A kombucha started at 35°Bx will contain too much sugar and too much acid. We've settled at 12°Bx for most of our kombucha recipes.

Which was interesting to me so I calculated the “standard” recommendation of 1 cup granulated sugar per gallon of tea for kombucha at about 5.3 °Bx. (200 g sugar in a cup / 3,785 g in a gallon of water = ~5.3% or 5.3°Bx) So, perhaps the recommendation should be around 2 cups per gallon based on the 12°Bx guideline?",1,1730949471.0,Kombucha,5,1.0,False

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract

# For the Chocolate Glaze

* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
* 2/3 cup heavy cream (add more if needed)
* 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract (optional)
* 1 (4-oz) chocolate bar, shaved for garnish (optional)

# 👩‍🍳 Instructions

# Step 1: Prepare the Cake Batter

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and generously grease a 12-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray.
2. **Melt Butter and Cocoa**: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, coffee, and cocoa powder. Stir until melted and smooth, then remove from heat and let cool slightly.
3. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, sift together the granulated sugar, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the melted butter mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing until well combined. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to incorporate everything.
5. **Add Eggs and Flavorings**: Add eggs one at a time, mixing until combined after each addition. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.

# Step 2: Bake the Cake

1. **Pour Batter**: Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula.
2. **Bake**: Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
3. **Cool**: Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then carefully invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely.

# Step 3: Make the Chocolate Glaze

1. **Melt Chocolate**: Place the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 1 minute. Whisk until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, add an additional tablespoon of cream. Stir in the vanilla, if desired.
2. **Glaze the Cake**: Place the cooled cake on a serving platter. Pour the glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Allow the glaze to set slightly.
3. **Garnish**: Top with chocolate shavings if you’d like to add a little extra flair!

Serve and enjoy this beautiful, indulgent chocolate bundt cake – perfect for any occasion!

1glgqq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/YellowstonePN/comments/1glgqq5/s5a_musings/,S5-A musings,"I’m going to drop my musings on 5A here on Reddit because I’ve just rewatched, and it was really as all over the place as I felt like it was 2 years ago. Taylor Sheridan dropped the ball on writing for Beth, or maybe even at all. Beth’s accent was kind of weird this season, but that’s just an aside. I know she’s British and I think she’s an amazing talent. 

This is all over the place just as I rewatched, but made me realize how little substance was in the “first half” of season 5. 

5.1 - Beth and Rip flashback - a lot of age from the first meeting and abortion, even in the story, bc Beth is going to college - or is TS that bad of a time keeper? A nice current day scene with Beth and Rip - but I don’t know why he can’t ask any questions about anything. Ever. She’s clearly hurting, and he never ever pushes. The scene was beautiful and a great start for my favorite part of the show, but I’ve been yearning for Beth to open it to Rip about her innermost demons. 

Also. Why are Kayce and Monica planning on having a baby in Billings? That’s not even close to where anyone lives and isn’t a city we’ve been to in this universe. 

5.2 - Rip is unnecessarily mean to Carter in a way that feels like he wouldn’t be like that to anyone else on the ranch? Or maybe I just want him to be nicer because Carter is Rip and no one was nice to Rip at that age either. Especially not Beth.
This was my only takeaway from this episode. 

5.3 - I’m not even sure the bar fight feels completely in character for Beth - but I assume this is to show that Bozeman has changed a lot during even the length of the show. No cowboys left anymore in the city. 

5.4 - The histrionics of Beth and Jamie are truly old, at least at this level. The fact that it’s only escalating does not please me. I do however understand her pain and hatred, and I do tend to side with her over Jamie in all things. Jamie is really well played, as is Beth, but I don’t look forward to any of their interactions anymore. 

The timing of this season is very weird. What time has passed? A lot with the governor, not a lot with Beth in jail or with the funeral for baby John. 

Kayce is so greasy. Even at a funeral. 

5.5
 - He says  only been governor a week??

Rip has never made Beth work for anything, and he also has never been real willing to tell her of his affections. So their scene getting outfitted was sweet even if superficial, and showed them where they are in their relationship, which is a comfortable place and a place where she wants to be with him enough to go off roughing it on a horse.  

Bipolar Beth and Rip parenting at the small table. Idk why John wants everyone to eat at the table so bad for 5 seasons - it never ends well at all, but he can’t help it. I favor the small table. 

The fight with Beth and Summer was dumb - but not as dumb as the bar fight. Beth being physical is more over the top than when she’s just fighting with her brains, or fighting back. 

Rip still like a dog in the house afraid of the broom with the whiskey and John - and that makes me sad. I wish John had once told Rip he was proud that he and Beth are happy, proud of how Rip does his job, etc. 

The actor playing Tate must not be able to ride a horse for shit. 

5.6 - 
Beth ruining John’s moment in nature — I guess it suits her personality and it got a chuckle, but damn she really is mean. I don’t know how anyone could sit where she sits and not see beauty everywhere. 

The dog shooting almost ruined the whole show for me. I hate it. I hate how people don’t keep their dogs secure also, but damn. 

Sarah and Jamie and the woe is me mindfuck is too much. The shower scene where she basically says she wants to kill John might make 5B make sense though. 

The vegan can’t peel a potato. 

Kayce wasn’t the original heir. Lee was. I don’t know why they forget he existed. Summer is an ass and Monica makes good points, which is me saying something nice about Monica. 

Tate annoys me. 

Beth and Rip and their perfect meadow…and the dialogue seems off to me. Like the tenderness and vulnerability was missing here, and I really think it’s just poor writing. This season has been breadcrumbs for Beth and Rip, and their dialogue in this scene seemed like it could have been so much more. It started out okay, until the whiskey. I don’t mind the word fuck or motherfucker at all, but it was a little too much “fuck, you’re a good man” and “you know I’m blowing you anyway” and “you’re a perfect motherfucker” - it just didn’t suit the rest of the scene to me. I loved the rest of the scene and the sincerity that all they need is each other. 

Also, Beth would have brought her own smokes and drinks - but she’s on vodka this season. The actress must be over the dark drinks, or Tito’s needed the endorsement. 

The no dialogue morning after scene with Beth covered with Rip’s jacket and her coffee was so perfect.

I really like Lynelle. And I like her with John. And I like how she told him how dumb he is. I could have done without Summer entirely, in all ways. 

Beth and Rip watching Walker sing - great scene. She knows he’s sensitive, and I love that they see the softness in each other. 
I don’t like Walker or his music at all. 

5.7
 the flashback was really well done, I feel like it explains a lot of why Rip is so indebted to John, but it truly was an accident when he killed Rowdy. Labeling him a killer after that really is unfair, IMO (in Hollywood). He did not intend to kill him, and even covered him up for warmth before bed and tried to take care of him and have him drink water and truly tried to help him. Rowdy did pull a knife on him. The parallel with Rowdy and Walker pulling a knife on Rip is a nice bridge from past to present. 

I love young Lloyd so much; it’s perfect casting with the actor son playing him, and Rip already knowing that that was his family. I John was wrong to use that loyalty to imprison Rip, even though he is always a willing prisoner with his loyalty never wavering. 

Even now with all that Rip has proven with his loyalty of family and the ranch, John will put him at risk not caring what that does to Beth. Everyone can be sacrifice except for Kayce and Tate. 

Did Jaime taint the cattle? He was raised to know and wanted to do ranch work and not law. I didn’t think that before, but had this thought on the rewatch. 

Beth’s view on marriage really is lovely. She’s married to the love of her life and she’s so proud to be married. It’s wholesome. 
Beth and Monica’s conversation and Beth opening up to Monica about her own loss made me hope she’s one step closer to telling Rip before this show ends. 

Brucellosis isn’t a bad plot for getting to Texas…

Girl power Gun Power LOL Teeter. 

Kayce so stupid - Rip knows he’s the one who will have to go, and I hate that for him. For Rip to be displaced from the only home he’s known because he’s the manager, when Kayce has no loyalty and is always looking for a new home. 

I love Lloyd and Rip’s chat and them both wanting to kill Walker. I don’t want them to actually kill him, but I’m not a fan. 

Beth’s hair looks so good when she’s in the house and John comes in looking for land to send the cattle. Her telling John not to break and heirloom makes me think she’s gone soft. But her business model has potential and John’s isn’t working, so of course this isn’t something John can consider. 

Jamie is such a puppet on anyone’s string. Idk what ride Sarah is taking him for, and I don’t actually care. 

Beth’s business brain should have cared about this business a long time ago - and this could be the spinoff that I no longer want to watch because TS has lost his touch with writing. 

The fair doesn’t make a lot of plot sense, but I enjoyed Rip asking Beth, much like the music festival she didn’t want to go to, and seeing her absolutely want to go. And Rip calling her sweetie seems so brave, because she isn’t that. 

Rip called Carter son, and to me it paralleled John calling Rip son. Carter’s storyline could have been so much more. 

The arrival to the fair with Rip giving Carter money and them looking like a family and how comfortable Beth and Rip are together made me think of the rodeo scene from season 3 (I think) when John tells Rip that he can hold her damn hand. Rip also knows he better open her damn door, which I don’t think Beth would allow just anyone to do. I just hope they get their happy ending and that it is an ending. 

John and Summer are just gross to me. Kayce is also the most unwashed cowboy in all the land. Does he bathe?

Teeter and her BAeR. 

Beth finally asking Rip how long they’ll be gone and saying she can’t survive that and that they made promises to each other was probably one of their best scenes of the season. Some of the verbiage in this scene reminds me of the proposal scene. I would like to compare them side by side. 

Ryan and Abby. Idk if I thought Ryan wanted to be a cowboy that bad. But whatever. 

John and Summer are just a dumb story. Even if she says she understands him and has had this pivotal moment, I just hate it. His bedroom eyes for her are grossing me out more every day. 

5.8 -
 Rip being branded - John was not that worried about Beth, and it just shows that Rip has always cared more about Beth than he cares about anyone else - even when she was terrible to him. His staying was already for her as much as for John and the ranch. 

Jimmy in Texas would have made sense if this show were not so disjointed - like a lead in the the 6666 show that may never be (and that I wasn’t ever that interested in anyway). But how Jimmy and whatever her name is get a better scene than Beth and Rip is beyond me. No one cares. 

John giving Kayce yet another house. Poor Beth and Rip can’t escape him. 

The political aspect is getting interesting and then a two year break in filming makes me think nothing is going to pretend to make sense. So all I’m worried about is Beth and Rip. 

Beth saying goodbye - broke my heart a lot. 

How did Beth not know about the train station but knew about the train station? Or did she just think she was following Jamie to dump a body? But now Jamie has screamed all of this for Sarah to know. I hate Sarah, but Jamie is definitely her puppet. Beth looked really rattled though, and this was some of the best tension Jamie and Beth have had in a while. 

Beth confronting John and John acting like she’s been playing ignorant when he never tells her every bit of truth just makes me ready for him to die and the chains to break. 

Jamie thinking Beth will kill him and plotting with Sarah makes me nervous bc I think Sarah is smarter than Jamie, even though I don’t like her or the character. Could she speak any more slowly? It’s awful. 

I don’t care about Kayce or Monica, but he’s so dirty and greasy and I want him to have a new hat and a shower. 


So all in all, other than worries for Beth and Rip, I’m ready to be done with this show. 

I am still hopeful for more 1923, but it feels likely that it will be as disjointed as everything else, so maybe it’s best left in the past.

I (23f) am working on a character-driven, multi-POV fantasy novel that I absolutely love—and that drives me insane in the most wonderful way! I’ve somehow managed 90k words so far, and I’d love to find a community of writers to grow with!

I began writing this book when the aches in my joints were only whispers. Then came the loss of doing mundane activities like being able to use circular door knobs or chopping onions. And finally, the medical leave of absence I refuse to call dropping out of college. The silver lining is that I’ve been forced to follow my dream: writing novels of my own, albeit with the help of voice to text! I hope my debut will resonate with readers who also feel grief towards their own body. 

Brief synopsis of my book (this is very much a WIP):

Cursed to be a doll and dealing with all the associated joint pain, Cordelia would give near anything to be as she once had been. Even defying fate itself by striking a deal with the illusive Fool. She agrees to assist The Fool in stealing his heart back in exchange for her becoming “real” again. All he needs to seal the deal is the last “real”part of her, her heart. 

Then there’s other POVS because of course she’s not the only one after a heart that powerful etc etc

Themes: Fate, disability, found family, love, truth in lies 

Books I’ve read and loved recently: Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi, Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Faerie, Half a Soul, The House in the Cerulean Sea, and Six of Crows.

Is this sensation normal with fasting? Does this ease up or go away as I get used to fasting again? Is there a way to stop the whoosh feeling (aside from eating lol)?

I dont know what to try anymore","even my far distant couple memories to grade school, always like being under water in a fog, maybe allergies related or chronic benedryl use. ...

and of those instances, one, I spent 14 some hours hiking and the other was reverse jet lag, crossed 12 time zones and had tons of energy for a week about 6+ years ago, depression was gone too, I was optimistic, it was so profound I incorporated this event into a password I used often. maybe it's sleep related. I've eliminated coffee most of this year, and found no difference. better posture with a laptop stand, so my neck quit hurting and I mostly no longer get migraines.

maybe it's still using the phone or computer up until bed most of my life.  or still life long depression, which I've done every single treatment you can think of except a lobotomy. And not one changed the fog.

during covid I spend about $2k on every supplement and nootropic with no luck. depression was better, but brain fog and focus not. I think all those tests were tainted with caffeine use though.

tried tDCs for a bit with no luck, currently using a TENs to stimulate my vagus nerve for 30 min a day with also no change. I got these ridiculously huge red laser glasses to block all blue light at night I'll wear consistently now. 

beyond that, I dont know, coming winter makes it worse, allergies make it worse, excess coffee made it worse, maybe carbs make it worse, tried b vitamines with no change, would an injection matter? primary care nurse practitioner never really helped or cared to, some insurance, cant even see a real doc. adderall maybe wakes me up a bit, but it's like energy with fog, sometimes in skipping sleep the fog is less. cold showers never did anything, warm compress, or ice packs on the head or neck never did anything, meditation didnt really change anything, melatonin significantly shortens my sleep to 5-6 hours leaving me just groggy all day. 

probably night time blue light isnt helping, but I wonder how people watch tv every night without issues, I fall asleep. I dont appear to have sleep apnea, had a sleep study that said mild central apnea, but the machines had lots of issues, and my 3rd opinion concluded it was a poorly done study, and a half year of attempting a cpap bipap asv didnt really work out at all.",2,1730947381.0,BrainFog,0,1.0,False

The thing is that we recently moved back to her home country, and she’s met with about a dozen of her old friends from high school, but I’ve never met any of them. 

I’ve been searching online and it seems like the answers on this are very split. 

Since the question says “have you…”and not “you or your spouse,” and also their “bonds of affection” are only high school friends who meet once a year or so, so I feel like I can put no, but I don’t want it to cause issues down the line. 

On one hand I would think just play it safe, but on the other hand idk if they’re close enough to be comfortable sharing all of their personal information (they aren’t super close, they meet at coffee/tea shops in public, not each others house, etc) so don’t want to be intrusive if it’s not necessary.

Lately I have been struggling with providing emotional support for my partner and seeing my relationship from an unbiased perspective, so any insight is truly appreciated. 

My boyfriend and I have a healthy relationship. We have a history of toxic behavior patterns but we worked together to grow and transform them into healthy ones. I am sure of his love for me, and I truly love him as well. He is very loyal, supportive and kind. 

Over the past couple of months, however, I have been dreading having a conversation with him. I sometimes avoid asking him about his day, and I feel really guilty about this. He has been going through a tough time. He lost a family member he loved and lived with. He has made an investment in something and every day is an anxious roller coaster of “will it work out” or “will I lose everything”. 

I have tried several ways of being supportive. I listen, I always let him know I believe in him, and I offer my views when I think they are useful. 

Thankfully, I am in a good place in life right now. I struggled for several years back, and I built myself up emotionally and came to a stable position. 

What I struggle with is constantly having to worry about something. I can’t share the good parts of my day with him, and I feel guilty when I do something for myself (like grabbing coffee with a friend or having a good time). I also believe that he does not have sufficient coping skills, and in tough times I worry about him a lot. He yells, kicks and punches things and this is really scary for me. I try not to make things about myself but I feel my arms and legs go numb on these occasions. 

I feel like a terrible, selfish and disloyal partner when saying this but I just can’t deal with this anymore. Sometimes I wish he would break up or do something that would make my breaking up valid. I also feel disloyal and I don’t want to he someone who leaves when things get hard. 

I am very conflicted about this situation. I know I am in a very judge-able position, but I am desperate for some advice.

I purchased a colonial style hose. The kitchen and living room area have these dark ceiling beams. I like them a lot, I think they go with the house. The ceiling is only 8'. I believe they will have to stay with any sort of redesign, unless you have a better idea, but it makes the two rooms flow together.

The previous owner painted the cabinets non-professionally. They look very tired in person. Not really the clean look we like but not sure what to do here. We added some cheap similar cabs in the corners as you can see next to the window in order to enlarge the working counter space and cabinet storage. That really helped with the size of the kitchen. The house is 3K sqft. so we thought making that whole area a kitchen space was needed. The countertops are cheap laminate and will definitely be changed.

We cut down a massive black walnut out of the side yard and are drying it for the wood right now. We planned to use it for countertops, and matching floating shelves over the two side runs. We were thinking of doing all countertops with this because we have over 300 board feet of gorgeous black walnut heartwood. Additionally, with the dark beams, it should make it flow together nicely.

The cabinets we got don't perfectly match the ones that were in the kitchen and are a different shade of white.

We are trying for an English Countryside design theme. Our house is on a fairly wooded acre and is a saltbox colonial for context. We planned to put a small 2 person ""patio table"" type table in front of the little window for a breakfast / coffee spot. It's very pretty outside in the mornings.

House value is about 500k and I'd spend up to 100K+ to fully redesign the kitchen if it could be amazing. I know I won't ""get"" the value back out if I sell the house, This expense is just for my family and I to enjoy.

**QUESTIONS AS FOLLOWS:**

1. Should we redesign this kitchen further, going down to the studs and moving everything around?
2. Would you agree we need to leave the dark beams?
3. Would you agree that using the black walnut from the yard will be cool to install as the countertops / shelves for the kitchen? Would you use that wood for all the countertops, or perhaps two different types of countertops like we set it up currently? Is black walnut even very pretty for kitchen counters? It doesn't seem super common even in designer kitchens.
4. Do you think all the cabinets should be replaced? Or professionally refinished to make them match?
5. Assuming we do  the dark walnut throughout on counter tops and 1 or 2 floating shelves above each side of the windows;

5A. What color floor should we go with, we were originally partial to this cool dark floor we found. It would look good in our entryway as well. [https://imgur.com/a/zVnNXyU](https://imgur.com/a/zVnNXyU)  We aren't really into the white ceramic tile that came with the house.

5B. What color cabinets would look good in combination with the floor?

6. What should we do about the backsplash? The way it's currently set up, the cabinet that is closest to the living room has about 3 inches all the way up to the ceiling that is painted. If we did a waterfall marble backsplash or something, not sure how we could even get such a sliver up that high. Above the window cabinets, would you do the same backsplash up to the first or second shelf?

Any thoughts, recommendations or ideas are greatly appreciated! I'll be online to respond to any questions

Does anyone know what I should have done? I just got out of a long term relationship not to long ago so not sure if I came on to strong? Don’t also do casual things so maybe there was a misunderstanding?

I'm 32, male, 181lb, 6'0"", Southeast Asian, average build. A professional engineer by day and a food dispenser for my cat by night. A bit of a homebody and night owl so I don't often get the chance to meet people, so giving reddit a go. Dating apps are just... no.

I currently live on my own and my two big hobbies are anime and videogames. Currently obsessed with FFXIV, Honkai: Star Rail, and Hololive lol. Other hobbies being sleeping, cooking, visiting new coffee shops, trying new foods, biking on trails, and making poor attempts at exercise to stay in shape. I only ask that you aren't overweight yourself.

Let's chat about our passions and hobbies or let me see how many times I can make you laugh. We don't have to like all the same things, tell me what you're into! Would love a genuine connection that could lead to long term dating but I'm open for anything. ",0,1730946035.0,MeetPeople,0,0.5,False

While I would love to feel the excitement this moment deserves I’m more terrified than anything. This is as far as we got earlier this year. Lost the pregnancy at 7 weeks. 

Previous to my MMC in April, I had a blighted ovum in 2017. It’s just so hard to believe that this will actually happen for me. 

This time around my OBgYN started me on progesterone suppositories once I found out I was pregnant and I added baby aspirin. I also cut out coffee. I know it’s out of my hands but it’s so hard. Wishing everyone the stickiest of baby’s ❤️",10,1730945968.0,July2025Bumps,2,1.0,False

He mocked Shrutika with Salman's Victim card remark and then Denied it to her face. He accepted it only after he was cornered for his Lie.

Now, his Chor Chugli gang hid regular Tea packet and Vivian lied that he kept it in store room and Bigg Boss took it.

In front of him, Bagga was not eating anything since morning for his Tea. Still, he didnt have the humanity to make his gang of Chors to give him Tea.

Avinash had stolen some coffee too which Vivian knew and he made coffee out of it secretly.

Then, only when he needed his special french press in the night, he asked Avinash to return back the Tea and again Lied that he went for medical n requested Bigg Boss to give Tea and they gave it at his request.

Kitna besharam aadmi hai.  It is another thing that Bagga and Sara both called out his Lies and said that it was the same Tea packet they stole and hid the previous day and not any new packet.

Itna bada Bhukkad Chor aur Choron ka sardar hokar bhi Classist attitude dekho saale ki. Chahat ko cheap, disgusting bol raha tha.

None of the other Housemates are Thieves. Except these Four persons. Within four days, he and Avinash hid coffee. Even when Avinash was in Jail, he and Vivian stole a coffee bag and hid it. When Avinash's Jail term ended, he and chugli gang hid Rajma, coffee n many items in the house. Before Chahat searched and returned their stolen goods back to Jail.

Sara and Chahat only retaliated by hiding lemon tea bags and french press that too openly after 1 month of their nonstop Chori and to force this Gang of Thieves to give back their Tea bag.

As per Livefeed, Avinash was caught stealing Sugar free Stevia from ration too yesterday by Shrutika and Sara.

On Top of it, Vivian kal Rajat ko bol raha tha ki ""Jab tu Jail mein tha toh equal Khana kyun nahi diya"". Accha, Jab Avinash Jail mein tha, tab khud luxury khana khakar baaki sabko 2 apples mein bhukh mitane ki justification de raha tha.

Moral high ground kahan se laate ho bhai. Kuch toh sharam kar.

When Vivian got chocolates as a Time God , he didnt distribute it to all Housemates. He gave it to only his Chor chugli group. But, the other group distributed the cheese reward to all. Yahi farak hai dono mein

No more easily accessible, clean drinking water in the workplace because apparently, it’s “too costly.” They expect us to bring our own or use the grimy tap water in the break room sink that tastes like it came straight from a rusty pipe.

This is a place where we work eight or more hours a day, and now they’re treating water – a basic human necessity – as some kind of luxury they can’t afford. Meanwhile, I’m pretty sure the execs are still getting their gourmet coffee and catered meals on the company dime. The hypocrisy is staggering.

The kicker? They sent out an email about “this new policy” and tried to spin it like it was a thoughtful decision, saying we should “take pride in sustainability and reducing our environmental impact.” Right, because nothing screams sustainability like denying your employees access to safe drinking water.

How low can they go? It’s embarrassing and disrespectful. What’s next, charging us for bathroom use? At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised.",1,1730945765.0,u_mysticxgleam,0,1.0,False
