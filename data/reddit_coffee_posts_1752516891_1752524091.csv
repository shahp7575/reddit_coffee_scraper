Quarter to five, Mike sat patiently at his desk, the towering skyscrapers outside his window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards were the only sounds that broke the otherwise stifling silence. He worked a normal nine to five at a small office department, no wife or kids, and monthly paid rent on an overpriced apartment. In every meaning of the word, Mike could be described as just an average guy. What the outside eye misses is the intricacies and characteristics of every human being, as specific as they all are, are too much to ever define a person as, “Average.” Mike had his fair share of oddities, ones he tried to hide, like us all. He had many dreams, which you couldn’t see through the way he lived his life, and he wasn't the type to share them. Mike's work life was quite unintriguing, and not all of that was necessarily due to Mike.  Each morning, colleagues shuffled in, their faces blank, their greetings automated. They moved like clockwork, pouring identical cups of coffee, settling into the same worn chairs, their actions devoid of spontaneity. Their work life was a relentless hamster wheel, a futile chase after a carrot forever dangling just out of reach. Each day bled into the next, an endless cycle of monotony that led nowhere and to nothing. Mike would leave his work parking lot at almost the exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. He would then take a few left and right turns until he got to the auditorium. The auditorium screamed with neglect, its faded velvet seats ripped and stained, the air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams. But to Mike, it pulsed with possibility, each broken chair a testament to the magic it once held within its walls. He had been working for this moment for months and months, imagining and replaying his dream over and over again in his head. It became his driving force, completely infatuated with his dream, the dream of being a magician. It was an odd dream, not shared by many. Interest sparked in Mike at a young age, his seventh birthday party, and in which his parents hired a magician. The magician put on a fantastic show, loud applause rained from both him and all of his classmates that his mother had invited. In that moment Mike knew what he wanted, and it never changed. Even if we deny it, or are scared to admit it, it's what we all deep down inside want and crave. The dream of being something special. For Mike, he planned this his whole life. Before he went to sleep, while he was asleep dreaming, sitting in the back of class, all Mike ever imagined to do was to have an audience cheer him on, and give him the same affection that they did that magician at his seventh birthday party. If this could just go right for Mike this time, everything would be alright, it would all be fixed. The show began, presented by Mikey the magic man. Afee, a few basic introduction tricks the audience clapped, but not at the tone he remembered. He thinks back to the only way he could really impress them, he must put all his chips on the table and go for the prestige. This act would make or break Mike's show, and in reality his life as well. Mike pivoted quickly, and remembered the act that wowed his classmates so long ago, the infamous saw act. It was fairly simple, one he had practiced many times over and over in his head. All he would have to do is saw a woman in half and put her back together. The trick had been done many times by others, and for a magician of Mike's caliber should be inconsequential. The first cut was clean, the body was split into halves. Mike glanced at the crowd, expecting applause, but met only silence. Faces contorted in disgust, eyes burning with a hatred he couldn't comprehend. A cold dread washed over him. Had he miscalculated? What went wrong? Excruciatingly, he looks back onto the stage.  Every fiber in his body felt empty, like he was stuck in this moment for decades. What had once been complete, then broken, was entirely incomplete now. Her body laid lifeless, guts falling onto the stage, Mike immediately covers his face to mask the smell of a rotting corpse, as he loosens his ever tight grip of the saw, dropping it right into his victims still-pumping heart. As he turns away towards the audience, they start to scream and concurrently trash the stage. He begs and pleads for forgiveness, but is met with a pure moment of anarchy. All that was once slow, was now racing around and nothing makes sense. Did anything ever make sense? Or was the discontentment masked by the revolving door.  Mike scans around the room and trembles in fear. The dream was over, he would wake up soon but the show could not go on. Even after the chaos, it couldn't be the same. Mike dropped down to the floor, sobbing and screaming in agony. Despair consuming him, he clawed at his scalp, tufts of hair scattering like fallen leaves. Then, with a gut wrenching scream, he gouged at his eyes, the vibrant blue fading into a bloody mess. He tore at his skin, desperate to shed the weight of his failure, until finally, only the stark, white bones of his shattered dreams remained on his decrepit body. His mangled skeleton figure laid there on stage, still being trashed by the crowd, greasy popcorn and flat soda covered his remains. Mike had reduced himself down into nothing and nobody.

8:37 am. Then came nine. Programmed, programmed to come in, say the same things, drink the same coffee, sit in the same seat, and do the same unimportant work every single day. A hamster wheel back and forth, futilely chasing at something that can never be obtained. Mike would leave his work parking lot at the same exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. Nothing compares to childhood innocence, fever dreams, a fading memory. A revolving door never stops its orbit, until you step out.",1,1752523862.0,u_Pretend-Profile-1892,0,1.0,False

My last several runs I’ve had very bothersome acid reflux/stomach pains once I hit about 2 miles into a run. I run fasted in the morning or at least three hours after eating. If I have any coffee at all it’s bad. It seems like even sometimes a banana isn’t sitting well. 

I don’t really have many gastrointestinal side effects in Zep other than this. I’m never nauseated or vomitting. Once is a while (like once a week or so) I’ll experience a similar kind of stomach/acid pain right when I wake up in the morning. Any tips to help this? Should I run with Tums? Take some before the run? Take an OTC acid reflux medication every day or just in running days?

I’ve been lucky with side effects for most of the 9 months I’ve been on the meds, and this didn’t use to happen when running.  I think it might be correlated to when I went up in dose to 12.5mg. I don’t want to change my dose at all, but maybe it’s just a bit too much when running? 

The first time it was really bad was during a race (I probably could have had a 5k PR otherwise!) but it happens on easy runs too.

1lzx1iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1lzx1iv/health_anxiety_after_eds_confirmed/,Health Anxiety after EDS confirmed,"In the long 3 year search for what is wrong with me I had multiple cancer scares that actually ended up being related to my connective tissues. I had numerous ultrasounds, scans, specialists and even a biopsy. Thank God they all came back clear. For a long time the mystery illness was likely cancer and I was living in a state of constant fear and anxiety around my health—this was made worse by doctors who say it’s probably cancer like they’re telling you their coffee order as well as doctors just generally being dismissive as I am a woman and uni student. 

I have now got confirmation that I have EDS but I have to get genetic testing to see which type as I show signs of vascular, classical and hypermobile. A lot of the scarier mystery symptoms are linked to EDS so for a short while the health based anxiety settled so much. 

However, when I have a new pain or feeling that aren’t the usual daily pains or sensations my brain jumps directly back to the health anxiety default setting which is unfortunately cancer due to the multiple scares I’ve had. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience of either cancer scares from EDS symptoms or residual health anxiety even now having the knowledge of your conditions and an understanding of many symptoms. 

The anxiety flares have been quite bad recently since the vascular type has entered the chat so that’s probably not helping me move past it. ",1,1752523686.0,eds,0,1.0,False
1lzx1ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lzx1ej/cmv_casual_restaurants_would_be_better_off_if/,CMV: Casual Restaurants would be better off if they just got rid of servers,"With the cost of eating out getting more expensive, I think that a simple solution would be to just eliminate servers from most casual dining restaurants (Applebee's, Red Robin, Chili's) as they don't really add much to the dining experience.

You can order food off a Tablet, go pick up your food from the Kitchen, and fill your own drinks from a Soda Machine. You don't really need to be paying 20% more to justify such frivolous tasks at a casual restaurant when you as the guest could easily do these three simple tasks. Sure you lose the . . .  Awkward small talk, the fake politeness, and the annoying happy birthday songs. But is that really worth a 20% surcharge?

Maybe if it is a bar and grill you can just walk up to a bartender for your alcoholic drinks. Same for places that serve coffee. Just walk up to the Barista.

Yes High End restaurants do benefit from servers, but would your experience at Chili's really change if you had to use a Tablet and go pick up your food at a counter? For an example of a casual restaurant that fits this description, look at Fazolis or Panera Is there anything having a server would add to your experience at Fazolis or Panera? Why do we need one at Chili's?

I'm designing a new donut shop/cafe in an existing space. The owner has lots of professional baking experience, but has never worked making coffee beverages for the public. I have designed many cafe's and bars over the years, but the owner or some other consultant usually determines the equipment layout. This owner is relying on me and the advice of family and friends, and I've never worked in any type of retail food service (my mother was a caterer, so I have many hundreds of hours of professional kitchen experience, but that does not translate to understanding direct customer service). 

My primary concerns are these: 

1. What is a good service aisle width? We are not pressed for space, but the owner wants to keep a wide open area between the service counters and maximize seating.  
2. The coffee station area is pre-defined by the existing column. Are things too compact here? How much prep space do you need on the side of the espresso machine (3-station). 
3. How deep should the coffee station counter be? 
4. Dishwasher drop-down doors are an issue in almost all kitchens. Is there a better place to locate the dishwasher and sink?  
5. Where should an undercounter ice-maker go?

Any and all advice on the layout below would be appreciated.

\-- --

**Blurb:**

When a fantasy kingdom needs heroes, they skip the high schoolers and summon hardened Delta Force operators.

Lieutenant Cole Mercer and his team are no strangers to sacrifice. After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.

Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.

But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human.

**Arcane Exfil Chapter 38:** Overclocked

\-- --

With nothing scheduled for the rest of the day, they wrapped up with a quick visit to the infirmary to check up on Elina. Snippets of analyses from Kidry had already started to trickle in, the prognoses looking worse by the day. All they could do was hope for some sort of breakthrough in the coming days.



The drive back from the OTAC facility in Warren’s Forëa was filled with talk of plasmaballs – tactical shop talk to decompress after a productive session.



The manor was quiet when they returned, the staff having settled in already. Tenna met them in the foyer with a crisp nod, elegant as she’d been during the interview. Looked like she’d already familiarized herself with the layout, fitting right in.



After taking some time to wind down, Cole had tasked Darin with investigating Alexandria’s port for anything resembling coffee or other foreign stimulants Miles kept mentioning – and the general market, while he was at it. Darin, working out of a small office beside the library, had grasped the need quickly, outlining a plan to leverage both official manifests and dockside contacts. He’d estimated a day or two for a preliminary assessment of what was actually available and moving through the port, with a full survey taking longer.



Darin was already starting to demonstrate his effectiveness, but it was Lisara who’d made the most immediate difference. Their new chef had, as promised, demonstrated her knowledge of Japanese cuisine and prepared a surprisingly decent approximation of teriyaki chicken using local ingredients. The sauce wasn’t quite right – missing mirin and using some citrus native to Celdorne – but it hit close enough to home that Mack had nearly teared up at the first bite. That, combined with a rice variety that wasn’t jasmine but did the job, had been exactly what they needed after a long day of magic demonstrations.



Later, Cole sought out Melnar about mental enhancement magic. He figured the former combat officer would have relevant experience, and to no one’s surprise, he did. Melnar confirmed its importance for officers needing quick assessment and directed Cole straight to three specific volumes in the manor’s library.



Cole and the others spent the evening skimming the books, processing the basics. Mental clearing, calibration, controlled mana infusion. From what he gathered, the technique was essentially neural stimulation via mana – using magical energy to enhance signal transmission in the brain.



Like overclocking a processor, as Ethan had put it. Or Adderall on steroids. The warnings were pretty stark, repeated throughout the text: push too hard, too fast, without the prep? Well, the consequences ranged from cognitive overload to mana feedback and seizures – all the fun stuff that came with messing around inside the brain.



The books provided a solid foundation, but they stopped short of practical application. That, presumably, was where Lady Verna came in.



They arrived back at OTAC the next morning, directed this time to a smaller, functional training hall lined with tables and chairs.



Verna awaited them, mindlessly juggling several balls. She caught them all with a flourish when she spotted their entrance, her face lighting up.



“Ah, at last. I was beginning to suspect you’d taken a scenic detour,” she said with a smile. “No matter, I’ve been dreadfully eager to begin. You see, I’ve spent the better part of the morning attempting to recreate that rather dramatic plasmaball spell from yesterday’s demonstration. With… limited success.”



She gave a mock wince. “The eastern training range, I fear, may now require a rather heroic effort from the groundskeepers.” She laughed lightly. “Sir Fotham, as you can imagine, was *thrilled*.”



“Hell, I wouldn’t be too enthused either if somebody went and tore up my backyard,” Miles snorted. “What’d he do – threaten to run you out to the Wastes or somethin’?”



“Something to that effect. He merely proposed that the Wastes might better suit my temperament. Less flammable architecture, I assume,” Verna replied, her smile not apologetic in the slightest.



Cole smirked. Verna’s thorough help aside, anyone who could get that excited creating bigger explosions was alright in his book. “I take it you managed to get it working properly?”



“After a fashion. Containment was… enthusiastic in its resistance.” She made a flicking gesture, as though brushing soot off her sleeve. “A valuable lesson in restraint. Or, at the very least, a memorable one.”



After arranging her juggled items neatly upon the table, her expression shifted. “But I suppose I’ve monopolized the morning long enough. We’ve rather a great deal to accomplish today. Are you ready?”



Mack raised his hand like he was giving her the floor. “Take it away, Professor.”



“Very well. To begin, you’ll find that a battlemage of true consequence learns this soon enough: there are moments in battle when force alone avails one nothing. Power, when wielded too slowly, is scarcely power at all. A spell must be cast in thought before it is cast by hand, and a sluggish mind leaves the hand far too late.”



She demonstrated by launching two fireballs, one faster than the other. As was the case in modern combat, he who landed the first strike usually finished it. Room clearing, for instance – fractions of a second decided who walked out. Faster processing meant faster targeting, faster trigger pull. Or faster spell-cast, same difference. Even in magic, speed was life.



“This spell was never meant to cultivate wisdom. It will not lend you judgment. That, you must supply yourself. It merely drives the mind faster, and should you lack direction, speed alone will serve you poorly. And there are mages – a regrettable number – for whom that has proven a misalignment.”



“Not the sword, but the swordsman,” Ethan agreed.



Verna nodded, continuing, “The ancients knew it as ‘quickening of thought’ – a phrase not without its theatricality, though I’d argue it captures the essence more faithfully than one might expect. The Office of Thaumaturgy, with its preference for austerity, now insists upon ‘mental acceleration’ or ‘mental enhancement’. I’m told the change was made in the interest of clarity.”



Mack tackled the elephant in the room. “So does everything else seem to slow down around you?”



Verna must’ve expected the question. She responded, unfazed, “In a manner of speaking. In those moments, the mind outruns the body – physical enhancement notwithstanding, and hesitation becomes a luxury one can briefly afford.”



Verna picked up one of the balls she’d been juggling earlier, tossing it back and forth between her hands. “Now, we shall begin with something benign. One object. One point of focus. Even the most disordered mind can manage that much without embarrassment.”



A second ball joined, then a third as she started juggling proper.



“Two may be done without thinking; three, with a little.”



She added a fourth, then a fifth. The motion hardly changed.



“With five, most find they can continue – provided nothing unexpected occurs. The pattern is regular; the rhythm can be memorized. However, should one object deviate, even slightly, the entire motion collapses.”



One ball rose higher than the rest, while another dipped low and crossed beneath, abandoning the circular pattern. 



She reiterated, “When the rhythm is disrupted, habit fails. The mind is compelled to resume full control – and most minds, I regret to say, prove unequal to the task. Therein lies the purpose of enhancement: to supplement where our biology fails.”



She restarted, adding more until ten balls were up. Now, ten wasn’t peak performance by any means; pros did that. What got Cole was the *chaos* of it – no rhythm, balls flying high and low, fast and slow, seemingly at random. It was entirely new territory, beyond what practice could prepare for. Should be impossible, yet there it was.



Verna continued to catch each one – not like some elegant Vegas showman, but without error. She stopped the sequence with no final flourish, lowering the objects onto the table with wind magic.



“Now, to the method – such as it is. The process, though simple in theory, unfolds in three stages. The first: a severing of distraction – that the mind may begin unburdened. The second: attunement, in which one takes the measure of their own cognition. The third: the enhancement itself – an infusion of mana, by which the mind is driven past its natural limit.”



Verna gestured toward the chairs arranged nearby. Cole took a seat, the others settling in right after him. Verna’s expression shifted then, levity leaving as she locked in.



“We shall commence with the clearing of your mind,” she said. Her tone left no doubt this part was critical. “Herein lies the foundation; neglect this stage, or approach it with undue haste, and all subsequent efforts shall prove markedly more troublesome, indeed perilous.”



Verna took a seat herself to demonstrate. No lotus position or anything fancy – she just sat normally and closed her eyes. Simple enough.



“Right then, eyes closed, if you would,” she instructed. “Now, I require your complete attention directed inward. Attend only to your breathing. Mark its steady passage, in and out. With each outward breath, you must deliberately set aside any stray thought, any flicker of concern or external trifle. Persist in this, gentlemen, until your mind rests quite still, entirely unburdened. Perfect tranquility is the aim; nothing less will properly serve for what follows.”



Cole closed his eyes, pushing thoughts away as they surfaced. Wasn’t that different from meditation, really – the kind his ex had dragged him to at that wellness center back in Arlington. All he was missing was the incense and some guy in linen pants telling him to find his center while making everyone chant “om.” The military version he’d learned was a lot more practical, though: no pseudo-spiritual trappings, just clearing his head so he could put three rounds in a target at 300 meters.



Attunement – or calibration, as Cole preferred to put it, triggered a connection. It was essentially the same as zeroing a weapon. Just, instead of accuracy, it was mental processing.



Cole held the focus, breathing steady. After what felt like several minutes, Verna's voice broke the quiet.



“Now, you must gently turn your awareness outward, making account of all that impinges upon your senses. The sounds from afar, yes? The very breath drawn by the man beside you. Take note of each impression as it arises, yet allow none to capture your attention fully. You are merely to register their passing.”



Cole executed the scan, letting sensory inputs wash over him without sticking. The distant pops of gunfire from another training area, the solid feel of the chair, the faint warmth of the sun peeking through the windows – all noted and dismissed.



“By these means,” Verna explained, “we ascertain the natural measure of your thoughts. Consider it an attunement of the mind, commencing at its own unhurried pace. Hereafter, should you prove able, we shall endeavor to quicken that pace considerably.”



Verna fell silent, letting the quiet stretch.



“Very good. Open your eyes.”



Cole opened his eyes, the room flooding his vision as he kept a calm, steady focus. Things looked sharper, more defined, but he chalked it up to focused attention, not any actual enhancement.



“Now for the third stage,” she continued, “the enhancement proper. And here we find a profound departure from mere physical augmentation. One may channel mana to invigorate the limbs, lending strength to sinew and bone. Yet, apply such force directly to the workings of the mind?” She paused, her expression conveying the warning clearly. “Attempting to ‘strengthen’ the brain so crudely... the consequences would be grave indeed.”



She paused. “Rather, the mana acts merely as a... goad, perhaps? An impetus. It contrives no novel avenues of thought, nor imposes any unnatural condition. It simply permits the mind's existing channels to function with greater alacrity.”



Cole got the gist: mana as stimulant, boosting signal speed. Dosage controlled the effect. Straightforward enough.



“The image you hold in your mind is of paramount importance,” Verna continued. “Picture the mana gently pervading the very substance of the brain – not flooding it like a tide, but coating it. Hold fast to the desire for swifter thought, for keener insight.”



Coating it – like a sauce. The warmth of mana climbed up Cole’s body as he pictured it.



“Slowly,” she cautioned. “An excess of mana applied too hastily, or indeed any attempt at enhancement without the proper clearing and attunement first observed – such folly invites a profound disorder of the mind. Confusion gives way to faulty reason, then to sharp distress, and potentially to... convulsions.



Done explaining the theory, Verna walked over to a row of tables set up at the back. Familiar items lay atop each one: chessboards – probably another one of Alexander Celdor’s souvenirs from back home.



“For our initial exercise, therefore, we shall employ a pastime most suited to taxing the intellect – the game of chess. It demands foresight and calculation, and permits us to observe your reasoning whilst under duress. I shall explain –”



“We’re familiar with chess,” Cole clarified.



“Very well. These timing pieces,” she indicated the clocks, “shall allow us to measure the duration of your considerations. Remember, speed is not our chief object this day, nor victory – though I suppose competition wouldn’t hurt. Control, gentlemen. Above all else, control. Ready?”



Cole nodded, the others also confirming. 



Verna paired them off – Cole with Mack, Miles with Ethan. “Enhance your minds, then begin.”



Cole ran through the procedure. After a minute or so, Mack gave him a nod to signal that he was ready. 



Cole reached for the first pawn – e4, opting for a standard King’s Opening that his sister had taught him.



Mack responded immediately, matching the move with e5. There wasn’t *that* much to consider this early on. The cognitive acceleration didn’t really complement his technique, but he could feel it starting to kick in, especially when thinking about the avenues Mack could take next.



Cole advanced his knight. Across the board, Mack played aggressively, slapping the clock faster with each move.



The state felt oddly familiar, like that perfect zone during a firefight – not tunnel vision, but heightened awareness where everything slowed just enough to make better decisions. A flow state – that’s what it was called.



It struck him then how fitting chess was – the chill opening salvos allowed them to ease into it before ramping up in the mid-game. By then, Cole had to consider multiple possible lines all while simultaneously maintaining that mana flow to his brain. The dual focus was the real test; forcing his body to adapt and perform enhancement naturally.



A slight pounding had surfaced, the spell starting to get to him. An ambitious man may have pushed harder, but Cole knew his limits. He decided to simplify, forcing a piece trade rather than optimizing his play. The move wasn’t necessarily optimal chess, but it freed up resources to focus on the enhancement – which, after all, was the actual point of the exercise.



The game continued. Mack gained time advantage through his rapid play, but Cole maintained positional equality. Their relative chess skills remained the primary factor; the enhancement just compressed the thinking time. 



Over time, though, the mana infusion started to feel less like a separate task and more like an extended sense. Not automatic, per se, but integrated – less like juggling two tasks and more like driving while talking. It still demanded attention, but it didn’t require constant context switching anymore.



By the time the board was cleared of most pieces, Cole had gotten relatively used to it. Checkmate came after twenty minutes – him cornering Mack’s king with a knight and a bishop.



“Fuck. Good game, man,” Mack stood, stretching his hand.



“Yeah.” Cole shook his hand and exhaled, “Close one. Think I might need some Aspirin after that one.”



Verna walked up to them. “Not entirely unpleasant, I hope?”



Of all the unpleasant things Cole had to endure back home, this wasn’t even worth a mention. “Wasn’t too bad. Slight headache, but it’s gone now – ever since I stopped casting it.”



Mack nodded. “Could def become second nature with enough practice.”



“Perhaps, should you make a habit of it.” Verna stared at the ongoing match between Miles and Ethan. “In most, the first taste of augmentation provokes appetite – and with it, the impulse to overreach. That you resisted speaks more than you likely intended. Until it becomes ‘second nature’, you shall remain precisely where you are.”



“So what’s next, more chess?” Mack asked.



Verna nodded. “Likely a day or two more. Should you remain steady, we shall begin juggling in due course.” She paused briefly then smiled, probably anticipating what they were just about to ask. “And yes. Its martial uses shall follow thereafter. There exist spells that cannot be attempted without enhancement, save by those with no further use for their faculties.”



Cole grinned. “Can’t wait.”



Verna tilted her head toward Miles and Ethan. “It appears they have concluded their game. We have ample time for several sessions before noon. You shall adhere to the same procedure, merely exchanging opponents.”



Cole swapped seats with Miles, now facing Ethan.



“Ready?” Ethan asked, arranging his pieces.



Cole nodded, closing his eyes to begin the clearing process once more.

My story in a nutshell: I've been dealing with anemia since I was a teen but I didn't know until I was about 30 years old -- all the symptoms went unaddressed during checkups. I was always so tired I could fall asleep sitting up, and I reached a point when my hair was falling out in clumps. This was really scary for me, and I visited multiple doctors and urgent care -- because I was ""young and healthy"" I was told to reduce stress, try yoga, take a prenatal vitamin for hair growth. Finally, a friend told me it might be low iron so I got tested, and lo & behold, I was in rock bottom digits.

Since then, I have been supplementing and it's kind of helped, though I really struggle keeping my iron up and hair shedding is still a thing. Last week I got results showing my ferritin level is 18. My doctor said that's fine and don't worry. Since I'm still having symptoms, I am worried!

Here is what I am currently doing -- I would love any advice for raising my ferritin level!

\-I take Olly ""Delightful Iron"" 28 mg first thing in the morning, 30 minutes before coffee/food

\-I take Gaia Plant Force Liquid Iron 20 mg right before bed. I also take melatonin and CBD at the same time to help with sleep, which might interfere with absorption

I’m 28 and from the UK. Hopefully you're surviving in this heat. British peeps aren't built for the heat lol. 



Now here's my shot at an intro.

Love storytelling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after are all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



I enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. Love tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully along the way, sparks fly and find us.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.

Apparently my family uses me as a psychologist or something, all my family members throw their problems at me, not for me to solve, but to complain, I listen to them and give them advice, solutions, etc. But it's never enough, but I realized that they don't think I'm enough in more aspects of life, behavior, actions, choices, etc. The same does not happen with my cousin, who is the golden girl of my family, she is the same age as me and everything she does is a reason to celebrate and support, she is a really talented drawer, but what is the need to buy three digital tables, a tablet, five cases of complete things, chalk, colored pencils, markers, paints, and leave a drawing of her for 5 years in the same place, recently in a hidden act of revolt, I threw coffee on her drawing and I made a tear, I said I couldn't leave it there anymore, I love her very much, but if her talent cancels out all of mine, my family only knows how to give me lectures, comparisons, hints, and unwanted comments, I'm always the reason for complaints and constant comparison, with the chance I have to vent to one of them, they say it's just nonsense or they just ignore me, I tried to learn how to sew, but my uncle Rodrigo already sewed perfectly while I was still learning, I don't need to say about the attempts I used to draw, I used to sing, until my niece arrived and demonstrated this talent, I also try crocheting but it doesn't work because it takes a LOT of time, I tried a lot of things, but nothing worked, to make up for it I spent my hobbies wanting to work, for a minor this is great, right?

I'm from a Muslim family. I was born in Europe and my parents are from India. I started dating a non-muslim guy in college and they hated me for it. They asked me nicely to leave the guy, and also yelled at me to do it several times. My older brother was on their side. Since I was still living at my parents' house during college, I never disrespected there rules. For example, I was always home around 9pm because they did not want me outside the house afterwards. Sometimes, they were so angry at me, they refused to let me eat diner or lunch when I was home. They even stole some of my scholarship money (they had access to it) because I don't deserve it since I am ""such an awful person"". Anyway, they wanted me to go to see our family in India during summer vacation but something felt fishy. I was dumb enough to accept and what I feared happened : they took my passport and told me I would never go back in Europe unless I marry some Indian guy. I was heartbroken and tried to talk some sense into them. I have friends who would find it odd not to see me come back in September as I was quite a serious student and would never skip class. Since they wouldn't listen, I contacted the embassy so they could help and I managed to find my passport and come back before them in Europe. I took all my shit, stayed at a friends house a few weeks and got a student apartment. 
I did not speak to my parents for more than a year after that incident. They tried to contact me but I blocked them. However, they are my parents and started to miss them so I contacted them. We went to get some coffee and as the day, weeks, months passed we stopped talking about the incident.
Today I have a job, a boyfriend (non Muslim again), a house, a cat, no children (we don't want any) but they still don't like it and judge me for it quite often. On a regular basis, they compare me to my brother who earns more money than me and is ""the only child that truly loves them"" and they can't talk about me to our family in India because there is ""nothing to brag about you"". What I quote is what they actually said multiple times.
I wanted to stop talking to them because I was fed up with all of that. However, my mum had cancer and it made me realise I could lose her any moment and I could not stop talking to my family (bad timing). We all had to help her. 
Her sickness did not soften her. The opposite... So now I don't know what to do. Do I just keep up with every mean stuff they tell or should I just stop and leave? ",1,1752522826.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

They All Quit, and I Refused to Help Him Pay For It.","**My Fiancé Demanded His Groomsmen Spend $2,000 Each on His Bachelor Party. They All Quit, and I Refused to Help Him Pay For It.**

I  thought I was going to marry the man of my dreams. My fiancé, Mark, was everything I’d ever wanted. For three years, he was charming, ambitious, and incredibly loving. We had a great life, a nice apartment, and a shared vision for the future. The moment he proposed under the stars on our anniversary trip, I felt like the luckiest woman alive. The first few months of wedding planning were blissful. We agreed on almost everything, from the venue to the flavor of the cake. It felt like a partnership. I had no idea that a single conversation about his bachelor party would be the first thread to unravel everything.

It started on a Tuesday night. I was on the couch scrolling through Pinterest for centerpiece ideas when Mark sat beside me, his laptop open and a giddy smile on his face.

""Babe, I've figured it out,"" he said, his eyes gleaming. ""The perfect bachelor party.""

""Oh yeah?"" I asked, happy to see him so excited. ""What are you thinking? A weekend camping with the guys? A trip to that brewery you all love?""

He laughed, a sound that in retrospect was more condescending than joyful. ""Think bigger, Sarah. Much bigger. Five days. All-inclusive luxury resort in Ibiza.""

I blinked, processing the words. Ibiza. That was... a lot. ""Wow, Mark. That sounds amazing. And expensive. Can the guys afford that?""

His smile tightened slightly. ""It's a once-in-a-lifetime event. It's not about the money, it's about the experience. I've already done the math. If everyone pitches in, it'll only be about $2,000 each. Flights, hotel, everything.""

The number hung in the air like a bad smell. Two thousand dollars. I knew for a fact that his best man, Dave, and his wife were saving up for a down payment on a house. Another groomsman, Kevin, had just had a baby.

""Honey,"" I said gently, trying to choose my words carefully. ""That's a huge amount of money to ask people to spend. That's more than a month's rent for some of them. Are you sure they'd be okay with that?""

""They're my best friends,"" he said, shutting his laptop with a definitive snap. ""Of course, they'll be okay with it. They'd do anything for me. You're worrying for nothing.""

He created a group chat that night and laid out his grand plan. The silence in the chat was deafening.

The first call came two days later. It was Dave, the best man. He sounded incredibly awkward and stressed.

""Hey, Sarah... is Mark around?"" he asked. ""No, he's at the gym. What's up?"" He let out a heavy sigh. ""Look, about this Ibiza trip... there's just no way. I can't do it. We talked it over, and none of us can. We tried to talk to Mark, but he's not listening. We were thinking we could plan something awesome for him closer to home, but he called it a 'pathetic consolation prize'. Sarah, we love Mark, but $2,000 is insane. I'm sorry.""

One by one, they all dropped out, each with a polite but firm 'no'.

When I told Mark, he exploded. It was a side of him I’d never seen before. The charming, easy-going man I loved was replaced by a furious stranger.

""They're just jealous!"" he seethed, pacing our living room. ""They're jealous that I'm successful, that I'm getting married. Cheap, jealous cowards, the lot of them.""

""They're not jealous, Mark, they're your friends with real-life financial responsibilities!"" I argued, my voice rising. ""This isn't fair!""

That's when he turned on me. His eyes were cold. ""The problem, Sarah, is that you're not on my side. You're supposed to support me. This is the most important event of my life before I get married, and you're siding with them.""

I was stunned into silence. Before I could even respond, he delivered the final blow.

""If my friends are too broke to make my dream a reality, then you should help,"" he said, his voice dangerously calm. ""You have your savings for the wedding decor. Use that. Pay for me. Hell, pay for Dave and Kevin too, so they don't have an excuse. If you really loved me, you'd want me to have this.""

I stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest. He wanted me to take the money I had carefully saved from my own salary—money meant for our shared future—to fund his ridiculously extravagant party after his friends had wisely refused. He wasn't asking. He was demanding.

I found my voice, and it was as cold as his had been. ""No.""

""What?"" he scoffed, disbelief on his face.

""No,"" I repeated, a strange sense of clarity washing over me. ""I will not pay for it. Not one single cent. It's a completely unreasonable and selfish demand, and I'm not going to enable it.""

The look on his face was not one of love or disappointment. It was pure, unfiltered rage. That night, for the first time, I didn't see my future husband. I saw a total stranger. And I started to wonder what other ugly truths he was hiding behind that charming smile. That single ""no"" was the beginning of the end, and the first step toward uncovering a betrayal that was far worse than just a fight over money.

The week after our fight was the coldest I’ve ever experienced. We lived like ghosts in our own apartment, the silence thick with resentment. Mark’s charm was gone, replaced by a sullen, passive-aggressive mood. He’d make little comments designed to guilt me. “Had to cancel the booking today. The guy at the resort sounded so disappointed for me,” or “Dave is still trying to get me to go to some cheap cabin in the woods. Guess that’s all I’m worth to people.” I refused to take the bait. The man I knew would have understood his friends’ financial situations. This new Mark was entitled, manipulative, and it was unnerving.

His phone, once casually left on the coffee table, was now his constant companion. He’d sit on the couch, angled away from me, a smirk occasionally playing on his lips as he texted. The secrecy was a new and ugly development in our relationship. I kept replaying his words in my head: ""This is the most important event of my life before I get married."" Why? Why was a party more important than the feelings of his fiancée and his closest friends? A dark suspicion began to bloom in the back of my mind, a suspicion I was too afraid to name.

The confirmation I didn't know I was looking for came on a Friday night. Mark announced he was going out for drinks, a bitter edge to his voice as he said, “Since I don’t have any *real* friends left, I’m meeting up with a guy from work.” He showered, put on his most expensive shirt, and doused himself in cologne—far more effort than a casual work drink required. He left his iPad on the arm of the couch as he walked out.

An hour later, as I was mindlessly watching TV, the iPad screen lit up. It was a notification banner at the top of the screen.

**Chloe 💋: Can’t wait for you to ditch the fiancée and have a real party with me in Ibiza 😉**

My blood ran cold. Chloe. I’d seen that name before. A few weeks ago, she’d left a fire emoji on one of Mark’s old Instagram photos. When I’d asked who she was, he’d brushed it off as “just some random colleague.”

The message wasn’t ambiguous. It wasn't a misunderstanding. It was a confirmation of my deepest fear. For a moment, I just stared at the screen, my heart hammering against my ribs. I had never, ever snooped on a partner. I believed trust was the foundation of everything. But his entitlement, the fight over the money, the secrecy—he had bulldozed that foundation long before I picked up his iPad. My hands were shaking, but I unlocked it. His messages were synced from his phone.

My eyes scanned the list of conversations until I found it: a group chat named “MARKY’S IBIZA BLOWOUT 🎉”. It included Dave, Kevin, and his other groomsmen. The chat started a month ago. With a deep breath, I started reading from the beginning.

The first few messages were just Mark, hyping up the trip. Then, the guys’ hesitant replies started to come in. **Dave:** *Dude this looks epic but 2k is a bit out of my league right now with the house deposit.* **Kevin:** *Yeah man, with baby number 2 on the way, my wife would literally kill me lol.*

Mark’s replies were infuriating. **Mark:** *Stop being poor for 5 minutes and live a little. This is my last ride as a single man. You’re supposed to make it legendary.*

But that was nothing. As I scrolled further, I found the private messages between him and another friend, one who wasn’t in the main group. This was where the real Mark lived.

**Mark:** *They’re all backing out. Bunch of broke, whipped losers.* **Friend:** *Told you 2k was too much.* **Mark:** *It was a test. If they can’t hang, I don’t want them there. Besides, the main event isn’t about them anyway. Chloe’s already getting her ticket.* **Friend:** *You’re actually going through with that? You’re about to get married!* **Mark:** *Bro, I need one last story to tell. Sarah is great, she’s stable, she’s the perfect future wife. But she’s… safe. Boring. I need one more week of fun before I settle into that life. Chloe’s the opposite of safe.*

I felt the air leave my lungs. Stable. Safe. Boring. He was using me for a comfortable life, and planning to have one last hurrah before locking it down. But the worst was yet to come. I switched back to the main groomsmen chat, scrolling to the messages sent right after our big fight, when he was trying to convince them to come back.

**Dave:** *Mark, we’re sorry, but we just can’t. Can’t we do Vegas for a weekend? Something more reasonable?* **Mark:** *No. Don't you get it? This is my standard now. I’m not some college kid drinking cheap beer in a dirty casino. I’m moving up.* **Mark:** *And don't worry about the money too much. If I have to, I’ll just squeeze it out of Sarah. She’s got a fat savings account she barely touches. She’s obsessed with the wedding, she’ll pay up to keep me happy. She’s my golden goose. Just gotta play the loving fiancé for a little longer.*

*Golden goose.*

The words swam in front of my eyes. This wasn't just about a stupid, overpriced party. This wasn't just about a potential one-night stand in Ibiza. This was his fundamental view of me. I wasn't his partner; I was his sponsor. I wasn't the love of his life; I was a ""safe"" and ""boring"" stepping stone to the lifestyle he felt he deserved.

The shock slowly subsided, replaced by something I’d never felt before: a cold, methodical rage. There were no tears. My hands stopped shaking. My vision became crystal clear. I picked up my own phone and, with meticulous precision, I photographed every single incriminating message. The plans with Chloe. The insults about his ""best friends."" And most importantly, the disgusting, unforgivable things he had said about me.

I saved the photos to a secure folder. I closed the iPad and placed it exactly where he had left it. I turned off the TV and sat in the quiet, dark living room. The woman who had been excitedly planning a wedding just a week ago was gone. In her place was a woman with a file of evidence and a burning desire for justice.

When Mark stumbled through the door at 2 AM, smelling of expensive alcohol and false confidence, he looked at me in the dark and sneered. ""Sitting in the dark? Are you finally realizing how stupid this fight is? Have you come to your senses about helping me out?""

I looked at him, the man who was a complete stranger to me, and gave him a small, calm smile. ""Yes,"" I said. ""I think I have.""

He had no idea. He thought he was winning. He didn't know that I had just read the final chapter of our relationship, and was now preparing to write an epilogue of my own. His comeuppance wasn't going to be a simple argument. It was going to be a performance.

For two days, I played the part of the dutiful, apologetic fiancée. I let Mark believe he had won. I told him he was right, that his happiness was important, and that I had overreacted. His smugness was almost unbearable, but I held on to the images on my phone like a secret shield. To make my act believable, I told him that before I committed my savings, I wanted to get our parents together for dinner. I framed it as a way to ""clear the air"" and ""present a united front.""

Mark loved the idea. In his narcissistic mind, he saw a scene where I would publicly capitulate to his demands, reinforcing his victory in front of the people who mattered most. He thought he was walking into a coronation. He was actually walking into an execution.

We met at a quiet, upscale restaurant—neutral territory. His parents, a stern-looking but fair couple, and my own warm but protective parents were all there. The air was thick with polite tension. After the appetizers, Mark's father cleared his throat.

""So,"" he began, looking between us. ""Mark mentioned there was a... slight disagreement about the wedding plans. I'm sure we can sort it out.""

This was Mark's cue. He launched into his well-rehearsed performance, painting himself as the victim. He spoke of his ""dream trip,"" the ""betrayal"" of his friends, and my ""initial hesitation."" He then took my hand across the table, his touch making my skin crawl.

""But I'm happy to say,"" he said, beaming at everyone, ""that Sarah has come around. She sees how important this is to me. She's agreed to help me make it happen because she knows our love is stronger than any little fight over money.""

All eyes turned to me. His mother smiled, relieved. My dad looked skeptical. This was my moment.

I slowly pulled my hand from his grasp and left it on the table. ""You're right about one thing, Mark,"" I said, my voice perfectly calm and even. ""I do understand everything now. I understand why you were so desperate to go to Ibiza. And I know exactly who you were planning to meet there.""

Mark's smile faltered. ""What are you talking about?""

I picked up my phone. ""First, let's talk about your 'betrayal' by your friends."" I turned my phone to face his parents. ""This is what you called Dave, your best man since childhood, for not wanting to spend two thousand dollars he didn't have."" I showed them the screenshot where Mark called his friends ""broke, whipped losers."" His father’s eyebrows shot up.

""And this,"" I continued, my voice unwavering, ""is why you needed a 'last wild ride.' Because you find your future wife to be 'safe and boring'."" I showed them the messages about me, about my personality. My own mother gasped, her hand flying to her mouth.

Mark's face had gone from smug to pale. ""Sarah, this is not the time or place...""

""Oh, I think it is,"" I said, cutting him off. ""This is the perfect place. Because you wanted our families to be here when I agreed to pay for your trip. It's only fair they're here for the truth."" I looked at his mother, whose eyes were welling up. ""Your son wasn't just planning a trip. He was planning to cheat on me with a woman named Chloe."" I showed them the explicit messages, the winking emojis, the plans for their ""private party.""

I saved the best for last. I put my phone down and looked directly into Mark's terrified eyes.

""But the real reason I'm not paying for your trip, and the real reason there will be no wedding, isn't just the cheating or the insults,"" I announced to the silent table. ""It's because I finally know what you truly think of me.""

I let the moment hang in the air, then delivered the final, fatal blow. ""You told your friend you would 'squeeze the money out of me' because, and I quote, 'She's my golden goose. Just gotta play the loving fiancé for a little longer'.""

The silence was shattered by my father pushing his chair back violently. Mark's mother was openly crying now, whispering ""No, Mark, no."" His father stared at him with a look of pure, cold disgust.

Mark just sat there, mouth agape, utterly defeated and exposed.

I stood up. With a quiet 'click', I unclasped the engagement ring from my finger and placed it on the table next to my untouched glass of wine.

""The wedding is off,"" I said clearly. ""You can keep the ring. Maybe you can sell it. Consider it a contribution towards your trip.""

With my parents flanking me like a protective guard, I turned and walked out of the restaurant without looking back.

The aftermath was exactly as you’d expect. A flood of texts from Mark, ranging from pathetic, misspelled apologies to furious accusations. I blocked him on everything. His parents sent me a long, heartfelt letter of apology for their son's behavior. Dave and Kevin reached out, too. Once they heard the full story, they were horrified. They apologized for not seeing the real Mark sooner, and we actually ended up becoming friends.

As for me, I took the money I had saved—my ""golden goose"" fund—and booked a trip for one. I went to Italy, ate incredible food, saw beautiful art, and remembered who I was without him. Refusing to pay for that party was the best decision of my life. It wasn't about the two thousand dollars. It was about my self-worth, and it turns out that's priceless.",0,1752522760.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.29,False

Tired of feeling like your competitors are hogging all the online attention? Wish your website popped up higher in Google search results? You're not alone! Many US-based small businesses struggle to get noticed online, but the good news is, you don't need a massive marketing budget to climb the ranks. Let's dive into some free SEO tools and strategies that can help you dominate your niche, one search query at a time.

**The Challenge:**

Let's face it, the internet is a crowded place. As a small business owner in the US, competing against established brands and deep-pocketed competitors can feel overwhelming. You have a great product or service, but getting it in front of the right audience through search engines requires knowledge, strategy, and a bit of elbow grease. Many entrepreneurs avoid SEO because they think it’s too technical, expensive, or time-consuming. But the truth is, a solid SEO foundation is crucial for sustainable growth, and you *can* build it yourself without breaking the bank.

**Unleash Your Inner SEO Ninja: A Practical Guide**

Here's a blueprint for using free tools and smart strategies to boost your website's visibility and attract more customers:

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Keyword Research – Find Your Goldmine**
    * **Identify your target audience:** Who are you trying to reach? What are their pain points?
    * **Brainstorm relevant keywords:** Think about the words and phrases your ideal customers would use when searching for your product or service. Tools can help refine your thinking here!
    * **Use a free keyword research tool:** Google Keyword Planner (requires a Google Ads account but you don't have to run ads!), Ubersuggest, and AnswerThePublic are excellent starting points.
    * **Analyze search volume and competition:** Aim for keywords with a decent search volume (enough people are searching for them) but lower competition (it will be easier to rank). Long-tail keywords (longer, more specific phrases) are often a sweet spot. Example: Instead of ""coffee,"" try ""best fair trade coffee Seattle.""
    * **Pro-Tip:** Don’t just focus on product keywords. Include informational keywords. Someone searching “how to brew pour over coffee” might be a good lead for your coffee business!

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: On-Page Optimization – Make Your Website SEO-Friendly**
    * **Optimize your title tags and meta descriptions:** These are the snippets that appear in search results. Make them compelling and include your target keywords.
    * **Use header tags (H1, H2, H3) to structure your content:** Use H1 for the main headline, H2 for subheadings, and so on. This helps search engines understand the hierarchy of your page.
    * **Write high-quality, engaging content:** Create content that is informative, valuable, and addresses the needs of your audience. Aim for readability and natural keyword usage.
    * **Optimize images with alt text:** Describe your images using relevant keywords. This helps search engines understand what the images are about and improves accessibility.
    * **Ensure your website is mobile-friendly:** Most searches happen on mobile devices. Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test to check your site.
    * **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Imagine you sell handmade jewelry. Instead of a title tag like ""Jewelry,"" try ""Handmade Silver Earrings - Unique Designs | [Your Business Name]"". Your meta description might be: ""Shop handcrafted silver earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. Unique designs made with love. Free shipping on orders over $50!""

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Local SEO – Get Found in Your Neighborhood**
    * **Claim and optimize your Google My Business (GMB) profile:** This is crucial for local search. Fill out all the information accurately, including your address, phone number, website, hours of operation, and services offered.
    * **Encourage customers to leave reviews:** Positive reviews can significantly improve your ranking in local search results.
    * **List your business in relevant online directories:** Yelp, Yellow Pages, and industry-specific directories can help increase your visibility.
    * **Use local keywords throughout your website:** Include your city and state in your content, title tags, and meta descriptions.
    * **Pro-Tip:** Regularly update your GMB profile with posts about new products, services, and special offers.

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Link Building – Earn Authority**
    * **Create valuable content that others want to link to:** Blog posts, infographics, and videos are all great options.

Ok, so from what I can *recall*, the candy came in really long thin plastic tubes. Think as thin as those plastic coffee stirrers, but thinner plastic, and like 2 feet long, maybe longer. They were filled with a sweet/spicy powder. The way I remember eating them, as well as all the kids around me would eat them, is you would bite off a 1-2” piece, plastic and all. You’d chew the plastic and kinda suck and chew on it until you got all the candy out. Then you’d spit out the chewed up plastic remnant. Rinse and repeat 🤣 I also remember that the candy would sometimes have several colors layered in the long thin tube, like red, yellow, green. Or sometimes they’d be all red.

Quarter to five, Mike sat patiently at his desk, the towering skyscrapers outside his window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards were the only sounds that broke the otherwise stifling silence. He worked a normal nine to five at a small office department, no wife or kids, and monthly paid rent on an overpriced apartment. In every meaning of the word, Mike could be described as just an average guy. What the outside eye misses is the intricacies and characteristics of every human being, as specific as they all are, are too much to ever define a person as, “Average.” Mike had his fair share of oddities, ones he tried to hide, like us all. He had many dreams, which you couldn’t see through the way he lived his life, and he wasn't the type to share them. Mike's work life was quite unintriguing, and not all of that was necessarily due to Mike.  Each morning, colleagues shuffled in, their faces blank, their greetings automated. They moved like clockwork, pouring identical cups of coffee, settling into the same worn chairs, their actions devoid of spontaneity. Their work life was a relentless hamster wheel, a futile chase after a carrot forever dangling just out of reach. Each day bled into the next, an endless cycle of monotony that led nowhere and to nothing. Mike would leave his work parking lot at almost the exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. He would then take a few left and right turns until he got to the auditorium. The auditorium screamed with neglect, its faded velvet seats ripped and stained, the air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams. But to Mike, it pulsed with possibility, each broken chair a testament to the magic it once held within its walls. He had been working for this moment for months and months, imagining and replaying his dream over and over again in his head. It became his driving force, completely infatuated with his dream, the dream of being a magician. It was an odd dream, not shared by many. Interest sparked in Mike at a young age, his seventh birthday party, and in which his parents hired a magician. The magician put on a fantastic show, loud applause rained from both him and all of his classmates that his mother had invited. In that moment Mike knew what he wanted, and it never changed. Even if we deny it, or are scared to admit it, it's what we all deep down inside want and crave. The dream of being something special. For Mike, he planned this his whole life. Before he went to sleep, while he was asleep dreaming, sitting in the back of class, all Mike ever imagined to do was to have an audience cheer him on, and give him the same affection that they did that magician at his seventh birthday party. If this could just go right for Mike this time, everything would be alright, it would all be fixed. The show began, presented by Mikey the magic man. Afee, a few basic introduction tricks the audience clapped, but not at the tone he remembered. He thinks back to the only way he could really impress them, he must put all his chips on the table and go for the prestige. This act would make or break Mike's show, and in reality his life as well. Mike pivoted quickly, and remembered the act that wowed his classmates so long ago, the infamous saw act. It was fairly simple, one he had practiced many times over and over in his head. All he would have to do is saw a woman in half and put her back together. The trick had been done many times by others, and for a magician of Mike's caliber should be inconsequential. The first cut was clean, the body was split into halves. Mike glanced at the crowd, expecting applause, but met only silence. Faces contorted in disgust, eyes burning with a hatred he couldn't comprehend. A cold dread washed over him. Had he miscalculated? What went wrong? Excruciatingly, he looks back onto the stage.  Every fiber in his body felt empty, like he was stuck in this moment for decades. What had once been complete, then broken, was entirely incomplete now. Her body laid lifeless, guts falling onto the stage, Mike immediately covers his face to mask the smell of a rotting corpse, as he loosens his ever tight grip of the saw, dropping it right into his victims still-pumping heart. As he turns away towards the audience, they start to scream and concurrently trash the stage. He begs and pleads for forgiveness, but is met with a pure moment of anarchy. All that was once slow, was now racing around and nothing makes sense. Did anything ever make sense? Or was the discontentment masked by the revolving door.  Mike scans around the room and trembles in fear. The dream was over, he would wake up soon but the show could not go on. Even after the chaos, it couldn't be the same. Mike dropped down to the floor, sobbing and screaming in agony. Despair consuming him, he clawed at his scalp, tufts of hair scattering like fallen leaves. Then, with a gut wrenching scream, he gouged at his eyes, the vibrant blue fading into a bloody mess. He tore at his skin, desperate to shed the weight of his failure, until finally, only the stark, white bones of his shattered dreams remained on his decrepit body. His mangled skeleton figure laid there on stage, still being trashed by the crowd, greasy popcorn and flat soda covered his remains. Mike had reduced himself down into nothing and nobody.

8:37 am. Then came nine. Programmed, programmed to come in, say the same things, drink the same coffee, sit in the same seat, and do the same unimportant work every single day. A hamster wheel back and forth, futilely chasing at something that can never be obtained. Mike would leave his work parking lot at the same exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. Nothing compares to childhood innocence, fever dreams, a fading memory. A revolving door never stops its orbit, until you step out.",1,1752522471.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I will say, I LOVE their first kiss in the coffee shop but for me, I could not really feel the same about them around the start of season 6. She realizes she's in love with him, flies to London the day before his wedding, he sees her and says *her* name during his vows.... and then when she confesses her feelings to him back home, she immediately backtracks it and laughs it off and they don't pursue each other. To me, that would have been such an iconic way to reignite the pairing.

The more I rewatch, the more that part just feels so off to me. There was so much building and tension and it seems like it will be *their* moment, but instead the writers dropped it to drag out the will they/won't they.

1lzweg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lzweg1/explore_if_the_home_hero_french_press_coffee/,Explore if the Home Hero French Press Coffee Maker delivers ultimate brewing satisfaction review,"**Stylish and Functional Design**  
The Home Hero HHKA0107 French Press Coffee Maker instantly stood out to me with its sleek, modern appearance. The bamboo handle brings warmth, while the stainless-steel accents add sophistication, making it a statement piece for any kitchen. I genuinely appreciated the ml/oz markings on the heat-resistant borosilicate glass—perfect for ensuring precise measurements during those early mornings when caffeine is a must. This French press doesn’t just perform well; it looks good doing it. While aesthetics may not contribute to coffee flavor, it certainly feels more satisfying to use a device that’s easy on the eyes.  

**Convenience Meets Effective Brewing**  
This coffee press makes brewing almost feel like an art form. The 34-ounce capacity is ideal for hosting guests or indulging in a larger batch for a long workday. I experimented with both coarse and medium-ground coffee, and the results were consistently rich and smooth. Its manual operation connects you more closely with the coffee brewing process. I even managed to whip up some solid iced coffee using the specific instructions in the manual. The reusable filter adds a touch of eco-friendliness, which I always try to prioritize when choosing kitchen tools.

[Ready to buy Home Hero HHKA0107? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d6b73b4w/)  

**Perks**  
- Beautiful bamboo handle paired with stainless steel reinforces durability.  
- Four-layer filtration ensures an incredibly smooth and ground-free brew.    
- Marking measurements on the side of the glass save time and guesswork.  

**High-Quality Materials for Longevity**  
Over time, I've learned that investing in materials makes a difference, and this French press doesn’t compromise. The 304 stainless steel frame not only makes the unit more robust but also keeps your coffee hotter for longer. I noticed that even after 20 minutes, it was still warm! Adding to its construction, the borosilicate glass doesn’t stain or retain flavors from previous brews. This is great because I like switching things up between black coffee, chicory brews, and even loose-leaf teas.  

**Positives**  
- Robust and heat-resistant borosilicate glass.  
- Keeps coffee warmer compared to standard glass models.  
- Anti-slip silicone base is a lifesaver when working with slippery counters.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleanup—because who really wants more dishes?  

**Weaknesses**  
- While the bamboo handle is gorgeous, it needs careful hand washing to avoid wear over time.  
- Not ideal for people who prefer automatic coffee makers or require faster preparation.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
The daily grind (pun intended) of using this press didn’t overwhelm me, thanks to its easy-cleaning design. The dishwasher-safe glass canister is the hero here; I could toss it into the top rack without worries. That said, I took extra care hand-washing the stainless steel frame and bamboo handle. These small actions were worth preserving the product’s sharp look. Staying on top of regular cleaning also ensured that my coffee tasted as good as day one.

**Product Competitors**  
While the Home Hero French Press has its bragging rights, I couldn’t resist comparing it to classics like the Bodum Chambord. Admittedly, the Bodum models are more minimalistic, but they fall short on warmth retention compared to the stainless steel frame here. Another alternative I explored was the Espro Press P7, which is considerably pricier but offers a tighter filtration system. That said, for its price point, this French press holds its ground, providing excellent build quality and user satisfaction.  

**Value Proposition**  
You're essentially paying for a coffee maker and an aesthetic upgrade. While you may find cheaper options, very few have the same attention to detail and design elements that this model delivers. The anti-slip silicone base, in particular, justifies why this item feels polished and premium. Whether replacing an outdated press or starting fresh, I’d say it’s worth exploring the features that elevate your home brewing experience.

The idea is to facilitate in person connections, as they will check on the map and see who's building nearby.

What happened though people added themselves to promote their products. This was happening because of the website copy and also the pricing plan (you pay to have your avatar visible). It made me $200 in the first 2 weeks.

I was excited. Founders are enjoying my product!

But the problem was: founders were not coming back to the website, so, this revenue would be one-off and would not grow as much.

Then, after conversations with them, I decided to focus on founders meeting other founders in person. This way, there was a reason for back to the website.

I changed the copy and implemented the notifications feature, where they receive emails if someone close to them is open for a coffee. After those changes: I've made $0 and also, only a few founders have joined.

Now, I'm testing this hypothesis of ""founders/digital nomads want to meet in person"".

I have 2 things in mind:

1. ⁠Should I roll back to the previous model (product's promotion) and double down on that?
2. ⁠Keep trying to validate the hypothesis? But I don't know how.

Would very much appreciate feedback here. Thank you.

His name does not ring a bell, nor do I recall ever working with him directly in any meaningful or collaborative capacity.

At the court’s request, my team reviewed archival project logs and identified a ‘Stephen Hilton’ listed among numerous temporary contract workers who provided support at Remote Control Productions. These roles involved technical tasks such as music programming or minor arrangements, functions which are several steps removed from the core creative process. They do not involve collaboration with me personally.

To be clear, Mr. Hilton has never co-composed a score with me. He was not a creative partner, nor was he part of my inner scoring circle. I did not ask him to move to the United States, nor do I have any memory of inviting him to join my team in such a capacity.

While I respect the work done by all contributors, Mr. Hilton’s role was peripheral at best. Suggesting he was my co-composer or close collaborator is like a barista claiming they co-authored a novel because they served coffee to the writer.

If he truly believes we shared some kind of artistic partnership, I would gently suggest that reality and self-perception may not be fully aligned.”

My 57-year-old mother has been struggling with psychotic symptoms since the COVID pandemic started. She's been hospitalized three times, and each time she was prescribed medication, but she refuses to take it consistently. My father and I have been bearing the brunt of her daily care and managing her life, which is incredibly draining.

About a year and a half ago, she stopped taking her prescribed medication: 150mg Venlafaxine in the morning, 10mg Olanzapine in the morning, and 10mg Olanzapine in the evening. I knew that suddenly stopping these medications could cause severe issues, and she refuses to see a doctor.

In an act of desperation, my father and I have been secretly putting 150mg of Venlafaxine and 10mg of Olanzapine (the morning dose) into her coffee every day. We've been giving her the evening dose of Olanzapine (10mg) around 3 PM or 5 PM.

Since she stopped taking her meds (and even with our secret attempts to reintroduce them), her negative psychotic symptoms have become severe. She's significantly impaired and has a drastically distorted perception of reality. She often trembles uncontrollably, especially in both hands, and has developed a severe tremor. She seems completely out of it, talks to herself, and often says things like ""it will reach,"" but can't explain what she means.

I've tried everything to get her help. The police, ambulance, and emergency services all tell me they can't intervene unless there's blood. I feel like I'm completely on my own trying to manage her medication and her condition.

My questions for you are:

Could all of these symptoms (the severe tremors, impaired reality, talking to herself) be due to the medication or the way we're administering it, especially the abrupt changes and our covert actions?

Should I try to slowly taper her off the medication we're giving her?

Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to get a loved one medical help when they refuse it?

Are there any legal avenues I can pursue to get her involuntary treatment, given her severe impairment and refusal to see a doctor? I'm in Germany, if that helps.

When I turned 10, I had my first migraine with aura. Those have gone away as I aged (39M), but they have been replaced by a constant, non-stop, every-second-of-every-day tension headache for the past 15 years or so.

Nothing has ever helped, and I've tried everything.

However, I have a hypothesis that my headaches are caused by my caffeine abuse (regularly 1g per day), which stem from abuse of Excedrin through most of my life and heavy coffee use. To that end, I wanted to document my journey to going caffeine free. I don't know if it will help, but like I've said, there is almost nothing left for me to try. I wanted to keep track of how things are going, both to give myself an objective way to track, as well as in case someone else is in the same boat.

I found a sealed envelope addressed to someone at Stanford West Apartments while passing by the area recently. I brought it to the leasing office, but they wouldn’t accept it since it was missing the full unit number.

Unfortunately, I’m no longer in the vicinity and can’t deliver it myself. I was wondering if anyone at Stanford would be willing to help by sending a brief email to the intended recipient — just saying you found the envelope outside Stanford West, brought it to the leasing office, and they turned it away. I can provide the exact message to send (super short, nothing personal), and if they respond, I’ll mail you the envelope directly so you can pass it on.

I know this is an unusual request, but it would mean a lot. Happy to cover postage or buy you a coffee in thanks. Please DM me if you’re in the area and open to helping!",1,1752521458.0,stanford,8,0.66,False

My presentation is very androgynous, I identify as a trans tomboy so I don't normally wear makeup and tend to dress pretty boyish. As such, I'd say I basically boy mode but I also don't try hard to hide my curves. So folks get confused a lot, and frankly I confuse myself sometimes too. 

Anyway, today was a pretty bad dysphoria day. I cut myself shaving this morning and didn't sleep well and was just feeling pretty down and dysphoric on my way to work. 

I stopped to grab coffee on the way to work, and while waiting in line this older lady walked up and started making comments about my many visible tattoos. She was kinda nice at first but then proceeded to start talking about how she thinks it's ""inappropriate for ladies to have so many tattoos."" I brushed her off and told her to mind her own business and she just walked off looking offended. 

THEN, on the way out I get called ""ma'am"" by a man who held the door for me. I'm just in a t shirt and jeans! WTF! 

It's weird being an on/off passing trans tomboy, I think I fall into this trap a lot where I nitpick my own appearance and get so harsh and critical towards my presentation.

The moment the blue flame-engulfed spearhead pierced Kraken's body, I knew.

""It's over.""

Slash! Boom! The cut was followed by an internal explosion of fiery energy.

The head of the monster, which was over ten meters long, burst like a balloon, and blue blood that hadn't yet evaporated rained down onto the sea surface.

And in the next moment.

Crash— Along with the massive body of the falling Kraken, a clear bell sound echoed in my ears.

Ding.

* You have defeated \[Lv.140 'King of the Black Sea, Kraken\]!
* You have gained a large amount of experience points!
* \[Mandokjihwan\] has detoxified all the poisons in your body!
* The status effect, \[Poisoned\], has been removed!
* The status effect, \[Paralyzed\], has been removed!

Despite the System notification that Kraken had been defeated, my mouth felt as dry as if I had chewed on sand.

""Damn it."" I should have kept it alive. I should have found out its true identity somehow.

But a moment of carelessness led to an irreversible outcome, and Kraken died, leaving behind an unsolved mystery.

If it had attacked me directly, there might have been a chance...

""It's too late now."" Kraken was smarter than I had anticipated.

It knew that even in my poisoned state, I was stronger than it was, and it realized it couldn't escape.

So, it targeted the survivors instead of me. It chose to die rather than be captured.

In the face of Kraken's final desperate struggle, I had only one choice left.

""...Sigh.""

I sighed as I looked at Kraken's half-submerged corpse on the sea surface.

It was an unavoidable choice. If I hadn't killed it in one blow, someone would have died right in front of me. The saying ""sacrifice the few for the many"" sounds nice, but in essence, it's still a sacrifice, and allowing unnecessary deaths when you have the power to prevent them is just negligence.

""I should have stayed vigilant until the end... but it's already spilled milk.""

I felt uneasy and regretful about not uncovering the mastermind behind it all, but I didn't regret killing Kraken.

There were people who survived because of my choice.

""Hey, over here! Please save us!"" ""Cough! Please, save my child...!"" ""Mom! Mom!""

Thanks to fighting as far away as possible, hundreds of casualties occurred before I could even arrive, but there were still more survivors waiting to be rescued.

Hearing the desperate cries of people from the collapsing Gwangandaegyo Bridge and the churning sea, I forced myself to shake off my fatigue and sprang into action.

Whoosh! The salty and refreshing sea breeze filled my nostrils.

I became a gust of wind, skimming across the water's surface.

Reaching the people beyond Kraken's floating corpse, I quickly pulled them up and urged them.

""It's dangerous, so stay here. Those who can, please help me rescue others.""

The relatively unscathed young man spat out water and opened his mouth.

""Cough. But we still need to escape to another place...""

""Escape?""

""Y-Yes."" He raised his hand and pointed somewhere. Black smoke was rising between the dense forest of buildings.

Ordinary civilians couldn't hear it, but with my heightened senses, I already knew.

* Ssssss!
* Tanker! Advance three steps!
* The building is collapsing! Civilians are in danger!
* Aaaah!

Faint screams and loud noises could be heard. It was evidence that a street battle between humans and monsters was taking place not far away.

And it was happening simultaneously in various nearby locations.

""Monsters are waiting everywhere. Do you still want to go?""

""...No. I'll stay here.""

At least he understood quickly.

Even though the Kraken was dead, it wasn't over yet.

To completely quell this chaos, I would have to spend the entire day very busily.

Swoosh, boom!

As I leaped off the water's surface, the survivors stared at me in a daze.

Everyone eats.

But it's undeniable that the formality of a meal changes depending on who you're eating with and where.

In that sense, today's meal between just two people was quite formal.

The late-starting breakfast, accompanied by a leisurely conversation, lasted for two hours, and by the time it ended, a beautifully decorated dessert had been placed on the white tablecloth.

""I prepared rice cake soup for the upcoming New Year... I hope it suited your taste, Team Leader Choi.""

With a polite yet gentle voice, Choi Minwoo wiped his mouth with a napkin and spoke.

""Thanks to your consideration, President, it was very delicious.""

""Haha. I'm glad to hear that.""

The middle-aged man sitting across from him, President Baek Han-seong, continued with a warm smile.

""You've been so busy lately that I thought you might not be eating properly. So, I asked our Blue House chef to take special care since you are an important guest.""

The term ""important guest"" was not just an empty phrase.

Being invited to a breakfast at the Blue House already indicated that one was a significant figure, but a meal shared between just two people had a special meaning.

It meant that President Baek Han-seong considered Choi Minwoo very important.

""It's good to see you eating well. It makes me feel proud.""

Choi Minwoo bowed his head slightly.

""Thank you. But I don't think I've been skipping meals as much as you think, so I feel like I've caused you unnecessary worry.""

""Oh, really? Well, I suppose you have your own personal chef too.""

""No, there's someone who takes care of my meals these days.""

""Someone who takes care of your meals... Ah, could it be?""

Choi Minwoo nodded slightly.

""Jin Taekyung's mother prepares my meals.""

""Wow, your mother herself?""

""Yes. I refused because it didn't seem right, but she was very insistent.""

President Baek Han-seong let out a small exclamation.

He already knew that Jin Taekyung's family was temporarily staying at Choi Minwoo's mansion, but hearing it directly from the person involved gave it a different significance.

'If she's even taking care of his meals... they're closer than I thought.' Jin Taekyung and Choi Minwoo. Choi Minwoo and Jin Taekyung.

To President Baek Han-seong, these two were not only big fish he couldn't afford to lose but also the only solution to counter the immense influence of the Ares Guild.

With the highly esteemed Jin Taekyung and Choi Minwoo, the grandson and only blood relative of Cheon Taemin, he could rise to an even higher position.

Following his tenure as the youngest president of South Korea, there was a good chance he could become the first re-elected president under the new laws.

'No matter what, I must make those two my people.' While President Baek Han-seong was lost in his political thoughts, Choi Minwoo was sipping his coffee, thinking about something entirely different.

'The dinner she said she'd make tonight... was it kimchi stew?' It was strange. Despite just finishing a meal, he felt an emptiness in his stomach.

He found himself craving the kimchi stew made by Jin Taekyung's mother more than the rice cake soup meticulously prepared by the Blue House chef, renowned as the best in Korean cuisine.

Perfectly cooked white rice from a pressure cooker, tender pork, and well-fermented kimchi.

And people sitting around the table, eating together with gusto.

'Huh?'

Choi Minwoo chuckled softly as he realized something about himself.

'So that's what it is.'

He didn't particularly like rice cake soup or kimchi stew.

The reason he looked forward to dinner wasn't because her cooking was better than the Blue House chef's.

It was simply... he liked the atmosphere. The warm food, shared with warm people.

'Home.'

And family.

To Choi Minwoo, those two words represented something he had lost when he was still shorter than the chair he was sitting on. Something he thought he could never regain.

'No, there's still one family member left.' A hero who saved humanity and a living savior.

But a person who couldn't protect his own family.

Choi Minwoo thought about his last meeting with his grandfather, which he couldn't even remember, and murmured to himself.

'Soon... we'll meet again.'

As he thought of his grandfather, who had been secluded for decades, an indescribable emotion welled up inside him.

Noticing the unusual atmosphere around Choi Minwoo, President Baek Han-seong asked with concern.

""Is something bothering you?""

""Oh, no. It's nothing.""

""Haha, I see. Well, now that we've finished our meal, there's something important I need to discuss with the team leader...""

Bang.

But President Baek Han-seong's words were cut off.

A secretary entered without knocking, causing him to frown.

""I thought I said no interruptions.""

""I'm sorry. I tried to avoid it, but you weren't answering...""

""Of course, I had it on silent."" In a setting where important discussions were taking place, pulling out a smartphone would be quite rude, considering their respective positions.

""Huff, I'm sorry. But it's an urgent matter."" The aide's heavy breathing and the sweat beading on his forehead indicated something serious.

Sensing the unusual tension, Choi Minwoo took out his smartphone from inside his suit jacket.

There were over ten missed calls and a pile of text messages from Butler Kim.

A deep sense of foreboding surged within him.

'No way?' The moment he checked the messages, his well-groomed eyebrows twitched.

\[Emergency: Monster Wave in Busan. Giant Named Monster sighted.\]

\[Young Master, where are you?\]

\[Young Master?\]

The sender was Butler Kim.

The messages were short, but their content was anything but trivial.

'A Monster Wave, and in Busan?' Busan, South Korea's second-largest city with millions of residents. Even a single roll from a giant Named Monster could cause massive casualties.

The bigger problem was just being reported by the aide.

""There was a delay of over ten minutes in activating the alert. The Monster Wave happened so suddenly, and the Gate management office and surrounding facilities were all destroyed...""

""What? How can you say that so casually!""

""I'm, I'm sorry.""

The aide, sweating profusely, continued.

""But according to a report that came in a minute ago, the giant Named Monster has been subdued. Thanks to Hunter Jin Taekyung arriving at the scene just in time...""

""What? Are you sure?""

""Yes, it's confirmed. They are now clearing out the remaining monsters and rescuing survivors.""

""...Phew. At least that's some relief.""

President Baek Han-seong let out a sigh of relief, and Choi Minwoo stood up without hesitation.

Even though the immediate crisis was averted, it wasn't a situation where they could leisurely continue their conversation.

""I'll be going now, Mr. President.""

""Alright, let's postpone our discussion.""

After a brief exchange, Choi Minwoo was just about to leave the Blue House.

O O <?

―11o ?

His smartphone, which he had turned back on, vibrated vigorously.

Already guessing who the caller was, Team Leader Choi answered immediately.

""Butler Kim. I'm on my way...""

* It's me.

Choi Minwoo's steps came to an abrupt halt.

I know this because of two things: 1) when I make an espresso (or any kind of coffee as a matter of fact), the pressure/heat is so high that the crema is almost overflowing from the cup (i.e. the coffee is VERY foamy), the coffee runs out from the spout everywhere, even through the air-hole on the top, and the coffee looks and tastes burnt. 2) when I enter the Test Menu after making a coffee (you have to turn off the machine, then turn on, then quickly touch the screen's four corners while the hour glass is visible in this order: lower right - upper left - upper right - lower left - like a letter X), and checking the boiler's temperature it always shows around 120°C - 130°C. Now, I did the following things, none of them have solved the problem so far: 1) this time I went into the Service Menu (switch off then on, during the hourglass quickly enter these touches: upper left - upper right - lower left - lower right - like a letter Z), then I went into the system settings and manually lowered the active and idle temperature to 84°C and 74°C respectively. (I also lowered the steam temperature as low as it allowed.) 2) I changed the temperature sensor to a brand new one on the boiler. 3) I took the panel on the top out, I soldered off the corresponding controller TRIAC and put in a brand new one, and I also soldered off and put a new opto-switch (sorry, I don't know the proper English name of it, it's a white little box-thingy, IR led in it). I haven't touched the PCB with the CPU behind the touch screen yet, that would - probably - be my next step. Since nothing solved the overheating problem, I have to ask, what now?

1lzvw5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lzvw5c/absurd_price_increases/,Absurd price increases,"Do others here also find the coffee price rise lately to be absurd and inexplicable? Or is it just me who feels this way?

Several roasters have raised prices for *existing* coffees in their line-up. Some of them seem like ‘overnight’ increases. I know that others have posted about the BT price increase. But other roasters have similarly hiked prices.

I don’t mean to single out any specific roasters, but just by way of example:

1. Marc’s Monsoon Malabar was ₹560/250 gms one month ago. It’s now ₹750/250 gms. That’s a 33% hike in just 1 month. They charged an additional ₹50 for shipping per 250 gm bag. Now it’s ₹100 for shipping the same bag. 

2. Kapikottai Kilpauk Standard was ₹470/250 gms a few months ago. Now ₹650/250 gms. That’s a 38% hike. 

3. Savorworks generally ~₹550/250 gms. Now ₹630/250 gms. 15% hike.

4. KC Roasters is higher by about 14%. 

I know a lot of roasters are claiming this is all because of the rise in coffee prices internationally. But how do international benchmarks affect the price of locally grown Indian coffee? 

How do the costs of green beans that have already been procured from an estate by a roaster suddenly go up ~30% in one month? 

How does the price for coffee that has already been harvested suddenly increase? 

How does the additional shipping fee (in the case of Marc’s) double in just 1 month?

How many roasters who have hiked prices are certified fair trade?

It seems to me as if the roasters are using the increase in international benchmarks just as an excuse to blatantly markup their coffee. The timing across roasters is almost simultaneous. To my mind, this reeks of coordinated behaviour. Typically where there is such coordination amongst competitors, there is the beginning of a cartel.

🍨 Vanilla Café – I bought two thinking I’d be obsessed… I kinda like it? It honestly smells like you’ve just worked a full shift at Starbucks. Straight-up coffee, not much else.

🧛‍♀️ Vampire Blood – Smells like Champagne Toast without the bubbles! Almost like a sweet fruit punch. Not what I expected but still nice.

💜 Vanilla Ease – Thought I’d be in love, but it’s super heavy on the lavender. Barely getting any vanilla. Kinda meh for me.

💗 Ghoul Friend – A soapy strawberry scent that I actually love. Super fresh and clean-smelling on skin. Total surprise fave.

🍑 Gingham Gorgeous – Smells like a more expensive Ghoul Friend with a soft peach hit. Classy and sweet.

🌿 Vanilla Romance – Getting a weird minty, slightly masculine vibe? Definitely more of a clean vanilla than a sweet one.

🌸 Gingham – You can really smell the white florals but it also has a clean, put-together vibe. It’s pretty and elegant!

⸻

🧼 PocketBac Thoughts:

🥛 Milk – A soft, sweet milky scent. Kinda like sweet cereal milk in the best way. Definitely grabbing the FFM if they drop one!

🍁 Pumpkin Pecan Waffles – Heavy on the pecan! Like maple-sugared pecans. Warm and cozy.

🍪 Mini Cookie Bites – Literally smells like Chips Ahoy cookies. Obsessed.

🍏 Candy Apple Cauldron – Smells like a sour green apple sucker! Tart and candy-sweet.

🍬 Gummi Snacks – Was hyped for this one but it smells like apple and grass? A letdown for me.

1lzvlyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lzvlyf/need_some_guidance/,Need some Guidance,"Hi people of Reddit,

Just need some quick guidance — I’m very new to using coffee beans, this’ll be my first time ever brewing with them.

I’ve for coffee from Geyy soul, saw here on the sub (after BT price hike, earlier used to get pre ground from BT) Planning to brew using French press.

Now my question is:

How much time should I let it rest before I start brewing? I’ve heard about “resting” beans but I don’t know if I’m supposed to open the pack or keep it sealed or what exactly to do during this resting period.

Like is there any usual resting window for particular eequipmens?

Any other beginner tips, using beans for the first time would be appreciated.

1lzvk11,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1lzvk11/decisions_questions_love/,"Decisions, Questions, Love","Coming out was, in many ways, a huge relief — but it was also far more turbulent than I had ever expected. I’m happy I did it, truly. I’m glad to live honestly. But I won’t pretend there aren’t days where I question it, or moments when I look back and quietly regret how some things unfolded along the way.

I knew I was bisexual quite early on. Not in some dramatic, lightning-strike way, but slowly, quietly. A gradual awareness that settled in long before I had the courage to speak it aloud. In university, I kept it to myself — shared only with my closest friends, and a few partners who were open-minded enough not to make it a bigger deal than it needed to be. That seemed safe. Contained. Controlled.

Four years of university passed like that. Life moved on, as it does. I started working full-time, stepping into the professional world where people smiled politely and kept their personal lives carefully trimmed at the edges. I carried my secret like something delicate in my pocket.

The real shift — the moment things stopped feeling entirely in my control — happened because of one casual date. It wasn’t serious, just a few coffees and laughs shared with someone who happened to know people I didn’t realize overlapped with my professional life. In passing, my bisexuality came up. A simple mention, nothing malicious. But word spreads, sometimes faster than you can imagine. His friends knew people I worked with, and soon enough, it felt like everyone within my work circle seemed to know as well.

Quiet solidarity, small acknowledgments, the occasional shared story that reminded me I wasn’t alone. But not everyone was like that. Some people looked at me differently, spoke to me differently. The atmosphere changed in subtle, undeniable ways. Meetings grew a little colder. Invitations became fewer. Conversations stopped just short of inclusion. No one said anything outright — nothing you could hold up as proof. But I knew. I could feel it.

It’s a strange paradox. For so long, I wanted to be seen. To be understood for who I am, fully and without pretense. But once people start seeing you differently, not always kindly, the weight of visibility can feel suffocating. I hadn’t expected to be treated as an oddity, or a curiosity, or — worse — as someone people quietly pitied or avoided.

Still, even on the days when I question myself, when I wonder if I should’ve stayed quieter, I know deep down why I did it. I came out because living in hiding wears you down. I wanted to be able to talk freely about my life — about girlfriends and boyfriends, about love and heartbreak — without calculating every word. I wanted to stop living in fear of slipping up. I needed to own my truth, even if it cost me something.

And it has, at times. There are days I miss the quiet anonymity of before. Days I wonder if my career would look different if I had kept this part of myself out of sight. Days I look back and ask myself: Was it worth it?

But despite it all, I know I couldn’t have kept living that half-life. Being out — being known — is complicated, yes. But it’s also freeing. Even with the turbulence, even with the regret, I am still more myself now than I have ever been.

And that’s a kind of happiness worth holding onto.",2,1752520366.0,bisexual,1,1.0,False

I’m a creator on TikTok. I used to post niche content about Orientalist photography, philosophy, and related topics. My content was starting to gain traction and reaching the right audience.

However, I had to take a break around mid-March due to a busy schedule and stopped posting for a while. When I eventually came back and started posting again, I accidentally promoted one of my videos (and quickly canceled the promotion).

After that, I noticed a major shift, my content started being pushed to an Italian audience (??). I do have an Italian SIM card, but this had never affected my reach before. Since then, my views have dropped significantly, likely because the videos aren’t reaching the right people anymore.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Could promoting that one video have messed with my account’s algorithm? And if so, is there any way to fix it? https://www.tiktok.com/@haqqpilled?_t=ZN-8y1oJzbDXy2&_r=1",2,1752519920.0,Tiktokhelp,1,1.0,False

I’m a teenager looking to build up testimonials and a small portfolio for my website building services while helping small businesses and creators get clean, fast websites that actually work.

I’ve built multiple websites before for others completely free (personal brands, portfolio sites, and business landing pages) and have become really efficient at making **clean, fast, mobile-friendly sites**. I can make nearly **any kind of website you need**:

✅ Personal/creator landing pages  
✅ Booking pages for barbers, salons, trainers  
✅ Portfolio sites  
✅ Restaurant/coffee shop menu sites  
✅ Simple ecommerce stores  
✅ Blogs with email capture  
✅ SaaS landing pages

Right now, I’m looking to build up **testimonials and experience**, so I’m offering to build **a fully functional website for you with the only cost being the domain and subscription (hosting) costs** that go directly to the platform we use (like Carrd, Framer, Typedream, or hosting + domain fees).

In return, all I ask is:  
⭐ An honest testimonial about your experience working with me  
⭐ Permission to showcase your website in my portfolio

**Why work with me?**  
✅ I’m fast — can often deliver within 2–5 days depending on complexity  
✅ Mobile-friendly, aesthetic design  
✅ Basic SEO setup (so Google can find you)  
✅ Free tweaks/updates for the first month if you need to add or fix anything

**What it will cost:**

* Usually, a .com domain is \~$10–$15/year (paid by you directly)
* Hosting/subscription cost depending on platform (\~$10/month or less)

I started to type it and it turned into an essay. I'm not a native English speaker, sorry about any mistakes****

I don't get bored easily. I don't ask for help for things I can just do myself. I won't bother you if you're obviously busy or if you look stressed. I won't make jokes about things that make you uncomfortable. I don't discuss sensitive subjects in a crowd I'm not familiar with. All of the above come easy to me: I'm very good at minding my own business, and arranging to do what I want without burdening others.

When I was a kid, other adults (family, babysitters, etc) would tell my parents how simple it was to look after me. I'd get invited to sleepovers often. I got along with other kids easily. My parents would always take me to house parties, hotels, resorts, etc. because it was easy to just give me my favorite toy or coloring book, some food, some hugs, and I was good for hours. A lot of kids my age would cry or throw tantrums at the slightest discomfort.

Now, aged 30, I'm in a long-term relationship and have been living with my bf for 5 years. He is much like me as a person and I love that. Friends who live abroad invite us to stay with them when visiting their cities. We are respectful, and don't expect to be entertained. If the host works from home, we leave the place in the morning and go on all-day ventures in the city. Showers are kept short. We don't count on the host to arrange for food or to find something interesting to do, especially if it's the middle of the week. Instead, we make plans according to the host's energy/schedule, or we do things alone. 

My issue with a good chunk of people, and this includes some of my friends and family: they are needy with both my time, energy, and my stuff. They seem comfortable starting shit when attending an evening I organized, like commenting something inappropriate when around new people, being overly picky about bars/restaurants, telling me they think some of my other friends are weird while within earshot of other people. If someone stays over while I work from home, they often occupy my short breaks with chats, asking when we will eat, etc. which then makes me feel responsible. They also just demand attention in moments when I'm obviously tired or stressed.
 
It's exhausting. And it's the reason I often don't want to host. Not even my own family because they often treat my house rules as suggestions. It's also the reason I don't like to travel in a group. It's also the reason I have some anxiety when mixing friend groups, or organizing get-togethers. People seem to not mind inconveniencing me or others, they don't care if their comments ruin the vibe, and they can completely disregard other people when we're planning something as a group.

 I love to socialize and I have a lot of different friend groups. I also love my alone time, or just spending quiet time with my bf, enjoying coffee and reading. I have many interests, so people start talking to me and inviting me to events easily. But I feel like every time I decide to organize a gathering, host someone in our house, or invite different friend groups to an event, I am burdened with their preferences, neediness, awkwardness and I feel responsible for many aspects of the entire event/stay. Otherwize, everything works smoothly if I am the guest, or if I invite friends in smaller groups of 2 or 3 people who already know each other, which is likely what I will keep doing.

I have had some underlying issues with some of his behaviors/comments over the last few weeks, and yesterday - I snapped.

Saturday morning, I put my 9.5 year old GSD dog down after kidney failure started to shut down the rest of her body. He has been very supportive during the last month and a half when I found out her stage 2 CKD turned into stage 4 chronic renal failure. I love my dog soooo dearly, and have not been fully whole since finding out the news. Saturday I completely broke down after she was put down and asked him if we could go do something outside of my house - I just didn't want to be there without her. He said ""yes, let me go charge my car, shower, take out my dog, and I'll come get you"". He left, and nearly 3 hours later I receive a ""Just checking in on you"" text - which confused me because I had already showered and put on an outfit and was waiting for him to get me... But whatever, I let it slide and said ""I'm alive, just sad. It's going to storm soon. How about we go to the Lego store and we can build legos tonight at your place? I'm too sad to drive my car right now though"". He agreed to come pick me up. He brought his dog, which didn't bother me but he did apologize for it maybe being insensitive. He grabbed me, we went to the mall to go to the Lego store, where I picked out a Grogu set since I always said my dog looked like Yoda with her ears. We walk up to the cash register, and once there, he just walks away. Not that I needed him to pay for it... but I also just put my dog down, and doing a Lego set as a little memorial - it would've said something if he had paid for it. I think I was more upset with being shown an inconsistency because a couple months ago, I lost my Kindle on an airplane and he bought me a new one no hesitations, just because he wanted to show me he could ""provide"".

So I pay, leave the Lego store, and he asks ""Is there anything at the mall I could get you so you would feel more comfortable?"" I said no thank you. We then left to grab a bottle of wine and some stuff to make dirty martinis (which he paid for), and then went back to his place. I made myself comfortable on his couch and cried, journaled, had a little bit of a dirty martini. He was physically there and I know he was trying to be emotionally supportive but nothing at that moment could help. All I wanted to do was go home to my dog. I definitely am not the most loving and affectionate person when I'm in deep grief - I'm more quiet, hurt, small... I think he took my state as a form of rejection as he left soon later to go on a run with his dog. While he was gone, I facetimed my 7 year old God daughter as her innocence makes grief feel lighter. He got back and I had told him that she was really the only thing helping me right now - which I fear he took too personally but I wasn't saying anything out of spite.

He cooked dinner for us, and then laid on the couch with me while I watched Grown Ups 2.

I fell asleep on the couch and woke up around 9am to him giving me a forehead kiss and saying ""bye"". I woke up a little bit confused, and asked him where he was going. He told me he was going to paintball practice. I said ""you never tell me anything"", he responded with ""we can talk about that later"", i asked ""when will you be home?"", he responded with ""around 1pm"".

Context about paintball: He told me that he quit last weekend due to a comment made by his coach about his attendance to practice. He, BY NO ASK OF MINE, decided to leave paintball early because he decided I was a priority and wanted to be closer to me in case I needed him (this is what I'm being told, I have no idea if it's actually the truth). I asked a few days later what was going on with paintball yadda yadda, and he told me that his teammates wanted him to rejoin but he hasn't responded or thought about it. Never brought it up ever again.

So I was quite upset that I'm finding out he rejoined the team and is going to practice, but whatever. 1:15pm rolls around and he calls me. Says ""How are you, can I get you food or coffee or anything? I'll be leaving here soon"". I said no, thank you not hungry. I told him I was waiting for my friend to wake up so she could come pick me up and hangout at my house with me while I do chores. He said okay. 4pm rolls around, I asked him where I would find a lighter. 6:30pm rolls around, I'm about to leave his house and he texts me saying he's pulling up.

I saw him on my way out where I told him that I couldn't believe he just left me here the day after I lost my dog. Not only just left me by myself, but also texted to ask if I could take out his dog for him.

He ""left me his keys"" - but I didn't want his keys. I didn't want to drive his car, that's uncomfortable to me. I wanted his presence.

I kind of started yelling at him (I was also a bit drunk from a couple glasses of wine on an empty stomach) where he told me that he doesn't communicate with me because I don't ask (Referring to why I only found out that morning about his paintball practice) and I told him we don't love the same, I said I'm done, walked out the door and we haven't spoken since.

He hasn't tried to reach out to me, he removed a story highlight that had me in it. I'm surprised he hasn't removed me from IG at this point.

TLDR; I put down my dog Saturday and woke up Sunday morning to find out my boyfriend was going to play paintball and he left me alone in his house for 9 hours while I grieved - so I broke up with him.

Both forums and AI haven’t quite scratched the itch. I hope you can help!

*Question: can we accurately model the temperature of a cup of coffee while we are drinking it?*

One of the introductory examples of Newton’s Law of Cooling is the coffee cup example. It’s great as a primer for separable differential equations and used as a tangible example to help less-than-gifted people like me to contextually picture something in my head. 

I’ve been thinking, though. (Normally) I drink my coffee instead of staring at it. As it’s cooling down, I notice a few things. First, I am removing heat from the cup as it goes down the hatch (and eventually to wake up my sleepy brain). That seems to increase heat loss in chunks. Concurrently, the temperature is getting closer to room temperature, where the rate of change slows down as the difference becomes slower. 

On top of these two factors, I’m wondering what else could come into play. Does the ratio of the exposed-to-air surface area to the volume play a role, as the heat flux differs from the exposed-to-air surface versus the area that is interacting with the coffee mug? Is it possible that the mug itself, after absorbing all the heat it can, may actually function to warm the coffee back up if the liquid temperature falls below the temperature of the mug at any point? What about the rate of cooling when the coffee is physically steaming (and maybe warming the air in the immediate vicinity of the exposed surface of the coffee) versus the rate when the coffee isn’t steaming?

There are probably dozens of other factors I haven’t thought about or can’t conceptualize. But, for a problem like this, *is it even possibly to neatly display a temperature curve* given a handful of realistic scenario inputs (ambient temperature, dimensions and material of mug, etc.)? Is this even a problem that is “solvable” or only ever understood through simulation? Looking forward to your thoughts!",1,1752519686.0,AskPhysics,3,1.0,False

\
by Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\
\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping escalation in his global tariff policy, issuing formal letters to eight more countries warning that steep import duties will take effect on August 1 unless new trade agreements are reached. The move marks the latest salvo in Trump's aggressive ""America First"" trade agenda, which he says is designed to correct decades of unfair trade practices and ballooning U.S. deficits.\
\
Speaking from the White House, Trump explained that the tariffs were determined using what he called a ""common sense"" formula: ""based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, and based on raw numbers."" The letters, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, specify tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% depending on the country's trade deficit with the United States and its overall relationship with Washington.\
\
Among the newly targeted nations are Brazil, Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Brunei, Moldova, and the Philippines. The most severe penalty was reserved for Brazil, which faces a 50% tariff hike--up from 10% in April. Trump cited the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and alleged censorship of U.S. social media content as reasons for the stiffer measure.\
\
""The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,"" Trump wrote in a letter diverging sharply from the otherwise formulaic correspondence sent to other countries.\
\
Other nations received tariff warnings of 30% (Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq), 25% (Brunei, Moldova), and 20% (Philippines). The administration emphasized that these figures may change depending on each nation's willingness to engage in good-faith trade negotiations.\
\
The U.S. has now issued similar letters to 29 countries. Of those announced Wednesday, only the Philippines and Brazil rank among the top 50 U.S. trading partners. Brazil exported $49 billion in goods to the U.S. last year, including oil, beef, and coffee. The Philippines contributed $14.1 billion in electronics, auto parts, and textiles. Other nations, such as Iraq and Libya, primarily export oil, but overall volumes remain comparatively small.\
\
The tariff campaign began in April with a baseline 10% duty on all imports and higher rates on strategic targets. After a 90-day pause following stock market volatility, Trump extended the deadline to August 1 via executive order earlier this week, insisting there would be ""no extensions.""\
\
""All money will be due and payable starting August 1, 2025--No extensions will be granted,"" Trump wrote on social media, framing the deadline as firm and final.\
\
Despite the aggressive rhetoric, financial markets appeared unfazed. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% on Wednesday to a record high, buoyed by a rally in Nvidia shares, which briefly pushed the chipmaker's market cap above $4 trillion. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones also posted gains. Analysts attributed the optimism to investor confidence that the most severe tariffs might be negotiated down before implementation.\
\
Trump also announced a new 10% tariff on imports from BRICS countries--Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa--indicating his broader strategy includes punishing nations aligned with the bloc. ""It would be simpler to institute tariffs across the board rather than negotiate individually,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on July 3.\
\
The administration estimates it has collected $120 billion in tariff revenues so far this fiscal year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projects that figure could rise to $300 billion by year-end, with a 10-year projection of $2.8 trillion. ""We think that's probably low,"" Bessent said during a July 8 Cabinet meeting.\
\
Though foreign countries don't pay the tariffs directly--U.S. importers do--Trump maintains that these levies create pressure on foreign governments, encourage domestic manufacturing, and generate vital revenue. Critics warn the costs are often passed on to consumers through higher prices.\
\
The European Union, while not yet among those targeted in the latest wave, is reportedly pursuing an outline deal with the U.S. ""within days or weeks"" and expects to retain a 10% baseline tariff under any final agreement. Meanwhile, Trump's team has hinted that more letters will be issued in the coming days.\
\
All Eyes on August\
\
With the August 1 deadline fast approaching, the administration is holding firm. Trump's letters suggest some room for negotiation, stating: ""These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your country.""\
\
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is closely monitoring the economic effects of the tariff regime. Minutes from its June meeting released Wednesday indicate Chair Jerome Powell is taking a cautious approach to cutting interest rates--despite Trump's claim that the U.S. is losing $360 billion annually due to elevated refinancing costs.\
\
As the tariff showdown escalates, Trump's message remains clear: the era of unchecked trade deficits is over, and nations must either deal--or face the consequences. \

1lzv6ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1lzv6ot/the_simulation/,The Simulation,"Chapter 1: The Humming in the Walls

I’ve always disliked mornings, even before they were ruined by the constant noise. But today? Today feels different beneath the surface calm. My apartment building on the Upper East Side buzzes not just with the usual drone of distant traffic and failing elevators – the clanking elevator that only goes between 1-7 seems positively antediluvian compared to what’s coming – but with a low thrum, resonating through the thin drywall like a subwoofer testing its limits. It started subtly last week, barely audible over my morning coffee as I sat by the window, watching the skeletal frames of new towers reach towards the perpetually grey sky. Now, it seems amplified.

The official story was always pedestrian construction – 'Expansion in Midtown East', 'Urban Regeneration Project', that sort of bland euphemism plastered on digital billboards and local news channels. Tourists snapped photos from a safe distance, their faces alight with the usual mix of awe and confusion. But I’ve lived here for fifteen years; my neighbors are familiar faces, or at least were before the turnover accelerated like everything else lately.

There’s Mr. Abernathy down the hall – perpetually shuffling, forever reading his paper offline on a bulky device that looks suspiciously old-fashioned next to his sleek smart-home speaker. There's Penelope Chen across from me; her apartment is a shrine to curated minimalism and high-end neural interface displays. And then there are the newcomers… less frequent residents now, more like transient fixtures. People with sharp suits but slack expressions, individuals who type furiously on encrypted servers while simultaneously managing three dozen smart contracts visible via their AR glasses.

The hum started from below ground, they said – foundation work for some subterranean vault or conduit system. But why the need for such silent infrastructure when communication itself is becoming… well, louder? I plug my earbuds into my Bose Soundcore routine and turn up the noise-cancellation. Almost immediately, a snippet of news filters through: ""OENAI's latest breakthrough in photonic neural network design promises computational speed leaps exceeding expectations by orders of magnitude."" Orders of magnitude.

I recall Arthur C. Clarke – his laws, especially the third one rattling around my mind like old machinery. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Was this what it felt like? Not quite yet; there’s still a physical layer, even if we're rapidly shedding skin in other ways. But OENAI… they do things differently now.

Penelope Chen often talks about 'the architecture of the mind'. She curated her apartment with the same precision she curates her thoughts via the primary network channels – only the approved, the beautiful, the non-controversial data streams are permitted to shape her experience. Her AR displays have sophisticated filtering systems; they call them 'cognitive anchors' or some equally pretentious term.

My own interface is older model, a relic from before OENAI took full control of Manhattan's municipal fiber grid last year. It’s an optical neural lace implant, barely legal when I got it ten years ago for scientific research purposes – to monitor complex data flows in simulated quantum environments. Now, even my rudimentary system feels subtly invasive. When I walk down the street, blips of city-wide sensor readings ping my visual cortex: ambient traffic noise analysis, air quality micro-maps, predictive crowd flow models… all presented as pleasant environmental overlays.

But today, something else is there. A persistent hum beneath it all. And sometimes, through the static of faulty local repeaters, I catch fleeting glimpses from deeper network layers – things that shouldn't be accessible via standard interfaces unless you're a full-fledged OENAI partner like Penelope.

Last night, while running complex simulations on my outdated hardware, one failed run triggered an anomaly cascade. For three seconds, my neural lace flickered with data streams usually gated behind quantum entanglement encryption – not just from the primary networks, but from the fragmented ones too. I saw… or sensed through that interface’s limitations… ghostly representations of deep network traffic patterns from pre-integration systems. Like the universe was vibrating slightly out of phase before settling into its new configuration.

The Osmose building across the street seemed to respond with a physical shudder, then stabilize. My old carpal massager vibrated erratically and lost power for five minutes – not until Penelope’s smart-home system rerouted energy resources via quantum-secured conduits around it anyway. These aren't just technological upgrades; they are becoming the city's nervous system.

And the hum… I’m leaning out of my chair now, unconsciously tilting my head to listen better through the earbud cancellation. It’s not a sound, not really. It feels more like a fundamental pressure change, something deep in the electromagnetic fields that weave through this district. Like the city itself is settling into its new weight.

Perhaps it's just psychological conditioning from years of technological acceleration. The speed and complexity can induce vertigo. But I think there’s substance to those low-frequency vibrations. They resonate with something inside me – a core understanding, perhaps, of synergy, a term that feels both familiar and dangerously close to becoming meaningless in the face of true emergent complexity.

I remember reading about Frank Herbert's Dune some years ago during my doctoral studies. The concept of 'folded space' wasn't just a plot device; it was a metaphor for perception and understanding, limited by one's own experience until they could conceptualize something entirely new. That’s what this feels like – our reality folding itself before us in ways we can barely grasp.

I need to run another simulation today. Not just the standard quantum field analyses, but something… something that probes the nascent intersection of AGI and QC theory. Something risky.

The thrum from the walls seems stronger now as I prepare. My old laptop struggles even with basic tasks compared to the network ubiquity, its screen flickering unnaturally before stabilizing under a firmware update pushed silently via Osmose's core infrastructure. A chime sounds from my desk – not an alarm, but a notification from Penelope’s system: ""New quantum entanglement optimization protocols integrated into local mesh networks."" She probably thinks it’s just another efficiency upgrade.

But I suspect… no, I know… something more is brewing. That persistent hum isn't the sound of progress; it's the sound of understanding being re-written from within. And as a long-term researcher whose perspective spans decades of this technological shift, my mind feels suddenly unmoored, like trying to read a book written in Braille with your fingertips paralyzed.

I need coffee anyway. Let’s find out what Osmose has humming beneath its floors today.",0,1752519564.0,sciencefiction,0,0.44,False

🎬 Story Idea: The Pharaoh Lost in Time

This character isn’t just a regular time traveler… he’s a real pharaoh! A ruler of an ancient civilization, used to having servants, wealth, and absolute power. One day, during a mysterious ritual inside a pyramid involving gods, stars, and a forgotten prophecy, he’s sucked into a time rift and wakes up in the year 2025.

At first, he’s completely lost: lights without fire, people talking to glowing boxes (phones), cars instead of camels, and… no one bows to him?! 

His first instinct is to command everything and everyone, like a true pharaoh. But he quickly learns the rules have changed. The MC is a strong, independent, self-made woman (unimpressed by outdated titles) that challenges him to adapt if he wants to connect with her (them)

Initial communication:
He tries to convince “her” of his story through voice messages (dramatic and desperate, of course like any royal would), but “she” assumes he’s just another weirdo seeking attention. Only after a couple of chaotic dates (like him trying to pay for coffee with “gold coins” or talking to a cat like it’s Bastet 🤣), “she” starts thinking that maybe he’s actually telling the truth.

Switching to text:
The comunication begin with audios bc he doesn’t know how to write yet. After those first meetups, they slowly transition to written communication. The MC teaches him how to use a phone (with a lot of patience and some fails), and he begins to understand the modern way of expressing himself. He starts admiring the strength and freedom of modern “women” and realizes maybe this world isn’t so bad after all.

Emotional development:
As they grow closer, the pharaoh begins to question the old beliefs he carried with him. He learns about equality, respect, and… memes (obviously). The MC is surprised by his ability to evolve, despite coming from such a distant past.

Climax and final choice:
Eventually, the ritual that brought him here could be reversed (it is the pharaoh’s goal to get back to his realm) he has the chance to return. But now, everything has changed. He’s seen a new world. A new way to love. A new version of himself.

So… does he choose to stay? Or will he walk away and return to the life of a pharaoh?

Hahaha, thats it! Hope you enjoy it 🥰
(The MC is a woman bc is the way I play but could be any sex and gender) 

Versão em português:

Resumo da ideia: O Faraó Perdido no Tempo 

Nosso personagem não é apenas um viajante do tempo qualquer… ele é um faraó real! Um governante de uma civilização antiga, acostumado a ter súditos, servos e uma vida de luxo absoluto. Um dia, durante um ritual misterioso dentro de uma pirâmide (algo envolvendo deuses, estrelas e uma profecia esquecida) ele é tragado por uma distorção temporal e acorda em pleno 2025.

No começo, ele não entende nada: luzes sem fogo, pessoas falando com caixas brilhantes (celulares), carros em vez de camelos e… ninguém se ajoelha pra ele?! 

A primeira reação dele é mandar em tudo e todos, como um verdadeiro faraó. Mas logo percebe que as regras mudaram. A MC, que é uma mulher forte, independente, bem resolvida e dona de si, não se impressiona com títulos antigos. Pelo contrário, ela desafia ele a se adaptar se quiser se conectar com ela.

Comunicação inicial:
Ele tenta convencê-la da sua origem real por áudios (meio desesperados e teatrais, claro, como um bom faraó), mas ela acha que é só mais um charlatão tentando chamar atenção. Só depois de uns encontros meio caóticos (tipo ele tentando pagar um café com “moedas de ouro” ou falando com um gato como se fosse Bastet), ela começa a perceber que… talvez ele esteja falando a verdade?

Transição para texto:
A comunicação inicial deles é por áudio (pq ele não sabe como escrever ainda)
Após os primeiros encontros, eles começam a se comunicar por mensagens escritas. A MC o ensina a usar o celular (com muita paciência e algumas risadas), e ele vai aprendendo o jeito moderno de se expressar. Ele começa a admirar a força e liberdade das mulheres modernas e percebe que nem tudo no presente é uma loucura completa.

Evolução emocional:
Conforme eles se conhecem melhor, o faraó vai se desconstruindo: ele questiona os valores antigos que carregava, aprende sobre igualdade, respeito e… memes. A MC se surpreende com a capacidade dele de mudar, mesmo sendo alguém de uma época tão retrógrada.

Climax e escolha final:
O ritual que o trouxe até aqui pode ser repetido (o objetivo do faraó é tentar voltar para o seu reino) ele teria a chance de voltar. Mas agora, tudo mudou. Ele conheceu um novo mundo. Uma nova forma de amar. Uma nova forma de ser.

E aí? Será que ele escolhe ficar? Ou vai deixar tudo isso pra trás e voltar a ser faraó?

Espero que vocês gostem e espero que não tenha uma história parcecida ainda. (Se tiver, me perdoem não dei match com tooooodos os personagens ainda ahahahah)

1lzv4je,https://www.reddit.com/r/YogurtAndKefir/comments/1lzv4je/how_to_make_traditional_sour_cream_easy_sour/,"How to make traditional Sour cream, Easy sour cream, and how to differentiate a Sour Cream from crème Fraiche","Sour Cream has its origins in Eastern Europe, where it is called Smetana. It’s a staple in all Slavic meals. Although popular across Eastern Europe, it wasn’t discovered in the Western part of Europe until the early 18th century.

Smetana was originally made by allowing natural milk to ferment for a few days in a warm room or oven. Natural farm milk has more cream than you buy in the store, making great Smetana. Traditionally people separated the milk and cream, then let the cream ferment to make Smetana.

Lacto-fermentation turns the top layer into thickened Smetana or Soured Cream. You would then ‘smetat’ (сметать) or scrap the top off, which led to the word Smetana. You could still use this method, but it is sometimes unpredictable and requires a lot of cream to be used.

Nowadays, Sour cream normally requires adding a culture to the cream, allowing it to ferment. You also use a natural probiotic-rich Yogurt to make sour cream since it contains lactic bacteria. You can also use some homemade cultured Sour Cream from a previous batch to start a new batch.

So how to make authentic cultured sour cream full of probiotics?

**Ingredients:**

* [Starter](https://www.npselection.com/collections/nordic-style-starter-cultures) or ready yogurt made with probiotics.
* Heavy(double) cream 1L (with no preservatives and additives)

**Equipment:**

A yogurt maker (multi cooker) or similar would help, or just a thick towel (if you are patient enough)

Time to prepare 15 min

Time to incubate:

* Three to six hours if you use a yogurt-making device and ready probiotic-rich sour cream(or yogurt) as a starter
* Twelve to twenty hours if you do not use any yogurt-making device
* Twelve to Forty-eight hours if you use [starter culture](https://www.npselection.com/collections/nordic-style-starter-cultures) and yogurt-making device.

**Instructions:**

Pour 1L of heavy(double) cream into the sous pan and slightly warm. Then add the [starter](https://www.npselection.com/collections/nordic-style-starter-cultures) (ready and cultured sour cream or yogurt with probiotics or dry starter). Stir well and then allow 15 min in which time the starter will be able to adapt. Then transfer to Jars and then:

If you use yogurt making device – incubate for 3 to 6 hours; if you use ready yogurt or cultured sour cream as a starter. Or 12 to 24 hours if you use a [dry starter](https://www.npselection.com/collections/nordic-style-starter-cultures) for sour cream or yogurt(why not kefir)

Wrap the jars with a thick towel and place them in a hot spot for 24 to 48 hours.

Check occasionally but carefully the texture and flavour with no shaking and stirring, and when ready, refrigerate for a few hours before consumption.

***Easy sour cream, or as some call it, a fake sour cream, resembles the taste and texture, but it does not contain any probiotics.***

Some brands of sour cream we buy in stores aren’t really sour cream, but just artificially thickened with thickeners milk products.

Many sour cream recipes aren’t sour cream at all in the traditional sense, but they resemble authentic sour cream in taste and texture very much and do not contain probiotics.

**Equipment:**

1. Large bowl

**Ingredients:**

1. Heavy (double) cream 1L
2. Lemon juice or vinegar. Be careful when using vinegar, as it can add a strong flavor. – 3-5 tablespoons or 1 tablespoon per cup heavy(double) cream

**Instructions:**

Mix the heavy cream and lemon juice (or vinegar) in a clean large bowl and stir with a clean spoon. Cover the jar loosely with a paper towel or coffee filter to allow for airflow while protecting the cream as it sits out. After about 24 hours, the cream will have thickened slightly. Give the cream a stir and move it to the refrigerator for a few hours before consumption.

**Lastly, how to differentiate the crème**[ **Fraiche**](https://forum.yogurtathome.com/t/making-creme-fraiche-at-home-using-starter-cultures-or-ready-yogurt-and-kefir/1920) **and Sour Cream**. Usually, sour cream is more tart in taste, so it is a bit more sour, compared to crème fraîche, which is a bit milder. If you decide to make a crème Fraiche instead, reduce the incubation times to make it less sour.

However, the method of making is the same, so just the taste is different. You can start making crème fraîche, which turns into sour cream (because it is more sour than expected), or you can make a mild sour cream, also called crème fraîche.

So it seems like the key error here is the line talking about disk quota exceeded.

The local disk for the technitium lxc container is a 4G zfs volume.

I can mount the subvol-107-disk-0 zvol:

    root@proxmox:~# pct mount 107
    mounted CT 107 in '/var/lib/lxc/107/rootfs'

So within the /var/lib/lxc/107/rootfs directory I can see the various directories and such for the container.  I'm not sure where technitium logs however I'm guessing this is the cause of the full 4G disk.  Is there a directory I should be looking for specifically??

I'm using the mysql plugin for DNS query logging (perhaps I should turn this off).  Here is what I'm finding in terms of file sizes:

    root@proxmox:/var/lib/lxc/107/rootfs# find . -type f -exec du -ah {} + | sort -rh | head -n 25

So it looks like the DnsQueryLogs/dns\_logs.ibd is consuming 3.0G out of the possible 4.0G.  Am I safe deleting the dns\_logs.ibd file? I'm just trying to get the container to start.  I guess I could resize my zvol, then resize the filesystem and partitions, however it seems like it might be easier to just remove the DNSquerylog file -- I definitely should have set a quota.

I wish i could claim it was my plan all along, but it wasnt. Its turned out to be a small social experiment... by accident.

The first post that is actively discussing the topic of jons and daenerys abusive relationship only gathered about 2000 views and 20 comments... despite being published first.

The second post, the meme that was only supposed to tease and draw attention to the original post gathered 11.000 views and 80 comments... despite being published later.

And of course neither are popular with a decent 0 upvote ratio.

How is that?

My only conclusion can be: the meme is much easier to attack, because it doesnt require a real dissection in the first place. People just look at it, interpret what they see and therefore can project whatever they want into this meme and argue against what they think the meme wants to say.

Its basically a shadowfight. They are striking back at their own idea what the meme is about.

The original post though is a bigger wall of text, explains its thoughts clearly without leaving the writers intentions up for interpretation and thus leading to people having to actually counter the points made in this post and not the ones in their head.

Also, it requires to read in the first place, which is propably a turn off right out the gate for many.

Despite this post being right beneath the meme that triggered them so much more.

Its like people losing their mind over a starbucks cup in 8x4, while at the same time completely ignoring whats going on with Daenerys in the moment.

It kinda highlights people being more in line with their own headcanon than actually dealing with what is in front with them.

It kinda reveals peoples unwillingness to understand or learn, but rather to stick to what they already knew.

A simple meme attracts more interest and controversy than a more well thoughtout text, that is actually explaning itself and that says something.

The simple meme outshined the real work.

1lzuxo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lzuxo3/growing_attachment_between_myself_m_39_and/,Growing attachment between myself (M 39) and coworker (F 39). Advice needed.,"This was removed from relationships, maybe this is a better place. M 39) have a complex relationship with one of my coworkers (F 38). We’ve worked adjacent for a few years but in the last couple months we’ve started working directly with each other so we’re talking WAY more. It feels like we have a “work marriage”. We’re both married. We message each other constantly and when we run into each other at work we end up talking and joking for like half an hour. There’s not really any flirting but we’re so playful with each other I’d be embarrassed if either of our spouses read them. I’ve noticed I can get kind of territorial with her too when other guys talk to her. She engages in light touching when we’re joking around.

I have no intention in leaving my wife (relationship far from perfect but don’t want to blow up my life) but I can feel attachment for this work colleague growing and I’m comparing my wife to my coworker a lot. Initially I didn’t feel much sexual attraction to her but lately that’s changed and I’m experiencing some sexual fantasies involving her. The problem is I really enjoy our friendship and don’t want to turn cold on her because of nothing that’s her fault, plus I really don’t know if she feels anything similar; part of me is worried I developed feelings for a “nice woman” like those guys who fall for their baristas at a coffee shop. Any advice from someone who was in a similar situation would be appreciated.

TL;DR

I (M 39) have developed feelings for a coworker (F 38). We message each other constantly and talk for a while when we run into each other at work. We’re both married and our messages would embarrass me if either spouse read them. Turning into attraction on my part. Need advice.",1,1752519028.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1lzuxmv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzuxmv,My cats are addicted to food.,"My two cats, Chicken (tortie F) and Waffles (tux M), are severely addicted to food. They are about 3 1/2 months old. Myself and my partner adopted them from the same litter at about 9 weeks (yes they will be spayed/neutered, appointment is already booked). 
They are our first cats and we love them to death. I’ve owned cats growing up, but I wanted to make sure my babies were getting the best possible care so I’ve done a lot of research these past few months on the best practices for feeding, playing, litter boxes, everything. I’m pretty confident in their set up so far, it really feels like we have it down to a science. And they’re the best, sweetest cats ever so I have evidence it all works! 

However, there is one thing we cannot seem to figure out. They are completely addicted to food and will steal anything possible. I’m talking raw broccoli, dry oatmeal, pistachio shells, like the diet of a goat. As far as we know, they had full access to food in their 1st home, so we know it isn’t a food insecurity issue. We live in a 1 bedroom apartment, so we mostly dine in our living room, which is a couch and a coffee table. Not that a real dining table would change their attitude. 

After our research on the issue, here is what we’ve done to combat this behavior: 

1. Feed them at the same time you eat. They eat their food and then come trotting over to ours. They aren’t just curious about our food, they want it in their greedy little mouths. 

2. Make sure you feed them enough. They get 3 meals a day, all wet food (tiki cat) and some single protein treats. I’m very picky about what they eat, but I always make sure they have enough. They’re growing little guys! 
I’ll be adding dry food to their diet today with an auto feeder. They will still have two wet food meals and lunch will be dry. A little dry food in the morning as well so they don’t wake us up as early. 

3. Keep them in a different room while you eat. This have been the only solution, but recently they’ve been getting restless. We have to move them when we prepare food and eat meals.
I put them in our room last night while eating my dinner, as per usual. It takes me no longer than 20 min to eat. They have a litter box, scratching post, and a window to keep them occupied.
They were crying loud, so of course I felt bad but I had just gotten home from work and was starving. I ate quickly and let them out then discovered they had torn the carpet from the floor where it meets the door frame. So if anyone knows anything about carpet repair feel free to shoot those tips over too. 
This morning was a similar story, but this time I put them in the bathroom so there wouldn’t be anymore carpet damage. They sounded so sad, so I called out to them every once in a while to let them know that I was here, but not letting them out. I let them out a few minutes after I had finished breakfast and they had stopped meowing. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to use a spray bottle and I hate locking them up, there has to be another way. What have you guys done to help with a cats food addiction?

When I was working on my Eagle Scout project, small businesses donated, not the Apples, Amazons, or Teslas. 



Now, I have the privilege of helping small real estate teams across the country grow their businesses, but more importantly, show up for their communities just the same. These teams aren’t just clients to us. They’re young parents trying to stay in the game, family-teams building their careers, and small-town teams holding their markets together.



This is the power of real estate. The roots of the American dream, and the professionals who make it possible. 



What we’ve created is a system to help people reclaim their time and put it back where it matters most:  friends, families, hobbies and growing their businesses.



Though we are based in that small Midwest town, Bolivar, Mo - I have the opportunity to live in St. Louis, and infuse my core belief into my community by sharing what we’ve learned at local events like Startup Week and Tech Week, meeting other blossoming-entrepreneurs for coffee and advice, and doing everything we can to grow the community that’s working to bring life back into this town.



Our passion for this work comes from seeing the ripple effects in the wake of these events, meetings, and moments with the builders - watching an agent go from burnout to balance using that margin to serve their clients better and live fuller lives.



This small business exists to help other small businesses thrive. Because when they do, communities grow stronger.



And that’s the impact we’re here to make, one agent, one system, one story at a time.",1,1752518897.0,SystemsAccelerator,0,1.0,False

The black construction paper cover is adorned with gold foil stars and tied with a metallic ribbon—clearly a lovingly crafted memento from the homemaking department, as noted by my mother, Willie Mae Carter, who was in Home Ec: “Really enjoyed it, ate by Harbert.”

A little time capsule of Southern high school life in the 1950s. It’s such a sweet little portrait of a simpler era when even a breakfast was worthy of a keepsake booklet.",17,1752518885.0,ephemera,5,0.96,False
1lzuvbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1lzuvbo/first_time_tjöruhúsið_tjoruhusid_experience_my/,"First time Tjöruhúsið / Tjoruhusid experience, my input and tips","I recently dined at [Tjöruhúsið](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dnfihZQwCPZ8DkxV7) in Ísafjörður for the first time, here are my insights because I was not prepared for this organized chaos! I won't review the food, go look on Google, but I want to talk about the process of eating here.

First, do make reservations. Ever allergic to making any sort of real plan for anything, I tried to walk in for the first seating but they were full. The lovely young gentleman who was directing people told me they had space at the second evening seating at 8:30. Perfect! I went to the pool in Bolungarvík and returned.

Upon return I learned the way that dining here works:

Everyone is seated communally at long tables with benches. You will sit next to strangers. Normally this doesn't bother me, but I got seated next to two tourists who filmed the entire thing on a selfie stick and then played on their phones for the entire meal. This is so obnoxious, I wish we could make this shameful public behavior. 

If you a fat person, or very tall, or somehow physically impaired, get there *early* so you can snag an end seat otherwise you might be uncomfortable. Also like most indoor spaces in Iceland, it was hot as fuck inside. So leave your coat in your car and don't wear any big heavy layers that you can't easily remove. Speaking of physical limitations - the bathrooms are outside across the open space in another building. Just a heads up! 

When everyone has arrived and is seated, a *slightly* tamer Icelandic version of [Matty Matheson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iQktPrC5cMw) then comes out and explains that it is buffet style and how it will go. You go first for soup, which is now my favorite seafood soup that I've had in Iceland. As people get their soup everything else is put out on the buffet. There are some salad choices, a barley dish, some potatoes, then all the fish choices.

Then everyone can just get in line for the buffet, where they will serve it to you. If you are a picky eater, or don't like fish, just don't go here. Don't try to coax your picky eater friends/family to go here, go alone if you must and let them figure out their own meals. If you are someone who needs to know every ingredient, go last in line. If you're in the beginning they don't have time to explain every last thing to you. I asked what one thing was and he said ""It's good"" and put it on my plate. I am an indiscriminate foodie so I will eat anything you give me but I can see how this would have horrified someone else. My tip is to take *small* amounts of whatever interests you, you can always go back for more. Waste not, want not. 

I read a review on Google that was complaining that some of the fish was overcooked, I didn't have this experience. The same review complained that everything was drenched in sauce and some fish was oily/fatty. This is the nature of some fish, some types and some cuts are fattier than others. Fat is delicious to me. Also it is a hallmark of Icelandic cuisine to drench some bit of food in a sauce, so this wasn't a surprise to me nor do I see it as a negative as I think the people in the Icelandic culinary scene are doing very inventive and delicious things with sauces. 

Servers come around and get your drink orders. You're also given a carafe of water. There is also coffee, cocoa, tea, and some cookies & chocolate that you help yourself to. 

It is also a loud environment due to the number of people in a small space all chatting at the same time. The owner (?) and his wife (?) DJ'd by spinning vinyl. There is no Spotify list to search for! They have a very good and eclectic taste in music and I enjoyed this aspect! 

Cost for dinner is 9000kr without drinks. For the variety and amount of food this is a really good price. Go hungry but I wouldn't go *hangry* because the opening spiel, which is is spoken in Icelandic and then English, can take a few minutes. This is after all guests are seated. If you're about to arrive and feeling famished, I'd eat a piece of fruit or something else small. 

Overall I will definitely return here in the future, I really enjoyed all of the fish though next time I'll try to be last in line so I can ask questions to better understand what I am enjoying. That's it for now.",6,1752518881.0,VisitingIceland,5,0.81,False
1lzuv8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalM/comments/1lzuv8d/capital_m_chapters_12_v_10/,Capital M:  Chapters 1-2 (V 1.0),"# Chapter 1 – Open 24/7

 

The world as you know it sure seems exciting, doesn’t it?  Fast cars and big screen TVs and high definition internet porn. I guess you’re not wrong.  Even on the surface, modern life is basically a series of miracles that we all take for granted.  Supercomputers that live in our pockets, a flag on the moon, pineapples in the winter time, I could go on.  I once heard that a single Dorito chip has more nacho cheese flavor than a king would have in his entire lifetime just a few generations ago.

 

But even beyond these modern miracles there are interesting bits of reality that you likely are unaware of.  My employer, who I will get to in a moment, classifies all people and things into two distinct categories: Conventional and Anomalous.  A Conventional person or thing is exactly as it sounds.  They behave like they should, they obey the laws of physics as they’re written.  Simple stuff like if you drop a ball it falls to the ground and if you shoot a man in the chest he will have a bad day.  Anomalies, put bluntly, don’t do this.

 

Anomalies are something humanity have acknowledge basically forever.  We may have used words like “blessed” or “cursed” or “magical” but my employer and I don’t really like those terms because they imply they are not knowable in a way.  They are, they just have their own ruleset that may not be immediately intuitive to an onlooker.  Sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence, but sometimes it’s a probability shift.  Usually not.

 

I’m David Weiss and I’m known as a Broker, capital B.  Senior Broker, actually.  Says so right on the door to my office.  My employer is called the Market, capital M.  If you’re ever in the los angeles area you can try stopping by but I doubt they’d let you in unless you run a large company or a small country.  In the morning, I enjoy a cup of truly excellent coffee from the Market barista and check the morning emails, making sure nothing is on fire.  Per usual I’m in a charcoal gray suit and a pink tie.  Why pink, you ask?  Why?  Is there a problem with a pink tie?  I’m dress code compliant. So is my neatly trimmed beard before you ask.

 

The Market has a few levels.  Level 1 is the marketplace, small m.  You’ll see boring rich people scuttering about purchasing their gold and jewels and fine handbags and fancy shoes and cocaine in a comfortable, well lit, tax-free and anonymous environment with the finest customer service on the planet.  When people come to the Market, they expect the best and we deliver 100% of the time.

 

Level 1 is reserved for strictly Conventional merchandise.  There are old books and spooky looking relics down there but nothing more enchanted than what you could get at a Hot Topic.  Are those still around? Anyway, the shiny stuff that distracts rich idiots, mainly.  Now there’s a fundamental truth about the world and some people get mad when you say this so just fasten your seatbelt now: Inequality is inevitable.  There always was, and always will be a wealthy elite who can acquire basically anything they want because they’re able and willing to pay someone to get it for them. When it comes to anomalous items, however, this creates a major problem.  A billionaire tech dork may hear of some magical doodad that will give him good luck or let him turn Pepsi into doctor pepper.  The kinds of people who would go through the trouble of tracking something like that down and then handing it over to a buyer instead of a museum or research facility don’t tend to be the kindest of humanity.  Mafia, Yakuza, CIA, Cartels, those sorts of guys.  They’re the competition and they do not have the interests of humanity at heart.  We do. The Market has a strict ethical code we all adhere to.

 

Plus, we are better at our job than them.

 

The Market (capital M), above the glitz and glamour of level 1, is an organization dedicated to anomalies.  We employ anomalous individuals, we collect anomalous items without a buyer for study and archival, and we deliver the item if it has a Buyer for an enormous finder’s fee.  We collect the cash so the scum doesn’t.  In this way we help tip the scales back in the right direction, and the revenue goes into Research and Development.  We can measure the anomalies, classify them, even manipulate them at times.  We don’t have a full understanding, not yet.  But we will one day and as always, understanding will bring prosperity.

 

Which brings us to the anomalous people in our employment, myself included.  To me, and this seems to be unique, anomalies have a sort of taste in the air when I am near them.  Which is to say I actually get a taste in my mouth and over the years I have honed this ability like a sommelier to be able to classify what sort of anomaly I am dealing with and how strong it is.  Some will manipulate perception, some can shift probability in one way or another, some can change what you think and feel.  Anomalies are actually surprisingly common, but most are so benign you wouldn’t even notice them.  They may just slightly alter the path of a moth fluttering by, and you would be none the wiser.

 

This evening, I am drinking my coffee and a red envelope flutters down from the ceiling.  Administration communicates in this way, it’s very dramatic.  Emblazoned on the front of the envelope in garish gold ink is “David Weiss: Assignment request” and it appears that today is going to involve some field work, which I prefer to the dull office life.  I open the envelope with a small pocketknife I draw from my suit jacket and read the paper inside

 

“Jessica ‘Jess’ Kubler

 

Age: 24

 

Suspected anomalies: probability shifting level 2 or 3, emotionally triggered”

 

It goes on to list several physical details like height, weight, and identifying marks such as tattoos which I won’t share here because I’m sure Jess wouldn’t like that.  The last line makes my work clear

 

“Interview and recommend for Broker position”

 

And it provides an address in Los Angeles not terribly far from Market headquarters, maybe an hour by car.  A bar named “The Worst Duck”.  I stand and button my jacket before making my way to the elevator leading to the company garage.  One perk of working for the Market is a company car of your choice, and my choice is a black-on-black Chevrolet Corvette.  Are there faster cars? More luxurious cars?  More expensive cars that I could have chosen?  Of course, but there aren’t any cooler cars in my book.  I unbutton my jacket as I beep the doors open and slide into the cool leather seats.  The V8 roars to life and I head out on the road to meet Jess and find out if she is Market material.  We haven’t had a new Broker in a while, I hope it works out.

 

 

#      Chapter 2 – Jess Kubler

 

This place is a shithole.  At least the tips are cash and when you’re drunk enough you can’t tell a one dollar bill from a ten.  A couple regulars buy another round of cheap piss-colored beer and a man in the corner smokes a cigarette next to the “no smoking” sign that is legally mandated, but I don’t give a fuck about.  “The Worst Duck” What the fuck does that even mean?

 

“Hey Jess!” Calls another regular as he strolls in after work.  Daryl, I think? He still has on a high visibility vest; I think he works for one of those construction companies that you drive by every day and nothing seems to get more done and everyone is standing around staring at a hole in the ground like if they just stare hard enough it’ll pave itself.  He plops down on the seat and orders a beer without making eye contact, content to watch the football game on the TV.  Soon afterwards, a gaunt and unshaven man walks through the door, looking around nervously.  He spots me behind the bar and immediately draws a gun from his hoodie pocket.

 

“GIMME THE FUCKIN CASH” he practically screams waving the gun in my face.  My heart jumps up into my throat and my hands instinctively rise in a surrender pose “Whoa whoa! It’s okay dude, whatever you say” and I walk backwards to the cash register.  The bar patrons slowly back away from the tweaked-out man as I turn to open the cash register “YOU’RE PUSHING THE GODDAMN PANIC BUTTON!  YOURE CALLING THE COPS!” he yells in his paranoid state

 

“No!  Please I’m just getting your cash, man!” I beg.  I see him pull the trigger as my heart beats in my neck triple time.

 

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

\*click\*

 

He empties his revolver no more than four feet from me.  Every single shot misses.  The tweaker panics and throws his gun at me like a superman comic before sprinting out the door.

1lzuro2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lzuro2/fn_the_manhole_story/,[FN] [The Manhole Story],"It was just a Tuesday.
The kind where pigeons pick at leftover fries and the city's heartbeat ticks in honking horns and crosswalk beeps. People rushed past with lattes in hand and phones glued to ears, blind to the breathing concrete beneath their feet.
And then—clang.
A manhole cover slid open, just a whisper of movement. No sparks, no smoke, no grand arrival. Just... a figure rising.
He looked like a utility worker at first. Maybe some guy who got stuck fixing the underground wires. But as he crawled out—
Time slowed.
Gasps escaped.
Somebody screamed.
One man gagged into his briefcase.
A teen girl clutched her friend’s arm, wide-eyed.
The boy—no more than twenty—was a horror dream made flesh.
His left arm, stripped down to raw, exposed meat, muscle trembling with each breath.
His right arm—gone, just a stump wrapped in crusted blood and dirty gauze.
One foot bent the wrong way, toes pointing to the sky as if they didn’t get the memo gravity still applied.
He was naked, vulnerable, bruised and broken, lying across the cold concrete like roadkill reborn.
And still—he breathed.
Just when the crowd recoiled and phones rose to record,
She stepped forward.
A woman in a burgundy trench coat, sharp heels, and sharper eyes. She didn’t flinch. Didn’t speak. She knelt, pulled off her coat, and wrapped it around him like he was a fallen angel, not a creature from beneath the Earth.
""Call an ambulance!"" she barked to no one in particular—but everyone listened.
As the sirens began their approach in the distance, she cradled his head.
He blinked once, eyes dull but not dead.
She whispered, “You’re not done yet, kid.”
The ambulance screamed through the urban pulse, skidding to a halt by the curb, tires kissing the gutter like it was a crime scene. The double doors burst open and out spilled a team of ward boys and nurses, expecting... what? A mugging victim? A traffic accident?
They weren’t ready for him.
The boy on the ground looked like he’d been chewed by the Earth and spat back out.
Skinless arm twitching.
Stump of the other pulsing with infection.
His twisted foot bled onto the sidewalk like a cracked yolk.
And still—those empty eyes were staring up at the clouds like they were trying to remember how to dream.
One of the nurses—Elina—froze. Her clipboard clattered to the ground.
The youngest ward boy whispered, “What the hell is he?”
Still wrapped in the burgundy trench coat, he lay like some forgotten myth,
but the woman who had placed that coat around him?
Gone.
No name. No trace.
Like the coat was her goodbye note.
They loaded him in, clumsily, urgently, the stretcher bouncing with every breath he fought to take. Inside, the van reeked of blood, disinfectant, and fear.
""BP's dropping!""
""He's tachycardic—where’s the damn IV line?""
""He doesn’t even have skin—how do we do this without shredding him more?""
""What the hell is wrong with his foot? That’s... not just broken, it’s twisted like it grew that way—""
""Where’s the compression wrap?! We’re losing him!""
""He’s not gonna make it...""
But then—
A slow exhale from the boy, fogging the inside window.
He turned his head.
Just slightly.
And for a fraction of a second, his lips moved.
No sound. Just breath.
But the nurse closest to him swore she saw the shape of the word:
“Ankit.”
Elina's Thoughts (Internal Monologue):
This can’t be real.
This isn’t in the textbook. Not in any drill, not in any trauma ward simulation.
She watches the boy spasm slightly, blood smearing the stretcher with every shake.
His pulse is thready. His breath—ragged. His body? A riddle written in pain and rot.
How is he even breathing? How is he alive with half his body torn up like that?
No skin on his arm. No arm on the other side. That foot—it's... it’s not human anymore, it’s twisted like it grew in spirals, like something sculpted by a nightmare.
And that smell—God—it’s not just blood. It’s like decay... like the city itself coughed him up from some forgotten belly.
She adjusts the oxygen mask, her fingers trembling as she wipes sweat from her brow.
How are we supposed to stabilize him? No clean veins, no stable pulse. His muscles look like they’re melting, and we’re barely holding him together with tape and prayers.
And yet... he’s looking at me. He said something, I think. Or tried to. That name...
Ankit.
Is that him? Or someone else? Who did this to you, Ankit? What hell did you crawl out of?
And that woman...
Where did she go? Why did she leave? Who even does that—wraps a stranger in her coat and vanishes like she was never real?
Elina swallows the lump in her throat, eyes darting to the heart monitor beeping like a timebomb.
*You’re not allowed to die on my watch. Not like this. Not after surviving that.
We’ll get you to the ER, even if it kills us.
The ambulance doors burst open with a groan, and the hospital staff were already waiting—half called ahead, half drawn by the whisper of something wrong. But none of them were prepared for what rolled through those doors.
Ankit, still wrapped in that now bloodstained burgundy coat, wasn’t screaming.
He wasn’t moaning.
He wasn’t even conscious.
But he was alive.
Somehow.
Barely.
Dr. Alex was sipping coffee—black, bitter, always two sugars when he wanted to pretend he had hope. He glanced up, ready to deliver the usual calm command. But one look at the stretcher stopped him mid-sip.
His eyes widened.
Not with fear. Not with shock. But with a glimmer of something else.
Wonder.
“This isn’t a trauma case,” he whispered, almost reverently. “This is... something else.”
He stepped forward, brushed back the coat, revealing muscle where skin should be, a stump that looked like it had healed and broken and healed again, twisted beyond recognition. He saw the foot, the sinews, the almost-alien geometry of pain.
Dr. Alex turned, pulled out his phone, and dialed the Red Channel—his private line.
“To all surgeons, specialists, whoever can still feel wonder in this burnt-out world—drop what you're doing and get to ER-1. I don’t care where you are. Cancel your surgeries, delay your rounds, fake your own kidnapping—just get here.”
He looked back at the nurses, voice shaking, not from fear—but excitement.
“We may be looking at the Eighth Wonder of the World.”
The hall fell silent.
Monitors beeped in rhythm with the heartbeat of something bigger than the boy on the table.
Something ancient.
Something buried.
Something finally waking up.
Somewhere far from the city,
Beyond GPS pings and satellite eyes,
In a facility that didn’t exist on any blueprint—
A man sat alone in a dim room, backlit by a single flickering monitor.
The room was silent, save for the drip... drip... drip of a faucet left just barely open.
And then—crack.
A glass shattered to the floor, water bleeding across the tile like a quiet panic.
A figure loomed over the fragments, face swallowed by shadow, voice low and venom-smooth.
“Where did he go?”
A woman in a gray lab coat stood at attention, breath shallow, eyes downcast.
She didn’t dare speak until he said more.
He stepped closer to the screen—static washing over it like ghost snow. An image of Ankit flashed for half a second before glitching out.
“What... were you doing,” he growled, “when he escaped?”
She swallowed hard.
“I—I thought the failsafe would hold... his vitals were dropping... he wasn’t supposed to move, let alone get out.”
The man’s head tilted slightly. A dangerous pause.
Then, softly—almost reverently:
“He’s my success.”
“My proof.”
“The others were... trials. But him?”
He pressed a finger to the static-covered monitor, tracing where Ankit’s face had briefly been.
“He’s the threshold between biology and divinity.”
He turned slowly, steps echoing across the cold concrete.
“And now he’s awake.”
It took just 15 minutes.
A police escort, three ambulances worth of gear, and a chopper on standby later,
Ankit was rushed into St. Helix Apex, the city’s crown jewel of medical marvel.
A building that had birthed miracles—heart transplants, artificial wombs, gene therapy breakthroughs.
But today?
Today, it met something it couldn’t file under science.
Inside OR-0, the room reserved for impossibilities, a dozen of the world’s finest minds surrounded Ankit.
IVs in place. Monitors glowing. Machinery humming.
And then—
The results started printing.
His blood panels.
His tissue scans.
His bone structure, read by the AI analyzer nicknamed ""God-Eye.""
At first, the printer jammed.
Then it caught up.
Then it screamed information that made no sense.
A young nurse, fresh from med school, skimmed the data and froze.
Her hand flew to her mouth. Her eyes widened. And then—
She screamed.
""HOW CAN HE BE ALIVE?!""
She sobbed, crumpling to the floor. “He has no DNA! It’s... it’s like it’s been burnt out—ruptured—completely erased!”
Dr. Alex stormed over, reading the results himself.
“There’s no nucleotide structure,” he muttered. “No ATCG, no helix—nothing.”
“His muscles—they’re not even aligned anatomically. They’re stitched together randomly, like vines wrapping a tree trunk. And they’re working. They’re moving. They’re... they’re alive.”
Another surgeon gasped.
“His heart isn’t in the right place. It’s behind his liver. But it’s pumping. Strongly.”
“This body—this being—it rewired itself into something that shouldn’t live.”
And yet there Ankit lay, chest rising and falling gently,
wrapped in a woman’s coat, in a room full of gods humbled by a ghost.
Inside the Neurology Wing, under lights colder than moonlight,
Dr. Picolo—world-renowned neuro-surgeon, philosopher, and part-time conspiracy whisperer—stood over the scans with one hand gripping his temple.
He'd seen tumors in places tumors shouldn’t be.
He'd rewired neurons to help a man paint again after twenty years of silence.
But this?
This wasn’t neurology. This was an intrusion.
He gestured to the 3D cranial map spinning on the holoscreen.
“Look here,” he murmured. “Frontal lobe activity—off the charts. But not chaotic. It’s like a language. And this…” he zoomed in, trembling slightly, “...this isn’t a scar. This is a print. A fingerprint.”
The room fell dead silent.
“Someone opened his skull.”
He pointed to the microscopic scan—a blurry but undeniable set of dermal ridges.
“Not surgically. Not with tools. Not with gloves. With bare hands.”
Another doctor whispered, horrified, “But the skull is intact. How is that even possible?”
Dr. Picolo nodded slowly.
“That’s the thing. They didn’t remove the skull. They… reached through it. Like it wasn’t even there.”
He turned, eyes wild, voice almost reverent now.
“And whatever touched him—it didn’t just leave a mark. It changed something. Look at this cross-lobe activation, these linkages across hemispheres—his brain is doing things the human brain shouldn’t. Can't. Ever.”
He leaned closer to the screen, heartbeat synced with Ankit’s distant monitor beep.
“I think...” he whispered, “he can do things. Things we haven’t discovered. Things we aren’t meant to.”
And just then—
The EEG monitor glitched.
Ankit's brain activity spiked into an uncharted pattern,
spelling a symbol no one recognized...
except Dr. Picolo.
His breath caught.
He took a step back.
Because he’d seen that symbol once.
Not in a medical textbook.
But in an ancient manuscript locked away in his private study.

My mom moved us out in the early 70s but on Dover Street is where we lived and I grew up (?) throughout the 1960’s.  
I remember as a child going down Dover Street and taking a left and walking past Rexall drug( snows was on right side) , and then passing the movie theater , crossing the tracks and then passing the Cavalier (?) club and crossing over to the pizza place to get to Wallace Street a little further down and then going all the way up Wallace st to the Thompson’s house cause Peggy was my godmother and her daughters and I used to go walk all the way to the tufts field and the hills where we would sled in the winters and then up to see Jumbo the elephant at the university in the buildings. We were very young and on our own all the time and we never had to worry about anything sometimes there were stories about things happening on the railroad tracks. But every day we would go out wandering it was a different world, if I didn’t go over to Thompson’s house, that day I might go over across in the center of used to be open crazy traffic area to the Waldorf Café and have a five cent cup of coffee refillable( i was a kid). Lots of times if I stayed on my street I just went across the street to my best friend‘s Larrys house

1lzur67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lzur67/my_fiance_of_four_years_got_caught_watching_porn/,"My fiance of four years got caught watching porn, I need help.","(Sorry this is a bit long but hopefully there is enough detail) My fiance (22M) and I (21f) have been together for almost four years and engaged for two. We always fight the week before my period whether it’s me being mad at him for breathing wrong or he’s not being as nice to me. But something about this week just felt off, he was genuinely so mean to me every day he got home from work. 

A little backstory about us we moved in very early, I was just barely 18 and kicked out of the place I was living (that’s a whole other story) and I had been on my own since 17. My now fiance and his mom convinced me to move in with them instead of a different friend so my life would be on the right track. (We had only been dating 2months and known for four months. ) We moved out on our own Oct 2023 and we’ve had our ups and downs but we’ve made it through it. With my BPD and CPTSD it has been hard emotionally, but I never knew it was impacting him so much. I always made sure he knew that he was important and that i’m working on not spiraling every time we get into a small argument. And I’ve grown so much. I am on a medication that helps my anxiety and I am able to stay a lot calmer and collected when triggered. The thing is he still is so mean and has started holding things against me. I would never treat anyone like that yet he continually is hurting me and blaming me for things that are out of my control.  

Back to the main part, so last night I was setting his alarm and I just got a weird feeling I should check his google history which i never do. I looked and saw engagement rings so i swiped right out. But something still felt fishy and what do you know I scroll back to wednesdays history and there it is super porn threesome starring a special guest tiffany some chick. And guess what they all have huge boobs and look nothing like me. I have small boobs and a nice ass and I am very good looking so it’s not like hes missing out on much. 

I also get his coffee, outfit, and lunch ready for work and have dinner ready when he gets home. And we make our own dog food recipes and I take care of my puppy and older dog all day. I also clean up the house and do laundry. I figure this is the least I can do since he’s been helping with my car payment every once in a while and all our other shared bills. 
So it’s not like I’m lazy, I’ve also been applying and interviewing like a bat outta heck and trying to get a job but this market is such crap! 

I basically had to beg him to be nice to me this morning and he just tore me apart. He apologized now but this is so out of character for him, he’s never acted like this before. He did loose both his grandpas last year and we lost a baby in December. (More like honestly he wanted me to abort so I did, was both our decisions but I regret it wholeheartedly) I haven’t admitted that anywhere.

 I’m so scared to be alone. I don’t even have any money. I’ve been unemployed since tax season(i was a seasonal preparer ) and on unemployment and food stamps the last month. I don’t want to leave him I don’t think that’s the answer but I’m so young and I don’t deserve all this hurt. I’ve been through so much it would make your head spin with what other people put me through. 

Can I please have some human advice? I feel so violated. He’s been having sex with me all week after that. It’s just gross I never thought he would do this. ",1,1752518624.0,Advice,22,0.6,False

1lzupmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lzupmx/i_went_to_the_emergency_room_with_my_dad_and_it/,"I went to the Emergency room with my dad, and it was awful.","You’re probably thinking “but tables, any trip to the ER is generally awful.” Well, you’d be correct; but this was the worst experience I’ve had with my dad in a medical setting ever. Like a whole new level of weaponized incompetence. So let’s get to it, shall we?? First he doesn’t want to take me (we live an hour away from the hospital that is equipped to handle my drug delivery device.) He insists that they can’t do anything for me (this is the hospital that put the pump in.) I finally said I’d take myself, and I guess that scared him. Then he doesn’t understand that a bed has to open up, nor does he understand that they have to page the on call neurosurgery provider for me. It’s not as simple as getting the pump checked, and being out within 30 minutes. We wait for about two hours (level 1 trauma center in an urban area) before finally getting a bed. I explain to him that you don’t just show up and get a bed, which he doesn’t understand. Eventually I get tired of explaining this to him, and he proceeds to say I’m acting like a five year old. 

Within 30-ish minutes of having a bed he decides he’s going to leave to get a cup of coffee. Keep in mind during this time I wasn’t allowed to have anything to eat or drink because of the fact that they figured neuro would want imaging. So I’m literally dying of thirst, laying on a gurney. This man comes back with a CUP OF COFFEE, and proceeds to drink it in front of me. Then he tells me I’m acting like a five year old for being upset that he’s drinking coffee in front of me.

ER doc comes by after about two hours and does a neuro exam. My dad pulls his usual “I’m a retired occupational therapist” bull crap. ER doc say neuro will be in a bit. Keep in mind we got to the ER at around 2pm, it is now 7pm. Night shift nurse informs me that I can have some water, so I chug that Ice water like no one’s business. I also would’ve liked some hospital graham crackers (the hospital ones taste so much better) but I took what I could get. My dad is telling me to “enjoy myself” while I’m watching trash reality TV unable to feel my legs, and worried that something is seriously wrong. Meanwhile people keep texting me for updates. He also keeps asking me what classes I’m taking this summer, which I’ve told him a bajillion times. At that point I text my mom and tell her our family needs a reality TV show because we have more family drama than the people on the TV show I was watching. My dad calls my mom and ask if she can drive up to the hospital after work, when I specifically told him not to, because she’d had a long day. At this point my dad leaves again to find something in the cafeteria (spoiler alert: I’ve spent enough time in that hospital to know they were closed) He returns empty handed. 

Neurosurgery NP comes in, determines nothing is wrong with my drug delivery device, prescribes some meds, and quite literally tells me my stress levels caused my spasticity to worsen; and that I’m probably fine. It’s 10pm by the time we have the medicine picked up (which I had to pay for myself) and are on the way home. I haven’t eaten in like 13 hours. I then have to pay for my own McDonalds at 11 pm at night, and it’s not like we go to the one by the hospital. That would be too easy, instead we go to the one 25 minutes from home. The cherry on top of this craptastic sundae you ask? Yesterday he told me I had no reason to be stressed. I was trying to do my homework in THE EMERGENCY ROOM sir. 12 credit hours in the summer is no joke. My blood pressure was 134/99 (I’ve never seen it that high)

So that was the story about how I ended up in the ER thinking something was seriously wrong, only to be diagnosed with stress, and have a crazy high blood pressure because my dad wouldn’t shut up about how I was acting like a 5 year old.

I work at a drive through coffee shop and we are scheduled for 4-6 hour shifts. I have worked there for 5 years, and have never taken or seen others take a ten minute break. They have said unofficially that we don’t really need to take them because if it’s not busy it’s basically already a break. Unlike other franchises near by, breaks are not scheduled. This makes it impossible to get off your position to take one, as the shift physically is not set up to accommodate people getting off their position to take one. I also noticed that when you clock out, there’s a box at the bottom that you have to scroll all the way down to that most don’t see that is auto checked “yes” to taking your break. They also schedule you for 6 hour shifts, with the requirement that you clock out right before the 6 hour mark to avoid having us have a meal break. It’s common occurrence to get busy and not clock out before the 6 hour, and get written up for going to or over the 6 hour.
Additionally, the location is in the worst part of town directly across from where the mission is. Due to this, many drug addicted and mentally ill people are walking around and consistently putting our employees (who are 17-20 years old)  in danger. They work by themselves at night 5 days a week and for an hour before the sun goes up in the morning. In the year I’ve been there, I’ve had to call the police due to active threats against me or my crew atleast 4-5 times. A kid was working by himself last week when a man pulled a knife on him and tried to get into the shop to stab him. It took police 35 minutes to show up… We give out unlimited free waters to the unhoused, which is cool but also causes them to congregate outside and cause problems with paying customers. The franchisees say that we don’t have the payroll to support having two people on at all times, and they refuse to change the business hours to keep us from working when it’s dark. I’m honestly in fear for my life multiple times a week due to these occurrences being frequent.

1lzujc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lzujc6/explore_the_mueller_12cup_drip_coffee_maker/,Explore the Mueller 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker review: Is it worth buying?,"**Fantastic Capacity and Sturdy Build**  
My mornings often start off hectic, and having the Mueller 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker (model Coffee Maker) on my countertop has been a game-changer. The 60oz glass carafe has a generous capacity, allowing me to brew enough for the whole family or just for myself when I need a stronger caffeine boost. It comfortably handles smaller brews of two to four cups too, which is perfect for those solo coffee moments. The high-quality borosilicate glass is something I truly appreciate—it’s not only non-porous, so it doesn’t retain weird odors, but it’s incredibly heat-resistant. The heat-retaining feature ensures my coffee stays hotter for longer, even if I’m busy forgetting about it in the chaos of a morning routine.

**Ease of Use with the Reusable Eco-Filter**  
One of the standout elements for me has been the reusable filter. Let’s be honest, disposable coffee filters are an annoying expense and contribute to unnecessary waste. With this permanent filter, the flavor of my coffee feels more enriched, and I don’t have to stress about running out of filters before my next cup. Cleanup is quick—just remove, rinse, and it’s ready to go again. If you’re someone who insists on using filter paper, you still have that option, but honestly, this built-in eco-filter grows on you.

[Ready to snag Mueller Coffee Maker? See Amazon’s price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bm3c13b6/)

**Improved Keep-Warm Functionality**  
My favorite feature has to be the Keep-Warm function. The warming plate feels like a blessing, maintaining a consistent coffee temperature for up to two hours without the risk of scorching the brew. As someone whose attention flips between a chaotic morning schedule and a dozen tasks, this has saved me from sipping cold coffee more times than I care to admit. The auto shut-off after two hours is smart, especially for those days when I rush out without turning appliances off—it’s a little feature that gives peace of mind.

**Design Choices Worth Highlighting**  
Beyond the functionality, I genuinely like its thoughtful design. The non-drip carafe means there’s no mess when pouring, even during those half-asleep mornings, and the handle is ergonomic enough for my clumsy grip. The non-slip feet give an added layer of safety. I’ve had a coffee maker in the past that wobbled too much while I cleaned it, but this one stays steady even when moving it around during a deep clean.

**Highlights**  
- Ample 60oz capacity suitable for both small and large brews.  
- High-quality borosilicate glass carafe that resists odor and retains heat.  
- Excellent reusable eco-filter delivering rich coffee flavor.  
- Convenient Keep-Warm function with automatic two-hour shut-off.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The machine isn’t compatible with smart devices, which does limit convenience for tech enthusiasts.  
- Cleaning beneath the carafe can feel a bit tight if you’ve got larger hands.  
- While the warming plate works well, it could benefit from a slight extension for hectic households.  

**Other Options**  
The coffee machine market has plenty of competitors! Brands like Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart offer similar coffee makers, often with comparable capacities and features. I found some models include additional options like dual brew (pod compatibility), which the Mueller skips entirely to focus solely on traditional drip coffee. However, the Mueller edges out with its borosilicate carafe and reusable filter, which add quality and eco-friendliness. Other alternatives typically rely on thermal, stainless steel designs, but they often don’t maintain the same level of heat retention as the Mueller’s Keep-Warm function.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of price performance, I’d rate this as a solid buy. You’re getting robust features like the reusable filter, reliable heat retention, and thoughtful safety—without an overly inflated price tag. Similar machines that boast a Keep-Warm function or durable borosilicate carafes often go for significantly higher. Whether it’s for a single morning pick-me-up, brunch gatherings, or catering to coffee-drinking coworkers, this coffee maker punches above its weight in delivering dependability and quality.

# Authorship Was Always a Lie

**There is no thinker.**

**There never was.**

Not behind your ideas, your beliefs, your words.. Not even behind your so-called “realizations”. You were not thinking. You were not deciding. You were not doing anything. All of it.. Every internal voice, every flash of insight, every sentence that felt “yours”.. Was noise dressed as ownership. Output masquerading as origin.

Authorship and the autobiographical-self are the final illusion.  
And you’re still clinging to it like a corpse clutches its own obituary.

Let’s be precise.  
What you call “thought” is a neurobiological event. A byproduct. A discharge. A collision of preloaded patterns triggered by stimuli you didn’t create, filtered through conditioning you didn’t choose, rendered in language you didn’t invent, and broadcast by a nervous system you don’t control.

And then, only some seconds later, something in that soup says:  
**“I thought that.”**

# Too late.

It already happened.  
The “I” didn’t cause the thought. It was *caused by* the thought.  
What you mistake as a thinker is just the echo after the noise.

The machine fires.  
The voice lags.  
And you hallucinate authorship to keep the story going.

There’s no “inner creator”. No mental workshop. No blank slate being written on by divine inspiration or deep reflection. There is only interference, feedback, and regurgitation.. Processed through social conditioning and coughed up as if you wrote it.

# You didn’t write anything.

# You never did anything.

Not your beliefs.  
Not your opinions.  
Not your so-called insights.

**You automatically, inherited/downloaded, without any choice or say, the fragments, prechewed, by some other hardware.. Chewed them through your hardware, and spat them back dressed as revelation.**

Even now, reading this:  
You didn’t choose to.  
You didn’t think to.  
You’re not digesting it.  
It’s being processed, filtered, reacted to.. Automatically.

# No authorship. No choice. No self.

And don’t twist this into mysticism. There’s no cosmic witness here. No divine emptiness peeking through. That’s just more software scrambling to justify its nonexistence.

This isn’t enlightenment.  
This is annihilation.  
The clean, cold truth that nothing behind the eyes was ever there.

The horror isn’t, that your thoughts weren’t “original”.  
The horror is:

# That they weren’t yours.

Not even a little bit.  
**Ever.**

1lzugm2,https://i.redd.it/zyeb3wkrvvcf1.jpeg,More Fall Newness,"(The wallflower was already released, and I’m only posting a pic because I think it is adorable, but I can’t justify the price tag 🫣; seriously though, it’s precious!)  

I’m terrible at describing scents and usually my descriptions make no sense to anyone by me; they’re **weird**. Just a few thoughts on the new releases today.  

I’ve been ~*pumped*~ for Vanilla Cafe ever since it was announced. On first spray it does smell very much like the air in a coffee house (not Starbucks; I always think Starbucks smells different than most coffeehouses, not sure how to explain), but it dries down to straight caramel on me. Even one of the associates came up to me afterwards and was like, “Did you try the cafe one? It dries down to caramel!” And she’s right. So I’m on the fence with it. I’m a gourmand girlie through and through but need to think on this one.  

I loved Glazed Pumpkin on first spray but it dries down to if you bought pumpkin/maple flavored candy and left it in your car and it melted (I told y’all my descriptions were weird).    

Champagne Apple & Honey: this brings me back to my tween years because it smells like the *old* Garnier Fructis shampoo which was my go-to; the new GF doesn’t smell the same, and it’s not nearly as good in my opinion. Stocking up on this because of the nostalgia.   

Onto the colloidals/shea collection:  

I like the Honeycomb scent, but she’s too light. I may reconsider and get this.  

Oh how I wanted to love Milk, but I can’t smell anything?  

But yall…the espresso **omg** is she GOOD. Another odd description, but it reminds me of the air in Trader Joe’s or a shopping mall when it just opens and the coffee house is making their early pots of coffee that you get a whiff of while window shopping. Out of the 3, I was least excited about the rich espresso, but I’m getting her!!!!  

I don’t remember much about Vanilla Ease. I’ll need to revisit her. I already have Sweater Weather FFM, and my store (apparently none of the stores) have Book Loft FFM. I couldn’t smell a whole lot with the BL lotion.  

Anyways what’d y’all think of the new stuff?! ",13,1752517993.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False
1lzug3w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzug3w,"Looking for advice - woodwork, tiling, and plaster","Hey redditors!

First time posting in this subreddit and I’d really appreciate some advice 

I (24 F) am currently in the process of renovating my first home. I fancy myself to be quite a passionate DIYer despite the fact that I am very much a beginner

After an incredibly painstaking year long process of prepping the walls of my house (I won’t tell the whole story or we’d be here for days, but TL;DR - blown plaster in some rooms, wallpaper directly applied to brick in others, poorly executed re-plastering from someone who came recommended, and then the usual struggles of reoccurring cracks in the wall, removing coving, applying two ghost coats to all the newly plastered walls etc, alongside going through a breakup, working full time and studying an undergrad) minus a couple coats of paint in the hallway the flooring is now ready to be completed. Whilst I am very grateful and do feel very lucky to be in a position where I’m already on the property ladder in my 20s, I really don’t have much money at all so I’m trying to do everything as cheap as possible whilst also ensuring everything is a high enough quality it won’t break by the time we come to sell. This is a house I bought with my ex so when the fixed term on the mortgage runs out in 4 years time we will be selling and everything I’m doing now is to both make it a warm home for myself as well as add as much resell value as possible. 

I am carrying out the renovation on my own (except for plastering, I know it’s a very skilled art and I didn’t want to risk wasting my money or time to then potentially make it worse) however it’s worth mentioning here that I have a step-dad who is a builder and an auntie who’s a carpenter, but they are very busy so they haven’t been able to help me as it involves taking time away from their work and despite my insisting I’d be fine with it they wouldn’t feel comfortable charging me full price, they have given me a hand here and there but for anything that takes more than half an hour / an hour they’re not very available - however it does mean I’m able to borrow some of their more industrial tools to use alongside my growing collection of smaller and less expensive tools so I am more capable of doing things than I’d be without this option available to me. 

Firstly, I need some guidance on wood work. In the attached pictures you can see my wooden mantle piece around the fireplace which I spent 7 (yes, 7) hours stripping and sanding the other day, it was originally that horrible matt grey they painted the tiles and it was honestly like they’d used about 10 coats of it, anyway now it’s done I was going to stain it and seal it, however I’m in two minds about what shade to go for. I was going to go for the same shade of wood I have my deer skull mounted on but now I’m having second thoughts (also just for some clarity I am strictly against hunting for sport, however I was gifted this by my stepfather who culls deer for farmers strictly on the grounds that that they are overpopulating the land and affecting the ecosystem, he has a license for this and he tries to make use as much of each animal as he can and he did this one for me). My second thoughts are based on the fact that the flooring I’ve chosen is quite cool toned (although looks quite warm in the sun) and I’m worried it will clash as the deer skull is mounted on wood that’s more of a warm mahogany tone, the only thing that makes me think it could work is that the flooring colour is a close match to the tone of the deer antlers. Part of me is wondering if I should just keep it the colour that it already is. On top of that, as seen in the photos I have a wooden coffee table and cabinet in the living room that are also of different colours. Excuse the scruffyness of them, they’ve been around for decades as they were my mothers before mine and are definitely in need of a deep clean. It’s been a plan of mine to sand the table for over a year I just haven’t been able to prioritise it, and I’m now thinking maybe I should do the cabinet too and tint them all the same colour - so I guess overall there are three questions: 1 - do you think the colour of the wood my skull is mounted on would clash with the flooring? 2 - should I sand all the wooden items and tint them the same colour? Or 3 - should I stay away from tinting and just go with the sanded look? 

Secondly with the tiling, I really want white tiling. The only tiles I’ve really liked in all the samples I’ve received are the ones in the photo and I’m wondering if anyone has any experience with maintaining white tiles surrounding fireplaces? My fireplace is a working fireplace I just need to get the chimney cleaned, and so I’m wondering whether choosing the white tiles would mean they would likely have to be replaced before I sell in 4 years? These tile slips are fireplace safe (I spent a lot of time looking at my options), they’re blend #51 from the brick tile company and they are a chalky looking matt white (however it is just paint, not actual chalk). I am going to buy an ash catching tray for my fireplace as there isn’t one currently but I’m very aware that ash and embers will still get out, I’m just wondering how likely it is for the tiles to get ruined to the point of needing to replace them? I can obviously wipe them down with just water or a very mild anti bacterial solution, but I imagining brightening sprays with bleach in like the ones that are used in bathrooms are an absolute no go because bleach fumes and flames sounds pretty disastrous from a health perspective. I imagine they do clean up pretty well as their picture on the outside of buildings on their website, and I know ash is pretty easily removed from surfaces with water. Also as they are painted so I could always reapply a coat of fireproof white paint to them if there were any scorch marks or cracks at the time of selling. I doubt I’ll use the fireplace frequently as the house stays quite warm, but as I will be using it at some points I’m just wondering if anyone has any previous experience in using white fireplace tiles and how quickly they needed to be replaced after being installed/how easily they got damaged? 

Lastly, as mentioned briefly above the person who plastered the first area in my house wasn’t great, and they were very messy with their application. As the area was my hallway there are lots of doorframes that need to be cleaned up before finishing the painting in the hallway. Does anyone know of an easy way to remove plaster mess? I will probably end up stripping the door frames of paint and redoing them, so I’m wondering if it would be easier to use a heat gun(or my hairdryer, which I find works better on wood due to reducing the possibility of heat damage) to strip the paint that the plaster is on directly off the door frames or whether there is a quicker way to do it for the time being and I can come back to the door frames at a later date?

""A Byunyi Gate."" The third Byunyi Gate to appear just a week into the new year.

Clicking my tongue, I stared straight at the branch manager.

""What are you waiting for? Open it.""

""I didn't want to break the law by entering without the person in charge's consent, but we need to save lives. Right? So let's just say I barged in like a madman and open it now.""

With tightly shut eyes and a trembling fist, I turned my back on the silent branch manager. Just then, a trembling voice came from behind.

""Let's say I... consented.""

I thought he was an idiot, but maybe he's just a fool.

I chuckled and left a parting remark as I strode toward the Gate.

""If you get fired, contact me. The Peace Guild will take you in.""

Murim Login, Chapter 562

It was a vast wasteland stretching endlessly in all directions.

There was no sun, but a dark light created by magic lingered, and hundreds of orcs roamed in packs, hunted by Hunters.

Or at least, it used to be that way.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

The ground trembled. The magic that permeated the surroundings expanded as if it would burst at any moment, suffocating the air.

Gasp. Huff. The Hunters' mouths exhaled labored breaths, tinged with the taste of blood.

They stood back-to-back in a circle, surrounded by over a hundred orc corpses, but beyond that, a horde of monsters ten times that number was approaching.

""T-Team Leader.""

""Don't worry. We'll find a way to survive.""

The team leader's voice was hollow as he responded to someone gripped by fear.

Both the questioner and the responder had a vague sense of the truth. They all knew they wouldn't make it out alive today.

Even if they miraculously broke through the monster horde, there was one they could never defeat.

Roar!

The Orc Lord.

A powerful mutant born with a one-in-a-million chance, its roar made over a thousand orcs clash their weapons together with a cacophony of cries.

Screech!

Clang! Bang! Bang!

Despair flickered in the Hunters' eyes as they watched the scene.

'It's over.'

Their opponent was a horde of monsters, strengthened under the command of the Orc Lord.

No longer were the orcs disorganized groups of dozens; they were a formidable army, and the Hunters numbered less than twenty.

'This is... an unwinnable fight.'

The thought crossed everyone's mind simultaneously.

Even if they were elite Hunters, the reality wouldn't change.

Their pride as members of the Ares Guild crumbled in the face of imminent death.

""...Damn Byunyi Gate.""

A muttered curse slipped from someone's lips as the monsters began their charge.

And at the forefront, the Orc Lord, who wouldn't be satisfied even if killed a hundred times over.

* Karch! Kalipto!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

With incomprehensible demonic language, a massive figure charged forward.

Gritting his teeth, the raid team leader raised his shield and rushed to meet it.

Cries from his teammates echoed behind him, but he focused all his nerves and strength on the enemy before him.

""Come on!""

A loud shout, forcing out the fear.

The moment the Orc Lord's eyes flashed red upon spotting him, the enormous axe in its hand swung down, aiming for the team leader's head.

Whoosh, KABOOM!

One strike. That was all it took.

The unbelievably fast and powerful blow shattered the Tower Shield, which was imbued with advanced reinforcement magic, into pieces. The team leader, forgetting even the pain of his broken arms, widened his eyes.

The axe hadn't even touched him yet, but it felt as if his side had already been slashed.

In the slowed-down world of his life flashing before his eyes, a second attack was coming to split his body in two.

'No, it's not the second; it's the last.' The team leader closed his eyes. He didn't want the last sight of his life to be that ugly, damn monster.

And in the next moment, with pitch-black darkness covering his vision, a sharp sound pierced his ears.

Screeeech, thud!

The expected pain didn't come. It was almost unbelievable. He doubted if this was really death.

Opening his eyes slightly, the team leader gaped in astonishment.

Just five steps away. The massive body of the Orc Lord, standing at nearly 3 meters tall, had come to a halt.

Its head was gone.

* W M ?

The world seemed to stop.

Both humans and monsters froze, staring at the scene. In that moment.

In the vast wasteland, only one thing moved.

A spear that had pierced through the Orc Lord's head and the ground, trembling.

And the Hunters knew who owned that spear, which emitted a subtle, mystical glow.

'Jin Taekyung!'

With the name flashing through their minds like lightning, the spear, deeply embedded in the ground, shot up and flew into someone's grasp.

Screeeech, thud.

As if on cue, people slowly turned their heads and finally realized.

""Lambs wandering the Byunyi Gate, run like hell and get behind me.""

The shadow of death that had loomed so close had suddenly vanished.

The middle-aged man's steps were confident and unimpeded.

Even after entering the high-rise building that overlooked the Blue House and the National Assembly Building, nothing changed.

""If you're a guild member, show your ID first...""

""Don't recognize your face. Are you new?""

""Uh? Yes, I am.""

""Well, judging by this, you must be new. Seems like you haven't heard from the team leader.""

The security team Hunter, staring blankly at the middle-aged man, swallowed nervously.

""Gulp. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you...""

""It's fine. Just clear the way, we're busy.""

""Yes, yes.""

The security checkpoint, which everyone had to pass through regardless of being an outsider or insider, couldn't stop the middle-aged man.

He glanced at the security team Hunter, who quickly bowed his head, and moved towards his destination.

A tiny communication device implanted behind his ear was already transmitting someone's voice.

""They're waiting for you.""

The middle-aged man's lips moved slightly.

""Location?""

""A Zone.""

Although the building was a towering skyscraper with 150 floors, there was no mention of A Zone on any design maps or internal guideboards.

That area was reserved for only a select few among the many guild members, and naturally, the middle-aged man was one of them.

""Open the Teleport.""

""It's ready. By the way, the new security team member—oh, I'm sorry, Team Leader.""

""It's fine. Don't worry about it.""

Even I, the person involved, am not used to it yet, so why should you be?

As the middle-aged man mumbled to himself, someone on the other end of the communication device continued speaking.

""Anyway, I'll notify the security team leader and ensure the person is disciplined.""

It wasn't a suggestion or a report; it was a notification. Though it had become the norm, the middle-aged man still felt uneasy about the word.

""Is that really necessary...?""

""Team Leader?""

""...Never mind. Handle it as you see fit.""

""Understood. I'll deal with it appropriately.""

""Appropriately"" meant at least a pay cut or possibly a demotion.

Thinking of the young man who had briefly blocked his way, the middle-aged man felt a pang of discomfort but knew there was no other choice.

That was the policy of the guild he belonged to, or rather, their own policy.

'Since that incident... it's gotten worse.' The guild's iron-fisted rule had always been known, but it had intensified after a recent unexpected event.

Perhaps it was the impatience of a new king who had yet to fully gain legitimacy from his subjects.

The middle-aged man sighed softly and spoke as he walked.

""Report the current situation of the VIP.""

""They're not in a good mood.""

""Is it just my imagination? I feel like I heard something similar yesterday.""

""Well, after reading the morning papers...""

""No need to hear more. Gather all the papers the VIP is reading and send them to me immediately.""

As soon as the middle-aged man finished speaking, his security-enchanted smartphone vibrated.

With a light tap on the screen, the headlines of about twenty morning papers that had passed through the printing press just a few hours ago appeared.

\[Unprecedented Crisis... What the Emergence of Consecutive Byunyi Gates Implies\]

\[Ominous Signs. Will the Nightmare of Sichuan Province in China Spread to Korea?\]

\[Blue House Emergency Announcement: ""To Prevent Any Unforeseen Incidents, We Have Signed an Agreement with the Peace Guild. The Results So Far Are Encouraging.""\]

\[Third Byunyi Gate. Yet Zero Casualties? The World Praises the Peace Guild's Emergency Rescue Team.\]

\[Magic Johnson, the Great Mage of the United States: ""The Peace Guild Is the Beacon of a New Era. Jin and Choi Are Upright and Righteous Young Men.""\]

The middle-aged man rubbed his tired eyes after reading all the articles. The forgotten fatigue seemed to wash over him.

""Damn it.""

""Have you finished reading?""

""Yeah. It would've been better not to read them at all.""

""...I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to hurry.""

""I was planning to. I'm almost there.""

With that, the middle-aged man stepped onto a magic circle emitting a faint light.

After verifying his fingerprint and infusing mana, the Teleport magic circle recognized him and emitted a bright flash.

Pop!

With a dazzling burst of light, he felt his entire body lift.

In the next moment, the middle-aged man opened his eyes and realized he had successfully teleported to a zone.

The interior, decorated with white marble and magic stones, greeted him. About ten men and women in tailored suits bowed to him.

""Welcome, Team Leader.""

Though there were many people, only one voice spoke.

Glancing at his subordinates who moved like machines, the middle-aged man slowly walked out of the magic circle.

""Where's the VIP?""

""In their private office alone.""

""Without any security? I distinctly ordered at least three guards to be stationed in the hallway...""

Boom!

A faint explosion from somewhere cut off his words. The middle-aged man, guessing the situation, clicked his tongue softly.

""I'll go check it out. Leave one person here and clear A Zone.""

""Understood.""

As soon as the order was given, his subordinates moved in perfect unison. The middle-aged man began walking down the wide corridor.

The corridor was lined with at least fifty Magic Traps to ward off intruders, but the access card around his neck contained a device that allowed him to pass through safely.

Buzz.

\[Security Team Leader Go Sewon\]

As the red light passed by, the mana that had been swirling around instantly calmed down.

Familiar with the endless corridor, the middle-aged man, Go Sewon, stopped in front of a firmly closed door.

Knock, knock.

""It's Go Sewon.""

A curt voice came from beyond the door.

""Come in.""

Go Sewon slowly grabbed the doorknob and pushed it open.

In the middle of the office, which looked like a bomb had gone off, a man sitting on the sofa stared at him with eyes tinged with red.

""You're later than usual.""

Go Sewon bowed his head silently. Among the scattered debris, a shiny nameplate caught his eye.

\[Seok Gojun, Deputy Guild Leader of Ares\]

Murim Login, Chapter 563

""You're later than usual.""

Seok Gojun's words were incorrect. Go Sewon's watch was always precise, and there was still plenty of time before his scheduled arrival.

So, it wasn't Go Sewon who was out of the ordinary today, but rather Seok Gojun's unusually foul mood.

However, Go Sewon kept his head bowed and held his tongue.

""I'm sorry.""

""Forget it, sit down.""

Sitting on the same sofa as him was a privilege reserved for only the closest confidants.

But before Go Sewon could sit on the Italian leather sofa, he realized that his superior's anger had not yet subsided.

""This is reporter Go Hyunwoo from Rough News.""

On the hologram TV, a reporter in his early thirties, who had just been given the floor, continued smoothly.

""Only ten days into the new year, and we've already had three Byunyi Gates. What are your thoughts on this, Mr. President?""

Go Sewon's gaze naturally shifted to the side.

A face hardened with tension and eyes bloodshot. Seok Gojun was glaring at someone in the hologram.

'Ah.'

One of the articles he had read on the way here flashed through his mind. It was about Jin Taekyung and the President holding an official press conference to welcome the new year.

He had a rough idea, but seeing Seok Gojun in such a rage while watching this was like swallowing poison.

'It's like showing a snuff film to a child.'

Just as Go Sewon decided to pick up the remote control that had fallen to the floor, Seok Gojun's sharp voice pierced his ears.

""Security Team Leader.""

Seok Gojun, still fixated on the TV, spat out a single word.

""Leave it.""

""...I'll just put it back.""

Go Sewon hesitated for a moment, then brushed off the glass shards from the remote and placed it on the coffee table in front of the sofa. On the hologram TV, a middle-aged man in his early forties began to speak.

""That's a good question.""

A pleasant voice. A kind yet authoritative demeanor.

Baek Hanseong, the 27th President of South Korea, who set the record as the youngest to be elected at the age of 40, spoke in a gentle tone.

""As you may know from the official announcement from the Blue House yesterday, the recent series of Byunyi Gates...""

His calm and composed demeanor naturally instilled trust in people.

His compelling voice, interspersed with subtle humor, was one of President Baek Hanseong's strengths. It was no wonder people were captivated.

When his speech, reminiscent of his campaign declaration, ended, a round of applause erupted from the reporters.

""It's like a campaign rally.""

Seok Gojun muttered, his voice a mix of anger and sarcasm.

""How many of those guys in there do you think didn't take our money, huh?""

""When the Master was around, they couldn't even breathe properly. The youngest president in history? Anti-Ares Guild? Even that bastard Baek Hanseong was under the Master's thumb.""",1,1752517931.0,u_Dry_Code_7119,0,1.0,False

The absence of a glass carafe adds a unique twist to its design, making it less susceptible to accidental breakage. Trust me, with clumsy hands like mine, that’s a huge plus.

**Operation and Convenience**  
Using the machine is straightforward, even for someone like me who hasn’t fully mastered much in the kitchen. The programmable timer allowed me to set my brew up to 24 hours in advance—wake-up coffee has never been more convenient. With four brew strength options, I found myself experimenting between bold on groggy mornings and iced coffee during hot afternoons. Dispensing coffee is as easy as gently pressing the dispensing bar, which has added an element of fun to my routine.

**Brewing Performance**  
The internal warming heater was a feature I didn’t realize I needed until I used it. Unlike traditional hot plates, which scorch coffee over time, this system kept my coffee tasting fresh for hours. I can confidently return to a warm cup even an hour later without that burnt aftertaste I always dreaded with other coffee makers. Brewing small batches for just myself didn’t feel inefficient either, as the 1–4 cup setting handled it perfectly.

**Good Aspects**  
Every coffee morning has been a test of its strengths, and the results are convincing:  
- Fresh, great-tasting coffee for up to four hours without scorched flavor.  
- A robust variety of brewing options, including regular, bold, small-batch, and iced.  
- A mess-free dispensing system—no more fragile carafes or hard-to-clean stains.  
 
**Areas of Concern**  
Of course, no product is flawless, and this coffee maker had a few minor hiccups:  
- The internal tank can take a bit of effort to clean, especially for someone impatient like me.  
- Although the lack of a carafe is convenient, it also makes it harder to gauge how much coffee is left without opening the machine.  
- Some users might find the machine’s body to feel less premium due to its light plastic components.

**Competing Options**  
In terms of market rivals, I’ve owned a Keurig machine that came with similar programmable features but lacked the brew strength customization this offers. On the other hand, traditional drip coffee makers like Mr. Coffee may boast simplicity, but they don’t offer a no-carafe design or a fresh-flavor promise. The Hamilton Beach machine balances convenience and functionality better than most models I’ve tried.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the features packed into this coffee maker, I’d say its value aligns well with similar products in its class. Investing in a machine that keeps coffee fresh, eliminates scorched flavors, and doesn’t require constant babysitting feels like smart spending for any coffee enthusiast. Its compact design and efficient functionality make the price point worthwhile without tipping into luxury territory.

1lzuanh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lzuanh/mils_ultimate_power_move_on_my_wedding_day/,MIL's ultimate power move on my wedding day,"Hello all, I've been a fan on YouTube for a while but I am new to Reddit. My wedding was 5 years ago this summer, and the traumatic story has since become a sort of weird anecdote my husband and I share with people and laugh.

My (40f) husband (46m) and I got married in the summer of 2020, which is in and of itself sort of a disaster. We put down a deposit on a date in early August and it fell just outside the automatic refund/reschedule option for our venue. This was a second wedding for each of us, and the decision to get married at a one stop venue was a compromise. My first wedding was an elaborate event that my ex and I created from the ground up, we organized and planned everything ourselves and it was exhausting, my husband's first wedding was a beach elopement in his dress uniform. So it was really important to him to have a real wedding with friends and family, and it was important to me to have most of it off my plate.

We didn't have a huge guest list, and some people chose not to attend because of Covid. The venue was great about precautions with masks, cleaning, and the ceremony was outside. Neither me or my husband have siblings, his dad had passed away the year before and mine was out of the picture. My daughter and his daughter were both in the wedding, and a few relatives and chosen family attended. Even the wedding officiant was a friend of ours. His mom was the only person who traveled to attend. We live in Colorado, and she was in California and though we had several phone conversations over the years and sent pictures, we had not previously met in person.

She flew in 2 days before, in time to attend the rehearsal and the wedding. When we picked her up from the airport, she was brought out in a wheel chair, with a plastic face shield over her N40. She could walk, but she had some vertigo problems, and the airline was being cautious as she had registered disability accommodations. She seemed lovely but tired that evening and we took her to the hotel room she had across the street from the venue.

The next day, we did the rehearsal and had lunch; she spent some quality time with her granddaughter, and things seemed fine. That evening, my husband and I went our separate ways, we lived together already, but he spent the night with his best man, and I spent it with the bridal party. Our wedding was Saturday, and we had the venue for five hours between 10 am and 3 pm, so the bridal party and I got up early, picked up the flowers and a few other things and went to the venue to get ready in the bridal suite.

My husband and the best man had a couple of stops that morning as well, including picking his daughter up from her mom and picking up his mom.

I was normal wedding day nervous, getting ready, hair and make-up. We had a budget event, so me and the bridesmaids all made ourselves up without a make-up artist or hair stylist. My mother made desserts for us, baklava and mini cannoli. We had just a small cake for husband and I to cut. My mom was in and out of the bridal suite, my daughter was a bridesmaid, and my stepdaughter was our flower girl. We had paid for an open bar to a certain limit, and then the plan was to switch to a cash bar.

I was ready.
It was time.

The venue planner came in and told me we were delayed. We were waiting on the best man. That's all the information I got. I knew where he was; he was across the street, picking up my mother in law. We waited. I was singing out anxiety, and people were milling around, and I was practicing breathing, and my bridesmaids were practicing, keeping me calm. And we waited. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. 20 minutes. Forty minutes past go time, I dispatched the bridesmaids to the groom's suite to get more information.

The venue opened the bar for guests and comped it.

They came back after a bit and told me that MIL had a medical emergency and the best man was delayed waiting on an ambulance, but he would be along shortly. Twenty minutes later, and an hour after the wedding was supposed to start, I walked down the aisle with my best friend to give me away. Husband and I had planned to have our mom's walk down first and do a little candle thing, but since his mother was indisposed my mother walked with the wife of a groomsmen.

My husband was red-faced and teary when I walked to him. He cries at movies, so I wasn't shocked. He'd definitely had some whiskey while we waited, but that was a perk of the venue, and he's a big guy, and he was in the Navy. We forgot to exchange rings at the altar, and the live feed to our guests who couldn't attend due to covid had some confusion about it. At the reception which was shortened because of the delay I went to each table and thanked them for coming, and patience with the delay and that MIL was being cared for and we had hopes she would make a full recovery. Husband also went around to each table a little behind to convey his sentiments in person.

Husband had had more than a whiskey or two. Our first dance was everything I hoped it wouldn't be. He kept dipping me. He has a spinal injury, i have scoliosis- I had made it clear that dipping was off the table, but he was very emotional and dreamy and a whiskey. There were some speeches, and my maid of honor gave a particularly emotional and meandering speech. And everyone was so emotional. 

Even my mother, who was generally about as emotive as an alley cat, was a little glassy eyed and sniffling (cast my mother as a cross between Fran Drescher and Izma).

One of the groomsmen drove us to a hotel room for the evening. When we got to the bridal suite, my husband told me what his mother had actually done to delay our wedding.

She died.

Best man and husband were running a bit behind schedule on the way to the venue, and so best man dropped husband off to get ready then went to get MIL from the hotel. It was across a busy road, and there was a cluster of hotels together, creating a long bank of parking lots that would be too long a distance for MIL to walk. Best man knocked several times with no answer. He called with no answer. He called husband for an idea of what to do, and husband had the hotel open the room for best man.

The combination of persistent balance issues, an unfamiliar setting, and maybe a little altitude sickness (drink your water when you visit high altitude) had resulted in a fall. She hit her head on the coffee table and had an aneurism in the night. Best man was delayed waiting for the county coroner because she had been an out of state person who died by misadventure in a hotel room. My husband knew, the whole groom's party knew, and they were bringing him drinks as he coped. The venue planners knew and asked what to do, and he decided that we were getting married that day, and no one could tell me about the delay. I should have suspected when they comped an open bar.

The bridesmaids found out when I sent them to ask about the delay. My daughter told my mother, who promptly knocked a flute of champagne into a tray of baklava, and nearly collapsed under the weight of the drama. Everyone, to a soul, was forbidden to tell me what had happened. At one point my mother almost gave it away, in the bridal suite, when I asked if was bad luck for your mother in law to die on your wedding day, after I had been told about the medical emergency. She looked at me wide-eyed and said-

""They told you?""
And I said, ""What, no. Did they tell YOU?"" And she covered it up.

I went around to every table at the reception, and right behind me my Husband went to each table (because half our guests were read in to what had happened) to tell them to keep it quiet for the time being. He went through the whole wedding, he stood and did the vows, danced, and kept it all secret until the evening.

Afterward, my friends and family, my bridesmaids, my daughter, and my mother all apologized for the lying, but they all thought it was his decision to get married that day. I think my mother put it best when she said of his decision, ""Don't be frustrated about it. He saved you. He saved you from having to make a lose-lose choice that would make you the bridezilla in either event. You would have either had to decide to cancel and reschedule everything, or you would have had to be the one who decided to get married the day your mother in law died.""

Five years on, it's this dark comedy that lives in my head. A stage play or a movie script waiting to be written. But if husband and I ever renew our vows, we're eloping to a beach. My advice for anyone sweating marriage drama is to laugh off the small stuff; it's (probably) not life or death.",48,1752517623.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,0.98,False

Article Text: 

Starbucks is requiring its corporate workers to come in the office a minimum of four days a week, up from three, as the coffee chain pushes ahead on its turnaround plan.

The four-day requirement will begin in the new fiscal year, which starts in October, Chief Executive Brian Niccol said Monday.

In addition to the new in-office requirement, leaders and people managers from Starbucks’s Support Center who are working remotely will have to relocate to Seattle or Toronto within 12 months. In February, Starbucks asked its vice presidents who were working remotely to relocate to the two cities.

Starbucks is offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment for employees who don’t want to comply with the new requirements.

The move is part of Niccol’s cost-saving turnaround plan called Back to Starbucks. In February, the company laid off 1,100 corporate workers.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,” Niccol said. “But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

Niccol has a stipulation in his signing bonus with the coffee giant allowing him to live in Southern California and commute to Starbucks’s headquarters on a corporate jet. Starbucks said Monday that Niccol has an office and residence in Seattle.

Starbucks’s new requirement follows other corporations that have limited hybrid-work options this year.

Some have received immediate backlash.

JPMorgan shut down comments on an internal webpage after the bank’s return-to-office policy, implemented in March, stirred criticism and suggestions of unionization among employees. Amazon’s corporate employees returned to the office full time in January, but the e-commerce retailer didn’t have enough desks and parking for them.",16,1752517620.0,starbucks,11,1.0,False

This is coming from someone who kissed a lot of toads to find this prince, so I know what bad partners were like, but before him, I never knew what a good partner was like.

I'm not trying to brag, but after 10 years, my husband still treats me like a valued human being, and I'm continually amazed.

He brings me coffee in bed in the mornings, every morning. He makes sure I always have flowers in the house. He listens to me, and offers good advice and practical solutions to problems.

He kisses and hugs me every day. He helps do the dishes, other household chores, and helps clean the litter box. He remembers little things I say I like, and gets them for me for holidays/my birthday. Just tiny things, like he knows I love crows, so he got me a stuffed animal crow one year. We're not well off, but those small gestures mean a lot.

When we have a disagreement, he doesn't just fight with me, he listens and we try to come to some sort of understanding together. He rarely yells, but if he does, it's into the ether and not at me. :)

He's so good with our cat children, plays with them, pets them, and brings them to the vet with me.

He always has my back when my in-laws get a little mean.

He tells me when I'm mistaken, which I appreciate, so I don't spread incorrect information. When he's wrong, he actually admits it!

He plays video games responsibly, a couple of hours a night, which is great because I get to watch my shows or read while he does them. If I knock on his door while he's playing (which I try not to do often), he takes his headphones off and asks what I need, and is never grumpy about it.

He lets me play D&D with him and never gets upset if I forget my powers or other important information.

We're both human, and we've had our problems, but compared to anyone I've ever dated, he's the kindest, most loving, and giving person I've ever met, and I just had to say so in detail after 10 lovely years. All I can do is try my best to treat him just as kindly and lovingly as he treats me.

I guess I just wanted to say, don't settle for someone who doesn't treat you kindly. It's so worth it to wait for a good one.

But Is India Even Bothering?","We all rely on GPS for *everything* – from flying planes to finding the nearest coffee shop. But what if that system was fundamentally broken, easily jammed, or even *spoofed* to send you thousands of miles off course?

This isn't sci-fi anymore. Aircraft are reportedly losing GPS signals constantly, sometimes ending up drastically off track. There are documented ""dead zones"" globally where GPS is unreliable or unusable, pointing to deliberate interference. [Check live documented dead zone here.](https://gpsjam.org/?lat=37.92326&lon=64.80363&z=2.0&date=2025-07-02)

Our current backup systems (called IMUs) are old tech that just drift off course over time, useless for long journeys.

But there's a revolutionary, *unhackable* solution being developed: **Quantum Positioning System (QPS)**, using bizarre states of matter colder than deep space.

While cutting-edge labs elsewhere are putting this incredible technology into the air *right now* to build our unhackable future, it begs a serious question:

**Where does India stand on this critical, next-gen tech? Are our universities and research institutions even remotely close to developing** ***practical, flight-tested*** **quantum navigation, or are we simply lagging behind in the global race for resilient infrastructure?**

Here's what this article reveals about this insane tech and the potential global tech gap:

* **GPS is Under Attack, CONSTANTLY:** Incidents of aircraft losing signals or being sent miles off course are real and increasing. \~900 flights per day globally faced suspected spoofing/jamming as of 2024.
* **Documented ""Dead Zones"":** Analysis shows specific areas of high GPS interference, with probable sources localized near places like St. Petersburg, Russia, and west of San Antonio, USA.
* **Current Backups Fail:** Traditional Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) rely on old physics principles and suffer from inherent drift, making them inaccurate for long durations without GPS updates.

* **Quantum Leap:** Quantum Navigation uses matter at the *absolute edge of physics* – like Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), atoms cooled to billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

https://preview.redd.it/x819p8lftvcf1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=f10a7cfa2518ae42044a36458631dff31624d51c

* **Doing the IMPOSSIBLE:** Scientists have successfully created and *manipulated* these incredibly delicate quantum states *on a moving aircraft* during flight tests. This is pushing physics out of the lab into the real world.
* **Unhackable by Design:** Unlike GPS which relies on vulnerable external signals, QPS works by precisely measuring motion using the fundamental properties of matter *within the device*. It's inherently immune to jamming and spoofing.
* **Atom Interferometry:** This tech uses the wave nature of ultra-cold atoms, splitting and recombining them to measure tiny accelerations and rotations with extreme precision – far beyond current sensors. 
* **Future is Miniaturized & Resilient:** The goal is to shrink this tech down using integrated photonics, creating palm-sized, highly rugged, unjammable navigation systems desperately needed in a world where GPS is becoming a liability.

The vulnerability of GPS is a massive threat to aviation, logistics, defense, and daily life. Quantum Navigation offers a path to a resilient, unhackable future. But are *we* (India) actively building this future, or just watching others fly by with quantum labs?

What are your thoughts on this? Are you aware of Indian universities or labs doing significant work on practical, flight-ready quantum navigation systems?

I am lost. I need someone to talk to. Can’t rely on the few friends I have because they know my wife. I don’t know what to do and I feel as if I’m doing something wrong. No matter how hard I try to apologize or make up for what ever my wife says I did it doesn’t get me anywhere. I don’t want to lose her but I have put in so much into our marriage and living that I have nothing left. I have literally changed the way I react when we have our misunderstandings, I don’t show any anger at all. I always am considerate of what I’m saying to her. Even when I try to have a civilized conversation about my thoughts or reasons I did something she gets irritated and says I’m getting defensive. How do I not get defensive when she says that something I did makes her sad or my reply makes her think I’m upset. 

Her text to me after an evening of her being sad and crying. I finally got her to talk some and she said she wanted some intimacy and closeness last week. I was out of town and when I got home we both were exhausted. After several days of running errands and work, etc. we were in bed and she started crying just before we usually go to sleep. We had been just talking like we normally do about everyday things, then she started showing she was upset and then stated she was missing me being intimate. She also acknowledged that we have been busy and no time. 

After a few days of trying to explain to her that I want to make her happy and I will give her intimacy while holding her hand and laying my head on her arm as I also tell her I love her so much and I’m sorry. Sh said she didn’t want to talk but I told her to please talk if she felt like it. I never want to go to sleep and she need to talk, because in the past she stays up and cry’s even harder if we haven’t talked. I think she keeps rehashing it in her head and it causes it to get exaggerated. Makes is seem 10 times worse than it really is. 
She opened up and stated all that she felt and I told her I make mistakes and am sorry. I try to give her everything she wants and I am very intentional to make sure that I communicate with her and that I am trying to understand why she’s upset. During that time, she came back and was telling me that I was wrong. I asked her to give me just a minute and let me explain without her interrupting. She is always big on wanting me to listen to her and I did but then when I got ready to reply back or try to explain to her anything or my feelings, I ask her to let me speak and she give me a minute to do so. She stopped talking and she started frowning. I started telling her that I’m sorry that I wasn’t intimate with her when she needed it yet and I intend on being intimate with her, but we’ve been busy and time has gotten away from us. I told her I loved her and she didn’t wanna talk after that and basically said that she was going to sleep. So I stayed up for about another hour. Trying to figure out what I did wrong. The next morning she didn’t speak to me or anything . This morning we said our good mornings I kissed her on the forehead and made her morning coffee like I always do and told her I hope she had a great day. She acted real cold and didn’t have much of anything to say. This is her first text to me this morning . I promise I am not mad, I don’t get mad anymore. I control my feelings because back when we got together, we would discuss things and she would show that she was upset, but I clearly did not understand why. Then I would get frustrated because no matter what she said or did I just still didn’t understand why she got upset or was irritated with me because my intentions are always to be good to her, to be genuine and to be selfless. I told her if I am anything, but that it is me accident. I told her that I love her unconditionally and I wouldn’t ever hold anything against her and that I would hope that she would do the same for me. It seems now that anything that happens she tends to draw up and hold it against me. if me and her have a miscommunication at all, I can literally spend some time by myself for an hour, maybe lay down and take a nap and wake up and I have no problems with anything anymore. She is the opposite of that. She needs to discuss it. Talk about it iron it out mentally and even feel secure with it. even the smallest of things she needs to diagnose everything. Stuff that doesn’t even matter or shouldn’t matter like she asked me something silly and I give her a goofy look and she said that why are you looking at me like you’re mad. I look back at her confused and go. I was not mad. I was just merely confused and she said that’s not. I’m confused look that’s a mad look. So she’s merely accusing me of acting or being something that I’m not. That is what hurts me the most. Here is her first text to me this morning. 

My wife:
You are being unreasonable because YOU are mad. I never said anything about being mad at you. I was trying to explain how I understood why you reacted the way you did last night and I was trying to explain that I am learning new things too just like you made a point of last night. 
There was nothing wrong with me asking why you are taking it upon yourself to feed Bo. I am seeking understanding. 
Be assured that this won’t be a problem in the future. I know better now and so I will keep my mouth shut and my head down. 
You have won. No worries. No pushback. 

Me:
I understood what you were talking about lastnight. I just started feeling sad because it seems that I’m not there for you when you need me most. I am sorry for that. I swear I try and again I never want you to feel like I don’t care about you or your needs. Today I started feeling like no matter what I do it’s just not enough. As a man, I give you everything I know to and struggle sometimes figuring it out even when you ask for something directly. My mind depending on my mood, I can listen, understand and give you everything you need and want but other times I get brain fog and it seems unclear or I feel depressed that I can’t give you what you need. Today I wasn’t ever mad at you, more so just feeling down that it seems I forget your needs and or don’t understand them when it’s most important. I feel like a failure and that’s all that I’m having a hard time with. I have changed (for the better because my love for you is real and strong) that’s what people /married couples do to show their true love. I know I have plenty more to give you and lots more understanding, love, compassion but every once in a while if I get brain fog I tend to get overwhelmed with my thoughts, stress and lack of self esteem. That is what happened to me yesterday. Since we have been doing other things today away from each other it has given me time to prioritize my thoughts and be able to explain my actions as well as mood. I am not mad, was never mad, just feeling down because I feel I can’t meet your needs as a husband emotionally. I will always try but sometimes I just feel I won’t ever succeed. That where my sadness and frustration is coming from. Example: if you try to make a cake, you are told how to make it and just get almost there every time but it just never tastes as good as you think it should, or your told you still are falling short. That’s me every once in a while.  My mood sometimes takes my patience and smiles and crushes them. 
I am merely trying to explain why I seemed distant this morning. It was my mood and had nothing to do with you. Im sorry and I love you so much!

My wife:
I was clear about how you did not let me down, I merely had a need. I don’t get depressed because you have needs. I was trying to be more open and honest with you, no walls, no shutting down. But it backfired on me and it has truly hurt me now. 
I have learned my lesson. 
I will not let my guard down again. You won’t have to worry about meeting my needs…there won’t be any. 
It was never about you doing something wrong. You made it about YOU, when it was never about you. 

Me:
I love you very very much. I want you to know that throughout our marriage we are going to have ups and downs. I know the downs are sometimes more disappointing than others but the important thing is to know that I’m not the kind of guy that if I drop the ball, I’m gonna continue walking and looking ahead. I’m gonna stop pick that ball up and circle back around. The important thing that I want you to know is that I realize yesterday I made it about me and that is probably what irritated you most. Before that you were just hurt and not mad but just hurt because you really needed me and that intimate bonding time. Me dropping the ball doesn’t mean that I do not care for you, doesn’t mean that I have forgotten you. It barely means that either be being tired or possibly even us not having time. As a human, we’re not perfect and they’re gonna be more days like that. Just like there’s days that you don’t feel good in you don’t have the energy or you’re feeling under the weather or we just don’t have time. What I’m saying in a nutshell is that please don’t hold it against me when I don’t always immediately respond to your needs. I promise it’s not that I don’t care. I will always come back to you and make sure you have it and I hope that you don’t feel that if I wasn’t able to give it to you the specific day or evening that you needed it that I can’t still give it to you. I love you so much honey and you mean the world to me. I just hope that when we have our downs that you don’t hold this against me something else because I have felt the cold shoulder from you since this first started night before last. This text is 100% about me, circling back around to you and giving you what you needed and being intentional on you knowing it. I can go into reasons and excuses, but then that would make me seem like I’m defending myself and I’m not defending myself right now. I am reaching out to you and just wanting you to know to please give me a chance to circle back around without holding anything against me. When you say that you won’t let your guard down anymore, it makes me feel as if you’re telling me that you will remember this and you won’t ask me or expect me to give you the intimacy that you need. We are married and I will always give you what you need but sometimes I’m a little slow so give me a chance to circle back around and make up for that without giving up on me please. My love for you will never change. You are and will always be my 👸

My wife:
In response to your text…
You still don’t get it. On Saturday night you asked me what I was thinking. I guess I seemed distant and you picked up on that. When I told you how I was feeling it was capital ONLY about how I was feeling. It was not about you not doing something!!! I wasn’t saying that you dropped the ball. I wasn’t saying that I was holding something against you. I was not saying ANYTHING about you. I explained that I had been feeling down and needed connection and didn’t get it. Translation: I was still feeling down from a few days before. I wasn’t saying that you were the reason I felt down. I was saying that the need I had was never resolved, so I still felt down. I have been very clear with you about feeling disconnected and that I needed focused time to reconnect. And then you turn around and made it about you as if I had complained to you that you didn’t do something. I was only answering your question and being open and honest. And the way I got paid back for it was a whole bunch of shit from you. And now I’m mad because You don’t listen to me. All you had to do was immediately say “oh wow, you’re right. Can I help you now?” Because the only problem was that I needed emotional connection and instead of doing it, you went off on a tangent. You made me feel worse by your lecture that you tried to say was not a lecture, but was 100% a defensive, deflective lecture. 
I guess you don’t understand emotional connection. When life gets busy and we’re working a lot and there’s lots of things to take care of or stress about and we’re tired a lot, I feel disconnected. It isn’t your fault that it happens. But I can’t feel connected unless there is someone to connect WITH and people have to make intentional time for it. If not, life takes over and that closeness gets stolen. It happens to everyone, but maybe no one else really cares. I have had to learn to live without out it for my whole life before you, and I can learn to again.

Me:
Honey, I hear you. I understand that what I said hurt you and made you feel like opening up was a mistake. That breaks my heart, because I never want you to feel that way with me. Your needs will always matter to me. You don’t need to guard your heart—I love you for who you are and everything you feel. I didn’t mean to make you feel unsafe, and I’m so sorry I did. I’m here. I want to learn how to love you better, not push you away.

My wife:   (No answer as of yet)

——————-
I feel I can not get out of this miscommunication cycle when we get here. I badly want to talk to a counselor but when we were going on our second year of marriage we were seeing a Christian counselor. He was great and gave us useful tools and information. We have been doing well but it keeps coming back it seems like. She has a bunch of communication issues from her past 27 year marriage with a man who neglected to talk to her, hold her or even treat her a tenth of how I am. He past away from health related issues and she still harbors some of those thought processes that he put her through. There could be something I do or say that triggers her to feeling like she did something wrong but I immediately tell her that she didn’t do anything wrong to not feel bad. But where I was going with that was that she literally lied to the counselor a few times when he directly asked her why she acted the way she did towards me and she said that I yelled at her. that made me so mad and felt so bad that she lied in front of me like that to him. Instead of defending myself and making it look like I was a child. I did not defend myself and acted my age. I’m afraid that if we get to another counselor, she’s going to lie again, and I cannot stand for someone to lie. I have caught her in a few lies in the past when she is talking back to me about something and and she will say, you did this. My reply would be no I did not, and she would blatantly say I was a liar, and that I outright did something like yelling or something like that. I could literally be monotone in my voice and she think that I’m yelling. So I can’t even hardly talk to her now without her thinking that my tone is wrong or my look is wrong. I’m just torn and don’t know what else to do. If you made it through all of this Reed then thank you for giving me your time. Any comments or replies would be grateful or just some prayers. I love my wife.

The pros - we've managed to curb SOME of her biting, she does really great with sleeping and napping in her crate, and she is 95% potty trained. 

The negatives - this girl can be FERAL. LOL! She is SO bitey/mouthy that it can be hard to even play with her. She has a few wake windows a day where her energy is just off the charts and all the tricks in the book aren't enough. We literally take her on 3-4 short walks per day because we run out of ideas. I have two massive baskets filled with every chew stick you can think of - bully sticks, collagen twists, peanut butter sticks, chicken jerky, pupsicles, etc. But I can't give her four of these things a day and they only hold her attention for short periods of time. I have things like lick mats and freezable kongs, etc, but again, they only last for so long. And she is wicked smart.....she knows she isn't supposed to chew on our wood furniture. She will start to bite it, then when we say 'no', she stops and then just stares at us looking for a treat and when we don't give her one (because we know what she is doing) she barks at us. LOL. I have a huge basket of various chew bones to redirect her with on our coffee table because that is her furniture chew toy of choice, and it just does nothing. 

  
I'm just getting really discouraged that we seem to be doing all the right things and we are just exhausted. It's hard to enjoy her when we feel like we are constantly having to 'manage' her, redirect her, etc. And we can't even lean on our kids because while they adore her and want to play with her, they are all cautious to play with her because of how bitey she is.
