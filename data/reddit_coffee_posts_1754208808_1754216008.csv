Someone to have private jokes with and other things that are ours and ours alone. 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel and especially roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don‚Äôt smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt.

Over the last 2 years I have gone on probably 20+ hinge dates and have met ZERO people in person. I have accepted this is not how I want to find a partner, and I am not finding quality partners. It's time to leave the house, its time to be social again. It's hard for me because I don't drink or smoke weed so I would really prefer not to do night life because I don't really want to date someone who likes to go to bars. I don't have a problem being with someone who drinks but hanging out at bars and clubs every weekend just isn't my speed. I like reading, and sitting at the park or on my porch and walking, skateboarding, film photography, and being creative and making things with my hands. I am in school for comp sci and want to master in library sciences when I'm done. So I don't know! I think a big reason I have chosen this is I stopped drinking the first of the year and stopped smoking weed too. It's my first full year with no social media. I feel so happy and confident and anxiety free for the first time in years  Maybe I will go to the bookstore more or study at a coffee shop, or just go to the park more.

----------------------------------------

I (39F) have been married to my husband (39M) for 11 years, and we were together for 3 years before that. He‚Äôs the second of seven ‚Äî one older sister, four younger sisters, and the youngest, a brother (M28), who‚Äôs getting married soon.

Due to family issues, two of my SILs are no longer in the picture. So now there‚Äôs Emma, Rita, and Lisa ‚Äî the younger three.

In my country, it‚Äôs pretty normal to have two wedding receptions ‚Äî one on the bride‚Äôs side and one on the groom‚Äôs ‚Äî especially if they‚Äôre from different states. It helps relatives who can‚Äôt travel attend at least one. So for our own wedding, I wore a white dress for the solemnization, emerald green for my reception, and a royal blue gown with a gold veil for the groom‚Äôs side.

That royal blue gown is the star of today‚Äôs drama.

Back in May 2025, I decided to breathe new life into it. It had been sitting in the closet for 11 years, collecting dust and memories. I wanted to repurpose it into something wearable for formal events. A fitted top with lace from the veil paired with Thailand hand-woven silk. 

Fast forward to now ‚Äî my BIL‚Äôs wedding is coming up. Unlike the traditional two-reception format, there‚Äôs only going to be one. Totally normal these days with budget cuts, so no one batted an eye.

Then one day, BIL casually drops in the family group chat, ‚ÄúOh, the groom‚Äôs family can wear any shade of blue.‚Äù

Music to my ears. No need to spend on a new outfit. My altered dress fits the brief. 

My PIL, SILs, and even my husband were on board. My husband said, ‚ÄúAs long as it‚Äôs appropriate, wear whatever you want.‚Äù

Still, I hesitated. That shade of blue? It‚Äôs bold. What if it outshines the bride? She‚Äôs wearing a traditional cream outfit. 

Let‚Äôs rewind for context.

My BIL met his fianc√©e in August 2023. She‚Äôs also 39 ‚Äî a single mom with a 14-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son. I had just given birth to my second child in October that same year when she sent a lovely baby gift ‚Äî a sleeping suit. I thought, ‚ÄúHow sweet!‚Äù

When we finally met for the first time in April 2024, I greeted her warmly. I know how intimidating it can be to marry into this family ‚Äî my FIL has ten siblings, and while everyone‚Äôs friendly, there‚Äôs still this unspoken protocol. It‚Äôs a lot. I tried my best to make her feel welcome.

The second time we met was during my SIL Emma‚Äôs engagement in June 2024. I was in a room putting my toddler to sleep when she came in and made small talk. She asked about my son‚Äôs school since her kids would be transferring after the wedding. Coincidentally, her 10-year-old son is the same age as mine.

I answered casually, telling her about a private school near my house. Then she replied, ‚ÄúOhhh‚Ä¶ that school? There‚Äôs tons of them back in [her state].‚Äù The tone? Ouch.

There are only three branches of that school ‚Äî all in my state. Did I sound boastful talking about my son's school? Maybe. But really, there‚Äôs nothing fancy about it. It‚Äôs just the most affordable private option nearby ‚Äî yet it offers the same quality education. I wasn‚Äôt trying to impress. I was just answering her question.

I brushed it off, thinking maybe she misunderstood my tone. People from my region sometimes sound curt or blunt even when we don‚Äôt mean to ‚Äî and I‚Äôve spent years trying to soften that, especially with new people. But still‚Ä¶ it lingered.

Third meeting ‚Äî her engagement to BIL in August 2024. I congratulated her with a cheek-to-cheek air kiss (you know the type), and she responded with this whole ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶ who are you again?‚Äù energy. But warm and chirpy with everyone else. She even excitedly greeted my older SIL‚Äôs son, Gale, and encouraged her son to befriend him since they‚Äôre both into sports. My son, who was standing right next to Gale, was invisible to her.

Weird, but fine. Whatever. I let it go.

Then came my SIL Emma‚Äôs wedding reception in July 2025.

After the ceremony, once the guests cleared and it was just close relatives ‚Äî cousins, aunts, uncles ‚Äî catching up, I sat and chatted like usual.  I know how to navigate cousin gossip circles. I don‚Äôt always talk much, but I laugh, I listen, I belong.

She walked over and introduced herself to the cousins ‚Äî it was her first time meeting them.

I don‚Äôt know how it happened, but somehow she started saying, ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I fluently speak Mandarin, okay. I have a great job. Not some regular one.‚Äù

Then, like she was revealing a plot twist, she added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a divorc√©e. Two kids ‚Äî 14 and 10.‚Äù

The cousins looked at me like, What is this energy? I smiled and complimented her outfit to break the awkwardness.

But she wasn‚Äôt done.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to burden anyone. That‚Äôs why I keep working. Especially in this economy. Being a housewife sounds fun, but I‚Äôd feel bad for my husband if I stopped working. A woman needs to work so she can buy whatever she wants ‚Äî nice shoes, nice clothes, make-up.‚Äù

While looking. Directly. At me.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî she has plenty to be proud of. A good job, well-dressed kids, oozing confidence. And me? I‚Äôve got enough insecurities to match. I overthink how I speak, what I wear, how I carry myself. And when someone walks in, listing her accomplishments I shrink. 

I‚Äôm a full-time housewife.

My husband provides for everything ‚Äî skincare, vitamins, and yes, even my emotional support snacks. Neither he nor his family has ever made me feel lesser for not earning. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt wrestle with it. I used to have a career ‚Äî over 12 years as an entertainment journalist. I had my own paycheck, my own schedule, my own identity. Letting that go, even by choice, broke me a little.

After five years, I‚Äôve mostly made peace with it. But when a woman like BIL‚Äôs fianc√©e walks into the room ‚Äî beautiful, polished, outspoken ‚Äî those old feelings come roaring back.

I've always been easily intimidated by confident people. I tried to cut it off. But she shut me down.

That‚Äôs when my petty demon officially woke up‚Ä¶ and stretched.

She wasn‚Äôt done. She smiled sweetly and kept going:

‚ÄúMy daughter and son love skating. They join big tournaments. They even surf occasionally. That‚Äôs why I work so hard. Sports aren‚Äôt cheap. Does your son do any sports? Gale plays rugby ‚Äî international tournaments, you know.‚Äù

Girl. Please.

Why are you trying to compare? Don‚Äôt you already know my son‚Äôs not into sports? I‚Äôm sure BIL told you ‚Äî he‚Äôs always bragging about your kids and their extreme sports achievements.

Meanwhile, my son is a gentle, clingy preteen who still holds my hand in crowds. He likes archery, but he struggles with his eyesight ‚Äî so he gave up.

The cousins who heard her looked visibly uncomfortable. Later, they told my husband. He asked me why I didn‚Äôt clap back. I told him, ‚ÄúBecause the button hasn‚Äôt been pressed‚Ä¶ yet.‚Äù

My husband? He‚Äôs not the type to let anyone trash-talk me ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs family. If I‚Äôm wrong, he‚Äôll correct me ‚Äî but in private. Out in public, he has my back, always.

On the other hand, my PIL and  SILs already don‚Äôt like her. They‚Äôve all picked up on how controlling she seems ‚Äî and they‚Äôre not even married yet. The aunts and uncles? Also surprised. When she introduced herself to everyone, it felt like she was auditioning for a spot in the family ‚Äî trying hard to prove she belonged.

And ever since the engagement, my BIL has changed. He used to be spontaneous, fun, present. Now? He‚Äôs like her personal assistant. He reports everything to her ‚Äî what he eats, where he is, sends pictures like it‚Äôs proof of life. At Lisa‚Äôs engagement prep, the rest of us were running around getting things done. He was in a room, video-calling her for hours.

My MIL, SILs, and even my husband have all told him straight up: they don‚Äôt like her. Not out of pettiness ‚Äî but because they see through her act. But he‚Äôs chosen her over the family. Fine. They respect his choice ‚Äî but if he thinks they‚Äôre going to roll out the royal carpet and bow down to her, he‚Äôs dreaming. They will be polite. But that‚Äôs it.

The gossip flows when the siblings gather. I mostly sit and sip. That‚Äôs how I found out what really happened at Emma‚Äôs wedding. Apparently, when Emma walked down the aisle, their eyes met ‚Äî and the fianc√©e rolled her eyes. Why? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And it‚Äôs not just family noticing her red flags. My husband works in the same office as BIL. Even coworkers talk. One told him she once visited the office to use the restroom, saw a shirt design of an orangutan (for a wildlife org), and laughed: ‚ÄúIt looks like Emma.‚Äù

BIL said nothing. Just stood there.

Classy.

My husband and I didn‚Äôt tell Emma. She‚Äôd go nuclear if she knew. Even Rita and Lisa don‚Äôt know. We kept it quiet.

Another incident: Rita asked the fianc√©e about the reception ‚Äî like what the groom‚Äôs side could help with, such as packing goodie bags or becoming ushers. The fianc√©e‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúMY EVENT.‚Äù

Rita was stunned. Fuming, but couldn‚Äôt vent. So she told my husband, and he was livid ‚Äî ready to confront BIL.

I told him to calm down and just ask BIL. It‚Äôs better if we don‚Äôt get involved in the wedding prep. We can just come as guests and leave after we eat.

Later, my husband called a sibling meeting. That‚Äôs when BIL finally explained what the groom‚Äôs side was expected to do. That part is settled now.

There was also a time Lisa teased BIL, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why she fell in love with you.‚Äù

The fianc√©e responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not picky ‚Äî even if he‚Äôs so dull-witted.‚Äù

We froze. Let the siblings and his parents tease him ‚Äî but don‚Äôt talk like that in front of the family.

Part of me wonders if she‚Äôs just insecure. Maybe she sees how my MIL and SILs treat me ‚Äî feeding me when I‚Äôm too busy, making me coffee, helping with the kids. My MIL sometimes fusses over me more than her own son. Even my husband jokes, ‚ÄúAm I adopted?‚Äù Maybe the fianc√©e thought, she wants that too.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve been here for 11 years. I worked to earn their love and trust. Nothing was handed to me.

I don‚Äôt blame her for wanting to belong. But don‚Äôt shine by stepping on me.

The only demon awake now is my pettiness. I tried to leash it. To forget the things she said. But it still stings.

Just sharing ‚Äî recently, my son joined a p√©tanque tournament. His first ever. He trained for three months and placed third. He didn‚Äôt even know what p√©tanque was before!

If my petty side keeps growing, I swear I‚Äôll wear that repurposed royal blue gown and turn his trophy into a shoulder accessory. Like a petty little pauldron of passive-aggression.

If I‚Äôm feeling especially dramatic, I‚Äôll even pretend my toddler accidentally slipped the trophy into my handbag before the ceremony. Oops! ü§≠ü§£

So, tell me‚Ä¶

Am I the a**hole if I show up in that dress?

My wife and I have been married for 4 years, but we‚Äôve known each other for almost 10. The last few years, I‚Äôve been really struggling with how unbalanced our relationship feels, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore.

Right now, I feel like I‚Äôm responsible for everything around the house. I cook, clean, manage all the bills, do the yard work, garden, etc. I also make most of the money. On top of that, I make a point to arrange date nights and small things to keep the relationship fun and connected, but it feels like I‚Äôm the only one trying.

To add more context, my wife has ADHD and struggles with anxiety, which I know makes things harder for her when it comes to managing tasks, routines, and sometimes even emotional connection. I‚Äôve always tried to be patient and supportive with that, but I‚Äôm starting to feel overwhelmed and burnt out handling everything myself. I don‚Äôt resent her struggles, but I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt know how to balance supporting her while still getting my own needs met.

In the 4 years we have been married she‚Äôs only worked for two, and when she didn‚Äôt work I still did most of the house chores on top of everything else.

We‚Äôve been very low on intimacy for a while now, even though I try to be proactive about it. Every morning, I wake up early to make her coffee and pack her a lunch before she goes to work because I want to support her. But honestly, I‚Äôm starting to feel really unappreciated and taken for granted.

One of the hardest parts recently is that we‚Äôve always talked about wanting kids, but she‚Äôs now changed her mind and says she doesn‚Äôt want them anymore. We‚Äôve had serious talks about all of these things, but I still feel like I‚Äôm not getting anything back from her in the relationship, emotionally or otherwise.

I love her so much, but I‚Äôm exhausted and feeling pretty lost.

1mgfakd,https://i.redd.it/h1so7h020sgf1.png,Single shot with Anita (PL-042EMI),"Hi!

I‚Äôve owned this machine for 4 years now, but I still can‚Äôt seem to get a proper single-shot espresso out of it.

The water I use is 6¬∞ dH from a centralized ion exchanger, and I‚Äôve learned about temperature surfing. Since I‚Äôm aiming for a ‚Äúsimple Italian bar‚Äù style coffee, I‚Äôve found the Kanzi Aurelia (40R/60A) and their Amalfitana to work best.

The machine reaches 12 bar when using a blind filter. I typically put 9g into the portafilter, because using less (around 7g) just destroys the puck‚Äîthere would only be about 1‚ÄØmm of coffee on the outer edge of the filter. Using less also leads to a wet, sludgy mess you have to wash out afterward.

However, with 9g, the coffee puck is pushed up against the shower screen, and you can see the five water outlets pressing into the puck. I assume this causes channeling.

I bought the IMS competition filter for 57‚ÄØmm baskets, but it didn‚Äôt really make a difference.

As you can see, I‚Äôm aware of at least some of the mistakes I might be making, but I still haven‚Äôt found a way to fix this issue with this machine. I could try lowering the OPV to 9 bar and make some other adjustments, but honestly, I‚Äôm at the point of considering selling the machine and getting a 58‚ÄØmm model with a separate grinder, hoping that would solve the main issue.

So‚Äîmain question again:
Has anyone managed to pull a proper single espresso shot out of this machine?

# poultice Stain remover: 2025's Best Buying Guide

A Poultice stain remover is an absorbent material mixed with a solvent, forming a paste that draws out stains from porous surfaces like stone, tile, and concrete. This method is especially useful when dealing with deeply embedded stains that surface cleaners fail to remove. Poultices are commonly used on surfaces susceptible to staining from oil, grease, rust, and organic matter.

Choosing the right poultice stain remover can be challenging due to the variety of products on the market. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the best poultice stain removers available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision based on your specific needs.

[[Explore Top Rated poultice stain remover on Amazon.]](https://site.healthytargeting.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=poultice stain remover)

## Key Features Analysis

the performance of a poultice stain remover depends heavily on its features. Factors such as absorbency, solvent type, and ease of application play critical roles in the success of stain removal.

**Composition:** The composition of a poultice determines its ability to draw out stains. A high-quality poultice includes absorbent materials such as diatomaceous earth or clay combined with a compatible solvent. The solvent helps to dissolve the stain, while the absorbent material wicks it away from the surface.

The best poultices use finely ground materials to ensure even coverage and maximum absorption. The choice of solvent is also crucial, as different solvents are more effective on specific types of stains. For example, mineral spirits are suitable for oil-based stains, while hydrogen peroxide works well on organic stains.

**Absorbency Rate:** A high absorbency rate is essential for effectively lifting stains from porous materials. This feature determines how quickly and thoroughly the poultice can draw the stain out of the surface. Products with a higher absorbency rate typically require less dwell time to achieve the desired results.

The absorbency rate is often influenced by the particle size and porosity of the absorbent materials used in the poultice. Finer particles create a larger surface area, enhancing the overall absorbency capacity. Materials like sepiolite clay and activated charcoal are known for their extraordinary absorbency properties, which contribute to the effectiveness of the poultice.

**Application method:** The ease of application can significantly impact the user experience and the effectiveness of the stain removal process. Poultices that are easy to mix and apply ensure even coverage and reduce the likelihood of errors. Some products come pre-mixed, eliminating the need for manual readiness and ensuring consistency.

The consistency of the poultice is another critical factor. It should be thick enough to stay in place on vertical surfaces but spreadable enough to cover the stain evenly. Products that offer convenient application tools, such as spatulas or brushes, can further simplify the process and improve the final outcome.

**Drying Time:** The drying time required for a poultice to work effectively is a key consideration. A shorter drying time can save time and expedite the stain removal process. However, its essential to balance drying time with the need for thorough stain absorption.

Different poultices have varying drying times depending on their composition and environmental conditions. Some poultices may require as little as 24 hours to dry,while others may need up to 72 hours.The drying process allows the solvent to dissolve the stain and the absorbent material to draw it out of the surface.

**safety Considerations:** Safety is paramount when using any stain removal product. A high-quality poultice should be formulated with user safety in mind, minimizing the risk of skin irritation, respiratory issues, or damage to the treated surface. This can include low VOC compositions.

Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, and wear appropriate protective gear, such as gloves and masks, when applying the poultice. Choose products that are non-toxic and environmentally friendly whenever possible. Proper ventilation during application and drying is also crucial to minimize exposure to perhaps harmful fumes.

## Core Benefits

Using a poultice stain remover offers several benefits compared to customary cleaning methods, especially for porous surfaces and stubborn stains. These benefits include improved performance, enhanced convenience, and cost efficiency.

**Targeted Stain Removal:** Poultice stain removers excel at targeting deeply embedded stains that surface cleaners can't reach. By drawing the stain out of the material,they offer a more effective and thorough cleaning solution. For example, oil stains in natural stone can be nearly unfeasible to remove with standard cleaners, but a poultice can penetrate the pores and lift the oil to the surface.

The localized application of the poultice allows for precise stain removal without affecting the surrounding area. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with small or isolated stains. users often report a significant improvement in the appearance of treated surfaces,restoring their original beauty and preventing long-term damage.

**Protection of Delicate Surfaces:** Unlike harsh chemicals that can damage or discolor delicate surfaces, poultice stain removers offer a gentler approach. The controlled application and absorption process minimizes the risk of harm to the treated material. For instance, polished marble can easily be etched by acidic cleaners, whereas a neutral pH poultice can safely remove stains without causing any damage.

The use of appropriate solvents and absorbent materials ensures that the poultice is compatible with a wide range of surfaces, including natural stone, tile, concrete, and grout. This makes it a versatile solution for various stain removal tasks around the home or workplace.

**Long-Term surface Health:** By removing stains thoroughly and gently, poultice stain removers contribute to the long-term health and appearance of treated surfaces. Preventing stain buildup can also protect the surface from future damage and degradation. Regularly using a poultice on stone countertops helps prevent stains from penetrating deeply, making them easier to clean in the future.

Routine stain removal can also extend the lifespan of the surface,reducing the need for costly repairs or replacements. This proactive approach to surface maintenance can save time and money in the long run, while also preserving the aesthetic appeal of the treated areas.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about poultice stain removers helps ensure users understand how to use them effectively and safely.

**Can poultice stain removers be used on all types of stone?**
While most poultice stain removers are safe for use on many types of stone, it's crucial to check the product label for specific compatibility data. Some stones, such as soft limestones or certain types of marble, may be more susceptible to damage from certain solvents. Always test the poultice on an inconspicuous area first to ensure there are no adverse reactions.

**How long should a poultice be left on a stain?**
The recommended dwell time for a poultice varies depending on the severity of the stain and the product's instructions. Typically, a poultice should be left on the stain for 24 to 72 hours to allow sufficient time for the solvent to dissolve the stain and the absorbent material to draw it out. Ensure the poultice remains moist during this period, as a dry poultice will not be as effective.

**What should I do if the stain is still visible after using a poultice?**
If the stain is still visible after the first application of the poultice, repeat the process. Sometimes, stubborn stains require multiple applications to fully remove. Ensure that the previous poultice was wholly dry before removing it. If the stain persists after several attempts, consult a professional stone restoration specialist.

**Are poultice stain removers environmentally friendly?**
Some poultice stain removers are formulated with eco-friendly ingredients, while others contain chemicals that may be harmful to the environment. Look for products that are labeled as biodegradable, low VOC, or non-toxic. Proper disposal of used poultice materials is also essential to minimize environmental impact. Check local regulations for guidelines on disposing of chemical-containing waste.

1mgezse,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mgezse/18_m_and_18_female_broke_up/,18 m and 18 female broke up,"18m and 18f , so I met this girl when I joined college and I liked her , now keep in mind we both are Indians this information will maybe make sense later in the story later. So as I said I liked the girl and I asked her out and she rejected me as I asked her out too quick and didn't know much abt each other and ig had trauma from her past relationship and wasn't ready for anything . She later started liking me back and we were in this very toxic situationship for like 3 months until she broke up with me. All my friends said yk leave her but I still chose to stay with  her , maybe now looking back on it  , it's prolly coz she was my first love or whatever . She broke things up in the winter vacation so I had zero chances of meeting her. Also I was an asshole back then and so was her , we both had ego issues me primarily because I wanted a rs , and yk she wasn't ready to offer me the commitment yet gave me the attention and everything . So yea basically situationship and the main issue i had back then was there was this other guybwho knew her before me and he constantly flirted with her like down bad level of flirting and they haven't met they know each other through a friend . She rejected him all the times . I had an issue with this coz I was like why are u yk entertaining other options. When she broke up with me she gave me zero explaination what so ever . Maybe it was my ego i just didn't try to fix it . A few days later of no contact she broke it and was angry abt why I told my friends abt rhe breakup coz I had specifically told her don't tell anyone abt any issues we have.  But obviously after the situationship ended I couldn't care less and I told my friends . She continued calling me for a few days and I thought well if she goes from my life atleast by being friends with her I can be close to her.  Something clicked in me and I stopped taking her calls and she never called after I didn't respond . Coz i understood she liked my attention . Then yk days pass and I have kinda accepted there's nothing more between us  and that's it and college still hasn't reopened. Im sad but idk what to do and I haven't moved on. Then college re opened and yk she was sitting there with my friend so I went and became nice to her but she didn't respond so I thought I'll just act like I don't know her and whatever . 10 days passed she unfollowed me on insta and I blocked her. A few days later while i was with my friends she came and said yk let's be friends we can't be awkward and stuff and told me to follow her , I said no first , but she was persistent so I listened,  but I showed her I followed her and when I reached home I just blocked her. Ik I was being petty but I couldn't care less back then . All of this in January btw and she broke yp with me in december . She again comes the next day and tell why did u block me and I said no yk , it's nothing.  She actually got angry and I told I will follow her when I reach home but I didn't. The next day is the day I'm travelling to india for a small family related trip she comes to me and we start talking she ends up crying infromt of everyone abt stuff like u don't care abt me anymore u blocked me and stuff like that and is a highly emotional person. She cried her eyes out infront of everyone in college In a room where everyone usually sits. I consoled her and we like held hands and all . Then I had to leave to my home to go to the airport. I tried calling her she didn't pick my calls up and we talked the next day on call and she was still crying then . I return and I meet her first thing when im back in the country.  We go out on somewhat unofficial date and I told her listen I can't give u attention if we aren't commited , she said she's not ready and all that . In the middle of all this she says this is just temporary and that I'm gonna have to find someone new and she also.will . That hurt me a lot but I didn't know what to say. We keep meeting like this in uni and everything and then I start looking for options and a girl did propose to me but I rejected 
 But then she suddenly started showing me so much of interest and care and all , I understood what actually happened . Then we unofficially got into a rs I guess . We had our honeymoon phase everything was nice and she now cares a lot about me and loves me . We go on dates and enjoy and then uni ends for summer break and I'm kinda tensed coz ik somethings bad going to happen. The entire 4 months were gold like they were really good.  During this i checked her phone and the guy I didn't like apparently I saw rs memes which she sent back in jan when she was mad at me.  I confronted her and she said she tried liking him to get over me but couldn't. Again around Feb I asked abt him to her and she said I told him to stop disturbing me since we became serious which is true . So I didn't get mad , I mean what am I even supposed to get mad at . I just wondered if this guy has no self respect. So yeah as I was saying uni closes and we still manage to meet every day,  and there's this one girl I'm really close to and she always helped me with my rs issues . But my ex didn't like her coz this friend talked shit abt her to me which I agreed with and she saw this when she went through my phone. This girl and me started meeting evry day as she got a internship and at my office building we started meeting for coffee. Oh and btw she is in very healthy and commited rs and we often talk abt our partners and our friend group and everything . My ex got so mad at me back then for talking to her always and dropping her of one day. She got possessive but I didn't mind coz i was also just like that . She told me.to block her and I did , keep in mind she never did block that guy. Again I never asked her to coz ik blocking doesn't work and yk doesn't make someone change the way the feel about someone . 2 weeks pass things go good and she's leaving to india for vacation for 2 months . I was sad coz somewhere in the back of my mind I knew we were going to break up 
 But we had a very romantic date , the day she was leaving and even before leaving she was talking abt me in such a romantic way and abt how she loves every part of me . A WEEK kinda goes by and she's being increasingly dry and I still put in effort coz I didn't want things to go bad . Then she calls me randomly and says we can't be together her parents caught us and they are being angry towards her right now and it has been living hell for a week for her. I say ok and cut the call,  the entire call was less than 2 mins and she asked me if I was angry I responded with no and said ok take care bye and cut the call . This was like 16 days back or something and since then I have developed new hobbies and started working on myself and things are going okay . But for some reason even on the week we broke up she started liking reels abt relationship and the typa guy she wants after the break up, which pissed me of coz I was like how did she move on so quick . Im telling you guys she atleast liked  40 of those reels and it somehow always came on my feed. I restricted her account to get some peace , I overthinked a lot and was sad about it but what can I do . Idk somehow my feed suddenly got everything she started liking.  She's not even someone who likes this many reels . So From to Feb  July we had it good and then she just left. I realised sub consciously I still have hope something will happen when she returns and that that's the reason I'm not all that sad . The reason I gave u guys the entire story of how the situatuonship ended and everything was to show you guys about how she reacted . I never saw a future with her coz I knew this won't last and I even told my friends this back in the day . I wanted to spend all the remaining time with her and tbh it was really good . Two weeks have passed me and her have had zero contact and I haven't moved on . All this rs memes  stuff she liked hurt me . Now uni is going to re open next month and she will return then . My friends have found me someone new and I'm looking forward to going for that person . But deep down I want my person back . I have tried my maximum to keep myself busy. What are tips to like ig idk move on or get her back or go for someone idk. From this above paragraph u can tell we both are still very immature teenagers and everything . She did love me at some point but ig that's gone now. Back then when we broke up I thought she didn't want me but now that I look back in it . I realised she did want me back or something . But now there's no sign of anyjing from her side . Also ik all of this is toxic.  What are tips  or anything,  idk if I emphasised enough , I feel like I explained the bad more than the good,  the good was pretty good guys. What I didn't understand is how can someone care about me this much and the next week leave like nothing happened . There could be Typos I haven't corrected it.  My friends are like u prolly don't know what she's going through her family must be giving her living hell. I understand all that but yk I think my ex is just using that as an excuse , coz if someone wanted to stay they would.",1,1754213210.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It seems it‚Äôs not just coffee but anything that triggers the release of too much bile, also spicy foods.

I had a flare up this week and it was agony. I went out for dinner and can only guess it was the pepper in a steak sauce, the vinegar in chimmichuri or cinnamon in another dish. The next day was hell with burning after bowel movements.

I immediately went back to my low acid and low residue diet (oatmeal, eggs, chicken, rice, bananas) and saw an improvement in 2 days. This improvement happens consistently so it rules out an anal fissure or internal hemorrhoids. 

Does anyone else out there suffer from intense burning after eating the wrong food? Any tips for me who‚Äôs going through a rough time?

1mgeybq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgeybq,Relaunch (ai-free covers) and special price deal for the first book!,"Hi folks:

I'm very happy to re-present to you my first two books with **ai-free cover art!** When I first published them, I was new to the scene and had no money left for a real artist. But that never sat really well with me, so I shelled out some money to get the cover drawn by a real artist. (The wife's not happy with my spendings, but I think it is worth every buck!)

The new covers were done by Gengardraw (from Fiverr), the dragon watermark is based on something a friend from X did for me (Graf\_Icker, but back then, it was still called Twitter), and the cover layout was done by me in Gimp. (A big thank you to u/Kia_Leep for ideas and suggestions regarding the text; I picked up those suggestions and played a bit with it, and now I'm very happy with the results!)

The whole series is free on Kindle Unlimited, but the first book is right now also available in a time-limited dead for only $0.99‚Äîthat's practically a steal-deal.

If you haven't heard about my series, I'll give you a quick rundown: It's a grimdark System Apocalypse, with a mature MC (no teenage power fantasy) caught in a broken integration. Alaric Nachtmoor is untrained, but neck-deep in problems. And there isn't even good coffee!

But his new reality offers ways to power, and power always comes with a price. The line between man and monster seems incredibly thin right now, and the System is not the only one who watches.

**Dawn of the Eclipse** is a darkly witty, emotionally rich LitRPG series that blends **progression fantasy**, **system apocalypse**, and **philosophical depth**. Perfect for fans of *Cradle, He Who Fights with Monsters,* and *Defiance of the Fall,* this is a story about **power, identity,** and the **cost of rewriting your fate.**

1mgevlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/80sManiaWrestling/comments/1mgevlv/a_more_comprehensive_list_of_80s_mania_wrestling/,"A More Comprehensive List Of 80s Mania Wrestling Returns Characters A, B, & C","***‚ÄúbUt FeNnIC! THeRe‚Äôs AlReaDy a ComPreHenSive LIsT Of WrEstler!‚Äù*** Yes, I know there is. But I also have a really boring job with a good amount of downtime, a brain with an eclectic sense of what to store, a decent researching skill, deceptively good looks that can be sensed through a screen (because why else would you be reading the me-centric parts of these post when by now you should know this is a disclaimer message), and an interest for the 80s and 90s my Gen-X parents instilled. I kinda, sorta (after a decent amount of research) know a thing or two about wrestling and hipster pop culture. I will try to remain neutral to any actions, instances, and movements referenced in this list! So if you want to know more or find a new favorite wrestler after watching matches/movies (Here‚Äôs looking at you, Dirk Dungeon) read on!

**2-Zap**\- Based off the rapper and actor Tupac Shakur. Tupac was born in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem to extremely political parents. His childhood saw him move to Baltimore, and in his teen years he attended the Baltimore School of the Arts where he found a passion for poetry and rap. As his passion and talent grew he joined the group Digital Underground, later going solo in his debut album *2Pacalypse Now,* and formed the rap group Thug . Shakur's music often reflected his role as a black man in 1970s and 80 society, the struggle of oppression faced by all, and various other social issues of his time. Shakur was shot and killed in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 7th, 1996. *West Side!*

**Ace Arcadium**\- Ace Arcadium is not based on one specific wrestler, although he bears a passing resemblance to the fictional character ‚ÄúLuke Skywalker‚Äù due only to his blonde hair. The key to getting this is where Ace is from, Outtumawa, Iowa. Outtumawa is home to *Twin Galaxies* which is a video game & record database, thus Outtumawa was declared the ‚ÄúVideo Game Capital Of The World‚Äù in 1982 and held the first North American video game Olympics later that year. *Infinite one up indeed, Ace!*

**Ace Of Spades**\- The key again to getting this is where Ace of Spades is from, that being Atlantic City, New Jersey. (I knew this one, but I applied the logic to Arcadium) Atlantic City is often considered the east coast Las Vegas since its legalization of casino gambling in 1976. The Ace Of Spades (that being the playing card in a standard 52 card deck) is part of the infamous Dead Man‚Äôs hand, which consists of two eights (spades and clubs), two aces (spades and clubs), and the queen of clubs. And, of course, Ace Spades is most likely an homage to the 1980 Motorhead song ‚Äú*The Ace Of Spades*‚Äù. *Don‚Äôt forget the joker, baby!*

**Arizona Chance**\- The Indiana Jones films feature its titular star, Dr. Henry Walton ‚ÄúIndiana‚Äù Jones jr (Played by actor Harrison Ford). Indiana, in his youth, fought in the Mexican revolution and WW1 as both a soldier and spy. He later became a fortune hunter, then a teacher after losing his first wife in a plane crash, then became a professor at Marshall College. We find Arizona Chance stuck mostly in Indiana‚Äôs first seen adventure (although the second movie) in the Temple Of Doom, where Indiana must free the children of India and find three Sankara Stones, both stolen by the Thugge Cult. *He belongs in a museum!*

**Average Guy**\- Dusty Rhodes rejoined the WWF in 1989, after years as one of JCP/WCW top stars and former booker. Rhodes was introduced via a series of skits of him performing average, everyday jobs like a plumber and a pizza, the skit always ending with ‚ÄúHey, aren‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù then Dusty‚Äôs logo. Dusty debuted wearing a wrestling singlet with yellow polka-dots and shucking-n-jiving, which many considered a rib on the legend. Dusty had notable feuds during this period of his career with ‚ÄúThe Million Dollar Man‚Äù Ted DiBiase, ‚ÄúMacho King‚Äù Randy Savage, and was in the debut match of The Undertaker at Survivor Series 1990. At the Royal Rumble 1991, Dusty took part in a tag match teaming with his son Dustin Rhodes against DiBiasie and his manservant, Virgil (Who himself was named after Dusty, who‚Äôs real name was Virgil Runnels). Dusty soon returned to WCW to once again be the head booker of WCW and ended his full time in-ring career. ‚Äú*Hey, aren‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ an average guy?*‚Äù

**Average Guy (Alt)**\- Dusty Rhodes began his legendary career after reading a newspaper ad about Tony Santo‚Äôs wrestling school. He soon went to WCCW and began working the circuit of southern territories, becoming a booker in Mid-Atlantic Wrestling. He formed a tag team called ‚ÄúThe Texas Outlaws‚Äù with Dick Murdoch, and even toured with Vince McMahon Sr‚Äôs WWWF in the 1970s. He‚Äôs now known for his feuds with men like Abdullah The Butcher, Terry Funk, ‚ÄúSuperstar‚Äù Billy Graham, Harley Race. His most notable feud was with Ric Flair, where the two represented different aspects of life. Flair was the rich and yuppie elite, while the heavy-set Rhodes was, well‚Ä¶ the average guy. ‚Äú*He‚Äôs just an average guy, daddy!*‚Äù

**Average Son**\- Dustin Rhodes is the real-life son of Dusty Rhodes. In the late 80s Dustin began wrestling in Championship Wrestling of Florida where his dad was already a legend. After a year-long run in WCW in 1989, and a few dates in Japan and Memphis, Rhodes followed his dad to the WWF. Dusty soon returned to book WCW in 1991, and like father like son, Dustin followed. Dustin showed his skill in the tag team ranks with Barry Windham and in the US Heavyweight Championship scene. Rhodes was fired from WCW in 1995 for blading during a King Of The Road match at Uncensored 1995. He also had fallen out with Dusty during this time. Dustin went back to the WWF in 1995, determined to win ‚Äúgold‚Äù. *Against a wrestling God like his father, he wouldn‚Äôt take the Silver medal‚Ä¶*

**Avery**\- The Backstreet Boys were a popular boy band formed in 1993 and who still tour today. The members are AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell. They had such successful hits as ‚ÄúI Want It That Way‚Äù & ‚ÄúAs Long As You Love Me‚Äù. If I had to venture a guess as to who Avery is based off of, I would say AJ McLean since when I googled ‚ÄúBackstreet Boys dreadlocks‚Äù a website came up showing McLean‚Äôs‚Ä¶ interesting hairstyles. *Avery‚Äôs back, Alright!*

**Bail Bondsman**\- The Big Boss Man (real name Ray Traylor) was a corrections officer before getting into wrestling. He joined Jim Crockett promotions in 1984 under the name of ‚ÄúBig Bubba Rogers‚Äù and served as Jim Cornette‚Äôs silent bodyguard. After a run in the UWF & All Japan he went to the WWF in 1988 as The Big Boss Man, where he formed ‚ÄúThe Twin Towns‚Äù with Akeem ‚ÄúThe African Dream‚Äù. This team was a key point in the Hogan v Savage feud, and Boss Man feuded with Hogan in a steel cage match for the WWF Heavyweight Championship. Boss Man left for WCW in 1993, then returned in 1998 as The Corporation‚Äôs head of security. Boss man was a solid midcard wrestler, winning hardcore and tag titles, until he left in the WWF in 2003. Sadly, Traylor passed away at the age of 41 in 2004. *You‚Äôre Doing Hard Time!*

**Bandsaw Buck**\- Terry Funk wrestled in every major US promotion from 1965 to 2017. In 1997 Funk debuted as ‚ÄúChainsaw Charlie‚Äù in December 1997, teaming with Mick Foley to feud with the New Age Outlaws. The feud concluded in a dumpster match at Wrestlemania XVI, then the following night in a Steel Cage on raw. The only other notable moment in this run was when Funk ran to the aid of Mankind in the infamous Hell-In-A-Cell match at King Of The Ring 1998 against The Undertaker. *I‚Äôve changed the rules! I‚Äôm a chainsaw now!* *RRRRRWWW!*

**BeastHeart**\- William Wallace was a minor Scottish noble born in 1270. Wallace was a leader in the Scottish rebellion in the first Scottish war for independence. Wallace led men in the battle of Stirling Bridge & Falkirk. In August of 1305, Wallace was captured by the English and put on trial, and quickly found guilty. He was hung, drawn, and quartered but was saved from death only to then be emasculated, eviscerated, then beheaded and cut into four pieces. His head was placed on a spike on London bridge while his limbs were put on display in Newcastle, Stirling, Berwick, & Perth. The 1995 film ‚ÄúBraveheart‚Äù is based loosely upon Wallace, and BeastHeart is based on ‚ÄúBraveheart‚Äù. *FREEDOM!*

**Beat‚Äôem Up Bo & Lee**\- Billy (Bo) & Jimmy (Lee) Lee are brothers, training partners, and rivals in the *Double Dragon* series. Both are masters of Sou-Setsu-Ken, and have a female friend named Marion. In series lore, Billy is a heroic master and wielder of the Dragon Sword, while Jimmy is secretly a crime boss named ‚ÄúThe Shadow Master‚Äù. *May You Live Happily Forever‚Ä¶*

**Beef Buffalo**\- King Kong Bundy debuted in the wWF in March 1981 under the name Chris Canyon, and soon traveled the southern territories, most notably WCCW. In WCCW, he was developed as ‚ÄúBig Daddy Bundy‚Äù (After Shirley Crabtree's ‚ÄúBig Daddy‚Äù moniker) who soon turned on the Von Erich family and began working with ‚ÄúPlayboy‚Äù Gary Hart. Bundy was Fritz Von Erich‚Äôs final opponent. In 1985, Bundy doubted once again in the WWF and beat SD Jones in nine seconds at Wrestlemania I. He was soon managed by Bobby ‚ÄúThe Brain‚Äù Heenanand teamed with Big John Studd against Andre The Giant. Under the management of Heenan, Bundy challenged Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage at Wrestlemania II in Los Angeles, California. He retired in 1988 only to return in 1995 to work in The Million Corporation before pursuing stand up comedy and acting before passing away in 2019. *Where‚Äôs the beef?*

**Beer Can Man**\- The Sandman, known as Mr.Sandman at first, began wrestling in Philadelphia in 1989, doing spots in Memphis into the early 90s. In 1992, Sandman began wrestling with his wife as his valet for ECW (Eastern Championship Wrestling, later known as Extreme Championship Wrestling) where he feuded with Don Muraco for the ECW Championship. He feuded with Tommy Cairo where it was alluded that Sandman was pimping his wife, Peaches. In 1994, Sandman began wielding a kendo stick he called a Singapore cane and later that year was blinded by Tommy Dreamer, a gimmick he kept for quite a few months. Sandman won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in 1995 against Shane Douglaus (with the aid of Woman) in a rematch for the belt. After a tepid run in WCW in 1998 he returned to ECW until its closure. *Exit Light! Enter Night!*

**Big Bad Doctor**\- Big Van Vader began his wrestling career in 1985 in the AWA under the moniker ‚ÄúBaby Bull‚Äù. Vader worked in smaller territories as a monster heel until he went to Japan in 1987. There he reigned as a foreign monster in NJPW and AJP, and nearly losing an eye against Stan Hansesn in1990. He was also a mainstay heel in WCW throughout the late 80s and 90s. He held the WCW Championship a few times, and feuded with men like Ric Flair & Sting. In 1996 he joined the WWF, and began feuding with Mankind and with Shawn Michaels for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, but floundered due to his stiff work and a bad PR. He joined Jim Cornette‚Äôs Camp Cornette stable and feuded with Undertaker and later Yokozuna before departing the WWF in 1998. *It‚Äôs Time! What Time? It‚Äôs Vader Time!*

**Big Rig**\- Kevin Nash debuted in the WWF in 1993 as ‚ÄúBig Daddy Cool‚Äù Diesel, on the request of Shawn Michaels. He was Michael's bodyguard and tag team partner. After winning the IC and Tag Team Championships he and Michaels fell out, and Diesel faced and beat Bob Backland for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Michaels won the 1995 Royal Rumble, and the two faced each other in the main event of Wrestlemania XI. Diesel lost the championship to Bret Hart at Survivor Series 1995, and had a feud with The Undertaker where he became the fifth victim of the streak, before returning to WCW. *As an Outsider‚Ä¶*

**Big Rig (Alt)-** Kevin Nash had a run in WCW in the early 90s, but returned on June 10, 1996 to aid Scott Hall in taking over WCW. Together they formed The Outsiders, then with Hulk Hogan formed the core of the NWO. He feuded with Harlem Heat, Goldberg, and even other members of the NWO over the course of his tenure with WCW. He held the Tag Team & WCW World Championship, and led the NWO Wolfpack. As WCW was closing and many wrestlers were jumping ship to the WWF, Nash stayed and sat out his AOL-Time Warner contract. As that expired, he returned to the WWF as part of the NWO. *2 Sweet!*

**Big Thugge**\- Pat Roach wrestled as ‚ÄúBomber‚Äù, and held the European & British championship at one point in his career. Roached was a recurring cast member for the Indiana Jones trilogy. He played a Nazi pilot in *Raider Of The Lost Arc*, A Gestapo officer in *The Last Crusade,* and the Thugge cult guard that Big Thugge is based off in *The Temple Of Doom*. *Gun beats sword, sword beats hand‚Ä¶*

**Blaine Fantasy**\- Shane McMahon is a fourth generation wrestling promoter. Born in 1970, McMahon debuted first as referee Shane Stevens, notably refereeing the 1988 the first ever Royal Rumble match. McMahon worked behind the scenes to launch the WWF website in 1997, while on-air he slowly began aiding his father with the Corporation stable. He had a feud with X-pac for the European Championship, where Shane had his first real match with X-Pac at WrestleMania XV. 1999 was a busy year for Shane: He had a ladder match teaming with his father against Steve Austin for control of the WWF, led the Corporate Ministry, and feuded with Test for the right to date his sister which is weird. In December of 1999, he was jumped by Triple H and was the first victim of the McMahon-Helmsley faction. *If only he could have run his own company‚Ä¶*

**Blitz**\- JBl floundered as a New Blackjack and a solo star, so in the fall of 1998 he formed The Acolytes with Faarouq (Ron Simmons), managed by The Jackel. The Acolytes were a dark, cult-like team that joined The Ministry Of Darkness. They began winning Tag Team Championships, notably beating the Hardy Boyz, before ditching the dark aspects of the gimmick when the Ministry disbanded. The Acolytes began a pair of cigar-smoking, beer-drinking, card-playing brawlers that would have their services available for the highest bidder. And the APA was born. *All worship a wrestling god!*

**Blizzard**\- The mantle of Sub-Zero in the original Mortal Kombat trilogy is manned first by Bi-Han who is killed by Scorpion in the first tournament then his brother, Kuai-Liang, for the rest. Sub-Zero is a ninja who controls ice, and is locked in a feud with Scorpion over the murder of his brother. In 1996 WCW, wrestler Raymond Llyod was hired to portray Glacier, a real-life parody of Sub-Zero for an angle called ‚ÄúBlood Runs Cold‚Äù. With a stop-and-start push and a costly effects budget (due mostly to the promotion using a movie-effects studio for Glacier's entrance), Glacier fizzled in the promotion. *The wrestling world is a cold place.*

**Blockbuster Brohan**\- At WCW‚Äôs Bash At The Beach 1996, Hogan betrayed WCW to join Scott Hall & Kevin Nash to form the NWO. Hogan claimed he was done pleasing the fans, and that he was too big a star for the wrestling world. Hogan led the NWO to cause chaos in WCW, winning and desecrating the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and taking over Pay-Per-Views. Hogan had feuds with Sting, Lex Lurger, and even other NWO members like Kevin Nash and Randy Savage. Hogan set his sights on the 2000 election, and shot an angle where he retired to run for president. *And it didn‚Äôt work for America, brother!*

**The Blitz**\- Firstly, this character may refer to the collegiate and professional Football career of Ron Simmons. I assume this because Ron Simmons was a notable collegiate athlete but had a rough time in the NFL & CFL. The Kansas City Chiefs are an American Football team that was established in 1959, and to date has five league championships. *You sadly can beat the blitz*.

**BoomBox**\- BoomBox‚Äôs rapper gimmick may refer to the rap group ‚ÄúRun DMC‚Äù, known for their high-energy sound, group dynamics, and cultural influence. I soon realized BoomBox‚Äôs merch said ‚ÄúHey! Hey! Hey!‚Äù the catch phrase of Fat Albert. Fat Albert Robionson is the main character of ‚ÄúFat Albert & The Cosby Kids‚Äù, a show based on the childhood of showrunner, comedian Bill Cosby. Albert is a fun-loving and good-hearted kid who leads a group of young boys as they navigate the troubles of life, such as drugs in schools and bullying. *Gonna have a good time, Hey! Hey! Hey!*

**Bravo Gallardo**\- Eddie Guerrero was the youngest son Gory Guerrero, inventor of the camel clutch submission hold. Guerrero was a collegiate amateur wrestler before moving to Mexico to train, then debut for WCCW as a jobber. Guerrero wrestled under the gimmick of M√°scara M√°gica in CMLL, and joined El Hijo del Santo to team in a new version of their fathers old tag team, betrayed El Hijo del Santo to team with Art Barr, and form a villain stable called ‚Äúlos Gringos Locos‚Äù. He became Black Tiger in NJPW before his most notable 90s run in WCW & ECW where he feuded with 2 Cold Scorpio, Dean Malenko, DDP, Chris Jericho, and of course, Rey Mysterio Jr. *Viva la raza!*

**Brimstone**\- Mortal Kombat came out in 1992, and for the time was considered violent for its realistic character sprites and their subsequent fatalities. One such character was Scorpion, a yellow-clad ninja (Yellow, the sneakiest of colors) who was an undead man with fire powers. Scorpion was murdered two years before the game takes place, coming back only to end the life of Sub-Zero (Bi-Han). *Get over here!*¬†

**Brit Buckingham**\- Dave Taylor was a third generation wrestler from the UK. Taylor began wrestling in the late 70/early 80s, debuting on the Welsh language program ‚ÄúReslo‚Äù. Taylor began wrestling for All Star Wrestling in 1984, though briefly defected to Joint Promotions in 1986 to participate in a British Heavyweight Championship. Taylor had a long running feud with Kendo Nagasaki that stemmed from Taylor unmasking him during a tag match, the feud ran into the 90s. In 1995, Taylor joined WCW to team with William Regal (then Steven Regal) and Bobby Eaton to form the stable ‚ÄúThe Blue Bloods‚Äù. When Eaton left the group Regal & Taylor feuded with him, and Taylor also tagged with Regal & Fit Finlay until Taylor & Regal left WCW in 2000.

**Buck Bronco**\- Terry Funk was the son of Dory Funk Sr, and began working for his father in his promotion in 1965. Funk became a mainstay of the southern territories & Japan, being a wildman and bastard like character. Funk wrestled for WCW, WCCW, AJP, ECW, CWF, The WWF, and many more. He's feuded with Cactus Jack, Jerry ‚ÄúThe King‚Äù Lawler, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes. This is a condensed version of a nearly fifty year career, with highlights like a fourteen month NWA Heavyweight Championship run & being a death match innovator. *I‚Äôve changed the rules! I‚Äôm a wrestling legend! Ding Ding!*

**Bug Buster**\- The 1984 film ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù features four men battling ghosts in the streets of New York City. Bug Buster closely resembles Dan Aykroyd‚Äôs character Ray Stantz, the heart of the team & one of the film‚Äôs main characters. *Who you gonna call?*

**Bullwhip Bart**\- Stan Hansen began wrestling in 1973 while trying to become a pro-footballer. Hansen debuted in the WWWF in 1976 and quickly entered into a feud for Bruno Samartino‚Äôs World Heavyweight Championship, where in one match he broke Bruno‚Äôs neck (see previous feud list). Hansen also wrestled in NJPW during this time facing some of its top stars, most notable being Antonio Inoki. Hansen left for AJP where was mostly a tag team specialist with men like Terry Gordy, Vader, and Bruiser Brody as well as a brawl of a match with Andre The Giant. He fought Hulk Hogan for the WWF Championship in a crossover show, and won his first Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship in 1990 against Vader, and the two had a rematch in NJPW. Hansen had feuds with Lex Lurger in WCW and a short run for ECW in 1993, all while finishing his career in AJP in 2001. *Teenie Wangers..*

**BuzzSaw (Alt)**\- Jim Hellwig began wrestling in 1985, soon teaming with Steve Borden (later known as Sting). The two first were known as The Freedom Fighters in CWA, but after a quick heel turn and a move to the UWF, they became the Blade Runners in 1986. Later that year, Hellwig split with Borden to WCCW where he was renamed ‚ÄúThe Dingo Warrior‚Äù. *Then something crazy happened..*

**BuzzSaw (80s)**\- Joining the WWF in 1987, The Warrior first kept the Dingo but was quickly redubbed The Ultimate Warrior. Between his high-energy but quick matches and crazy promos rocketed him up the card. He had beat Rick Rude and Hercules Hernandez, and squashed The Honky Tonk Man for the IC Championship in 1998 at SummerSlam. He entered into a feud with Rick Rude that lasted about all of 1989. Hulk Hogan and Warrior feuded in the main event of Wrestlemania VI, where Warrior beat Hogan for The WWF World Heavyweight Championship and became the first dual champion for the IC and World titles. After a lackluster year Warrior lost the belt to Sgt Slaughter, and ‚Äúretiring‚Äù Macho Man Randy Savage at Wrestlemania VII and he was suspended in the summer of 1991. Warrior returned to save Hulk Hogan from a post-match beatdown at Wrestlemania VIII, and after a WWF Championship match at Summerslam 1992 he was let go due to various behavior & backstage issues. *And then something crazier happened‚Ä¶*

**BuzzSaw (90s)**\- Warrior burned many bridges before returning 1996 to the WWF, now in major need of star power. He returned to squash Triple H at Wrestlemania XII, and feud with Jerry Lawler & Goldust before no-showing dates and demanding more money and merchandise rights. Hogan brought the Warrior to WCW in 1998 where Warrior formed the One Warrior Nation or OWN, and after kidnapping the guy and having a trapdoor in the ring that nearly killed The British Bulldog, he wrestled three matches, the last being against Hulk Hogan and is considered one of, if not the worst, match in the promotion‚Äôs history. Hellwig retired shortly after. *Then something racist & homophobic happened‚Ä¶*

**Cabb**\- Tazz made his debut in 1987 in the WWC first as Kid Krush before moving on to the Tazzmaniac, which he has since used many variations of since. He would wrestle for various small promotions like IWCCW where he held a Light Heavyweight Championship, CWA, and even NJPW throughout the early 90s. After wrestling dark matches for both the WWF & WCW before debuting for ECW in 1993. After returning from a neck injury in 1995, Tazz became a mainstay of ECW‚Äôs roster as the promotion‚Äôs MMA fighter, using both Taz-plexs & his Tazmission. Taz feued with Tommy Dreamer, won the World TV Title on Raw during the ECW invasion, and engaged in a feud with both Rob Van Dam & Sabu until his manager Bill Alfonso turned on him. He would hold the World TV Championship a few more times, notably losing to Bam Bam Bigelow in 1998. He then won the World Heavyweight Championship, fusing it with the FTW Championship, and held it until his departure to the WWF in late 1999. *Kataha jime!*

**Cadaver**\- Raven, real name Scott Levy, began his career in 1988 where he wrestled in small promotions in Puerto Rico, Canada, the southern US. In 1992, he began wrestling as a surfer named Johnny Flamingo and winning the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship, then defecting to the WWF in 1993 to be a manager with the gimmick of being a spoiled rich kid named ‚ÄúJohnny Polo‚Äù. In 1995, Raven became Raven by changing his look and promo style to what we know today and feuding with Tommy Dreamer, and claiming the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in 1996 during a feud with The Sandman. In 1997, Raven returned to WCW to lead his flock, a stable devoted to Raven much like his ECW stable, and compete in the midcard title scenes before leaving in 1999 after Eric Bischoff promised any wrestler that wanted it their release. Later that year he returned to ECW, winning the Tag Team Championships with Tommy Deamer. *Nevermore‚Ä¶*

**CC Sleaze**\- Diamond Dallas Page broke into the business in 1988 as a manager and color commentator. After a brief appearance at Wrestlemania IV as Rhythm & Blues driver he went to WCW, where he began training at their training facility The Power Plant. Page began working in the lower card as an obnoxious heel until 1993 where became World TV Championship and served as a mainstay of the midcard until 1996 when he became a common adversary for the newly formed NWO, mainly Randy Savage. His feud with Savage rocketted him to the main event scene where he tagged with celebrities and feuded with stars like The Giant, ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Hulk Hogan, and Goldberg. Page won his first World Heavyweight Championship in 1999, quickly turning heel and beginning his slide back down the card as the WCW management slowly began to slip. After forming the Jersey Triad and winning the Tag Titles in 2000, Page became one of the few homegrown WCW to immediately debut for the WWF after the sale of WCW. *Shoulder back, chest out!*

**Caser Sleaze**\- Dee Snider is the lead vocalist of the U.S based heavy metal rock band Twisted Sister. Dee joined Twisted Sister in 1976, becoming the lead vocalist and sole songwriter of the band. In 1984, the band‚Äôs third album ‚Äú*Stay Hungry*‚Äù became their most popular, featuring songs such as: *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Not Gonna Take It‚Äù & ‚ÄúI Wanna Rock!‚Äù*. Snider, along with other artists, appeared before the U.S. Senate to discuss music censorship. Snider still works today in music. *We‚Äôre not gonna take it!*

**Chameleon Kid**\- Koko B. Ware began wrestling in 1978 in the CWA, winning a title and becoming a special guest referee for a match for Jerry ‚ÄúThe King‚Äù Lawler & ‚ÄúThe Dream Machine‚Äù. In the match, Ware screwed Lawler out of the win, turning heel and changing his name to Sweet Sugar Brown. Ware formed tag teams throughout the southern promotions, winning tag titles and even won the vacant NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship. In 1986, Ware debuted for the WWF as the birdman, with his macaw ‚ÄúFrankie‚Äù. Ware was a mainstay of the WWF midcard into the mid-90s, notably teaming with a young Owen Hart to form High Energy. Koko B. Ware then left the WWF in 1994. *Tell‚Äôem Frankie!*

**Chance Solar**\- Han Solo (also played by actor Harrison Ford) is a space smuggler, pilot, and rebellion leader in the original Star Wars trilogy. Han is hired to fly Obi-Wan Kenobi & Luke Skywalker off of Tatooine when he is brought to the heart of a rebel plot to destroy the deathstar. He often flies with his best friend, a Wookie named Chewbanca. He also had a hectic romance with princess Leia Organa. *Never tell me the odds‚Ä¶*

**Chet Skye**\- Chet is a mix of Ricky Morton & a young Shawn Michaels, but since HFK is based solely on Michaels, get ready to learn about Morton. In 1983, Morton formed the Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Express with Robert Gibson. The Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll embarked on a legendary feud with The Midnight Express (This version being Bobby Eaton & Dennis Condrey, with Jim Cornette). This feud defined a good part of his career into the 80s although he also feuded with The Four Horsemen and The Russians. In the 90s, Morton worked with the York Foundation in WCW. In 1992, The Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll worked a long feud with The Heavenly Bodies in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, which led to a few appearances on WWF tv in 1993. The late 90s saw him go to FMW, ECW, WCW, and a return to the WWF in 1997 as part of the NWA invasion angle. *Hop aboard the Rock‚ÄôN‚ÄôRoll Express‚Ä¶*

¬†**Chicano**\- Scott Hall broke into the business in 1984 in CWF. He soon worked with industry giants like Dusty Rhodes & Curt Henning. He worked sporadically in Mid-Atlantic Wrestling and other NWA territories, but began a small run in WCW in 1989 before going to Japan, then redubting for WCW in 1991 for the Diamond Mine stable. In 1992, He came to the WWF to work under the name Razor Ramon, a tough Miami Cuban-American based off Scarface. There he won the IC Championship and worked with legends like Shawn Michaels, Goldust, and The Undertaker. *Bad times don‚Äôt last‚Ä¶*

**Chicano (Alt)**\- In 1996, Hall returned to WCW as a supposed ‚ÄúInvader‚Äù. He soon teamed with an invading Kevin Nash and Hulk Hogan to form the NWO. Hall & Nash were The Outsiders, causing chaos with ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Hulk Hogan and attacking WCW stars. After five years of Championship wins, matches, and feuds with the likes of Harlem Heat, Sting, and Sid Vicious. Sadly, Hall‚Äôs addictions caught up with him and WCW (in a display of poor taste) made it an angle on tv. Hall left WCW in 2000. *Bad Guys Do!*¬†

**Chief Buffalo**\- Chief Buffalo is an homage to the *Punch-Out!* Character, King Hippo. His alt, Beef Buffalo combines the history with British pro-wrestler Big Daddy and King Kong Bundy\*.""Don't give up, Mac! Make him close his big mouth""\*

**Chopper**\- Barry Darsow debuted in 1983, working in Hawaii & New Zealand. He began working for JCP in 1984 as an American turncoat, teaming with the Koloffs to form The Russians. In 1987, Darsow became Smash of Demolition for the WWF. Demolition became one of the most notable tag teams of the era, winning and holding the WWF Tag Team Championship for a then record reign. Demolition broke up in 1991, and Smash became the Repo Man, a villainous repo man who would not repossess anything but steal it instead. In 1995, Darsow played The Blacktop Bully who would hurl insults at the wrestlers then a feud with Dusty Rhodes. Then again in 1997, Darsow played ‚ÄúHole-In-One‚Äù Darsow, a villainous golf player. *I AM THE SMASHER!*

**Cletus Mullet**\- Okay, I have no basis for this other than that both teams are southern and rednecks. Firstly, a redneck does not refer to a sunburnt neck, but was a term for miners that wore red bandanas to show they were pro-union, little fact for ya. Okay, Tim Brooks was a wrestler and cousin of Dick Murdoch. Brooks got his start in 1967, and in 1983 sold his NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Larry Zbyszko. Brooks retired in 1998 to teach at his wrestling school, notably training Keith Lee. *Many people have broken this redneck‚Ä¶*

**Clint Delta**\- Carlos Ray Norris, later known as Chuck, was born in March 1940. Chuck had a rough childhood but joined the military, later finding a love of martial arts. Norris starred in many action movies and shows in his acting career such as ‚ÄúWalker Texas Ranger‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Force Of One‚Äù, and notably ‚ÄúDelta Force‚Äù for which I assume Clint is named. In 1994, Norris appeared to aid The Undertaker against Yokozuna in a Casket match at Survivor Series 1994. Norris, in modern day, became a meme with the premise that Norris is the most powerful being in the universe. *Chuck Norris once put together a list of rules to live by, it was later known as the laws of physics.*

**Copper/Cobra Commander**\- Cobra Commander leads the group COBRA, a paramilitary group bent on world domination. Cobra Commander assembles and leads agents, overlooks weapon development, and plots against the nations of the world. Much is unknown as to where he is from and why he does what he does. Copper Commander resembles the 1982 Real American Hero G.I¬† Joe toyline classic look of Cobra Commander wearing a robotic mask/helmet, while Cobalt Commander both resembles the original color scheme for Cobra Commander while also paying homage to Commander‚Äôs hooded look. *Cobra!*

**Crash**\- Mary Ward was the first person ever to pass away due to a motor vehicle accident in 1869. Ever since mankind has tried to prevent both automobile accidents and deaths caused by them. Firstly, with human cadavers then living volunteers and animals, but in 1949 Samuel W. Alderson made the first crash test dummy, dubbed ""Sierra Sam‚Äù. Ever since models have been produced as an engineering and safety tool. As tv went national in the united states PSA‚Äôs featuring crash test dummies were made to show the importance of seatbelts, which later inspired the The Incredible Crash Test Dummies toyline in 1993. *You could learn a lot from a dummy. Wear your seatbelt.*

**Crash Ratchethands**\- Edward Scissorhands is a humanoid made by an inventor. He‚Äôs the main character of the 1990 movie ‚ÄúEdward Scissorhands‚Äù, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. The story is a modern day inversion of the Beauty And The Beast, Pinocho, & Frankenstein where the awkward Edward must navigate suburbia while lacking social awareness, a large amount of gullibility, and giant scissors instead of working hands. *I am not complete‚Ä¶*

**Crouching Tiger**\- Yoshihiro Taijiri broke into the business in 1994 for the IWA Japan, working for CMLL & BJW where he won the BJW Junior Heavyweight Championship before working for NJPW in 1995. In 1996, Taijiri worked on a few episodes of Monday Night Raw while doing spots for CMLL until 1999, when he then went on to work for ECW. During the first part of his ECW tenure he had a feud with Little Guedo and Super Crazy while paying homage to The Great Muta, spraying green mist and sporting new tights. He fought Tazz and Justin Credible for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win. He joined The Network and won the ECW World TV Championship, reigniting his feud with Little Guedo and Super Crazy in a three-way dance match, then turning on The Network. He lost the TV Championship to Rhyno, then formed the Unholy Alliance with Mikey Whipwreck to win the ECW World Tag Team Championships. Taijiri became a mainstay of ECW until its closure, wrestling on the promotion‚Äôs last two shows against Super Crazy. *Taijiri! Taijiri!*

**Curt Grunge**\- Kurt Cobian was the lead singer and guitarist of the Grunge Rock band, Nirvana. Cobain and the band were considered to be a catalyst for 90s Alt culture and a music legend. Cobian often experimented with religion, sexuality and sexual identity, and drugs. Cobain formed Nirvana in high school, and when Dave Grohl and with the release of the band‚Äôs 1991 breakout album *Nevermind*, the band entered the Gen X zeitgeist. Despite their meteoric rise to fame and fortune, Cobain suffered from mental illness and self-medicated. Kurt Donald Cobain ended his own life on April 5th, 1994 at the young age of 27. *Seattle‚Äôs finest, the man not the coffee.*

**Curt Grunge (Alt)**\- Billy Kidman broke into the wrestling industry in 1994 under the name of Kid Flash, being trained by Afa of the Wild Samoans. Kid began working for WCW in 1996 as a jobber, losing to wrestlers like Chris Kanyon, DDP, and Dean Malenko. In 1997, Kidman joined Raven‚Äôs flock under the gimmick of a drug addict, staying in the group until 1998 when he aided Perry Saturn in disbanding The Flock by beating Raven. Kidman remained in the midcard cruiserweight title scene, beating Jeuventue Guerrera to win his first championship and losing, regaining, and defending against men like Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, and Disco Inferno. In 1999 he joined The Filthy Animals,turned heel to join The New Blood, and teamed with Rey Mysterio to be the last WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions in 2001. (Blame WCW‚Äôs booking for that erratic list). *Never powerbomb kidman‚Ä¶*¬†

**Cutthroat**\- In 1960, The Oakland area would form the Oakland Raiders football team. Its colors are silver and black, and its mascot is Raider Rusher (who looks similar to Cutthroat). In 1980, The Raiders beat The Philadelphia Eagles 27-10 to win their second Superbowl, the previous win being 1976, and becoming the first wildcard team to win The Superbowl. The Raiders moved to LA in 1982, back to Oakland in 1994, then to Las Vegas in 2019 where they now play out of. *Raider Dave!*

**Cutthroat (Alt)**\- William Eadie began in the Detroit territory in December 1972 under the ring name The Paramedic. Eadie toured the NWA territories like Georgia Championship Wrestling, Mid-Atlantic Wrestling, & even spots in Canada in 1985. He first wrestled for the WWF in 1983, appearing sporadically to fight big stars like Hulk Hogan, Bob Backlund, Jimmy Snuka, and Sgt. Slaughter. His main gimmick during his touring days was under a masked, uncreatively named ‚ÄúThe Masked Superstar‚Äù. In 1987, he became Ax in the tag team Demolition, which was a mainstay of the late 1980s WWF tag team scene. The team won three WWF Tag Team Championships, and were #1 & #2 in the 1989 Royal Rumble match. Eadie left the WWF after the 1991 Survivor Series. *I AM THE AX!*¬†¬†¬†",4,1754212755.0,80sManiaWrestling,0,1.0,False

Opinions?,"I'm 25f and I've been on exactly 5 dates in total with 5 different people. For all of them I suggested grabbing a bite to eat, get some coffee or do something fun like a cinema or something. None of them liked the idea of meeting up for an hour or two. They wanted to spend the whole day with me. I was surprised, because I always thought a date was supposed to last only a couple of hours. But I live in The Netherlands and I'm pretty introverted, so I thought it was just me being weird and I went along with it, but I didn't really like it. For most of these dates, we met up at like 12PM and I would leave at 9 or 10PM. When I tell you I was *exhausted*. I'm not really good at spending such a long time with people who are still essentially strangers.

So a few days ago I talked to my mom and this topic came up. Her reaction was: ""All day? That seems really long. Did you want that?"" And I was like: ""No! I just thought that's how it's supposed to go."" Because if 5 different people want to meet up for a whole day, then I must be the odd one out. But I'm like, what would you even talk about on the second and third date if you spend a whole day together??

Now I'm not saying that if two people feel comfortable meeting up for a whole day, they shouldn't do it. Go for it! I guess I'm just wondering if I'm weird for not wanting to.

Please refrain from asking any questions about it.

I missed the very first scene of episode 2 because I had to step out to the restroom, but the first part I saw was Ayaka‚Äôs nightmare sequence. The screening ended with the scene where Hansa throws a coffee cup at Jester to start a fight. Episode 2 didn‚Äôt have as many action scenes as episode 1. The few action moments it had included a brief standoff between an Assassin and a group of police officers + Dead Apostle Jester overwhelmingly defeating the police officers one by one, who were using their Noble Phantasms.

The most impressive scene in episode 2 was the insane performance by the voice actor playing Jester. Kana Hanazawa mentioned that she recorded alongside Tatsumaru Tachibana, and that his performance as Jester was so impressive it gave her goosebumps. Also, what stuck with me the most was that in an interview after the screening, Ayaka‚Äôs voice actress, Kana Hanazawa, said the direction during Jester‚Äôs first appearance in episode 2 was disgusting. That comment really stayed with me.

The part I found hardest to understand in episode 2 was how the police officers, each carrying a Noble Phantasm, managed to obtain and use them in the first place. How did they even get their hands on weapons meant for Servants? Also, when Jester said that ""human Noble Phantasms don‚Äôt work on Dead Apostles,"" I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what he meant by that.

Have you ever felt like your home is working *against* you?

Maybe it‚Äôs that awkward kitchen corner you keep bumping into. Or the living room that never quite feels cozy, no matter how many times you rearrange the furniture. Or the bedroom where something always feels... off.

You may not realize it at first, but these small frustrations start to add up. And more often than not, the root of the problem is something homeowners rarely think about until it‚Äôs too late:

 **Poor space planning.**

 

**The Chaos of a Misaligned Home**

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîour homes are more than just pretty pictures on Pinterest. They‚Äôre the spaces where we live, grow, rest, and reconnect. When your space isn‚Äôt planned with intention, everything starts to feel harder than it should:



* Mornings become a scramble because storage is inconvenient.
* Cooking feels stressful in a poorly laid-out kitchen.
* Guests feel awkward because there‚Äôs no clear flow in the living room.
* And despite all the d√©cor, something just doesn‚Äôt *feel* right.



It‚Äôs not just about square footage‚Äîit‚Äôs about **how your home supports your life**.

 

**A True Story: ‚ÄúWe Designed Our Home Backwards‚Ä¶‚Äù**

A client once came to us feeling completely disheartened. Their home was recently renovated‚Äîstylish, well-finished, full of trendy furniture. But after moving in, they realized something important was missing: *comfort*.

They couldn‚Äôt figure out why daily life felt so disorganized. Why their new wardrobe couldn‚Äôt fit half their clothes. Why the kids were always tripping over things. Why they felt exhausted just being at home.

The truth? The design looked great on paper‚Äîbut no one had thought about how the family would actually *live* in the space.

We redesigned their home from the inside out‚Äî**starting with how they live, not how the space looks.** And the change? It was life-altering.

 

**What Is Good Space Planning, Really?**

Good space planning is more than just measurements and furniture layouts.

It‚Äôs asking:



* Where do you start your mornings?
* How do you move from room to room?
* Where does the light fall in the afternoon?
* How many people are in the kitchen at once?
* Where do your children study, rest, and play?



When a home is designed around your real needs, **everything flows**. Suddenly, your home feels like it *understands you*. It supports you. It energizes you.

 

**Signs Your Home May Be Poorly Planned**

If any of these sound familiar, it may be time to rethink your space:



* You constantly shift furniture to ‚Äúmake it work.‚Äù
* There‚Äôs never enough storage‚Äîno matter how many cabinets you add.
* Spaces feel cramped, even when the home is large.
* Natural light doesn‚Äôt reach the right places.
* You avoid using certain rooms because they feel uncomfortable.



 

**A Well-Planned Home Feels Different**

Here‚Äôs what happens when space is planned right:

You breathe easier. Mornings are smoother. You find joy in small rituals‚Äîlike coffee at just the right corner bathed in morning sun. Your children have room to grow, move, and be themselves. Your spaces feel *calm*, *open*, and *yours*.

That‚Äôs the power of thoughtful space planning‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about where the sofa goes. It‚Äôs about creating a home that‚Äôs aligned with the rhythm of your life.",1,1754212060.0,u_Tanishdzignz,0,1.0,False

It had been abandoned since my wife and I moved in two years ago. The Tanaka family owned it, but lived in Kyoto and left the house to rot. At least they came out once a month to cut the weeds. An elderly man and woman, the Tanakas, I hadn‚Äôt seen them in a while. The grass was now as tall as I was. Never been that bad before.

I didn‚Äôt understand why they kept it. They never used it, and were probably losing money on having to pay property taxes. If they let it get worse than this, I had plans to buy it off them, level it, and use the space for a bigger yard.

Nanok, my three-year-old Siberian husky, had never stopped in front of that house before.

‚ÄúHey buddy, what wrong?‚Äù I asked. Went to pet his head.

He growled, so I retracted my hand. Not that I was afraid he‚Äôd bite me. More that I had never heard him growl like this before.

I looked at the house. Crickets were jumping from long grass blades. Cicada were singing their summer songs from the eaves. The windows were shuttered. The mailbox was overflowing with envelopes and fliers. Nothing out of the ordinary, not for this place at least.

‚ÄúCome on, Nan boy. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I tugged at his leash. He refused to move until I pulled a secret weapon out of my pocket.

Deer jerky.

It broke his trance, and he followed me. Took the meat into his mouth.

But he kept looking back at the house, as if he expected something to come out of it.

The rest of our walk was uneventful. Normal jogging around a forest trail for an hour in near one hundred degrees and full humidity. I was exhausted. Nanok could keep going for days. Why did I ever think I could keep up with a sled dog? I was never a runner. Didn‚Äôt even play sports as a kid. Maybe this was my midlife crisis, trying to be as energetic as possible before it was too late.

I had moved to Japan from California ten years ago. Lived in Tokyo most of that time, doing translations for lawyers and real estate agents. My dream was to write English translations of obscure Japanese horror novels. What I did instead was decipher penal codes and zoning restrictions.

Kei‚Äîmy wife‚Äîand I had enough of city living. Something about being crammed into a subway like canned tuna had a way of wearing us down. So we got this house way out in the countryside. Only two other homes on our street. The empty house I already told you about, and an old farmhouse on the other side of us where the Saito family‚Äîmom, dad, little boy‚Äîlived.

All around us nothing but rice paddies, forest, and a few other abandoned homes. There are maybe fifty people living in this hamlet, but nobody near us aside from the Saitos.

Nanok and I came back from our run, but I cut through the rice fields so we didn‚Äôt have to walk in front of that house on the way back.

I think even then I knew something was wrong with that place, but refused to admit it.

We walked in through the front door, and I took Nanok‚Äôs harness off.

‚ÄúHey babe, hot day?‚Äù Kei asked me from the kitchen. Nanok sped away to say hi to her.

‚ÄúOnly always. Want to see me wring the sweat out of my shirt?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNot if you don‚Äôt want it getting into your dinner.‚Äù

I walked into the kitchen. She was at the counter cutting vegetables. I hugged her from behind.

‚ÄúGross! You‚Äôre soaked.‚Äù

I squeezed her waist and let go. ‚ÄúGet over it.‚Äù

Nanok jumped on her next and almost knocked her over. She pushed over an onion trying to find her balance. I grabbed it before Nanok could get to it. Washed it off and handed it back to her.

Laughing, she said, ‚ÄúYou know everything was all peace and quiet before you two came home. Now look at all the chaos you‚Äôve brought.‚Äù

I winked at her and went to take a shower. The sunset was bleeding in through the windows, bathing the house with a golden light that felt like love itself wrapping around me.

That moment still stands out to me like the sun on a cloudless morning. Even as I type all of this.

It was the last time I was truly happy.

Later that night, after dinner and some drinks out on our porch, we went to bed.

For three years now, Nanok had slept with us. Every single damn night. I used to get annoyed that he‚Äôd wedge himself in-between us and shove me towards the edge.

Kei went to bed about an hour before me. I could hear her snoring. After I smoked a cigarette outside, Nanok came upstairs with me. I went into the room. He stayed out in the hall.

I whispered, ‚ÄúHey guy, come on.‚Äù I waved for him to follow me in.

He refused.

Cried slightly.

I bent down and checked his paws and face to see if he got hurt somehow. Nothing wrong with him from what I could see. I stood and patted my knees. He stared into the room, past me, at the window that was over the headrest of the bed.

There was nothing out there save for the neighbor‚Äôs house. I could see the faint outline of the shuttered window next door.

Although we were out in a rural area with plenty of land around, whoever built the homes on this street thought it‚Äôd be good to have them as close as possible to one another.

On three sides of our house, there was nothing but fields next to it.

But if I opened my bedroom window and poked a broom handle out, I could touch that shuttered window. We didn‚Äôt mind too much since no one lived there. Had mostly gotten used to it by now.

I wouldn‚Äôt have thought any of it if it hadn‚Äôt been for what happened earlier in the day.

I walked over to the window and looked out.

Nothing there but the dark face of the house.

Nanok started growling.

I turned around. The hall light reflected off his eyes, giving them a ghostly green glow.

My blood ran cold, and the hair on my arm stood as straight as Nanok‚Äôs hackles did. I suddenly found it really hard to turn around and look at the window.

Nanok got up from his sit and stood firm as if ready to fight.

More deep growls.

I thought I heard scratching at the window, but I can‚Äôt be sure since Nanok was so loud. I glanced down at Kei, the world‚Äôs heaviest sleeper. Knew if there was any danger here, I needed to act.

I turned around.

But of course, there was nothing there.

Didn‚Äôt stop Nanok from growling, though.

I closed the curtains. Never really had cause to close them before save for keeping the morning light off us. But tonight, it felt like we needed to, I don‚Äôt know, hide. I tried to ignore that feeling as childish, but it wouldn‚Äôt leave me.

The moment I shut the curtains, Nanok stopped growling and laid down.

He never came into the room that night. I left the door open and the hall light on, well, because the whole thing freaked me out. Planned on waking up before Kei to turn off the light so I wouldn‚Äôt worry her. She‚Äôs easily spooked.

I drifted off to sleep. Mindful that the window was inches from my head. And the next-door house only feet from that. But Nanok didn‚Äôt stir for the rest of the night.

As I fell asleep, I thought I heard a loud whistle coming from the forest.

The next morning I slept in. Kei got up before me, so she must have seen the light on in the hall and Nanok sleeping out there. I heard her getting ready for work while I climbed out of bed.

I stumbled out like a drunk man and walked out into the hall. Nanok was still there and stretched out his front legs when he saw me. Wagged his tail and I scratched behind his ears.

‚ÄúBabe! I‚Äôm leaving now. Made you some breakfast,‚Äù she called up to me from downstairs.

‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù I yelled back. Heard her grab her keys and head outside. She works in the city a few days a week, while I‚Äôve been working at home for a year now. Heard the car engine roar to life and Kei drive off.

Went downstairs. Ate the scrambled eggs and drank the black coffee Kei prepped for me. Hooked Nanok up to his harness and went outside.

It was still early, so the sun wasn‚Äôt a full-on death ray yet, but close.

Once we hit the forest, it‚Äôd cool down significantly.

I couldn‚Äôt see the Saito house from mine since it was around a grove of orange trees. But I saw a flashing light through the leaves that looked like a cop car. I wondered if Mr. Saito, a man in his late fifties, had a heart attack. Made a mental note to go check on them after the run.

We walked past the abandoned house.

Nanok went ballistic.

Started barking and frothing at the mouth the moment we got near it. Jumped up, and I had to hold him back by the leash. As I drug him away, I noticed something had changed about the house.

The window on the second story, the one that was directly across from my bedroom window, the shutters were wide open.

This bothered me while we ran in the forest. No amount of running and sweating and avoiding giant hornets could take my mind off of that. I gave that house a good look yesterday when Nanok first acted weird around it. That shutter was closed. And last night before I pulled the curtains. They were closed.

Even if there had been wind last night‚Äîwhich there wasn‚Äôt‚Äîthe shutters were built like an accordion that folds out. Something you would have to push open from the inside, not something that just gets blown open.

We came back from the run, again cutting through the field to avoid the house. Not just for Nanok not to go crazy, but now I was started be uneasy around the place as well.

The day went on. Nanok took his nap. I forgot to visit the Saitos. I translated a land deed for a Chinese businessman who wanted to build a Pachinko parlor where a park stood. Hated doing that, but money has got to be made somehow.

It was about ten a.m. when my doorbell chimed.

I got out of my chair and answered the front door.

It was a cop behind him, Mr. Saito and his wife. Mr. Saito‚Äôs eyes were red and glassy. His normally perfectly combed hair a rat‚Äôs nest. Mrs. Saito was clutching her skirt so hard her knuckles turned white.

‚ÄúSaito-san, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked in my broken Japanese. Just because I translate things on paper doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm fluent in real conversations.

‚ÄúJason, sorry to bother you. Have you seen Ryota?‚Äù

Ryota was his seven-year-old boy.

‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs lips quivered. Mrs. Saito‚Äôs shoulders shook.

The cop spoke up, ‚ÄúSir, their son has been missing since this morning. We‚Äôve been searching the area all morning. We came by here earlier, but you weren‚Äôt home. You‚Äôre sure you haven‚Äôt seen anything?‚Äù

I started explaining that, no; I hadn‚Äôt. Until I remembered Nanok‚Äôs odd behavior from yesterday. As strange as it felt to talk about it, especially since I hadn‚Äôt even said anything to Kei yet, I told them about the weird vibes I was getting from the house.

The cop looked at me as if I were making it up. I couldn‚Äôt read the expressions on the Saito‚Äôs faces. The cop said he‚Äôd check out the house. The couple thanked me and bowed.

Before they turned around, an idea surfaced. ‚ÄúWait. Do you sleep with your curtains closed?‚Äù

The cop squinted his face like I had just said something offensive.

‚ÄúUh, no. We don‚Äôt have curtains,‚Äù Mrs. Saito said with apprehension.

‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù Mr. Saito said.

I could feel the cop‚Äôs stare and the accusation in his eyes. I could feel the confusion mixed with hope in the Saitos.

‚ÄúNothing, sorry.‚Äù I closed the door on them.

*Wait to go*, I thought. *Give them reason to suspect the lone foreigner in the village.*

I was curious if the cop was going to check next door. I went upstairs, Nanok on my heels, and looked out through the guest bedroom window. I saw the cop walk by the Tanaka house with the couple as they stayed on the street. He waded through the grass and knocked on the door. No one answered. He walked around the house, disappearing under the unruly grass. Looked in through some windows, vanished going around the house, and came back to the couple.

I heard him say, ‚ÄúAll shuttered up.‚Äù

I moved away from the window and sat on the floor. Nanok crawled into my lap like he was still a puppy and fell asleep.

I patted his head. Thought about last night. Nanok growling at the window. That whistle right before I fell asleep. Ryota missing.

I knew the cop wouldn‚Äôt break into the house on my word alone; he‚Äôd need something more concrete for probable cause.

But I could do it when nobody was looking. I doubted the Tanakas would even care, or notice, given how badly they had let the property fall apart recently.

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find anything, wasn‚Äôt convinced something was even to be found, maybe Ryota just got lost in the woods?

I knew that was stupid. The kid was a scaredy-cat and never went outside without his mom nearby.

I pushed Nanok off of me, got up, and went back downstairs to finish work.

And forgot all about it.

I got caught up in my translations and didn‚Äôt notice that the sun was dipping below the hills. Red light cascaded over the rice paddies, and dragonflies flitted over the small pools between the stalks. It was gorgeous, quiet, exactly what we had always wanted.

Nanok sauntered over to me and head-butted me in the stomach.

Time for a run.

We skirted around the neighbor‚Äôs house by going through the fields. Seeing it lit up red in the sunset, with deep and thickening shadows in the overgrown yard, gave me an uneasy feeling about the place.

Like it was getting ready to do something.

Nanok and I stuck to the roads since it was too dark to go into the forest this time.

Without work to distract me, I thought about Ryota. If there were going to be a search party, I wanted to join. I didn‚Äôt see anyone out all day, though. Decided to walk by the Saito‚Äôs farmhouse on the way home to ask them or see if they needed help in any other way.

Vowed not to forget this time.

About ten minutes from our street, I heard that whistle again. Nanok tensed up.

I got him walking again, and we came to the Saito farmhouse.

Nanok stopped first, just around the corner from their place, and growled.

I froze for a moment, and tugged at his leash for him to follow me, which he did hesitantly. When we rounded the bend, I saw the Saito‚Äôs minivan in the driveway, and a cop car, all the doors open, nobody inside.

The sun had fully set by now, save for a smoldering bruise of deep red just above the tree line. Like a few embers buried under ash, but still burning.

‚ÄúSaito-san!‚Äù I yelled.

No one answered.

I tried to walk to their front door, but Nanok refused to be led there. Started barking and even snarled. He pulled me away, towards the street.

Whistling in the trees. High-pitched.

I think I saw a branch over the roof of the farm sway as if something had landed on it.

Something heavy.

I held onto Nanok‚Äôs leash and ran back home. I saw Kei‚Äôs olive green Yaris Cross already in the drive.

Once inside, I unhooked Nanok‚Äôs harness and whipped out my phone to call the police.

I hit send on my phone and called out, ‚ÄúBabe!‚Äù

Pressed the phone to my ear, but I got nothing but static. One lovely thing about living so far in the boonies is that reception can be spotty. That‚Äôs why we installed a booster antenna on the roof last year to avoid this exact problem. Something must have been messing with the antenna.

Aside from the static, all I could hear was Nanok growling again, from upstairs.

I did not hear my wife.

‚ÄúKei!?‚Äù

Nothing.

I put my phone away and ran upstairs. Saw Nanok outside our bedroom in the hall. Looking more wolf with his bared teeth than he did husky.

I stepped up next to him and looked into the room.

The window lay in pieces all across the bed.

Kei‚Äôs work shirt was on the blanket, her pajama pants too, like she was halfway into changing and then left it all.

And outside the shattered window, I saw the shutter across the way close. Two long and gnarled fingers gripping its side before it shut.

All my insides felt like they were falling through the floor and into the center of the earth.

‚ÄúKei!‚Äù I screamed.

Ran downstairs. Grabbed a serrated knife from the kitchen and a flashlight from the hall closet. Nanok was still by my side, ready to go with me.

‚ÄúStay!‚Äù I shut the door on him and ran over to the Tanaka house.

No lights in the shuttered windows. Some indentation in the grass from where the cop stepped into the yard earlier.

I walked onto the grass. It was impossible to see what was at my feet, even with the flashlight. Anything could have been hiding in that grass, and I‚Äôd never see it until it was right on me.

I walked up to the front door and tried the handle.

Locked. A piece of wood nailed across the door as an extra barrier. I‚Äôd never noticed that before from the street. The wood was sturdy but looked like a firm kick could break it. Regardless, it was obvious no one had used this door in years. I ran along the side of the house, tripping on unseen obstacles in the grass, checking all the windows. Every one of them nailed and boarded shut.

I stood beneath the window I saw close. The side of the home‚Äôs wood was rotted, and I could tear off pieces of it. I dug my hands into it, ripping open handholds. Got a splinter jammed under my index fingernail on my right hand. I put the knife in the back pocket of my shorts and squeezed the flashlight under my chin. With my free hands, I clawed at the side of the house and climbed up. Made it to the window. Thought it would be locked like everything else, but it opened easily. I pushed the shutter aside with my right hand. Let the flashlight fall to the floor inside, and heaved myself over the windowsill. Got to my feet, grabbed the light, and took out the knife.

I couldn‚Äôt comprehend what I was seeing at first. I was in an old bedroom. The bed with its moldy green mattress was in the corner. The floor, walls, and ceiling were covered in a ridged and black fungus. It grew a foot or so out of the wood. It fell apart easily when I stepped on it. There were things floating in the air, dust I hoped, spores I feared. Some poster of girls in swimsuits on the wall. Faded and bleached by time. A dresser full of tattered clothing.

I looked to my left, at the wall by the window, and saw carvings made in the fungus.

Dozens of images of my house. Of me, Kei, and Nanok. Carrying boxes from the moving van into the house. Of me mowing the lawn. Making love in our bed. Even of me hugging Kei from behind in the kitchen.

One of Kei with her eyes closed, a bite taken out of her chest. Of my dog‚Äôs head severed from his body. Of me, chained to the floor.

A whistle.

I spun around and saw something duck out of sight into the hall beyond the room.

I wanted to call out Kei‚Äôs name but couldn‚Äôt. Fear gripped my throat and refused to release me. The light bounced as my hands shook. The knife almost slipped out of my hand; it was so sweaty. I didn‚Äôt even care about the splinters in my fingers.

I walked towards the hallway.

A heavy breathing somewhere down the hall. Spores and dust so thick I couldn‚Äôt see more than a few feet down it. A dank, moldy smell filled the air.

‚ÄúK-kei?‚Äù

My voice cracked.

A whimper from somewhere in the dark.

I bit my lip and forced myself to hurry up and stepped into the hall.

The fungus was so overgrown I had to duck my head as I walked. Once I had to turn sideways to move forward. It was a cave entrance more than a hallway.

A hole to my right. Another room. I flashed the light inside, and something reflected it back to me.

Chains. Bolted to the floor. No fungus grew near them. In fact, a perfect circle of wood with something that looked like Japanese, but wasn‚Äôt, scribbled on the floor. A stone square in front of the chains. Stained red. Children‚Äôs toys like stuffed rabbits and rubber balls in the corner.

Whistling behind me.

Nothing there but the fungus-ridden wall. Until I saw something above me, on the ceiling, scurrying away. Something bigger than me.

I fell on my ass and flashed the light at it.

Caught one of its legs before it disappeared down the hall by the landing to the stairs. It had plates of black fungus growing out of its pale skin.

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù came my wife‚Äôs voice from downstairs.

I grit my teeth and got to my feet. Every fiber of my being did not want to run down that hall, but my wife was down there. I raced down that fucking hallway and came to the stairs.

Downstairs was a void. The light couldn‚Äôt reveal anything. Thick clouds of spores swirled around. It didn‚Äôt make me cough, but I feared what it was doing to my insides.

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù

I took the steps. Each of them uneven because of the growths. Hard to keep my balance on them. I refused to touch the wall for support.

Got to the bottom floor.

Walked into what could have been a living room.

The flashlight uncovered a face. Buried in the wall.

The cop who came to my door.

I shoved the flashlight and knife into my pockets and grabbed the fungus encasing him. I ripped off a chunk of it to free him and noticed his head wasn‚Äôt attached to anything but that chunk. His spine hung down from his open neck like a cut telephone cord. The head fell to the ribbed floor, and spores shot up like volcanic ash.

I inhaled the shit and coughed so hard it felt like the inside of my throat tore open. When I recovered, I flashed the light around the room and saw more faces in the wall.

Mr. Saito.

Mrs. Saito.

Both of them without their bodies. Stuck like ornaments on the wall. I backed up, sweat drenching my clothes, heart beating so loudly I couldn‚Äôt hear anything else. Hoping, wishing with all that I had that I wouldn‚Äôt see another face, one more dear to me.

I kept moving backwards until I reached what looked like the kitchen. Faint outlines of what was probably once the sink and fridge, now nothing more than tumorous outgrowths of the fungus.

Something blue draped over the sink.

A pair of Spider-Man pajamas. I knew Ryota liked the character. It was about the only kind of shirt he liked to wear.

It had a tear running down it from neck to crotch.

Dark stains mixed in with the blue.

There was something in the corner, to the right of the fridge, that looked like the hunched-over silhouette of a person.

I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to tell what I saw‚Ä¶

But it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to you if I didn‚Äôt.

It was little Ryota.

Not decapitated like his parents.

Opened up like a flower greeting the sun. Black fungus growing out of the hollowed-out portion of his chest, reaching several feet out from it like spider legs. Arms spread in a mock crucifixion, pinned to the walls by the fungus. Obsidian stalks growing out of his eyes. Black tar pooling around his mouth.

I vomited.

Turned around to search the rest of the house when I heard something like dry grass rustling.

Swiveled the light back over at Ryota.

He was moving. The eye stalks twitched and curled. His hands broke free of their mold restraints. And he looked at me, if you could call what he did looking. His stalks, like insect antenna, felt around in the air, as if trying to sense where I was.

He moaned a dry and gravely cry.

One of pain.

And hunger.

I ran, but couldn‚Äôt leave yet. Kei had to be somewhere in that house, but I wasn't done with looking around. I resolved to check the rest of the first floor before Ryota really got to moving. He seemed to move slowly to me.

I went into the bathroom, two of the bedrooms, screaming Kei‚Äôs name all while I could hear Ryota take a few shuffling steps out from his corner.

There was one last room at the end of the hall, but the mold grew so closely I had to get on my hands and knees and push myself through a tunnel of it.

Ryota was in the hall behind me now. I glimpsed him as I crawled through that tunnel. Could hear him scratching along the floor. I don‚Äôt think he had feet anymore.

I squeezed through a tighter section of the tunnel. I felt the fungus smear all over my neck, scalp, and face. It was warm and greasy. I kept going until I came pouring out into the master bedroom. I frantically scanned the room with the light.

Nothing.

It was a pure black void. Mold covering everything. What was once a bed nothing more than a tomb of filth. Dressers reduced to rubble under the weight of the fungus. A ceiling fan drooped towards the ground. Like everything was melting in slow motion.

I was trapped. I know it was stupid to go into that room, but I knew Kei had to be in here somewhere. I would rather have died than give up on her.

But she wasn‚Äôt in here.

Scratching behind me.

Ryota came scuttling into the room. The fungal appendages jutting from his chest clawed at the ground and propelled him forward. He never moved his human limbs.

I moved towards the bed, keeping him on the other side of it. I pulled out the knife and pointed it at the child. The knife had teeth but no sharp end. In my haste to leave my house, I didn‚Äôt even reflect on how I would use it.

‚ÄúRyota, stop. Please.‚Äù

But I knew it was useless. The kid was dead. Whatever this was, it wasn‚Äôt him.

Ryota moved towards the bed, the fungal arms jerking like a robotic crab. It climbed up onto the bed.

Thankfully, it was slow.

I ran around to the other side of the bed and dove back into the tunnel before it jumped off. I dropped the light as I forced my body through the tunnel but still held onto the knife. Made it through the tunnel and stood.

But couldn‚Äôt see a thing.

I put my hands out in front of me and walked quickly towards where I thought the front door was. I knew it was barred, but I didn‚Äôt trust myself to locate the stairs and make it back the way I came. The front door should have been a straight shot from the hallway.

I bumped into a wall. My hands slid across the wall, me hysterically muttering to myself, trying for the door handle.

Took a moment, but I found it. Unlocked it and shoved the door. It opened slightly, but the wooden bar from outside stopped it from going further. The wind blew in through a gap big enough to slip a hand through. Even though it was hot outside, it was so much cooler than inside that house. It brought me instant relief. Nanok was barking madly, and I heard him slamming his body against the front door of my house.

I took the knife and started sawing away at the wooden bar. Thankful I had grabbed the wrong sort of knife after all. The teeth actually caught and ate into the wood.

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù

Can you feel hope and terror all at once?

That‚Äôs how I felt when I heard my wife‚Äôs voice coming from the kitchen.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go,‚Äù she said.

I kept sawing at the wood. It couldn‚Äôt be her; I had checked every single fucking inch of that house.

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù She started sobbing now.

I looked behind me but didn‚Äôt let up on the sawing.

Too dark to see her.

A vague impression that a woman was standing a few feet away from me. Where her head should have been, I saw something big, writhing like a worm.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me,‚Äù she said as she took a step closer.

The wooden bar broke in two. I kicked the door, and it budged but didn‚Äôt fully open. Two more times and it was wide enough for me to leave. Before I did, I felt a greasy caress on the back of my neck.

I ran outside and through the tall grass of the front yard.

Turned around once I made it to the street. Saw a pale naked body at the front door. My wife‚Äôs body.

Something dark and insect-like where her head should have been. She shut the door.

Later that night, I burned that entire fucking house to the ground. Remember how I said it was so close to my house? Yeah, mine went up too. Half the fields surrounding the house as well.

Nanok sat by my side as we watched it all burn. The embers shot into the charcoal sky like fireflies. The screaming of those‚Ä¶ things inside.

Nanok whimpered, and his body shook. I think he knew who was burning inside that house.

My everything is who it was.

I wept and buried my face in Nanok‚Äôs fur.

Under the grief and sorrow, there was still fear.

What took my wife?

What took the Saito family and the cop?

Because all I saw in that house were the remains of people. Not the thing that must have taken them there in the first place.

As I watched the fire burn everything down, reducing my future and my happiness to nothing, clutching my dog to my side, I heard a sharp whistle from the trees.",2,1754211740.0,creepcast,2,1.0,False
1mgekvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mgekvq/caffeine_makes_me_anxious_and_jittery_but_only_in/,Caffeine makes me anxious and jittery - but ONLY in Coffee,"This is a super weird thing I have that I cannot explain for the life of me and also can't find any explanation online for.

Quite early when I started drinking coffee, I noticed how after drinking it, coffee made me extremly anxious, jittery and light headed. I've grown up with an anxiety disorder, so I figured caffeine just made it worse, switched over to decaf and everything was fine. One thing I did notice is that other drinks with caffeine, like a coke, did not trigger this effect, most likely due to much lower caffeine. So I avoided anything high caffeine, like energy drinks. But then again - I'm a university student in STEM. I had to run into energy drinks eventually. I usually only sipped a little bit on my gf's energies bc I never dared drinking my own since my bad reactions to coffee. At some point, I did drink one and have a few times after that and NONE, i mean NONE! have triggered this anxious, jittery effect. But if I were to make me a coffee with caffeine right now, it would make me anxious. So what the hell am I reacting to? I dont seem to be allergic to coffee itself, since I can drink decaf with no problems, and caffeine can't be the main trigger either. It also can't be in my head since this ALSO happens, when I'm not aware of having drunk coffee with caffeine in it. So what is it?

Some additional notes that might help?

- I got ADHD, caffeine doesn't really work for me. It doesn't make me feel more awake or productive. Sometimes it even makes me sleepy. (pretty much rendering the energy drinks i drank during exam phases as pretty useless, but whatever)

- Mentioned before, I have/had anxiety, had it for a very long time, now on my meds it has gotten way better and is pretty much almost gone.

- I dont have any allergies really",1,1754211557.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

1mgeisz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1mgeisz/raised_baptistevangelical_and_now_discerning/,Raised Baptist/evangelical and now discerning Catholicism but parents are anti-catholic.,"TLDR; raised Baptist, parents very anti-catholic taught me that the church is one great big heresy. Through my own study I have come to realise that I was fed lies about the church and am seriously considering conversion. Dad has major issues with my attending Sunday mass, constantly making sure that I know how intrinsically evil the catholic church is anytime I try to mention or educate him. How do I tell him that I have signed up for OCIA and I am seriously thinking about conversion? He thinks I am selling my salvation. 


Ill try to make this brief. I am 30F and live at home with my parents. I was raised Baptist/evangelical but in my late teen years I left the faith entirely and pursued new-age spirituality in defiance of my upbringing. I carried a lot of trauma from my early teen years that influenced my journey away from church and into the devil's pit. God never left me nor forsook me, and about 6 months ago I had a radical encounter with our Lord on my bedroom floor which completely turned my life around. At first, Dad was thrilled that his little girl had returned to the faith, I was so full of zeal and would spend hours having theological conversations with him over coffee. Amongst my new found love for Christ and the desire to know all His truths, His Holy Spirit led me to study catholicism. I thought I knew, as a cradle protestant, that catholicism was intrinsically evil, but my Spirit was curious about the faith and I begun to study all the teachings of the catholic church in an attempt to disprove it being the True Church. Safe to say, it had the opposite result and I have come to understand that I was fed so much misinformation about the church. I believe like 85% of what the church teaches, and can see how it is biblically based for the most part. The church fathers helped me immensely in areas that aren't so obviously mentioned in scripture. There are a few dogmas about mary that I am still getting my head around but I feel pretty confident in the churches authority that I know in time it will all make sense. 

I've been to mass a few times and absolutely love the reverence and devotion to Christ. I've been to a few other churches and always feel like something is missing. It's not quite right. At the catholic mass, I feel like im there the be in the presence of my Lord wheras at other churches it always feels like a social party with good music and not much else. Even the sermons felt off and I found myself disagreeing with a lot of the teachings. I really couldn't, in good faith, commit myself to a protestant church in light of what the Lord has revealed to me. 

I am so desperate to recieve the sacraments but I need to see out this journey of discerning into the church before I commit to anything yet. I've made a few rash decisions in my past that led me down some not very good roads, so I know that I have a tendency to follow my feelings without using logic. Im being very intentional about not repeating the same patterns in this instance. 

The biggest challenge that I am facing is not to do with the teachings of the church, but how my family are reacting to the idea that I am ""entering into heresy"". I have tried to explain in pieces the different misconceptions of the church but Dad specifically, seems more interested in mocking me than actually listening to what I have to say. It's difficult.

I have enquired about starting OCIA classes to further my studies, but how do I tell my Dad that I am seriously thinking about joining the catholic church or at least that I have signed up to classes? He thinks I am throwing away my salvation and I suspect that my decision will put up a barrier in our relationship. 

Also to add, I am very dependent on my parents as I have a physical disability hence why I live at home at age 30. I have my own unit on the property for independence but cant move out or away from because of my needs. ",7,1754211317.0,Catholicism,3,1.0,False

Hindi kasi ako mapakali sa mga narinig ko kanina sa isang expensive coffee shop in BGC. Nagulat and nandidiri lang ako na ganun pala mag-usap ang mga lalaki na rich oldies kapag sila sila lang magkakasama.

Earlier today, while enjoying my coffee and reading my book (and playing mobile games) this group of men arrived. They looked like 50s or late 50s. Their conversations were quite loud so it is impossible not to hear them. These boys, of course, may payabangan about cars and businesses.

Sabi nung isa, ""May Benz pala si so and so. Hindi ko alam. Akala ko so and so lang kotse niya"" 

""Si so and so ang tulis pa rin! Ang gaganda ng legs ng mga nakakasama niya. Impossibleng hindi niya natikman kahit isa don""

Then the other one said ""Pare ang ganda ng sasakyan mo. Dapat mejo bata bata kasama mo jan. Ang tanda na ng kasama mo hindi bagay sa kotse mo""

""Hindi maganda sa image kapag matandang babae na kasama mo. Mas nakakagwapo kapag bata pa""

Then ""Nakita niyo ba si (female name) piloto na! Nakita ko legs nun ang ganda!""

Then a conversation about someone's wife ""Yung asawa ni so and so bata pa. Nakita mo na legs nun?""

Mind you, yung iba don may asawa na kasi I overheard them talking to their wife kasi nagpapaalam na pupunta dun sa bahay ng kasama nila don. 

From the looks of it, they are not just ordinary people. May mga kaya sila because they have businesses, they have luxury cars na nakapark sa labas ng cafe, they know congressmen and mayors.  Sabi pa nga ng isa, client niya si Mayor so and so. They have businesses. Kaso bakit ganon? üòÖ So kapag tumanda na ang babae, disposable na (sa status level nila)? So kapag nag-40 na ang isang babae, nakakabawas ng pogi points nila yon? Kala mo naman ang ggwapo like the oldies but goodies na mga kilalang personalities.

1mgehfu,https://i.redd.it/hlyn9tydqrgf1.jpeg,Do my symptoms match what any of you experience?,"I'm ESPECIALLY curious about anyone with enlarged liver/spleen combo and urticaria reactions on elbows after drinking alcohol. It's SO WEIRD. 

-Enlarged liver and spleen in ultrasound for uknown reason. 
Tender, swollen, sore feeling in upper right quadrant of abdomen, but gallbladder is fine on ultrasound. 

-Chronic Anemia for over 10 years. Iron supplements do little to help.

-swollen lymph nodes on ultrasounds, especially in my armpits.

- Hives/Urticaria:

I can get hives anywhere at any time but they tend to always get worse as the day progresses and are worst in the evenings. Some nights I can't even sleep I am so itchy and benadryl does not help. If I scratch my skin when I have hives, my skin raises and the hobes get immediately worse and spread. However, when I don't have visible hives and I scratch my skin, then my skin does NOT raise or get red or rashy. 

My urticaria is more severe. I get it in the same 2 spots: my elbows and my right shoulder blade. These are more like thick itchy red welts that stay on my body for days/weeks/even months sometimes. No creams or OTC antihistamines help. The urticaria comes and goes and seems to time up with when my abdomen feels more swollen and sore. I feel like it's directly related to my liver/spleen.

-Really terrible face acne that has gotten worse as I've aged. In my 20s I had almost no acne. Now in my 40s I am covered in nonstop acne breakouts, especially around my mouth, chin, neck and chest.

Alcohol is 100% my biggest trigger. I have stopped drinking any alcohol. I was never a heavy drinker, usually juat a margarita or champage on special occasions. But for the past year, if I even have 1 glass, I will get the urticaria welts on my elbows for days or weeks.  Since I quit alcohol, I stopped getting elbow hives until THIS WEEK. They came back and so I for sure have other strong triggers. Other possible triggers I'm suspicious of are coffee, capsaicin and chocolate.

I have never had a serious allergy to anything where I immediately went into anaphalaxys or had any major swelling/rashes right after eating. The urticaria always seems to slowly develop about a day after I eat something triggering and it steadily grows worse over the next few days. 

Other symptoms when I feel like I'm flaring: severe anxiety, heart palpitations, raised blood pressure, migraines, tinnitus, occasional vertigo, intestinal distress, gerd, swollen throat, hoarse voice, joint pain, sore muscles, severe fatigue, weakness, dizziness, lightheaded when I bend forward, and brain fog, trouble finding words, blurry, misty vision especially at night. 

Diagnosed with Sjogrens last year and being treated for Lupus after ANA tests were positive and high,, however I do not get the typical lupus rash. I get urticaria that seems to be triggered by my digestive system. The Lupus medication has helped my joint pain but has done nothing for my hives/urticaria/liver/stomach problems. My rheumatologist even said my hives seem to be a separate issue and recommended an allergist. But should I go straight to one that treats MCAS? They are a much longer wait, but I don't want to waste money at an allergist that doesn't knows about MCAS.

Problems with BB since 20 y.o. I guess
really started affecting me at 25.

I knew it was not that great but eventually it became really bad. Very sulfur-ish and dead.

What I mean by affecting?
- Don't talk to people close by or turn your head when talking with them.
- Hold your hand in front off your mouth.
- Short sentences to minimize breath output.

This makes talking to people quite a hassle/hurdle and probably did not even help at all.

A white tongue, tonsil stones and the fact I could smell it myself sometimes were obviously not my biggest concern. Although I knew that these thing are probably the reasons why.

Stuff I tried (not chronically):
- See a doctor
(it will fix itself eventually)
- Gargling saltwater for some days
- Buying loads off mouth washes and rinses
(OxyFresh, The Breath Co and so on)
- Sinal drops
- Drinking more water
- Stop drinking dairy
- Stop drinking coffee 
- Scraping my tongue
- Removing all tonsil stones I could 
(Suction thing and waterfloss thing)
- Hydrogen Peroxide 3%

These things I tried span over multiple years.

My GF kindly reminds me that I smell sometimes and probably forgot to brush my teeth.
But I did brush my teeth (and rinsed tongue, flossed and use mouthwash)

1 or 2 weekse ago I was scrolling on Reddit once again to maybe find a cure.

I saw someone replying with.
Neem toothpaste and powder.

I dont know why I saw the comment but Neem (meaning 'take')  is a Dutch word (I'm Dutch) so I thought it read funky.

I decided too look into it.

After some investigating I order myself some stuff:
1x Neem Toothpaste
1x Neem Powder
1x Probiotics with BLIS K12 and M18. (Read this only aswell)
1x Coconut Oil

I let ChatGPT create me a routine and I asked what each step does.

The plan was:
Destroy bad Biofilm
Create new Biofilm

See below

---

ü¶∑ Morning Routine (before food or coffee)

Day 1 - 6: Active cleansing phase

1. ü•• Oil Pulling (only on Mon/Wed/Fri)

What to do: Swish 1 tsp coconut oil in your mouth for 3‚Äì5 minutes

Why: Pulls out fat-soluble bacteria, toxins, and softens old biofilm


2. üëÖ Tongue Scraping

What to do: Gently scrape your tongue 2‚Äì3 times with a scraper or spoon

Why: Physically removes loosened bacteria and biofilm from the tongue (biggest source of odor)


3. ü™• Brushing with Neem Toothpaste + Powder

What to do: Brush teeth and gums with neem toothpaste, then dip into neem powder and brush again

Why: Neem is anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and helps heal gums without killing all good bacteria


4. üíß Rinse with plain water

What to do: Just rinse your mouth with water

Why: Clears residue, avoids altering your pH (you‚Äôll stop saltwater from Day 8)



---

üåô Evening Routine (after your last meal)

Day 1‚Äì6: Active Cleanse Phase

1. üëÖ Tongue Scraping

‚Üí Removes bacteria that build up during the day

2. ü™• Brush with Neem

‚Üí Kills harmful bacteria, protects gums, maintains oral balance

3. üí® Rinse with diluted 3% Hydrogen Peroxide (1:1 water)

‚Üí Breaks down old biofilm and kills odor-causing anaerobic bacteria

4. üíß Rinse with water

‚Üí Removes any remaining peroxide to protect tissues


---

Day 7: Transition Day

Same steps, but no peroxide

Use plain water or saltwater instead

Prepares your mouth for new healthy bacteria



---

From Day 8: Build-Up Phase (Probiotics)

1. üëÖ Tongue Scraping

‚Üí Keeps surface clean for probiotics to settle

2. ü™• Brush with Neem

‚Üí Supports healthy mouth without harming good bacteria

3. üíä Take 1 NatureWise Probiotic Tablet

‚Üí Chew or let dissolve slowly
‚Üí Do not eat or drink for 30 minutes afterward
‚Üí Allows BLIS K12/M18 to colonize your mouth and throat

‚Äê-‚Äê----

I'm now on day 4.
The oil pulling is the only part that I'm not the biggest fan off but hey no pain no gain. The rest is fine. The toothpaste is great.

My tongue stopped being white on day 1 or 2 already so that was nice.

Have also not noticed any bad breath since day 1 or 2.

Before I licked my arm and smelled it. And it was gross. But now. Nothing. Just normal I guess.

I still got some days to go but I'm baffled by the quickness off the treatment. Also quite cheap compared to all the costs of mouthwash.

Hopefully in the end my tongue has a better collection of bacteria and what not and I can live on without the constant worrying / shame / fear.

I remember inquiring to a Cebu-based travel organizer while waiting for my flight to Cebu, and eventually considered hiking on the weekend.

We started on our ascent to Mt. Mauyog at around 7:00am after our group warmed up. The first parts of the trail were steep and narrow, with some parts requiring upper-body strength due to rock climbing. As our group went along, I suddenlt felt palpitations, probably due to the coffee I drank. We finally reached the summit after almost an hour, with the clearing and the epic brain rock formation greeting us. Apparently, its name means ""shaky"" or ""maalog"" in Cebuano, since the rock formations shake and wobble when someone steps onto those.

Apart from the trail being a bit challenging, I also thought joining in this trip a challenge on its own since I am the only one who doesn't entirely speak Cebuano (gamay ra kong kasabot na Bisaya), but I am glad that the organizers and my fellow joiners are friendly and helpful and, at times, translate their conversations everytime they see me cluelessly staring like I cannot comprehend their words.

Mt. Manunggal, on the other part, was known to be the site of crash of the plane ""Mt. Pinatubo"" which carried the former president Ramon Magsaysay. Standing with an elevation of 1003 MASLA, it is considered the third highest peak in Cebu. Right before noontime, we set foot onto the summit, and saw another rock formations and the scenic view of the Balamban town.

**Ellis Park, Race 1, Optional Claiming, 1430y, Dirt, Fast**

**Preview**

Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 1 over 1430m on a fast dirt track shapes as a competitive optional claiming event for fillies and mares. The race setup favors horses with tactical speed, given the true rail position and fast conditions, which should produce an even pace. Arrasou (3) is likely to lead from barrier 3, setting a moderate tempo, with Greek Heiress (2) and Adiva (1) stalking close behind. Punchy Girl (5) and De‚Äô Ans Eighty (6) will settle midfield, looking to capitalize on their strong finishing sectionals, while Demi (8) and Tiffany Twist (4) will need luck from wider draws to unleash their late runs. The 1430m distance tests stamina, favoring horses with proven form at 1308m or beyond, such as Greek Heiress and Punchy Girl, while Adiva‚Äôs pedigree suggests she can handle the trip despite limited exposure.

Punchy Girl stands out with her recent 1308m win at Churchill Downs and strong course/distance record (1-1-4). Her ability to settle midfield and finish strongly (L500m: 31.64) suits this setup, and the Keith Asmussen/R L Morse combo (30% win rate) adds confidence. De‚Äô Ans Eighty is a major threat, with a dominant 1106m win and consistent placings at 1207m-1308m. Her trainer Robertino Diodoro (18% win, 60% place) is a master at placing horses, and her sectionals (L800m: 47.88) indicate she‚Äôll be strong late. Greek Heiress has the best course/distance record (2-0-2) and loves fast conditions, with her 1308m form (1:16.63) suggesting she‚Äôs suited to 1430m. Adiva‚Äôs inside draw and consistency (6-12-30) make her a safe bet, though the distance is a slight query. Demi‚Äôs closing speed is dangerous, but barrier 8 is a challenge, while Tiffany Twist‚Äôs course form is offset by recent inconsistency. Arrasou‚Äôs front-running style could see her lead early, but the class step-up and untested distance are concerns. Angel Kiss looks outclassed based on recent form.

The race hinges on pace dynamics and stamina, with Punchy Girl, De‚Äô Ans Eighty, and Greek Heiress best placed to capitalize.

**Top Predicted Contenders**

* **Punchy Girl**: Strong 1308m win, excellent course/distance form, and top jockey/trainer combo.
* **De‚Äô Ans Eighty**: Dominant recent form, elite trainer, and strong sectionals for 1430m.
* **Greek Heiress**: Proven at course/distance, loves fast tracks, and has tactical speed.
* **Adiva**: Consistent, benefits from barrier 1, and pedigree supports distance.
* **Demi**: Dangerous closer, but wide draw is a concern.

**Preview**: Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 2, a 1540y Maiden Optional Claiming for 2yo fillies on a fast dirt surface, shapes as a fascinating contest with a mix of lightly raced runners and debutants. The rail is true, and the pace should be moderate, led by Nanzig and Cup of Coffee, with High Dollar Dolly and Riekes settling just behind. The longer 1540m trip favors horses with stamina-oriented pedigrees, and several runners show promise based on breeding and connections. Nanzig brings the strongest exposed form, with consistent placings in four starts, including a 3rd at Horseshoe Indianapolis (1006m) 29 days ago. Her early speed ensures she‚Äôll lead, but the 1540m distance is a query given her sprint-oriented pedigree. Authentic Angel, with a solid 3rd at 1509m on turf, has the best proven form at longer distances and should relish the step-up on dirt. Her closing style suits the expected pace. Riekes, a debutant trained by Joe Sharp and ridden by Tyler Gaffalione, looms as a major threat based on her Speightstown-Medaglia d‚ÄôOro pedigree, which screams middle-distance potential. Sharp‚Äôs 20% strike rate with first-starters adds confidence. Don‚Äôtmindifido, another debutant, benefits from Mark E Casse‚Äôs strong record with 2yos and a Runhappy-Bernardini pedigree suited to this trip. Sticker Shocked, trained by Kenneth G McPeek, has a versatile Audible pedigree and elite jockey Brian Joseph Hernandez Jr, making her a serious debut contender. High Dollar Dolly, despite a moderate debut, should improve at 1540m with her Runhappy pedigree and Joe Sharp‚Äôs training. The race hinges on whether experienced runners like Nanzig and Authentic Angel can hold off the debutants, who have significant scope. Barrier draws and pace dynamics will play a key role, with inside gates favoring High Dollar Dolly and Riekes, while wide draws challenge Sticker Shocked and By My Dreams.

**Top Predicted Contenders**:

* **RIEKES**: Elite connections (Sharp/Gaffalione) and a pedigree (Speightstown-Medaglia d‚ÄôOro) perfectly suited to 1540m. Strong debut chance.
* **DON‚ÄôTMINDIFIDO**: Mark E Casse‚Äôs 2yo expertise and a stamina-oriented Runhappy-Bernardini pedigree make her a major threat on debut.
* **AUTHENTIC ANGEL**: Proven at 1509m with a solid 3rd, her pedigree and closing style suit this trip. Best exposed form over distance.
* **NANZIG**: Consistent form (two 3rds in four starts) and early speed ensure she‚Äôll be prominent, though 1540m is a query.
* **STICKER SHOCKED**: McPeek and Hernandez are a potent combo, and her Audible pedigree suggests versatility. Wide draw is a concern.
* **HIGH DOLLAR DOLLY**: Moderate debut but should improve at 1540m with Sharp‚Äôs training and a good draw.



# Ellis Park Race 3



**Ellis Park, Race 3, Claiming, 3yo and up, 1320y (Dirt), Fast**

**Preview**:

Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 3, a 1320y Claiming event for 3yo and up on a fast dirt surface, promises a competitive clash with a mix of proven performers and improving types. The pace should be moderate, with Guardian (1), Lambo (9), and Illini (6) likely to vie for the lead, while Forty Love (2), Morunning (5), and Trouble‚Äôs Roaring (10) can stalk effectively. The rail is true, so no significant bias is expected, but inside barriers may hold an edge early. Lambo stands out with a strong maiden win (1207m, Churchill, 3.75L) and a solid 3rd in a starter allowance, backed by the in-form David Jacobson and Tyler Gaffalione, who boast a 40% win rate together. His ability to race on-pace and sustain speed (L800m 47.36s) makes him suited to the 1320m. Forty Love is a major threat, with consistent form (1st, 3rd, 4th in recent runs) and strong closing sectionals (L500m 30.44s). His barrier 2 draw and Peter Eurton‚Äôs 54% place rate add to his appeal. Illini‚Äôs near-miss 2nd (1207m, Churchill) and excellent Ellis Park record (1-1-3) make him a contender, especially if he can control the pace from barrier 6. Trouble‚Äôs Roaring, trained by Steven Asmussen, has a recent maiden win and a strong track record (1-6-8), while Putting Eagle‚Äôs consistency (1-3-10 at Ellis) and Morunning‚Äôs solid form (3rd at 1207m) round out the key chances. The race hinges on pace management, with Lambo and Forty Love best placed to capitalize.

**Top Predicted Contenders**:

* **Lambo**: Strong maiden win, recent 3rd, and elite jockey/trainer combo. Suited to 1320m with on-pace style.
* **Forty Love**: Consistent form, strong sectionals, and ideal draw. Likely to finish strongly.
* **Illini**: Excellent track record and near-miss last start. Can lead or sit close.
* **Trouble‚Äôs Roaring**: Recent maiden win and strong Ellis Park record. Versatile and in form.
* **Putting Eagle**: Consistent at track and distance, with a good draw. Can run on.
* **Morunning**: Solid form and suited to 1320m, but Ellis Park record is a slight concern.



# Ellis Park Race 4



**Ellis Park, Race 4, Maiden Special Weight, 2yo Fillies, 1870y, Turf, Firm**

**Preview**

This 2yo fillies‚Äô Maiden Special Weight over 1870m on firm turf at Ellis Park shapes as a fascinating contest, with a mix of lightly raced runners and debutants. The race setup suggests a moderate pace, with horses like Soloist (barrier 1), Spicy Princess (2), and Nonconsecutivetrms (3) likely to be prominent early, while wider-drawn runners may need to work harder to find a position. The firm turf and true rail position should ensure a fair track, favoring horses with stamina and tactical speed.

Nonconsecutivetrms stands out as the horse to beat, having run a strong 2nd at this track and distance (1609m) 29 days ago behind Loveliest, beating Spicy Princess (3rd) and Hollybygolly (8th). Her form is the best exposed, and second-up, she should be at her peak under Brendan Walsh‚Äôs training. Her pedigree by Not This Time and American Pharoah suggests she‚Äôll handle the step to 1870m, though jockey Danny Sheehy‚Äôs modest strike rate is a slight concern. Spicy Princess is the other key form runner, with a 3rd in the same race. Third-up, she‚Äôs fitter and drawn well in barrier 2, but she needs to find a length or two to challenge Nonconsecutivetrms. Her Tapit pedigree supports the distance, but Keith Asmussen‚Äôs 6% win rate tempers expectations.

Among the debutants, Soloist looks the most promising. Trained by Kenny McPeek and ridden by Brian Hernandez Jr, she boasts a pedigree by Into Mischief and Daddys Lil Darling that‚Äôs tailor-made for this trip and surface. Barrier 1 gives her a tactical edge, and McPeek‚Äôs debutant record is strong. Infinite Sky (Brad Cox) and Ontology (Brendan Walsh) are other first-starters to respect, with pedigrees suited to 1870m and top trainers, though their wide draws (10 and 11) are challenges. Love a Little Mo could improve sharply second-up, with her Uncle Mo pedigree screaming turf and distance suitability, but her debut form on dirt was only fair.

The race hinges on whether the exposed form of Nonconsecutivetrms and Spicy Princess holds up against the potential of well-bred debutants like Soloist and Infinite Sky. Pace dynamics favor those near the front, and the firm turf should suit most runners. Nonconsecutivetrms is the one to beat, but Soloist‚Äôs pedigree and draw make her a serious threat.

**Top Predicted Contenders**

* Nonconsecutivetrms: Strong 2nd at this track/distance, proven form, peaking second-up.
* Soloist: Top pedigree, ideal draw, strong trainer-jockey combo for debut.
* Spicy Princess: Consistent form, third-up, well-drawn, suited to distance.
* Infinite Sky: Elite trainer, strong pedigree, but wide draw a concern.



# Ellis Park Race 5



**Ellis Park, Race 5, 2yo Fillies Maiden Special Weight, 1320y, Dirt, Fast**

**Preview**

Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 5 is a competitive 2yo fillies‚Äô Maiden Special Weight over 6 furlongs on a fast dirt track, with a $100,000 purse attracting a deep field of 15 runners. The race setup suggests a moderate pace, with horses like Queen Juno, Joke Maker, and Glam Slam likely to vie for the lead or sit handy. The inside barriers (1-5) hold a tactical advantage, allowing runners to save ground on the rail, while wider-drawn horses (10-15) face challenges in a field this size. The key contenders emerge from a mix of debutants with strong pedigrees and trainers, and runners with exposed form showing promise.

**Queen Juno** stands out with her recent 2nd at this track and distance, where she led on the turn before being outfinished by 2.5L. Her experience at Ellis Park, combined with Mark Casse‚Äôs training and a favorable barrier 4, makes her a benchmark. **Joke Maker** is another major player, having run a strong 2nd at Horseshoe Indianapolis over 5f, closing well despite a wide run. The step to 6f suits her Practical Joke pedigree, and Rodolphe Brisset‚Äôs elite jockey-trainer combo (23% win rate) adds confidence. **Glam Slam**, a debutant from barrier 1, benefits from John Servis‚Äôs strong first-up record and a McKinzie pedigree tailored for this trip. **On Time Girl** is a dangerous debutant, trained by Brad Cox (28% win rate), with a Not This Time pedigree screaming speed. **Click** and **Bourbon Notes** round out the chances, with strong trainers (Calhoun, Wilkes) and sprinting pedigrees, though their wider draws (6, 10) are minor concerns.

The race dynamics favor horses who can settle forward or midfield, as the 6f trip and fast dirt reward speed and stamina. Wider-drawn runners like Practically Famous, Corbet‚Äôs Crush, and Sway House face tough tasks, needing luck to overcome their barriers. The top four‚ÄîQueen Juno, Joke Maker, Glam Slam, and On Time Girl‚Äîshould dominate, with their form, pedigrees, and connections giving them the edge in a race where experience and tactical position will be key.

**Top Predicted Contenders**

* **Queen Juno**: Recent 2nd at this track/distance, strong speed, ideal draw (4), and Casse‚Äôs training.
* **Joke Maker**: Solid 2nd at 5f, closing sectionals, Practical Joke pedigree for 6f, elite jockey-trainer combo.
* **Glam Slam**: Debutant with McKinzie pedigree, rail draw, and Servis‚Äôs strong first-up record.
* **On Time Girl**: Cox‚Äôs 28% win rate, Not This Time pedigree, and barrier 5 make her a big threat.
* **Click**: Calhoun‚Äôs 30% win rate, Connect pedigree, but barrier 6 slightly lowers chances.
* **Bourbon Notes**: Charlatan pedigree, Wilkes‚Äôs solid prep, but barrier 10 is a challenge.



# Ellis Park Race 6



**Ellis Park, Race 6, Alw Opt Clm, 3yo and up, Fillies & Mares, 1320y, Dirt, Fast**

**Preview**: Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 6 is a competitive Allowance Optional Claiming event for fillies and mares over 1320y on a fast dirt surface, with a true rail ensuring no significant track bias. The field of 11 is deep, with several horses boasting strong form and track records at Ellis Park. The projected pace is likely to be strong, with Girls Weekend and Miss Arlington vying for the lead, setting up a race that favors closers or those who can sit just off the speed. Tripolina stands out as a top contender, with her consistent form in Listed and Allowance races, including a near-miss in the Roxelana S. (1207m, 0.5L) and a strong 2nd at 1509m. Her low barrier (1) and ability to stalk the pace make her ideally suited, and trainer Chris Hartman‚Äôs horses often peak second-up. Stilettos is another major player, with a recent 2nd at Ellis Park (1308m, 0.5L) and a Listed win (1408m). Her closing speed and elite trainer/jockey combo (Calhoun/Hernandez Jr) make her dangerous, despite a wide barrier (11). Mila Rose, a lightly raced 3yo trained by Steven Asmussen, has scope for improvement and a strong track record (2 wins from 3 at Ellis Park). Her recent wins at 1207m show class, but her wide barrier (8) is a challenge. Reagan‚Äôs Flame has a strong Ellis Park record (3 wins from 5) and suits the distance, but her last start was poor, and barrier 10 is a concern. Hillerito brings speed from barrier 2 but faces a class rise, while Catchyalater has recent maiden form but needs to overcome a wide barrier (9). Girls Weekend and Miss Arlington could pressure the pace but may fade late. The race dynamics favor a horse with tactical speed or a strong finish, making Tripolina and Stilettos the ones to beat, with Mila Rose and Reagan‚Äôs Flame as value contenders.

**Top Predicted Contenders**:

* **TRIPOLINA**: Consistent form, ideal barrier, strong recent runs in Listed/Alw Opt Clm, suits distance and track.
* **STILETTOS**: Recent 2nd at Ellis Park, Listed winner, elite trainer/jockey, closing speed suits fast pace.
* **MILA ROSE**: Lightly raced 3yo, two Ellis Park wins, Asmussen‚Äôs training, scope to improve.
* **REAGAN‚ÄôS FLAME**: Strong Ellis Park record, suits distance, but wide barrier and last start are concerns.
* **GIRLS WEEKEND**: Front-running style, track win, but recent form and head-to-head losses temper expectations.
* **CATCHYALATER**: Recent maiden win, closing speed, but wide barrier and class rise are challenges.



# Ellis Park Race 7



**Ellis Park, Race 7, Nongraded Stake/Handicap, 2200y Turf, 3yo and up, 55.5kg**

**Preview**

This 2200m turf handicap at Ellis Park promises a competitive clash, with several runners boasting strong credentials at this distance and class. The firm track and true rail position suggest a fair race, with pace likely to be moderate, favoring horses with tactical speed or strong closing ability. Highway Robber stands out as the horse to beat, given his exceptional form, including a G3 win at 2414m and a recent 2nd in the Listed Chorleywood S. (2213m) at Churchill Downs, where he beat several of today‚Äôs rivals. His versatility, proven track record at Ellis Park (2-1-3), and suitability to firm turf make him the benchmark. Anglophile is a major threat, with G2 placings at 2213m-2414m and a closing style that could capitalize on a fast pace. His 3rd in the G2 Visitlex Elkhorn S. and 2nd in the G2 Man O‚Äô War S. highlight his class, though he needs to overcome a moderate Ellis Park record. Verstappen‚Äôs Listed win at 2414m and 3rd in the Chorleywood S. make him a consistent contender, particularly with his forward-running style from barrier 2. Sugoi, a Listed winner at 2414m, is dangerous if he can replicate his Connally Turf Cup performance, though his recent 8th in the Chorleywood S. tempers expectations. Dashman‚Äôs G3 win at 2414m is notable, but a 190-day layoff raises fitness concerns. Ole Crazy Bone and Clyde‚Äôs Got A Gun are honest but likely placegetters at best, with the former‚Äôs Connally Turf Cup 3rd a highlight. Multitask and Quatrocento face significant class and distance queries, while Tapit Shoes‚Äô recent Allowance win is promising but lacks stakes depth. The race shape favors Highway Robber‚Äôs ability to settle midfield and close strongly, with Anglophile and Verstappen likely to challenge late.

**Top Predicted Contenders**

* **Highway Robber**: G3 win, G1/G2 placings, loves Ellis Park, and suited to 2200m.
* **Anglophile**: G2 placings, strong closing speed, and suited to distance.
* **Verstappen**: Listed winner, consistent form, and forward-running style from barrier 2.
* **Sugoi**: Listed winner at 2414m, but recent form is mixed.
* **Dashman**: G3 winner, but long layoff is a concern.
* **Ole Crazy Bone**: Solid Allowance form and Listed placing, but struggles at higher levels.



# Ellis Park Race 8



**Venue, Race No, Race Details**: Ellis Park, Race 8, Nongraded Stake/Handicap, 1760y Turf, 3yo and up FM, Firm

**Preview**:

Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 8, a $250,000 non-graded stake/handicap over 1760y on firm turf, shapes as a competitive affair with several horses bringing strong credentials. SIMPLY IN FRONT stands out as the class runner, boasting two G2 wins (1308m and 1609m) and a respectable 5th in a G1 last start. Her versatility, strong closing speed (L800m 47.35s in her G2 win), and ideal barrier 1 make her the horse to beat. She‚Äôs proven at this level, and her ability to settle forward or midfield suits the expected moderate pace. PHAROAH‚ÄôS WINE is in career-best form, with two consecutive allowance wins at Churchill Downs (1609m), including a victory over SUMMERINTAHOE and SHE‚ÄôS LOOKIN LUCKY. Her closing ability (L800m 46.92s) and suitability to firm turf make her a major threat, though barrier 6 requires a smart ride. WAVES OF MISCHIEF, a G3 winner at this track (1811m), is a tough front-runner who can control the race from barrier 3. Her forward-running style and proven form at Ellis Park make her a strong contender, though she may need to improve to match SIMPLY IN FRONT‚Äôs class. SUMMERINTAHOE is a consistent front-runner with a recent 2nd at this track (1609m), but her lack of stakes experience is a query against this field. AUSTERE brings consistent stakes form (G3 2nd, Listed 3rd), and her closing speed suits, but barrier 7 may force her to work harder. SHE‚ÄôS LOOKIN LUCKY is another consistent type with a Listed 3rd and G3 2nd, but barrier 9 and a slight class gap make her a place hope. IRISH MAXIMA is a dominant dirt sprinter but unproven on turf and at 1760m, while AMBER CASCADE and SANCTIFY face class and consistency challenges, respectively. The race should see IRISH MAXIMA and SUMMERINTAHOE set a moderate pace, with SIMPLY IN FRONT and PHAROAH‚ÄôS WINE poised to strike late. The firm track and true rail favor horses with strong finishing bursts, giving SIMPLY IN FRONT and PHAROAH‚ÄôS WINE the edge.

**Top Predicted Contenders**:

* **SIMPLY IN FRONT**: Class edge with G2 wins, ideal barrier, and strong closing speed.
* **PHAROAH‚ÄôS WINE**: In top form with two allowance wins, loves firm turf, and has a potent finish.
* **WAVES OF MISCHIEF**: G3 winner at this track, forward-running style suits, and barrier 3 is perfect.
* **AUSTERE**: Consistent in stakes races, strong trainer-jockey combo, and good closing speed.
* **SHE‚ÄôS LOOKIN LUCKY**: Reliable form with recent Listed 3rd, but barrier 9 is a concern.
* **SUMMERINTAHOE**: Front-runner with track affinity, but stakes class is a query.



# Ellis Park Race 9



**Ellis Park, Race 9, Grade III Stakes/Handicap, 1980y Turf, 3yo Fillies, 53.5kg, Firm**

**Preview**

Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 9, a Grade III Stakes/Handicap over 1980m on firm turf for 3yo fillies, promises a competitive clash with a mix of proven stakes performers and improving types. The true rail and firm track should produce even-paced racing, favoring horses with strong closing speed or tactical versatility. The 1980m distance is a step up for most, making stamina and pedigree critical, while the moderate pace projected from the speed map suggests closers will have their chance if the leaders overcommit early.

**Destino D‚Äôoro** stands out as a top contender. Her Allowance win (1710m, Turf) at Churchill Downs was impressive, and her near-miss 3rd (0.1L) in the G2 Jessamine S. confirms her class. Trained by Brad Cox, whose 28% strike rate inspires confidence, and with a pedigree suited to 1980m, she‚Äôs well-placed from barrier 3 to sit midfield and unleash her strong closing kick (L500m: 30.26). Her ability to close from the back in a fast-paced race makes her a major threat.

**Admit** is another serious player. Her recent Allowance win (1609m, Turf) over Just Ruthless was strong, and her Listed race placings (2nd and 3rd) show she can handle stakes company. Thomas Drury‚Äôs 22% strike rate and Brian Hernandez‚Äôs experience add weight, though barrier 8 requires a smart ride to avoid being caught wide. Her pedigree (Blame x War Front) is perfect for the distance, and her sectional times suggest she can finish strongly.

**Hereforagoodtime** brings G3 form with a 3rd (1.5L) in the Regret S. (1811m, Turf) and a dominant Allowance win (1710m, Turf). Brendan Walsh and Tyler Gaffalione form a potent combination, but barrier 10 is a challenge. Her pedigree (Justify x Speightstown) and closing speed (L500m: 29.6) make her a danger if she overcomes the draw. **Drop The Hammer** is in peak form after a 2.25L win at Ellis Park (1710m, Turf), with her sectional (L500m: 29.62) indicating she can handle the step up. Barrier 2 and her win over Princess Attitude give her an edge.

**Princess Attitude** and **Deloraine** are consistent placegetters in stakes races, with Princess Attitude‚Äôs Frankel pedigree suggesting she‚Äôll relish 1980m. Both lack the class of the top trio but could sneak a placing. **Liam In The Dust** has a recent win but is unproven on turf, while **Just Ruthless** and **Nosleeptilbrooklyn** need to improve to match this field. **Fixin To Bee** has distance suitability but lacks the class to win.

The race hinges on pace and positioning, with Destino D‚Äôoro and Admit likely to benefit from a steady tempo, while Hereforagoodtime‚Äôs closing speed could be decisive if the leaders fade.

**Top Predicted Contenders**

* **Destino D‚Äôoro** ‚Äì Elite trainer, strong turf form, ideal pedigree, and closing speed.
* **Admit** ‚Äì Recent Allowance win, stakes placings, and suited to 1980m.
* **Hereforagoodtime** ‚Äì G3 form, strong closing sectionals, but wide draw a concern.
* **Drop The Hammer** ‚Äì Recent Ellis Park win, good draw, and turf affinity.
* **Princess Attitude** ‚Äì Consistent stakes form and distance-suited pedigree.
* **Deloraine** ‚Äì Reliable in stakes races but needs to find more to win.



# Ellis Park Race 10



**Ellis Park, Race 10, Nongraded Stake/Handicap, 3yo and up, 1210y (Turf)**

**Preview**:

Ellis Park‚Äôs Race 10, a 1210y non-graded stakes on firm turf, shapes as a fascinating contest with a mix of proven stakes performers and emerging talents. Coppola stands out as the horse to beat, coming off a dominant win in the William Garrett H. (1006m, LR) at Horseshoe Indianapolis, where he beat Charcoal and Bear River convincingly. His ability to lead from barrier 1, combined with his strong form against Arzak and Nobals in prior clashes, makes him the benchmark. His Into Mischief pedigree and peak fitness suggest he‚Äôll dictate terms and be hard to run down. Joe Shiesty is a major threat, fresh off a stakes win in the Mighty Beau S. (1006m, LR) and boasting a head-to-head edge over Coppola. His tactical versatility from barrier 3 and synergy with jockey Luan Machado make him a genuine contender. Nobals, with his G2 win at Woodbine and Allowance victory over Chiseler, brings elite credentials. His closing speed from barrier 7 suits a fast pace, which Coppola is likely to set. Arzak, despite a wide draw (barrier 10), is a danger with his consistent stakes form, including a close 2nd to Coppola in the Janus S. His closing sectionals and head-to-head wins over Coppola give him a shot. Charcoal, a track specialist with a win at Ellis Park last year, is a strong each-way chance from barrier 11, especially if he can repeat his Woodford S. 2nd. Chiseler rounds out the top contenders, with his Keeneland Allowance win and track suitability making him a place hope. The race setup favors front-runners, with Coppola likely to lead and Joe Shiesty stalking. A moderate to fast pace should suit closers like Nobals, Arzak, and Charcoal, but the firm turf and true rail position ensure a fair contest. The key will be whether Coppola can hold off the late chargers or if Joe Shiesty‚Äôs versatility proves decisive.

**Top Predicted Contenders**:

* **Coppola**: Dominant recent stakes win, ideal barrier, and pace control make him the horse to beat.
* **Joe Shiesty**: Recent stakes win, head-to-head edge over Coppola, and tactical speed from barrier 3.
* **Nobals**: Elite stakes form, strong closing speed, and proven at this level.
* **Arzak**: Consistent stakes performer with closing speed, despite a wide draw.
* **Charcoal**: Track specialist with strong recent form, suited by fast pace.
* **Chiseler**: Solid Allowance form and track suitability, but a tier below the best.

1mge7f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wacken/comments/1mge7f2/well_fuck_you_wacken_with_a_capital_f/,"Well, Fuck you Wacken, with a capital F","I realise that a lot have been said already about the mud at Wacken 2025, but as the organizers are hiding behind the ‚ÄúRain or shine‚Äù bullshit, censoring of their social media from all critics, and an army of fanboys who would lick their boots full of cow shit, I feel the urge to share our experience in the hope that it may help people to get trapped in that money scheme. And before I start, I insist on the fact that those organizers are not only crooks, they put the live and health of metal fans at risk, and I‚Äôm not a pussy about it, I can testify to 1 life critical situation and 1 serious injury. I hope they get sued and if class action is a thing, I hope they get one deep in the ass.

So, here we go, first Wacken and it all started great. We decided to come, after almost 15 years of various festivals and mainly Hellfest, that we saw growing and losing its soul little by little in favor of money. So we are on a quest for a more auspicious metal fest, and we thought : ‚Äúwell, what about Wacken and its holy ground?‚Äù. We tagged along a groupe of around 30 fest friends we met along the years and off we fuck to Wacken.¬†

Saturday evening we arrived, Sunday morning we were on site and the camp was set up. And man, did it look great promising ! I can‚Äôt explain the feel of freedom better than the smell of fresh coffee, bacon and eggs on a metal fest morning. Being able to camp next to your tent AND have a stove and BBQ AND have a generator is a real game changer for a fest.¬†

It was raining, a bit muddy, but whatever, we fucked off to the fest shop to have a look around and we felt like kids in a toy shop. The market is huge, there is fresh food available, the Wasteland looks great, already we see a lot of animation 3 days before the actual beginning. Fuck yeah, it looks great, rain or shine baby, we are not gonna shy for some rain and some mud, we are waterproofed any way !

Ah !

3 days of shitty rain later, the whole area has been turned into a huge fucking pool of mud. I mean mud, let‚Äôs remember this is a cow field most of the year, so mud and shit really. And if you were to doubt it, well, the smell would be a great reminder.¬†

And when I say a pool, I mean AT BEST ankle deep. The stew is liquid in some parts and there is nowhere to go. Despite the smell and the health hazard that should be obvious in the 21th century, the logistic of it is fucking awful.¬†

Every step you take is an effort, and the field is huge. If you, like us, like to enjoy a festival to go on a discovery rampage and surf crowd from show to show, you can just forget about it.¬†

A distance you could usually walk in less than 5 minutes will take you 30 or more, and you will arrive soaked and exhausted. We usually see around 10 shows a day, our max was 5‚Ä¶

And once you are there, you just stand still in another fucking pool of liquid dirt sprinkled with cow shit and whatever stuff the other thousands of trapped souls have left fall in that puddle.¬†

And guess what REALLY hates standing in cow shit all day long ? Your feet.

I have seen the comments here and there : ‚Äúyou just need to have basic hygiene‚Äù, ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôve been going for X years and never had an issue‚Äù, ‚Äúme and my pals are fine, you‚Äôre just a pussy‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear white sneakers‚Äù. 

BULSHIT.

Because, yes, we WERE rain proofed, I am quite used to both muddy festivals AND outdoor and bushcraft, I know my way around, but I didn‚Äôt expect that level of stupidity from the organizers. Rain proofed is not 30 cm deep in cow shit proofed.

And you can clean yourself thoroughly before leaving to that hellpit of a festival, and thoroughly when you come back, you still spend 12 hours standing in shit and your skin will not forgive you.¬†

In other words, be prepared for a fungi attack and various kind of infection.

By the way, let‚Äôs not forget that you are standing in shit AND eating in shit. On that front I will not go into a rant about the food price (insane) as you can totally bring your own food and fridge and escape that part of the trap (and we did).¬†

However, even with water, soap and common sense, you are still living in cow shit and you are hence liable for all kind of nice bacterias to colonize your gut. Also, fun fact, you will discover at one point that they put the drinking water robinet next to the not drinkable, and most of them DON‚ÄôT HAVE A FUCKING SIGN. Mother fuckers, I hope their guts rot in hell.

So, yeah, a fucking nightmare.¬†

What took me sometime to realize though, is that not only you could get sick, but you could really lose a fucking limb or die in that shit of a shit show.¬†

Soon after we arrived, when the field was still walkable, we had a guy having a heart attack in front of our tent. Fortunately one of us knows CPR and was able to help him until the help arrived.¬†

Now, it took us some thinking about it, as this had kind of a happy ending (the guy left with vitals).

What if it had happened 2 days later ? Our friends would have taken at least 5 minutes to reach him, and what when he does ? Would an ambulance be able to drive that mud ? Did you have a look of what the ‚Äúemergency‚Äù pathways looked ? No way. One of the small rover could have, and they would have done shit.

They would have been able to bring back a corpse to the ambulance stuck in the mud.

In the second situation, we discussed with another French guy we met on Saturday, his wife broke her leg in the mud. And I mean broke, broke, like several pieces, go to surgery and don‚Äôt live before a week broke. Because of the fucking mud.

The worst part is that this situation is not uncommon to the organiser, they have prior experience, and just so we are on the same page, they will become the norm thanks to climate change. This is a known fact, the southern of Europe is drying and the water evaporating is falling back on Wacken (and allegedly the rest of northern Europe).¬†

This is a fact, period.

And the organizers are answering the situation with a sprinkling of wood chips here and there, one or two pumps, and some more ‚ÄúRain or Shine‚Äù bullshit.

Fuck that, fuck them.

Don‚Äôt give me that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a cow field‚Äù excuse neither, because it sure is horse shit too. The solution does exist, and in 35 years of experience, they had plenty of opportunity to invest in it, especially with that sweet yankee investors money.¬†

It‚Äôs called agricultural drainage. And I don‚Äôt mean the fucking joke of a ditch they sprinkled here and there, most of them FUCKING UPHILL, the mother fuckers are defying gravity too !

I mean a real drainage system, underground pipes, concrete canals secured with grates, the real thing.

Yes, it cost money, but that fest is dying. Two extreme mud events with no preparation whatsoever in 3 years ? yeah, they will lose much more for being cheap bastards.¬†

So, yeah.¬†

That festival should have been CANCELED and is, really, nothing more than another cashgrab at the metal community, and you have a great reminder of this at every mainstages show in the form of advertising for their ‚Äúmetal holidays‚Äù on a fucking cruise boat (but, hey, wacken is solar powered, this is fine).

The hell if I‚Äôll trust those motherfuckers to manage a boat when they can‚Äôt manage a fucking field.

Sue their ass guys, they deserve it.

On another topic, the quest for a new metal fest continues (with bbq, cars and stove allowed, we are not coming back from that!)

who laughs a little louder,
forgets to double-think
before she speaks,
who sings in public,
and doesn‚Äôt shrink
when eyes land on her like weight.

There‚Äôs a version of me
who didn‚Äôt love you
so hard she forgot herself.
She didn‚Äôt make silence
her second skin,
or mistake apologies
for affection.

There‚Äôs a version of me
who walks away
at the first red flag,
not after painting it
every shade of hope.
She doesn‚Äôt stay
just because leaving hurts.

There‚Äôs a version of me
who isn't afraid
to be alone.
She pours coffee for one
and still smiles,
because her love
doesn't need an echo
to be real.

But none of those versions
met you.
And maybe that‚Äôs the lesson:
I gave you the girl
who needed saving 
not the one
who learned to fly.

1mge644,https://www.reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/1mge644/the_best_advice_you_can_receive_when_nothing_is/,The best advice you can receive when NOTHING is in your control:,"Hi all! First time posting but I've been lurking all 35 days we've been here. I want to start off by saying this subreddit saved me more times than I can count during this stay. All of you mama and papa's are incredible and I'm so thankful to all of you for the advice you've given even if you didn't know you were giving it. Our baby was born at 34 weeks so we've had it easy compared to very very many of you on here. Though I learned very quickly that the comparison game is
bullshit and shit for you. But anyway. This advice that I received was from the amazing psychologist that came with our little NICU stay, when he saw me beginning to unravel on day 7. I was sweating and running around cleaning, reorganizing and sanitizing the NICU baby room for the 8,000th time that hour and he asked me why I was doing it. And I broke down and said ""because NOTHING is in my control. And im not even a control freak but I can't hold my baby, I can't feed her, I can't bathe her, I can't even really touch her and this is the only thing I can do and im going fucking crazy just sitting and staring at her or googling her stats."" And he looked at me and said, ""okay girl, im going to hug you, we're going to go get a coffee, and then im going to show you another room."" And we got coffee and he took me into a little library at the back of the other kids playroom. And he told me to pick out 2 or 3 books. And he sat me down in the recliner next to my daughter and said, 


""Read to that baby. Sleep when you can, and take everything else they allow you to have control over hour by hour, day by day, and I promise you'll get through this. This is something you CAN control, and she is supposed to still be inside you, listening to you talk all day. She knows your voice and she probably misses it as much as you miss her being inside of you. This will remind her of home, and when she can open her eyes she will be able to trace your voice to you and know her mama.""


I cannot stress enough how much that man saved my life that day. I have bipolar disorder and postpartum has hit me like a freight train on top of it. The separation after the traumatic birth where I didn't see my daughter for 6 hours after I delivered her definitely gave me some PTSD and nightmarish separation anxiety and I haven't left this hospital the entire 35 days we've been here. Of course i tried. But this was supposed to be my maternity leave. I felt like my body failed her, and I can't leave if she's not leaving. And I know that's not rational and I am so lucky to be in the situation I am in where I CAN stay, but it is what it is. 

Anyway, I hope this advice helps some mama's whose babies are virtually untouchable at first. I love and am rooting for all of you out there. ‚ù§Ô∏èü©∂üíõüíöüíô",6,1754209882.0,NICUParents,1,1.0,False

¬† The satellite radio was playing soft jazz, a compromise. Lacy, the owner of the Prius and thus the radio, loathed rap almost as much as Hugo, her passenger, loathed contemporary country. They had failed to agree on sports talk, public radio, golden oldies, adult comedy, and the BBC, without getting near bluegrass, CNN, opera, or a hundred other stations. Out of frustration on her part and fatigue on his, they both threw in the towel early and settled on soft jazz. Soft, so Hugo‚Äôs deep and lengthy nap would not be disturbed. Soft, because Lacy didn‚Äôt care much for jazz either. It was another give-and-take of sorts, one of many that had sustained their teamwork over the years. He slept and she drove and both were content.  
  
¬† Before the Great Recession, the Board on Judicial Conduct had access to a small pool of state-owned Hondas, all with four doors and white paint and low mileage. With budget cuts, though, those disappeared. Lacy, Hugo, and countless other public employees in Florida were now expected to use their own vehicles for the state‚Äôs work, reimbursed at fifty cents a mile. Hugo, with four kids and a hefty mortgage, drove an ancient Bronco that could barely make it to the office, let alone a road trip. And so he slept.  
  
¬† Lacy enjoyed the quiet. She handled most of her cases alone, as did her colleagues. Deeper cuts had decimated the office, and the BJC was down to its last six investigators. Seven, in a state of twenty million people, with a thousand judges sitting in six hundred courtrooms and processing a half a million cases a year. Lacy was forever grateful that almost all judges were honest, hardworking people committed to justice and equality. Otherwise, she would have left long ago. The small number of bad apples kept her busy fifty hours a week.  
  
¬† She gently touched the signal switch and slowed on the exit ramp. When the car rolled to a stop, Hugo lurched forward as if wide awake and ready for the day. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlmost there. Twenty minutes. Time for you to roll to your right and snore at the window.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. Was I snoring?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou always snore, at least according to your wife.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, in my defense, I was walking the floor at three this morning with her latest child. I think it‚Äôs a girl. What‚Äôs her name?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWife or daughter?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHa-ha.‚Äù  
  
¬† The lovely and ever-pregnant Verna kept few secrets when it came to her husband. It was her calling to keep his ego in check and it was no small task. In another life, Hugo had been a football star in high school, then the top-rated signee in his class at Florida State, and the first freshman to crack the starting lineup. He‚Äôd been a tailback, both bruising and dazzling, for three and a half games anyway, until they carried him off on a stretcher with a jammed vertebra in his upper spine. He vowed to make a comeback. His mother said no. He graduated with honors and went to law school. His glory days were fading fast, but he would always carry some of the swagger possessed by all-Americans. He couldn‚Äôt help it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwenty minutes, huh?‚Äù he grunted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure, or not. If you like, I‚Äôll just leave you in the car with the motor running and you can sleep all day.‚Äù  
  
¬† He rolled to his right, closed his eyes, and said, ‚ÄúI want a new partner.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an idea, but the problem is nobody else will have you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd one with a bigger car.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt gets fifty miles a gallon.‚Äù  
  
¬† He grunted again, grew still, then twitched, jerked, mumbled, and sat straight up. He rubbed his eyes and said, ‚ÄúWhat are we listening to?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe had this conversation a long time ago, when we left Tallahassee, just as you were beginning to hibernate.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI offered to drive, as I recall.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, with one eye open. It meant so much. How‚Äôs Pippin?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe cries a lot. Usually, and I say this from vast experience, when a newborn cries it‚Äôs for a reason. Food, water, diaper, momma‚Äîwhatever. Not this one. She squawks for the hell of it. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll recall, I‚Äôve actually walked the floors with Pippin on two occasions.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, and God bless you. Can you come over tonight?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnytime. She‚Äôs number four. You guys thought about birth control?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe are beginning to have that conversation. And now that we‚Äôre on the subject, how‚Äôs your sex life?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. My mistake.‚Äù At thirty-six Lacy was single and attractive, and her sex life was a rich source of whispered curiosity around the office.  
  
¬† They were going east toward the Atlantic Ocean. St. Augustine was eight miles ahead. Lacy finally turned off the radio when Hugo asked, ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve been here before?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, a few years back. Then boyfriend and I spent a week on the beach in a friend‚Äôs condo.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA lot of sex?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere we go again. Is your mind always in the gutter?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, come to think of it, the answer has to be yes. Plus, you need to understand that Pippin is now a month old, which means that Verna and I have not had normal relations in at least three months. I still maintain, at least to myself, that she cut me off three weeks too early, but it‚Äôs sort of a moot point. Can‚Äôt really go back and catch up, you know? So things are fairly ramped up in my corner; not sure she feels the same way. Three rug rats and a newborn do serious damage to that intimacy thing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never know.‚Äù  
  
¬† He tried to focus on the highway for a mile or two, then his eyelids grew heavy and he began to nod. She glanced at him and smiled. In her nine years with the Board, she and Hugo had worked a dozen cases together. They made a nice team and trusted each other, and both knew that any bad behavior by him, and there had been none to date, would immediately be reported to Verna. Lacy worked with Hugo, but she gossiped and shopped with Verna.  
  
¬† St. Augustine was billed as the oldest city in America, the very spot where Ponce de Le√≥n landed and began exploring. Long on history and heavy on tourism, it was a lovely town with historic buildings and thick Spanish moss dripping from ancient oaks. As they entered its outskirts, the traffic slowed and tour buses stopped. To the right and in the distance, an old cathedral towered above the town. Lacy remembered it all very well. The week with the old boyfriend had been a disaster, but she had fond memories of St. Augustine.  
  
¬† One of many disasters.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd who is this mysterious deep throat we are supposed to meet?‚Äù Hugo asked, rubbing his eyes once again, now determined to stay awake.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know yet, but his code name is Randy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay, and please remind me why we are tag teaming a secret meeting with a man using an alias who has yet to file a formal complaint against one of our esteemed judges.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain. But I‚Äôve talked to him three times on the phone and he sounds, uh, rather earnest.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat. When was the last time you talked to a complaining party who didn‚Äôt sound, uh, rather earnest?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStick with me, okay? Michael said go, and we‚Äôre here.‚Äù Michael was the director, their boss.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course. No clue as to the alleged unethical conduct?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh yes. Randy said it was big.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGee, never heard that before.‚Äù  
  
¬† They turned onto King Street and poked along with the downtown traffic. It was mid-July, still the high season in north Florida, and tourists in shorts and sandals drifted along the sidewalks, apparently going nowhere. Lacy parked on a side street and they joined the tourists. They found a coffee shop and killed half an hour flipping through glossy real estate brochures. At noon, as instructed, they walked into Luca‚Äôs Grill and got a table for three. They ordered iced tea and waited. Thirty minutes passed with no sign of Randy, so they ordered sandwiches. Fries on the side for Hugo, fruit for Lacy. Eating as slowly as possib  
le, they kept an eye on the door and waited.  
  
¬† As lawyers, they valued their time. As investigators, they had learned patience. The two roles were often in conflict.  
  
¬† At 2:00 p.m., they gave up and returned to the car, as smothering as a sauna. As Lacy turned the key, her cell phone rattled. Caller unknown. She grabbed it and said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† A male voice said, ‚ÄúI asked you to come alone.‚Äù It was Randy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI suppose you have the right to ask. We were supposed to meet at noon, for lunch.‚Äù  
  
¬† A pause, then, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the Municipal Marina, at the end of King Street, three blocks away. Tell your buddy to get lost and we‚Äôll talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook, Randy, I‚Äôm not a cop and I don‚Äôt do cloak-and-dagger very well. I‚Äôll meet you, say hello and all that, but if I don‚Äôt have your real name within sixty seconds then I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù  
  
¬† She canceled the call and mumbled, ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äî  
  
¬† The marina was busy with pleasure craft and a few fishing boats coming and going. A long pontoon was unloading a gaggle of noisy tourists. A restaurant with a patio at the water‚Äôs edge was still doing a brisk business. Crews on charter boats were spraying decks and sprucing things up for tomorrow‚Äôs charters.  
  
¬† Lacy walked along the central pier, looking for the face of a man she‚Äôd never met. Ahead, standing next to a fuel pump, an aging beach bum gave a slight, awkward wave and nodded. She returned the nod and kept walking. He was about sixty, with too much gray hair flowing from under a Panama hat. Shorts, sandals, a gaudy floral-print shirt, the typical bronze, leathery skin of someone who spent far too much time in the sun. His eyes were covered by aviator shades. With a smile he stepped forward and said, ‚ÄúYou must be Lacy Stoltz.‚Äù  
  
¬† She took his hand and said, ‚ÄúYes, and you are?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Ramsey Mix. A pleasure to meet you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA pleasure. We were supposed to meet at noon.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy apologies. Had a bit of boat trouble.‚Äù He nodded down the pier to a large powerboat moored at the end of the dock. It wasn‚Äôt the longest boat in the harbor at that moment, but it was close. ‚ÄúCan we talk there?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOn the boat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure. It‚Äôs much more private.‚Äù  
  
¬† Crawling onto a boat with a complete stranger struck her as a bad idea and she hesitated. Before she could answer, Mix asked, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the black guy?‚Äù He was looking in the direction of King Street. Lacy turned and saw Hugo casually following a pack of tourists nearing the marina.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my colleague,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSort of a bodyguard?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a bodyguard, Mr. Mix. We‚Äôre not armed, but my friend there could pitch you into the water in about two seconds.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope that won‚Äôt be necessary. I come in peace.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear. I‚Äôll get on the boat only if it stays where it is. If the engines start, then our meeting is over.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù  
  
¬† She followed him along the pier, past a row of sailboats that looked as though they had not seen the open sea in months, and to his boat, cleverly named Conspirator. He stepped on board and offered a hand to help her. On the deck, under a canvas awning, there was a small wooden table with four folding chairs. He waved at it and said, ‚ÄúWelcome aboard. Have a seat.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy took quick stock of her surroundings. Without sitting, she said, ‚ÄúAre we alone?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, not entirely. I have a friend who enjoys boating with me. Name is Carlita. Would you like to meet her?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOnly if she‚Äôs important to your story.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe is not.‚Äù Mix was looking at the marina, where Hugo was leaning on a rail. Hugo waved, as if to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching everything.‚Äù Mix waved back and said, ‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Lacy said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs it safe to assume that whatever I‚Äôm about to tell you will be rehashed with Mr. Hatch in short order?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my colleague. We work together on some cases, maybe this one. How do you know his name?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI happen to own a computer. Checked out the website. BJC really should update it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know. Budget cuts.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis name vaguely rings a bell.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe had a brief career as a football player at Florida State.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm a Gator fan myself.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy refused to respond to this. It was so typical of the South, where folks attached themselves to college football teams with a fanaticism she‚Äôd always found irksome.  
  
¬† Mix said, ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôll know everything?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall him over. I‚Äôll get us something to drink.‚Äù  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† Carlita served drinks from a wooden tray‚Äîdiet sodas for Lacy and Hugo, a bottle of beer for Mix. She was a pretty Hispanic lady, at least twenty years his junior, and she seemed pleased to have guests, especially another woman.  
  
¬† Lacy made a note on her legal pad and said, ‚ÄúA quick question. The phone you used fifteen minutes ago had a different number than the phone you used last week.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that a question?‚Äù Mix replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs close enough.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. I use a lot of prepaid phones. And I move around all the time. I‚Äôm assuming the number I have for you is a cell phone issued by your employer, correct?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. We don‚Äôt use personal phones for state business, so my number is not likely to change.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll make it simpler, I guess. My phones change by the month, sometimes by the week.‚Äù  
  
¬† So far, in their first five minutes together, everything Mix said had only opened the door for more questions. Lacy was still miffed at being stood up for lunch, and she didn‚Äôt like the first impression he made. She said, ‚ÄúOkay, Mr. Mix, at this point Hugo and I go silent. You start talking. Tell us your story, and if it has huge gaps that require us to fish around and stumble in the dark, then we‚Äôll get bored and go home. You were coy enough on the phone to lure me here. Start talking.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mix looked at Hugo with a smile and asked, ‚ÄúShe always this blunt?‚Äù  
  
¬† Hugo, unsmiling, nodded yes. He folded his hands on the table and waited. Lacy put down her pen.  
  
¬† Mix swallowed a mouthful of beer and began: ‚ÄúI practiced law for thirty years in Pensacola. Small firm‚Äîwe usually had five or six lawyers. Back in the day we did well and life was good. One of my early clients was a developer, a real high roller who built condos, subdivisions, hotels, strip malls, the typical Florida stuff that goes up overnight. I never trusted the guy but he was making so much money I finally took the bait. He got me in some deals, small slices here and there, and for a while it all worked. I started dreaming of getting rich, which, in Florida anyway, can lead to serious trouble. My friend was cooking the books and taking on way too much debt, stuff I didn‚Äôt know about. Turns out there were some bogus loans, bogus everything, really, and the FBI came in with one of its patented RICO cluster bombs and indicted half of Pensacola, me included. A lot of folks got burned‚Äîdevelopers, bankers, realtors, lawyers, and other shysters. You probably didn‚Äôt hear about it because you investigate judges, not lawyers. Anyway, I flipped, sang like a choirboy, got a deal, pled to one count of mail fraud, and spent sixteen months in a federal camp. Lost my license and made a lot of enemies. Now I lie low. I applied for reinstatement and got my license back. I have one client these days, and he‚Äôs the guy we‚Äôll talk about from now on. Questions?‚Äù From the empty chair, he retrieved an unmarked file and handed it to Lacy. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the scoop on me. Newspaper articles, my plea agreement, all the stuff you might need. I‚Äôm legit, or as legit an any ex-con can be, and every word I‚Äôm saying is true.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your address now?‚Äù Hugo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a brother up in Myrtle Beach and I use his address for legal purposes. Carlita has a place in Tampa and I get some mail there. Basically, though, I live on this boat. I have phones, fax, Wi-Fi, a small shower, cold beer, and a  
nice lady. I‚Äôm a happy guy. We bounce around Florida, the Keys, the Bahamas. Not a bad retirement, thanks to Uncle Sam.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy do you have a client?‚Äù Lacy asked, ignoring the file.  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the friend of an old friend who knows my shady past and figures I‚Äôll roll the dice for a fat fee. He‚Äôs right. My friend looked me up, then convinced me to take his case. Don‚Äôt ask for the client‚Äôs name, because I don‚Äôt have it. My friend is the intermediary.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the name of your client?‚Äù Lacy asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, nor do I want to.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre we supposed to ask why or just accept this?‚Äù Hugo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGap number one, Mr. Mix,‚Äù Lacy said. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt do gaps. You tell us everything or we‚Äôll leave and take nothing with us.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust relax, okay?‚Äù Mix said as he chugged some beer. ‚ÄúThis is a long story that will take some time to unfold. It involves a ton of money, corruption that is astonishing, and some really nasty guys who wouldn‚Äôt think twice about putting a bullet or two between my eyes, yours, my client‚Äôs, anyone who asks too many questions.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a long pause as Lacy and Hugo allowed this to sink in. Finally, she asked, ‚ÄúThen why are you in the game?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMoney. My client wants to pursue a claim under the Florida Whistleblower Statute. He dreams of collecting millions. Me, I‚Äôll take a nice cut, and if all goes well, I‚Äôll never need clients.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen he must be a state employee,‚Äù Lacy said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know the law, Ms. Stoltz. You have a demanding job, I don‚Äôt. I have plenty of time to pore over the code sections and case law. Yes, my client is employed by the State of Florida. No, his identity cannot be revealed; not now, anyway. Perhaps, way down the road, if money is on the table, then maybe we can convince a judge to maintain a closed file. But, to kick things off, my client is far too frightened to sign a formal complaint with Judicial Conduct.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe cannot proceed without a signed, formal complaint,‚Äù Lacy said. ‚ÄúThe statute, as you know, is very clear.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIndeed I do. I‚Äôll sign the complaint.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUnder oath?‚Äù Hugo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, as required. I believe my client is telling the truth and I‚Äôm willing to sign my name.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not afraid?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived with fear for a long time. I guess I‚Äôm accustomed to it, though things could get worse.‚Äù Mix reached for another file and withdrew some papers, which he placed on the table. He continued, ‚ÄúSix months ago, I went to court up in Myrtle Beach and changed my name. I‚Äôm now Greg Myers, the name I‚Äôll use on the complaint.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy read the court order from South Carolina and, for the first time, doubted the wisdom of traveling to St. Augustine to meet this guy. A state employee too frightened to come forward. A reformed lawyer so spooked that he went to court in another state and changed his name. An ex-con with no real address.  
  
¬† Hugo read the court order and, for the first time in years, wished he could carry a gun. He asked, ‚ÄúDo you consider yourself to be in hiding at this moment?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I‚Äôm just real cautious, Mr. Hatch. I‚Äôm an experienced boat captain who knows the water, the seas, the currents and cays and keys and remote beaches and hideaways far better than anyone looking for me, if, in fact, anyone is back there.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy said, ‚ÄúWell, it certainly sounds like you‚Äôre hiding.‚Äù  
  
¬† Myers just nodded as though he agreed. All three took a sip. A breeze finally arrived and broke some of the humidity. Lacy flipped through the thin file and said, ‚ÄúA question. Were your legal troubles in any way connected to the judicial misconduct you want to discuss?‚Äù  
  
¬† The nodding stopped as he weighed the question. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hugo said, ‚ÄúBack to this mysterious client. Do you have any direct contact with him?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNone whatsoever. He refuses to use e-mail, snail mail, fax, or any type of traceable phone. He talks to the intermediary, the intermediary either visits me face-to-face or calls me on a burner, one of those disposable phones. It‚Äôs awkward and time-consuming, but quite safe. No trail, no records, nothing left behind.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd if you needed him right now, how would you find him?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never happened. I suppose I would call the middleman and wait an hour or so.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere does this client live?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. Somewhere along the Florida Panhandle.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy took a deep breath and exchanged glances with Hugo. She said, ‚ÄúOkay, what‚Äôs the story?‚Äù  
  
¬† Myers gazed into the distance, across the water, beyond the boats. A drawbridge was opening and he seemed mesmerized by it. Finally, he said, ‚ÄúThere are many chapters to the story, some still being written. The purpose of this little meeting is to tell you enough to make you curious, but also to frighten you enough to back off if you want. That‚Äôs the real question right now: Do you want to get involved?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs there judicial misconduct?‚Äù Lacy asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòmisconduct‚Äô would be a massive understatement. What I know involves corruption at a level never before known in this country. You see, Ms. Stoltz and Mr. Hatch, my sixteen months in prison were not completely wasted. They put me in charge of the law library and I kept my nose in the books. I‚Äôve studied every single case of judicial corruption that‚Äôs ever been prosecuted, in all fifty states. I have the research, the files, notes, everything. I‚Äôm quite the resource, just in case you ever need a know-it-all. And the story I can tell you involves more dirty cash than all the others combined. It also involves bribery, extortion, intimidation, rigged trials, at least two murders, and one wrongful conviction. There‚Äôs a man rotting away on death row an hour from here who was framed. The man responsible for the crime is probably sitting on his boat right now, a boat much nicer than mine.‚Äù  
  
¬† He paused, took a drink from his bottle, and gave them a smug look, satisfied that he had their complete attention. ‚ÄúThe question is, do you want to get involved? It could be dangerous.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy call us?‚Äù Hugo asked. ‚ÄúWhy not go to the FBI?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve dealt with the FBI, Mr. Hatch, and things went badly. I don‚Äôt trust them or anyone with a badge, especially in this state.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy said, ‚ÄúAgain, Mr. Myers, we are not armed. We‚Äôre not criminal investigators. It sounds like you need several branches of the federal government.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut you have subpoena power,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúYou have statutes that give you the right to obtain subpoenas. You can require any judge in this state to produce every record maintained in his or her office. You have considerable power, Ms. Stoltz. So in many ways you do investigate criminal activity.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hugo said, ‚ÄúTrue, but we‚Äôre not equipped to deal with gangsters. If your story is true, it sounds like the bad guys are well organized.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEver hear of the Catfish Mafia?‚Äù Myers asked after another long pull on the bottle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Hugo replied. Lacy shook her head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs another long story. Yes, Mr. Hatch, it‚Äôs a gang that‚Äôs well organized. They have a long history of committing crimes that are none of your concern because they do not involve members of the judiciary. But, there is one enterprise in which they‚Äôve purchased a judge. And that does concern you.‚Äù  
  
¬† The Conspirator rocked in the wake of an old shrimp boat and for a moment all three were quiet. Lacy asked, ‚ÄúWhat if we decline to get involved? What happens to your story?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf I file a formal complaint, aren‚Äôt you required to get involved?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn theory, yes. As I‚Äôm sure you know, we have forty-five days to do an assessment to determine if the complaint has some merit. We then notify the target, the judge, and ruin his day. But we can also be very adept at ignoring complaints.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hugo said with a smile, ‚ÄúOh yes. We‚Äôre bureaucrats. We can duck and delay with the best of them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt duck this one,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too big.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs so big, why hasn‚Äôt it been discovered before now?‚Äù Lacy asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs still unfolding. Because the time hasn‚Äôt been right. Because of a lot of reasons, Ms. Stoltz, the most important being the fact that no one with the knowledge has been w  
illing to step forward until now. I‚Äôm stepping forward. The question is simply this: Does the Board on Judicial Conduct want to investigate the most corrupt judge in the history of American jurisprudence?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne of our very own?‚Äù Lacy asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou got it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen do we get his name?‚Äù Hugo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre assuming it‚Äôs a male.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not assuming anything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good way to start.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äî  
  
¬† The tepid breeze finally gave up, and the oscillating fan rattling above them did little more than shove around the sticky air. Myers seemed to be the last of the three to realize their shirts were sticking to their skin and, as host of the little gathering, finally made a move. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a stroll over to the restaurant there and have a drink,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have a bar inside with plenty of AC.‚Äù He clutched an olive-colored leather courier bag, well used and seemingly attached to his body. Lacy wondered what was inside. A small pistol? Cash, a fake passport? Perhaps another file?  
  
¬† As they walked along the pier, Lacy asked, ‚ÄúIs this one of your hangouts?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy would I answer that?‚Äù Myers retorted, and Lacy wished she‚Äôd said nothing. She was dealing with an invisible man, one who lived as if his neck was always near the block, and not some casual sailor who bounced from port to port. Hugo shook his head. Lacy kicked herself in the rump.  
  
¬† The restaurant was empty now, and they took a table inside, overlooking the harbor. After roasting in the heat for the past hour, they found the air almost too frigid. Iced tea for the investigators, coffee for Mr. Myers. They were alone; no one could possibly hear them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat if we‚Äôre not too enthused about this case?‚Äù Hugo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen I suppose I‚Äôll eventually go to Plan B, but I don‚Äôt really want to. Plan B involves the press, a couple of reporters I know, neither of whom is completely reliable. One is in Mobile, the other in Miami. Frankly, I think they‚Äôll spook easily.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat makes you so sure we won‚Äôt spook easily, Mr. Myers?‚Äù Lacy asked. ‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve said, we‚Äôre not accustomed to dealing with gangsters. We have a full caseload anyway.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you do. No shortage of bad judges.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúActually, there aren‚Äôt many. Just a few bad apples, but there are enough disgruntled litigants to keep us busy. Lots of complaints, most of which have little merit.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Myers slowly removed his aviator shades and placed them on the table. His eyes were puffy and red, like a drinker‚Äôs, and they were encircled by pale skin, a contrast that gave him the resemblance to an inverted raccoon. It was obvious he rarely took the glasses off. He glanced around once more, as if to make sure those after him were not in the restaurant, and he seemed to relax.  
  
¬† Hugo said, ‚ÄúAbout this Catfish Mafia.‚Äù  
  
¬† Myers grunted with a smile, as if he couldn‚Äôt wait to spin a yarn. ‚ÄúYou want the story, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou brought it up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù The waitress placed their drinks on the table and disappeared. Myers took a sip and began: ‚ÄúIt goes back fifty years or so. Kind of a loose gang of bad boys who misbehaved in various parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, anywhere they could bribe a sheriff. Mainly bootleg booze, prostitution, gambling, sort of the old-fashioned sins, I guess, but with a lot of muscle and no shortage of dead bodies. They would pick a wet county near a Baptist desert, preferably on a state line, and set up their operations. Invariably, the locals would get fed up, elect a new sheriff, and the thugs would leave town. Over time, they settled along the Mississippi coast, around Biloxi and Gulfport. The ones who didn‚Äôt get shot were indicted and sent to prison. Almost all of the original gangsters were gone by the early 1980s, but there were a few leftovers from a younger generation. When gambling was legalized in Biloxi, it really knocked a hole in their business. They moved to Florida and discovered the allure of bogus land deals, along with the astonishing margins in cocaine trafficking. They made a lot of money, reorganized, and morphed into an outfit known as the Coast Mafia.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hugo was shaking his head. ‚ÄúI grew up in north Florida, went to college here, and law school, lived here my whole life, and for the past ten years I‚Äôve investigated judicial corruption, and I‚Äôve never heard of the Coast Mafia.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt advertise, and their names are never in the papers. I doubt if a member has been arrested in the past ten years. It‚Äôs a small network, very tight and disciplined. I suspect most members are blood kin. It probably would have been infiltrated, busted, and everyone sent to prison but for the rise of a guy I‚Äôll call Omar for the moment. A bad dude but a very smart man. In the mid-1980s, Omar led the gang to south Florida, which at the time was ground zero for cocaine trafficking. They had a few good years, then things went to hell when they crossed up some Colombians. Omar got shot. His brother got shot too, except he didn‚Äôt survive and his body was never found. They fled Miami but not Florida. Omar has a brilliant criminal mind, and about twenty years ago he became infatuated with the idea of casinos on Indian land.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy am I not surprised?‚Äù Lacy mumbled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou got it. As you probably know, there are now nine Indian casinos in Florida, seven of which are owned by the Seminoles, which is by far the largest tribe, and one of only three recognized by the federal government. As a whole, the Seminole casinos are grossing four billion a year. Omar and his boys found the opportunity irresistible.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy said, ‚ÄúSo, your story involves organized criminals, Indians who own casinos, and a crooked judge, all in bed together?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fair summary.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut the FBI has jurisdiction over Indian matters,‚Äù Hugo said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, and the FBI has never shown much enthusiasm for going after Indians for any type of wrongdoing. Plus, Mr. Hatch, and please listen as I repeat myself, I‚Äôm not dealing with the FBI. They don‚Äôt have the facts. I do, and I‚Äôm talking to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen do we get the whole story?‚Äù Lacy asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs soon as your boss, Mr. Geismar, gives the green light. You talk to him, relay what I‚Äôve said, make sure he understands the dangers involved, and when he tells me, on the phone, that the Board on Judicial Conduct will take my formal complaint seriously and investigate it fully, then I‚Äôll fill in as many blanks as possible.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hugo tapped his knuckles on the table and thought about his family. Lacy watched another shrimp boat inch through the harbor and wondered how Geismar would react. Myers watched them and almost felt sorry for them.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† The Board on Judicial Conduct‚Äôs home was one-half of the third floor in a four-story state office building in downtown Tallahassee, two blocks from the Capitol. Every aspect of its ‚Äúsuite‚Äù‚Äîfrom the worn, fraying carpet, to the narrow, prisonlike windows that somehow managed to deflect most sunlight, to the paneled ceiling squares still stained by decades of cigarette smoke, to the walls covered by cheap shelving that swayed and bent under the weight of thick briefs and forgotten memorandums‚Äîall of it reeked of straining and declining budgets, not to mention the obvious fact that the agency‚Äôs work was not exactly a pressing priority with the Governor and the legislature. Each January, Michael Geismar, BJC‚Äôs longtime director, was forced to walk over to the Capitol, hat in hand, and watch as the house and senate committees split the revenue pie. Groveling was required. He always asked for a few more bucks, and he always received a few less. Such was the life of the director of an agency that most lawmakers did not even know existed.  
  
¬† The Board was comprised of five political appointees, usually retired judges and lawyers who found favor with the Governor. They met six times a year to review complaints, conduct hearings that resembled trials, and get updates from Geismar and his staff. He needed more staff but there was no money. His six investigators‚Äîfour in Tallahassee and two in Fort Lauderdale‚Äîwere working an average of fifty hours a week, and almost all were secretly looking for other jobs.  
  
¬† From Geismar‚Äôs corner office, he had the vie  
w, if he chose to take it, which he rarely did, of another bunker-type edifice even taller than his, and beyond that a hodgepodge of government office buildings. His office was large because he‚Äôd knocked out walls and added a long table, the only one in the maze of cubbyholes and cubicles BJC called home. When the Board met for official business, it borrowed a conference room in the Florida Supreme Court building.  
  
¬† Today, four people gathered around the table: Geismar, Lacy, Hugo, and BJC‚Äôs secret weapon, an ancient paralegal named Sadelle, who, even pushing the age of seventy, was still able not only to research vast amounts of material but to remember it all as well. Thirty years earlier, Sadelle had finished law school but failed the bar exam, on three occasions, and was thus relegated to the role of permanent paralegal. Once a heavy smoker‚Äîa good portion of the smoke-stained windows and ceilings could be blamed on her‚Äîshe had been battling lung cancer for the past three years but had yet to miss a full week of work.  
  
¬† The table was covered with paperwork, with many of the sheets unstapled and highlighted in yellow or edited in red. Hugo was saying, ‚ÄúThe guy checks out. We‚Äôve talked to contacts in Pensacola, people who knew him when he was a lawyer. Nice reputation and all, at least until he got indicted. He is who he says he is, albeit with a new name.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lacy added, ‚ÄúHis prison record is spotless. Served sixteen months and four days in a federal prison in Texas and for most of that time he ran the prison law library. Quite the jailhouse lawyer, he helped several of his buddies with their appeals, even sprang two on early release because their lawyers had screwed up the sentencing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd his conviction?‚Äù Geismar asked.

I mean, how else would I be typing this? But you‚Äôve probably never heard of it. Or at least, you don‚Äôt remember.¬†



I live in the state of Sequoyah. The proud 38th state to join the United States of America. Tucked between Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We formally joined the Union in 1868, right after the ratification of the 14th Amendment.

Before that, Sequoyah was an independent Cherokee Indian reservation.

But protected reservations don‚Äôt pay taxes, and the war-torn South wasn‚Äôt gonna pay for itself. So, the U.S. snatched up the land, and just like that, Sequoyah was born. Everyone living here got labeled a tax-eligible citizen.

This probably sounds insane to all of you, but I‚Äôve lived here my whole life. We‚Äôre being erased. Not metaphorically. I mean nobody outside of Sequoyah has any evidence we were ever here.

I started noticing a change about a year ago.

The capital city, Gist, sits right near the point where Tennessee, Georgia, and Sequoyah meet. Because of that, we used to get a steady stream of tourists; mostly folks from further south coming up to see the leaves change and stare at the mountains.

But then the tourists started thinning out. And the ones who *did* show up always looked lost. Like they didn‚Äôt know how they got here or what this place even was.¬†

I was working a shift at my aunt‚Äôs coffeehouse, *Gist a Sip*, when a lady walked in. She looked about my age, early 20s, with a confused look on her face.

‚ÄúWelcome to Gist a Sip! Take a seat and I‚Äôll be right with you,‚Äù I said, going through my usual customer service routine.

‚ÄúActually, I was just hoping to get directions,‚Äù she said, kind of glancing around. ‚ÄúThis place isn‚Äôt on my GPS.‚Äù

I figured she had to be mistaken. I mean, this is Gist. The capital of Sequoyah. We‚Äôre not Atlanta, but we‚Äôre definitely not some middle-of-nowhere ghost town either.

‚ÄúHuh, odd,‚Äù I said, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it as I walked over. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in Gist. Where are you trying to get to?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, where is Gist? I‚Äôm supposed to be in North Carolina right now.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about an hour out. This is Sequoyah.‚Äù

Her face dropped, like she thought she misheard me.

‚ÄúSequoyah? What is that?‚Äù



I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes.

‚ÄúIs that a joke?‚Äù I was genuinely asking, but her face told me it wasn‚Äôt.

I pointed to the map on the wall. ‚ÄúNo disrespect, but nobody‚Äôs ever asked me that before. Are you from out of the country?‚Äù I tried to keep it light.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Savannah,‚Äù she said, still looking shaken.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from Georgia and you don‚Äôt know about the state right above you?‚Äù I cracked a smile, still trying to be nice. ‚ÄúNot so sure you should be traveling alone.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt smile back.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no state called Sequoyah. I should be in North Carolina right now. Look.‚Äù

She pulled out her phone and showed me her GPS. It looked like it was glitching. Constantly rerouting, stuttering like it was looking for roads that didn‚Äôt exist. And sure enough, Sequoyah wasn‚Äôt on the map. Tennessee touched North Carolina directly, like someone had cropped us out in a bad Photoshop.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. Your GPS must be glitching or something. Here, take a seat and we‚Äôll pour you some coffee and get you a map.‚Äù I tried to be courteous. She was visibly shaken, and her eyes were darting around like she was looking for an exit. I needed her to calm down before she scared the other customers.

She thanked me, and I sat down beside her to help her work through the map. She looked like she was trying to read a foreign language.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked, starting to wonder if maybe she wasn‚Äôt mentally well.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ally,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúHi Ally, I‚Äôm Brenda,‚Äù I responded with a smile. ‚ÄúAre you feeling okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶ but this is all impossible.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

I guess I know better now but imagine being told your entire state didn‚Äôt exist and you shouldn‚Äôt be there. What would you have said?

‚ÄúIs there someone I should call for you? Any friends or family? I‚Äôm worried about you getting back on the road like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah. I can call my mom.‚Äù She pulled out her phone and dialed. Then she put it on speaker.

A cheery voice came through the speaker.

‚ÄúHey Ally, how‚Äôs the trip? Did you get there okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, what states border Georgia?‚Äù she asked, frantically. I thought hopefully her mom could talk some sense into her.

‚ÄúWell... there‚Äôs Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. What‚Äôs this about?‚Äù

I looked down at the phone like her mom could feel the glare I was giving through it.

Ally‚Äôs face sank even further as she looked back at me.

‚ÄúWhat about Sequoyah?‚Äù I said into the phone, confident that this family just sucked at geography.

‚ÄúSequoyah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù the woman on the other end asked.

Ally looked up at me, clearly feeling vindicated. I could tell she didn‚Äôt trust me anymore.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶ I got turned around and ended up in a town I don‚Äôt recognize. My GPS isn‚Äôt working. They‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm in a state called Sequoyah. I was just in Georgia. I should be in North Carolina right now. Mom, this isn‚Äôt making any sense. Where am I?‚Äù

She was starting to spiral.

I tried to calm things down. Other customers were starting to look her way.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt understand. You‚Äôre in the state of Sequoyah, in the town of Gist. I want to help you, but you need to try to stay calm.‚Äù

I debated calling 911. This woman clearly needed to be evaluated. Her mom backing her up wasn‚Äôt helping.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny!‚Äù she said, fighting tears. ‚ÄúI know I crossed the Georgia border. I know I should be in North Carolina right now. You‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm in a state that doesn‚Äôt even exist!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I pulled out my ID. ‚ÄúLook, this is a Sequoyah state ID. If you go outside, you‚Äôll see Sequoyah license plates on almost every car. Sequoyah‚Äôs been a real state for over 100 years.‚Äù

It was no use. She ran out of the coffee shop and got into her car. She sped off down the road, the map still spread out on the table where she left it.

I took a second to catch my breath. I‚Äôve had some weird customers before, but that was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.

Except it kept happening.

My best friend Will worked at the old gift shop down the street. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúYou Get The Gist.‚Äù We really like our puns around here.

Anyway, he had to find a new job a couple months ago when the business suddenly shut down. Delivery orders just stopped coming in. When they called the supplier, they said all the orders were getting returned with an invalid address. The supplier insisted they didn‚Äôt know a city called Gist and were sure there was no state called Sequoyah.

There haven‚Äôt been many tourists lately. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the last time I served coffee to a face I didn‚Äôt recognize.

I saw a news article the other day about a missing woman. It was Ally, the same woman from the coffee shop about a year ago. She left home for a trip up north and never made it. Reportedly, she made hundreds of calls to friends and family trying to get help. The investigation went cold when detectives couldn‚Äôt trace any of her calls to a real location.

I decided to call the tipline. They told me I should be ashamed for making prank calls to a missing persons hotline.

So, this is my last resort. I‚Äôm writing this in case anyone out there can tell me what the hell is going on.

Do you remember Sequoyah?

And if you‚Äôre from Sequoyah reading this, please help explain to these people that I‚Äôm not crazy. There are hundreds of thousands of us here, but according to the world outside our borders, we don‚Äôt exist.

Chapter 1
The year we hated each other most,

Sebastian and I swore to make each other‚Äôs life a living hell.

He hated me for scheming my way into Vivienne‚Äôs place in the marriage pact with the Valentine Syndicate.

I hated him for marrying me with his heart still tied to another.

For five years, our marriage was a battleground‚Äînever once a true union.

Then came the shooting overseas.

He threw himself over me without hesitation, taking the bullets for me.

Blood poured from his mouth as he collapsed on top of me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt read into it,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúJust a Doctor‚Äôs instinct.‚Äù

‚ÄúHelena‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs a next life, don‚Äôt choose me again. I never knew how to love you right‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then I opened my eyes‚Äî and it was the day of the engagement all over again.

This time, I went straight to my father.

‚ÄúSending an illegitimate daughter to the Valentine Syndicate might offend the wrong people. It has to be me.‚Äù

Sebastian Lowell, consider this my way of repaying your sacrifice.

I‚Äôll marry into their world‚Äîand give you back your freedom.


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre volunteering to take Vivienne‚Äôs place in the marriage to the Valentine heir?‚Äù

My father‚Äôs cigar slipped from his fingers.

His shock wasn‚Äôt unwarranted.

I‚Äôd always hated Vivienne Whitmore with every fiber of my being.

The first time we met, I almost struck her with a riding crop.

Someone like me, stepping in to take her place in a foreign marriage alliance? Unthinkable.

He frowned. ‚ÄúYesterday, you swore you‚Äôd only never marry anyone but Sebastian.‚Äù

I kept my voice calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the rightful daughter of the Whitmore family. Sending an illegitimate child in my place might insult them. This is something only I can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs for Sebastian‚Ä¶ let Vivienne have him.‚Äù

There was a flicker in his eyes‚Äîsomething between disbelief and reluctant pride.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve grown up. Well then‚Ä¶ as you wish.‚Äù

He hadn‚Äôt changed‚Äîstill the same hypocrite.

No matter how he masked it, Vivienne had always been his favorite.

If it weren't for me using the board of directors to pressure him in my past life, he would definitely have forcibly sent me out.

I turned to leave with a cold laugh, only to run into Sebastian in the hallway, dressed in a white sweater.

He was standing beneath the wall sconce, the amber light casting a soft glow across his sculpted features.

‚ÄúSo? Who‚Äôs headed to Castalia?‚Äù

He crossed the hallway quickly, urgency etched into his face.

I gave him a faint smile. ‚ÄúWho would you rather sent?‚Äù

Sebastian froze for a beat. His voice dropped low.

‚ÄúAll I know is, the Valentine Syndicate isn‚Äôt a family you cross lightly. They've been at odds with your family for years. There‚Äôs no way this marriage is in good faith.‚Äù

I looked him square in the eye. ‚ÄúBut the alliance had been sealed for years. It is set in stone. No matter what, either Vivienne or I has to go. So who would you pick?‚Äù

He glanced toward the study, then scoffed.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter what I think, does it? The Whitmore princess gets final say. Neither Vivienne nor I ever had a choice.‚Äù

I brushed past him and climbed the stairs.

‚ÄúThen keep your mouth shut if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Just as I expected‚Äîhis heart was still with Vivienne.

But it didn‚Äôt matter.

Considering it a way of repaying my life-saving grace in my past life, I didn't intend to tell Sebastian Lowell that it was me who married off to Castalia.

So, on their wedding day, He would watch Vivienne Whitmore appear before him in her wedding dress.

Back then, Sebastian Lowell would have been pleasantly surprised, wouldn‚Äôt he?

Thinking back to the five years of torture we'd endured in our previous lives, I slowly let out a breath.

Sebastian Lowell‚ÄîFine. This time, I‚Äôll give you what you want.

Chapter 2
I spent the entire night weighing the risks of the Valentine Syndicate.

They weren‚Äôt exactly upstanding members of society. Andreas Valentine, their heir, was said to be the next in line to lead the Syndicate.

No one knew his face. No one knew his age. For all I knew, I‚Äôd arrive in Castalia only to find out I was marrying some fifty-year-old crime lord.

In my past life, it was Vivienne who was offered to the Valentine family. She came back within two weeks‚Äîshaking, weeping, out of her mind.

As much as Richard Whitmore doted on his precious daughter, he didn‚Äôt dare offend the Syndicate. So he sent her back.

The second time, she didn‚Äôt make it. Andreas used her for target practice‚Äîshe collapsed from an asthma attack and died on the spot.

That death carved itself into Sebastian‚Äôs heart‚Äîand gave him yet another reason to despise me.

But this time, I was the one being shipped off overseas.

I had to ready. At the very least, I needed to sharpen my aim.

The next morning, I went straight to the shooting range.

With my goggles on and earmuffs tight, I gripped the pistol and fired‚Äîround after round, for three straight hours.

It wasn‚Äôt until nearly noon that I finally hit a few bullseyes‚Äîand allowed myself a breath of relief.

That‚Äôs when a hand clamped down on my wrist.

The grip was so tight it felt like my bones might shatter.

‚ÄúYou hate your own sister that much? You‚Äôd rather throw her to the wolves in Castalia?‚Äù

I jerked my hand free, pain flashing across my face. ‚ÄúStay out of it. Get lost.‚Äù

Sebastian stepped closer, eyes blazing red with anger.

‚ÄúVivienne‚Äôs ill‚Äîshe has asthma. Sending her is no different from killing her. Helena, when did you become so cruel?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you know she couldn‚Äôt sleep last night? She‚Äôs burning with fever, and here you are, playing games with a gun!‚Äù

‚ÄúLet. Go,‚Äù I snarled, jaw clenched.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think getting rid of her means I‚Äôll marry you,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never marry someone as cruel and calculating as you.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven if Ms. Sinclair were still alive, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd say the same. You‚Äôd shamed your own sister‚Äôs name.‚Äù

For a moment, the hatred in his eyes took me straight back to our past life‚Äî

Back to those endless, vicious fights that always circled back to Vivienne, cutting each other open, again and again.

Before I could stop myself, I kicked him down and lifted the pistol. I fired just beside his shoulder, the shot cracking into the dirt near his arm.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the right to speak her name.‚Äù

He‚Äôd promised her once, back when we were seven, that he‚Äôd take care of me.

That promise died the day Vivienne entered our world. He claimed it was to ‚Äúlook after the sick,‚Äù but I knew better.

The screams around us jolted him back to reality.

He looked at the red welt on my shoulder from the recoil and hesitated‚Äîhis expression softening.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Helena‚Ä¶‚Äù

I sidestepped before he could touch me, lips curling into a cold smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs far from over. Maybe things are not what they seem. You‚Äôre jumping to conclusions, Sebastian.‚Äù

But he just laughed bitterly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Whitmore heiress. Vivienne has no one. She‚Äôs all alone.‚Äù

He took a breath and looked at me‚Äîquietly, almost pleading.

‚ÄúHelena‚Ä¶ please. For the sake of everything we were, let Vivienne go.‚Äù

I gripped the pistol tighter and turned without another word. My chest heaved for just a second from how hard I was clenching my breath.

But this time, I was the one going to Castalia.

You got your wish, Sebastian Lowell.

That night, he sent a porcelain doll‚Äîjust like he used to when we were children and he‚Äôd wronged me.

I sent it right back without a second thought.

All those years, I thought he stayed by my side because of our childhood, because of the bond we shared.

It took five years of a miserable marriage to wake me up.

He was kind out of duty‚Äîbut it was always Vivienne he ached for.

And if that‚Äôs the case, then I have no reason to keep him in my life.

Chapter 3
I went to my father and asked for my mother‚Äôs belongings back‚Äî

just a sketchbook and easel that looked plain on the outside. But inside were nearly monthly portraits of me before the age of six‚Äî

Each drawn while she was bedridden, clinging to what little life she had left.

Each page carried the quiet, unwavering love of a mother etched in fading pencil lines.

I didn‚Äôt learn the truth until Vivienne moved into our home‚ÄîThat my mother had had taken her own life, driven to despair after my father‚Äôs affair.

Vivienne was just two years younger than me.

The day I found out, I nearly beat her within an inch of her life.

But my father used my mother‚Äôs last keepsakes to shut me up‚Äî

Threatening to destroy them if I ever revealed Vivienne‚Äôs bloodline.

Now that I was about to leave for Castalia, it was time to even the score.

I took the sketchbook, paid a visit to my uncle, and then made a quiet stop at the Whitmore Group‚Äôs boardroom.

After years of swallowing humiliation, I wouldn‚Äôt leave without leaving behind a gift‚Äîfor Richard, and for his precious bastard daughter.

Of course, none of it could leak before I left the country.

The timing had to be‚Ä¶ surgical.

When I got home, my bedroom had been completely emptied.

Everything I owned had been dumped into the living room‚Äî

Including the thirty-seven porcelain dolls Sebastian once crafted by my hand.

Each lay shattered, their delicate pieces scattered like worthless junk.

Vivienne stood nearby, guilt across her fate‚Äìbut the gleam in her eyes gave her away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Helena,‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúDad said your room gets the best light‚Äîit will help me recover fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs for the dolls, the maids knocked them over while moving furniture. I‚Äôll pay for them, whatever they cost. Daddy just gave me his Signature Gold Concierge Card.‚Äù

She held it up so casually‚Äîthe very card reserved for the Whitmore heir.

I stepped forward, expression unreadable.

Sebastian suddenly moved between us, as if bracing for an attack.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just dolls, Helena. Is this really worth a meltdown?‚Äù

But they weren‚Äôt just dolls.

Sebastian had crafted every one of them by hand.

He once promised he‚Äôd keep making them for me‚Äîfor as long as I liked.

Turns out his promises were just as fragile‚Äîand short-lived‚Äîas porcelain.

All it took was one little stunt from Vivienne, and they crumbled to dust.

Maybe my mistake was believing the promises of a man who‚Äôd already made his choice..

When I caught the smug glint in Vivienne‚Äôs eyes, I realized how pointless it all was.

I brushed past Sebastian, picked up my luggage, and moved into the guest room without a word.

He stood frozen at the bottom of the stairs, frowning as he watched me leave.

The next morning, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it to find all thirty-seven porcelain dolls lined up in silence‚Äîbrand new, unfired, still soft touch.

There was only one person who‚Äôd do this.

I let out a bitter laugh and shut the door without a word.

But half an hour later, I opened the door again.

And this time brought the dolls inside.

Chapter 4
Four days before my departure, aside from wringing a ‚Äúdowry‚Äù out of that sorry excuse for a father, I s threw myself into training‚Äîpushing my body, sharpening my aim.

After riding practice, I came home to find Richard hosting a lavish birthday party for Vivienne.

As I walked in, she was descending the stairs in a gown from my own wardrobe‚Äîdripping in crystal sequins, playing the part of a noble heiress in front of a crowd that clapped like trained seals.

A few of her loyal little followers spotted me and curled their lips into sneers.

‚ÄúVivienne‚Äôs about to marry into nobility, and her sister can‚Äôt show up for her birthday. Talk about heartless.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you expect? She‚Äôs the one who chickened out and forced Vivienne to take her place. That kind of heartless witch doesn‚Äôt care about family.‚Äù

Clearly, while I was gone, Vivienne had been spreading her sob story to anyone who‚Äôd listen.

I turned to head upstairs, not wasting breath on idiots.

But they blocked my way‚Äîeyes darting toward Vivienne, then back to me with feigned outrage.

‚ÄúRunning off already? What‚Äôs the matter‚Äîguilty much?‚Äù

‚ÄúLady Sinclair must be turning in her grave, seeing how savage her daughter turned out!‚Äù

Before she could finish, I snapped the whip from my riding lesson‚Äîit cracked through the air, slamming her straight into the drink table.

Glass shattered. Blood bloomed.

She screamed, collapsed, crystal shards embedded in her arms.

I stepped forward, cool and calm. ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs savage.‚Äù

The entire room froze, stunned by the sudden explosion of violence.

Then‚Äîchaos.

‚ÄúCall an ambulance!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs insane! She did it on purpose!‚Äù

As the noise surged around me, I climbed the stairs without looking back, whip in hand.

Vivienne stormed out of the room, rage burning in her eyes.

‚ÄúYou volunteered for this, remember? Now I have to stay and care for your father, and you still ruin my birthday?‚Äù

I grabbed her chin with one hand, lips curling into a faint smile. ‚ÄúVolunteered?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a homewrecker‚Äôs bastard with nothing but cheap tricks up your sleeve. The Syndicate isn‚Äôt a dumpster for hand-me-down bastards. If they don‚Äôt like what they see, they‚Äôll toss you out like yesterday‚Äôs trash.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd as for taking care of him?‚Äù

I tightened my grip. Her face went pale with pain.

‚ÄúAre you caring for Richard Whitmore or just circling his inheritance? You know damn well which it is. So drop the act‚Äîyou‚Äôre making people sick.‚Äù

Her cheeks flushed crimson with fury, but she didn‚Äôt dare argue out loud.

She fled sobbing‚Äîno, screaming‚Äîas three slender red snakes slid behind her like shadows.

‚ÄúI know I shouldn‚Äôt have used your room‚Äîbut did you really have to scare me like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ my asthma‚Äîit‚Äôs acting up again‚Ä¶‚Äù

She gasped dramatically and collapsed to the floor, clutching her chest.

‚ÄúVivienne!‚Äù

Sebastian rushed over and pulled her into his arms, glaring up at me with barely restrained fury.

‚ÄúAre you out of your mind? Do you even know what a shock like that could do to someone with asthma?! Are you insane?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think I did this?‚Äù

He gritted his teeth. ‚ÄúWho else? Vivienne wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly. But you? Helena‚Äîyou ride, you shoot, you climb cliffs. Nothing you do would surprise me.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, what if something rally happens to her? Then what? Who‚Äôs supposed to marry into the Syndicate in your place?‚Äù

Furious, I grabbed one of the snakes by the head and flung it straight at Vivienne.

‚ÄúAhhh!‚Äù

She shrieked as it landed inches her face, her pupils shrinking with terror‚Äîfunny how her asthma vanished.

I wanted to see if Sebastian would still defend her after that.

Of course, just as it neared her, Sebastian lunged forward‚Äîhis grip crushing my wrist like a vice.

‚ÄúStill denying it? Helena, when did you become so cold and cruel?‚Äù

Just like before.

Whenever it came to Vivienne, we‚Äôd go to war without hesitation.

But neither of us ever walked away.

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù

Richard stormed into the room, livid.

‚ÄúThis is what I get for not disciplining you! Attacking your own sister like this?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a daughter like you. You are dead to me‚Äîget out of my house!‚Äù

I turned, lips curled in a frigid smile.

Vivienne, ever the fragile saint, sniffled tearfully.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt scold her on my account‚Ä¶‚Äù

But Sebastian stayed silent.

He laid her in Richard‚Äôs arms with care‚Äîand then, quietly, fell into step behind me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you home.‚Äù

Chapter 5
Sebastian drove me to Willowcrest Cottage‚Äî

the private retreat my mother left me, a place only she and I ever shared. When we were young, he‚Äôd always come here with me whenever I was upset.

It used to be our escape‚Äîfrom them, from the house, from everything.

Before he left, he looked at me with something unreadable in his eyes.

‚ÄúWant me to stay the night?‚Äù he asked quietly.

I did not turn around, voice glacial. ‚ÄúNo. And don‚Äôt ever set foot here again.‚Äù

His breath caught‚Äîragged and uneven.

Just as the door shut behind him, I heard a whisper, faint as a dying flame:

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I had no intention of going back to that house full of lies‚Äî

But my mother‚Äôs things still waited for me there. I brought a moving crew with me, just in case.


I didn‚Äôt expect to walk into the living room‚Äîand find Vivienne giggling as she smeared bright paint across one of my mother‚Äôs last surviving sketches.

The canvas was ruined‚Äîjust smears of color and the echo of something precious, lost.

‚ÄúPut that down!‚Äù

I shouted so sharply she jumped, flinching like a child caught stealing.

Then she stumbled‚Äîconveniently‚Äîstraight into the easel.

Crash.

The last piece of my mother‚Äôs world shattered into splinters.

Vivienne scrambled up, slapped herself theatrically, like a child putting on a show, and then dropped to her knees‚Äîright on the one intact piece of the ruined stand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Helena! I didn‚Äôt mean to! I was upset and asked Sebastian to bring over some supplies to distract me. Please don‚Äôt be angry‚ÄîI‚Äôll buy you a whole new set, I promise!‚Äù

Rage blurred my vision.

My hand flew to the fruit knife on the coffee table‚Äîburning with the urge to carve her open.

I wanted to carve her open.

But before I could move, Sebastian stepped between us, holding me back.

‚ÄúThey were just some old drawings,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they matter so much, I‚Äôll get you perfect replicas.‚Äù

I stared at him, trembling with rage.

‚ÄúDo you even understand what you just said? That was all I had left of my mother.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù His voice faltered. ‚ÄúBut you destroyed Vivienne‚Äôs future. Isn‚Äôt that worth a few pieces of paper in return?‚Äù

My fingers clenched tighter around the knife.

‚ÄúYou think you get to touch anything that‚Äôs mine?!‚Äù

Before he could dodge, the blade grazed his hand‚Äînot deep, but enough for blood to fall in slow, steady drops.

It dripped steadily to the floor.

‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt hurt him!‚Äù Vivienne screamed, lunging forward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault‚Äîdon‚Äôt take it out on him! He‚Äôs a surgeon, his hands‚Äîhe needs his hands!‚Äù

I raised the knife again, this time heading straight for her face.

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Sebastian roared.

I didn‚Äôt.

He wrapped an arm around Vivienne and shoved me back with all his strength.

‚ÄúI said STOP!‚Äù My head slammed into the corner of the wall. Warmth spilled down my forehead‚Äîthick, sticky, red.

Sebastian froze, eyes wide with horror. He let go of Vivienne and rushed to my side, gathering me into his arms.

‚ÄúWhy do you always do this?‚Äù he muttered hoarsely. ‚ÄúYou throw yourself over the edge‚Äîjust to make me feel like the villain‚Ä¶ Is that what you want?‚Äù

The words slipped out of him like instinct.

But even he looked stunned at his own words.

Always?

Helena Whitmore was never the type to hurt herself for pity.

So why did he say it like this had happened before?

Chapter 6
I was barely conscious when they took me to the hospital.

Sebastian didn‚Äôt leave my side for three days.

When I finally woke up, he was sitting by my bed, quietly peeling an apple, his expression unreadable‚Äîthe weight in his silence heavier than anything I‚Äôd ever seen.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll marry you,‚Äù he said at last.

‚ÄúI never forgot the promise I made.‚Äù

I said nothing.

He held out a slice. ‚ÄúI said I‚Äôd protect you for life. I meant it.‚Äù

Then came the words that ruined it.

‚ÄúBut Vivienne‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt make things hard for her.‚Äù

I turned my head and pulled the blanket over my face, hiding the sting, hiding everything.

He stayed for a moment longer, watching me in silence.

Then he placed the apple on the nightstand and left.

I knew exactly where he was going‚Äîback to her.

That afternoon, I checked myself out.

Hat low, mask on, I disappeared into the airport crowd‚Äîalone.

I never expected him to come after me.

But just before boarding, Sebastian showed up, out of breath and eyes full of regret.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt protect you like I should have,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúWhatever happens from now on‚Ä¶ call me, okay?‚Äù

I glanced at him‚Äîjust briefly, caught off guard.

Then he pressed a card into my hand.

‚ÄúTake it‚Ä¶ an apology‚Ä¶ from your sister. She‚Äôs got a temper, but‚Ä¶ try to understand her, yeah?‚Äù

Did he seriously think I was Vivienne?

I nearly laughed out loud. The audacity. I slapped his hand away.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too late to undo the mess you made,‚Äù I said coldly.

Sebastian stepped closer.

‚ÄúI can help. New name. New passport. Just vanish for a while‚ÄìI‚Äôll cover it all.‚Äù

1mge1su,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mge1su/confidence_is_your_1_priority_if_you_have_no/,"Confidence Is Your #1 Priority! If You Have No Confidence, Forget Everything Else","Confidence is everything. If you have no confidence, there is no chance for you to get her. Think about it, if you were a girl, would you choose guy 1 who is a weak, wimpy, unconfident, not so smooth guy or would you prefer guy 2 who is laid back, chill, just go with the flow, smooth talker, funny, confident when he talks, when he jokes about himself he‚Äôs still smooth about it? If you‚Äôre honest with yourself, you know that all women will always choose guy 2. Why? Because guy 2 is confident. He feels like he deserves to be treated as so, so he is then treated as so. Confidence is everything. I will guarantee you that if you don‚Äôt have confidence at all to do anything, or to even fake it until you believe it, you will get nowhere. No amount of tips and tricks will help you get laid, get a girl to like you back, or just in general with any relationships. Confidence is very important because confidence is what makes you, you!

Most of the time, when I say most I mean all, all of your approaches, messages, the way you talk, the way you even move, the way you handle yourself, and just everything that you do and not do can be sensed by body language. Body language is energy. Just how you can sense something instinctively, women can sense it instinctively as well if you have confidence or you don‚Äôt have confidence. It‚Äôs a feel thing. When you experiment with approaches, messages, or whatever with women, confidence is the biggest factor that you can work on and what really works to get them. Looks will get you to the door, height will get you to the door, but if you don‚Äôt have confidence, you might as well just close them doors and just look back. This is why some guys are small and not so good looking but are dating the hottest chicks that you have ever seen. What‚Äôs the difference? Confidence. With confidence, you can mask all your not so good features. If you‚Äôre ugly, then work on your charms, make her laugh, and do it confidently. If you‚Äôre short, then work on your charms, make her laugh, and do it confidently. If you‚Äôre too tall, then work on your charms, make her laugh, and do it confidently. This is our superpower as a man. We can mask and hide our not so attractive features behind the confidence. That‚Äôs it. This is the reality. So if you have no confidence, then work on your confidence. Remember, it‚Äôs not what you say or what you do, it‚Äôs about how you do it.¬† Attraction is a psychological game. People are drawn to those who project an air of self-possession and purpose. You can even see this with someone that you like and are attracted to. It‚Äôs a psychological game. Do understand that confidence and true confidence isn‚Äôt just an act, but it‚Äôs also a strategic position that you can use to give yourself options. If you don‚Äôt think you can get her before you even approach her, then don‚Äôt even bother.¬†

# The Mindset (Foundation)

The first step to building confidence is understanding that it's a byproduct, not a goal. You first have to look at yourself and be honest with yourself that you are not confident. You have to look inward and to actually look at yourself. The only way to truly become better is to first admit that you are weak and are lacking at that subject, to be humbled by it, so then you can allow yourself to open up and receive new knowledge. This goes to every aspect of skills, knowledge, and everything along those lines. You must first admit that there is a problem so you can then open yourself up to fix the problem. It‚Äôs simple but it's deeper and more complex than that, but that is the first step.

Understand that men who lack confidence are often stuck in a needy, validation-seeking mindset. It‚Äôs the old adage of **""Nice Guy""** syndrome. Nice guys always finish last for a reason, because these nice guys forget that being a ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù is not the same as being a ‚ÄúGood Guy‚Äù. These are two entirely different things. Nice guys believes that if they are ""good enough"", if he only do everything that she says she wants, being there all the time to the point of smothering her, that only then a woman will validate their worth. This is a false idea. This will always result into failure. My counter idea for that is, if what you have been doing has not been working and it gets you a result that you don‚Äôt like, then won‚Äôt that mean that what you have been doing and that idea is then wrong? That approach is fundamentally flawed. As **David Deida** teaches in *The Way of the Superior Man*, a man's core is his purpose, his mission in life. Women are neurologically and evolutionarily drawn to a man who has a clear, non-negotiable mission, not one who makes her his mission. Women want a guy who knows what he wants, and if it comes to a point that he is given to choose to pick between her and his goals, then he would leave the girl to focus on his goals. That is the masculine man. It doesn‚Äôt mean to be rude, mean, cruel, or anything, but it means that if it comes to a point that his woman doesn;t benefit him because she is rude all the time, disrespects him, then he would just politely say his goodbyes, walkaway, and never look back. This focus on your purpose, from your career, your fitness, your passions, whatever it may be as long as it‚Äôs your goal, is a signal to the world that your worth is intrinsic and not dependent on anyone else. It's the most powerful, attractive frame you can possess, and it's the only one that can't be taken away from you. This gives you confidence and this confidence is like an inner light that radiates the world, and the world, through women, can see it and they are attracted by it.

# The Practical Application (Strategy)

Building confidence isn't a single event; it‚Äôs a series of small, daily actions. This is your field manual: Just how droplets of water broke through a rock. It‚Äôs not through a one-time pressure or motivation, or a random burst, but it‚Äôs from years of continuous, relentless, disciplined, consistent attack. What you do now may not make sense and may feel like nothing, but you‚Äôll be glad you did it if you stay consistent because you are the droplet of water. Stay consistent and follow the list.

1. **Conquer Your Daily Mission.** Every morning, before you check your phone, write down three critical tasks you need to accomplish that day. Once you write these down, you can back up and not do it. Just like I said, if you want to be confident, then you have to do the work. Don‚Äôt be weak and give up and say that you‚Äôre tired or scared or whatever excuse you say to yourself. Once you write it down, you stop whatever you‚Äôre doing and you do it. You wrote it down, so you do it. Don‚Äôt be that type of guy who says something then you don‚Äôt do it. No woman and no man will like you that way. Be a man and get moving. Your success in your day to day life is a representation of how successful you‚Äôll be in your dating and work life. It‚Äôs interconnected. If you are successful in one thing, then it‚Äôll transfer to the next one. This is why I emphasize the importance of discipline. You do good at one thing, then you‚Äôll feel great, then you‚Äôll feel confident to do other things. It‚Äôs a domino effect from there. Your success in dating is a byproduct of your success in life. Completing these tasks builds a compounding cycle of small victories, proving to yourself that you are a man of action.
2. **Practice Honest Expression.** Most men lack confidence because they are afraid of rejection and they try to be what they think a woman wants. This creates a weak, inauthentic frame. Why? Because you are not being you. **Mark Manson's** ***Models*** champions radical honesty. Instead of filtering your thoughts, practice stating your opinion respectfully but without hesitation. For example, if you don't like a movie she recommends, say ""I'm not really into that kind of movie, but I love \[a different genre\]. Let's try that instead."" This shows you are a man with standards and opinions, and it immediately builds a more solid frame. If you like blue, and she says she likes red, then don‚Äôt go back and forth and pretend to like red because she likes red. Instead, make it a more fun and engaging interaction instead. Don‚Äôt like what she likes, go like what you like. If there is differences, then have a friendly debate, or turn it into a fun back and forth. The idea is to be true to yourself.
3. **Master Your Non-Verbal Presence.** Long before a word is spoken, your body language communicates your frame. How you think and perceive yourself becomes true. If you think that you are confident, then you magically become confident. If you think that you will be rejected when you approach that woman, somehow you also magically get rejected too. **Neil Strauss** and **Dave Perrotta** both emphasize the power of non-verbal cues. Stand tall with your shoulders back. Make strong, steady eye contact. Don't fidget. Stand tall, but not too tall. Confident, but not too confident. Be sweet, be smooth. These actions are not tricks. It‚Äôs you faking it until you believe it and they are physical expressions of a man who is comfortable and confident in his own skin. Practice this daily in small interactions, like ordering coffee or walking down the street.
4. **Approach Levels.** Practice and do these 100 times this month. Practice these steps accordingly and practice with all women. Regardless of whether you are attracted to the woman or not, do each step 100 times before you move to the next step. **Level 1** Practice making eye contact and smiling at women. **Level 2** Practice asking ‚ÄòHi, How are you?‚Äô. **Level 3** Practice asking a question or say a genuine compliment after asking ‚ÄòHi, How are you?‚Äô. **Level 4** Practice going back and forth and hold a conversation for 5 minutes. **Level 5** Practice asking her for her contact details, Instagram, Facebook, messages, etc. **Level 6** Practice asking for a date on the spot after seeing that her attraction to you is high and all¬† the subtle signs are there. You can go and practice these practically anywhere. You can do it on cafes, department stores, supermarkets, parks, places you‚Äôll never show up ever again and where you will not be remembered. The key idea is to do the numbers. It‚Äôs all about the numbers. These are guaranteed to get your confidence back. Try these steps out for yourself. Have fun with it. If you have no confidence, try starting with making eye contact with women and smiling at them. Remember to not be creepy or look rude. Be genuine about it.

# The Escalation & Repetition (The Long Game)

Confidence is not a switch you flip; it‚Äôs a muscle you strengthen through repetition. It‚Äôs all about the numbers. Each time you implement the steps above, you're building courage, not just confidence. It will not make sense now, but if you trust me with these and you follow through especially the 100 approaches, I will guarantee that you will get laid in 2 months. I have done this myself and this is what I personally did to overcome interacting with women. This is the essence of **Robert Greene's** ***The 50th Law***: the only way to overcome fear is to confront it repeatedly until it loses its power over you. Your long-term strategy is to make these actions habits.

* **Daily Repetition:** Check in on your purpose-driven tasks every day. Do what you wrote down. Do at least 3 of the approach levels.
* **Weekly Action:** Once a week, force yourself into a social situation where you can practice your honest expression and strong body language. This could be a new coffee shop, a hobby group, or a networking event. If you have been following the tasks religiously, then by the end of the week you can confidently increase the difficulty as so.
* **Monthly Review:** Reflect on your progress. How has your confidence grown? Where do you need to focus more? Is there any changes on how you interact with women?

# Case Study

Mike, a 28-year-old software developer, was a classic ""Nice Guy"" who lacked confidence. He‚Äôd spend hours on dating apps and get frustrated with the lack of results. Instead of wildly swiping through dating apps to find a girl, we shifted his focus on his goals instead. We shifted his focus away from dating and onto his purpose at the time, hitting the gym consistently for a month. We then added a daily discipline of honest expression, of him to know what he wants and what he doesn‚Äôt want. He started telling his friends what he really thought and stood up for his opinions at work, the right strategies that he thinks would work best at work or his true opinion in a conversation when he was asked about it. We also did 3 approaches a day. Just started with three approaches and he was comfortable with only doing simple ‚Äúhi, hello, good morning‚Äôs‚Äù and holding eye contact so we did that for 2 weeks, 3 a day. The change was slow at first, but after a few months, his posture naturally straightened, he feels better, he has been hitting goals, his eye contact became steady, he simply stopped caring so much about outcomes, and he feels better and less scared to go and ask a cute girls number 3 seconds in the first time he sees her. He was so engaged in his life that he didn't need external validation. This powerful, purpose-driven frame made him naturally more attractive, and women started to notice him without him even trying.

# Conclusion

Remember these key takeaways:

* **Your purpose is your frame.** It's the source of your masculine energy and unshakable confidence.
* **Small, daily actions build an unshakeable foundation.** Consistently conquer your daily mission and practice honest expression. Your 3 tasks, your 3 approaches.
* **Confidence is a byproduct of consistent courage.** It's a state you earn through action.

Stop trying to be what you think women want. Start building a life so compelling that they naturally want to be a part of it. This is your daily mission.

  
TLDR confidence its the foundation of you as a person in the relationship. man or woman, trying to do pickup, dating, or the relationship stage, confidence is what will make the other person attracted to you and what will make you feel better as a person",0,1754209396.0,relationships,0,0.5,False
1mge1pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mge1pm/i_live_in_a_state_that_does_not_exist/,I Live In A State That Does Not Exist,"Let me get this out of the way: my state *does* exist. I mean, how else would I be typing this? But you‚Äôve probably never heard of it. Or at least, you don‚Äôt remember.¬†

I live in the state of Sequoyah. The proud 38th state to join the United States of America. Tucked between Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We formally joined the Union in 1868, right after the ratification of the 14th Amendment.

Before that, Sequoyah was an independent Cherokee Indian reservation.

But protected reservations don‚Äôt pay taxes, and the war-torn South wasn‚Äôt gonna pay for itself. So the U.S. snatched up the land, and just like that, Sequoyah was born. Everyone living here got labeled a tax-eligible citizen.

This probably sounds insane to all of you, but I‚Äôve lived here my whole life. We‚Äôre being erased. Not metaphorically. I mean nobody outside of Sequoyah has any evidence we were ever here.

I started noticing a change about a year ago.

The capital city, Gist, sits right near the point where Tennessee, Georgia, and Sequoyah meet. Because of that, we used to get a steady stream of tourists; mostly folks from further south coming up to see the leaves change and stare at the mountains.

But then the tourists started thinning out. And the ones who *did* show up always looked lost. Like they didn‚Äôt know how they got here or what this place even was.¬†

I was working a shift at my aunt‚Äôs coffeehouse, *Gist a Sip*, when a lady walked in. She looked about my age, early 20s, with a confused look on her face.

‚ÄúWelcome to Gist a Sip! Take a seat and I‚Äôll be right with you,‚Äù I said, going through my usual customer service routine.

‚ÄúActually, I was just hoping to get directions,‚Äù she said, kind of glancing around. ‚ÄúThis place isn‚Äôt on my GPS.‚Äù

I figured she had to be mistaken. I mean, this is Gist. The capital of Sequoyah. We‚Äôre not Atlanta, but we‚Äôre definitely not some middle-of-nowhere ghost town either.

‚ÄúHuh, odd,‚Äù I said, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it as I walked over. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in Gist. Where are you trying to get to?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, where is Gist? I‚Äôm supposed to be in North Carolina right now.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about an hour out. This is Sequoyah.‚Äù

Her face dropped, like she thought she misheard me.

‚ÄúSequoyah? What is that?‚Äù



I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes.

‚ÄúIs that a joke?‚Äù I was genuinely asking, but her face told me it wasn‚Äôt.

I pointed to the map on the wall. ‚ÄúNo disrespect, but nobody‚Äôs ever asked me that before. Are you from out of the country?‚Äù I tried to keep it light.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Savannah,‚Äù she said, still looking shaken.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from Georgia and you don‚Äôt know about the state right above you?‚Äù I cracked a smile, still trying to be nice. ‚ÄúNot so sure you should be traveling alone.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt smile back.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no state called Sequoyah. I should be in North Carolina right now. Look.‚Äù

She pulled out her phone and showed me her GPS. It looked like it was glitching. Constantly rerouting, stuttering like it was looking for roads that didn‚Äôt exist. And sure enough, Sequoyah wasn‚Äôt on the map. Tennessee touched North Carolina directly, like someone had cropped us out in a bad Photoshop.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. Your GPS must be glitching or something. Here, take a seat and we‚Äôll pour you some coffee and get you a map.‚Äù I tried to be courteous. She was visibly shaken, and her eyes were darting around like she was looking for an exit. I needed her to calm down before she scared the other customers.

She thanked me, and I sat down beside her to help her work through the map. She looked like she was trying to read a foreign language.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked, starting to wonder if maybe she wasn‚Äôt mentally well.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ally,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúHi Ally, I‚Äôm Brenda,‚Äù I responded with a smile. ‚ÄúAre you feeling okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶ but this is all impossible.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

I guess I know better now but imagine being told your entire state didn‚Äôt exist and you shouldn‚Äôt be there. What would you have said?

‚ÄúIs there someone I should call for you? Any friends or family? I‚Äôm worried about you getting back on the road like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah. I can call my mom.‚Äù She pulled out her phone and dialed. Then she put it on speaker.

A cheery voice came through the speaker.

‚ÄúHey Ally, how‚Äôs the trip? Did you get there okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, what states border Georgia?‚Äù she asked, frantically. I thought hopefully her mom could talk some sense into her.

‚ÄúWell... there‚Äôs Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. What‚Äôs this about?‚Äù

I looked down at the phone like her mom could feel the glare I was giving through it.

Ally‚Äôs face sank even further as she looked back at me.

‚ÄúWhat about Sequoyah?‚Äù I said into the phone, confident that this family just sucked at geography.

‚ÄúSequoyah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù the woman on the other end asked.

Ally looked up at me, clearly feeling vindicated. I could tell she didn‚Äôt trust me anymore.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶ I got turned around and ended up in a town I don‚Äôt recognize. My GPS isn‚Äôt working. They‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm in a state called Sequoyah. I was just in Georgia. I should be in North Carolina right now. Mom, this isn‚Äôt making any sense. Where am I?‚Äù

She was starting to spiral.

I tried to calm things down. Other customers were starting to look her way.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt understand. You‚Äôre in the state of Sequoyah, in the town of Gist. I want to help you, but you need to try to stay calm.‚Äù

I debated calling 911. This woman clearly needed to be evaluated. Her mom backing her up wasn‚Äôt helping.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny!‚Äù she said, fighting tears. ‚ÄúI know I crossed the Georgia border. I know I should be in North Carolina right now. You‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm in a state that doesn‚Äôt even exist!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I pulled out my ID. ‚ÄúLook, this is a Sequoyah state ID. If you go outside, you‚Äôll see Sequoyah license plates on almost every car. Sequoyah‚Äôs been a real state for over 100 years.‚Äù

It was no use. She ran out of the coffee shop and got into her car. She sped off down the road, the map still spread out on the table where she left it.

I took a second to catch my breath. I‚Äôve had some weird customers before, but that was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.

Except it kept happening.

My best friend Will worked at the old gift shop down the street. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúYou Get the Gist.‚Äù We really like our puns around here.

Anyway, he had to find a new job a couple months ago when the business suddenly shut down. Delivery orders just stopped coming in. When they called the supplier, they said all the orders were getting returned with an invalid address. The supplier insisted they didn‚Äôt know a city called Gist and were sure there was no state called Sequoyah.

There haven‚Äôt been many tourists lately. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the last time I served coffee to a face I didn‚Äôt recognize.

I saw a news article the other day about a missing woman. It was Ally, the same woman from the coffee shop about a year ago. She left home for a trip up north and never made it. Reportedly, she made hundreds of calls to friends and family trying to get help. The investigation went cold when detectives couldn‚Äôt trace any of her calls to a real location.

I decided to call the tipline. They told me I should be ashamed for making prank calls to a missing persons hotline.

So, this is my last resort. I‚Äôm writing this in case anyone out there can tell me what the hell is going on.

Do you remember Sequoyah?

And if you‚Äôre from Sequoyah reading this, please help explain to these people that I‚Äôm not crazy. There are hundreds of thousands of us here, but according to the world outside our borders, we don‚Äôt exist.

I used to say that a lot.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it under control.‚Äù

Every time someone got too close, every time I looked too thin, too tired, too distant, that was my go-to. Because I wanted to believe it. And honestly? For a while, I did.

I was still working. Still cracking jokes. Still showing up to dinner with my family. But I was also counting pills in my pocket during conversations, calculating how long I could stretch what I had left.

Control? That was long gone. I just hadn‚Äôt admitted it yet.

The moment it hit me wasn‚Äôt dramatic. No flashing lights. No overdose. I just woke up one day and realized the first thing I thought about wasn‚Äôt coffee or work or even brushing my teeth, it was, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my next dose?‚Äù

That‚Äôs not control. That‚Äôs survival. Barely.

I used to look down on addicts, I hate saying that, but it‚Äôs true. I told myself I was different because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthat bad.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt on the street. I had a job. I had goals.

# Best iPad Screen Protector 2025: Top Reviews & Guide

Choosing the right screen protector for your iPad is crucial in 2025. With advancements in display technology and everyday use becoming more demanding, protecting your investment from scratches, smudges, and even cracks is more meaningful than ever. This guide will explore some of the top-rated iPad screen protectors available, providing extensive reviews and key considerations to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the best iPad screen protector requires careful consideration of various features and how they align with your specific needs.**Material Quality**

The material used in a screen protector significantly impacts its durability and performance. Tempered glass protectors are generally more resistant to scratches and impacts than plastic film protectors. High-end tempered glass protectors often undergo additional treatments for increased strength and clarity. These treatments can include multiple layers of specialized coatings to enhance scratch resistance, shatterproof properties, and overall clarity. The quality of the adhesive also plays a role; a good adhesive will prevent bubbles and ensure the protector stays firmly in place.

**Transparency and Clarity**

A high-quality screen protector should maintain the original display's clarity and color accuracy. Look for protectors with a high transparency rating, typically expressed as a percentage. Protectors advertised as ""HD clear"" or ""ultra-clear"" are designed to maximize light transmission and minimize distortion. Some protectors may have an anti-glare coating, which can reduce reflections but might slightly impact the display's sharpness. Evaluate whether prioritizing clarity or anti-glare is more important based on your typical usage environment.**Touch Sensitivity**

The thickness and composition of the screen protector can affect touch sensitivity. A thinner protector generally provides better touch response, but it may offer less protection against impacts. Tempered glass protectors should be designed to maintain responsiveness, ensuring that touch inputs are accurately registered. Look for protectors that specifically mention compatibility with Apple Pencil or other stylus pens, as these are usually optimized for precise input.**Installation Process**

A user-kind installation process is crucial for avoiding bubbles, dust particles, and misalignment. Many screen protectors come with an installation kit that includes cleaning wipes, dust removal stickers, and an alignment frame. The alignment frame helps to precisely position the protector on the iPad screen. Some protectors feature self-adhesive properties that automatically expel air bubbles during installation. Read reviews and watch installation videos to get a sense of how easy or challenging the process is.

**Durability and Scratch Resistance**

The hardness rating, measured on the Mohs scale, indicates a screen protector's resistance to scratches. Most tempered glass protectors have a hardness rating of 9H,meaning they can withstand scratches from keys,coins,and other common objects. However, even with a 9H rating, the protector can still be scratched by harder materials like sand or diamond. Consider the level of protection you need based on your typical usage and environment. For instance, if you frequently use your iPad outdoors or in dusty environments, a more scratch-resistant protector may be essential.

**Oleophobic Coating**

An oleophobic coating repels oils and fingerprints,making the screen easier to clean and reducing smudges. This coating is typically applied to tempered glass protectors and can degrade over time with use.Look for protectors with a durable oleophobic coating that is designed to last. The effectiveness of the coating can vary between brands and models, so reading reviews can provide insights into real-world performance.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right iPad screen protector provides several key benefits, enhancing both the longevity and usability of your device.

**Protection Against Damage:** A quality screen protector acts as a shield against everyday hazards such as scratches from keys, accidental drops, and the general wear and tear of daily use.This protection helps maintain the pristine condition of your iPad's screen, preserving its resale value.

**enhanced Screen Clarity and Visibility:** Premium screen protectors are designed to maintain the original clarity of your iPad's display.The anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings employed in these protectors ensure that the screen remains visible even in radiant lighting conditions, preventing distractions during use. This is notably beneficial for users who frequently use their iPads outdoors or in environments with strong overhead lighting.

**Improved Device Longevity:** By safeguarding the iPad's screen from damage,a screen protector contributes to the overall longevity of the device. Scratches and cracks not only detract from the aesthetic appeal but can also impact the functionality of the touch screen,diminishing the user experience over time. Investing in a good screen protector is, thus, a proactive measure to extend the device's lifespan and maintain its optimal performance.

**Reduced Maintenance and Cleaning:** Screen protectors with oleophobic coatings repel fingerprints and smudges, resulting in a cleaner screen that requires less frequent cleaning. This reduces the time and effort needed to maintain the screen's appearance.

**Preservation of Resale Value:** Keeping the screen in perfect condition is crucial for preserving the iPad's resale value. A device with a pristine screen commands a higher price in the used market, making the initial investment in a quality screen protector a worthwhile expenditure in the long run.

## FAQs Section

**Will a screen protector affect the touch sensitivity of my iPad?**
A high-quality screen protector should not significantly affect the touch sensitivity of your iPad. Look for protectors specifically designed to maintain responsiveness. Thinner protectors generally provide better touch sensitivity, particularly with Apple Pencil usage.

**What's the difference between tempered glass and plastic film screen protectors?**
tempered glass protectors offer superior protection against scratches and impacts compared to plastic film protectors. They also provide greater clarity and a smoother feel. Plastic film protectors are typically thinner and less expensive,but they offer less durable protection.

**How do I prevent bubbles when installing a screen protector?**
To prevent bubbles, start with a clean screen. Use the provided cleaning wipes to remove dust and smudges. An alignment frame can help you position the protector accurately. Apply the protector slowly, working from one edge to the other, and use a squeegee or credit card to gently press out any air bubbles.

**Does the screen protector come with a warranty?**
Warranty coverage varies by brand and product. Check the product description for data on warranty duration and coverage. Some manufacturers offer limited lifetime warranties, while others provide shorter warranty periods for defects in materials or workmanship.

1mgdz43,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mgdz43/my_mother_wont_stop_buying_things_from_online_ads/,my mother won't stop buying things from online ads,"When I got the news of Mom getting into an accident, I dropped everything to make the five-hour drive home from college back to our hometown to be there for her. The dingy, unkempt small town hospital stank of antiseptic, and the annoyed nurses finally gave in to my incessant begging to see Mom only after interrupting their gossip at the nurses‚Äô station for the fifth time. To my great relief, she was in much better condition than my frantic sister had led me to believe during our midnight phone call, which had alerted me to the situation.   
  
There she was, a small heap of thin linen sheets and hospital gowns crumpled up under a precariously shaky table tray of bland cafeteria food. I‚Äôd never thought about Mom‚Äôs mortality before, taking for granted that she would always be there to welcome me home on school holidays or send money for my birthday. So when I finally saw her after that long trip home, panicking at every thought that the world was without one more comforting hug, I teared up.   
  
‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù Mom asked, looking annoyed. ‚ÄúDid you come home over this? You‚Äôve got school to worry about; you didn‚Äôt have to come all this way over this rubbish.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I choked, coming to her bedside, ‚ÄúVanessa said you had to stay overnight in the hospital. I came as soon as I heard about it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, my God,‚Äù She groaned, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúYour sister is so overdramatic, along with all these doctors. I‚Äôm fine! Some asshole didn‚Äôt know how to use his blinker on the freeway, and we got in a little accident.‚Äù  
  
Seeing that my mother was in absolutely no danger at all, full of her usual vim and vinegar, my misty eyes all but absorbed my tears back like a sponge. While I was flooded with relief, I couldn‚Äôt help but fall back into our old talking habits.  
  
‚ÄúYour car was flipped over,‚Äù I said dryly, ‚ÄúThe firefighters had to cut you out. Vanessa sent me the pictures.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSo my hip is a little fractured, so what?!‚Äù Mom flung her hands up in frustration. ‚ÄúI want to get back to doing things, I refuse to sit around and be waited on hand and foot like some layabout!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBad news for you, then,‚Äù I chuckled, pulling forward one of the chairs in the room to sit at her bedside. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be a layabout for at least a few months, unless you decide to try riding horseback tomorrow. Then you‚Äôll probably be a layabout for a year.‚Äù

Mom visibly deflated. The entire time I had conscious memory of her, she had never been one to sit still. Always the type to be worrying about one thing or stressing over the next, my childhood was a flurry of her darting from room to room with one project or another. One summer it was all about home-canning pickled goods and meat, the next winter would be learning how to make (ugly) clothes for me and my sister, and then in spring it would be plans for going on family outings. It wasn‚Äôt until my early high school years that I had the lazy pleasure of visiting a friend's house to play a video game or watch the latest episode of Survivor. Television, much less wireless internet, had never played a role in my life. It‚Äôd been something of a culture shock going to college and realizing pen and paper were not considered sufficient note-taking tools. I had never seen Mom enjoy a show or log into an email. Even the TV in her hospital room, coated with a thick layer of dust, was a silent obelisk with the remote nowhere in sight. Watching her sulk, knowing how miserable she thought her life was going to be for the next few months, I decided a small sacrifice was in order.

I pardoned myself to my car, then quickly returned with a thin device and a small black box. Mom was way overdue to get familiar with modern technology, and I decided that the iPad I had gotten for school but never used was the perfect introduction. It took an embarrassingly long time to explain how to use it, and that the black box was a magical device called a ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù for endless connectivity. After several long, exhausting hours of repeated explanations combined with the drive to get there, I was ready to pass out. As I got up to leave, a passing nurse shot me a glare of disdain from the hallway. I felt a tug at my sleeve.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about this, honey,‚Äù Mom murmured, showing an unusually vulnerable expression of discomfort. ‚ÄúThis sort of thing isn‚Äôt really me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Mom,‚Äù I patted her hand, giving her a half-hearted smile of reassurance. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôll make a deal with you,‚Äù

I thought for a moment about what I could promise her to make her look forward to recovery, something that would make her stay still long enough to ensure she wouldn‚Äôt get hurt again.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre better,‚Äù I grinned, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶ take you white water rafting?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fan of that,‚Äù Mom rolled her eyes.

‚ÄúOkay, then, mountain climbing. We‚Äôll put your healed hip to the test.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a deal.‚Äù She scoffed, nodding. With that, I leaned over the bed to kiss her forehead and poked her screen to turn on a random YouTube video to get her started.

The rest of my night was uneventful. Returning to my childhood home, the only things I was interested in were a shower and my bed. In the morning, Vanessa greeted me on the way out of her bedroom, her matching satin pajamas putting my old holey t-shirt and shorts to shame. We sat down for breakfast after I cooked using what ingredients I could scrounge from the old, noisy fridge. In the daylight, I could appreciate the coziness of Mom‚Äôs home. Clean and well-kept, lived in but not untidy. It smelled of her perfume, with family photos crammed into every inch of the walls; all our memories were on display. It was a good childhood, I decided, even if Crash Bandicoot or Spyro didn‚Äôt exist for me at the time.

‚ÄúDo you think we should tell Dad?‚Äù Vanessa quietly probed over her cup of coffee and my awful attempt at a basic cheese omelet.

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù I balked, stifling a laugh of disbelief, ‚ÄúWhat does that prick have to do with any of this?‚Äù

Our parents hadn‚Äôt been married since I was a baby. With Vanessa, a few years older than I, she at least had vague memories of a happy home. All I knew was that he was a cheating scumbag who didn‚Äôt deserve someone as badass as Mom. I‚Äôd had visitation, but was never interested in keeping contact. Vanessa, on the other hand, had kept up some semblance of a relationship with him.

‚ÄúCome on, don‚Äôt you keep tabs on your exes?‚Äù She asked, ‚ÄúEven if they haven‚Äôt been together for a long time, wouldn‚Äôt you want to know if something like this happened to someone you cared about at one point?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, you can tell him,‚Äù I waved my hand dismissively, shoveling an undercooked egg into my mouth. ‚ÄúJust leave me out of it. Mom doesn‚Äôt need the stress or drama right now, anyway.‚Äù

I decided to stay home to make the house ‚Äúbroken-hip ready‚Äù while my mother underwent surgery and physical therapy in the hospital. Thankfully, I could take college classes from my laptop, meaning it wasn‚Äôt a big deal to miss out on school for the time being. Vanessa left on the third day; she had her own life to get back to, and her law office was far less forgiving than my university. It was when I was sweeping away freshly cut grass clippings off the front porch that a grumpy delivery driver scuttled up the front walkway, dropped off a package, and then scurried away halfway through my hello. Shrugging off their quick departure, I picked up and inspected the small box in my hands. It was addressed to Mom.

The significance wasn‚Äôt lost on me that this was the first thing she had ever placed an order for online, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of pride that she was able to get this far on her own. Setting it inside on the breakfast table where I knew she would find it later, I returned to my chore list.

By the time my mother was able to return home, a few packages were waiting for her. As I eased her into her armchair, she bade me bring them to her. Like a Christmas morning, I watched eagerly as she opened the packages to reveal completely unexciting new items. A brand new mop and bucket that used more technology than necessary, a subscription box for a company selling succulents, a knitting machine with yarn, and the first, smallest box I had seen, a deck of playing cards.

‚ÄúGetting into gambling now, Mom?‚Äù I joked as she set them aside.

‚ÄúOh, well, I thought I might get into solitaire, or play with you for the meantime. They were running a deal online.‚Äù She shrugged, smiling at me. I set up the TV for her, having set up her internet only the day before, and went off to do more work around the house.

The next few days, more packages started to arrive. Groceries from the local superstore megachain were purchased using the ‚Äúplus membership‚Äù services. A revolutionary workout device that rotates your abdominals. Old Spice body washes.

‚ÄúMom, why did you even get these?‚Äù I asked, holding up the red packages of fragrances like ‚ÄúFiji‚Äù and ‚ÄúBearglove,‚Äù whatever that‚Äôs supposed to smell like. Mom chuckled, looking shy.

‚ÄúWell, I found these old commercials online featuring that handsome Terry Crews, I just thought I‚Äôd support him since he seems like such a nice, young man.‚Äù She admitted with a blush. I rolled my eyes, but hey, who didn‚Äôt have a crush on that guy?

When the doorbell rang the next day, I opened it to see the same delivery driver as before, dark bags sagging below his eyes, using a truck dolly to wheel in a massive package.

‚ÄúWhoa, you sure that‚Äôs for us?‚Äù I chuckled nervously, looking up and down the sheer size of it. The driver stared at me, shoving a clipboard into my chest with more force than necessary.  
  
‚ÄúSign here,‚Äù He muttered. Perplexed, I did as he asked. He dropped off the package on the front porch and went back to his truck. Closing the door behind me, I paused for a moment, processing the interaction before going back to the living room.  
  
‚ÄúWho was that, honey?‚Äù Mom asked, not looking up from scrolling on her phone. She‚Äôd stayed mostly in the same armchair since coming home, making it easy to find her when she wasn‚Äôt using the hospital-issued walker to get to and from the bathroom.   
  
‚ÄúDelivery guy, he seemed to be in a bad mood for some reason. Hey, did you order something really big?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Mom straightened excitedly, ‚ÄúThat must be the new fridge I ordered! Would you set it up for me?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou ordered a new fridge?‚Äù I asked, surprised. Well, the one she had now was pretty noisy and several years old. Maybe the din was annoying to her, sitting fairly close to the kitchen as she was. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I can pull that thing in here on my own.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt you worry about that! I ordered some of those LD-1000 furniture moving straps. Just ask the delivery man to help you move it in.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMom, I don‚Äôt think the delivery driver will help--‚Äù  
  
As I began to protest, the doorbell rang. I quickly went to open the door, finding the same person holding a dozen more packages on his moving dolly.   
  
‚ÄúCan you just leave the door open?‚Äù He grumbled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a couple loads of these to drop off.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúWhoa, whoa-- just-- can you hold on a second?‚Äù I asked, bewildered. Leaving the door open, I moved back to the living room. ‚ÄúMom, just how many things did you order?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, I lost count,‚Äù She waved me off. ‚ÄúJust have the young man leave the boxes inside, you can bring them to me later. What did he say about helping you move the fridge?‚Äù   
  
Stunned, I stuttered over some words that I couldn‚Äôt quite get through before the man at the door made his way inside, he glanced at me with a shrug before dropping off a heap of packages, and then returned to his truck only to come back with another stack he left inside the door. In my shock, I stopped him long enough to borrow the same truck dolly, wheeling in the new fridge to the kitchen before he stomped out of the house. The small flurry of activity done, I was left in the entryway staring at the double towers of packages.   
  
‚ÄúBring them over!‚Äù Mom called to me, sounding excited. Without a word, I started bringing over the boxes one by one. What was once a fun Christmas ritual now felt heavier. The first box of furniture moving straps set aside, she opened the next one to reveal a high-quality cat litter proven to change colors with the cats urine based on their health. As she grinned at the open package with wide eyes, turning it over in her hands, I spoke up.  
  
‚ÄúMom, you don‚Äôt own a cat.‚Äù   
  
As soon as the words left my mouth, her head jerked back and she shot a glare at me. Holding the package with clenched fists, her nostrils flared in anger.  
  
‚ÄúSo?‚Äù She huffed, ‚ÄúIt was a good deal, and I was thinking of getting a cat, anyway. This would be perfect to set it up, don‚Äôt you think? I also got a self-cleaning litter box, so I was going to ask if you could go pick up a cat at the shelter for me.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take care of an animal right now, Mom. You can‚Äôt even take care of yourself right now. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt ask for you to stay here, now did I?‚Äù She snarled. I went quiet as she set aside the package of litter to open the next box. True to her word, it was a self-cleaning robotic litter box. Then it was a bulk package of Himalayan pink salt, a fan that goes around your neck, an organizer with built-in USB ports to charge devices, an ugly cooler that was considered better than other coolers because this one had wheels, a countertop hydroponic garden, and a luxury bag that claimed to fit more luggage than other bags on the market. Each opened box was a delighted squeal before she set it aside on a growing pile of purchases. The entire time I sat, feeling hurt and unsure of what to say to her. Once she was done, she went right back to scrolling her ipad, all while the TV in front of her played reruns of old shows and her phone charging next to her.   
  
I moved back to the kitchen and set about the task of taking everything out of the old fridge, unplugging it, and stuffing the new one back in its place. As I refilled the new fridge with some of the goods she‚Äôd had delivered from her grocery store membership, I realized just how much of it there was. Branded products I‚Äôd never seen her use in her life before, vegan non-meat patties stuffed next to the cheapest, 100% angus beef hamburger steaks and organic lemons mingling with unopened bottles of lemon juice concentrate. I glanced at the old fridge as I closed the doors of the new one, which had been beeping loudly to remind me it was still open. Poking my head around the corner, I could see mom bundled up on her armchair, giggling over a video and looking small.   
  
She‚Äôs just cranky because she can‚Äôt get up and move, I thought, dismissing my hurt. She didn‚Äôt mean it. She hadn‚Äôt, had she? Licking my lips in consideration and glancing again at the old fridge that, until now, had worked just fine for her, I decided I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to do her any more favors today. Grabbing my jacket and my keys, I made my way to the front door with a call over my shoulder that I‚Äôd be going for a walk.   
  
Mom didn‚Äôt reply.  
  
Making my way around the neighborhood, I stopped while leaning against the white picket fence of one of the others in the middle-upper-class area. I pulled out my phone, dialing Vanessa‚Äôs number.  
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù She asked as she picked up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at work, so I can‚Äôt talk long.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah, I figured, sorry,‚Äù I sighed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just-- I‚Äôm calling about mom.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhy? Is everything okay?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, her hip is fine, she‚Äôs just tired all the time.‚Äù I paused, running my fingers through my hair as my eyes traced the power lines cutting across the otherwise beautiful open air. A mark of human need in an otherwise perfect picture. ‚ÄúHey, has mom ever talked to you about wanting a cat?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAre you planning to get Mom an animal? That‚Äôs probably not a good idea until she‚Äôs at least mobile, but it might be nice for her to have a companion.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, has she ever told you she wanted one, herself?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù She replied, sounding surprised. ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs more of a dog person.‚Äù  
  
I didn‚Äôt say anything for a moment, mulling over this new piece of information. Thinking on it, Vanessa‚Äôs right. Mom never showed any interest in cats. As long as I‚Äôd known her, she‚Äôd always stopped every passerby with a dog to ask permission to say hello, and fawned over every poodle and labrador at the park.  
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this about?‚Äù Vanessa asked, ‚ÄúIs that all you called to ask me?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, um,‚Äù I shook my head free of my thoughts. ‚ÄúSomething weird‚Äôs going on. Mom keeps ordering a bunch of stuff online.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a good thing; it‚Äôs about time she got with the modern age.‚Äù In the background, I could hear a co-worker asking Vanessa something inaudible. She replied to them, then came back to the phone. ‚ÄúSorry, I gotta go.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I cut in quickly, ‚ÄúI have to leave in a few days to take an exam back at school; they won‚Äôt let me do it online. Do you think you could come watch Mom while I‚Äôm gone?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can. There‚Äôs a case coming up that I have to be present for, I have to take care of my clients. Mom‚Äôll be fine for a few days, she texted me to let me know she can walk around a bit more now.‚Äù Another interruption from someone else. I heard Vanessa swear quietly away from the phone. ‚ÄúOkay, I have to leave. You got this, love you.‚Äù  
  
With a click, the phone call was ended. I was left staring down at my phone screen at the last thing I‚Äôd been looking at online, a new set of pens for my schoolwork. My stomach twisted as I glanced back up the path that would lead me back home. In the distance, I could see storm clouds lazily making their way in the direction of town, set to ruin what I thought was going to be a sunny day. Closing the order I had been intending to make, I returned to the house with my gaze fixed on the sidewalk.   
  
The few days before I had to go back to school were tense. Every day I‚Äôd open the door to the same delivery driver, making me wonder if he ever got a day off. In all our contact I‚Äôd learned his name was Cody, and no, he never got a day off. The stacks of packages seemed smaller than before, and Mom hadn‚Äôt been nearly as snippy. She thanked me when I served her meals, helped her up from her nest, and seemed pleased with every new purchase. I hated the new fridge, beeping at me every time I opened the door, the sound of ice cubes falling inside jolting me away at night. The latter was something I could get used to, but it seemed the fridge had become a third person in the home, and it did not care about noise at all hours.   
  
When I offered to help mom set up some of the packages she‚Äôd gotten, like a bookshelf with drawers still taped up together in its box, she waved me off.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll get around to it,‚Äù She said, her eyes glued to her iPad, ‚ÄúOnce I‚Äôm all better.‚Äù   
  
The day came when I had to leave for school, and as I packed the last of my things into my car, I looked up at the house. Mom was now able to move around a lot more, albeit only in short bursts, and assured me she would be fine while I was away.   
  
‚ÄúI bet I could order a robot online that does all the work, then I wouldn‚Äôt need you at all!‚Äù She‚Äôd said, laughing. I didn‚Äôt laugh with her, because she wasn‚Äôt even looking at me. Eyes fixed to the screen, deep bags setting in under her eyes, a grin plastered on her face as she clicked the one-click-buy option on whatever caught her fancy next. As I pulled away from the house, I saw the familiar delivery truck with Cody behind the wheel pulling in behind me.   
  
Coming back to my dorm room was something of a relief. It‚Äôd become so cluttered at mom‚Äôs house that being surrounded by my things, thankfully pretty sparse, I felt able to breathe for the first time in a while. Away from the house, I threw myself into my studies and meeting back up with friends, and though it was always at the back of my mind, I was able to put away my concerns about mom for a while. After I‚Äôd finished my final test, I checked my phone to see a missed call from my mom. Groaning quietly, I opened my voice mail, fully expecting another request regarding her newfound hobby.   
  
I didn‚Äôt expect the earsplitting wail of agony coming from my phone speakers. Mom was saying something, but it was muffled behind grotesque sobs. All I could make out were the words ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp me.‚Äù Dread sank into my gut, I all but ran to my car while dialing 911.   
  
The drive to get there had me rocking back and forth in my seat at every stoplight, pushing the speed limit far beyond legal standards. As I pulled up to my childhood home to find police and an ambulance gathered, I stumbled out of my car.   
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked, all but falling into the first police officer who would talk to me. Over his shoulder, I could see Cody speaking to the police, still in his delivery uniform. We made eye contact, and I could see the look of horror in his eyes as he registered my face. He looked away just as quickly, lip trembling as he tugged his hat down over his eyes.  
  
‚ÄúI need you to step back,‚Äù The officer said, an expression of stoic discomfort on his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sorry, but we‚Äôve confirmed a fatal incident inside the residence.‚Äù   
  
My stomach dropped, my eyes drifting over slowly to the open, wide front door of Mom‚Äôs house. Maybe it was my imagination, but I could swear I could see blood on the walls of the entryway.   
  
‚ÄúThe scene is secure,‚Äù The officer continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to need to ask you to stay behind the caution tape until we‚Äôve completed our investigation.  
  
Fuck that. 

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I screamed, ducking around him and bolting for the front door, ignoring the calls behind me to stop. What had been a straight shot indoors had become a maze of boxes, with towers reaching up to the ceiling full of unopened, worthless trinkets, and packaging paper crinkling underfoot as I made my way inside. I had to squeeze through a few stacks before I emerged out the other side into the living room, where several officers and a crime scene photographer stood, looking at me in surprise. ‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶!‚Äù

The living room was the worst by far, with a mix of open and unopened packages, along with clumps of wadded tape discarded in the corner. Obnoxious neon green, red, and blue items are strewn all over. Gardening items, bottles of chemicals, cutlery all over the room, along with bundles of things I knew mom would never use. The floor was uneven from all the scattered boxes, and the stench of rotten food and fishy, partially opened tins near the armchair made my nose hairs curl. Packages of groceries that hadn‚Äôt been put away piled up on the edge of the kitchen, and from here I could still see the old fridge peering in like a concerned neighbor, while a familiar set of beeps told me the new one had been left open again. I don‚Äôt know why I absorbed the mundanity of it all, how perfectly normal it all was while I stared down at her.

Vanessa‚Äôs body was curled over the uneven mix of carpet and cardboard like a ragdoll, her head turned slightly to the side as blood, now dried, had dripped over her cheek. Her eyes, half closed, were stripped of all intelligence and wit. Stolen away by the colorful knives stabbed into her chest, neck, and stomach. She must have just come from work, still wearing a lawyer-appropriate pencil skirt and blazer, the dark colors only darker around the blood stains. Her hand draped over a box saying ‚ÄúEasy Home Organizer!‚Äù while her neck twisted unnaturally over what appeared to be a package of neck pillows.

I laughed, staggering as I stared down at her. Mom‚Äôs iPad and phone were on the floor, blood on the screens. Dents in Vanessa‚Äôs head looked like they could fit either one. The TV was broken, the cracked screen still showing an ad for an allergy pill, promising to last all day. I laughed again, looking at the screen, down at Vanessa. This was so funny. Come on, her neck snapping on a box of neck pillows? I laughed more. All that blood couldn‚Äôt be cleaned by all the carpet shampooers in the world. From the plugged-in, brand new apparatus pushed up against my sister‚Äôs stocking-clad leg, it was clear mom had been trying to do just that.

I don‚Äôt know how I got outside, standing still and laughing to myself quietly with firm hands clasping my shoulders. As I was sat down, my laughter turned into sobs, choking any other word that could have been said. Someone had been sitting with me for a moment, but when I was left alone, other officers still around discussing their investigation with muted voices, I found enough strength to stand. Maybe I had seen her in the backseat of the squad car at some point, but I staggered over, stopping only to press both my hands to the glass and stare at my mother. She stared back at me, trembling, crying. Blood still covered her. My sister‚Äôs blood.  
  
When I woke up, I was in the hospital. I was told by a nurse, the very same that had glared at me the day I went to visit my mother, that I‚Äôd fainted from shock. Numbly, I answered the questions of the investigators who came by. They told me Vanessa had come into the home, leaving the door open, and had gotten into a fight with my mom about the clear hoarding issue she had developed. As things escalated, Vanessa had tried to take away my Mother‚Äôs devices, leading to her being struck in the head by the iPad. As Vanessa was dazed, Mom had grabbed the knives she had just opened and stabbed each of them into my sister. Why all three? I wondered, why not just one multiple times? It didn‚Äôt matter. I could only imagine the argument, about how good the knives were, about how she‚Äôd show Vanessa how they were. Or maybe Mom was just that far gone.   
  
I listened to their report with glazed eyes until finally, they asked if there was anyone they could notify about the incident in the family.  
  
‚ÄúMy dad,‚Äù I replied slowly. He may be an asshole, but he still loved Vanessa. He deserved to know.   
  
Weeks later, after my mother had been put in jail awaiting trial for her prison sentence, my dad made the trip out to my college. I wasn‚Äôt going back home, and there was no way in hell I was ready to handle my sister‚Äôs affairs now that she was gone. All I could do was stay in my dorm room and sit, staring at the wall for hours on end. When we met up, we sat down at one of the many coffeehouses in the area in a fairly private, quiet corner. I‚Äôd been too numb to mumble anything other than whatever they had on special, and the frozen crap before me tasted like sugar shit itself. Dad tried to make small talk, but I cut through it immediately.  
  
‚ÄúWhat happened with you and mom?‚Äù I asked him, eyes fixed on the condensation spilling down the sides of the plastic cup and pooling beneath it. ‚ÄúIf you had stayed with her, if you‚Äôd been loyal, none of this would have happened.‚Äù  
  
I spoke those words to him, knowing full well they were directed at me. He stared at me for a moment, then let out a quiet sigh.  
  
‚ÄúYour mother‚Ä¶‚Äù He began, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd stayed glued to the TV for hours, calling in every toll-free number on screen and ordering everything she‚Äôd see in commercials. It wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ It was never as bad as what happened to you. Back then, everything was limited to whatever they could play on the air in between shows. Now, you can‚Äôt escape from them. It killed us financially--‚Äù He paused, swallowing around the word. I could see tears in his eyes. I felt them burning in my own. ‚ÄúI did cheat on her; there‚Äôs no changing that. No excuse. I couldn‚Äôt take it, the stress of the money, and she just kept spending it all. When we divorced, she changed for the better. I thought it was behind her. I thought it was. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

As we both devolved into tears, nothing much else was said. Vanessa was dead, and I realized, with dread in my heart, that I had given my mother the gun that killed her.",0,1754209096.0,creepcast,1,0.33,False
