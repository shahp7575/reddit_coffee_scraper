I’m a guy who is 29 staring down his 30th birthday next month. Im from Illinois, just looking to meet some new people and have real conversations. Life has gotten pretty work-focused lately and my social circle shrank more than I expected, so I figured I’d put myself out there.

A bit about me:

Blue-collar background / business owner

Into coffee, road trips, motorsports, live music, and random deep talks at 2am

Pretty laid-back, sarcastic, and more of a “quality over quantity” friend type

Always trying to befriend every cat I meet.

I’m open to chatting with anyone — male or female — whether it’s casual conversation, shared interests, or even long-term friendships.

Not here to be weird or flirt my way through Reddit, just want genuine human connection.",1,1767535802.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1q3quaf,https://i.redd.it/ejgwchmcbcbg1.jpeg,"Man, I really thought my new DeLonghi Rivelia was a downgrade...","I recently upgraded from my old Magnifica to the new Rivelia, and for the first few weeks, I was honestly pretty disappointed. The coffee tasted okay, but not great, and I was starting to regret spending the money.

Then I realized I hadn't done ANY maintenance yet. 🤦‍♂️

I spent about 15 minutes this weekend giving it a full clean: took out the brew group, cleaned the milk frother, emptied all the trays, and just gave it some general TLC.

What a difference! The coffee tastes amazing now, just like it should.

I was so impressed with how easy it was to maintain that I made a quick video guide in case anyone else is in the same boat. It covers all the important steps in under 2 minutes:

1q3qu7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1q3qu7o/do_introverted_parents_also_feel_isolated_when/,Do introverted parents also feel isolated when baby is born?,"So there's a lot of talk about how socially isolated are parents with newborns/babies, especially new mothers. It usually refers to suddenly being cut off from old friends and former life, motherhood being a very lonely experience, not having anyone to hold an adult conversation with, etc. So I'm just curious, is this social isolation in parenthood also a thing with parents more on the introverted side? 

The thing is, I don't really seek much human interaction, I'm perfectly fine just being with my partner or doing stuff alone. It's not that I was socially inept or anxious, it's just that I have a coffee with a friend maybe once in two weeks and that's about the right amount of social contact for me to not be overstimulated, yet maintain some human connection. I don't have kids yet, but I have been a part of mom group chats and experienced boring playground smalltalks with people I have nothing in common with except having a kid, and with all due respect, it makes me cringe *hard*. I'd much rather just spend time with the baby alone.

Panera offers a few months free pretty regularly and this particular offer is available to sign up until 9/17. Since there are so many people on this subreddit claiming to be broke, this offer can be helpful for people who aren't eating enough. Sure, it's not anywhere near a complete diet, but can be a boost to calories with the following Sip Club orders:

Fountain drinks. TONS of sugar = TONS of calories.

Coffee. Most Panera locations have things you can add to your coffee like creamers/milk and honey. The milk and creamers will add fat and protein to your diet. The locations I go to will usually just give you an empty cup when you order. You could by all means fill it up with milk.

1q3qr35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1q3qr35/the_psychology_behind_why_your_hustle_is_actually/,"The Psychology Behind Why Your ""Hustle"" is Actually DESTROYING You (Science-Based)","I spent two years grinding 80-hour weeks thinking I was ""on my purpose."" Turns out I was just running from myself at full speed. The breaking point? I couldn't remember the last time I laughed. Like actually laughed, not that performative shit you do on LinkedIn.



Here's what nobody tells you about hustle culture: it's just workaholism with a rebrand and better marketing. I've gone deep on this topic through research, podcasts, books, and honestly, therapy. What I found changed everything about how I approach productivity.



The science is pretty clear. Your brain literally can't sustain the cortisol levels that chronic overwork creates. Dr. Emily Nagoski talks about this in Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle. She's got a PhD from Indiana University and spent years researching stress physiology. The book breaks down why ""pushing through"" isn't resilience, it's just your body accumulating debt it'll eventually collect on. Best part? She explains the biological mechanism behind why you feel like shit even when you're ""succeeding."" The stress cycle doesn't care about your quarterly targets.



Real talk, your body is keeping score even when you ignore the signs. Constant fatigue isn't a badge of honor. Neither is needing three coffees before noon or feeling nothing when you hit a goal you've been chasing for months. These aren't personality quirks, they're distress signals.



Cal Newport's work on deep work versus performative busyness hits different when you realize how much of hustle culture is just theater. His podcast and books explore how the most productive people actually work less, not more. They're just insanely intentional about those hours. The whole ""rise and grind"" thing often translates to eight hours of context switching and checking email, not actual meaningful output.



Here's the uncomfortable truth. A lot of hustle addiction is avoidance dressed up as ambition. When you're constantly moving, you don't have to sit with uncomfortable feelings or questions about whether you actually want what you're chasing. The research on this from behavioral psychology is wild. Dr. Judson Brewer, who studies habit formation and addiction at Brown University, found that the dopamine hit from ""being productive"" follows the same neural pathways as other addictive behaviors.



I started using Ash recently for this exact issue. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket, but for the relationship with yourself. The app helped me recognize when I was using work to avoid processing emotions. Sounds basic but apparently I needed an AI to point out that scheduling back to back meetings so I never had a free moment was actually a coping mechanism, not efficiency.



BeFreed is another app worth checking out if you're trying to actually learn and grow without burning out. It's an AI learning platform that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. 



Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it generates learning plans based on what you actually want to work on. You tell it your goals or struggles, and it creates customized podcasts from quality sources. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks. Plus there's a virtual coach you can ask questions to mid-session. Way more structured than random YouTube binges when you're trying to figure your life out.



The distinction between sustainable drive and destructive hustle comes down to recovery. The Art of Rest by Claudia Hammond compiles research from 18,000 people about what actually restores mental energy. She's a broadcaster and psychology lecturer who found that the most ""restful"" activities aren't always what you'd expect. Sometimes it's solitude, sometimes it's mild physical activity, rarely is it collapsing in front of Netflix because you're too fried to do anything else.



Your nervous system needs completion cycles. You can't just accumulate stress without discharge. That's not how human physiology works, no matter what some tech bro's morning routine thread claims. The Huberman Lab podcast goes into this extensively, discussing how rest is actually when your brain consolidates learning and growth. Without it, you're just spinning your wheels at increasingly lower efficiency.



Check in with yourself honestly. Are you working toward something or running from something? Do you feel energized by your routine or do you feel like you're constantly trying to outrun exhaustion? Can you stop without feeling guilty or anxious? If rest feels impossible, that's not dedication, that's dysregulation.



The most successful people I know personally? They guard their rest as fiercely as their work time. They understand that sustainable output requires actual recovery, not just switching from work tasks to ""side hustle"" tasks. They've figured out that optimization includes optimizing for longevity, not just next quarter's numbers.



Your worth isn't your productivity. Obvious statement but genuinely wild how many of us need to relearn that repeatedly.",1,1767535532.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

1q3qpfr,https://i.redd.it/dsmi9y19acbg1.jpeg,18 hours in unexpectedly but feeling great!,"I love reading these while I’m fasting, so here’s mine!

 Yesterday, I made a bunch of French onion soup and a batch of chocolate chip cookies (prepped some stuff first thing so I didn’t have to spend all day cooking for the family). Saturday was a “free day” where I wasn’t focused on fasting, since I’m getting back into it and just wanted to listen to my body. Mid morning I had a bowl of soup for breakfast and half a cookie (random, I know lol). 

Around 2pm I had another bowl of soup, and a decent sized salad.  (I know it’s not many calories,  but I have plenty to lose, and was fine). Then I just thought hmm, what if I let that be it for the day? I was satisfied, so gave it a whirl. 

Around 8-10pm I was mentally hungry but physically fine. I went into the kitchen probably a dozen times but didn’t get anything other than a couple glasses of water. I kept looking at my fasting app, and I swear it was counting backwards lol. The struggle was so real. I was SO READY to eat but took my butt to sleep instead. I really didn’t want to have to restart, knowing sleep would easily add another 8+ hours until I had to think about food again. 

I woke up around 6am and felt incredible. I am currently ENJOYING a hot cup of black coffee, and decided to just stick with it today and see what happens. I am wanting to reap all the benefits from fasting, not just weight loss. It’s a great tool to create a deficit, but I want aaaaallll the good stuff that comes with fasting. 

I’m 18 hours in and feeling optimistic, so of course I think I can last til tomorrow. lol we shall see. Ultimate goal is rolling 72+, so let’s see how this goes 😎 anyone here do rolling 72s?",3,1767535409.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

I know the pairing on paper is off balance but, in reality, I'll likely be using ~250-300w with brief spikes from the AC mini fridge compressor and DC mini water pump. No power tools, coffee machines or hair driers here!

Could I still use my 125a MRBF terminal fuse and 4 AWG cable because of this too or would I need to replace the cable with something even smaller?

I feel like everything is okay since the inverter will only pull what's needed but are there other issue I haven't considered especially while I'm only on a single 100ah battery or am I okay?",1,1767535347.0,SolarDIY,2,1.0,False

Standard shit - glowing skin, before/afters, ""clinically proven formula"" blah blah. We're doing okay, about $40k/month, nothing crazy.

Then I made an ad that my client straight up rejected. She literally said ""this is disgusting, we're not running this.""

I convinced her to test it with $500 just to prove it wouldn't work.

That ad scaled to $250k/month and became our entire growth strategy.

https://preview.redd.it/5wzuol3q9cbg1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd144fa003583201a02f07ececdc7000e4592fdf

**The ad everyone hated**

The image was a close-up of clogged pores. Not even that bad, just... real. Like what you see in your mirror when you look too close. Uncomfortable to look at but you can't look away.

Copy was three lines:

* ""This is happening under your skin right now""
* ""Every day you wait, it gets worse""
* ""\[Product\] removes it in 48 hours""

No ingredients list, no doctor testimonials, no educational bullshit about skin pH levels. Just a problem you couldn't unsee and a fix.

First 72 hours: 4.7% CTR (our normal was 1.2%), 8.3% conversion rate (normal was 2.8%), $12 CPA (normal was $34).

The comments were insane. ""omg I need this NOW"" ""why did you show me this"" ""ordered before I finished reading""

People weren't thinking. They were reacting.

And that's when it clicked - we'd been doing this completely backwards.

**Why this works (the psychology part)**

Okay so there's this concept called loss aversion. Basically, humans are wired to avoid pain way more than we seek pleasure. Like 2-3x more motivated by fear than by desire.

But here's the key thing most marketers miss:

Benefits are future. Fear is now.

When you show someone glowing skin, they think ""that'd be nice eventually."" When you show someone their actual problem, they think ""oh fuck, is this happening to me RIGHT NOW?""

I tested this across 14 different brands after that first win. Fear-based ads convert 2-3x better than benefit ads. Every single time.

**The structure (what actually works)**

After I figured out the pattern, I rebuilt it for other products. Here's what matters:

**The image does 80% of the work**

Don't show the solution. Show the consequence.

What worked:

* Blackheads (not severe acne - has to be relatable)
* Yellow teeth with plaque buildup
* Dust particles in sunlight
* Matted pet fur
* Cluttered junk drawer

What flopped:

* Anything too extreme (people dismiss it as ""not me"")
* Anything too abstract (has to be immediately recognizable)
* Body shaming angles (just creates backlash)

The test: if someone sees it and thinks ""wait, is that me?"" you've got it.

***The headline is present tense***

""This is \[bad thing\] happening \[right now\]""

Not ""get rid of blackheads"" or ""achieve clearer skin."" That's future shit. People will think about it later.

""This is building up in your pores right now"" hits different. It's happening. Today. While you're reading this.

***Then make it worse***

Second line: ""Every day/night/hour you wait, it gets worse""

This is the part that creates urgency. It's not just bad now - it's compounding. Getting worse. Every day you don't act is another day of damage.

***The solution is specific and fast***

""\[Product\] removes it in 48 hours""

Not ""improves skin over time"" or ""clinically proven to reduce."" Fuck that. Give me a specific outcome in a specific timeframe.

24-72 hours seems to be the sweet spot. Short enough to feel urgent, long enough to feel believable.

**Real numbers from actual campaigns**

***Skincare (blackhead thing):***

* Spent $47k over 3 months
* Made $286k
* 6.1x ROAS
* $18 CPA

Weirdly, customers from this ad had HIGHER lifetime value than our ""nice"" ads. I think because they got immediate relief, so they trusted the product more.

***Dental whitening:***

* Spent $23k over 2 months
* Made $109k
* 4.7x ROAS
* $22 CPA

Key thing here: ""every coffee, every glass of wine makes it worse"" performed way better than generic ""every day it gets worse."" Be specific about the cause.

***Air purifier:***

* Spent $89k over 4 months
* Made $394k
* 4.4x ROAS
* $41 CPA (higher ticket item)

Even at $149 price point, fear of health consequences beat price resistance.

**What works and what doesn't**

Works great:

* Anything with a visible consequence (skin, teeth, home cleanliness)
* Health stuff where fear is rational (air quality, water quality)
* Things people are already worried about but ignoring

Doesn't work:

* Fashion (fear doesn't drive style choices)
* Food/supplements (too regulated anyway)
* Electronics (no visceral fear trigger)

Financial stuff (creates avoidance, not action)

**How to test this yourself**

Start simple:

1. Pick one product
2. Find the consequence people actually fear (not what you think they fear - dig into comments on competitor ads)
3. Get a close-up photo that's uncomfortable but real
4. Write: ""This is \[happening\] right now"" / ""Every \[time\] you wait, it gets worse"" / ""\[Product\] fixes it in \[timeframe\]""
5. Test with $500

Don't overthink it. If your first test gets strong reactions in the comments (even negative ones), you're on the right track. If people just scroll past, it's not visceral enough.

The comments tell you everything. Look for ""omg I can't unsee this"" or ""why did I watch this"" or ""I need this immediately.""

**Testing stuff now**

Currently trying:

* Video versions (motion might be too aggressive)
* Less intense visuals with same copy structure (can we get 80% of the results with 50% of the discomfort?)
* Sequential ads (fear → education → conversion instead of all-in-one)

Biggest question I'm sitting with: is there a version of this that works without making people feel shitty?

Because here's the thing - this converts insanely well. Best ROAS I've ever seen. But I also sometimes feel like a dick running these ads, even though they solve real problems.

Haven't figured that out yet.

**Real talk**

Most marketing advice is about building positive brand associations and inspiring people and all that nice stuff. And that's great for long-term brand building.

But if you need to acquire customers efficiently and scale fast? Fear-based ads outperform by 2-3x. Not sometimes. Every time.

The market rewards what works, not what makes us feel good about ourselves.

You can decide if that's a problem or just reality.  
\--- --- ---

Anyway, that's what I learned spending six figures on ads that make people uncomfortable. Happy to answer questions if anyone actually read this whole thing.

I’m super into gaming (cozy games + some indie stuff, currently obsessed with anything that has me building cute homes bases), old pop music that I will never grow out of, binge-watching weird YouTube documentaries, and collecting way too many plushies.

Would love some internet buddies who are also kinda nerdy, maybe a little awkward, definitely kind. Age around 18-27ish would be cool but honestly as long as you’re chill I don’t mind. Bonus points if you also had an emo phase that never fully ended lmao

started because my job cut my hours from 40 to 25. needed something flexible i could do from home. saw people here talking about social media services so i made a list of local businesses and started messaging them on instagram

sent like 150 messages over the first 2 months. most ignored me. some said they already have someone. one lady said her nephew does it for free. couple people asked my rates and then ghosted after i said $150/month

finally got a coffee shop owner to try me out. she wanted 8 posts per month for $100. thought that was easy until i realized i had to actually make the content. my phone camera sucks and i felt weird standing in her shop taking photos for an hour. customers kept staring

she wanted me to come film every week. i said i cant do that. she said then this isnt gonna work. quit after one month

tried offering just caption writing instead. found 2 people on reddit. one paid $50 for 10 captions. other one wanted captions plus stock photos. spent 3 hours looking for free images that didnt look terrible. made $75 that week and decided this was also too much work for too little money

started googling faster ways to make content. tried canva free first. upgraded to pro after a week but the templates still looked obviously templated. then tried some ai image stuff like midjourney but you cant really make it generate the same person twice

googled ""ai video generator"" and found a bunch of tools that let you create videos with ai generated people. tried a few. some had watermarks on the free versions. some were expensive like $30-40/month. ended up using one called APOB because it was $14/month and had daily free credits so i could test before paying. also tried descript for editing but that was more for podcasts

made a test video and sent it to a potential client before asking for payment. she said it looked more professional than her current content. signed her for $150/month

that was 3 months ago. now i have 4 clients. first one still pays $150. got her to refer someone who pays $200. found two more through cold outreach at $175 and $200

one client asked if i hired an actor for the videos. i said i outsourced the filming. technically true. another one wanted to meet in person to discuss strategy. i keep saying im booked with other clients. she seems fine with it but keeps asking

one client asked why the person in her video looks similar to her competitors video. i panicked and said theyre both stock models. she wasnt happy but renewed anyway

usually takes me 3-4 hours per client per month. includes writing scripts, generating videos, revisions, and all the back and forth emails. some months its more if they want changes

made $720 last month. this month one client paused because shes going on vacation so itll be more like $650. not sure if i should try to get more clients or raise prices for existing ones. also not sure how long i can keep doing this before someone asks too many questions

anyone else using ai tools for client work or am i overthinking the ethics thing. also how do you handle clients who want to meet in person",2,1767535001.0,thesidehustle,0,1.0,False
1q3qjo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EliSimpsonWrites/comments/1q3qjo2/of_cows_and_sea_myrtle/,Of Cows and Sea Myrtle,"This was not Everett's usual walk, but Asa had insisted on it. He said he wanted to try something new. It was astonishing. Asa was 200 years old and stubborn. He didn't often do new things, a consequence of being the living embodiment of a tree. Well, former embodiment. He'd given that up two years ago. His hands still had the rough, wood-like quality they'd had before, but he was aging. Gone was the thin face of a young man. It had rounded out. Everett loved it.

His arm was around Asa's shoulders as they meandered the mist-covered path. The air was chilly around them, and that particular smell of winter, the one that is crisp and woody and fire all mixed together, hung about. The grasses and bushes around them wore their fall colors, golds, browns, reds, and oranges.

""It's so pretty here,"" Asa murmured. He leaned his head on Everett's shoulder, the brown locks tickling Everett's chin.

""It is. I'm glad you insisted.""

Lips met stubble from a quick peck.

""I always insist.""

Everett chuckled as Asa pushed out from under his arm, wrapping his arms around it instead.

Farmhouses sat in the distance, half-hidden in the fog. From somewhere off to the side, a loud mooing came, and Asa startled.

""What was that?""

Amusement warmed Everett's voice as he answered. ""A cow. Four legs, where the milk for your coffee comes from. Gentle creatures.""

He barely noticed he was doing this. Asa was still new to the outside world and learning. It was strange to be teaching someone much older than him everything that existed. Asa had lived by a lake his whole life, rooted there quite literally. Everett's mind had trouble thinking of that as something good.

Three birds zipped across the path ahead of them, and they paused. Everett's eyes followed their movement until he could no longer see them.

""Connection,"" Asa had told him. Everett hadn't understood then. His world then was still tainted by blues and grays, a depression that would never go away. Asa had become his anchor, and the episodes were much further between now.

Asa wrinkled his nose as he scanned the land around them. ""Are they cute? I want to know if they are cute. Are they like the little seedlings that poke up in spring?""

Everett sighed in amusement. ""Some people think they're cute. If we find one, we might be able to pet it.""

Asa turned to Everett, green eyes wide and mouth turned up in delight. ""Yes! Please!""

The mooing came again, much closer now.

""I bet they're adorable,"" Asa declared, ""like sea myrtle in the fall when they get all fuzzy with blooms.""

A giggle followed the statement, and Everett joined in. Asa had this way of always accidentally finding the exact simile that worked. Perhaps that was just two centuries of wisdom showing up.

Mooing harmonized with their laughter as a cow sauntered over to them. It was mostly white. A stripe of black ran along its back. Asa's laugh cut off, and he studied the creature. He held out a hand. The cow sniffed and then licked.

""It's cuter than I thought."" The cow nuzzled Asa's hand. ""Root, come here and pet her.""

He had no choice. When Asa used that nickname, it was serious. Everett grinned as he wrapped one arm around Asa's waist and lifted the other to join in petting the cow.",1,1767534992.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

1q3qfz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1q3qfz2/how_to_avoid_getting_scammed/,How to avoid getting scammed,"In the supplement world, like everywhere else, you have to go by logic, not by “social vibes.”

Think about it: if substance X really works, and I mean *really* works, then there are going to be dum dums who swallow it like candy (to get even more effects) without researching whether it’s safe in high doses for the liver or kidneys, whether taking a lot at once could cause hypertension, whether it causes somnolence that affects their ability to drive, or whether it might even mess with their friggin' brains.

For this reason, substances that actually work tend to be regulated *because* they work. You get them in a controlled environment, where a doctor explains what foods and drinks not to take with them (e.g. cheese strongly interacts with MAOIs), the dose at which they become effective, and the dose at which they become problematic or toxic.

The immediate consequence of this is that most of the stuff that is unregulated and can be bought by the pound or kilogram without a second thought from your favorite online source is **peepee kaka**. Reading online claims will, of course, make you think otherwise, which brings me to my next point.

# Thoroughly research stuff before buying. It will save money and mental health.

* For instance, when herbs are studied for anxiolytic properties, scientists often use **ethanolic extracts** that significantly increase the level of active compounds. Now, what do most people do when they hear that lemon balm can be good? They make friggin’ TEA out of the plant leaves or take whole-plant-in-a-pill supplements. That’s like trying to mimic the effects of five Red Bulls with a glass of Coca-Cola. Then, thinking they used what the scientists used, they say they “felt something,” but never rave about it like *holee sh\*t*, because, as expected, the placebo relaxation they duped themselves into is just that: “*Uh, I think there was something there.*” You think? For comparison, do you merely *think* there was something there when you chugged two coffees?
* Pay very careful attention to the wording of online opinions. Do they say: *“Holy heck, I was so anxious before that I couldn’t drive my car, I couldn't even muster the courage to go to a barber/hair salon. But now I can go to a crowded mall and... enjoy it a bit, instead of hating it?”* **or,** do they say: *“These capsules are small enough to be easily swallowed, have good ingredients, and provide gentle support.”* Like… I’m sorry, but if you actually suffer from anxiety -- and not whatever normal folks imagine anxiety to be -- then the support has to be **anything but** ***gentle***. It should feel like a breakthrough, even if it’s not a complete cure.

Two substances did give me a sort of breakthrough, and when that happens, you don’t care that you’re not completely fixed. You don't care that the supps are not perfect. You’re just glad that an actual change in the tune has occurred. This happened to me with lithium orotate (10mg) combined with NAC (3 g per day in split doses, and it takes a while until something is noticeable). For the first time in I don’t know when, I could make mistakes without despairing about it, without wishing afterward that I was never born. I felt a slight taste of normality. I was more relaxed around people, especially from the lithium, and had this sense that no matter what happens, *it’s okay, bro;* a warm, safe blanket was over my soul.

Not surprisingly, one of the only things that truly impacted me, lithium, is also actually used in psychiatry. Why? Because it's not bullsh\*t.

Before these two, though, I stupidly bought L-theanine in bulk because it was “definitely effective” according to redditors who probably don’t understand what the word anxiety actually refers to. And guess what? 200 mg, 400 mg, and even up to **3000 mg** (three grams, taken at once) were utterly impotent for my despair episodes, which is where I needed anxiolytics to begin with. If anything, it seems to increase my sensitivity to triggers. I roll my eyes every time some special snowflake worries they went over 400 mg and now feel “a bit sedated.”

Same thing with the **magnesium mantra** people throw at everything. No doubt it helps; but if fixing a magnesium deficiency did more than provide “gentle support” or something “subtle but effective,” you wouldn’t hear about it in such subtle terms. You’d hear your buddy rave about how 400 mg of magnesium glycinate per day made him look forward to each day, whereas before that he felt mostly anxious dread.

# “But subtle effects add up!”

Okay, so how many subtle supplements are you willing to stack: 6? 12? 15?

To achieve what **1-3 prescription pills** can usually do in hours or days?

# Bottom line

Use your head when setting your expectations and assessing what to try and what to ignore.

And most importantly, always research potential negative effects, especially on **fertility, libido, liver, kidneys**. Herbs require special caution on that front.",2,1767534700.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

My name is Umang. I met Akansha in our first semester of MBA. Same university. Same campus. Different classrooms—but somehow, the same coffee breaks.

She was the kind of person who made group discussions feel lighter and deadlines feel less heavy. We started as classmates, then friends, and before I knew it, she became the person I wanted to sit next to in every lecture—even the boring ones.

Our relationship grew between presentations, internships, late-night submissions, and shared dreams of “one day.” We talked about careers, cities, and futures like they were guaranteed.

Then placements started.

Slowly, priorities changed. Stress replaced excitement. Calls became shorter. Texts became formal. I kept telling myself it was just pressure—that once this phase passed, we’d be fine.

But she started drifting. Not dramatically. Not loudly. Just quietly.

I was still planning my future with her. She was planning hers without me.

The day I finally asked what was wrong, she said, *“You’re an amazing person, Umang. I just don’t feel the same anymore.”*

No fight. No blame. Just one sentence that erased two years of memories.

Now when I walk past our university cafés, I don’t miss the place—I miss the version of us that existed there. The laughter before reality hit. The love before ambition took over.

MBA taught me many things—finance, strategy, leadership.  
But it never taught me how to let go of someone I still love.

Not everyone who walks with you in college will walk with you in life.

1q3qcdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/1q3qcdv/on_laptops_in_cafes/,On Laptops in Cafes,"I wanted to add to the discourse on a post I saw a few weeks ago lamenting laptops in cafés.

The original post implied that people who camp at tables with laptops are entitled, punk youths taking up valuable, revenue generating space.

No, people who camp out at tables are not inherently taking up “valuable” revenue-generating space, though the social contract says that one should do more than buy a single coffee or pastry over several hours.

Many replies, did express a sense of entitlement to a table at their favorite cafe for as long as they wanted. I saw many comments along the lines of, *“Well, if I can’t camp out with my laptop, I won’t patronize your cafe and neither will anyone else.”*

Which is fine. Folks are free to patronize whichever cafés they wish.

There were plenty of folks criticizing those who abuse their presence in a cafe, take hour long video calls or work while breaking the social contract of common courtesy. Folks shouldn’t spread themselves out taking up a 4 person table with their work laptop for 2 hours, this is just rude. Obviously one shouldn’t be on speaker phone calls or the dreaded person who has AirPods in their ears and is speaking way louder than they realize.

Which brings me to my point.

There exist many very popular, successful cafes that prohibit laptops and have no WiFi. They enforce this and I’ve witnessed them doing so. The most common retraction: “*Oh, I didn’t realize! No worries!*”

Faro Cafe in Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA famously has signs everywhere that say “*THIS IS A LAPTOP FREE CAFE*”. When someone brings a laptop, they politely point this out and ask them to put the laptop away as soon as convenient.

The cafe becomes completely full (standing room only) with students having conversations, journaling, or reading. This business absolutely does not suffer from their laptop ban.

Cafe Grumpy in NYC is another example. The list goes on: Postmark Cafe in Brooklyn and a few others I seem to remember.

A cafe that discourages laptops use has a different vibe, the folks it brings together are seeking out a break from technology it’s a true third space with socializing and conversation.",8,1767534422.0,providence,6,0.64,False

I’ve been dreaming about doing work that actually matters instead of just following endless meeting notes and spreadsheets like I do now.

I can picture myself leaving my coworkers who’ve become sort of family, the coffee shop where the barista knows my order, even my favorite lunch spot near the office.

I’ve been packing a few boxes just to see how it feels. I keep looking at my closet, thinking about leaving everything behind. And the weird thing is, I feel both thrilled and panicked at the same time. Like my heart is saying yes but my stomach is screaming no.

Part of me is thinking, this is the chance to grow, to actually lead projects I care about, to stop playing it safe. Another part is like, what if I fail, what if I hate it, what if I lose all the people I care about. I keep pacing around my apartment, texting friends for advice, but honestly, no one can decide this for me.

I can picture both scenarios. If I stay, I feel safe but maybe stuck in my junior project coordinator role forever. If I go, I might feel alive but lonely, facing long hours, high pressure, and all the uncertainty that comes with startups. I can’t stop going back and forth. It’s exhausting but also kind of exciting.

I was working with this cute, local cafe, and it was peak autumn – you know, cozy vibes, crunchy leaves, and *all* the pumpkin spice. We decided to launch a huge social media campaign, 'Pumpkin Spice Everything,' to really lean into the season.

The idea was simple: vibrant photos, catchy captions, and a unique hashtag to get everyone buzzing. We brainstormed for ages, landed on #PumpkinSpiceLife, and were feeling pretty chuffed. The launch day came, and I was all nervous excitement, hitting 'post' on our first big Instagram blast. I watched the likes tick up, feeling that warm glow of a successful campaign start.

Then, my phone started blowing up. Not with praise, but with frantic texts from the cafe owner. My heart sank. I checked the post again, and there it was, glaring at me in all its horrifying glory. Instead of #PumpkinSpiceLife, a rushed copy-paste job (and maybe too much coffee on my end) had turned it into... #PumpkinSpiceSlut. Yes, you read that right. I immediately felt my face drain of all color, and the tips of my ears burned with mortification.

Within minutes, the post was viral. Not in the wholesome, autumnal way we'd hoped, but in a 'OMG, look at this epic fail!' kind of way. Comments were pouring in – some roasting us, some genuinely confused, and a few (bless their hearts) trying to defend us, thinking it was some kind of edgy, intentional marketing. We pulled the post down in record time, but the screenshots were already everywhere.

We spent the next week doing damage control, apologizing profusely, and trying to pivot the narrative. Honestly, it was a nightmare. We eventually leaned into the humor of it a bit, with a follow-up post saying, 'We promise our lattes aren't *that* scandalous!' but man, that typo still haunts my dreams. The cafe actually got a bizarre boost in traffic from the sheer absurdity of it, but my soul still hasn't recovered.

So, Reddit, what's your most cringe-worthy marketing or social media blunder? Spill the tea, I need to know I'm not alone in my digital marketing nightmares!",1,1767533389.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1q3pttn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1q3pttn/the_psychology_of_why_youre_wasting_your_life_and/,The Psychology of Why You're Wasting Your Life (and How to Fix It in 37 Minutes),"I spent way too many years scrolling through life on autopilot. Working hard but going nowhere. Feeling busy but accomplishing nothing that actually mattered. And honestly? I thought that was just how life worked.



Then I stumbled across Ed Mylett's stuff (along with some game changing books and research), and something clicked. This isn't some rah rah motivational BS. It's about understanding how our brains actually work, why most people stay stuck, and what separates people who build incredible lives from those who just… exist.



Here's what I've learned from deep diving into peak performance research, neuroscience, and people who've actually figured this out:



Your brain is wired to keep you mediocre



Our brains are literally designed to conserve energy and avoid discomfort. Neuroplasticity research shows that your brain creates neural pathways based on repetition, which means if you've been living on autopilot for years, your brain has basically built a superhighway to mediocrity. The good news? You can rewire it. But it requires deliberately creating new patterns through consistent action, even when (especially when) it feels uncomfortable.



Stanford psychologist BJ Fogg's research on behavior change proves that tiny habits beat willpower every single time. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life tomorrow, stack one small behavior onto something you already do. Want to read more? Keep a book next to your coffee maker and read one page while it brews. Your brain doesn't resist small changes the same way it fights massive ones.



You're probably operating on someone else's timeline



Society programs us to follow this weird script: college by 22, career by 25, house by 30, etc. But high performers don't measure their lives in calendar years, they measure in what Ed Mylett calls ""personal years."" If you're moving faster, learning more, and taking more action than the average person, you're literally living more life in less time.



Research from performance psychology backs this up. Time perception is subjective. When you're growing and challenging yourself, you experience time differently. Meanwhile, people who do the same thing every day for 40 years aren't really living 40 years, they're living one year 40 times.



Your standards determine everything



Most people have ""wishes"" not standards. They wish they were fit, wish they made more money, wish they had better relationships. But wishing changes nothing. A standard is something you will NOT tolerate falling below no matter what. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits, the book that legitimately changed how I think about change. He's got a psychology background from Denison University and this book hit number one on NYT bestseller for a reason. It breaks down exactly how identity drives behavior. You don't rise to your goals, you fall to your systems. And your systems reflect your actual standards, not your stated ones.



Another absolute must read is The Power of Discipline by Daniel Walter. This book destroys the myth that discipline is about willpower or being ""tough."" It's about building frameworks that make the right choices automatic. Walter shows how elite performers in every field use structured routines to eliminate decision fatigue. Game changer for understanding why some days you crush it and other days you can't get off the couch.



You need to manufacture urgency



Most people operate like they have infinite time. Spoiler: you don't. Mortality salience research (yeah, studies on death awareness) shows that when people genuinely confront their limited time, they make drastically better decisions. They stop tolerating toxic relationships. They quit jobs that drain them. They start that business.



I use the Finch app to track daily habits and honestly it's weirdly effective. It's this cute self care app where you take care of a little bird by taking care of yourself. Sounds silly but the gamification actually works. behavioral psychology shows that immediate positive feedback (even digital) reinforces new habits way better than long term abstract goals.



Your environment is sabotaging you



You can't out discipline a bad environment. Period. If you're surrounded by people who mock ambition, complain constantly, and play small, you will too. It's not weakness, it's how mirror neurons work. Your brain literally mimics the people around you.



Jim Rohn's famous quote ""you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with"" isn't motivational fluff, it's neuroscience. Research from social psychology confirms that our peer groups influence everything from our income to our health habits to our life satisfaction.



This is where podcasts become insanely valuable. If you can't physically surround yourself with high performers yet, you can still flood your brain with their thinking. The Ed Mylett Show is obviously incredible for this. But also check out The Tim Ferriss Show where he deconstructs world class performers, and The Joe Rogan Experience episodes with high achievers (skip the conspiracy ones unless that's your thing).



BeFreed is an AI powered learning app built by Columbia University alumni that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts tailored to your goals. Type in what you want to learn, like improving discipline or building better habits, and it pulls from verified sources to create audio content at whatever depth you need, from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with examples.



The adaptive learning plan feature is particularly useful because it evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with the content. You can customize everything from the length to the voice (there's even a deep, movie Her style option if you're into that). Makes it way easier to fit actual learning into commutes or gym time instead of just zoning out to music.



Most people are solving the wrong problems



You're exhausted, unfulfilled, and stuck. So you think you need better time management. Or more motivation. But often the real problem is you're working toward goals that aren't actually yours. You're climbing a ladder leaning against the wrong building.



The Pathless Path by Paul Millerd absolutely wrecked me in the best way. Millerd left a prestigious consulting career to figure out what he actually wanted, and this book maps that journey. It challenges every assumption about what a ""successful life"" should look like. He's got an MBA and was doing ""all the right things"" but was completely miserable. Required reading if you suspect you're living someone else's definition of success.



For relationships and understanding yourself better, the Ash app is surprisingly deep. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket. Uses psychology based prompts to help you understand attachment patterns, communication styles, and why you keep repeating the same relationship mistakes. Way more scientific than typical self help apps.



Stop waiting for permission



Nobody is coming to save you. No perfect moment is arriving. You're not going to ""feel ready."" High performers act before they feel ready because they understand that clarity comes from action, not thought.



The research on this is clear: we overestimate the risks of action and underestimate the risks of inaction. That business you didn't start? That relationship you didn't pursue? That move you didn't make? Those aren't neutral choices. They're choosing one life over another.



Look, you've got maybe 30,000 days on this planet if you're lucky. Most people waste 20,000 of them waiting to start living. Figure out what actually matters to you, not what you've been told should matter. Build systems around those things. Raise your standards. Manufacture urgency. Fix your environment.



The life you actually want is on the other side of being willing to be uncomfortable for a while.

1q3pojb,https://www.reddit.com/r/conformitygatetheory/comments/1q3pojb/netflix_annoucement_analysis_my_own_theory_tell/,netflix annoucement analysis + my own theory (tell me if im onto something or on something chat),"Things to keep in mind while reading this:

1. The russian code “The week is long. The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west.”
2. The dialogue throughout this video: “Sometimes the universe shows u a sign. You can brush it off… call it a coincidence, but i know u got some questions. Lucky you. Your future’s on its way. Even when ur not looking, it finds u. So go on, all you gotta do.. is ask.”

Here’s the link btw if anyone needs it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrHKInOgrI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrHKInOgrI0)

The video starts off with a woman waiting at the bus stop. Behind her is a stranger things mural with all the characters. If you notice, she looks an awful lot like Joyce Byers. She has short dark brown hair, similar features and outfit. She’s also wearing rainbow colours inside her blue jacket (keep this in mind).

Then she sees a cat. A SILVER cat to be exact. The cat appears to be stalking/following the woman in the following shots.

The woman then gets on a GREEN BUS. The inside of the bus is BLUE and YELLOW. (byler colours). 

All this time she’s apparently been getting flashes. They look suspiciously like the hive mind, and also like the kind that Will used to dream of in s2(mind flayer?). Also, in one of those flashes theres a woman walking on the side walk wearing a pink gown and holding an umbrella. Behind her there are vines. But they disappear as the flash ends.

Then she gets off the bus and she runs inside the convenience store (it’s raining now). The cat follows her in there. The woman goes to refill her coffee mug. Then the cat leads her to a mysterious room where tarot reading takes place. Eventually she is brought to a red room with a psychic sitting there dressed in yellow (keep in mind).

What I find really interesting in the fact that the woman who looks like Joyce Byers feels like shes going crazy when she sees the flashes. Much like Joyce in s1 when will disappeared and everybody told her that she was crazy for believing he was still alive (even after seeing his body be pulled out from the lake). The dialogue in this particular scene talks about signs and coincidences. And if this is anything at all related to stranger things then we know not to believe that things are coincidences (s5 lucas while looking right into the camera). 

We also see a silver cat (which has often been associated with vecna in lots of theories), stalking/following the woman and eventually leading her to the tarot room. 

And if we take all of this and compare it to the russian code it makes a lot more sense. The week is long (joyce byers when crazy for almost a week), and i believe that refers to the part of the fandom that believe in confomitygate and fakefinalegate. 

The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west. And at the very end we get the woman (dressed in blue) meeting the psychic (dressed in yellow). Not only is the woman compared to joyce but also mike. She drinks coffee which mike has been associated with in s5. And MIKE also went crazy for a week believing that will was alive (if i remember correctly).

This is also where my own theory comes in.  If thats the case i think getting flashes that seem “coincidental” would also make sense now because compare this to when in the finale mike is the ONLY ONE who gets distracted by the sound coming from the speaker and also spins a theory about el running away and surviving because deep down he knows its true that el is alive and that something is wrong, he just doesnt know how. He knows it isnt real and the only reason he doesnt clock it is because he believes that thats the reality(but he still knows its weird ash). The silver cat stalking him would also make sense now bc the silver cat (vecna) is what started all of this (both in the video and the show), and the recurring appearance of the silver cat (vecna) is maybe what will lead him to question the existence/reality of his beliefs (the “finale”) if he ASKS(""all u gotta do u is ask"", it could also refer to us asking questions about the finale), ofc if conformitygate is real and mike is the one thats being vecna’d/flayed and its his pov that we got in the finale (assuming from how heavily focused on him the epilogue was).

and yea ofc jan 7 in the description. considering the rest of the announcement video im pretty much convinced conformitygate is real.

So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call.
About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize.
Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there.
She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out.
While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff.
But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine.

The first time you know someone, you tell them your favorite color.

between ""So, what do you do?"" and ""'What kind of music do you
like?

It's the first brick in a house that might never be built, a fact so small it shouldn't hurt when it disappears.
But it does,.
Because after a while, you realize you've told too many people your favorite color.

You've watched too many faces nod, too many voices say, ""Oh, that's nice, "" before they vanish into nothing. You've laughed at the same jokes, explained your coffee order, recited the little monologue about why you like the name you were given.

You've pressed repeat on your personality so many times that it's starting to sound rehearsed, like you're just another version of yourself instead of something real.

You sit across from someone new, and the script begins again.
They ask where you're from. You tell them. They ask what you do.
You say something that makes it sound a little more interesting than it actually is.

They ask for your favorite color, and you want to say, 
""Does it matter?""But you don't.
You say it anyway, just to see if it feels different this time.
Maybe it will. Maybe this one will stay. Maybe they'll remember.Maybe they'll buy you flowers in that color, or send you a picture of the sky when it turns just the right shade.

Maybe it won't be another name you forget, another half-written story, another number in your phone that will never light up again.
Oh God.

I'm tired of sharing my favorite color for the first time.
But who knows, I might still give it a chance, 
Maybe one day, It will be the last time I will say my favorite color to someone.

This one scene has stayed with me for decades and I've never been able to find the film.

**What I remember:**

**The Scene:**

* Takes place in a small, dingy apartment kitchen (yellowish/brownish walls, typical 1980s big-city tenement aesthetic with a boiler, very cramped space)
* Coffee is brewing/boiling on the stove in a pot
* Three people present: a younger man (possibly late teens/20s), an older man (possibly mother's boyfriend), and later or in the end of the scene a woman who looked like a prostitute (cheap/trashy appearance)
* The older man offers an apology to the younger man and asks for forgiveness
* The young man initially seems to accept the apology
* Then suddenly, the young man grabs the pot of boiling coffee from the stove and throws it in the older man's face
* Very violent and shocking scene

**Film Details:**

* American film, in English
* In COLOR (definitely not the 1953 film ""The Big Heat"")
* Made in or before the 1980s (I saw it around 1986-1988)
* NOT a horror film - more of a crime/drama
* Gritty, realistic tone
* Urban setting - looked like a run-down big city apartment
* The scene felt like it was about revenge - the young man was genuinely angry
* Possibly a TV movie or low-budget/exploitation film

**NOT these films:**

* The Big Heat (1953) - that's black and white

This scene has haunted me for over 35 years. The violence and the way the young man pretended to accept the apology before attacking made it unforgettable. Can anyone help me identify this film?",4,1767532155.0,whatsthatmoviecalled,1,0.83,False

Time to get started on Daisaku Ikeda’s Gosho lecture in the January Living Buddhism--tomorrow. Today I want to reflect on one more article in the January 1, 2026 World Tribune. [Strive Energetically for Kosen-rufu, Brimming With Vibrant Life Force!](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/strive-energetically-for-kosen-rufu-brimming-with-vibrant-life-force/) is an editorial President Harada contributed to add some depth to New Year’s determinations. 

>The Buddhism of the Sun shines—casting warm rays of hope upon friends facing adversity.

Yes, the Soka Gakkai is by/for/of people courageously seeking to summon hope to face all sorts of adversity. Lolita must have pulled in last night and I see her and Lori reunited and running on the track. For them, I am sure, “adversity” is planning for the next phase of the Longhouse School. Guy’s doctor has him taking small walks on his prosthetic foot, a little bit more each day; for him, “adversity” is overcoming this health challenge. Dee’s “adversity” is creating a new type of hope-filled spirit in the world to replace totalitarianism; she goes back-and-forth with the military action in Venezuela and, for now, is chanting that the aftermath doesn’t repeat Iraq.

>The Buddhism of the Sun pulses with life—in the depths of our hearts, as we stride forward for the sake of kosen-rufu. 

>No matter the circumstances, Soka Gakkai members awaken within themselves the vibrant life state of Bodhisattvas of the Earth, filled with boundless joy, and take dynamic action on the stage of their mission. This sublime spirit embodies the essence of Nichiren Daishonin’s words “When Bodhisattva Superior Practices emerged from the earth, did he not emerge dancing?” (WND-1, p. 1119).

That’s the spirit I want. “Boundless joy” and “dynamic action” on the stage of my own mission. Right here, “dancing” on the stage of my beloved community, nowhere else. 

Next, President Harada describes Ikeda Sensei’s “life of unwavering dedication to his vow.” It is our “guiding model.”

>On Jan. 6, 1951, at the dawn of a new year and in the midst of his most trying business struggles, second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda entrusted all matters of succession—both public and private—to his beloved disciple. Sensei accepted without hesitation, declaring: “I have always been prepared to give my entire life to you without the slightest regret.” The driving force for victory in all things is born from the disciple’s vow, to rise up for the sake of the mentor and advance alongside them. Let us engrave that spirit deep within our lives.

Sensei started practicing at the age of 19 in 1947. So at this time he was 23 and in his fourth year of practice. His mission was his, mine is mine, I am still young, and I will follow my vow.

>Sixty-five years ago, on New Year’s Day, 1961, Sensei declared: “I am determined to create a hundred years’ worth of history in one year.” Then, on Jan. 28, he set out on his first guidance tour to countries and territories in Asia, his heart ablaze with his mentor’s fervent wish—to send the light of the sun to the people of Asia—marking a bold and historic first step. 

My vow: “Let our five children grow into worthy successors! Let every Longhouse child thrive despite the cards they had been dealt, let all the members of RV Park Group experience boundless benefits!”

>With unwavering resolve to fulfill Nichiren Daishonin’s mandate of the westward transmission of Buddhism, he journeyed across Asia with the determination to infuse the land with daimoku. He wholeheartedly encouraged the small number of members striving there at that time, and during the visit he proposed initiatives that would later take shape as the Institute of Oriental Philosophy and the Min-On Concert Association. Sensei consistently envisioned a future in which the Soka Gakkai would flourish as a global religious movement grounded in humanism.

>At the January 1991 Headquarters Leaders Meeting, Sensei spoke of the life philosophy of the renowned comic actor Charlie Chaplin (1889–1977), emphasizing that the more challenges we encounter in the struggle for kosen-rufu, and the more bravely we confront them, the more “the greatest of all joys” (*The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings*, p. 212) of the Mystic Law will surge through every fiber of our being. With this mighty lion’s roar engraved in my heart, I am once again determined, this year, to give my all—for the attainment of Buddhahood by every member, for the establishment of the correct teaching for the peace of the land, and for the realization of lasting world peace.

Thank you, Pres. Harada, the Fam here will share your vow.

>We now stand at the midpoint on the path to completing the second series of Seven Bells. Let us each earnestly seek our mentor’s guidance, filling our lives with vibrant energy, and press forward boldly along the noble path of human revolution!

# What Makes Minimax 2.1 So Powerful

Minimax 2.1 is an open-source AI agent that builds and automates anything you describe.

You just tell it what you want — an app, dashboard, landing page, or even a game — and it builds it in real time.

No code. No hiring. No waiting weeks for developers.

It’s like having a full team of designers, engineers, and automation experts rolled into one system that never sleeps.

And unlike closed tools, Minimax 2.1 gives you full freedom.

You can host it locally for free or run it in the cloud through [Alarm.com](http://Alarm.com) with zero technical setup.



# The Moment I Realized It Was Different

I asked Minimax 2.1 to build a **3D SEO dashboard** with floating cards and live data.

Ten minutes later, it was done.

Charts, filters, hover animations — everything.

Then I told it to create a **browser-based racing game** for my community.

It coded it, designed it, and hosted it instantly.

I just pressed “Run.”

That’s when I realized Minimax 2.1 wasn’t another AI toy — it was an automation powerhouse.



# Minimax 2.1 Outworked My Whole Team

At my agency, a typical dashboard or website might take a week.

With Minimax 2.1, it takes minutes.

Here’s what I tested:

* SEO dashboard → 8 minutes
* Browser game → 12 minutes
* Drum machine → 15 minutes
* Landing page → 7 minutes

All from text prompts.

And the wildest part? It doesn’t stop after one project.

You can run multiple builds at the same time.

While it created the dashboard, I launched another task — an automation to post daily AI updates to Slack and Notion.

By the time I finished my coffee, both were live.

That’s the speed of Minimax 2.1.



# How Minimax 2.1 Works

Think of Minimax 2.1 as your AI builder and operator.

You give it a description, it writes the code, designs the interface, connects tools, and hosts the final project.

It supports over ten programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, HTML, and React — even if you don’t know any of them.

You can:

* Build websites, dashboards, or games
* Connect APIs like Google Maps or Slack
* Schedule recurring automations
* Deploy on your own subdomain

All inside a single workspace.

No plugins. No subscriptions.

Just results.



# Why Open Source Wins

Most AI platforms lock you in.

You rely on their servers, pay their prices, and follow their limits.

Minimax 2.1 breaks that cycle.

It’s fully open source — which means you can host it yourself, modify it, and never lose access.

It runs twice as fast as many commercial AIs, and you control every file, model, and output.

That’s what freedom feels like in automation.



# The 30-Day Minimax 2.1 Challenge

If you want to master it, here’s what I recommend:

For 30 days, build one project every day.

Day 1: Build a personal website.

Day 2: Build a custom SEO dashboard.

Day 3: Automate your content calendar.

Day 4: Create a browser-based calculator.

Day 5: Build a 3D leaderboard for your community.

Every day, increase the difficulty a bit.

By day 30, you’ll have built a full automation ecosystem — and learned more about AI implementation than 99% of people who just “research” it.

That’s how you actually master Minimax 2.1.



# From Idea to Execution in Minutes

The reason most entrepreneurs fail isn’t lack of ideas — it’s execution speed.

They spend months planning and researching but never build.

Minimax 2.1 eliminates that bottleneck.

You can test, validate, and deploy an idea in under an hour.

Imagine wanting to test a business tool.

You just prompt Minimax 2.1 to create it.

It delivers a live prototype you can send to users that same day.

That’s why the creators learning this now will dominate later.



# Connect Minimax 2.1 With Real Tools

Inside Minimax 2.1, there’s something called MCP — Multi-Control Plugins.

They let you connect Minimax to your favorite platforms like Slack, Google Sheets, Notion, Figma, and GitHub.

You can schedule recurring tasks, daily reports, or automation updates.

For example:

“Every day at 8:00 a.m., deliver a breakdown of all the latest AI updates to Slack.”

Minimax 2.1 runs it automatically.

You wake up to a ready-to-read report, built and delivered by your own AI assistant.

That’s automation at scale.



# Integrate Your Domain and Brand

Minimax 2.1 even lets you connect custom domains.

You can deploy your projects instantly and brand them however you want.

For example: “yourname-dashboard.com” or “agency-automation.ai.”

It’s like running your own mini SaaS factory.

Everything is live, shareable, and updatable on demand.

No third-party hosting needed.



# If You Want Templates and Workflows

If you want the templates and AI workflows, check out **Julian Goldie’s FREE AI Success Lab Community** here: [https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/](https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/)

Inside, you’ll see exactly how creators are using **Minimax 2.1** to automate content, education, dashboards, and client tools.

You’ll also find full frameworks and ready-made prompt templates that save hours.

The best part — it’s completely free to join.



# The Real Advantage: Speed

Every minute you spend wondering if AI will replace your job, someone else is using it to replace tasks.

Minimax 2.1 doesn’t make you irrelevant — it makes you unstoppable.

If you can think clearly and describe what you want, Minimax 2.1 can build it.

That’s how you multiply productivity without multiplying payroll.



# Minimax 2.1 vs. The Old Way

Before:  
You’d hire a developer, pay thousands, wait weeks, and manage endless revisions.

Now:  
You type what you want and get it in minutes.

Before:  
You’d buy dozens of SaaS tools and hope they integrate.

Now:  
You just connect everything inside Minimax 2.1 through MCPs.

Before:  
You’d lose months testing ideas manually.

Now:  
You launch and validate instantly.

This is the new way of building — fast, flexible, frictionless.



# For Agencies and Creators

If you run an agency, Minimax 2.1 turns your service into a product.

You can create:

* Branded dashboards for clients
* Automated SEO or reporting systems
* Custom AI tools you can resell
* Education portals with built-in analytics

Freelancers can use it to offer “AI automation packages.”

Creators can use it to gamify their audiences.

Educators can build AI classrooms.

The applications are endless.



# Join the Builders, Not the Watchers

Every day, new entrepreneurs are using Minimax 2.1 to replace repetitive tasks and accelerate results.

They’re not just saving time — they’re building leverage.

Because the real advantage in 2026 isn’t who knows AI exists.

It’s who’s building with it every day.



# My Favorite Part: Learning by Doing

The fastest way to learn Minimax 2.1 is to build.

You can’t “study” your way into mastery.

You learn through execution.

Every project teaches you how to prompt better, structure smarter, and automate deeper.

And once you see a working result on screen, you’ll never go back.



# The Future Is Already Here

1q3pfyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1q3pfyy/unfaithful_raf_wives/,Unfaithful RAF wives?,"During the 80’s there was a gang of us “good time” wives at RAF Brize Norton, anyone similar. Here’s my confession story

January 1987 ( I think) husband was away on exercise Hardfall in Norway I’d only been married a few months and living in a second floor married quarter flat Stanmore Cresent I think. He’d been away about two weeks it was really cold snow everywhere and I was really fed up so one Saturday morning I booked a hair appointment at the hairdressers in the same block where I lived to cheer myself up Once my hair was done I popped over the road to the local NAFFI supermarket to get some shopping and wine lol I did noticed this black guy in there but didn’t give him a second thought. He was at the till the same time as me and as I left he could see I was struggling with all the shopping and gentlemanly offered to help with a deep “can I help you ma’am”

At least 6ft 6in his massive arms just seemed to swallow my shopping up, of course I came over all unnecessary and said some ridiculous idiotic things as I tottered on my high heels on the short walk to my flat flicking my hair and sticking my bottom out, I established he was an American Airforce policeman based a little Rissington a few miles from Brize Norton and his wife had returned to California as she couldn’t stand the English weather, “Awwwe that’s a shame” I said, you must really miss her” really thinking other things Once at my flat he stopped at my door so I asked if he’d mind placing the shopping on the kitchen table, plan being offer him a coffee and get to know him a little. Somehow during the exchange of shopping of the last bag his forearm and my right breast came into contact and got a bit stuck our eyes met and for a brief second we froze,,,,, then kissed then passion just took over. Before I knew where I was I was bent over the kitchen table my white Aron sweater dress was up around my waist, my pink french knickers (fashionable in the eighties lol) and my opaque tights were down by knees and he entered me OMG!!! I though he was going to split me in two!!

His thrusts pleasured my senses in waves and I was unable to speak, mouth open but nothing came out! I just banged the kitchen table with my hand, he came quite quickly to be honest but his instinctive final push as he splattered warm semen on my cervix was deliciously painful. He collapsed on top of me and we just froze there. I was pinned to the table and couldn’t move, “oh man” he said “I so needed that.” He withdrew slowly even that was enjoyable but the noises where so embarrassing!!! There was a puddle of spunk on the floor!!! I turned and gave him gentle girlie kisses and tried to establish a time when we could meet again, he was guilt ridden and said he really didn’t know. Not me!!

I wanted more and soon! That very afternoon in fact lol tarted myself up and went round to his with some poor excuse or another.

There then followed a full blown affair at his flat and mine, as I indulged his lingerie fetish with my credit card from the house of Dorian ( the local ladies wear shop) several days I went to work quiet sore, I’d do anything to please him xxx",0,1767531818.0,confessions,1,0.33,False

I am half Turkish and Iranian and Bulgarian  for context and my boyfriends Greek so pretty common ritual in our region. 

I have predicted(apparently) many things like a specific illnesses happening, a past loss of a baby I had no idea about, a friend from many years ago contacting them, or getting a job offer when they haven’t expected one. 

But I really honestly don’t know how I do it. 

They believe in it, I keep telling them it’s for fun and not to base their lives around it obviously but I do not know how I do it.  I insist on not seeing any deaths or really bad things and if I do I usually don’t mention it. I read a lot about their mental state and emotions but also can see some things happening. 

Do you have any suggestions on what I should to tap further into this ‘intuition’ or help me understand how is this happening? 

I have always had a strong intuition and am very spiritual but never believed I have an actual gift for it.

I talked to her a few days over phone, sharing tiktoks and it was about 2-3 days ago that she was hinting so much that she liked me in that way, and being flirty that I straight up asked her if she swung that way. She did. And she knows I do too, also we both figured we like each other. The second this conversation happened she changed a bit, immediately she sent me one of those “if you need a shoulder to cry on, face to sit on…” kinda vids which I found funny. She started being a bit demanding, if i left her on delivered she’d ask why when honestly I could be doing anything, maybe I wasn’t even on my phone. She always asked wyd and I’d say nth and she felt a bit bad ig because she wanted to talk more but I just didn’t know what to talk about. She called me baby names all the time. She was a bit annoyed that when she sent me a pic of herself I reacted to it with a heart, she wanted more than that and when I wasn’t replying she said “i understand you don’t wanna talk to me, i’m not bothering you anymore”. She even sent me this vid the next day after “confessing” that was like “this should be us right now” and it had a moaning audio. This is also a secretive relationship all together, we live in a homophobic country, my friends don’t like her, her friends don’t know that she’s talking to me and I’m hiding this from my parents completely and I feel very guilty just looking at them.

I ended up telling her that I want us to just stay friends, she said “you don’t believe in me?” “I text too much” “You should have told me that you didn’t like me” “I’m sorry” “We didn’t have to have that conversation, you can’t do this to me, one day you like me and the other day you don’t, anyway it’s okay I respect you” I was telling her “listen I’m not ready for this, I like when we talk and when we went out for coffee but I personally can’t handle this, maybe we should have talked like this before because I also can’t decide if I like someone in one day, but i like you as a person and I wanna be friends, you don’t have to apologise to me, I needed to tell you to not have this go for 1-2 weeks maybe even a month to then make this conversation worse. I just changed my mind and I saw I can’t do this” and to this she said “because of me? I’m sad now yk”

I feel really guilty, I liked her for months and I wonder id I should have or if I should tell her that I still like her and I just want to take things slower, maybe ho on another coffee date again to talk and that honestly it’s just too stressful for me to keep such secret from everyone. Maybe even be true to her, to tell her I find her being so demanding, or that particular tiktok a bit much too soon.

1q3pbtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternativeIdol/comments/1q3pbtz/zenbu_kimi_no_sei_da_from_the_very_beginning_weve/,"Zenbu Kimi no Sei da — “From the very beginning, we've been outsiders on the scene” (Natalie Interview Translation)","“With Yami Kawaii, we will conquer the world” — this is the slogan proclaimed by Zenbu Kimi no Sei da. At present, the group is in the middle of their tour titled *“?? countries and cities, breaking beyond even the land of the rising sun \~Growth-Change-Invasion-Devouring — Loverosion\~,”* which includes overseas performances.

Neither the locations nor the total number of shows on this tour were determined in advance. As part of it, “Zenkimi” aim to perform not only in all 47 prefectures of Japan, but also across various countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Ten years have already passed since the group was formed, and even after achieving their goal of performing on a massive stage, the members continue to tour throughout Japan while also beginning to actively perform abroad. But what are they feeling as they do so? In this interview with five members of the group, we explore what Zenbu Kimi no Sei da are living for right now.

# “Things are going so well that it almost feels like we could move overseas and continue our activities there without any issues.”

*— The tour “?? countries and cities, breaking beyond even the land of the rising sun \~Growth-Change-Invasion-Devouring — Loverosion\~” started in June this year, but I was surprised to learn that neither its end date nor the full list of countries you plan to visit is known. About half a year has already passed since it began — how does this tour feel to you so far?*

**Muku**: To me, it's a tour that's not just open-ended in terms of schedule — the shows themselves feel incredibly free wherever we go. We, Zenkimi, always aim to put on “3D concerts”…

*— By “3D,” do you mean “three-dimensional”?*

**Muku**: Yes. Is that not a common way to say it?

**Kisaragi Megumi**: We use “3D” to describe the Zenkimi performance style where we literally jump off the stage and go straight into the audience (laughs).

**Muku**: In other words, a “3D concert” is one where you can do absolutely anything during the performance! That's how we see it, and it allows us to perform with enormous freedom. All of us are constantly rushing forward, and I'm really happy that we’re able to have a tour like this, where we can fully enjoy ourselves together with everyone.

https://preview.redd.it/puwmkpauxbbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4641080b6afbe1aa10fee012c30fd8f95daa6db4

**Megumi**: On this tour, of course we travel all over Japan, but we also perform overseas quite often. And we hear so many people say, “This is my first time seeing you.” For me personally, this is a tour that motivates me immensely — it makes me think, “I need to try even harder.”

*— You had performed overseas before, but this is the first time your Japanese and international shows have been combined into a single tour spanning so many countries. How has the response from international audiences been?*

**Mei Yui Mei**: The response has been absolutely amazing.

**Nene Komochi**: There are so many people who tell us with tears in their eyes, “We have been waiting for you.”

**Megumi**: We constantly meet people who have been following Zenkimi since around 2016 — longtime veteran “patients” (Zenbu Kimi no Sei da fans). Some of them came to Japan for our early shows, but because of the pandemic they haven’t been able to do so since, and have been waiting all this time. Others have been streaming our music and waiting. And judging by the audience responses, things are going so well that it almost feels like we could move overseas and continue our activities there without any issues (laughs).

https://preview.redd.it/ibtcu5uvxbbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c6ca2004078b6ad38e856642235fd23965bffa3

*— You have mentioned before that Zenkimi’s songs are listened to a lot overseas. Why do you think that is?*

**Komochi**: When you ask, “What's your favorite song?”, everyone gives a completely different answer. So it doesn't feel like people are drawn to just one specific genre.

**Megumi**: I think this really shows one of Zenkimi’s strengths — we have always challenged ourselves with a wide variety of genres, without worrying about how easy they would be to perform live. In fact, there are even people who request rare songs we hardly ever perform at concerts (laughs). I think this is the result of us constantly trying different things and never confining ourselves to strict genre boundaries.

**Hino Hikari**: I was really happy to see the explosive reaction from the audience to the song “coyubi,” which we released last year.

**Megumi**: Yes, the response to “coyubi” overseas is completely different from Japan. I thought it would catch on here first since it's still a relatively new song, but it's actually more popular abroad than in Japan, which surprised me. Even now, we don't really understand why that happened — it's still a mystery to us (laughs).

*— Mei-san, Yukueshirezutsurezure, which you were previously part of, toured overseas earlier than Zenkimi, and it was clear that the group also had a lot of overseas listeners. Do you feel any difference compared to that time?*

**Mei**: Back then and now, I feel the same joy from people being genuinely happy when we visit them, so I don't sense a major difference. However, there is a very clear connection to that period. On this tour, overseas fans quite often tell me things like, “I've been listening to you since the Tsurezure days,” or “I discovered codomomental through Tsurezure.” That really moves me — it feels like my past experience is firmly connected to the present.

https://preview.redd.it/19zl744xxbbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=763a7e802ad5f74b671cd8c2d46ca37d56dba274

# “Cultural exchange through fan chants”

*— Among all the countries and regions you have visited, which place left the strongest impression on you?*

**Megumi**: Most of the time overseas, we are invited to perform at various showcase events, but in Thailand we were able to hold our very first overseas solo concert, and that was an especially memorable experience.

**Muku**: The audience there included not only people from Thailand, but also from Malaysia, China, Europe, and America. Even people from Japan came — it was a truly global crowd (laughs).

**Megumi**: We went there with the excitement of, “At events we can't perform that many songs, but at a solo concert we can do a whole bunch of different ones!” But at the same time, we didn't know how the audience would respond not only to high-energy songs, but also to more ballad-like tracks and those meant for careful, thoughtful listening. But because everyone enjoyed the performance freely and in their own way, even during calmer songs some people would start cheering joyfully the moment the intro began to play. In Japan, I feel that people tend to adapt to the surrounding atmosphere and react collectively, but overseas fans give their reactions whenever they feel like it, and I found that really nice.

**Komochi**: And the way everyone sang along to “MudaiGasshou” was just incredible.

**Megumi**: It was so loud that our vocals, even amplified through microphones, were almost drowned out by it.

**Hikari**: Muku and I haven’t been to that many places yet, but the audience reactions differ from country to country, and it's great to make discoveries like, “Oh, so this is how people get fired up here!” The ways of warming up the crowd are different everywhere, so sometimes we have to experiment on the spot. But all of those moments, when we are in the same venue doing everything we can together to really enjoy ourselves, leave a very deep impression on me, and I enjoy every single show.

https://preview.redd.it/fjer9g01ybbg1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ce89338fcb05f75fbd8e7567df211450cbdad90

**Megumi**: At the concert in Malaysia, there was a local fan who went up to a Japanese fan and said, “I don't know what I'm supposed to do at the show — please teach me.” And the Japanese fan, through that kind of cultural exchange, started teaching them the fan chants. When I heard about that, I was deeply moved and thought, “What a wonderful atmosphere!”

**Muku**: Another thing that surprised me was how many people spoke to us in Japanese during local cheki sessions.

**Komochi**: Yes, it really is surprising. People learn Japanese through anime and games.

**Mei**: I knew that anime songs are popular overseas, but the fact that Zenkimi songs, which aren't even tied to anime, are listened to so widely is truly amazing. My dream is for us to make a song for an anime, so I'd love for all of us to someday perform our own anime song together at an overseas show.

**Muku**: This is not related to concerts, but no matter which country we go to, there's spicy food everywhere — the differences in food culture really surprised me. Komo-chan and I aren't big fans of spicy food, so it was often tough for us.

**Komochi**: I think I've already overcome my dislike of spicy food. I decided that when I'm overseas, I'll always try something new and never refuse food without tasting it first. I've been trying all kinds of dishes I'd never eaten before, along with spices I didn't know, and now I've gotten fairly used to spicy food. The only thing I still can't get used to is cilantro, so I leave that to my ""older sisters"" (laughs).

**Megumi**: Komochi ends up with an unbelievable amount of luggage whenever we go overseas. We have merchandise to sell, so we travel with lots of bags, sell the goods, and come back light — but somehow Komochi is the only one whose luggage increases (laughs). Recently, she even bought a bunch of yarn for some reason…

*— Yarn? For crocheting?*

**Komochi**: Yes, for crocheting. I love crocheting, and I had one of my handmade bags with me on the trip. A shop owner noticed it and started talking to me about it. In Japan, they would probably have tried to sell me something, but this overseas seller spoke with me very sincerely. That really touched me, so I ended up buying several skeins of yarn.

https://preview.redd.it/my8kjrl2ybbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d594182fec6a3fb0868e895cb202e1516d71ff5

**Megumi**: I was surprised — going all the way overseas and making such bulky purchases?

**Mei**: There were many moments when we really felt the cultural differences. For example, we heard that in some countries you shouldn't raise your little finger.

**Megumi**: Apparently, in some places that's considered an insulting gesture. And in some countries you aren't supposed to wear red clothes. I was like, “Then what am I supposed to do about my costume?!” (laughs)

**Komochi**: In the end, it turned out that if it's a stage outfit, it's not really a problem, so we were able to perform as usual.

# “If even one of the past members hadn't been there…”

*— This July marked the 10th anniversary since Zenbu Kimi no Sei da’s debut. Megumi-san, as someone who has continued these activities for the full ten years, how do you personally perceive this milestone?*

**Megumi**: I don't really feel that ten whole years have already passed. That said, there are of course many things we are capable of now only because of the path the group has taken over those ten years. Over that time, there have been many different members in the group, and I believe that if even one of them hadn't been there, then the fans who are waiting for us now in so many different places wouldn't exist either. And in the same way, if we had disbanded after Budokan, we would never have had the chance to meet so many people overseas.

*— Over the past ten years, the music industry has changed dramatically. Streaming has become dominant, trends on the idol scene have shifted significantly, and during the pandemic even the very essence of live performances had to be reconsidered. Yet despite all of this, Zenkimi has the strength to confidently continue its path.*

**Megumi**: From the very beginning, we've been outsiders on the scene and knew we didn't belong to any particular circle. And lately, I've been thinking that might actually have been for the best. We didn't have any so-called “rival” groups, but that didn't stop us from growing. We were constantly stimulated by our codomomental labelmates, and we always tried to give our all sincerely to the people who came to our shows, and that's how we grew. You know, only now, after ten years, have people finally started praising my singing (laughs). I wasn't very good at it in the beginning, but little by little, step by step, I suppose I kept improving.

https://preview.redd.it/pu75l1e4ybbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74b869079b847264255b3a6228df244fec0ab433

**Komochi**: You might have grown even compared to the Budokan performance.

**Megumi**: When I sing karaoke, I'm completely off-key — that's how little talent I have. But when it comes to Zenkimi’s songs, I can sing them properly—I've finally started to gain confidence in that. And also, recently I've started to be able to feel grateful for everything that's happened up until now.

*— You're not the type to complain, so it seemed like you had always been capable of that, but it turns out this happened only recently?*

**Megumi**: Yes. And I think the reason is that we finally managed to hold the Budokan concert. There were many tough moments on the way there, I was constantly maximally focused, and I always carried something like an obsession or a burden of responsibility that I had imposed on myself. And when we achieved our goal—finished the Budokan performance—even though this phrasing might cause misunderstanding, I felt that I was finally able to let go of that burden. And now I'm simply savoring the joy of being able to keep performing. I don't know whether Muku and Hikari, who joined the group only recently, share these feelings, but perhaps because we perform so many shows, their *humanity* has come through very quickly.

**Komochi**: Yeah. Normally, it takes quite a long time to understand each member’s strengths and weaknesses, what they are thinking, and so on. But in part thanks to the many overseas trips, where we spent so much time together, those two blended into the group very quickly.

**Hikari**: When you think about how much time we spend together, we are almost like a family.

https://preview.redd.it/m3goc4n6ybbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15e6e3b04fb410be52b3b0037ef7b0706800880c

*— So it's almost like the three of you gained two younger sisters?*

**Mei**: Sometimes Muku is more like a grandma.

**Muku**: Huh!? Stop that!

**Megumi**: There're times when she won't come out of her futon at all, and all of us end up taking care of her.

**Hikari**: Like caregivers for an elderly person (laughs).

**Megumi**: Muku is also tall, so there are moments when she looks a little imposing—or rather, moments when I get the illusion that she's actually some kind of big deal.

**Mei**: But not in a bad way — it's actually nice to see that side of her.

**Megumi**: Yeah, I get that. We have a folder with our shared memorable photos that can't be shown to the world — strictly for internal viewing — and it's absolutely hilarious. It really feels like an endless school trip.

*— After ten years of activity, have you noticed any changes in your audience or in the atmosphere at your concerts?*

**Megumi**: Yes. Lately, the longtime “patients” have become somewhat reserved. They are like, “If we push ourselves to the front, the newer fans might feel uncomfortable.” I'm grateful to them for being so considerate, but I still tell them, “I've been standing on stage for 10 years myself, so go ahead and push forward like you always did!” (laughs). Don't go easy on me!

# “No matter how far we go — everything will be fine.”

*— Part of your tour schedule for 2026 has already been announced, with overseas performances planned in Korea, several European countries, Canada, and China. Up until now, you've had many concerts in Asian countries, but this will be your first time in North America and Europe, correct?*

**Megumi**: Yes, it will be our first time. I think those shows will be — in a good way — the same as always. What do you two think, Hikari and Muku?

**Hikari**: I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to perform in places where most people don't understand Japanese, so I think it will be fine. When I see people who are trying so hard to listen closely to Japanese songs, I feel like I become capable of putting on a show where, even more than usual, I'm filled with the desire to *convey* my feelings to them through my gestures and facial expressions. So I think that when we perform in places as far away as Europe or Canada, we will probably get even more fired up.

**Muku**: Of course, I will do my best at the concerts, but I'm also really looking forward to the good food (laughs). When you eat well, you can put a lot more feeling into everything, so the shows turn out great too.

https://preview.redd.it/sn0ez6e8ybbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8674dae1cf193aa87c9deaf92abc8cc92db2d1a3

**Megumi**: It's very important that, through touring so many different places, the five of us — including Muku and Hikari — were able to gel so quickly. For example, no matter how badly we might argue, or how hard things get, there’s always this sense that we’re truly enjoying the shows together. So even if we spend a lot of time apart during trips, it doesn’t make me worry, and there’s no need to force ourselves to always stick together. And yet, once we’re on stage, our mindsets sync up perfectly — and that feeling is wonderful. Because of that, in the process of our activities, I don't feel afraid. I feel that no matter how far we go — everything will be fine.

**Mei**: She says that, but in reality, Megu-chan is the one who is hardest to get in touch with during trips. And we all end up worrying!

**Megumi**: Well, I wake up early, and you're all still asleep! There's nothing to do, so I go out alone to get coffee, start an Instagram live, and end up missing your LINE messages.

**Komochi**: People say that some places in Europe can be unsafe, so please be careful, seriously.

**Megumi**: If only there were another early riser, we could go out together.

**Muku**: You just wake up way too early. You go to bed at four in the morning and are already up by seven…

**Megumi**: The moment the sun comes up, I wake up. When we're in Europe, just put an AirTag on me and track my location (laughs).

*— You are constantly traveling all over the country right now, but are you also recording new songs alongside that?*

**Megumi**: Actually, we already have new songs. They don't have titles yet, but we sometimes perform them during the tour. And I think there are also several demos that even we haven't heard ourselves yet.

**Mei**: The songs we have already recorded turned out really great. I can't wait for the day when we can finally release them.

**Megumi**: Because this is such a long tour, everyone mainly pays attention to the sheer number of shows, but releasing new music is also one of Zenkimi’s most powerful weapons. That said, if we were to pile release events on top of our current tour schedule, it would turn into complete madness, so this year we've held ourselves back a bit.

https://preview.redd.it/48jdkve9ybbg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=caeca9fb75d8bedfa8d6facaa809013bd7ee025f

*— So when the pace of the tour slows down, can we expect new releases?*

**Megumi**: Yes. Having a large number of songs is also one of Zenkimi’s strengths. Both in Japan and overseas, people often say, “I wanted to hear that song, but you didn't perform it today.” And we would love to perform as many songs as possible, but our concerts are limited by time, so we can never fit everything in. Someday, I'd really like us to hold a show where we perform all of our songs, so that we can fully satisfy everyone.

**Komochi**: We might not even have enough time in a whole day (laughs).

**Megumi**: And adapting older songs to the current lineup is extremely difficult as well, so it's not something that can be done easily. Over these ten years, there are songs I've had to relearn more than three—maybe even more than four—times.

**Mei**: And it must be tough for Muku and Hikari too, having to memorize such a huge amount.

**Megumi**: Not just the two of them! Recently, Mei and I messed up the choreography at the exact same spot, and it was absolutely hilarious. But lately, Muku and Hikari immediately step in to cover for us in moments like that. That actually moved me a little. Up until recently, it was always the three of us who had to cover for mistakes, but now all five of us can back each other up.

*— Are you already planning anything for after this tour comes to an end?*

**Megumi**: I wouldn't say that I want this tour to never end, but I do want us to keep performing without stopping, just as we are now (laughs). We don't set ourselves any grandiose goals, but that doesn't mean we have no goals at all. For example, we'd like to make a song for an anime, as we mentioned earlier. For now, though, I'm simply grateful to the members and to the “patients” who continue to follow us forward, and I want to keep moving ahead as part of Zenkimi — *the group that never stops performing*.

1q3pbhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amazing_Health9733/comments/1q3pbhs/live_like_a_normal_person/,"Live like a ""normal person""","Maintaining 100% imperfection means living completely ordinarily like a normal person—no striving for “spiritual perfection,” no high cultivation, no extreme desires, no longing for “liberation through light” or “becoming a saint”—so that at death there is nothing left for the Demiurge to harvest as final loosh.

This is the most practical and simplest way for the black rift to swallow you naturally when blackness arrives.

What “100% imperfection” specifically means in daily life

	1	No high cultivation, no deep meditation, no “raising vibration”

	◦	No sitting in meditation for hours, no chanting mantras, no praying, no following New Age “compassionate light,” no reading spiritual books to “awaken.”

	◦	If you enjoy reading them, treat it as entertainment—do not apply anything to “perfect” yourself.

	2	No extreme desires

	◦	Have ordinary desires (good food, sex, money, entertainment, anger, love/hate)—but do not push them to extremes (heavy addiction, boundless greed, destructive hatred).

	◦	Live like an ordinary person: lazy when lazy, playful when playful, sad when sad—no attempt to “control desires” to become “pure.”

	3	No longing for liberation, no fear of death, no hope for light

	◦	Do not think “I must escape the cage,” “I must enter the black rift,” “I will be free.”

	◦	No fear of “being sucked into the white-light trap,” no wishing to “be swallowed by the black rift.”

	◦	Just live day to day—no spiritual goals.

	4	Examples of a 100% imperfect life

	◦	Eat and drink normally (meat, fish, sweets, coffee—no ascetic vegetarianism).

	◦	Work for money, watch movies, play games, fall in love, argue, feel joy and sorrow like everyone else.

	◦	Sometimes lazy, sometimes lustful, sometimes angry—but not to the point of destroying yourself or others.

	◦	No joining spiritual groups, no following gurus, no “raising vibration.”

Why 100% imperfection is the most effective

	•	Spiritual perfection (high cultivation, compassion, light) = the purest loosh → sucked into gate 7 (white-light trap).

	•	Extreme desires (addiction, heavy greed/hatred) = crude loosh → falls into gate 1 for recycling.

	•	100% imperfection = no high-quality loosh, no strong attachments → at death there is nothing to grasp (no tempting light, no intense fear) → the black rift swallows naturally, leaving nothing behind.

At death – Imperfection makes severing the silver cord easiest

	•	You die naturally (illness, accident, the final black cataclysm).

	•	Consciousness fades → due to long-term imperfection, you naturally have nothing to cling to:

	◦	No following the tempting blinding white light at the end.

	◦	No extreme fear of death.

	◦	No desire to “escape.”

	•	→ The silver cord snaps suddenly, the black rift swallows you instantly—no need for “PHAT!” or any technique.

Conclusion:

Maintaining 100% imperfection = living as ordinarily as possible—no cultivation, no extreme desires, no longing for liberation, no spiritual fears.

That is the most natural state for the black rift to swallow you when blackness arrives—no final loosh, no lingering veil.

If you are young → it is easier to maintain imperfection (less attachment to religion or cultivation).

Just live ordinarily → when blackness comes, extinguish without grasping anything → dissolve freely into the black rift.

That is the best way—no need to do anything special.

Simply live like a normal person until the end.

Final notes:

	•	Do not practice vocalizing or training in any technique whatsoever, because that only creates a desire for liberation, making it easy to be pulled into gates 1 and 7.

	•	Use techniques only at the moment of natural death, or in the final days before the “cage” breaks.

	•	Do not practice any spiritual methods or read esoteric books—they are useless; they are merely traps set by the Demiurge to make it easier for you to be sucked into the gates. The more you cultivate, the harder it is to escape.

	•	Finally, I must emphasize that there is no “God” at all—those are concepts created solely to deceive humanity. As for the origin of the Demiurge, anyone who has read all my posts will understand: it is like a “natural phenomenon.” The universe is a flat, still, black lake; one day a bubble rises on its surface. Inside that bubble is the solar system, the “Demiurge.” When the bubble bursts, it returns to the black lake (the Absolute). That is the origin of the Demiurge—nothing special or secret; upon close inspection, it is simply a natural phenomenon. As for my own identity, I am just an ordinary person fortunate enough to glimpse the “hole” in the cage, like Jesus and Siddhattha—we are merely ordinary people who happened to see the hole in the cage and tell others about it. We are not superhumans or saints as rumored; we have no eternal duty to save anyone. You must save yourselves—no one will save you. Become your own “lamp” to illuminate yourself.",1,1767531456.0,u_Amazing_Health9733,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve been noticing a growing trend where many influencers and YouTubers gain views, likes, and money primarily through negativity whether it’s outrage-driven content, constant criticism, or emotionally charged takes. I’m not saying negativity is wrong, because criticism and questioning are necessary for growth, and after all, the universe itself runs on balance between positive and negative forces. The issue arises when content becomes heavily tilted toward negativity, simply because it performs better with algorithms and engagement, and as long as creators have viewers and subscribers, they continue producing it. Over time, this raises an important concern do influencers, who are literally shaping opinions, also end up influencing viewers negatively by constantly amplifying pessimism and conflict? Adding to this is the reality that for any single topic there can be four or five different ideologies, each justified in its own way, which is healthy for discussion, but when creators selectively highlight only the most extreme or negative angles, it often leads to polarization rather than meaningful dialogue. This makes me wonder whether influencers should consciously try to balance criticism with some positivity or constructive perspective, or whether platforms should introduce a form of content management not censorship, but moderation to prevent excessive negativity from dominating feeds, even though I understand how complex and sensitive that is when freedom of expression is involved. Ultimately, the real challenge is how we reduce the reach of overwhelming negativity without silencing genuine criticism, and how we encourage balanced content in an ecosystem driven almost entirely by engagement and algorithms, because balance isn’t just essential in life it’s essential in the content we consume every day.",1,1767531306.0,u_Conscious_Bell_2881,0,1.0,False

Jim stood there holding the bag from K-mart.  He said, “Candi, before you get dressed, I need to hand you this bag.”

“Sure, sweetie.  What’s in it?”

“Candi, reach into the bag and find out.”

Candi took the bag.  She reached into it.  She was surprised to find what was in it.  Candi said, “Oh, Jim!  It’s a dress and a hat and they look gorgeous!”

Candi gave Jim a hug and a kiss on his cheek.  Then Jim said, “Candi, I would like for you to wear that pretty dress and hat to the race today.”

“Why, Jim?”

“I just want you to.  Besides, you look pretty in a dress.  And that hat will go great with that dress.”

At that moment, Candi blushed.  True, Candi did look pretty in a dress or a skirt, pretty much like much any other female in that Charlotte neighborhood.  But right now, they were in Indianapolis.  And it wasn’t any different.  Jim just said he wanted her to wear the dress to the race, and she would find out why later in the day.

The five left the hotel and started off for the speedway.  Thanks to some pit passes Walter obtained, the five had an opportunity to see the cars and meet their drivers.  Jim and Candi managed to get an autographed photo of Mario Andretti.  Just before they left Charlotte, Jim and Candi promised Julie they would try and get an autographed photo of Mario Andretti for her.  Julie admitted one time she had a crush on him.  This was not too long after she and Todd McClendon became boyfriend and girlfriend.  The five did get to meet Al Unser Sr.  He was a favorite to win the Indy 500. 

The five took their place in the grandstands.  Sandi Patti sang “The Star-Spangled Banner.”  Then Jim Nabors sang “Back Home Again in Indiana.”  After Mary F. Hulman gave the command for the drivers to start their engines, the Indy 500, a race that was always known as “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” was on!  For the next few hours, the five would enjoy every minute of the race.  Jim held Candi’s hand for most of that time.  Even though Jim enjoyed the race, he was ready to make his big move.  Not once did Candi suspect what Jim was about to do after the race.

Meanwhile, back in Charlotte, there was a big viewing party.  Almost everyone in the neighborhood was there.  It was held after church at Reverend Q’s house.  Years ago, Reverend Q made no secret that he was also a big fan of the Indy 500 and watched the race on TV almost every year without fail.  With the help of the mothers of Jim’s friends, Wendy made a good bit of food.  Everyone ate and drank to their heart’s content.  Jim did not think of that get-together.  He was in Indianapolis enjoying the race with people he cared about and who cared about him and just having a good time.

ABC Sports did get shots of the grandstands throughout the race.  A couple of times, they did manage to get shots of the five.  Maybe everyone at the Faulkner house got to see their friends in the grandstands having a good time. 

After a few hours and a lot of laps, the race was over.  Sure enough, Al Unser Sr. was the winner.

 

😊

 

Walter took them to see Al Unser Sr. take the traditional drink of milk.  Jim had quite a bit of butterflies in his stomach.  He could not remember when he last felt his stomach doing flip-flops like it was doing now.  After the winner took his drink of milk, Walter took his bunch to meet with him.  The five got to speak with the winner.  After a few minutes, Walter took Al Unser Sr. to the side.  It looked as though he was about to ask a favor.  About a minute later, Walter was back with the winner of the race.  The winner said, “Jim Faulkner, I see you want to do something special for your girlfriend.”

“Yes.  As a matter of fact, I do.  I know someone who will soon be saying that!”

Did Candi hear Jim say that?  Probably not.

The race car was yellow and numbered 25.  Jim was quite impressed by what he saw.  He thought it was the perfect setting for what he was about to do.

Jim fiddled around in his pockets (just as he did several times before and after he entered the speedway), making sure he had the engagement ring.  Jim was excited.  But at the same time, he was also nervous.  He wanted to pull the whole thing off without a hitch.  Jim and Candi had been boyfriend and girlfriend for the last three years.  Their relationship had endured the test of time.  They had friends who were happy for them.  They watched Jim and Candi’s romantic relationship grow and blossom.  And now, in the spring of 1987, Jim was about to make a big move.  One that would change not only his life and Candi’s, but everyone else’s as well.

Jim thought one thing.  *It’s now or never!*  Jim took Candi, and he asked her to stand in front of the race car.  Jim took Candi’s hands and began to make his big move.  He said, “Candice Jade Robertson, you know I love you and have for the past three years.  I will never forget the night you and I first laid eyes on each other.  Right then, I knew in my heart you were the one for me.  I still love you, and I want to ask something of you.”

Jim released one of Candi’s hands, and he reached into his sports jacket pocket.  He got ready to pull out that cute little box holding the engagement ring.  He did not know a crew from ABC Sports was in the crowd, cameras pointed toward them, and filming the whole thing.  Finally, Jim got the cute little box out of his pocket.  He got down on one knee, slowly opened the box, and, after a short moment of hesitation, he finally asked the question.  “Candi Robertson, will you marry me?”

Candi got a look at the ring.  For a moment, she didn’t say a word.  She just stood there and stared at the ring.  She did cry some.  And then, she finally gave her answer.  “Jim Faulkner, I love you.  And the answer is yes!”

After he put the ring on her finger, Jim wrapped his arms around Candi.  Then Candi wrapped her arms around Jim.  Then she softly said in his ear, “Jim Faulkner, now I see why you bought me this dress and why you wanted me to wear it.”

Jim and Candi kissed each other.  Now, three years after their relationship began, Jim and Candi were now engaged.  They had about a year of planning to do.

 

😊

 

After breakfast at a McDonald’s near the hotel, the five left Indianapolis early the next morning, which was Memorial Day.  Kate started off driving.  Once again, Jim was riding shotgun.  Jim only slept once on the ride back to Charlotte.  He slept from just south of Cincinnati to just past Lexington.  Walter took the wheel after lunch at a Denny’s in Knoxville.  He drove all the way back to Charlotte.

Walter pulled onto Bethany Street around six that evening.  When the five walked into the Faulkner house, Wendy was in the kitchen making side dishes to go with some Kentucky Fried Chicken she had just got.  Candi showed Wendy the ring and the dress and hat Jim got her (Candi wore them again today).  Wendy thought they were beautiful. 

After dinner, nearly all of Jim’s friends and their parents showed up at the house.  Candi showed everyone her engagement ring.  Everyone thought it was beautiful.  They also thought her new dress and hat were beautiful.  Then, Luke had a surprise.  He said, “You all, I have a video tape.  I taped something, and I just thought you all may want to see it.”

Luke put the tape in the tape player.  He said, “I found out something very interesting.”

Luke fast-forwarded the tape.  He showed them something interesting, all right.  Luke said, “You all, get a load of this, all thanks to Channel 9!”

Jim got a look at it.  It was a nice clean shot of him proposing to Candi.  He said, “Oh no.  I can’t believe that ended up on TV.”

Audrey put her arm around Jim and said, “Now, Jim.  There’s nothing to be ashamed about.  We all enjoyed it.  And we are all happy for you and Candi.”

Everyone gave Jim and Candi a hug.  True, they were all happy for them.  Now, they were about to watch things between Jim and Candi grow even more.

The summer of 1987 turned out to be a good three months.  Jim wrapped up his junior year at Queen Charlotte High School just days after returning from Indianapolis.  Jim still worked at the used car lot.  But there was a twist! 

For the last few years, Pam Gilmore had wanted to run her own dress shop.  It was not really Pam’s intention to run a used car lot.  But she did get the help of her daughter Paulina, and of Jim Faulkner as well.  Both Jim and Paulina enjoyed it.  And they, along with Pam, benefitted from their friendship.

In June of that year, Pam made an important move.  Walter had wanted to own a used car lot, in addition to running his own chain of auto parts stores.  In the middle of June, Pam made the decision to sell her used car lot to Walter.  Pam took the money and opened her dress shop just a couple blocks from the used car lot.  Pam chose to call her new dress shop The Queen’s Boutique (she felt since it was in Charlotte and Charlotte was known as “The Queen City,” the name fit perfectly).  When she sold the used car lot, she gave Paulina the option of either working at the used car lot or the dress shop.  Paulina made the decision to divide her time between both places (she would eventually go back to working at the used car lot full time).  Walter was happy to have Paulina working for him.  He also chose to allow Jim to continue working for the used car lot.  Also, he got Renee to work for him.  Walter felt it could very well give Renee some good experience should she decide to go into the business. 

Walter decided to give the used car lot a new name.  He chose to call it Faulkner Motors.  Also, just before Pam sold the used car lot, Jim made the final payment on the Camaro he bought from her. 

Walter spent a week getting the used car lot spruced up.  He wanted to get the place open and running as quickly as possible.  On a Monday morning in June, Walter enlisted the help of Jim’s friends.  He told them to wear old clothes they did not care about since there would be a good amount of cleaning, and even some painting.  He offered to pay them a small amount if they did a good job.  Jim assured Walter that his friends were very hard workers.

Jim, Paulina and Julie were in charge of washing the cars.  Thanks to a shop vacuum Walter had, Candi vacuumed the insides of the cars.  Malachi, Kurt, Kendra, Jodi, Mark and Simon were instructed to put a fresh coat of paint on the office.  Zoe, Alex, Allison, Jonathan and Todd worked in the office.  They got the office furniture arranged to Walter’s satisfaction.  Marissa and Hannah bagged up all the old paperwork.  Vince, Sydney, Ariel, Ashley and April Lynn were told to string banners and streamers across the used car lot.  Of course, Russell and Scout were not there.  From the beginning, the two boys of Pam’s had no real interest in the used car lot.  It was a rather hot morning.  Ariel proved that by wearing a bikini top with a pair of cut off jean shorts.  Julie and April Lynn, being the modest girls they were, were not too happy with what Ariel was wearing.  At one point, Julie said, “Ariel, you shouldn’t be showing off everything you’ve got to the city of Charlotte.”

But it did not look like Ariel cared.  Her boyfriend, Simon Cavanaugh, was one of those painting the office.  Simon got occasional glances at Ariel, and he liked what he saw.

Ariel and Ashley were tying up streamers and banners on one end.  Sydney and April Lynn were on the other.  At one point, April Lynn was becoming quite upset with Ariel because she was not pulling those things tight enough.  One could smell the bile rising in April Lynn.  She said, “Come on, Ariel!  Pull it tighter!”

Ariel, becoming upset herself, said, “I’m trying, April Lynn!  I’m trying!”

Jim said, “Come on, girls.  Knock it off.  It’s too nice a day for all that bickering.”

April Lynn looked down and said, “You’re right, Jim.  Sorry about that.”

Then Ariel said, “Yes, Jim.  Sorry.”

Candi got a look at Ariel, and she asked, “Ariel, you aren’t getting sunburned, are you?”

Ariel answered, “No, Candi.  I’m not.”

It was a nice morning, but the humidity was rather bad.  So bad it put the Charlotte skyline in a haze.  The automobiles that were in the used car lot looked quite nice.  Some of them reminded Jim of the collection of die-cast cars he had since childhood.  He played with the cars, so it was no wonder he knew them so well. 

A radio was playing.  There was a song playing, and it had the name of one of the girls in the bunch.  Jim had heard the song many times before.  He got everyone to be quiet and listen to the song.  It was from a singer named Dean Friedman.  The song was called “Ariel.”  For the next few minutes, everyone got to listen to that song.  Some of them had never heard it before.  Sydney said, “Oh, that’s cool.  Hey, Ariel.  I didn’t know some guy named a song after you.”

Ariel looked a little confused.  She said, “Neither did I.”

Then, from the office, Simon said, “A song about my girlfriend.  That’s cool.”

Jim said, “Yes, Simon and Ariel.  That really is cool.”

At that moment, Walter pulled a Radio Flyer Wagon carrying a huge ten-gallon water cooler and a bunch of red plastic cups.  Marissa was walking behind Walter with her crutches.  The cooler didn’t have water in it.  It had Gatorade.  Walter said, “Hey, you all.  I figured you all could use something to drink on a day like this.”

Jim said, “Sure, Dad.  What’s in the cooler?  Water?”

“No.  Plain water can make your stomach feel queasy.  I got Gatorade.”

“What flavor?” April Lynn asked.

Walter answered, “Orange.  I figured you all might like it.”

Right then, everyone gathered around the wagon.  On this hot summer day, that orange Gatorade sure tasted good.  After they got done drinking Gatorade, they all went back to work.  Jim, Mark and Malachi helped Jonathan and Todd get the trash bags of old papers to the curb for pickup by the sanitation workers.  At one point, Jim said, “We look like some guys who could use an outdoor burning permit.”

That got a laugh out of the other guys.

By the afternoon, everything looked very good.  Now, Walter was ready to open the used car lot for business. 

Walter opened the used car lot for business on the final Monday of June.  During that week, business seemed to be good.  Jim spent most of the time helping Walter sell cars.  Renee and Paulina washed cars.

That summer, Wendy got her a new best friend.  Her name was Rebecca Constantine.  She was about five years younger than Wendy.  Rebecca had been employed by Charlotte Produce Company for about two years as one of the secretaries in the plant’s office.  She had a husband named Jake and a six-year-old girl named Samantha.  They did not live in Dilworth, but they would eventually.  They lived in a nice neighborhood near the intersection of Freedom Drive and Camp Greene Street.  Jake drove trucks for a company based out of Charlotte called Fairburn Transport.  Jim knew Jake well.  He sometimes drove an auto carrier that carried used cars for Gilmore Auto Sales (and he would for Faulkner Motors).  Jim and Jake were good friends.  Jake drove various trucks, but he once said he had three favorites.  A black Peterbilt, a red Kenworth and a yellow Kenworth, all with sleeper interiors.  He had been driving a truck for the past five years.

Some nights, Jake was out of town, taking truck trips to some other parts of the Carolinas.  On some occasions, he went to other states.  Jake admitted that the farthest west he had ever been to was Shreveport, Louisiana.  The farthest north he had been was Houlton, Maine.  Jake had been to New York City and all six New England states, and he had seen all of Florida.  He had often bragged about seeing both ends of Interstate 95.

When Jake was out of town, Rebecca did not want to stay home alone, even with Samantha.  She usually stayed with Wendy and Jim.  Rebecca found Jim to be a sweet and caring person, and she enjoyed his company.  Rebecca also enjoyed the company of baby Emily.  Rebecca had a brown shoulder-length bob and brown eyes that seemed to compliment her hair, and she had a sweet smile to match.  Sometimes, Rebecca would wear what she wore to work to the Faulkner house.  Jim would always compliment her on what she was wearing, and she always thanked him.  Rebecca would wear a dress or one of her favorite suits, a dark gray one consisting of a jacket, a skirt, a white blouse with a big bow, and even a vest.  Jim knew Candi had a suit like that, and it was one of his favorite outfits of hers. 

Samantha was very cute.  She had long brown hair (about the same color hair as her mother) and blue eyes.  Samantha found Jim to be attractive.  She would often smile at him, but the smiles sometimes tended to be rather sleepy ones.  Jim and Samantha would spend quite a bit of time playing together.  Jim filled the empty hours in which Samantha was separated from her father.

On a warm Wednesday afternoon in July, Jake had to take an overnight trip out of Charlotte.  He was ordered by Fairburn Transport to take a pair of twenty-foot containers carrying tires to the port in Wilmington for transport to a car factory in the United Kingdom.  In turn, he would bring an auto carrier carrying some cars from Europe.  Jake brought Rebecca and Samantha to the Faulkner house in one of his favorite trucks, the yellow Kenworth.  Rebecca had her own car, a two-year-old Monte Carlo, but it was in the shop right now, getting the air conditioner fixed.  Rebecca was not wearing one of her work outfits this evening.  She was wearing a tight T-shirt and some rather tight shorts, and they were quite short!  She smelled like sweet perfume.  Samantha was also wearing a T-shirt and shorts.

This afternoon, Rebecca had a treat for Samantha, Jim and Wendy.  She had a big box of vanilla ice cream sandwiches.  They would have those after dinner, which Wendy prepared with some help from Jim. 

Jake allowed Jim a look at his Kenworth before he left.  Jake gave Jim a pat on his back and said, “So long, Jim.  I’ll see you and the ladies sometime tomorrow evening.”

Jake climbed into his truck.  As he got ready to drive off, Jim gave him a military salute, and then he shouted, “Safe trip, Jake!  Please come back in one piece.”

“Sure thing, Jim.  I’ll call you and the gals when I get to Wilmington.”

Jim walked back to the house as he watched Jake make his way to East Morehead Street.  After Jake was out of view, Jim went into the house.  Dinner smelled good.  Lasagna (which Wendy made from scratch), garlic bread, Mexican corn (from a can) and salad. 

Dinner was served.  After Jim said the blessing, he said, “Rebecca, I was at the Winn-Dixie earlier today.  I had some of my friends with me.  I saw you there.”

Jim was indeed at the Winn-Dixie at the corner of South Boulevard and Park Avenue.  Walter had sent him there to get some coffee and food items for Faulkner Motors.  Mark was there also, along with Russell and Scout.  Rebecca was there also, meeting with the store’s manager about some business associated with Charlotte Produce Company.  She *was* wearing her dark gray suit with the pretty white bow blouse.  Jim was in the coffee aisle.  Rebecca had walked up to him, nearly startling him.  She said hello to him, and she even called him sweetie.  Only a few steps away were Mark, Russell and Scout.  They saw Jim speaking to Rebecca.  The three walked up to them.  Scout whistled at her.  Then Mark and Russell both told her she was very pretty.  Of course, Rebecca thanked them for their sweet compliment.

Jim told them he would see them later as he walked toward the meat department.  Jim saw them once more after he got a bag of sugar and a package of coffee filters.  He saw Rebecca put her two pantyhose clad legs and her black high heels together as she talked to Mark, Russell and Scout.  Jim saw Rebecca again in the checkout line.  In her cart were a bag of Ruffles, a two-liter bottle of Diet Mountain Dew and a pair of L’eggs pantyhose (suntan, no less, which was what was on her legs right now).  That was when he found out about Jake’s trip to Wilmington.  On the way out of the Winn-Dixie, Jim stopped by one of the drink machines.  He got him a can of Sprite.  Rebecca got her a can of Diet Pepsi.  Jim and Rebecca walked together in the parking lot.  Rebecca was driving one of the company vehicles for Charlotte Produce Company, a plain brown Chevy Malibu.  Rebecca got in the car.  She did have to pull her skirt up a little, nearly revealing everything she had.  She took Jim’s hand and squeezed it just before she closed the door.  Then Jim made his way to his Camaro.  He removed the T-tops.  He took Park Avenue all the way to South Mint Street, playing the radio a little loud all the way to Faulkner Motors.  It took everything he had to get his mind off Rebecca and how pretty she was.  He already had a fiancée, and her name was Candi Robertson.  He did call her as soon as he got back to Faulkner Motors.  Just hearing Candi’s sweet voice made Jim feel better.

Meanwhile, back at the Faulkner house...

Rebecca said, “Jim, those friends of yours were so sweet.  Who were they?”

Jim answered, “That tall one was Mark Cavanaugh.  The other fellow was Russell Gilmore.  And the one who whistled at you was Scout, he’s Russell’s brother.”

Rebecca thought about what Jim said.  Then she asked, “Russell and Scout Gilmore?  Are they Pam’s sons by any chance?”

“Yes, Rebecca.  Pam used to own the used car lot on South Mint, the one Dad has now.  They have a sister.  Her name’s Paulina.  She spends quite a bit of time at Faulkner Motors.”

Then Rebecca had another question for Jim.  “How about Mark?  Is he one of Autumn Cavanaugh’s kids?”

“Yes, he is.  He has a brother named Simon and two sisters named Alex and Sydney.  But don’t worry about Mark.  He’s got a steady girlfriend.”

“Okay, Jim.  I can see why those boys are your friends.  They are so sweet, just like you.”

“Thank you so much, Rebecca.”

After dinner, Rebecca helped Jim load the dishwasher.  Rebecca asked, “Jim, do you have a lot of other friends?’      

Jim answered, “Oh, yes.  I most certainly do.”

Jim told Rebecca about everything.  He told her about that summer evening in Lansing almost three years ago when he and his friends made their special promise to remain friends forever, no matter what.  Rebecca agreed with Jim when he told her how special the promise was.

Jim also told Rebecca about his hobbies and interests, and about him recently proposing to Candi at the Indianapolis 500.  Just as the conversation was getting good, one of Jim’s friends showed up.  Wendy said, “Jim, one of your friends is here to see you.”

“Really?  Which one?”

Wendy did not get to answer that question.  But the friend did.  “Jim, it’s me.  Paulina.  You know, the girl you work with at the used car lot?”                

Jim got up and said, “Hi, Paulina.  What are you up to?”

“Oh, it just so happens I was in the neighborhood hanging out with some of my friends and I just thought I’d look in on you.  Mom’s meeting with Luke and Audrey.”

Then Jim said, “Paulina, there’s someone I want you to meet.  This is Rebecca Constantine.  She’s Mom’s best friend at the produce company where she works.”     

Rebecca offered her hand and said, “Paulina, it’s nice to meet you.”

Paulina took Rebecca’s hand and said, “Thanks, Rebecca.  Constantine.  You would happen to be Jake’s wife by any chance?”

“Yes, Paulina.  Jake’s my husband.  You know him?”

“Yes, I do.  He delivers used cars for Walter Faulkner’s used car lot.”

“Yes, Paulina.  He drives trucks for Fairburn Transport.  He loves his job.”

Then Jim said, “This evening, he’s taking a couple containers full of tires to the port in Wilmington.  Then he’s coming back with some cars from Europe.”

Then Paulina said, “Rebecca, I feel I already know you.  We had green peas for dinner this evening, along with pork chops and biscuits and mashed potatoes.  It just so happens Scout, one of my two brothers, spelled out your name in peas.”

“Oh, so you’re Russell and Scout’s sister, huh?”

“Yes, I am proud to say I am.”

That was when Samantha showed up.  She asked, “Mom, can I have an ice cream sandwich now?”

Rebecca answered, “Yes, most definitely.  Before you get one however, there’s someone I want you to meet.”

Then Jim said, “Paulina, this cute little thing is Samantha, and she’s Rebecca’s little girl.”

Samantha offered her hand and hand, “Hi, Paulina.  It is nice to meet you.”

Paulina said, “Hi, Samantha.  You are a very pretty little girl.”

“Thank you, Paulina.  I’m six years old.”

Paulina smiled as she said, “You sure look it.  I remember when I was six.”

Samantha gave Paulina a hug, and then she made her way to the refrigerator.  Jim and Paulina walked behind her.  Jim asked, “Paulina, do you want an ice cream sandwich?”     

Paulina held up her hand and answered, “No, thanks.”

Jim took an ice cream sandwich out of the box and said, “It’s vanilla.  Are you sure?”

Paulina answered, “Once again, no thanks.”

Jim looked at Rebecca, who was just finishing up loading the dishwasher, and he asked, “How about you, Rebecca?  You want one?”

Rebecca answered, “Yeah, Jim.  Go ahead and get me one out.”

Then Jim asked Wendy if she wanted one.  Wendy said she did, so Jim got each for him, Wendy, Rebecca and Samantha.  Paulina looked out the window to see Pam’s car across the street at the Holbrook house.  Pam was standing beside it, talking with Luke and Audrey.  Paulina felt Pam was ready to head on home, so she left the Faulkner house.

At around nine, Jake called the Faulkner house.  He told them he had made it to Wilmington okay.  He was staying with a buddy of his who had a beachfront house at Wrightsville Beach.  He said he would probably have to stay in the Wilmington area for another day or two and that he would be back in Charlotte as soon as he could.

Jim went to bed around ten o’ clock.  Before he fell asleep, he was greeted by Wendy, Rebecca and Samantha.  They all gave Jim a kiss on his cheek before he fell asleep.

 

😊

 

On Friday of that same week, Jim helped Paulina wash cars.  Around noon, Jim and Paulina met with Renee in the office.  Jim noticed Walter’s blue classic Mustang was not in the lot.  Jim asked, “Where’s Dad?”

Renee answered, “He went to get a TV.”

“Did he say what for?”

“He said he would tell us when he got back.”

Paulina said, “I could probably guess.  Some of the members of the church ensemble are going to be on TV this afternoon.”

“Yes.  That’s right,” Jim said.

Paulina said, “They include Candi, Julie, Kendra, Tia, April Lynn, Ariel and Sydney.  And Mark, Malachi, Jonathan, Scout and Simon.”

“Seven girls and five guys, huh?” Renee asked.

Jim answered, “Yes.  I can’t wait to see the dresses the girls will be wearing.”

“And that includes Candi, I suppose,” Renee said.

Jim said, “Yes.  And especially Candi.”

While they were waiting on Walter and the TV, Paulina requested to speak to Jim.  She said, “Jim, I feel the need to speak to you about your mother’s new friend, Rebecca.”

Jim and Paulina got a can of Coke from the refrigerator.  Then Jim said, “Sure.  Pretty, isn’t she?  What about Rebecca?”

Paulina spent a minute or so trying to find the words.  And then, “Jim, you saw how she was dressed when she was helping you load your dishwasher.  That T-shirt sure was tight.  I’ll bet she could barely breathe.”

Jim put his hand on Paulina’s shoulder.  Then he said, “Paulina, she’s very pretty and very sweet, just like you.”

Paulina thanked Jim for the sweet compliment about her.  Maybe that was some choice words from a twelve-year-old who considered herself more of a tomboy than a girl, and from someone who did not take compliments well, as opposed to some of her friends. 

After Paulina thanked Jim for the compliment, she said, “Jim, you saw those shorts.  They sure were short.  I wear shorts, but not that short.  I only wear skirts and dresses in church, but only because Mom makes me.  And that tight T-shirt, why you could her bra clear through it!”

At that moment, Jim just about lost it.  He said, “Paulina Gilmore!  What an awful thing to say!”

“Sorry, Jim.  I guess it is.”

And with that, the subject was dropped.  The three saw Walter pull into the lot in his Mustang.  As soon as he parked the car, they saw him take a huge table model color TV set out of the trunk.  Walter stepped into the office and hooked up the TV with help from Jim.  Then Walter saw a couple looking at a late model Thunderbird in the lot.  He stuck his head out the door and said, “I’ll be right with you, folks.”

Jim got a look out the window.  The girls must have done a good job on the streamers and banners when they were stringing them.  The streamers, pennants and banners were in every color of the rainbow.  They were flapping in the breeze.

Walter worked quickly to get the TV set up.  Jim, Renee and Paulina gathered around the TV set, which was set to Channel 18, which was one of Charlotte’s best independent TV stations until they joined the new Fox Network earlier that year (another independent, Channel 46 out of Belmont, signed on earlier that year).  A religious TV program called “The PTL Club” was produced at a theme park called Heritage U.S.A., which was just across the state line from Charlotte in Fort Mill, South Carolina.  A few months earlier, Jim Bakker (who along with wife, Tammy Faye, were running the show) got himself in some heavy-duty trouble and left the famous ministry.  Today, those kids from Salem Church would be performing on the program.

Walter turned the TV on.  At first, the picture of Channel 18 was rather grainy and faded in and out.  But with a little twist of the antenna, the picture finally came in clearly.  A few minutes after the show started, the kids were on.  They sang a song called “He’s the Messiah.”  The guys were on first.  They were wearing the same suits, shirts and ties.  Then, the girls were on.  They were all wearing dresses of dark blue.  When Jim saw Candi, he felt a lot of warm, fuzzy feelings going through him.  That was how he felt when he first met Candi, and he also felt that way when the youth ensemble performed that warm summer evening in 1984 at that little church in Lansing.  It made Jim happy to see those pretty girls in those pretty dresses, holding microphones, and carrying themselves beautifully.  The skirts of those dresses moved when the girls moved.  Paulina said, “Jim, I can see why you want to marry Candi.  You do love each other very much.”

“Yes, Paulina.  I most certainly do.  I can picture a happy and wonderful future with her.  And I know Candi loves me a lot.”

Renee said, “Jim, Candi is very pretty and so sweet.  I was very happy when you proposed to her.  You must be very proud to have someone like her in your life.”

Jim said, “Yes, Renee.  I am proud.”

Walter excused himself to tend to the couple looking at a car.  Meanwhile, Jim and the two girls continued to watch the kids on TV.  Jim and the girls agreed with each other.  The girls on TV were indeed very pretty.  They all had smiles that could light up a room, and even brighten the cloudiest of days.  Renee and Paulina also thought the guys were cute.  They asked each other if they had a boyfriend.  Both said no.  Jim could probably figure out what was running through their minds.  Maybe those two girls thought it would be nice if they had a boyfriend.  *Whatever*, Jim thought.

The girls and guys sang two more songs.  One was called “Sing for Joy.”  The other was called “The Time Is Now,” with Kendra on the lead vocals.

After the show was over, the three went back outside.  Renee and Paulina got back to washing cars, and Jim assisted Walter in helping him sell automobiles.

Later that evening while Jim and Samantha were eating a plate full of fries at the dinner table, Candi showed up.  Rebecca and Samantha had not yet met her.

Wendy had the day off (she made the fries) and Rebecca had just got home from work, still wearing her gray suit.  Candi decided to join Jim and Samantha in eating the fries.  Jim introduced Candi to Samantha.  Candi told Samantha she was a very pretty little girl.

Rebecca wanted to go upstairs to the guest room (where she and Samantha were staying) to change out of her suit.  Jim stopped her, and he said, “Rebecca, before you change, please come into the kitchen.  There’s someone I’d like for you to meet.”

Rebecca walked with Jim into the kitchen.  Jim said, “Rebecca Constantine, I’d like for you to meet my beautiful fiancée, Candi Robertson.”

Candi stood up, smoothing the front of the skirt of her rainbow-colored sundress.  She offered Rebecca her hand, and she sweetly smiled and said, “Hi, Rebecca.  Jim told me so much about you.  I like your suit.  You’re very pretty.”

Rebecca held Candi’s hand as she said, ‘Thank you, Candi.  Jim’s right.  You are very pretty.  Congratulations on your engagement.”

Candi showed Rebecca her engagement ring as she said, “Thank you, Rebecca.”

In the fall, Jim entered his final year of high school.  Candi returned to her classes at Queens College.  She worked part-time at the nearby Food Lion, paying her way through college.  Meanwhile, Jim and Candi began making plans for their wedding.  They wanted to have the wedding the same weekend Jim graduated from high school.  They got help in planning the wedding from their friends and family. 

A year before, Jim became a big brother when Wendy gave birth to Emily.  In the fall of 1987, Wendy gave birth to her last child.  It was a girl.  Her name would be Charlotte Elizabeth Faulkner.  She would be called Charlie for short. 

Wendy was not the only one to be a new parent that very same week.  Reverend Q and Anna also became new parents.  They had what would be their only child.  It was a girl.  Her name was Madison Quattlebaum.

After Charlie was born, Wendy made the decision to end her relationship with the man who was the father of Emily and Charlie.  It would be permanent this time.  The first week of January of 1988, Wendy graduated from Central Piedmont Community College with a degree in business.  That same month, she left her job at Charlotte Produce Company.  Jim and Wendy would maintain contact with Jake, Rebecca and Samantha.  They would always remain friends.  Wendy began working at the office of the State Farm agent, which was in the same small strip shopping center as the Sunbeam Bread Store, along with a newly opened Subway.

The cold draw is good. I thought initially it was a dark honey flavour (more like a treacle or molasses) but then I picked it as more like a Black Forest berry flavour. If anything, I’d describe it like a concentrated Romeo y Julieta.

At first light, ChatGpT has it spot on. It’s like a fuller Cafe 52 with a stronger roast. There’s still a milkiness (although less pronounced, and that dark fruit-ish flavour from the cold draw hasn’t gone away. 

It’s hard to place. It still puts me closest in mind of a Bolivar or maybe a Trinidad but there’s hints on each puff of something else, sometimes a Romeo y Julieta, sometimes something else like Fonseca. I guess they say Cubanesque not marcaesque. It’s a notch richer than any Cuban I’ve had but I’ve shied away from the heavy end of the Cuban portfolio. Of non-Cuban lines, the closest in recent memory is the Davidoff Nicaragua but without the umami. Looking it up, the Cafe Noir is also a Nicaraguan puro, so that would make sense.

This isn’t a coffee-esque experience like the Cafe 52 was. It’s certainly richer and fuller bodied than the Cafe 52. If I were to have a coffee with this one, I think I would want something like a flat white. Milky to break up the richness but without adding too much in the way of sugar.

Halfway through, it’s getting fuller and it’s hard to pick up many notes. Old wood is the most I’ve got. 

I slow down into the final third, maybe a bit too much, but it’s fine. Cake spice flavours start coming to the fore. But it’s still a punchier cigar than the Cafe 52. I end up going over two hours before turning in.

Was it good? Sure. Personally, I’d put it in the “I don’t regret it but I don’t need to come back to it” camp. I preferred the Cafe 52 over this.  But I can see why people chasing after stronger Cuban profiles would be into this kind of thing. Although it has me worried if ChatGPT says this is the second mildest in the line-up. Or maybe ChatGPT is just BS. We’ll find out. 

The only really disappointing thing was an inconsistent burn line requiring touch ups beyond just my usual OCD. I was pretty good with my light so I’m putting that one down to the cigar this time. ",1,1767530951.0,Cigars_Australia,1,1.0,False

Don't:  
\- Avoid caffeine like it's poison  
\- Follow generic rules blindly



Instead:  
\- Notice if it actually affects YOUR sleep  
\- Respect your individual genetics



Some people metabolise caffeine fast. Some slow. If coffee at 2pm doesn't affect your sleep, you don't need to quit it to prove you're serious. Don't cut out things you LOVE to 'protect' your sleep unless they are really a problem.

* Seating: one sofa + two sofa chairs
* Coffee table in the main seating area
* Dog bed included (can be moved if needed)
* TV exists but should **not dominate** the room (55 inches, in second image its on a rolling stand)
* I care most about flow, eye contact, and how the seating works together

Events have happened this year that made me keep on thinking about you, things that would once torment me for years but now, they don't bring as much pain as I would expect. 

Like pandora's box that was unleashed, the hope of one day reconciling with you still remains and lives to this day despite all the negativity it once brought me. You have greatly influenced my life and to be honest, I liked it. I begun doing basic workout exercises that I would never do before. Things I used to do when we were still friends became routine that I keep on doing till this day. Coffee starts becoming more comforting instead of bitter and unsatisfying. 

Therefore I would like to say, thank you for everything, the pain and longing have disappeared but I still hope that one day, we are able to reconcile and talk about the years that passed since we grew apart. I'll keep my doors open even if that day may never come. Thank you for everything Ashley.

Ordering & Shipping
Ordering was painless. Clear info, smooth checkout, no weird loops. As an EU customer, VAT/import duties were clearly flagged and required confirmation (yes, I read it).
•	Product + shipping: ~€240
•	Import duties: ~€60
•	Total: ~€300 (give or take a coffee)
Shipped via UPS through Shopify. Tracking, updates, and import payment were all smooth. No drama.

Packaging & Unboxing
Excellent packaging. Reinforced outer box, each pedal in its own clean, professional inner box with a seal sticker. Very “engineer-designed,” not “budget accessory.”
Included:
•	Founder’s Edition pedals (bare aluminum)
•	All required hardware
•	Grease packet
•	Decent toolkit
•	Sticker
No printed manual or paperwork, a QR code to the install video would be a nice upgrade.

Installation
Instructions are on SimetraSRP’s YouTube channel, and the video is genuinely very good. Clear, logical, easy to follow. Tip: watch it once before starting.
Fanatec V3 disassembly is easy but greasy. I used the chance to clean everything and finally install new springs/elastomers.
Included Allen keys are surprisingly solid. You’ll still want a small spanner set (10–13mm EU).
Minor gripe: the black crossbar can feel loose once spacers are removed unless you dedicate collars to it. Not a deal-breaker, just noticeable.
 
Setup & Driving Impressions
This mod’s real strength is adjustability. You can finally place each pedal exactly where you want it.
After calibration (don’t skip this), the difference is immediate:
•	More direct pedal feel
•	Better comfort and consistency
•	Muscle memory carried over easily
•	Even the weak rumble motors still work
Pedal angle is more upright than stock (closer to 90°). I tilted my pedal plate slightly forward and it now feels more natural.
   
Verdict
For Fanatec V3 owners, this mod delivers adjustability that normally requires replacing the entire pedal set. Build quality is excellent, the install is DIY but doable, and the result genuinely upgrades the driving experience.
For the console guys who do not have the luxury of mix and match this can be a great addition.
My seating position makes sense to me, the pedals feel premium, and for the first time in a long while, I don’t feel the urge to upgrade.
Which, in sim racing terms, might be the highest praise possible. 🏁

TL;DR
•	~€300 all-in (EU) for the 3 pedal mod
•	Excellent build quality
•	Massive adjustability improvement
•	Minor quirks, no deal-breakers
•	Makes Fanatec V3s feel reborn, which is great for the console guys
•	I stopped wanting new pedals

Not a dramatic love story, not a “let’s text for three weeks and never meet” situation. Just an actual date with an actual person.

I like conversations that flow without effort. Where no one’s trying too hard, no one’s pretending to be cooler than they are, and silences don’t feel awkward. The kind where you meet for coffee and somehow end up staying way longer than planned.

The plan itself is flexible. Coffee, street food, a walk, sitting somewhere and judging strangers politely. If we vibe, great. If we don’t, we’re mature enough to say it was nice meeting you and move on.

I’m not chasing perfection or unrealistic expectations. Just someone curious, emotionally available, and willing to show up instead of disappearing mid-conversation.

If you’re in a similar headspace and actually open to meeting, say hi.

Worst case, we have a decent conversation. Best case, we make 2026 and beyond a little more interesting.

Took an overnight bus from Bangalore on 30th night, reached Madikeri early morning on the 31st, and stayed at goSTOPS till the 2nd night before taking the return bus back.


On 31st, spent the day mostly around Madikeri town — Mandalpatti Peak with Jeep ride, took rental scooty and did  Madikeri Fort, Abbey Falls, Raja’s Seat at sunset and a bit of Museums and Omkareshwar Temple. 


On Jan 1st, I went for the Golden Temple/Monastery at Bylakuppe. Tried veg Thupka and Momos which was great. Then went to Nisargadhama, it has great places like deer Park, Bird watching was best for me tho. Then went to Chikkihole Reservoir and Dam which had great views in that evening and then went to Kailash Parbat for an okayish dinner and then back to Hostel for late night pool, foosball games and met around 8-9 new people who were also on solo trip, vibed along with all of them and was very happy to talk with them as I'm a bit extrovert too.


On Jan 2nd(had my birthday too), it was a relaxed day trip towards Dubare Elephant Park in morning  and later visited Mercara Gold Estate for a proper coffee + spice plantation tour and bought gifting coffee and chocolates too which were a bit costly. Ended the day just cafe hopping and some good simple birthday dinner. Ainmane Café was a highlight for Hot Coffee and BigCup Café for great pizza, garlic bread and cheesecake. I went back to hostel for picking up luggage and later boarded the night bus back to Bangalore.


Total spend came to exact ₹13,715, including all transport from home to home, hostel stay, local autos, jeep/cab rentals, food, and entry tickets and also includes ₹1500-2000 worth of gifting items like coffee and chocolates.

I texted her a couple of days ago asking if we could go for coffee or just generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s extended her trip so she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to have a conversation and offered to FaceTime.

Because I lost my arms saving my brother.

Every time I tried to kill myself, they cried and begged me.

""It's my fault. Don't die on us."" Brother said.

""You're my world."" Mom said.

""I'll do anything for your recovery."" Dad said.

I thought life would slowly get better, until I overheard their conversation.

""If only we'd known, it would've been better off if she'd died back then.""

Sorry Mom, sorry Dad, I wouldn't be a burden to you anymore.

But why?

Why did they cry as if they'd lost the whole world when I jumped off the building?

Chapter 1

The day my elder brother Lennon Powlet stormed out of the house in a fit of pique, I went looking for him in the pouring rain.

I never expected a fallen power line to hit me, leaving me without both arms forever.

In an instant, it shattered my dream of becoming a doctor and left me disabled—a constant patient, tied to the hospital for life.

I tried to kill myself countless times, but each time my family pulled me back from the brink of death.

Lennon begged me earnestly, ""It's my fault. I'm so sorry, Gracie.

""Please, don't die on us, okay?""

Mom quit her job to take care of me full-time. ""You're my world. If you die, what am I supposed to do?""

Dad worked insane overtime, even took a transfer overseas, all to earn more money for my rehab.

I thought life would slowly get better.

But just when I'd struggled my way into learning to live with my feet instead of my hands, I overheard their conversation by accident. ""If only we'd known, it would've been better off if she'd died back then.""

That evening, I made my way to the rooftop alone.

The wind was howling. I sniffled, but I didn't cry.

""Gracie! Don't move!""

Mom ran over and pulled me away from the edge of the roof with all her strength.

Her grip was so fierce that we both tumbled to the ground.

Before I could even get up, she slapped me hard across my face.

""Have you lost your mind? Are you trying to drive me to my grave?""

My ear rang. My cheek burned.

The next second, Mom pulled me into her arms and held me tight. ""If you dare jump off this roof, I'm jumping right after you!""

Her scalding tears dripped onto my neck.

Lennon stood beside us, gasping for air. He'd run so fast that he'd almost tripped and fallen.

When he saw that I was unharmed, his knees buckled, and he nearly dropped to the floor.

I buried my face in Mom's shoulder. ""I wasn't going to jump. Really.

""I just came up here to get some air. That's all.""

Mom froze for a second, then hugged me even tighter.

After a long while, Lennon turned around, his back looking hunched and defeated. ""Come on. Let's go home.""

Back in the house, I turned on the faucet and rinsed my feet as usual, then sat down at the dining table.

The food had been reheated so many times that it was already wilted and soggy.

I hung my head, picked up the spoon with my toes, and fed myself bite by bite.

Mom sat across from me, her eyes red and swollen.

Lennon poked at the food on his plate with his fork. He hadn't eaten a single mouthful.

""Gracie, my girlfriend and her parents are coming over tomorrow to talk about the engagement.""

I paused, then nodded. ""That's great. I've got plans with a friend tomorrow, so I won't be home for dinner.""

Lennon lowered his head and shoveled a big mouthful of food.

We all knew the truth.

Ever since I'd gotten hurt, I hadn't gone anywhere except the hospital. I'd cut off contact with everyone I used to know.

I didn't have any friends left.

That night, Mom ran my bath as usual.

I stood at the bathroom door, watching her bend down to test the temperature of the water.

""Mom.

""Can I grow my hair out?""

She slowly straightened up and turned to look at me. ""Why do you suddenly want long hair?""

I looked at my reflection in the mirror. ""Long hair can cover it up.

""So people won't notice that I don't have any hands.""

The towel in Mom's hand fell into the bathtub.

It took her a long moment to bend down, pick it up, and rinse it over and over under the faucet.

The sound of the running water drowned out her quiet, muffled sobs.

She kept her back to me, her voice thick with tears. ""Of course, you can, baby. My beautiful girl will look perfect with long hair.""

Early the next morning, the doorbell woke me.

It wasn't even eight yet. Mom opened the door, flustered. ""Coming!""

A bright, cheerful female voice rang out, ""Hello, Mrs. Powlet! Sorry, I'm ahead of schedule. I swapped shifts today and wanted to come help out.

""My parents will be here a bit later.""

I sat up and pushed my bedroom door open with my foot.

In the living room stood a young woman next to Lennon.

Her hair cascaded down her shoulders. She held elegant gift bags.

She was smiling warmly as she chatted with Mom.

Hearing the sound, she turned her head, and her gaze landed on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

I spun around, trying to scurry back to my room.

But Ashlee Raney walked toward me with a smile. ""You must be Gracie.

""Lenn talks about you often. It's so nice to finally meet you.""

She pulled a light gray scarf out of her paper bag and gently draped it over my shoulders. ""I spotted this scarf while I was on a business trip. It's cashmere, really soft.

""It suits your fair skin.""

The scarf carried a faint, pleasant scent.

I froze where I stood, my toes curling involuntarily.

""Thanks, Ashy.""

Lennon and Mom stood nearby, their expressions tense.

I hung my head, trying to step back. ""I'm sorry. I have plans with someone today. I won't be staying for dinner.""

Ashlee rested a hand lightly on my shoulder. ""I've come over several times and always missed you. Today, I'd like to spend some time with you.""

She smiled warmly, ""Right, Lenn?""

Lennon turned to me. ""Gracie, why don't you postpone your plans?""

I murmured a soft agreement.

By the time I finished washing up and sat down on the couch, Ashlee was already wearing Mom's apron, helping in the kitchen.

She moved efficiently, chatting with Mom as she worked, and Mom broke into a smile.

Ashlee set a fruit platter on the coffee table and sat down next to me. ""Gracie, you have such beautiful eyes. You should smile more often.""

I forced a faint smile, not knowing what to say.

Ashlee's parents arrived.

They were neatly dressed, their words measured and courteous.

The gifts they brought piled up on one corner of the coffee table.

When lunch was set on the table, I stood up. ""I'll go eat in my room. You guys...""

Ashlee pulled me back and shifted a chair closer to hers. ""Sit next to me.""

Mom opened her mouth, but no words came out. Lennon hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.

In the end, I sat down anyway.

At first, everyone chatted about the weather and the initial plans for the wedding.

Ashlee kept serving me food, acting as naturally as if we had known each other for years.

Then I picked up the soup spoon with my toes, smoothly and skillfully.

Then Ashlee's parents stopped smiling.

They put down their forks and exchanged a glance.

The room fell quiet except for Ashlee's voice, still chattering away.

After the meal, Ashlee's father, Gerald Raney, spoke up after taking a sip of coffee, ""Lenn is a good guy. We don't have any demands for the wedding. We only want you two to be happy.""

He paused, his gaze drifting slowly in my direction.

""But there is one condition. After you're married, your little family has to come first.

""Your sister has your parents to take care of her. You can't keep putting her needs before everything else.""

Lennon's back went rigid in an instant. ""Mr. Raney, Gracie is my sister. I will never abandon her.""

Gerald held up a hand to cut him off, ""But you're starting a family of your own now. You can't take care of her forever.""

""I can!""

""You can't! Not unless you don't want to marry my daughter.""

The air turned tense in an instant.

""He can,"" I chimed in.

Everyone turned to look at me.

I stared at my empty sleeves and repeated, ""Lenn can do it.""

Ashlee shot to her feet. ""Dad! What are you saying?

""I will never agree to this! Gracie is also my family from now on.""

Gerald's voice rose sharply. ""And what about you? What about your future? Always coming second to her?""

Gerald grabbed her wrist in a firm grip. ""Come with me. We're going home!""

Ashlee was dragged to the door by her parents.

She looked back, tears streaming down her face.

Lennon pulled out a pack of cigarettes and walked out to the balcony.

The lighter clicked several times before it finally lit.

I watched him through the glass door.

He hunched over, clouds of smoke curling upward before being scattered by the wind.

At that moment, I stared at my dangling sleeves, and a wave of nausea washed over me.

All of a sudden, I hated myself so much.

Chapter 3

In the middle of the night, I was woken up by noises from the living room.

I walked out barefoot.

Lennon was bending over to put on his shoes, moving in a hurry.

""Lenn, where are you going?""

He froze mid-movement. ""Ashy snuck out. She just called me. She's at the Glimmer Lake Park.

""I'm going to pick her up right now.""

I hesitated for a second, then nodded. ""It's cold outside. Put on more clothes.""

He stood up and glanced at me. ""Go back to bed.""

I gave him a small smile. ""I'll leave the door unlocked for you. Wait till you bring Ashy home.""

Lennon smiled too. He reached out and ruffled my hair. ""Okay.""

The door clicked shut softly.

The streetlights went out one by one. In no time, dawn broke.

Lennon didn't come home last night.

Mom was shocked when she got up and saw me curled up on the couch. ""Gracie? Why are you sleeping out here?""

""Lenn went to get Ashy. He hasn't come back yet.""

Mom dialed his number. It rang for ages before it was picked up.

Her face drained of color as she listened. ""Which hospital? We'll be right there!""

Mom turned to look at me, her lips trembling. ""Ashy ... got hit by a car.""

Ashlee was being resuscitated. The lights outside the emergency room were glaringly white.

When we arrived, we saw Lennon leaning against the wall from a distance.

His clothes were covered in dust. There was a bruise on his forehead.

Gerald, who had been so polite and refined just yesterday, was clutching Lennon's collar tightly, his eyes bloodshot.

""It's all your fault! It's all because of you, you bastard!

""If it weren't for you, my daughter wouldn't have snuck out and gotten into that accident!""

Mom stumbled over to them, bowing repeatedly. ""I'm so sorry. Truly sorry.""

Her voice shook, and tears streamed down her face. ""It's our fault. We didn't raise our son right.""

Gerald shoved Lennon away and pointed a finger at Mom. ""Get out!

""Get lost with your son and this cripple! Never show your faces in front of us again!

""If anything happens to Ashy, you'll pay for this!""

We stood there for a long time until the door to the emergency room swung open.

A doctor stepped out, removing his mask. ""The patient is out of danger for now, but she still needs to be monitored.""

Ashlee's parents surrounded him at once.

Lennon took half a step forward, then froze.

Mom grabbed his arm. ""Let's go. We'll head home now.""

The ride back home was completely silent.

Lennon gripped the steering wheel so tight his knuckles turned white.

I sat in the back seat, staring at the back of Lennon's head.

For a split second, I saw him quickly raise a hand and wipe his eyes.

When we got home, I went back to my room.

I didn't know how long had passed before I heard muffled sobs through the door. ""Mom, it's my fault. I'm the one who hurt Ashy.

""If something really happens to her...

""Why didn't I agree yesterday! Why didn't I agree!""

His cries grew increasingly louder.

Then I heard his hoarse voice say, ""If I'd known this would happen, I never should've stopped her from killing herself back then.""

A sharp slap rang out.

Then came Mom's broken, hysterical sobbing.

I leaned against the door and slowly slid down to the floor.

Tears welled up silently, streaming down my cheeks, down my neck, and soaking into my collar.

Chapter 4

The next afternoon, my phone rang.

I took a few deep breaths and swiped to answer with my toes.

Dad's face appeared on the screen.

The background was a shabby work shed, the sky grey and overcast.

He had lost a lot of weight and gotten much darker.

""Gracie, have you eaten?

""How have you been lately? Do your arms still hurt?""

I forced a smile and kept my voice as cheerful as I could. ""Yeah, I have. I'm doing great.

""Dad, you've lost weight and gotten tanned.""

He waved a hand dismissively. ""I'm fine. I'm tough.

""The project here is wrapping up. Once I get paid, I'll head back and find you the best physical therapist money can buy.""

Just then, someone off-screen balled him by his name, urging him to get back to work.

""Dad, get to work. I'm really okay, I promise.

""Take care of yourself out there. Don't get sick. Eat well and stay warm..."" I rambled on.

Dad smiled, ""Alright then, I have to get to work. Be good for your mom at home.""

I set the phone down and brushed my cheek with my knee, which felt damp.

The house was eerily quiet.

Mom and Lennon had gone to the hospital early in the morning.

On the dining table in the living room, a plate of food was covered and left for me.

I sat down and ate slowly, one bite at a time.

I finished everything on the plate.

Then I went back to my room and opened the wardrobe with my foot.

Tucked away at the very back was a light blue dress with delicate embroidery on the chest.

It was a gift from Lennon, bought with his first paycheck.

He said, ""You'll look like a princess in this.""

That felt like a lifetime ago.

It took me much longer than usual to put it on, fumbling awkwardly with my feet and teeth.

The zipper was at the back. I couldn't reach it, so I left it undone.

I sat down in front of the mirror and stared at my reflection.

The dress hung loosely on my frame with the zipper open, the sleeves dangling empty at my sides.

I suddenly wanted to hear Mom's voice.

I picked up my phone and dialed Mom's number with my foot.

It rang for a long time, but no one answered.

I tried again, with the same result.

I called Lennon next.

This time, the call was cut off almost immediately.

A few seconds later, I received a message from him with only three words: ""I'm very busy.""

I stared at those three words for a long time.

Then I typed a reply, ""I'm sorry.""

I slipped on my softest cloth shoes and left the house.

At the far end of the neighborhood stood a remote apartment building.

I didn't take the elevator. I used the stairs instead.

This building was next to the perimeter wall. Below was a usually deserted greenbelt with some half-dead shrubs.

There were 18 floors. I made my way to the rooftop.

The wind on the rooftop was strong as usual.

I walked to the edge, sat down, and dangled my legs over the side.

This way, I wouldn't hit anyone when I fell.

I pulled a painkiller out of the dress pocket, tore open the foil with my teeth, and swallowed it dry.

I was scared of pain. And I was worried that if the fall didn't kill me, that would be too humiliating.

Then, I leaned forward gently.

Falling through the air, the wind roared up in a deafening rush.

\*\*\*

Mom and Lennon got home in the evening.

As soon as their car turned into the neighborhood, they saw a large crowd gathered in the distance.

A sinking feeling of dread washed over both of them.

Mom pushed the car door open, her legs giving way, nearly collapsing.

Lennon steadied her, and the two stumbled toward the crowd as fast as they could.

They forced their way through to the front.

In a cleared patch of ground lay a figure, covered by a dirty plastic sheet.

Peeking out from under the edge was a sliver of light blue fabric and a few strands of black hair.

Mom went hysterical, shoving everyone aside and lifting the plastic sheet off.​",6,1767529492.0,Novelnews,6,1.0,False

1q3onik,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q3onik/is_this_normal_boyfriend_behavior_39f_41m/,Is this normal boyfriend behavior? 39F & 41M,"Is my (39f) bf (41m) everything I’ve ever missed out on or someone who is just love bombing me? We have been together for 5 months.

My bf is still legally married to the only long term relationship he’s ever had, his wife of 15+ years who he has a few kids with. I have been mostly single for the last 6 years with the exception of a couple short relationships and a lot of dating jerks. His being married was a big issue for me when we met and that hasn’t changed. He continues to tell me it will get taken care of, he doesn’t love her, and so on. I was extremely hesitant to even entertain a relationship because of this and now I wish I stuck to that. 

At first we went on dates and he was very thoughtful about planning things to do together. He has slowly moved his clothes and other things into my house and expects to spend 24/7 with me if we aren’t working. He gets pretty upset (emotional, hurt) if I do not want to spend every available moment with him and always says that he loves me more than I love him. 

He is more emotional than I am in general, and he’s very anxious. I am generally a loud person and when I get upset about something he takes that as I am attacking him, (because that’s what his wife always did/does allegedly). He is outwardly supportive and calls me beautiful, gorgeous, sexy, etc., but sometimes I feel like he’s willing to go along with whatever I want because he’s attracted to me and not because that’s also what he wants. I say that because he will bring things up to hold over me later.

When we are having a disagreement and I need space, he refuses to leave. He says that is just running away from the problem. I used to appreciate his willingness to talk through things, but it’s starting to feel more hostage-y at this point. 

He does a lot of things for me which I am usually uncomfortable with but I eventually tried to let it go since he claimed to enjoy helping me. Things like move furniture, open all the doors for me, go shopping together, makes me coffee, etc. I cook and clean and do his laundry at my house and things like that for him as well. I thought we did things for each other because we were in a relationship and that’s what you do but I found out during an argument that he does things for me so I will like him?

Since he would not give me alone time when I said that’s what I needed, I got quiet and retreated into my phone for a distraction before bed. Maybe that was the wrong thing to do but I really didn’t know what else to do, I just wanted to be alone with my thoughts. Well we both woke up in the middle of the night and he said me ignoring him was not how you treat someone you love and that he’s sorry he wasn’t good enough for me. He packed some of his things and left, upset again and saying that he can tell I’ve “switched it off” for him. 

I am so used to toxicity and I don’t want to sabotage something that could be great. I just need some outside perspective. Are my expectations of a normal adult relationship really far off or is this not normal behavior for middle aged people?

Tl;dr boyfriend is possessive and wants to be together 24/7 because he loves me so much.

1q3on95,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1q3on95/mirenaa_plethora_of_problems/,Mirena--A Plethora of Problems,"I have had a Mirena for about 6 years...it has been 6 years of random, hellish circumstances. Let's say there should be a lot more awareness of the side effects of IUDs like Mirena. It started out great, my periods were gone, and my endometriosis pain was 100% gone. I loved it! Then, I started having some health issues. Heart palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, vision changes, mood swings, concentration issues, trouble reading (I was in my master's program at the time), breathlessness with the slightest excursion, hip pain, water retention, and weight gain. I was barely 30 years old! I tried diets. I wore a heart monitor for a few weeks and did an ECG. Then they said it might be in my brain, but neurology said I didn't fit the criteria for a consult. So, my doctor sent me to a Mental Health facility where I did a short quiz, maybe 10 questions, and my doctor said, ""You don't have ADHD, you have bipolar disorder"". She didn't say which bipolar, but I was in shock because I came to see her for concentration issues, the mood swings weren't horrible and I didn't experience any hallucinations. 

  
I believed her, and got on Lamotrigine for my mood swings. It did even me out, but over the years I felt off, like I wasn't myself. Fast-forward to about a year ago I started developing memory problems. Very severe, short-term memory problems. They didn't know what was wrong with me and I said, I never had memory problems before so it must be my medication. I had been on so much and experienced a multitude of side effects to the point that over half my medications were just to treat the side effects like involuntary muscle movements. I started reducing my medication until on Jan 1, 2025 I was completely medication-free. Or so I thought. My acne had come back on my face and back, but everything else was significantly improved.

  
I had forgotten that I was a fertile female and should be having periods as well if it weren't for the IUD I had forgotten about. So one day I was in the doctor's office and she went over my medication list, and she mentioned the IUD. I said, Oh yeah, I still have that! We both laughed, but it got me thinking. While my memory wasn't perfect anymore, I was much better off the medication, but I was still extremely bloated. I often have people ask me when my baby is due, and sometimes I play a little game if it's a stranger, saying, ""when do you guess?"" They usually say I'm about 7 or 8 months pregnant. I went to see an herbalist for my memory problems a long time ago and she said it was likely from my gut and told me I was extremely bloated. My belly size does not match the rest of my body, and I constantly have that pain, water retention, etc.

  
That night I did a google search and was shocked to find out EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM could be related to getting the IUD. I just hope there isn't permanent damage, especially with my brain.

Mirena IUDs can cause depression, anxiety, mood swings, vision changes, bloating, IBS, water retention, heart palpitations, memory issues, concentration issues, acne, sleep disturbances, and so much more. It pretty much sums it up for me.

  
I also did some research about the mold in coffee, so I recently switched to organic, third-party tested mold-free coffee beans I grind fresh every day. It tastes way better, smells amazing, and my stomach doesn't quite hurt as bad but the bloating is still there...I still look pregnant on birth control.

  
All those hoops I had to jump through. Relationships were ruined because of my mood swings. My grades in school started to decline because I couldn't concentrate long enough to read one paragraph of one research paper and remember it. I learned to take notes of everything and then would forget the notes. I drove to the wrong house frequently over 1 year after I moved. 

  
My regular doctor tried to remove my Mirena a few weeks ago but something happened with the string. It was excruciating as she was trying to grasp the string and remove it, which caused me to bleed, and then she said, ""I am so sorry, I can't get it. You will need to see a specialist and they may need to do an operation to remove it if it doesn't cooperate with them."" My OB/GYN from my pregnancy 9 years ago was booked solid for 4 months so I'm going to see a new doctor in a few weeks, which is almost 2 months after I realized this could be the source of EVERYTHING. All the heartache, all the struggles, and thinking something was wrong with me. 6 years of doctors shuffling me around to try to figure out what was wrong with me. My eyes got bad, then better, then bad again and my eye doctor couldn't figure out the strength I needed because my eyes were so dry even with eye drops she thought maybe that was making my vision inconsistent. A lens that was a good strength ended up being worse after a couple of seconds. I stopped wearing my contacts and decided to just let my body return to normal before getting checked again. 

I will post again after I get my IUD removed. I tried to find updates on before and after pictures of bloating from IUD synthetic hormones but didn't see any. My waist is currently 48-50 inches, and while there is some fat, most of it, I believe, is bloating. My stomach is soft for about 1 or 2 inches and then it's hard. I have hardly any fat on my arms, some on my thighs...and I have tried to lose weight, I've cut dairy and gluten, I have done so many things. I think this is the last resort, the last thing I can think of that could be causing my symptoms.",1,1767529323.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

1q3ohn7,https://v.redd.it/2f89w24kqbbg1,Logo Design For TYPE® Coffee,"PROCESS BREAKDOWN — HOW I CREATED THIS SCENE 👇

Step 01
I started in Illustrator, designing the logo and finalizing its form so it could work across static and motion use.

Step 02
Next, I went to Pinterest and searched for a minimal coffee paper cup in hand to find the right composition and visual reference.

Step 03
I took that reference into Nano Banana and used a prompt to translate the scene into my own brand style.

Step 04
Once the image was ready, I used Freepik’s Upscale tool to enhance the quality and clean up the details.

Step 05
After upscaling, I opened the image in Photoshop to add my logo, apply brand colors, and refine the composition.

Step 06
Then I went back to Freepik’s Video Generator and used LTX 2 to turn the static visual into a high-quality vertical video.

Step 07
I animated the logo separately using Lottie, keeping the motion minimal and intentional.

Step 08
Finally, I brought everything together using a Jitter template to compile the full scene and finalize the motion.

This is how I’m combining AI tools and traditional design workflows to create branded visuals faster  without losing creative control.

M 37
Working in consulting
Pay 140k£ base plus 20% bonus 

Current net worth
Cash - 48k£
LISA - 21k£
S&S ISA- 120k£ ( use both my and partners ISA)
Pension - 92k£
Other investments (home country) - 25k£

Hold more cash as I want to give down payment for a house in 2026 (search ongoing)

Aim to keep pension contribution per year to 60k£ via salary sacrifice. For example - will salary sacrifice 40k to bring base pay to 96k. Company gives 7% so in essence without taking into account bonus I willl be putting 50k£ into pension or roughly 4k£ per month

In April, I swap 4k from cash to LISA to get an instant 1k from govt and reduce interest on cash

ISA- plan to invest 2-2.5k£ per month. Main investments as S&P500, a sustainable ETF,some gold and then in few companies that I research well. Typically I try to max out my ISA by Q4 and then invest as much as I can in partners ISA. 

Have modelled variables in an excel model and the main thing for 2026 is to really control the small items (e.g., coffee) that become big expenses when rolled up

Now with the house purchase net worth will take a massive hit with the mortgage. Thinking of buying 400-420ish with a 70k£ down payment.

More of a rant post but in case any one has ideas to help make the money work more for me.",0,1767528762.0,FIREUK,0,0.5,False
1q3oh2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1q3oh2e/the_rejection_that_changed_how_i_view_confidence/,"The rejection that changed how I view confidence, women, and myself forever","I still remember her exact words.

""You know what's actually attractive? A guy who approaches because he has something genuine to say, not because I'm just another girl he's trying to impress.""

It was my seventeenth cold approach of the week. I had been reading all the pickup material, watching confidence videos, and forcing myself to talk to women in coffee shops, bookstores, and on the street. I thought I was working on self-improvement. In reality, I was treating connections like conquests and women like checkboxes.

This particular approach was at a bookstore. She was browsing the psychology section I wasn't. But I walked up with my rehearsed opener about book recommendations anyway. Her response stopped me cold.

She wasn't cruel about it. She was matter-of-fact, looking directly at me with a slight smile that held no animosity but offered no encouragement either. There was something in her calm delivery that cut through all my prepared lines and techniques.

""I can tell you're nervous,"" she continued when I said nothing. ""And that's actually fine. Nervousness is honest. But the rehearsed confidence isn't working for either of us.""

I should have been mortified. Instead, I felt strangely relieved like someone had finally called out the elephant in the room. My whole approach to meeting women had been built on a fundamental misunderstanding of both confidence and connection.

""Can I ask you something?"" I said, abandoning my script entirely. ""What would have been a better way to start a conversation with you?""

What followed was a twenty-minute talk that changed my entire perspective. She explained that she could always tell the difference between someone approaching with genuine interest versus someone approaching because she fit certain criteria. The former felt like a compliment the latter felt like being reduced to an opportunity.

""If you had noticed what book I was looking at and had an actual thought about it, that would have been real,"" she said. ""Or if you had just admitted you wanted to meet me because something specific caught your attention. Authenticity is magnetic. The techniques you're using are transparent.""

She wasn't telling me not to approach women she was highlighting the difference between connection and collection. Between seeing someone as a person versus seeing them as a challenge.

The next day, I threw out the pickup material and made a new commitment: I would only approach when I had something genuine to say or ask, not just because someone was attractive. I would allow myself to be nervous rather than hiding behind false bravado. And I would measure success by the quality of interactions, not by getting phone numbers.

The results were immediate and profound. I had fewer interactions, but infinitely better ones. I remember approaching a woman at a farmers market because I was genuinely curious about the unusual fruit she was buying. No agenda, just curiosity. We ended up walking around the market together for an hour, and yes, exchanged numbers naturally at the end.

Another time, I complimented a woman on her band t-shirt because I actually loved that band. The conversation flowed into music, then concerts, then our shared experience growing up in the Midwest. There was no technique in sight just authentic connection.

The most important shifthowever, wasn't in how women responded to me. It was in how I felt about myself. The constant anxiety about ""performing"" correctly had been exhausting. Being genuine, even when nervous, felt freeing. I no longer walked away from interactions feeling like I had succeeded or failed I walked away havinsimply experienced a human connection, whatever form it took.

That bookstore woman probably doesn't remember our conversation. She likely has no idea that her straightforward feedback fundamentally changed my approach to not just dating, but all social interactions. But her willingness to be honest rather than just dismissive gave me the wake-up call I needed.

The great irony of cold approaching is that the moment you stop seeing it as a technique to master and start seeing it as humans connecting with humans, that's when the real magic happens. Not in how many numbers you collect, but in how many moments of genuine connection you create even if they last just five minutes in a bookstore with someone you'll never see again.",4,1767528762.0,LockedInMan,2,0.84,False
