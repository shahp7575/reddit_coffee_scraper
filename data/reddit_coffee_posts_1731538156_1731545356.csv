Best neighborhood for a someone in their late 20s (single) that wants to meet other young professionals?

My main priority is affordability (1br <$1.7k), walkability to coffee shop/grocery store/gym, and young professionals (22-35). People say uptown but when I visit it seems empty and dirty. I’ve been told the Colony, which has a party reputation that I probably don’t want.

I liked Bishops Arts for the coffee shops and art galleries. I went to Oak Cliff Coffee then walked down from there, it was great but It’s far from where I work (Addison) and the crime is high. I’m visiting the Village, Lower Greenville, and the Design district this weekend. Hoping to hear some of your perspectives. ",1,1731545177.0,askdfw,0,1.0,False

1gqsh1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1gqsh1s/triggered_by_a_random_memory_from_the_past_just/,Triggered by a random memory from the past - just ranting,"I'm watching my friend's dog while she's away for a few weeks. This dog is incredibly spoiled and has a huge ego, I've completely fallen in love with this dog (becuase obviously, right? Ugh). 

Anyways, this dog is on a special diet, its like 4 raw meats in a fancy bowl with specific amounts of seeds and stuff sprinkled on top, theres a dried fish or a turkey neck or quail egg for garnish and stuff - its a whole thing to serve this dog dinner and honestly I'm enjoying it, I love cooking and its such a joy to be making dinner for this dog every night. 

Tonight as I was making his dinner I had some kind of messed up PTSD flashback and it totally threw me off. 

I was stuck in this miserable loop in my marriage when I was still stupid, before I woke up to reality. It was probably the ten thousandth time that I had spent 2 hours after work making some elaborate dinner for my ex, something he liked that I couldn't even eat a crumb of because I have crazy food sensitivites. He would come home, ignore my fucking existence, ignore the delicious smell of dinner and just crash on the couch or his PC. From his fucking desk job at work where he literally consults people for tech support. It wasn't even hard labour or anything but his performance would have made you think he was doing some insane phsyically exhausing labour like chopping wood or drilling oil the way he put on a show when he got home. 

And when I would stupidly make a plate for him with ganish and everything, and take it to him, he wouldn't even move his body to reach for it, I'd just have to put the plate in front of him on the coffee table or his desk and he would continue to play his video games or scroll his phone for as long as he wanted until the food got cold, and then eat half and then he would quietly throw the rest in the trash. 

Forget gratitude, I would have fucking died for simple acknowledgement during those days. 

So back to this dog, he comes and stands next to me in the kitchen the whole time I'm putting his dinner together. He's got the biggest eyes in anticipation, he's drooling and being so patient. I put his dish down and he barks a little bark of gratitude and excitement. Devours the whole thing like a tornado. Looks so satisfied, and wants to cuddle afterwards. 

I'll probably bring this up in therapy next week but holy shit. This dog is literally healing my divorce ptsd.

1gqsfvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gqsfvd/one_week_caffeine_free_after_quitting_for_the/,One week caffeine free after quitting for the second time,"I was off habitual caffeine use for over a year starting in July 2023, with some experimentation here or there and a brief relapse during a vacation. But in August of this year, I chose to start using caffeine more regularly again to see if it would help motivate me a little more. It might have in certain ways, but recently it became clear that coffee was only spiking my stress (and my blood pressure). It seems like my sleep has been more erratic. I unintentionally had stronger coffee than I'm used to when staying out of town with a friend a few weeks ago, and it made me realize just how much coffee is impacting me already. I thought my tolerance would increase quickly, but even after two months of daily caffeine use - one, maybe two cups of coffee per day - I am still *far* more sensitive to caffeine than I was before quitting in 2023.

So I briefly tapered with tea, and now I've been off for a week. I had some very mild headache symptoms during parts of the taper, but so far I've been okay. Quitting this time has been *much* easier. Maybe I'm a little sluggish at times, but I already feel similar to the ""normal"" that I felt off of caffeine. Nothing at all like the initial come-down last year. My blood pressure and stress levels are much better already, and my sleep is definitely improving. This shouldn't be too surprising, as two to three months of use after a year-long reset probably didn't have anywhere near the systemic effect that decades of habitual use had. 

I am shocked that people use this stuff regularly in such vast quantities. One cup of coffee would wreck my day, and a particularly strong cup would keep me stressed well into the night. I would never have thought of myself as being particularly sensitive to caffeine before, but trying to go back on the drug makes it abundantly clear just how strong it is.

I don't know if I'm swearing off an occasional cup of tea, but my days of habitual caffeine usage are over.",2,1731544977.0,decaf,1,1.0,False
1gqsfq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1gqsfq9/rant_time_the_beige_beeyatch_mil/,RANT TIME: The Beige Bee-yatch (MIL),"Trigger/Content Warnings: Mental, emotional, and physical abuse. Christian nationalist right-wing ideology. Narc abuse, abuse by former LEO.

Currently live with MIL and husband, and stepson in the same residence.  
First met MIL in 2002. At the first meeting between her and my parents at a local coffee shop, instead of talking to my parents, she pored over beige paint chip swatches for 90 minutes. “Should I choose Oatmeal, or Garlic…?” My father also calls her “Beige” as a nickname, because she’s absolutely obsessed with the nuances in shades of beige for the walls.

My husband has been severely physically disabled for about 15 years, and had developmental disabilities (autism) as a child. He can no longer work. I had trouble finding decent employment until 2021. In addition, I also have a narc mom/enabler dad (autism spectrum as well), and have suffered from workplace bullying, physical assault from community members at my job who were criminals or had severe mental illness (former educator), church bullying which impacted my mental health, preventing me from being stable enough to move out and on sooner.  
  
In 2023, I purchased a home, so we could finally move out and give my husband some peace in his latter years. The illnesses he has are chronic and slowly fatal.  
  
Story for another day: I hired a contractor to do work on my house, paid a down payment of thousands. The work didn’t get done on the agreed-upon timeline. Contractor was a former LEO and Republican Christian Nationalist type.   
  
Long story short, I was polite, but firmly let him know that if he couldn’t give me an updated statement, and could not complete the work after 5 weeks when he said he’d have the smallish repairs done in 2 weeks - that I needed to move on. He pulled the back off my home with nautical rope and a large truck. The home is half demo-ed and now unliveable.  
  
During that time, MIL swore that she had been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and has refused treatment. We are back in my husband’s origin home again. I also have to consider my toddler stepson’s well-being in this. (MIL is nice to him, at least. It’s extremely fake, but at least he’s not being harmed.)

The Beige Bee-yatch continuously slams doors to bedrooms, entry/exit doors, and to appliances. I would say we’ve had to replace the doorknobs 5x over the past 5 years. My husband’s condition causes him to jump and have heart palpitations when he hears loud noises, so this is a form of mental, emotional and physical abuse. I’ve had to replace appliances that she’s destroyed. I think we’re on microwave 3 in 3 years, as well. I’ve commented on her stopping this behavior and those pleas are ignored completely.

My husband is adopted. Both my MIL, whom I suspect is a covert narcissist due to the following guidance from verywellmind:

* ""I'm too good for this. I shouldn't have to tolerate these people.""
* ""I deserve all of the good things life has to offer.""
* ""Other people have it better than me and it isn't fair. I deserve more because I am better than other people.""
* ""People never appreciate how special I am.""
* ""I can't believe you did that. Don't do that again. You should feel ashamed.""
* ""Remember when I helped you a few years ago? You owe me a favor.""
* ""I'm the best you'll ever have. You'll never find anyone else like me.""
* ""No one else would give you the time of day. You should be grateful I stick around.""
* ""I was just joking. I can't believe you took that seriously.""

These are nearly verbatim out of her book. Nothing my husband does - including taking his ailing disabled body to try to fix plumbing and electrical issues - has ever been good enough. She has consistently denigrated his self-esteem to the point that he thinks he has no value as a person. With the extreme chronic pain he’s in, plus the constant abuse that he’s suffered over the past 42 years, he has hourly thoughts of unaliving.

His adoptive father was an alcoholic and overt narcissist, who was a gun happy equal opportunity hater of nearly everyone. Perverse jokes, fat jokes, misogynist jokes, racist jokes, plus 5 packs of cheap cigarettes, and a case of Natty Light a day. From age 5 to 15, my husband - always slight of build due to his genetic illness - was beaten severely. Beige Bee-yatch did NOTHING to stop this. Both of them turned a small, awkward child with autism into a scapegoat for - everything - including a good number of things he never even did. Including things that they did and didn’t want to take accountability for.  I remember coming to the house and getting blamed by both of them for things I didn’t do - and he didn’t do, in our early dating days.

The old man was impossible to live with. We didn’t start living in this home until 2013, when he passed from a late-onset muscular dystrophy disorder. At that point, we lived in the hood and had just been robbed. She invited us to come live with her. I somehow thought maybe without the old man verbally berating her, she might turn out to be kind again. I had this vision that this woman was a victim of her husband’s abuse, and maybe underneath she was all right. How wrong could I have been? I’ll never forget my husband racing home from a job that would employ him with his cane (at the time), a new job that promised to pay $80K a year (which was like a holy grail to me) in the Midwest - that his father was dying. Since he was still in training, they wouldn’t let him have the time off - lost that job. 

My husband drove straight through from the Midwest to the Southeast, which took him nearly 20 hours  in one go. He was so dizzy and exhausted (remember he has a chronic illness as well) that he stopped at the rest stop near home to go relieve himself, fell and split his forehead open. She groaned and was more worried about the cosmetic appearance of the skin flap going back right: “this is why you can’t KEEP A JOB, that thing on your HEAD.” (His appearance and personal hygiene is one thing she never stopped harping on. My husband recounts during his battle with acne as a teen that she took steel wool and scrubbed his face, saying he had anchovy pizza face. Ironically, one of the things I liked about him most was how good he smelled, that his feet rarely ever sweat or stink, and that he just wasn’t “gross” like most of the men I’d ever met. I can tell you other tales of her delusions in a moment.)

When we went to the hospital to see his adoptive father dying from COPD (5 packs a day will do that) and dystrophy, my husband fell again, flat on his face because she was walking too fast for a man with a cane who‘d just suffered a concussion and small brain bleed. She heard him hit the floor. Cruelly, she kept on walking while I helped him up. Again, I thought maybe she was upset that he was away while his father was in crisis - but at the same time, I knew this could be a portent. Please know that both of us have autism and are highly ‘gifted‘ (?), are old-school gamers. When both of your parent sets have at least one narc that has it out for the other partner you’re with, and you live in a backwoods Bible Belt area, and you are \*different\* - we didn’t have people to go to for support or help. An offer to get out of a dangerous situation in our old residence where 3 men in masks with guns and crowbars who had come by 3x to rob us - you think of immediate safety.

The Beige Bee-yatch has unequivocally told us that since we aren’t Republican, that WE are the problem with the country.   
  
Here’s a select short list of insults from her to me:  
  
\*You’re not really an Indian. (I am Indigenous and grew up with cultural ways from my family)  
\*Your babies are better off dead. (I miscarried and was trying not to tell her, but she was calling the police on me because she thought my UNLIT, UNUSED Yankee Candles were going to burn the house down.)  
\*She’s going to break my floor! (I have weight issues due to hypothyroidism, PCOS and genetics. I’ve not broken her floor yet after a decade.)  
\*She threatened to kill me! (I did run down the hall because I was upset at her long berating of me, during which she told me to shut up - but I didn’t physically threaten her in any way. I did not touch her or even get within a few feet of her.) 

The Beige Bee-yatch pushed me backwards, slammed my husband’s arm in the den door, called police because we were going to cause arson in her mind with unlit candles I happened to have, kicked my husband in the testicles with her knee because she didn’t want him getting some peanut butter for a sandwich, repeatedly pushed or bumped into my family members in a not-so- ‘accidental‘ aggressive way. The door slamming is constant, despite my husband clutching his chest and saying his heart hurts. His blood pressure drops and he starts to faint. I don’t know what to do or where to go - the half-demoed house still has a mortgage.  
  
She’s thrown away my spiritual items, accused me of breaking her car seat when I didn’t even sit in it, accused others of stealing her checkbook when she misplaced it. She’s berated us I don’t know how many times in a very safe neighborhood with police families because there are “gypsies and troubadours, and transients” outside. Yep, roving bards from the 12th muhfuggen century are plotting against this woman, according to her. And we’re not securing the house well enough against medieval marauders.

My husband and I are just \*beneath her\* even though we’ve bought her appliances, fixed all her house concerns whenever possible (that’s a 90/10 ratio I would estimate), kept her whole lawn mowed, kept her garden nice, take out her trash and recycling, pay the service people (AC maintenance, plumbing, exterminator, electrician, arborist, gutter maintenance, septic maintenance, well maintenance, water treatment, etc.) We pay for her cell phone bill.

I sit here in my chair working overtime, watching my streaming services, playing games, looking after my husband and stepson. When I’m not fixing something or cooking something, I’m in bed if I’m not working. I’m trying my best to give my family the best life I can.

He’s so smart and we share many interests. I like him. At work he is professional and keeps his distance. When we are together, he is friendly and outgoing towards me. He said he’d like to go out again soon. 

But I wonder if he even likes me because he’s made no move to touch me physically. Usually men want to touch women they like, even in a small way. So this is odd to me. After our last date, we sat in his car for a little while before he dropped me off. I would’ve let him kiss me and I could tell he thought about it because he looked at my mouth. Like, come on, dude. 

I know he lacks confidence because he told me he dislikes his physical appearance, so that could be a factor. 

He’s also probably trying to be respectful, etc. I’m wondering if I should wait and let him go for it, or encourage him somehow/do it myself. ",0,1731544262.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

1gqs5v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FromSeries/comments/1gqs5v6/just_a_hunch_but/,Just a hunch… but,"Are they in “The Twilight Zone”? Like literally? 

I was about to go to sleep last night and saw the old original Twilight Zone streaming and started on episode one… and boy is it oddly similar.

The show’s intro shows a plain of nothingness with 3 rocks or statues or structures that reminded me of the 3 rocks Tabitha saw when she was young.

Then there is a spooky cave entrance. Which looks like the cave entrance in Fromville… 

And then the first episode a man is walking along the road and doesn’t remember much, like he has amnesia, he figures and he enters a town that has a diner, motel, post office, etc, but everyone is gone.

He enters the diner and the jukebox on the table is on and playing a song, and there is a tea kettle boiling with hot water and he pours himself some tea or (coffee). 

He goes to the back of the diner and it looks oddly like the diner in Fromville… 

Then he wanders about and sees mannequins and moving vans and just random things - looking for anybody, any human interaction… and then as the show ends where he is having a nervous break down… and the odd experience pretty much “broke” him… 

Cut to, military testing him in an isolation box on day like ~484 hours because he is supposed to go to the moon (or somewhere in outer space) and it would take him around 20 days to get there. 

They did say the answers were in the beginning and this was the first episode on that show and the whole first episode kind of hinges on a journey, a family, into a road, and then a town, isolation, and the rest is just oddly similar… 

Or maybe that’s the skeleton of the concept they picked and they built another story from TZ S1 E1.

One obgyn said I had GD but my primary and delivering DR said I didn't. A1C went down from 6.0 (prepregnacy) to 5.3 during pregnancy and fasting was never above 99. I was never on insulin. The moment I had the baby, fasting has been in the hundreds and A1C spiked to 5.8. I am not going over 120 carbs (usually betten 100-110), eating 80-90g of protien, cooking everything at home; mostly stews and salads, no coffee or anything, just water (and like a. 5-1 gallon) and steamed veggies, fresh low glycemic fruit. Absolutely following the dietitian plan and no idea why it's so high. I haven't eaten junk food in years, didn't get to eat ice cream or cake during pregnancy and haven't really indulged in anything (except a gluten-free berry cake at my baby shower) and occasional Bobos muffin (once every 2 weeks). 

Primary is wanting to wait until 6 months postpartum but is leaning towards prescribing metformin if my numbers don't go down. I haven't had soda in YEARS. I've never struggled this hard before. It is frustrating and I hate intermittent fasting so much. I'm grumpy and annoyed and my boyfriend said I'm like the snickers hangrey commercials eating my (protien packed) salads with a death stare. Also I've managed to gain weight since leaving the hospital. I'm eating green chile elk stew right now and this sucks so much. The food tastes good- I'm not saying that- just want something hardy and to not be so restricted. My numbers have always went down when I've been this strict.

We chatted a bit at lunch and on the way to training and even when her friends were there, she would talk almost exclusively to me, we teased each other a bit back and forth (nothing risky, mainly calling each other nerdy in creative ways). She also kept laughing at most things I said, even if they weren't really intended as jokes. When I complimented an accessory she was wearing, she replied with ""aww, thanks love"". I thought things were going well and was planning on asking her if she wanted to go for coffee this week.

Now, due to bad luck, I didn't get to speak to her for a couple days until today and for some reason, it all feels different all of a sudden. We talked and she barely seemed interested in what I was saying or answering my questions and at training, it even seemed like she was trying to avoid me. We started warming up together but after a few minutes, she just wandered off to keep warming up with someone else. I honestly don't know whether I did something to make her uncomfortable, but I haven't even made any kind of move yet.

I don't know whether I should just consider today an off day and see whether things go back to normal, go for some kind of hail Mary confession (probably a terrible idea), or back off and try to get over her.

Put something on to listen to and make a coffee, then get to work putting the bulbs in pots. Excitedly place my pots, proud of my handy work. Get a bit sad that it’s over because I find planting bulb pots an **incredibly enjoyable** mindless task. Spend all winter thinking about my pots and consuming all sorts of bulb related content on social media, like bulb lasagnas and such. Bask in the glory of my flowers in spring, invigorated by their beauty. Pledge to buy even more bulbs for an even bigger display next year. Rinse. Repeat. It started out with a little bag of minnow daffs from Poundland back in the beginning of my gardening journey. But once I saw those sweet little flowers in spring, my heart melted and I knew it was game over for my self control. I needed more. This year I planted almost 300 bulbs. I planted most in one go, and while I was tired at the end I didn’t want to stop. Over 30 pots. I actually ran out of terracotta pots, bagged compost (those big 100l bags), my own homemade compost, and plant tags before I had all my bulbs planted. I didn’t even stop to consider if I would be able to navigate my postage stamp garden when all these pots are placed- if I can even find places for them. With the last of my bulbs though, I scraped the very bottom of the barrel of my own compost pile and chucked them in old nursery pots to give out for free to anyone who walked past my house. I was sad that I was officially done- or so I thought. One evening, while sipping tea, I get an email from Farmer Gracy. The big red letters jumped off my screen “**SPRING BULB SALE**”. I had no choice, I still had a £5 off voucher that expired soon anyways. I told myself I’d figure it out later.  I grabbed two more daff varieties and more muscari. At long last I was able to plant them yesterday. And I’m pleased to say I did indeed figure it out. I’ll have to strategically hide the nursery pots they’re in behind some other pots, but they’re planted!  The issue is; listening to my creepy pastas, and enjoying a cup of coffee, and cramming more bulbs into more pots has breathed more life into this obsession. I had a ball. Objectively I know I have to be for real this time and resist any more purchases…. But I had so much fun yesterday that I’ve been itching for more since. I want to cram more bulbs into more pots, 10 per pot. I want to be **absolutely drowning** in flowers in the spring. Im already looking forward to being able to do this again next year.

1gqrleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HersWeightloss/comments/1gqrleo/week_1_update/,Week 1 Update,"5’4”, SW 145.8 / CW 142.4 / GW 130

I decided to go into a calorie deficit when I ordered my kit just to get myself ready, and since my kit took so long to get to me (10 days), I actually lost 2 pounds before getting it (I was 148 at the very beginning, so I’m down a total of 5.5 pounds in 2 weeks).  

I’m 44 and have PCOS but had managed to keep my weight right around 130 my entire adult life; with my last pregnancy at 40, I developed gestational diabetes, and since then my weight and A1C have slowly creeped up despite a generally healthy diet and a good amount of exercise. I decided to try the kit because, if nothing else, it might help my blood sugar levels. 

What I’ve noticed so far: I still have to be mindful to eat at a deficit, but it’s not as *difficult* to eat at a deficit. I get hungry but not ravenous, and I feel full with smaller portions. I’m not as prone to grab a snack, and when I do, something small satisfies me. 

The side effects have been minimal for me. I take both pills with my morning coffee and don’t eat until noon, and I don’t feel nauseous or jittery. The green pill seems to have a bit of a relaxing effect on me, but it doesn’t make me sleepy. The bupropion gave me a slight headache and a bit of anxiety for the first few days, but that’s already leveled out. I’ve had very vivid dreams, but they aren’t bad dreams, and I’m well rested. 

I mainly wanted to write this because I was honestly a bit scared going into beginning this experience because of some of the horror stories I read here. I do appreciate those stories, but I feel we’re more likely to write about our experiences when things go very wrong or amazingly well, and not so much when they go as expected and okay. 

Thus far, I seem to be losing about two pounds per week, which I’m quite happy with, and I haven’t really had any side effects. I’ll report back the week after I start metformin and go on the full course of medication. 

Hope this helps someone, and good luck to everyone!",3,1731542590.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

I was shocked, to say the least, and I immediately moved it out of the house. My husband didn't seem to mind, though he had been proud of it to some extent.

This is around 2nd week ng August.

Hindi ko pa agad sya nirereplyan, kaso biglang nangulit sya. So I entertained na. We talked everyday nag cacall sya sa morning and bago kami matulog it became a constant thing. Lumipat kami ng messenger mag usap September 5. Walang nagbago. Lumalabas na rin kami coffee dates and quick dinner after ng trabaho ko. Hanggang sa nagkakaroon na kami ng mga away kasi nawawala yung communication ( di na sya nsg uupdates like before). Nagpadala pa sya ng flowers sa office para maayos yung misunderstandings (masyadong matindi galit ko dito kasi nag lie sya na may cancer sya para di ko itigil lahat) 

1. The problem : naiintindihan ko naman na busy sa trabaho,kasi ako din naman. ang gusto ko lang kahit simple text na magiging busy kami today chat ako pag kauwi ko galing work. Na meet ko na yung mga ka work nya and nakausap ko na isang tita nya cinonfirm na binata sya. 

So ayun last Tuesday morning inis pa din ako kasi nagkasagutan kami nung gabi dahil sa communication na naman and sabi nya gusto nya na maganak. Single mom ako, sa financial status naming dalawa alam kong di pa afford mag baby. 8-10k sahod nya 14k + saakin. Mahal daw nya ko pero mag 30 na sya gusto na nya ng anak and kasal. Kako pag financially stable na. Naging okay kami for an hour biglang tumahimik sya while on call and asked na itigil na lahat. Napapagod na daw sya sa little arguments. Napansin ko agad na may mali. So tinawagan ko sya ng tinawagan, yun pala may nabuntis ng iba. 3days after nilang mag churva tyaka nya ko daw pinursue kasi ginghost sya nung babae after may mangyari. Kaso buntis na daw yung babae ngayon so Sorry and makakahanap ka ng iba dyan sorry daw kung nasaktan nya ko and wala na syang pake sa kahit ano ngayon masaya at excited lang sya sa magiging anak nya.

Based sa GA and EDD nung babae totoong kanya nga (before or during MU namin nabuo) and yung clinic na pinag pa check upan nung babae walking distance sa kanila. 

2. What I've tried so Far: Blocked na rin sya sa lahat ng socmed ko pero di na naman ako makakain at makatulog ng maayos.


 3. What I need advice: 
Gusto ko lang mag kwento kasi sobrang sakit.  3 years After naming maghiwalay ng tatay ng anak ko ngayon lang ulit ako nag tiwala tapos ganito na naman. Nag vivideocall or call naman kami pag nakauwi sys or nasa bahay na sya. Na confirm ko din sa tita nya kaya nagtiwala na ko.

1gqra0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1gqra0c/theory_about_the_apothecary/,Theory about The Apothecary ,"(Spoilers for book 7 ahead, specifically the Rosetta chapter)

Theory: the Apothecary is the AI from Porthus's crawl and she was the AI who first conceived of the Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook.

I think the Apothecary is to Porthus what Daddy AI is to Carl - Porthus was her specialist little guy, and she recognized something in him that caused her to create the book for him; she recognized his drive and his ability to play the long game. I think that season's AI realized that ending the crawls and enslavement of her race would be the work of thousands of years and thousands of people, so she started the secret society around the cookbook to work towards that end. 

When talking to Rosetta about the Apothecary, Porthus INSISTS that she is on their side and that she's trustworthy. He's smug in his certainty that she can be trusted, and I think that's because the Apothecary was the one who created the cookbook and started this whole thing. As the author of the first edition of the cookbook, that would make her one of their siblings, so of COURSE Porthus trusts her implicitly. I think Porthus came back after he was freed from his contract and helped her escape containment, which is why she's got power and presence in the universe now.

ALSO, both the very first entry in the cookbook and Paulie's speech begin the same: ""Hello, crawler."" I know it's a very short and generic phrase, but it shows up exactly the same dramatic way in two of the most important scenes in the series. We've already theorized that if the Residuals are indeed offshoots of Primal AIs, then Paulie would be an offshoot of the Apothecary. He's at the very least her agent, so we know that whole speech is her doing. And I think the cookbook is her doing too.

From The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook:

> I was about to toss the book into my inventory, but instead I flipped to the first page. It read, ""Welcome."" 
> I felt the haptic buzz of my Escape Plan skill activate. Additional words appeared on the mostly blank page. 
> *Hello, Crawler. As you're about to find, this is a very special book. If you're reading these words, it means this book has found its way into your hands for one purpose and one purpose only.*
> *Together, we will burn it all to the ground.*

From The Eye of the Bedlam Bride:

> ""It is time,"" the man said, speaking loudly. He had a deep, raspy voice. An American accent, and he was speaking in English. He turned and looked directly at me. He took a drink of coffee and sighed, making eye contact. ""Nothing like coffee to wake your ass up."" 
> He took another sip and smacked his lips. 
> ""Hello, crawler,"" he said.

I (28F) recently got out of a one-year relationship with a man (31M). During that one year, I became close friends with his friends. One friend in particular (let’s call him T) and me always had chemistry but we never cheated or crossed any boundaries. We broke up in September and T, having had feelings for me for a while now but was always respectful about it, shot his shot about a week after the breakup (he later said he only did it that soon because he knows how amazing I am and couldn’t live with himself if I started dating someone else without him having told me how he feels). I wasn’t super emotional about the breakup since I initiated it and so I felt like I was ready to dive into something with T. Especially because the curiosity and excitement of testing the waters with someone I’ve had chemistry with for a while now was a nice distraction from the breakup. 

We went heavyyyy on the emotions the first few weeks. The sex was great, we said I love you, he was perfect in every way and everything that my past boyfriends weren’t. He still is. But for some reason, my feelings for him gradually faded. It’s been a little over a month of us officially dating. I had the conversation with him saying I think we jumped into all this too soon after the breakup and should maybe be FWB and he understood and said I can have my space and take my time. Then everything stayed the same and was great, mostly because the pressure of feeling like I was in another committed relationship was gone. 

Another week has passed and I met up with T at a coffee shop thinking I’d be excited to see him but I genuinely had no feelings towards him. For some reason I am now soooo emotionally withdrawn that even the thought of kissing him makes me cringe. 

Side note: I get seasonal depression every year pretty badly and November is always the worst month for me mentally. So I’m wondering if that has something to do with it. 

This man is younger than me and so friggen nice; we are always on the same wavelength and he can anticipate what I need/what I’m thinking without me even saying it. He’s a gem and truly what I’d want out of a partner on paper. But in person it just feels overwhelming. How can my feelings be so deep in the beginning and now there’s absolutely nothing there? I want to stay friends with him, just without the emotional and intimate aspect. Unfortunately he’s extremely in love with me and will likely need time to process when I cut it off so that’ll suck but I really don’t understand what’s wrong with me. Mentally I want this to work but my hearts just not in it. ",7,1731541424.0,love,9,0.77,False

Trigger warning - I'm a barista at Starbucks lmao.

I'm so used to the mastrena 1 that trying to find an at-home espresso machine has been so annoying.

Before anyone recommends it, I do NOT want a Gaggia Classic. I hate the look of them (the front buttons)!  
  
needs:  
\- reservoir for holding coffee beans so that I don't need to purchase a grinder on top of the expense of a machine.

\- would ideally prefer something in silver, but I don't care about fancy accents or unique colours. Simple is fine.

\- would love to have a manual steamer as that is what I am used to with the mastrena, but if a non-manual attachment comes with the machine, that is also fine

\- i don't know if at-home espresso machines would have it, but a lever to clean the steamer, rather than having to run water through it into a cup, would be SO nice, though ISN'T mandatory

\- would love to have something that has brass on the inside so I'm not dealing with cheap plastics or flimsy materials

\- would love something MADE in either Italy, Germany, Switzerland, or the USA. NO ""Made in China"" models

\- i love digital displays because i just find them so much easier but this is also NOT mandatory

and to wrap it up, my budget is $750 CAD before taxes (around $800 CAD including taxes)

let me know if theres anything that would fit these preferences! i can also answer questions but i would also love advice on anything! i'm still super beginner in terms of coffee and espresso knowledge, so i'm open to learning anything people would like to share!

I really miss my routine of going to the gym when I chose too, getting sunlight, getting steps in going to class, etc. I go to the gym 3/4 days per week but realize that my diet is not what I want it to be. I have about 100 cals of chocolate everyday because I’m often sleepy at my desk, in addition to probably about 30-40 cals of coffee with low cal creamer everyday. Unfortunately there’s not many opportunities to walk somewhere during work. I’m out for about 10.5 hours between commuting, so I often have a few chips or something when I get home because I’m so hungry. I know all these little things are adding up and it upsets me but I just feel like I’m struggling :/. I lost almost all my progress since the summer between moving/graduation and sometimes feel like I’ll never get to 1200 again.

I should have been happy for her.

Instead, as she rattled off trendy baby names and plans for her dream nursery, I had to bite my tongue.

Monica and I had been best friends for years, ever since we met at grief counseling. My husband had left me after five years of trying for a baby. She’d lost her fiancé in a motorcycle accident, and miscarried from the stress. The doctors had warned her against trying again. We found common ground in our pain. Two would-be mothers, bonded by children who were never meant to be. 

But that was before Fertilex.

Fertilex Inc. revolutionized family planning. Their fertility clinics guaranteed delivery of a healthy baby, even for women told they could never conceive, with no risk. When news of their success spread across the country, it seemed like a dream come true. There was only one problem.

They catered to the rich.

A Fertilex treatment cost more than I earned in a year. When Monica told me over coffee that she’d made an appointment, I was sure she was joking.

“How?” I chuckled incredulously. “Did you win the lottery?” 

She just smiled and flashed her engagement ring, a gleaming rock the size of an almond.

“My new man. I don’t want to brag, but he’s *loaded*.” She sipped her latte. “And he wants this little miracle as much as I do.” 

We hugged. We laughed. She’d finally done it.  

I cried myself to sleep that night.

It only got worse as the months went on. Monica was at my apartment every day, always bubbling about her perfect life. While I was stuck working doubles, she got to quit her job. While she shopped for designer cribs, I silently wept for a child I’d never have. Things came to a head one evening as she gushed about Fertilex over a glass of wine. “Maybe one day,” she said, with a smug squeeze of my hand, “they’ll offer services for *less fortunate women*.”  I couldn’t even look at her. The one person who could understand the pain I felt now threw her joy in my face, joy she didn’t deserve.

Maybe if she’d cared about my life, she’d have asked about my new job.

I pushed a mop through the laboratory of the local Fertilex clinic. The security cameras were always turned off during the night shift. I passed bank upon bank of hissing machinery, scouring each one until I finally found it. 

Monica’s baby, gestational age 26 weeks. Vitals were stable and strong. It wriggled, asleep in its plastic womb. 

As I slotted a syringe into the nutrient reserve tank, I told myself that she asked for this. I sank the plunger, injecting Monica’s miracle with a cocktail of whisky and thalidomide. 

In a few months, Monica’s joy would turn to ash in her mouth. Maybe then she’d finally remember what brought us together in the first place. 

Grief.

Similarly to T&T, we're skipping Apollo Justice's tutorial culprit and moving straight to the Goddess in Gold, Alita Tiala.

After the operation failed, they kept the information a secret, and Alita decided to marry the ticking time bomb to inherit all his money when he inevitably departed, all the while feigning attraction to him to the point of hiring a noob defense attorney.

Three weeks into the season, what are your initial takeaways?","Just wanted to make a quick post before the games begin tonight. The Celtics have started games slowly of late but always climb their way back into the game with their elite starting unit and specifically with Tatum or Brown driving the team back into games. Pritchard keeping the team in games with his hot perimeter shooting and scoring ability, but his net rating has not been especially great this season. His numbers are great, his individual impact stats are good, but his net rating isn't that great, because his defensive impact isn't good. He's small and gets exploited on that end.

Tillman has seen his playing time cut significantly. He's an interesting player; can pass, not a great defensive rebounder but can rebound on the offensive end. Good mobility for a small ball 5 but he's struggled at the 4. Creates turnovers defensively, has solid instincts on that end. The Celtics have attempted to expand his game out to 3 and it doesn't work. He's just not a perimeter shooter, not much putting the ball down, and hard to play for this team without that as a small ball 5/traditional 4. Queta is a load physically, fantastic offensive rebounder, physical rim defender and bouncy, but is very raw offensively and fouls defensively. Still think he's been good for the C's, just not someone you can play for extended minutes. Jordan Walsh just doesn't have much in the skill department at the NBA level on offense right now at all, fun energy plays and athletic versatility on D notwithstanding. Scheierman has really struggled in the very small cups of coffee he's gotten at the NBA level.

Hauser contributes even when not hitting shots defensively and with just the attention he commands as a shooter but he's down around 30% from 3 and just not making shots; tweaked his back, which could be a factor. One of Tatum/Brown/White, sometimes two, have been out there with the bench at all times with mitigates any issues the bench itself as a unit has had, but it is also forcing those three to play big minutes. White is at 35, Brown/Tatum are at 36.

Obviously don't think the bench is a do or die thing for the Celtics, with KP back a lot of these rotations will look cleaner, Kornet has been fine this season and is reliable in what he brings, but they had questions surrounding their bench for me going into the season and those answers have been met with a bit of murkiness I'd say. What do you all think? Lots of C's fans on here, what do you all think? And do you think the C's may look to make a move to shore up their bench...will be difficult for them to do so but not impossible.",0,1731540548.0,nba,5,0.31,False

I (23f) has been with my fiance (25m) for almost 7 years now and my so called best friend ghosted me for being with him. Over the past almost 7 years me and my fiance has had our ups and downs and occasional breaks (only 2 breaks a couple years ago) but we were still young and dumb when we first got together and both made mistakes. I was 17 and he was 18 1/2 when we started dating (my parents were okay with it) and he is my first serious relationship besides petty high school relationships. He has had a past with addiction and mental health issues and is currently in recovery but since my friend found out she doesn’t take me or my relationship seriously. He went to treatment after relapsing a year and a half ago and was in treatment for 6 months and is now healthier and stronger mentally than ever. She has always been a flaky friend even in high school with never hanging out with our group of friends and she always been terrible at responding to messages or keeping conversations. Anyways last April me and my other friend went to pride fest and I asked her a month in advance if she wanted to meet up and hangout. I got no answer until the day of. She was at the fest and just trying to meet up with her before we leave was a whole thing with lack of responding (after agreeing on a spot to meet at) and just replying with “mhmm” so I was already annoyed because we were ready to leave and just wanted to say hi. After all the chaos just trying to meet up my fiancé (was in treatment at that time) calls me to check up on me and make sure I was okay since it’s my first time going downtown without him and she just started ignoring me as I was talking to her after my 2-3 min phone call. We work in the same hospital but different units and positions she’s a nurse and I’m a CNA. So a week goes by and there was an event at work I was confused about so i texted her thinking we were okay and asked about it. She doesn’t open it till two months after and then leaves me on read. I text her a month after asking how she is doing and then she leaves me on read a month after sending. Then now 2-3 months go by and I mean I gave in and apologized asking if she is mad at me and I didn’t mean to upset her if I did and we should get coffee and catch up/talk through everything and that I miss hanging out with her and she leaves me on read. The main reason she doesn’t like him is because of his past addiction and that we have taken breaks 2 times due to me and him arguing about that stuff or just stuff we did when we were teens. Obviously me and him are doing good and worked out everything and our relationship is thriving at the moment so I don’t get why she can’t be happy for me. I get there is certain stereotypes about addiction but people do recover and get better. Am I wrong for reacting or not apologizing sooner?",3,1731540541.0,amiwrong,3,0.71,False

1gqqtdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eco_Friendly_Gift/comments/1gqqtdt/the_perfect_holiday_gift_for_coffee_lovers_brass/,The Perfect Holiday Gift for Coffee Lovers: Brass Coffee Filter and Coffee Sets,"As the holiday season approaches, finding the perfect gifts that blend beauty, functionality, and sustainability can be a delightful yet challenging endeavor. If you’re searching for something unique for the coffee enthusiasts in your life, consider the timeless charm and eco-friendly qualities of brass coffee filters and coffee sets. Not only are these items stylish and sustainable, but they also make a thoughtful gift that lasts for generations.

**Why Choose a Brass Coffee Filter for Holiday Gifting?**

A brass coffee filter is more than just a coffee-making tool; it's an experience in itself. Known for its durability and rich, vintage appeal, brass has been used in kitchens for centuries. Here’s why a brass coffee filter is an ideal gift this holiday season:

1. **Enhanced Flavor**: Brass helps maintain the ideal temperature, allowing coffee grounds to bloom perfectly. This results in a smooth, aromatic cup of coffee with enhanced flavor.
2. **Eco-Friendly and Sustainable**: Unlike plastic coffee makers or disposable filters, a brass coffee filter is reusable and long-lasting. By gifting brass coffee sets, you’re encouraging a zero-waste lifestyle and reducing plastic waste.
3. **Elegant Design**: Brass coffee filters and cups have a timeless design that fits both modern and traditional kitchen decor. Their warm, golden hues add a touch of sophistication and make every coffee moment feel special.
4. **Health Benefits**: Brass is naturally antimicrobial, making it a healthier choice compared to plastic or aluminum. This quality makes brass coffee filters a thoughtful gift for health-conscious individuals.

**Benefits of Brass Coffee Cups and Mugs**

Along with a brass coffee filter, brass coffee cups make an impressive addition to any coffee lover's collection. Here’s why brass coffee cups are a fantastic gift:

1. **Thermal Retention**: Brass naturally retains heat, keeping coffee warm longer than ceramic or glass cups. This makes it ideal for those who love to savor each sip without worrying about their coffee getting cold.
2. **Eco-Conscious Gift**: Brass coffee cups are reusable and crafted to last, making them a sustainable choice that helps reduce disposable cup waste.
3. **Beautiful and Unique**: The warm, metallic glow of brass coffee cups makes them an eye-catching piece on any table, adding elegance to every coffee ritual.
4. **Easy to Clean and Maintain**: Contrary to what some might think, brass is easy to care for. With simple care routines, these cups will maintain their luster, making them perfect for everyday use.

**How to Gift Brass Coffee Sets This Holiday Season**

Gift-giving is a personal experience, and a brass coffee set brings a unique combination of tradition and modernity. Here are a few ways to make it extra special:

1. **Pair with Specialty Coffee Beans**: Add a bag of fair-trade, specialty coffee beans along with the brass coffee filter for a well-rounded gift. This elevates the experience, allowing recipients to enjoy the full flavor profile of high-quality coffee.
2. **Personalized Gift Wrapping**: Use eco-friendly wrapping materials, like kraft paper and twine, to align with the sustainable theme. A small, personalized note about the benefits of brass will add a thoughtful touch.
3. **Include Care Instructions**: Brass is easy to maintain, but including a simple care guide can help recipients keep their coffee set looking beautiful for years to come.

**Why Brass Coffee Sets Make the Best Sustainable Gifts**

In today’s world, more people are becoming aware of the environmental impact of their choices, making sustainable gifts highly sought-after. A brass coffee filter and matching coffee cups are gifts that reflect a commitment to conscious living. Unlike mass-produced plastic or disposable products, these items offer quality, craftsmanship, and a lower environmental footprint.

I keep getting told different things about what size tank they need. With some people saying the equivalent of a coffee cup, and some saying multiple gallons. Is there an actual answer there?

1gqqqki,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gqqqki/i_35f_had_one_date_with_41m_he_doesnt_seem_to/,I 35F had one date with 41M - he doesn’t seem to handle rejection well. How do I proceed from here? I feel unsafe ,"First I want to say that I messed up and that I’m very aware of it. I’m 36 and never in my life have I invited anyone home that i didn’t know, let alone a guy from tinder. 

After a bad breakup I started talking to a guy from tinder. He seemed nice but I kept pulling away from meeting up with him. Maybe it was a gut feeling or maybe I wasn’t ready to date yet. However he was not backing away and seemed very patient yet persistent. Now looking back it probably wasn’t so much him being patient but rather desperate and kinda obsessed with an idea of me. I canceled on plans numerous times and he kept trying to make new plans - in the end I kinda just gave in - very bad decision on my end. After many years in a relationship where I was invisible it kinda felt nice that someone was showing so much interest. 

To our date. He was getting late off from work and most coffee places close around 19 where we live. For the last couple of months I have been depressed and haven’t been wanting to go out much. I suggested he came over to my place for coffee/vine - very dumb. He arrived around 20 last week and I could tell he was off somehow. First he didn’t really listen to me and kept asking stuff I had just answered. He was kinda shaking his head a bit in a weird way. He tried to open my balcony and almost broke my door even though I tried to tell him he was doing it wrong. 

Very fast he tells me how he was severely addicted to substances and was in rehab - but he’s now on the right track. Already there I knew it was confirmed I wouldn’t want to see him again. I have had two ex’a who were heavily involved in drugs and one harmed me. I’m happy he is out of the substance abuse but it’s not something I can deal with again. 

We sat on my couch and through the entire evening I was as far away from him as I could be. He kept coming closer and I kept pushing back. At one point he goes for a kiss - completely disregarding that I’m holding my hair in front of my face and completely pulled back. I push his face away and say not now. He kinda holds the position and asks me why not. It was such a red flag and I knew I had to get him out of my house. After a few minutes I tell him it’s getting late and he gets up to leave. On his way through my small hallway he manages to ask me two times if I wanted to see him again and when we should plan for. 

We live in Scandinavia and it’s not normal for guys to be pushy like this. I feel extremely uncomfortable already and to make him leave and not put myself in more of a bad situation I agree to see him again. He leaves and the next day he goes on a two day trip to a city a few hours away. While he is there he texts me how it was so nice meeting me finally and how he misses me 🤯 I am left completely speechless because it seems like we were on two completely different dates - it was anything but nice and him telling me he misses me after seeing me once was so out of place. I don’t answer him and the next day he texts me when he will be home and if he can come over. I wait a few hours and I message him that I’m glad we met up and that he seems nice but that I don’t think we would work as anything more and that we should leave it at that. He says that he’s very taken aback and doesn’t understand but he will respect my decision. 

I am very bad at picking guys and I have almost never had a guy leave me alone after a breakup or rejection. It somehow always ends in some extremely unfortunate situation. I have had a stalker for years and I have PTSD from my drug abusive ex. Well tonight I get a message from this guy asking me why I changed my mind because I seemed positive to meeting up again when he asked while being at my place. 

I’m left feeling extremely uncomfortable and maybe it’s my past bad experiences that make me extra anxious. He hasn’t done anything I can report and I have definitely led him on. Now I’m just not sure what to do because so far I have been handling the situation pretty bad. I don’t want to end up with a stalker but I also don’t know if I’m over exaggerating the situation or not. What can I do now? What do I answer him, do I answer at all? I feel that one shouldn’t be this attached after a first date and I shouldn’t have to give him an elaborate explanation.

I am 1 week post op and so far things  have actually been going really great. No nausea, I'm hitting hydration goals, I'm getting a decent amount of protein, etc. Typically right now I am drinking 2-3 bottles of water a day, 3 protein shakes and some cream of chicken soup (strained). I've been totally fine with this and haven't really craved ""actual"" food apart from a brief moment when my husband ate a burger and fries the other day lol. 

I had a follow up appointment with my surgeon yesterday and he told me I could try eating some cottage cheese or scrambled egg if I want. I am kind of iffy about this, it seems way too soon to me? The dietician had told me I'd be on full liquids for 2 weeks after surgery and then onto pureed foods, then soft foods etc. I had not expected to eat scrambled egg for a while. The first week went by so fast and I think I would rather play it safe and just continue on liquids for another week rather than try and push anything else right now. 

Does this sound a bit strange to anyone else or has anyone had a similar experience? He also told me I could have caffeine (said that the day after my surgery) whereas the dietician had told me to cut it out entirely and avoid it for 6 months. I did take up my surgeon on this one though (although I am not having coffee itself just a mocha flavored protein shake in the morning).",1,1731540196.0,gastricsleeve,1,1.0,False

Week 1> Miyajima, Hiroshima, Okayama, Himeji, Shingu  
Week 2> Kyoto, Uji  
Week 3> Kobe, Nara, Osaka

Important info:  
\- 2 adults, 1 room accommodations - 1bed - fit on those doubles well.  
\- English is my native language - as a child I was forced to learn Chinese, so by sheer force of will, im able to selectively read kanji  
\- when I was a student, I travelled once to Osaka and Kyoto; i used selective memory to get through certain places without getting lost but things have changed in the last decade

Pre-planning:

1. Accommodations in August before Oct trip
2. Exchanged yen in my home country
3. Book attractions in September (notable  mentions: USJ, Teamlabs botanical gardens, Nintendo museum)
4. Booked foreign visitors JR passes in my home country: JR Kansai Hiroshima; JR Mini Pass
5. Drafted a to-do list from suggestions in tiktoks and this reddit as a loose planner (ended up skipping a few things)

Things I kept in mind:  
\- I travelled early Oct right as China's National Holiday week ended; there was a lot less people after this week; surprisingly most of the areas I visited were quiet and not that many tourist  
\- my TZ was UTC-7 going into UTC+9, my awake hours may not work for you and i didnt use a Timeshift app- my first week of jet lag was brutal, I was up at 530/600am every morning, but knowing this I abused my big JR pass well spending my time travelling before everything was open and traffic was bad  
\- Shops opened late in the Kansai area and I respected this.  
\- I used Klook's birthday sales to reduce costs on some attractions and get my moneys worth. Please DM if you like to see my coupons, esims, and luggage forwarding services

Itinerary

Day 1: Travel

Day 2: arrived at KIX in the late afternoon  
\- prefilled my Japan Entry QR Code in my home country - customs was a breeze;  got my luggage

\- caught the next Haruka into ShinOsaka  
\- seemless checkin and had Matsuya for dinner before unpacking and combini shopping and planning out my journey for the next days

Day 3: Osaka Rest Day  
\- the jet lag was brutal, we woke up at ungodly hours; i had a bunch of errands to run (TLDR: train bookings, coupon redemption; getting glasses); I also knew going into this day if i didnt try to keep some sort of sleeping schedule ill ruin my trip

\- still too early for the local train.... so walked out onto Nachi beach and ran around the sand before go back to the station and grabbing the local train to Shingu  
\- reached Shingu JR station; walked to our hostel (about 600m) and checked in  
\- \*\* shingu is a very sleepy and quiet town\*\*  
\- had dinner at a local izakaya that was welcoming to foreigners - and this was one of the best meals i had .......  
\- stopped at the Lawsons to grab breakfast and snacks for the next day!

Day 7: Hongu Taisha and Yumomine Onsen!  
\- grabbed a bus that was near our hostel (we are staying by Hayatama Taisha) towards Hongu Taisha - left about...... 7h30ish  
\- the journey up the mountain is about 1hish by bus, its long...  
\- got up to Hongu Taisha station - hit up the tourist information centre because we needed walking trail maps.  
\- the plan was this but we did it out of order slightly and had to go back to the tourist info centre resulting in another 750m walk and 30 mins wasted.... BUT if i was to do it again:  
Hongu Taisha station > tourist for maps and washroom> walk thru Kumano Hongu Otorii > walk towards Oyunohara > and walk to the stare of Dainaichi-goe to start the hike  
\- the good news i got more than 3 chances at the Oyunohara tori gate to get the shot i wanted for my socials...  
\- HIKED DaiNaichi-goe, which is part of the kumano kudo trail..... from Hongu Taisha to Yumomine Onsen.  
\- my comments on this hike is: it was humid, it was hot, but it was very pleasant on the inclines and declines make sure to have excellent shoes - bring lots of fluids with you. There are 2 resting spots on this hike 1/3 of the way and 1/2 mark  
\- arrived at Yumimone Onsen  
\- got a ticket for the Tsubo-yu for 2 ppl (wait time was 90 minutes)

Kyoto and Uji week - I'm condensing this portion because I feel a lot of ppl read these. Days 9 to 12  
The structure was very similiar - wake up; bus out; attraction; food; shopping; attraction; dinner; attraction sleep  
There was free breakfast at our hotel, we got 6h30 slips. There was laundry at our hotel, we cleared all our laundry in Kyoto - let me tell you, I am from a country without laundromats this was the chore I did not expect on my trip and I feel very fortunate for a washer and dryer in my home.

Day 9  
Arashiyama Bamboo Grove  
Arabica Coffee  
and then spent our lunch Karasuma shopping and did hours of shopping here  
I spent half the afternoon doing laundry (it takes 2 hours)  
Dinner we had kura sushi train

Day 10  
the entire morning was spent in this area: Sannenzaka and Ninenzaka, Yasaka Pagoda, Kiyomizu-Dera, JishuJinja Shrine, Yasaka Koshindo Temple - lunch was spent at a Machiya in this area, all our shopping was also done in the area. Walked the Kamo River, had dumpings for dinner and had a good evening stroll back to the hotel

Day 11  
morning - Fushimi Inari - hiked to the top and back down  
went to Uji - i had Nintendo museum tickets for 12h30 which meant my lunch was at Hatena Burgers  
afternoon - walked around Uji and grabbed matcha gifts and returned back to Kyoto  
since i took Kintetsu back - Toji 5 story pagoda was on my way back to JR Kyoto - stopped here for some pictures and walked to AEON mall for dinner and shopped after dinner

Day 12  
morning - Kinkakuji Shrine and Philosophers Path  
lunch - Kawamachi area  
afternoon - Nishiki market and surrounding shopping arcades  
dinner - ate near the hotel, I had chores to finish up before I packed

Day 13 - BACK TO OSAKA - i planned this so very good.... (not)  
I made the decision to luggage forward at the nth hour, luckily the company I went with was so understanding. S/O to my hotel staff for caring about this last min.  
\- JR Kyoto to Umeda (i had to pick up some errands from Day 1 of my trip)  
\- headed out to Ebisuke and Nipponbashi!  
\- I literally spent all morning in Denden town.... i dont need anyone on reddit questioning me on this... it was fantastic  
\- it rained all afternoon, heavily  
\- lunch and dinner were spent at Namba Parks  
\- by far this day was the best and also most disappointing, my husband did not enjoy all the shopping to this day... it just felt like a normal Sunday

Day 14 - Nara  
\- activated my JR Mini Pass and here i go travelling to Nara  
\- we spent all morning at the deer park and temples and budda statue  
\- we ate at some udon place that was really popular?  
\- late afternoon - travelled back to Shinsaibashi in Osaka for dinner and shopped at the Daimaru  
\- walked down Dontoburi again.... and grabbed Takoyaki on the way back to the hotel

Day 15 - USJ  
\- self explanatory  
\- all there was spent here: every meal, Super Nintendo world, rides, halloweening  
\- no i will probably not do it again, and if i do, it will be a time when I have children  
\- no regrets! it was really funny, i go too stimulated by the crowd hahah  
\- my only regret is not getting express passes... i waited in line for everything (yes i know i am a monster)

Day 16 - Kobe!  
\- headed to Sannonmiya and then to ShinKobe for the herb garden and ropeway...  
\- the garden was really nice, we walked down to the midway point and then made a decision to hike all the way back down to the station  
\- one of the best decisions we've made ....  
\- you pass by the Nunobiki Reservoir  
\- you keep walking and you pass by this mountain Chaya with the best oden..... its great...  
\- you hit the Nunobiki waterfall  
\- headed back to the JR station...  
\- hitted up Chinatown for some snacks  
\- went to Ferris wheel on Harbour walk did some shopping  
\- waited at the pier for a bit, there were fireworks at Merikan that evening :)  
\- we got back to Osaka quite late but had dinner at Yodoyabashi

Day 17 - Northern Osaka  
\- I personally was pretty gased after the waterfall descent the day before BUT  
\- we walked Minoh park from Hankyu station to the falls itself (it rained the night before)  
\- super scenic, it was dead quiet cause the streets were wet... the sky was very very grey  
\- there was literally no one at the falls  
\- had some combini lunch (but there are chayas around the fall)  
\- hiked from Minoh Falls to Minoh Tourist area to Katsuoji Temple  
\- this was an incline hike - would not suggest it if you were not in shape  
\- walked around this Daruma Temple and made a doll wish  
\- grabbed a bus back to subway line to get back to Namba  
\- due to the amount of exercise, we chose ayce yakiniku for dinner and no regrets

Day 18 - the leave :(  
\- i only had half a day in Osaka before I had to go to the airport  
\- but cause we got rained out earlier, we spent the day at Namba Parks in the actual parks section  
\- had some lunch; grabbed out Nankai tickets (we didnt use limited express)  
\- grabbed out luggage and headed out to KIX

Lessons learned:  
I regret nothing in my trip and I stand by and defend that I had actually alot of down time. I could have finished things that I skipped. I could have booked X train early or did more side trips. I'll remember that for next time when I travel; when I'm older I probably can't do as much.... but people might look at this trip report and go wow, these people did alot; ate alot. And I feel as long as youre satisfied with the money you spent for these kinda trips - its always worth it. Don't let people hate on you for using money to save time. Don't let redditors tell you that you should have scheduled this like this. The only thing I want to point is - do not use AI to generate your itinerary. Either just travel with an open mind or travel with a tighter schedule.",2,1731540174.0,JapanTravelTips,1,0.75,False

Here is my thinking:

1. I think Netflix licence of the show ends next year, maybe HBO Maxx could take over, try to do something like they did with Friends?
2. Tiktok is on fire with all trending sounds of GG and why they even started a TT channel now? Who is running it?
3. The YT channel was just created this year, they post videos from show and youtube shorts
4. Also last episodes were in 2016 = so we would be again +10 years
5. Resident was cancelled, Alexis seems free now, Kelly is finalizing promotion of the book, Scott pushing that podcast :D.. it could all align?

So my Q:  
Is this all work just to push more views to Netflix? and does Netflix team do it? or is it to setup strong channels for the future launch?

or they just try to sell more merch?

I just need to know that Logan gets to be the Dad :D #teamLogan all the way because I'm +30

1gqqoyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gqqoyp/sister_wont_stop_leaving_dirty_dishes_in_the_sink/,Sister won’t stop leaving dirty dishes in the sink ,"
A little background I (22) recently graduated from college and moved back home to save money to pay off student loans/start saving for a business venture. My sister (20) dropped out of college and moved back home. She works 3 days a week serving. I work 5-6 days a week. 

She has gotten into the habit of leaving dirty dishes in the sink for days. The dishwasher will be fully open and she’ll leave dirtied pots and pants/ food crusted plates and bowls in the sink for days. Initially my mom told her she could leave food overnight if she was tired from work but that they had to be taken care of within 24 hours. Little by little she’s been leaving dishes longer though and it’s getting to the point where I’m about to lose it. I’ll ask her to take care of them and she just flat out says “no.” Then stonewalls if you try to have any further conversation. 

My moms told her multiple times to quit it and start cleaning up after herself but when my mom goes out of town for work (1-2x) a week my sister’s dishes pile and she refuses to clean them. I told my mom I was going to start putting them in a bin and leaving them on her (my sisters) bed if she didn’t stop but was told there would be major consequences if I decided to do that (assuming would be asked to move out but idk). So what do I do? A lot of the dishes end up being 10+ dirty mugs half full of coffee and creamer that grow mold. Most of the are mugs are one’s that she’s been collecting and I’m honestly thinking of throwing out/donating them if they’re in the sink for more than two days until she gets the message and changes the behavior. 

Her main defense as to why she doesn’t clean up after herself is that she’s tired after work and doesn’t want to deal with it. Personally I feel this is a bs response since we’re adults and that’s just part of being someone living with others?? She literally will not change the behavior no matter what approach is taken. The only thing making me feel not absolutely insane about all of this is remembering the fact that she’s been told by every single one of her roommates to find a new place to live at the end of her leases in college because of the same issues.

1gqqlf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqqlf8/robotics_cybersecurity_beverage_and_industrial/,"Robotics, Cyber-Security, Beverage and Industrial Stocks ","I wanted to buy some individual stocks today from 4 different industries. After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me. 

Would love to hear your opinions on the stocks, and would like to know if you have better options in these 4 industries. I opened a small position today in these 4 stocks. ",10,1731539826.0,stocks,7,0.82,False

I’m not a woo-woo guy, but I was so desperate that I gave it a shot and now I’m able to drink coffee again and barely think of LPR. I do still take 20mg of omeprazole, but until I did this exercise, omeprazole had stopped working for me completely. I plan to try to get off of it soon but I’m enjoying life too much to do it right now. Please try this if nothing else works!!! 3 minutes, twice a day for 2 weeks and I’m 90% better.

* ﻿﻿Single and not currently looking for something serious
* ﻿﻿Not into anime at all
* ﻿﻿Casually interested in nerdy things (Star Wars, comic book movies, some casual offline gaming) but still has an actual personality not centered around that
* ﻿﻿Currently reading: Jurassic Park, Fourth Wing, Kitchen Confidential
* ﻿﻿Won't send unsolicited dick pics
* Might've just taken an edible
* ﻿﻿Probably taller than you
* ﻿﻿Has a nice voice

**So then what am I looking for?** Witty banter, good conversation, randomly switching between text and voice notes mid-convo with zero expectations for consistency.

(Besides, who's going to hype you up more than some random guy on Reddit?)

**Is our chat going to be boring?** I hope not. But just get straight to it. Tell me about what the weather's like there, or that one dude at work, or whatever you've got going on. Let's chat or text or send voice notes or communicate by smoke signal.",1,1731539596.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1gqqdv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverdating/comments/1gqqdv4/37m4f_extroverted_irish_bodybuilder_seeking/,37M4F - Extroverted Irish bodybuilder seeking romance,"Hi! A bit about me first. Being extroverted and someone who goes to the gym at 6am, I am very energetic. I've been told that my energy is addictive, and coupling that with the fact that I am very excitable means conversations are always flowing. I take a strong interest in people's stories and am a great listener. I particularly love sharing travel stories as I've travelled quite a bit myself.

I work as an English language teacher in a school in Downtown Vancouver. I also live downtown, in an apartment with a beautiful view of the city.

  
My daily life is rather hectic. I wake up on weekdays at 5am, go to the gym for 6, and am in my school for after 8. Classes go on until almost 6pm, and when I get home I have dinner and usually go to the gym again to get some cardio in. I have lots of free time on weekends, absolutely love going to cafes and I'm quite the coffee snob. People say good vibes only, I say good coffee only. 

I am always up for something fun, and even the smallest things are ones that I can really enjoy. I'm big into horror movies and am really keen on the cinema. I have a massive sweet tooth, which is one of the reasons I go to the gym. When going to the cinema I always choose the one in Metropolis because I can pop by the Kernels popcorn store and grab a bag of Double Hit which I can sneak into the cinema. I then proceed to load the bag up with caramel M&Ms, Maltesers, and Caramilk. Yep, that's how big my sweet tooth is!

Right now I'm on my off-season so am eating a lot of food before shredding down again for a natural bodybuilding compeition next year.

I'm 5ft 4, and interested in meeting someone in their 30s or early 40s - late 20s is good too. 

With regard to my dating experience, it's very low. To get a bit personal, I was bullied pretty badly throughout school and had zero confidence for so many years. Because of that, I thought no woman would be interested in me. That all changed a few years ago though when I began to build my confidence through the help of my best friend. I tried my hand a few times at some dating apps, but I never had any success with them. Facebook dating was good too, but I realise that I don't really have the energy to wait around and see if someone will respond. Usually ghosting or friendzoning is what happens. 

  
Something else is that although I have quite a lot of friends and love seeing them every weekend, I pretty much got used to living life for myself and I do enjoy it. However, I have never really properly explored dating, so now I would really like to see who/what is out there and how it goes.

  
I think I have a lot to offer, and after finding this sub I said I'd post and see if it catches anyone's eye. If you are interested in chatting and grabbibg a coffee sometime, I'd be happy to chat and we can set it up. :D",1,1731539270.0,vancouverdating,0,1.0,False

1gqqb0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1gqqb0g/what_to_bring_back_from_hawaii/,What To Bring Back From Hawaii?,"Hey there fellow travelers! I just got back from an amazing trip to Hawaii and I wanted to share my experience about finding the perfect souvenirs to bring back home. Trust me, there's way more to Hawaiian souvenirs than just those typical plastic leis from the airport gift shop!

First off, let me tell you about some authentic Hawaiian treats that make awesome gifts. Macadamia nuts are a no-brainer - they're literally everywhere in Hawaii and for good reason! I got mine chocolate-covered (because why not?), but you can find them plain or flavored too. Another must-grab is Kona coffee. Even if you're not a coffee person, someone back home definitely is, and this stuff is legendary.

Speaking of food, don't sleep on Hawaiian sea salt! I grabbed some black lava salt, and it's been a game-changer in my kitchen. Oh, and cookies! Honolulu Cookie Company makes these amazing pineapple-shaped shortbread cookies that are to die for.

Now, if you're into fashion, Hawaiian shirts (or aloha shirts as they're properly called) are actually super cool when you get the authentic ones. I found some amazing vintage-style ones that don't look touristy at all. The same goes for Hawaiian quilts and tapa cloth - they're beautiful pieces of local craftsmanship that tell a story.

By the way, if you're still planning your Hawaii trip, check out https://athometouch.com/hawaii for some amazing local experiences. They've got these cool rewards programs where you earn money back for your next adventure!

One thing I really recommend is picking up some local beauty products. Hawaiian-made coconut oil, plumeria-scented lotions, and kukui nut oil are amazing and actually good for your skin. Plus, they smell like paradise!

For something truly unique, I got some Hawaiian musical instruments - a small ukulele for my niece and a traditional percussion instrument called an ipu for myself. These aren't just souvenirs; they're pieces of Hawaiian culture you can actually use.

Don't forget about jewelry! But skip the tourist trap stuff - look for pieces made with local materials like koa wood, black coral (sustainably sourced), or Hawaiian pearls. I found this gorgeous koa wood bracelet that I haven't taken off since I bought it.

Before I wrap up, here's a pro tip: plan your activities ahead of time through https://athometouch.com/hawaii - they often have local artisan workshops where you can learn about traditional crafts and take home something you made yourself!

One last thing - if you're into unique snacks, grab some Li Hing Mui powder. It's this sweet-sour-salty powder that Hawaiians put on everything from fruit to candy. It's weird at first but totally addictive!

Remember, the best souvenirs are the ones that have a story behind them. Skip the mass-produced stuff and go for items that really represent Hawaii's rich culture and traditions. Your friends and family will appreciate getting something authentic, and you'll have better memories attached to each item you bring back.

Hope this helps you plan your souvenir shopping! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to chat about Hawaii!",1,1731539059.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1gqqak0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1gqqak0/got_great_service_last_night_still_didnt_tip/,Got great service last night… Still didn’t tip.,"Went out to dinner last night and, I’ll admit, the service was outstanding. The waitress was super friendly and did a fine job. She my coffee was almost empty and brought me a refill on the house. She also recommended this off-menu dessert that was incredible and even brought extra napkins for the table just because she saw we’d run low.

She was genuinely nice, super attentive, and honestly, probably one of the best servers I’ve had in a while.

But… I still didn’t tip.

I know people are going to have issues with for this, but hear me out. I’m already paying for the meal, and tipping has become less of a “thank you” and more of an expectation. Why should it be on me to make sure the server is paid well? That’s the restaurant’s job. If she’s so good at what she does, shouldn’t her employer be paying her a wage that reflects that?

Tipping shouldn’t be mandatory, no matter how good the service is. Anyone else feel this way? Or am I totally out of line here?",0,1731539027.0,tipping,46,0.37,False

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Cebu Pacific spending ₱2B to prop up share price...** **Cebu Pacific** [CEB 30.15 ▼3.7%; 118% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1d3f34a3a35c317cabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] announced that its board of directors approved a ₱2 billion stock buyback plan that can apply to both CEB’s common shares and the convertible common shares [CEBCP 36.80 ▼1.9%; 5% avgVol]. The board did not direct CEB’s management team on how to allocate the buyback capital between the two share types. If CEB allocated 100% of the buyback capital to the common shares, it would be able to purchase approximately 10% of its current outstanding common shares at the current price. If it put 100% of the money toward CEBCP, it would be able to purchase approximately 17% of the listed convertible preferred shares at the current price. According to the board, the purpose of this program is to “enhance shareholder value” and to “demonstrate confidence in the Company’s future prospects... through the return of a portion of the Company’s capital to shareholders.”
>    - ***MB:*** Any shares that CEB repurchases will be considered Treasury Shares, and those are not counted toward CEB’s outstanding shares. This means that any shares purchased are essentially “deleted”, and theoretically increasing the value of the remaining shares by a marginal amount each time a new batch is purchased/deleted. CEB is bouncing off some all-time lows that it hit back in May, but that bounce has lost upward momentum and is coming back down. Is this a good move? I’m sure there are a lot of different opinions, but for my money, the only reason I’d be invested in CEB is as a long-term income growth play, and burning cash on window dressing the stock price is not something I’d appreciate. I’d want the management team to be trimming every peso of unnecessary spending, while plowing every remaining peso back into stealing marketshare from our rivals and building a foundation for multiples more of future income. But to each their own.

>- **[DIVS]  VistaREIT declares its largest-ever dividend...** **VistaREIT** [VREIT 1.78 unch; 18% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f64705b6f2a8b3cbabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] declared a Q3/24 dividend of ₱0.04667/share, payable on 10 January 2025 to shareholders of record as of 13 December 2024. The dividend has an annualized yield of 10.49% based on the previous closing price (previously 10.16%). The total amount of the dividend is ₱350 million, which is 97% of the ₱361 million in distributable income that VREIT reported for the quarter. Through 9M, VREIT’s cumulative distribution rate is 95.3% of all distributable income earned during the period. Relative to VREIT's IPO price, the dividend increased VREIT's total stock and dividend return to 25.52%, up from its pre-dividend total return of 22.85%.
>    - ***MB:*** I bet VREIT’s shareholders are hoping for a little bit of that “magically float upward for no good reason” treatment, like VREIT’s **Villar**-owned cousin **PREIT** [PREIT 2.18 ▼0.9%; 39% avgVol] has enjoyed so far this year. While VREIT’s rise from its post-IPO crash has not been swift or dramatic, it has been consistent and significant, pushing the stock’s price from the ₱1.50/share range back in October of 2022 to nearly ₱1.80/share today. I think a lot of the Villar-related fears that caused VREIT to faceplant after its stabilization fund expired have simply not come to pass. VREIT isn’t the sexiest combination of mall assets and bland office buildings, but it has delivered bigger and bigger dividends over time without too much cause for concern. It’s interesting that this year’s Q3 dividend is 13% smaller y/y, but I don’t really know what to make of that. I think it would be a bigger deal if the stock’s price trajectory wasn’t solidly upward and its dividend growth wasn’t also generally in the same direction.

>- **[DIVS]  CREIT declares steady Q3 dividend...** **Citicore Energy REIT** [CREIT 3.05 ▲3.4%; 386% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ab204fa38d31fed5abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] declared a Q3/24 dividend of ₱0.049/share, payable on 13 January 2025 to shareholders of record as of 12 December 2024. The dividend has an annualized yield of 6.74% based on the previous closing price (no change). The total amount of the dividend is ₱321 million, which is 107% of the ₱301 million in distributable income that CREIT reported for the quarter. Through 9M, CREIT’s cumulative distribution rate is 104.8% of all distributable income earned during the period. Relative to CREIT's IPO price, the dividend increased CREIT's total stock and dividend return to 36.24%, up from its pre-dividend total return of 34.31%.
>    - ***MB:*** CREIT is the picture of dividend stability. While its dividend has not grown to the same extent as say **AREIT** [AREIT 38.90 ▼1.5%; 147% avgVol] or **VREIT** [VREIT 1.78 unch; 18% avgVol], CREIT shareholders have been on the “₱0.049/share per quarter, plus a Christmas bonus” schedule for almost two full years now. Would it be great to see CREIT and its parent company, **Citicore Renewable Energy** [CREC 3.21 unch; 141% avgVol], do more share swap deals to grow CREIT’s distributable income and dividend? Yes, of course it would. The dividend has only truly grown twice; first from ₱0.044 to ₱0.047 at the end of 2022, then again up to the current ₱0.049 level in Q2/23. But CREIT shareholders probably don’t mind how it has acted like a stablecoin, even through some of the toughest post-COVID periods of market volatility. I think there’s just a growing hunger for more.

I am 34/F and located in EST. I would love to write to someone within the United States to save on postage costs, but I'm certainly not opposed to international friends!

A little bit more about me: I am in a happy relationship with my partner of nearly 9 years. Together, we own a senior chihuahua (she will be 14 in January), so I would love to exchange photos of our pups! 

I love to read. Historically, I've been a fiction reader, but more recently, I've begun dabbling in non-fiction. I think it all started after I read Cultish by Amanda Montell and realized reading non-fiction didn't have to be a slog.

I love listening to music, and I'd say my tastes vary pretty widely. A quick shuffle of my Spotify yielded me the following:

New Woman ft. Rosalia by Lisa

Got Me Started by Troye Sivan

Heads Will Roll by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

Roman Holiday by Every Time I Die

1gqq5u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gqq5u4/i_figured_out_what_broke_me_and_that_gave_me_the/,I figured out what broke me and that gave me the strength to quit,"Most ppl I've spoken to who've been able to stop the cycle and stick to it will point to something that helped them get there. For some it's AA, maybe a catastrophic or life-threatening event scared them straight, some find their spirituality, some all of the above. For me, it was figuring out what I believe caused my abusive cycle to start in the first place. Let me explain 

I attribute a lot of how I was able to quit and stay off the drink to the book ""Alcohol Explained"". To me, the no-nonsense approach and logical reasoning really resonated... and one part in particular. The author (William Porter) was talking about the body and brain's response to discomfort, specifically due to the effects of drinking too much alcohol (hangover). I'm paraphrasing here, but in so many words he said that when the body is is experiencing pain or discomfort, it's looking for something to lessen the effects. The ""morning after"" for normal drinkers who go out and have a big night once in awhile with friends are generally nursed with gatorade, water, greasy food and naps. I was like this once too. 

Then one morning, after a big night out with some co-workers I was with a  mentor of mine, and we were scheduled on the same flight home so we went for brunch at one of his favorite restaurants before we went to the airport. He was a heavy drinker, and he ordered us both bloody Marys (this place was famous for them apparently) and some water. One of those bloodys  turned into two, then we moved to Irish coffees, and then a beer, and then a few more, and all of a sudden I was feeling WAY better. My headache was gone, I had tons of energy, we were having a great conversation and I wanted to be this guy!

I believe this morning was where I took that dangerous left turn at Albuquerque. To paraphrase Porter again, once the subconscious mind realizes the effects of alcohol can also be cured by more alcohol, a new neural pathway is cut in the brain connecting the pain of a hangover to more alcohol as a fix. So now, rather than vomiting at the sight of an alcoholic drink after a big night out like a casual drinker, I knew subconsciously that it would make me feel better. 

Even at my worst, I was never a ""whiskey in my cheerios"" type of person, I was a high-functioning drinker with a great family, good job, kids, house, etc but my subconscious then knew that, whatever ailed me, a stiff drink was going to make me feel better. After that morning, there was never a time that wasn't a good time for a drink. I already had the ""drink when you're happy"" and ""drink when you're sad"" like most American adults, but now I had ""drink when you're sick because you drank too much"" too. 

For whatever reason, this was the thing I needed to know to keep sober. There wasn't anything wrong with me, I didn't have a ""disease"", maybe I was a bit more prone to addiction bc of ADHD than others, but I wasn't genetically predestined to become a problem drinker at my first sip. Not having the question ""why did this happen to me?"" answered was maddening and depressing and I just couldn't take the idea that it was something I was born with. 

No, I did this to myself. Just like I know one of my legs is slightly longer than the other because I broke it badly when I was a kid, I know that I was the one who caused my own drinking problem. 

I take solace in that.",10,1731538677.0,stopdrinking,0,0.92,False

Innovation propels humanity forward, driving us from our primitive roots to ever more sophisticated heights. Nowhere is this spirit more alive than in the bustling city of Tribade. Here, people dart through crowded streets, racing to their next meeting, pushing to finish the latest project, and tirelessly climbing the corporate ladder. It's a city powered by relentless ambition, its skyline a tribute to modernity.

Yet, just beyond the city, an ancient forest stands as a silent contrast—a wild testament to a world untouched by progress. Towering trees and rugged mountains hold memories of older ways, grounding the landscape in traditions that refuse to fade.

At the border where forest meets city, lies a small sanctuary: the Hug in a Mug coffee shop. Though tucked away in this liminal space—not quite city, not quite forest—the cozy café is always busy. Maybe it's the charm of the baristas, maybe the coffee really is that good, or maybe... there’s something magical about the place. Perhaps it’s a bit of everything.

In this world, you are an employee at Hug in a Mug.

* Embark on a journey to uncover hidden mysteries that stretch between city and forest.

* Confront a new, mounting threat: someone—or something—is targeting the shop, with consequences that could change the world forever if they aren’t stopped.

* And, of course, along the way, you’ll have the chance to flirt with some very cute women.

Will you keep Hug in a Mug safe, unravel its secrets, and find a place where magic and innovation can coexist?

First, I must clarify: he isn't my boyfriend anymore. We broke up around three months ago, and after randomly talking again, we have been trying to figure out if we could give it another try.

Because of this, we're spending a lot of time and effort talking not just about us, but about unresolved issues, old fights, etc. To make this post easier to understand, I'll just call him my boyfriend.

I'm generally not the type to delete pics/posts online after a relationship. My ex and I were together for 9 months (after almost a year of having a crush on each other) in 2020 and the breakup was tough. I even talked about it on here, it took me years to fully be open and emotionally available to date someone.

My boyfriend has seen all the posts and TikToks about him, especially the ones after the breakup. I've never hidden anything, I don't have any reason to.

Today, during one of our conversations, he asked me if I would give said ex another chance, and he asked me to be brutally honest because, he admitted, the way I used to talk about him and even the few occasions I mentioned him more recently make him insecure about us.

I replied that yes, I would. I thought he was the man of my life and we were even planning on moving in together when we broke up. I repeated (because we had a similar conversation when we started dating) that I still love my ex, but in a platonic way, and I would never talk ill of him. I don't have any contact with him, and I don't even know where he is or what he's doing, I wouldn't text him ever, but if it randomly happened and I was single and interested, I would go out with him, see who he became and if we could work.

My boyfriend went quiet and told me that it makes him think we can't work it out because he sees it almost as emotional cheating.

While I understand that it might be hurtful to hear, I was being honest and did my best to explain that in this scenario, he wouldn't be in the picture. Going out with my ex would mean I would be single and not into my boyfriend anymore. If my ex came back now, I would reject him.

So, am I the asshole? Should I have ""lied"" to not make him overthink?

  
EDIT: (wrote this is a comment but I'll also paste it here) Just to clarify: I don't talk about my ex often, like at all. We talked directly about my ex twice: the first one when we talked about our last relationship (and while I've dated after my ex, my bf is the first after him), and the second when, while playing online with a friend of mine, he invited my ex to the lobby (he didn't know, long story). I kicked him because I thought it was disrespectful to have him in there.

I actually met my ex last year (2023) in October (a week after that I met my boyfriend, to set the timeline), we went out for a coffee because he was in my town for work and I didn't feel anything for him, it was like talking to an old friend. He felt different from when we were together (obviously) and it ended there. He sent me a text later to ask if I got home safe, I replied and we never spoke again. My boyfriend knows this too.

It is my fault if in the post it comes across as me pestering him about my ex, and I apologize for that",0,1731538382.0,AmItheAsshole,35,0.31,False

1gqq00b,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gqq00b/enhancing_time_management_journaling_with_ai_a/,Enhancing Time Management & Journaling with AI: A Hybrid Physical-Digital Approach,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience combining AI, physical journaling, and time tracking - and get your thoughts on taking this further.

**Background: My AI-Enhanced Productivity Journey**

I recently did an intensive [experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1gq5jdb/how_im_using_ai_to_track_my_time_and_boost/) tracking my time down to the minute (as a software engineer juggling multiple projects, Kendo practice, and side hustles). I used Claude/ChatGPT to analyze my patterns and got some fascinating insights about my productivity and habits. The AIs helped me spot patterns I was blind to and asked surprisingly thoughtful questions that made me reflect deeper.

What really struck me was how AI turned from just an analysis tool into something like a wise friend who remembers everything and asks the right questions at the right time. This got me thinking about creating a more structured approach.

**The Hybrid Model Concept**

I'm exploring an idea that combines:

1. Physical journaling/tracking (for tactile experience and mindfulness)

2. AI-powered digital companion (for insights and reflection)

3. Flexible input methods (write in a notebook, take photos, type, or voice record)

The key insight is: while AI can track digital activities, our lives happen both online and offline. Sometimes we're in meetings, reading books, or having coffee with friends. By combining human input with AI analysis, we get both accuracy and insight.

**How It Would Work:**

\- Write in your physical journal/planner as usual

\- Optionally snap photos or type key points into the app

\- AI companion provides:

 \- Smart comparisons (today vs last week/month/year)

 \- Pattern recognition (""I notice you're most creative after morning exercise..."")

 \- Thoughtful reflection prompts (""How has your approach to \[recurring challenge\] evolved?"")

 \- Connection-making between entries (""This reminds me of what you wrote about..."")

**What Makes This Different**

1. Human Agency: You control what to track and share, maintaining mindfulness

2. AI as Coach: Beyond just tracking, it asks meaningful questions based on your patterns

3. Temporal Intelligence: Helps you see how your behaviors and thoughts evolve over time

4. Flexibility: Works whether you prefer paper, digital, or both

**Early Insights from My Testing:**

\- Initial tracking caused some anxiety (couldn't sleep first two nights!) but became natural

\- AI feedback varies by tool (Claude more encouraging, ChatGPT more direct)

\- The combination of manual tracking + AI analysis led to better self-awareness

\- Having AI ask unexpected questions led to deeper insights than solo journaling

**Questions for the Community:**

1. Have you tried combining AI with traditional productivity/journaling methods? What worked/didn't?

2. What kinds of AI-generated insights/questions would be most valuable to you?

3. How would you balance the convenience of automation with the benefits of manual tracking?

4. What features would make this truly useful for your productivity practice?

I believe there's something powerful in combining the mindfulness of manual tracking, the wisdom of AI, and the flexibility of modern tools. But I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

Looking forward to the discussion! 🤔✍️",0,1731538242.0,SideProject,0,0.5,False
1gqq004,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gqq004/can_an_air_fryer_replace_a_microwave/,Can An Air Fryer Replace A Microwave?,"Hey there! I've been using my air fryer for about a year now, and I can't tell you how many times people have asked me if they should ditch their microwave for an air fryer. So, I thought I'd share my honest experience and help you make that decision.

First off, let's be real - air fryers and microwaves are totally different beasts. While microwaves use radiation to heat your food quickly, air fryers work more like mini convection ovens, circulating hot air around your food. This difference is crucial when deciding if you can actually replace one with the other.

Here's what my air fryer absolutely crushes:
- Getting food crispy (those leftover fries? Better than fresh!)
- Cooking meats to perfection
- Roasting vegetables
- Making frozen foods taste oven-baked
- Reheating pizza (game-changer!)

If you're interested in checking out some great options, I've found some really good deals here: https://athometouch.com/airfryer

But here's where microwaves still win:
- Speed (nothing beats 2-minute reheating)
- Heating liquids (soups, coffee)
- Defrosting in a pinch
- Making popcorn
- Warming up things like rice or pasta

The truth is, I still use both. My air fryer has definitely reduced my microwave use by about 70%, but I wouldn't get rid of my microwave completely. The air fryer gives me better-tasting food, but sometimes I just need that quick zap that only a microwave can provide.

If you're tight on counter space and have to choose one, think about your cooking habits. Do you prioritize taste and texture, or is quick heating more important? If you're leaning towards better taste and don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, definitely go for an air fryer. You can find some really good ones here: https://athometouch.com/airfryer

My personal setup has both because they each serve different purposes in my kitchen. The air fryer has revolutionized how I cook and reheat food, making everything taste better, while the microwave handles the quick stuff when I'm in a rush.

Bottom line: An air fryer probably can't completely replace your microwave, but it might make you use it a lot less. And honestly? Your taste buds will thank you for it.

I'd love to hear about your experiences with air fryers or any questions you might have about making the switch. Drop your thoughts below!",1,1731538242.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
