1qwe647,https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor,A lightweight and modern text editor Mac OS App built for speed and simplicity based on SwiftUI,"Hey everyone,

Built by a human. AI tools used selectively for ideation and assets.

I’m a Data Scientist working in enterprise IT (mostly Python/Cloud infra). Like many of you, I spend half my life in VS Code or JetBrains IDEs. They are powerful, but they are also heavy.

Sometimes I just need to quickly tweak a Python script, check a JSON config, or review a README without launching a browser instance wrapped in a desktop app or waiting for an indexing process to finish. I wanted something that felt like a native citizen of macOS—fast, lightweight, and respectful of my battery life—but still had modern syntax highlighting.

So, I created Neon Vision Editor with Swift UI.

It’s an alpha release, written purely in Swift and AppKit. No Electron, no cross-platform abstraction layers, no telemetry. Just a text editor that opens instantly and lets you work.What it is:

Native & Fast: Built for macOS 26 (Tahoe) using Apple Silicon.

Zero Bloat: No project management, no plugins, no background indexing.

Update: Readable: High-contrast syntax highlighting for swift, python, javascript, typescript, java, kotlin, go, ruby, rust, sql, html, css, c, cpp, objective-c, json, xml, yaml, toml, ini, markdown, bash, zsh, powershell, plain

Syntax highlighting is being automatically applied to an opened file or pasted content.

Privacy-First: It doesn’t phone home.

Includes AI features for the use of Apple foundation model (and others) for syntax suggestions and some simple code completion (currently not functional yet).

Why I built it:

In my day job handling it infrastructure and migrations, complexity is the enemy. I wanted a tool that does one thing well: edits text. I don’t need my text editor to play music or brew coffee; I just need it to open a 10MB log file without choking.

Current Status:

It’s currently in v0.2.7-alpha. It’s stable enough for daily use (I use it for all my quick edits), but it is a work in progress.

Where to get it: You can grab the build from GitHub Releases:

https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor

I’d love to hear what you think. I’m specifically looking for feedback on load times with large files and how the syntax highlighting feels to other developers.

1qwe2bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qwe2bh/fasting_diet_advice_and_maybe_advice_on/,Fasting diet advice? And maybe advice on approaching long term fasts?,"I understand that fasting is achieved by consuming no or a minimal amount of food and liquids for periods of time.

My longest fast was eight days. I drank small amounts of water everyday. Like, a glass and a half or less. I stopped consuming entertainmenent and just sat around, fed my pets everyday, made food for my mom somedays. I was just stuck pondering. It was painful, spiritually and mentally. because I felt dead. I enjoyed caring. Because there is a definition to character by choice to starve while feeding my family and my dogs.

That was about two years ago.

This time I plan to fast for at least three days, but I plan to consume a lot of water. And a teaspoon of coconut oil every day or other day. If I feel well, then I will continue. I want to go longer for five days. My goal is a lot lower because Ive been eating rather well, so I don't want to shock my body.

My fast from two years ago had weeks of preparation, by lowering amounts of food incrementally. Going two or three days at a time without food, then making the leap to eight days.

Tmi; I talk about losing bowel control.

I'm not sure how people go for two weeks. I loss bowel control on the 8th day and literally deficated my pants with shedded intenstinal lining. Which scared me, so I slowly started eating again. I remember the meal. It was delicious. One small cutie orange, then another. Then hours later an apple. Next day was rice veggie mix in low amounts. Because my fast ended in the afternoon. It was really enjoyable to end it.


To clarify, I would like advice on if this counts as a fast if I'm consuming small amounts of coconut oil a day? if I drink at most, one cup of coffee a day? Is there maybe a kind of tea or liquid to consider drinking for benefits?

Also, what approaches exist for long term fasts?

Any general advice for fasting, maintaining fasting is appreciated.

My fasts before were strict to having little to no water. But I'm recognizing that longer fasts require a different approach. So I prepared by gaining some twenty-thirty pounds since my last fast. I'm at 180lb now. I was bouncing between 140-160 two years ago.

This fast is purposed with expressing love towards God. ",1,1770273629.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

	•	Loud, plane-like noise in an otherwise very quiet court.

	•	Torch lights shone at my front door from a distance while leaving home.

Mental state insight

	•	I am aware this all sounds like psychosis.

	•	I am still able to:

	•	Question my own interpretations.

	•	Perform process-of-elimination thinking.

	•	Consider alternative explanations (animals, light refraction, tech glitches).

	•	This self-awareness makes me unsure whether this is:

	•	Substance-induced psychosis,

	•	A medical issue (e.g., carbon monoxide exposure, sleep disorder),

	•	Trauma-related hypervigilance,

	•	Or genuine stalking.

What I’m asking Reddit users… 

	•	Does this presentation align more with:

	•	Meth-induced psychosis (despite late onset)?

	•	Carbon monoxide or other environmental poisoning?

	•	Severe sleep deprivation or trauma response?

	•	Or stalking that I can’t yet prove?

So I work in a semi-professional/professional setting and recently I got promoted and moved up to our third floor. After coming up I noticed that somebody wasn’t flushing the toilet properly in the ladies restroom. This wasn’t just in occasional instance. It was every day. Now at first I thought the toilet was just not working, so I put it in an a maintenance ticket. The toilet was fine. A week goes by without any incident. Nothing in the toilet. No toilet paper in sight, all was good. Then one day after a huge cup of coffee, I went to the restroom. There in the first stall toilet…. Was somebodies fecal matter. Now this wasn’t even attempted to be flushed. It was just there… like someone had just went, wiped, got up and left. Lord knows if they washed their hands. Of course I took it to my Manager for attention, and I was told that they would look into it. Nothing. It’s been a year and I’ve spoken about it several times, put up signs in the stalls and on the door before you leave out, sent a mass email to the women of the company and cc’d my female managers. There have been many chats and still EVERY SINGLE WEEK, there is still shit in the toilet. 

Am I wrong to think this is intentional? To be this upset about it???

My partner and I have been together for almost two years. We are both in our 30s. When we decided to move together we chose a property somewhat accessible for the both of us in regards to the commute to work, although I have always felt that since he has a car it was more comfortable for him. I, on the other hand, had to take about three different public transportation means to get to work. 

All in all, we would both get to work in under one hour which felt fine so I agreed to it.

We signed the lease, all good until my busses started having massive almost daily delays. I then decided to switch to having an electric scooter to not depend so much on public transport. The problem was that one day, 6 months into the commute, I had a pretty bad accident during the commute, fell off the scooter and messed up my dominant arm for a good portion of the next three months. The accident kind of racked me mentally.

I started seeing the ugliness of our new neighbourhood. How empty it is, how dark at night, how there are no coffee shops, restaurants, museums etc nowhere within the range of an hour. I miss my old place that was in the city and above all I became resentful of my partner who doesn’t understand that I feel like I could have been injured worse during my accident and even died if the hit would have been more fatal. I told him this commute is starting to feel like a threat to my safety and sanity.

But he is unhappy about moving again and moving closer to the city. Although he somewhat agreed to start looking together next year, I see how unhappy he is. It will add an extra 20 mins to his commute and he feels that we put too much effort moving now to move again so soon and although I agree, I cannot help to feel my mental health eroding, the tears I am fighting daily due to the pain in my arm, the physical therapies I will have to follow for months to regain mobility… All this make me resentful of him. In my eyes, someone who loved me would up and move tomorrow after what happened.

So what is the consensus? Is this my fault for pushing a sudden move? Should my partner be more understanding? Thanks.",2,1770273396.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

We got really close since we're involved in the same clubs and courses. When I initially met her, she was having friendship problems with her other friends. Naturally we started hanging out more and that was how we became close within two years.

Lately, I've been keeping my distance. She went through a lot this past year so I've been giving her grace. When she goes through a rough patch, she gets distant. We had that in common so I made sure to check in and initiate plans. But now that I'm going though a lot, she's hasn't reached out. I feel like she's not showing up when I need a friend, especially now that things are going well with her other friends. 

Speaking of her friends, this one time we all got together and her friends kept turning their back towards me and excluding me. It was weird and I told her that next time I won't be going to a group event with them. She understood and agreed they were being rude. As time went on and their problems seemed to resolve, I invited her for coffee and she invited her friends to join without telling me. After that happened, I clarified that I invited her, not her friends, because I needed to talk through some personal things. She got upset. She also got upset because she wanted to travel with me and her friend group together. I made it clear that I want to travel with her, but that I'm not interested in traveling with her friends since they've been rude to me. I then made it clear I didn't like them. That upset her. She's brought up this conversation multiple times hoping I would change my mind. 

It's been 3 months since I've kept distance. I've come to realize how negative she was, how much she would belittle me, and would just talk bad about everyone, including her friends she's always having problems with. It wouldn't surprise me if she talks bad about me at this point. Maybe that's why her friends are weird towards me. This might sound horrible, but I'm at peace without her presence. The friendship is too one sided and draining at this point.

The problem is, how can I tell her I'm no longer interested in being her friend? We're supposed to study abroad together during our last semester and are going to work at the same company after graduation. I did change my flight seats to continue to keep my distance. We're working for a big company so I'm sure we'll work in different departments. I tend to be confrontational, but the last time I confronted her with an issue, she got rude and defensive. And based on the boundaries I've set, it seems that she doesn't respect them. I didn't want problems, I just think it's important to clearly end a friendship that's associated with my professional life rather than ghosting.

A brief summary of this firmware's capabilities:

* Standard USB audio device with plug-and-play compatibility under Windows, macOS and Linux.
* 44.1KHz and 48KHz sample rate support.
* 32-bit float audio pipeline with 64-bit internal for the RP2350 (32-bit fixed point for the RP2040)
* 5 logical audio channels - 2 Master Inputs, 2 Main Outputs and 1 Subwoofer Output.
* Parametric EQ with up to 50 slots available (10 per channel).
* Per-channel gain, mute and delay controls.
* S/PDIF output to enable the use of any fancy DAC.
* Clean analog mono subwoofer output that enables direct active subwoofer connection without the need for a second DAC.

I also had my fallopian tubes removed at the age of 35 and I'm sure I read correctly that it affects ovarian blood supply and causes hormones to flucuate?

I stated in Monday morning at 1 pump. It's now Thursday morning (6 am). I have yet to take my 1 pump as I take it around 07:30am. It's says to take 1 or 2 pumps. I was advised 1 pump for now.

I am normally bed ridden with fatigue on my bleed. I collapse so to speak. I was looking forward to feeling super calm though as the PMDD can be awful.

It's a very weird to feeling like the calm or fatigue hasn't arrived and instead feel completely wired and my sleep is getting lighter. (I suffer with insomnia so I look forward to sleep on my bleeds even though I can get very hot at night). I also take 25mg of quetiapine to help my moods and sleep as I'm integrating alot of trauma.

I have also been prescribed 100mg of micronised progesterone to take twice daily at night for 2 weeks on then 2 weeks off which I shall start the Monday after next.

I'll take my next dose this morning in about 2 hours.

Should I reduce to 1/2 a pump to slow it down? I am very sensitive to medication.

Does this get better with time and with taking progesterone?

We love coffee shops, good food, local shops, matcha, pokemon, playgrounds for the kids

We have 3 nights and don’t know where we can stop in between Tokyo and Kyoto that is not out of the way And with fun things do to with the toddlers. We can skip hakone too and do a full 6 nights somewhere. Did not add Lake Kawaguchi because there will be too much traveling with the kids And not Osaka because we didn’t like it as Much as the other cities.

\- 3 nights Hakone

Wahu Apartments  
  
Hello! I’m looking for someone to take over the last few months of my lease, it's a 2x2 (2 bed 2 bath) apartment at Wahu for the end of the Spring semester into the summer, from **May 1st to July 31st or June 1st-July 31st,** whichever works better. Details:

\- All genders welcome, roommate is male and super chill. He might not be here a lot during the summer semester so you might be alone most of the time which is a bonus.

\- Rent is normally $979 but this unit gets $150 off per month on rent, so actual rent is $829/month, not including utilities (am willing to negotiate more)

\- You’ll have your own bedroom and bathroom (bigger bedroom and bathroom of the 2x2)

\- Internet is free, but you’ll be responsible for other utilities (gas, electricity, water, etc.)

\- Parking passes must be purchased separately

\- Includes many amenities: Gym, pool, pool table, study lounges, printing/computer area, coffee machines, etc.

\- Super convenient location! 3-5 minute walk to campus, light rail, amazing food options",1,1770271782.0,uofmn,0,1.0,False

Let me tell you why.","When you start fallout 4, you create your character then head into the kitchen/living area where the handy robot has a coffee for you and you drink it then sit down and watch TV which has the news station channel on; forecasting the weather that there are unusually high temps in the east and west, then the robot says ""looks like shaun made a stinky!"", in other words, he just dropped a bomb, this is when the vault tec guy comes to the door to sign you up for the vaults, which would take about 4 minutes, then when you finish up, the robot says shaun needs your maternal affection so you head on into shauns room and check in on him, and time passes for what seems like a minute or so, then the robot is telling you that you should check the news on TV, which is when they announce that bombs were dropped. God dammit shaun! 

So you run to the bunker which is about another 2 minutes, just as you get to the elevator platform, another bomb was dropped nearby, if you count the minutes from the time shaun made a stinky, to the time you arrived at the elevator platform, it adds to about 7 minutes, which is well enough time for a bomb to be dropped. 

So this is my theory, the only question im left wondering is, did shaun himself, launch the bombs from being stinky, or did the Chinese/Vault Tec drop the bombs to counteract shauns stinky?

“It’s not bad for a land-locked state.” she said, placing dirtied chopsticks on the brim of her plate.

“I hate it.” said the brunette across from her. 

This October 19th was her golden birthday, and dragging Maya to all-you-can-eat sushi made her feel whole. For a moment there wasn’t any shouting or twisted faces. Amelia could speak freely without having to tiptoe across eggshells. No simple comments or suggestions were met with “quit kissing my ass” or “stop saying shit like that.”

“Well thank you for at least trying.” Amelia replied. 

Maya gave a moment of thought, “it’s really not that bad, I just can’t get over the fact that it’s raw fish.”

“I thought you didn’t have a problem with raw?” Amelia chuckled, looking up from emptying the last of the soy sauce into her dish.

Maya sat up and hazily stared to the side, “okay, shut the fuck up.”

Amelia let a heavy smirk spread across her lips and shrugged, “just say you love him.”

“I don’t.”

“You’re a liar.”

Maya shook her head, “you’re annoying.”

The waitress approached their booth and replaced the soy sauce. Her navy blue dress hugged her sides unapologetically and her makeup caked her crow’s feet. “How was everything?”

“Really good.” Maya said as both girls nodded.

“Excellent.” the waitress said as she placed the check onto the table, “no rush.” She then did a small bow and darted from the booth. 

Just as she turned Amelia gave her a hurried “you look pretty today.” The waitress whipped around quickly showing a blushing smile with a breathy laugh. She bowed once more and gave a small nervous wave, then rushed off again. 

“Pretty might be a bit strong.” Maya said in a low voice as she pulled out her wallet.

Amelia hastily searched for her own credit card. “She tried. Also, you don’t have to pay.”

“Shut up bitch, it’s your birthday.” 

The girls walked out through glass doors and onto a sidewalk littered with men and women in suits. Stop and go traffic filled the street and the air crowded itself with car horns and smog. Large advertisements coated skyscrapers and steam rose from manhole covers. 

A man walked past them talking on a cell phone while texting on another. A woman with bleach blonde hair stunted by in click-clacking heels, accompanied by a small white dog. In front of them an older couple in matching sweaters paid their parking meter.

“How cute.” Amelia said, admiring the duo.

Maya stripped her gaze from the silver Aston Martin passing by, “gross.”

They walked west behind a group of women, all sporting pantsuits and iced coffees. Just between two tall buildings, Amelia could catch a glimpse of the far away Rockies. “So much different than Gunnison.”

Maya spread her arms wide and took in a panoramic of the chaos around her, “and when we’re rich and famous we’ll never have to go back.” 

Amelia rolled her eyes just as a car slammed into a light pole across the street. The sound of crushing metal lightly hushed the crowd around them and several cars hit their breaks, putting screeching skid marks on the pavement. 

“Oh my god.” Maya said, covering her mouth. 

Steam began to rise from the red minivan’s hood. The herd of people on the sidewalk nearby then started to divide. Most pushed along, turning their attention forward and continuing their business calls. Others rushed over, looking inside the vehicle’s windows. 

Maya rushed across the street that now held standstill traffic. In high school her mother forced her into an Emergency Technician class, hoping her daughter would follow in her nursing footsteps. Instead, Maya loved cosmetology and Bryan Sterling, so nursing school never came. Still, she had learned a thing or two in the course.

She joined two men that attempted to open the passenger side door but with no success. When Maya reached the window with a balled fist she paused once catching sight of the driver.

The woman behind the wheel sat arching upward, her chest pressed to the car’s ceiling. The blue jeans that sat tight against her thighs brushed against the steering wheel as she shook violently from side to side. Her head dangled limply from her neck, revealing white spheres in her eye sockets. Drool began to fall out the side of her mouth and her arms failed about behind her.

Maya stepped back, mouth agape. She turned to the street in which she came from, “Amelia, call 911.” But as she spoke her breath escaped her.

Men and women rushed down the sidewalk. Others stood still in horror. Coffees and nicotine vapes fell to the concrete and mouths fell open. Slowly rising several feet above the ground, Amelia hung in the air. 

The veins in her neck bulged violently underneath her skin. Her body dangled above the crowd’s heads like a cheap toy from a claw machine. Her eyes showed white and her jaw swung loosely from her cranium. Her purse fell to the pavement, scattering makeup and loose jewelry. 

Maya shrieked, hurting the inside of her throat. As she stepped across the road covered with drivers in disbelief, a figure caught her peripheral.

They walked west behind a group of women, all sporting pantsuits and iced coffees. Just between two tall buildings, Amelia could catch a glimpse of the far away Rockies. “So much different than Gunnison.”

Maya spread her arms wide and took in a panoramic of the chaos around her, “and when we’re rich and famous we’ll never have to go back.” 

Amelia rolled her eyes just as a car slammed into a light pole across the street. The sound of crushing metal lightly hushed the crowd around them and several cars hit their breaks, putting screeching skid marks on the pavement. 

“Oh my god.” Maya said, covering her mouth. 

Steam began to rise from the red minivan’s hood. The herd of people on the sidewalk nearby then started to divide. Most pushed along, turning their attention forward and continuing their business calls. Others rushed over, looking inside the vehicle’s windows. 

Maya rushed across the street that now held standstill traffic. In high school her mother forced her into an Emergency Technician class, hoping her daughter would follow in her nursing footsteps. Instead, Maya loved cosmetology and Bryan Sterling, so nursing school never came. Still, she had learned a thing or two in the course.

She joined two men that attempted to open the passenger side door but with no success. When Maya reached the window with a balled fist she paused once catching sight of the driver.

The woman behind the wheel sat arching upward, her chest pressed to the car’s ceiling. The blue jeans that sat tight against her thighs brushed against the steering wheel as she shook violently from side to side. Her head dangled limply from her neck, revealing white spheres in her eye sockets. Drool began to fall out the side of her mouth and her arms failed about behind her.

Maya stepped back, mouth agape. She turned to the street in which she came from, “Amelia, call 911.” But as she spoke her breath escaped her.

Men and women rushed down the sidewalk. Others stood still in horror. Coffees and nicotine vapes fell to the concrete and mouths fell open. Slowly rising several feet above the ground, Amelia hung in the air. 

The veins in her neck bulged violently underneath her skin. Her body dangled above the crowd’s heads like a cheap toy from a claw machine. Her eyes showed white and her jaw swung loosely from her cranium. Her purse fell to the pavement, scattering makeup and loose jewelry. 

Maya shrieked, hurting the inside of her throat. As she stepped across the road covered with drivers in disbelief, a figure caught her peripheral.

“Well thank you for at least trying.” Amelia replied. 

Maya gave a moment of thought, “it’s really not that bad, I just can’t get over the fact that it’s raw fish.”

“I thought you didn’t have a problem with raw?” Amelia chuckled, looking up from emptying the last of the soy sauce into her dish.

Maya sat up and hazily stared to the side, “okay, shut the fuck up.”

Amelia let a heavy smirk spread across her lips and shrugged, “just say you love him.”

“I don’t.”

“You’re a liar.”

Maya shook her head, “you’re annoying.”

The waitress approached their booth and replaced the soy sauce. Her navy blue dress hugged her sides unapologetically and her makeup caked her crow’s feet. “How was everything?”

“Really good.” Maya said as both girls nodded.

“Excellent.” the waitress said as she placed the check onto the table, “no rush.” She then did a small bow and darted from the booth. 

Just as she turned Amelia gave her a hurried “you look pretty today.” The waitress whipped around quickly showing a blushing smile with a breathy laugh. She bowed once more and gave a small nervous wave, then rushed off again. 

“Pretty might be a bit strong.” Maya said in a low voice as she pulled out her wallet.

Amelia hastily searched for her own credit card. “She tried. Also, you don’t have to pay.”

“Shut up bitch, it’s your birthday.” 

The girls walked out through glass doors and onto a sidewalk littered with men and women in suits. Stop and go traffic filled the street and the air crowded itself with car horns and smog. Large advertisements coated skyscrapers and steam rose from manhole covers.

The franchise business has become one of the most profitable ventures for emerging entrepreneurs in India. As the country's economy expands with rising consumer spending, franchise investment has emerged as a favorable avenue for business ownership. However, franchise selection is a complex process that requires careful consideration, thorough research, and strategic planning. It is an all-inclusive manual on investing in franchising in India.

# Knowledge Franchise Investment.

Investment in franchising entails the acquisition of rights to operate a business under a pre-existing name and business model, which is operated under an established brand name. This structure enables you to enjoy the proven systems, brand name, and support of the franchisor when operating your business. The investment encompasses franchise fees, establishment charges, working capital, and royalty payments.

# Before investing in franchising, several significant factors should be considered.

**1. Determine Your Financing and Financial Strength.**

Be honest with yourself before investing in franchising. Look not only at the first franchise fee but also at set-up, inventory, equipment, real estate, staffing, and operating expenses for at least the first six months. The investments per franchise in India range from 5 lakhs to some crores, depending on the brand and industry.

**2. Investigate the Reputation of the Brand.**

A franchise investment greatly relies on the brand you invest in—a study of the franchisor's history, market, and reputation. Identify the brands that have been gradually gaining momentum, those with positive user reviews and support. Visit the existing franchise locations, meet the existing franchisees, research their experiences, and then make your choice.

**3. Evaluate Market Demand**

Knowing the market demand in the area where you plan to invest in franchises is essential. Examine the demographics, tastes, and preferences of your local market, competitors, and economic environment. A franchise that performs well in urban areas may fail in the small towns, and vice versa. Make sure the products or services you plan to provide have sufficient demand and supply.

**4. Know the Franchise Agreement.**

The franchise agreement is a legally binding document that sets out your rights and obligations under franchise contracts. Before making a serious investment, review the agreement with a legal expert. Be mindful of the rights associated with the territory, renewal, exit, royalty, and the provisions made by the franchisor regarding their support.

# India has popular franchise sectors.

**Food and Beverage**

The F&B sector remains the most sought-after for franchising in India. From fast food restaurants to specialty coffee outlets, the industry offers a wide range of opportunities at varying levels of investment. Brands such as Domino's, Subway, and Chai Point have built successful franchise networks.

**Education and Training**

As India places a lot of value on education, tutoring, skill development, and preschools, franchises have grown exponentially. It is an industry that can be a middle-range franchise investment, with moderate returns and high social good.

**Retail and E-commerce**

A retail franchisee offering fashion, electronics, groceries, and specialty products has continued to appeal to investors. The merger of online and offline has created new opportunities for investing in franchises in this field.

**Health and Fitness**

**Conduct Due Diligence**

Franchise investment should never be rushed. Order the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD), which includes key details about the franchise system, such as its financial performance, litigation history, and franchisee obligations. Confirm everything by yourself.

**Determine Return on Investment.**

Develop attainable financial forecasts using real performance data from current franchises. Include such factors as break-even time, profit margins, and growth potential. A sensible franchise investment must pay reasonable returns in 2-4 years.

**Assess Training and Support.**

Close franchisor help is key to success. Evaluate the standards of initial training, continuous support, marketing, and operational support. Comprehensive support systems are the best franchise investment opportunities.

**Reflect on Your Competency and the Interests.**

Select a franchise based on interests, skills, and background. Your interest and knowledge in a specific area will significantly influence the success of your franchise investment.

# Red Flags to Avoid

Watch out for franchises which:

* Make unrealistic promises on profits.
* Forced to make fast judgments.
* Experience high turnover rates of franchisees.
* Weaknesses in financial reporting.
* Provide support for training.

1qwd0xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qwd0xt/the_ferry_pt1amelia/,The Ferry: Pt.1-Amelia,"Most birthdays are dreadful in the Morris household. Lillian, mother of three, has never failed to make a scene on all her daughters date of birth. Most birthdays feature a kitchen screaming match, embarrassing the waiter or a trip to the emergency room. After last year’s debacle of burning birthday presents in the backyard, Amelia had finally had enough. 

“It’s not bad for a land-locked state.” she said, placing dirtied chopsticks on the brim of her plate.

“I hate it.” said the brunette across from her. 

This October 19th was her golden birthday, and dragging Maya to all-you-can-eat sushi made her feel whole. For a moment there wasn’t any shouting or twisted faces. Amelia could speak freely without having to tiptoe across eggshells. No simple comments or suggestions were met with “quit kissing my ass” or “stop saying shit like that.”

“Well thank you for at least trying.” Amelia replied. 

Maya gave a moment of thought, “it’s really not that bad, I just can’t get over the fact that it’s raw fish.”

“I thought you didn’t have a problem with raw?” Amelia chuckled, looking up from emptying the last of the soy sauce into her dish.

Maya sat up and hazily stared to the side, “okay, shut the fuck up.”

Amelia let a heavy smirk spread across her lips and shrugged, “just say you love him.”

“I don’t.”

“You’re a liar.”

Maya shook her head, “you’re annoying.”

The waitress approached their booth and replaced the soy sauce. Her navy blue dress hugged her sides unapologetically and her makeup caked her crow’s feet. “How was everything?”

“Really good.” Maya said as both girls nodded.

“Excellent.” the waitress said as she placed the check onto the table, “no rush.” She then did a small bow and darted from the booth. 

Just as she turned Amelia gave her a hurried “you look pretty today.” The waitress whipped around quickly showing a blushing smile with a breathy laugh. She bowed once more and gave a small nervous wave, then rushed off again. 

“Pretty might be a bit strong.” Maya said in a low voice as she pulled out her wallet.

Amelia hastily searched for her own credit card. “She tried. Also, you don’t have to pay.”

“Shut up bitch, it’s your birthday.” 



The girls walked out through glass doors and onto a sidewalk littered with men and women in suits. Stop and go traffic filled the street and the air crowded itself with car horns and smog. Large advertisements coated skyscrapers and steam rose from manhole covers. 

A man walked past them talking on a cell phone while texting on another. A woman with bleach blonde hair stunted by in click-clacking heels, accompanied by a small white dog. In front of them an older couple in matching sweaters paid their parking meter.

“How cute.” Amelia said, admiring the duo.

Maya stripped her gaze from the silver Aston Martin passing by, “gross.”

They walked west behind a group of women, all sporting pantsuits and iced coffees. Just between two tall buildings, Amelia could catch a glimpse of the far away Rockies. “So much different than Gunnison.”

Maya spread her arms wide and took in a panoramic of the chaos around her, “and when we’re rich and famous we’ll never have to go back.” 

Amelia rolled her eyes just as a car slammed into a light pole across the street. The sound of crushing metal lightly hushed the crowd around them and several cars hit their breaks, putting screeching skid marks on the pavement. 

“Oh my god.” Maya said, covering her mouth. 

Steam began to rise from the red minivan’s hood. The herd of people on the sidewalk nearby then started to divide. Most pushed along, turning their attention forward and continuing their business calls. Others rushed over, looking inside the vehicle’s windows. 

Maya rushed across the street that now held standstill traffic. In high school her mother forced her into an Emergency Technician class, hoping her daughter would follow in her nursing footsteps. Instead, Maya loved cosmetology and Bryan Sterling, so nursing school never came. Still, she had learned a thing or two in the course.

She joined two men that attempted to open the passenger side door but with no success. When Maya reached the window with a balled fist she paused once catching sight of the driver.

The woman behind the wheel sat arching upward, her chest pressed to the car’s ceiling. The blue jeans that sat tight against her thighs brushed against the steering wheel as she shook violently from side to side. Her head dangled limply from her neck, revealing white spheres in her eye sockets. Drool began to fall out the side of her mouth and her arms failed about behind her.

Maya stepped back, mouth agape. She turned to the street in which she came from, “Amelia, call 911.” But as she spoke her breath escaped her.

Men and women rushed down the sidewalk. Others stood still in horror. Coffees and nicotine vapes fell to the concrete and mouths fell open. Slowly rising several feet above the ground, Amelia hung in the air. 

The veins in her neck bulged violently underneath her skin. Her body dangled above the crowd’s heads like a cheap toy from a claw machine. Her eyes showed white and her jaw swung loosely from her cranium. Her purse fell to the pavement, scattering makeup and loose jewelry. 

Maya shrieked, hurting the inside of her throat. As she stepped across the road covered with drivers in disbelief, a figure caught her peripheral.

Just down the street, the silhouette of a man rose from the ground.",1,1770270260.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Wahu Apartments

Hello! I’m looking for someone to take over the last few months of my lease, it's a 2x2 (2 bed 2 bath) apartment at Wahu for the end of the Spring semester into the summer, from **May 1st to July 31st or June 1st-July 31st,** whichever works better. Details:

\- All genders welcome, roommate is male and super chill. He might not be here a lot during the summer semester so you might be alone most of the time which is a bonus.

\- Rent is normally $979 but this unit gets $150 off per month on rent, so actual rent is $829/month, not including utilities (am willing to negotiate more)

\- You’ll have your own bedroom and bathroom (bigger bedroom and bathroom of the 2x2)

\- Internet is free, but you’ll be responsible for other utilities (gas, electricity, water, etc.)

\- Parking passes must be purchased separately

\- Includes many amenities: Gym, pool, pool table, study lounges, printing/computer area, coffee machines, etc.

\- Super convenient location! 3-5 minute walk to campus, light rail, amazing food options!

Read every book, watched every interview, dissected their strategies. The pattern is wild. These aren't tech geniuses or trust fund kids. They're regular people who figured out something most of us miss completely. We're taught to climb ladders, join companies, trade time for money. Meanwhile someone's making your yearly salary from their laptop at a coffee shop. And they're not working 80 hour weeks either. This isn't another ""passive income"" fantasy post. This is about the actual mechanics of turning yourself into a profitable business.

The concept is simple but most people fuck it up. You take your knowledge, package it in a way that scales, and sell it repeatedly. Your employer does this with your labor already. You just cut out the middleman. The beauty is you don't need some revolutionary idea. You need expertise in something people want to learn, a system to deliver it, and the balls to put yourself out there.

Start with your unfair advantage. Everyone has one, you're just not seeing it. That thing you've spent years doing that feels mundane to you? Someone would pay to learn it faster. Could be your copywriting skills, your understanding of SEO, how you got fit after 30, how you negotiate freelance rates. The mistake is thinking it needs to be unique. It doesn't. It needs to be packaged in YOUR voice with YOUR perspective. There are 500 fitness coaches but only one with your exact background and communication style. That's the edge.

I watched this play out with a girl who spent 5 years in email marketing. She thought everyone knew this stuff. Turns out most small business owners are clueless about email sequences. She created a simple course showing people exactly how to set up automated email funnels. Nothing groundbreaking. Just clear, actionable steps based on what she'd done 100 times professionally. She's at $15k monthly now. Insane read this book if you want to understand this shift: [The $100 Startup](https://chrisguillebeau.com/books/the) by Chris Guillebeau. Guillebeau studied hundreds of people earning $50k+ from tiny businesses. The book won't teach you tactics but it'll rewire how you think about business creation. He shows you don't need funding, you don't need revolutionary ideas, you need speed and willingness to test. Best business book I've read for killing the excuses your brain generates. This will make you question everything you think about starting a business.

Build in public relentlessly. This is the part that separates winners from wannabes. You need an audience. Not millions, just enough people who trust you and value what you know. Write threads on Twitter breaking down your process. Make YouTube videos showing your work. Start a newsletter sharing weekly insights. The content serves dual purpose, it builds authority and it validates demand. If people engage with your free content, they'll pay for the concentrated version.

The framework that works is give away 90% of your knowledge for free, charge for the remaining 10% that's implementation, personalization, or time saving structure. People don't just buy information anymore, they buy transformation and convenience. Your course or service needs to get them from point A to point B faster than they could alone. Most people already know they should exercise and eat better. They pay trainers for accountability and customized plans.

If you want to go deeper on entrepreneurship and business psychology but feel overwhelmed by dense business books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed). It's a personalized learning app that turns top business books, founder interviews, and startup case studies into custom audio podcasts tailored to your goals. You can type something like ""I want to build a one person business around my marketing skills but don't know where to start,"" and it'll generate a structured learning plan pulling from resources like the books mentioned here plus expert insights you might not find elsewhere.

What makes it useful is the flexibility. You can start with a quick 10 minute overview, and if something clicks, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples and implementation details. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this smoky, conversational tone that makes business concepts way more digestible during commutes or gym sessions. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science backed.

Use Gumroad for selling digital products. Clean interface, handles payments, minimal fees. You can have a product live in an hour. Or Teachable if you're doing courses with multiple modules. The platform matters less than actually launching. Too many people spend months building perfect websites and systems. Ship something basic, iterate based on feedback. Your first version will be rough. That's fine. Version 10 will be polished but you can't get there without version 1 being out in the world making money.

[The Minimalist Entrepreneur by Sahil Lavingia](https://minimalistentrepreneur.com/) nails this approach. Lavingia built Gumroad and this book is essentially his playbook. He argues against the Silicon Valley model of raising millions and scaling fast. Instead, start profitable from day one, grow slowly, stay small intentionally. He walks through finding community first, building what they need, monetizing immediately. It's the anti hustle culture business book. Insanely good read that'll save you from wasting years on the wrong approach. The chapter on ""building in public"" alone is worth the price.

Pricing psychology is crucial. Charge more than you think you should. Seriously. If your gut says $29, make it $97. People associate price with value. Undercharging signals you don't believe in your product. I've seen the same course sell poorly at $49 then fly off shelves at $297. The higher price attracted more serious buyers who actually implemented and got results, which created better testimonials, which drove more sales. It's counterintuitive but real.

The beautiful part about productizing yourself is it decouples income from time. You create once, sell infinitely. Record a video course over two weeks, sell it for years. Write an ebook in a month, generate passive income forever. Compare that to trading hours for dollars where your ceiling is determined by how much time you have. This isn't about getting rich quick. It's about building an asset that pays you while you sleep, travel, spend time with family, or build the next thing.

Company of One by Paul Jarvis completely changed how I think about business growth. Jarvis argues for staying small intentionally, questioning growth for growth's sake, optimizing for freedom over revenue. He's run a successful one person business for years earning multiple six figures. The book challenges every Silicon Valley assumption about needing to scale and hire and expand. Sometimes the best business is one that stays lean, stays profitable, and gives you your life back. This is the best book for understanding why bigger isn't always better and how to build something sustainable solo.

The biggest mental block is imposter syndrome. You'll think you're not qualified enough, not experienced enough, not whatever enough. That voice lies. If you're three steps ahead of someone, you're qualified to teach them those three steps. You don't need a PhD. You need practical knowledge and ability to communicate it clearly. The market decides if you're qualified, not your inner critic.

Start today. Pick your topic, outline what you'd teach, create a simple landing page describing it. Before building anything, see if people will pre order. If 10 people give you money for something that doesn't exist yet, you've validated demand. Now go build it. If nobody bites, adjust the positioning or topic and test again. You're looking for the intersection of what you know, what people want, and what you enjoy enough to talk about repeatedly.

The one person business model isn't some distant dream. It's a very accessible path to freedom, control, and income that scales beyond your time. You just have to be willing to share what you know, put yourself out there, and treat yourself like the valuable product you actually are.",1,1770269999.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

1. the city is loud and alive, and
2. it can still feel weirdly lonely when you don’t have your “call at 11pm to rant and laugh” people.

So… hello, Slightly amused, definitely hopeful, and officially enrolling myself in the **Find-a‑Friend Program** because my social circle is currently a **dot** and I would like to upgrade it to, at minimum, a triangle. I've tried this before a couple of times but haven't found success yet sadly but I shall not give up!

If you’re the kind who overshares a little, replies with more than “hey,” and believes friendships are slow love stories without the romance (just effort, inside jokes, and “reached?” texts), we’ll get along.

**The “is this someone I can vibe with?” summary:**

* **Me in one breath:** food nerd, Indian‑indie, Indie Folk, Pop,  letter‑writer, night owl, golden‑retriever energy with occasional introvert reboot.
* **What I’m here for:** **long‑term friends:** online counts, but if you’re in/around Bangalore I’m genuinely up for meeting IRL whenever you're comfortable (public + easy plans). Heck, maybe I'd even cook for you and make you a nice cup of coffee!
* **Conversation style:** memes + honesty + chaotic curiosity. “Hey” is allowed… but only if you follow it up with literally anything interesting.
* **What you’ll get:** playlists, memes, thoughtful check‑ins, and someone who’s very excited about **tiny tomatoes and pepper plants** and **big brownies along with a lot of other baked goodies**!

**A Bit about the person you're signing up for!**

**1) Reading first, therapy second** 

My camera roll is basically split into two categories:

* Random things
* food 
* pictures of my cat



**2) Music & media (playlists are my love language, platonically)**

Music is a big part of my life and I listen to almost everything… 

I mostly listen to a lot of Indie, Indie Pop, Folk, and recently gotten into Japanese rock too!

Classical + jazz: I’m still exploring jazz like a polite guest who doesn’t want to touch anything fragile.

I also keep too many playlists: If we click, I will 100% make one named after you.

Headphones lore (for the fellow nerds): IEMs for travel, AirPods day‑to‑day.

**Shows I’ve enjoyed:** This is a very long list so I won't call it out but I really adore Sci-Fi shows, British Comedy, just old comedy shows.

**3) Podcasts (road trips, chores, and “I need background noise to exist”)**

 A mix of finance/books/movies/music pods for daily life.

I’m the guy who can do a long drive and somehow make it feel like we’re in a documentary… except we’re just looking for snacks and taking wrong turns.

4**) Books & writing (soft hours + occasional emotional damage)**

Lit fic to whatever steals my heart.

I write stories  based on my life experiences , I’m your most enthusiastic reader. 

**5) Outdoorsy… ish (with strong “ish” energy)**

I love road trips, easy hikes, and the dream of doing a lot of really super hard treks I keep threatening to do.

**6) Creativity & collections**

I’m learning digital art on my tablet which  I spent a month’s salary on and sometimes regret not using enough .

**7) The vibe / the fine print**

Mostly golden‑retriever energy (I will hype you up). Occasionally I need quiet to recharge (introvert reboot). I’ve had brushes with anxiety and the blues; I try to be the friend I needed then: consistent, kind, honest.

I don’t disappear forever but if I go quiet, I return and pick up right where we left off.

**What I’m looking for (and what I’m not)**

* **Friends.** Friendship‑friendship. The kind that grows and sticks.
* **Adults (18+)** of any age, gender, sexuality or anything. No age cap. You just have to be a good human.
* **Effortful conversation.** Not essays. just… more than “hey” and “wyd.”
* **Nearby (Bangalore)?** Let’s actually meet: public, easy, low‑pressure hangs.
* **Not nearby?** Still yes: consistent chats + a weekly/biweekly voice call works great but if you're here, I'd love to meet in person and catch up often!
* **Boundaries:** I don’t judge your choices; just don’t push them on me or anyone else. Kindness over coolness.

**Things we could actually do (menu of small beginnings)**

Pick one. Or pitch your own.

* Chai/coffee + walk + playlist swap (you judge my taste; I pretend I don’t care).
* Co‑working session (mics off, lo‑fi on, meme breaks + colleague rants allowed).
* Bookshop crawl + café reading + “pick a book for each other.”
* Plan a trek/drive we actually do (bonus points if snacks are elite and jokes are terrible).

**Why you might like being friends with me**

* I show up. I keep my word. I don’t ghost.
* I’m a great vent‑listener and a decent advice‑giver (only if you want it).
* I’ll celebrate your tiny wins like they’re grand finales.
* If you’re having a 4am wobble, I’m more likely to be awake than asleep.
* I write little notes for people I care about. (Consent first. Nobody needs a surprise novella.)
* If we share a city, I’m the “I’ll be there in 20” friend… minus the shovel joke. (…unless you think it’s funny. Then, kidding.)

**How to message me (so we skip the awkward opener)**

Send me a DM with:

1. **Where you are** (Bangalore neighborhood / city / country / time zone)
2. **One thing you’re obsessed with lately** (song/book/game/recipe/plant/weird fact)
3. **One tiny plan for the next 2 weeks** you’d do with me (from the menu above)
4. **Where you prefer to chat** (we start on Reddit; move elsewhere if both comfy)

Optional cheat code: work the word **“cinnamon”** into your message so I know you actually read this and aren’t a “hey wyd” drive‑by.

1qwct5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/futurelight/comments/1qwct5d/create_an_inviting_atmosphere_in_your_durban_home/,Create an Inviting Atmosphere in Your Durban Home with Modern LED Kitchen Lighting,"Many people think about kitchen lighting in terms of “bright enough” versus “too dim.” In practice, creating an inviting kitchen comes down to layering different types of light, choosing the right colour temperature, and placing fittings where they support how you actually use the space.

A good starting point is to separate the idea of “seeing clearly” from “feeling comfortable.” Vision is mostly about task lighting: you want strong, controlled light on work surfaces so chopping, cooking, and cleaning are safe and easy. Comfort is about ambient and accent lighting: softer light that fills the room without glare and helps define the mood.

In most kitchens, a single central ceiling fitting is still doing most of the work. It tends to create shadows on counters, because your body blocks the light as you lean over the worktop. This is where under-cabinet LED strips or bars become important. By placing light directly under the wall units, close to the splashback, you get even illumination on the entire counter. The light falls in front of your hands, not behind them, which sharpens contrast and reduces eye strain.

When choosing under-cabinet lighting, a continuous LED strip provides very uniform light with no “hot spots” if it is installed in an aluminium channel with a diffuser. LED bar lights are a bit more defined in appearance, but can still be very effective. For task areas, a colour temperature in the neutral white range, around 4000K, usually works well. It feels clean and crisp without being as harsh as very cool white.

Ambient lighting is what prevents the kitchen from feeling clinical. Downlights, track lights, or a surface-mounted linear fitting can all work as general lighting, but the trick is to avoid making them the only layer. Fewer, brighter downlights are not as comfortable as more fittings run at a lower output. That is one reason dimmable LED drivers are popular: they let you run fittings below maximum output for a softer background level, and then bring them up when you need extra brightness.

Colour temperature is one of the most misunderstood aspects. Warm white (around 2700–3000K) tends to feel more relaxed and is close to traditional incandescent light. Neutral white (around 4000K) feels more “daylight in a room” and is often preferred for modern kitchens and people who cook a lot. Very cool white (5000K and above) can emphasize every mark and can feel a bit stark in a home setting, even if it seems very bright on paper.

In Durban and other coastal areas, natural light and climate play a role as well. Bright outdoor conditions mean your eyes adapt to higher light levels during the day, so an overly warm, dim kitchen can feel gloomy by comparison. Many lighting specialists, including the team at Future Light, often recommend either neutral white throughout, or a mix of neutral white task lighting with slightly warmer ambient lighting. The aim is to balance clarity with comfort, not to chase a single “perfect” colour.

Accent lighting is sometimes dismissed as purely decorative, but it has a practical effect on how welcoming a kitchen feels. A simple LED strip on top of wall cabinets, washing light onto the ceiling, can make low ceilings feel higher and soften corners. Toe-kick lighting along the base of cabinets offers a gentle glow at night, enough to navigate the kitchen without switching on stronger lights. These lower-level accents also reduce contrast between bright work surfaces and dark floors, which is easier on the eyes.

Glare is another technical issue that affects comfort. Bare, intense LED points can feel uncomfortable, even if the total lumens are appropriate. Choosing fittings with diffusers, recessed light sources, or good shielding helps distribute light more evenly. Matte finishes on nearby surfaces also help by reducing reflections. This is one of the areas where a professional lighting layout makes a noticeable difference: it is not only about how much light you have, but how that light is controlled.

From an energy and maintenance point of view, modern LEDs are straightforward: long life, low power, and relatively little heat compared to old halogen fittings. The quality differences lie in colour consistency, flicker control, and dimming performance. An experienced lighting team such as Future Light will usually look at compatibility between the drivers, dimmers, and LEDs to avoid buzzing, flicker at low levels, or uneven dimming between fittings.

If you are planning a new kitchen or an upgrade, it can help to sketch three layers on paper: first, where you absolutely need strong, shadow-free task light; second, where you want general ambient coverage; and third, where a softer accent could make the space feel more welcoming. Then match each area to an LED type and colour temperature. This layered approach is more reliable than choosing fittings purely by appearance or by a single “bright enough” target.

Over time, you will probably find that the most inviting kitchens are not the brightest ones, but the most flexible ones: spaces where you can shift from high-output task lighting while cooking, to a softer, warmer scene for a late dinner or early-morning coffee, simply by using the right mix of LEDs and sensible control.

I’m 35, a full-time dad to two amazing kids who light up my world. They’re not just in my life; they are the center of it. Their laughter, wonder, and unique way of seeing the world constantly remind me of what truly matters.

1qwcrrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askandrew/comments/1qwcrrm/best_espresso_machine_buying_guide_2026_avoid/,Best Espresso Machine Buying Guide 2026: Avoid These Mistakes Most People Make,"Many people buy an espresso machine thinking they will instantly get café-quality coffee at home, then realize later:

* The coffee tastes bad
* The machine is hard to use
* Or it doesn’t match their daily routine

In 2026, espresso marketing is still full of buzzwords like *15-bar pressure*, *pro steam wand*, and *Italian pump,* but none of that matters if the machine doesn’t fit how you actually drink coffee.

This guide focuses only on what truly matters, so you don’t waste money.

**Best Espresso Machines (for reference)**

**1) Breville Barista Express**

* All-in-one machine with built-in grinder
* Great balance between automation and control
* Ideal for beginners who still want real espresso skills

[https://amzn.to/46jPuLY](https://amzn.to/46jPuLY)

**Best for:** People who want café-style coffee without buying a separate grinder.

**2) Gaggia Classic Pro**

* Fully manual espresso machine
* Commercial-style 58mm portafilter
* Requires a separate grinder

[https://amzn.to/4afOIAO](https://amzn.to/4afOIAO)

**Best for:** People who enjoy hands-on brewing and learning real barista technique.

**3) De'Longhi Rivelia**

* Thermoblock heating system for fast warm-up
* Easy-to-use controls with programmable options
* Good milk frothing performance with automatic steam wand

[https://amzn.to/3ZiGbrY](https://amzn.to/3ZiGbrY)

**Best for:** People who want a strong balance between convenience and quality without going fully automatic.

**1) Buying a machine without budgeting for a grinder**

This is the #1 mistake.

Espresso needs fresh, fine, consistent grounds.

A ₹40k machine with pre-ground coffee will taste worse than a ₹20k machine with a good grinder.

If your machine doesn’t include a grinder, you *must* buy one separately.

Rule of thumb:  
Your grinder matters as much as your espresso machine.

**2) Thinking “15-bar pressure” means better coffee**

* Almost every machine advertises 15 or 19 bars.
* Real espresso uses \~9 bars.
* Higher numbers are just pump ratings, not brewing quality.

Ignore pressure marketing.

Focus on:

* Temperature stability
* Grinder quality
* User control

**3) Underestimating the learning curve**

Manual machines don’t work like coffee makers.

You will need to learn:

* Grind size
* Tamping
* Shot timing
* Milk frothing

Expect 1–2 weeks of practice before great results.

If you want *zero learning*, you actually want a fully automatic machine, not espresso.

**4) Expecting café results without effort**

Cafés use:

* Commercial grinders
* Dialed-in recipes
* Trained baristas

At home, you are the barista.

Great espresso comes from:

* Fresh beans
* Consistent grinding
* Repetition

Not from the machine alone.

**5) Ignoring daily maintenance**

Every espresso machine needs:

* Daily wipe down
* Regular descaling
* Milk wand cleaning

Skip this and performance drops fast.

Espresso machines are hobbies, not appliances.

**Practical tips that actually improve your coffee**

These come from long-time home espresso users:

* Buy freshly roasted beans (not supermarket stock)
* Use a digital scale for dosing
* Purge steam wand immediately after frothing
* Warm your cup before pulling shots
* Start with medium roast beans (more forgiving)

Small habits = massive taste improvement.

**Final honest takeaway**

* Don’t buy espresso without planning for a grinder
* Cheap machines won’t magically make café coffee
* Manual espresso requires learning
* Specs matter less than workflow
* Fresh beans + practice beat expensive hardware

**Simple recommendation:**

* Beginner, all-in-one: Breville Barista Express
* Hands-on enthusiast: Gaggia Classic Pro + separate grinder
* Balanced convenience & quality: De’Longhi Rivelia

**Curious what others are doing**

If you already make espresso at home:

* What machine are you using
* Separate grinder or built-in
* How long did it take to get good shots

Real experiences help everyone choose better.

*If you are confused between two models or unsure what fits your routine (daily latte? weekend espresso? office use?), tell me, happy to help you pick the right setup.*",2,1770269473.0,askandrew,2,1.0,False

$400 groceries (typically have $50 left over)

$350 gas, car maintenance, car insurance (typically $50 left over)

$500 dining out including work coffees (I work from the coffee shop on campus a lot of times)

$250 health, vitamins, doc apptmts, dog health/vet visits (actual spend varies wildly from using none to overspending by double)

$150 Gifts and donations (includes paying for others while dining out)

$200 Entertainment and education (books, classes, movies)

$250 alcohol (both dining out cocktails and store bought purchases. I like this as its own category because it helps me be mindful of my drinking)

$300 Clothes and beauty (all thrifting, clothes, nails, haircuts, non-essential beauty products)

$450 General all-purpose sinking fund and for one-time or unexpected expenses (my biggest problem with this fund is that when I don't use it for its intended purpose, I treat it as extra ""Clothes and beauty"" envelope money. I use on average 50% as intended each month)

1qwcnpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1qwcnpm/booth_vs_cbs_for_investment_banking/,Booth ($$) vs CBS ($$) for Investment Banking,"Hey all, I'm trying to make a very tough decision between these two programs and would appreciate some opinions. I recently attended the Columbia admit day and will be going to Booth's as well. I'm very much on the fence and would like to get my thoughts on paper before the Booth event, since the deadline for both schools is RIGHT after.

Tentatively, I intend to recruit for NYC investment banking since it just seems like the place to be if I want to make finance my long-term career.

Financial aid wise, I've received the same \~50% award at both schools. I asked both for more aid, was denied at Booth, and am waiting for CBS but will likely also be denied.

Here are the general areas of importance I've considered:

COL: Rent is probably going to be in the 3-4K range in NYC instead of the 1.5-2.5K in Chicago, and for a smaller space/worse quality of life. Likely going to go out more and spend more overall just existing. Going to Chicago, I'd still need to pay for an NYC apartment for the summer to do my internship, which I ballpark at $10K. Even with that, I estimate that I'd probably spend $40-60K more at CBS over the two years.

Social: Having briefly been in both cities as a tourist, NYC clearly has much more to do, but CBS itself gives me commuter vibes. I feel like living spread out around the city will make it harder to meet and make friends, whereas a supermajority of students live in the same 3-block radius at Booth. But I'd be giving up NYC in the short term (though I'm not sure it'd be financially wise with a student budget to be doing everything on offer anyways). And, the people I vibed best with at the CBS event were other out-of-towners. I got the impression that NYC natives weren't too interested in the social aspect, but maybe they're just slower to open up. On the other hand, I feel like Booth is going to have far more people not from Chicago.

Recruiting: Both schools seem to be very good at recruiting into NYC associate roles. CBS allows me to feel out banks more via actual in-person facetime. The process is more high touch, I'll be expected to take the subway over to their offices, sometimes on short notice, and is probably overall more stress. At Booth, the process seems far more chill. All coffee chats are on Zoom, banks will fly out to do on campus info sessions, and you only need to fly into NYC to do a tour, round 1s, and superdays. I've been told that 70-80% of Booth bankers end up in NYC anyways, so unless I were recruiting for small shops or boutique PE, I don't really see being in Chicago as a disadvantage. I'm unsure if their placements are materially different in terms of ""prestige"", e.g. is CBS more likely to place at a tier 1 vs a tier 3 bank? But I do know that in-term internships are much more accessible in NYC, though I don't think that's very important for banking as it's more useful for less structured recruiting paths.

Miscellaneous: While Columbia put on a great admit day and I haven't even seen Booth's yet, Booth students have been doing a much better job of reaching out to handhold admits and onboard us on cost of attendance, where to live, and other logistical stuff. Of course, they probably HAVE to employ tactics like this to win over fence sitters like myself, since there are a ton of NYC die-hards who lean heavily Columbia. Also, for what it's worth, Columbia is an Ivy and has better international namebrand if I ever wanted to move abroad.

I'm sure the Booth event is going to be fun, I'm gonna meet a ton of great people, and I'm gonna love the city too. So I'm trying to make my decision with the existing knowledge I have.

In summary, I feel like it'd probably be less friction to go to Booth, enjoy Chicago for 2 years since I'll probably never live there ever again, recruit for NYC banking, and end up in NYC anyways. But I can't help but feel like I'm making a short-sighted decision by pursuing the path I perceive as smoother at Booth, versus just grinding as hard as possible at CBS. After all, if I want to be in NYC, shouldn't I just skip straight there? Or does taking a detour to Chicago make sense given all the other variables?

Please, give me any and all opinions. It's an extremely tough choice, and I appreciate all POVs.",3,1770269122.0,MBA,10,1.0,False

1qwcn2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1qwcn2f/shifting_front_teeth_after_accident/,Shifting front teeth after accident,"About a year and a half ago I hit my face smack into a coffee table. It took out half of my left incisor and pushed my left front tooth inwards. Luckily I saw my dentist quickly after that and they decided that the best course of action was to put a crown on the incisor and keep an eye on the front tooth that was pushed back. The tooth that was pushed back is a little wiggly (more noticeable to me than when they actually check it), and sometimes can be sensitive to cold and hot. 

Recently I’ve noticed that my front tooth that was pushed in feels different. It feels almost stuck and i don’t know else how to explain other than it feels like i can feel the roots stuck. If I put my tongue at my back gumline, I can feel pressure but it’s not painful. That might be completely off but i’m not sure how else to explain. I guess my question is if after a trauma like this happens, can your tooth continue to shift over time? And is that a possibility as to why it might be bothering me after so much time has passed? I’ll probably do a follow up with my dentist to be safe but wanted to see if this is something that can happen. 

TLDR: Front tooth was pushed in after an accident and now almost 2 years later feels like the tooth is shifting. Is this normal? ",1,1770269064.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I've been developing this for about 18 months now and it's been a long journey. I started building it to try to find triggers for my chronic sinus infections and sleep paralysis, but filling out forms every day felt like a chore. I landed on categorizing natural language journal entries because it takes significantly less mental energy to just write everything out as you think it.

* All processing local on your Mac, no cloud, under 100mb of ram
* Sub-second categorization per sentence, timeline and list view update as you type
* Adaptive corrections that remember every fix you make, so after about a week it learns your personal vocabulary and you can use whatever shorthand feels natural
* Weather and location + people metadata for most data points, both integrated into generated insights

The whole system is built around collecting data then using statistical methods to find correlations with outcome metrics you define yourself (anything you can think of, knee pain, morning energy, daily toenail growth, anything). You can use it to track subtle changes in your subjective experience while changing medications or supplements, adding new exercises, whatever. I'm working on a bunch of features including taking in wearables data and apple health, if there is any data type that you want added, please reach out and we can see if it's possible.

1qwckiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysphagia/comments/1qwckiu/constant_pain_and_choking_from_hyoid_bone_popping/,Constant pain and choking from hyoid bone popping,"Tldr; my [32F] hyoid bone pops when I swallow or move my neck causing significant pain and disruption to my life. I feel like Ive tried everything and I dont know what else to do. 

One morning in 2019, I [32F] woke up and my hyoid bone started behaving abnormally. Whenever I swallow or when I turn my head, my hyoid bone pops. This occurs on both sides and is like my hyoid bone collides with everything else nearby as it moves. Sometimes it can be extremely painful when it catches or pinches something else when it does this. For examples, it'll pinch something and send sharp shooting pain into my face or even down my neck and into my chest, typically followed by radiating pain usually for a few days. I do regularly choke while eating, drinking, or even just normally swallowing my own spit. Choking usually happens when I'm moving or turning my head while swallowing. The muscles to my hyoid bone are always noticeably swollen and tender and my neck is always stiff and sore. It does choke me pretty regularly when I sleep as well and I wake up coughing, gagging, and gasping for air. A lot of times its so uncomfortable to sleep because the pressure laying down will put on it and pushes it out of position. The only position that reduces or minimizes the popping is then I look up and put my chin back as far as possible. Even then it still slightly does it. Others can feel it pop just by placing their fingers lightly on my throat while I swallow. I cannot pop it back into place or get it to stop even for short periods of time. 

I've seen numerous ENTs, bone&joint specialists, phyical and massage therapists. We did rule out injury and syndromes like Eagles. All bloodwork has been normal. One ent told me it would just go away over time. It has not, it never stops there are no breaks, it happens EVERY time. Another ent told me Id just have to learn to live with it... fine... but how do I manage the contant pain and choking? Most have no idea how to approach or deal with this issue. There are some things that help reduce or temporarily reduce the pain such as massage, ibuprofen, lidocaine patches, or muscle relaxers. All of which are temporary relief and usually very short lived. And nothing stops the popping itself. I did eventually get recommended to an ent who specialized in this part of the throat. He told me it was likely due to injuty, weight fluctuations, or age. He said my bone was ever so slightly longer than normal but didnt really think it would be a major contributing factor. He said we could try shaving it down but it may resolve nothing or even make swallowing or use of my tongue worse. So I never followed through. He tried giving me steroid shots to my hyoid muscles to help reduce the inflammation and pain. Said it could last months to years. It did basically nothing and I had more negative side effects than good. He said to try physical therapy which I had already been doing and again... minor temporary pain reduction was it. One of my physical therapists even told me that I have a ""low tolerance for being uncomfortable"" and that everyone feels this way and is in some sort of pain as they age. 

I feel like I've tried everything and its driving me insane. I feel like my quality of life and my wallet decreases with every year I have to deal with this and Im at my wits end. I thought about seeing if anyone else on reddit has experienced something like this before and what they did to resolve it. All the posts Im seeing that are similar to my own are in the hypermobility, Cheers Danlos (EDS), or TMJ subs... so I figured Id reach out to each and see what people think. Has this happened to you? Did you resolve it or find relief? What are your experiences? I welcome and and all advice and recommendations. 



A few more details that may or maynot be relevant: 
I do have several friends with EDS and while talking to them I thought it might be worth mentioning to my primary care doctor... we did the Brighton test and think I only got a 2? So he suggested that was likely not the cause and that only more severe cases might result in what is wrong with my sleep and hyoid. I can bend my thumbs to my forearm with ease, but none of my joints hyper extend and Ive never been able to touch my toes (not even I was a child or when I did numerous competitive sports). I am the stiffest least flexible person on the face of the planet and I've always been that way. However, I can sublax (or partially separate/dislocate) my wrists and ankles. Left side is worse than the right but I can do it to all of them at will or even when pressure is put on them in a specific way. A few years back I tripped so many times that I had to see a doctor for it, and I remember one of the PAs in training exclaiming ""thats the loosest one Ive ever felt!"" to his poor trainers horror. Lol. I can pop my wrists and elbows like people do their knuckles. My elbows do have a little laxity but I only ever notice it when I shake my arms and can feel a lot of movement in that joint. When I was a kid I could move my knee cap all over the place, but as I got older it hurt way too much so I dont touch it anymore and some of that laxity seems to have gone. I can pop my knee cap tho. I did have a cousin with EDS, but I know that doesn't mean much genetically.

I do also have idopathic hypersomnia and have likely had this my whole life but was diagnosed in 2012. Originally was diagnosed as borderline narcolepsy type 2 but was later identified to be far more likely to be idopathic hypersomnia. 

I respond weird to meds... I tend to get a lot of the side effects. Specifically, stimulants do nothing to me, even in high doses. This is true for coffee, tea, or the prescription varieties (and Ive tried numerous for my sleep disorder). All I get is a headache and dizziness. And I've woken up in the middle of simple procedures that I was put under for. 

I do grind my teeth in my sleep and have since I was a kid. The popping does not seem to be directly correlated with teeth grinding and clenching and I can have flare ups of both that are unrelated. But when my jaw is especially tight and sore from grinding and clenching, the pops are a little more painful than not. I mentioned this to all of my ENTs and sleep docs, none seem to be concerned about this contributing. ",1,1770268850.0,dysphagia,0,1.0,False

I am 21, Since about early/mid December. Ive been experiencing some localized gum discomfort/pain in the top front part of my gums for the past 2 months (both inner and outer parts of that region, but mostly the inside. I thought it would go away on its own. And it hasnt. Ive seen my dentist about a month ago due to this issue, and she basically shrugged at me. Said that it could be several things. But likely is just gum trauma. No signs of cavities, no signs of infection, and just to try and ride it out (also used it as an opportunity to suggest invisalign to me for some reason.) 

Im sick of having to be careful about everything I eat. Avoiding acidic and crunchy foods, cut out soda and coffee (coffee being a huge hobby of mine which feels incredibly frustrating to have to sacrifice) for the past 40 days. 

Yes, I do smoke. I smoke cigars (which im not going to get into my own anecdotes that ive done within my personal research and experience with the downsides between premium cigars and cigarettes) however. Its something thats required of me in my job. I work at a cigar lounge. I havent smoked a cigar in over a month to try and prevent irritation. Which has been great for my confidence in the habit not being a problem for me. But its seriously hampering my ability to  A. Do my job and do it well and B. Enjoy it.  I drink maybe 3 times a month. And its almost always very very little, with plenty of water to ensure hydration. 

Ive tried peroxide mouthwash 3 times a week, weekly, as to not erode any enamel but have stopped due to concerns of it eroding enamel. And i have been consistently using a warm saltwater rinse 4ish times a day, ontop of xylitol gum 5 times a day to ensure proper exposure. And using antiseptic mouthwash as of late aswell.

I was formerly diagnosed with gingivitis. I used to have a mild case. As I used to take very poor care of my teeth, since then it has been declared in remission, and I have very very healthy teeth and gums (aside from the minor breakout of plaque which i usually scrape away gently) 

I take no medications, but i do take vitamin c, Ashwaghanda, and a multivitamin, along with some magnesium for stress. Ive also been taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen to help with managing the pain and soreness at work. 

If you have any further questions. Please dont hesitate to ask. I just want to resolve this as quickly as I possibly can.

1qwcehp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1qwcehp/need_advicedad_in_memory_care_mom_in_independent/,"Need advice...Dad in Memory Care, Mom in Independent Living","Background: we had to move my parents into a facility a while back (Phoenix, AZ). Dad is 83, mid-stages of dementia, Mom is 80. When they were first looking at the move, my Dad was in the earlier stages and refused to move, which would have put them into an apartment together for a year or so, but we finally forced the issue when we were able to activate medical power of attorney on my Dad, which resulted in the current living arrangement where they're in the same facility but in different wings. For the 2-3 years before that, though, my Mom was miserable because she was acting as a full-time caretaker for a man with zero filter, insulting her non-stop, leaving the house at random hours of the night, etc. The usual.

Now that they're in the facility, my Mom has basically chosen to live in hell, and it seems entirely ""by choice"". Dad has always been a flirt, so Mom has determined that Dad is, obviously, sleeping with every female in Memory Care. When we visit Dad with Mom, if she sees a particular woman, she'll point her out and say, ""That's the bitch he's been sleeping with."" Note: we've never seen this woman interact with my Dad, and I've asked the staff, who are adamant that there's nothing there. Because of her determination, it's resulted in her spending her life almost entirely in Memory Care to keep the other women away. When I see her, she admits that she hasn't done any of the activities that she was looking forward to before moving in. She has zero friends; there have been multiple women in Ind Living that have told her to come sit with them at dinner, come to Bingo, etc., but she refuses.

In the meantime, I've also started to notice signs that she's saying things that are obviously not true. She told me there were hidden cameras in her room that the staff were using to spy on her. Despite the fact that we know she has a cleaning staff come through once a week, she told my brother that they won't clean her apartment because she's in independent living. One of the first nights she slept over with Dad in Memory Care (something I told her not to do), she either was hit by Dad and covered for him, or she actually did fall and had a massive bloody nose; the staff heard her scream, rushed to his room, and she had several nurses helping out. We only know about this because she told us, and she needed our help to buy gifts to give to the staff in appreciation. Now? Just two weeks ago, she insisted to me that when this happened, she was told by the staff they couldn't help her, since she was in Independent Care. The list goes on.

Now, last week, she claims that she went to visit my Dad in a morning and, when she noticed his coffee mugs were missing, he supposedly said that he left them at ""girlfriend's"" apartment after spending the night there. Bear in mind, his dementia has destroyed his short-term memory; he has no idea where he slept, so I'm 99% sure that he said, ""I don't know"", and Mom has made assumptions.

Since then, all hell's broken loose. There have been multiple instances of shouting matches, at least three physical altercations, etc., so she's continually being told to leave Memory Care. Despite all this, she keeps returning, dutifully, at least three times a day, with Dad 100% forgetting that anything happened or having any reason to be upset.

I've now had ""the talk"" with her at least once a week for the past 3 months:  
1. he's now, essentially, a little boy with zero idea what he's doing or why  
2. it seems dangerous to sleep with him (he has woken up at least once, insisting that this woman in his bed was an imposter, pretending to be his wife)  
3. all her reasons for moving into this facility appear to have been pushed aside in the pursuit of what seems to be a paranoid obsession

I've been pushing her to pursue a therapist, even referring her to BetterHelp so she couldn't use transportation as an excuse; she's refusing, because there are no issues, in her mind, aside from Dad.

It's now to the point where she's pushing to move out of the facility ASAP, taking Dad with her. She somehow feels that a return to living together in an apartment/townhouse/etc. would somehow be an improvement, knowing full-well she'd have no way to prevent him from leaving and wandering the streets at night.

So...I'm at a loss now. I simply no longer know what to do.",4,1770268338.0,dementia,13,1.0,False

1qwcchw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsHotinUAE/comments/1qwcchw/john_mayer_at_saadiyat_nights_has_been/,John Mayer at Saadiyat Nights has been rescheduled – here’s what actually matters,"If you were gearing up for John Mayer’s Saadiyat Nights debut, there’s a date change you’ll want to clock.

**New confirmed date:**  
🗓 **Saturday, 15 February 2026**  
📍 **Saadiyat Nights, Saadiyat Island – Abu Dhabi**

https://preview.redd.it/p3oj61zb6ufg1.jpg?width=1581&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=064046f916201ba24e5f881b791cb79c3a21fee9

According to organisers, the postponement is down to unforeseen circumstances (frustrating, but not uncommon with large-scale live events).

**Tickets & refunds (important bit):**

* ✅ **All existing tickets remain valid** for the new date – no action needed
* ❌ Can’t make it? You can request a refund via [**Ticketmaster.ae**](http://Ticketmaster.ae)
* ⏰ **Refund deadline: 21 January 2026**
* 📧 Email: [**customerservice@ticketmaster.ae**](https://) with your booking details

**Why this still matters:**  
This isn’t a one-off gig. Saadiyat Nights 2026 is shaping up to be one of Abu Dhabi’s strongest live music seasons yet, with a genuinely diverse lineup:

* Lewis Capaldi – 17 Jan 2026
* Max Richter – 29 Jan 2026
* Ricky Martin – 31 Jan 2026
* Mariah Carey – 7 Feb 2026
* Bryan Adams – 11 Feb 2026
* **John Mayer – 15 Feb 2026**

Add the custom-built open-air venue and a surprisingly strong food lineup (Reif Kushiyaki, Home Bakery Kitchen, Slice 45, Junk Burger, ARC coffee), and it’s more festival experience than standard concert night.

Curious what people think:

* Worth holding onto tickets for the new date?
* Is Saadiyat Nights quietly becoming the UAE’s best live-music series?
* Which artist from the lineup are you most excited for?

Always keen to hear other takes.

1qwca10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypermobility/comments/1qwca10/constant_pain_due_to_popping_hyoid/,Constant pain due to popping hyoid,"Tldr; my hyoid bone pops causing significant pain and disruption to my life. Do you have any experiences with this?

One morning in 2019, I [32F] woke up and my hyoid bone started behaving abnormally. Whenever I swallow or when I turn my head, my hyoid bone pops. This occurs on both sides and is like my hyoid bone collides with everything else nearby as it moves. Sometimes it can be extremely painful when it catches or pinches something else when it does this. For examples, it'll pinch something and send sharp shooting pain into my face or even down my neck and into my chest, typically followed by radiating pain usually for a few days. I do regularly choke while eating, drinking, or even just normally swallowing my own spit. Choking usually happens when I'm moving or turning my head while swallowing. The muscles to my hyoid bone are always noticeably swollen and tender and my neck is always stiff and sore. It does choke me pretty regularly when I sleep as well and I wake up coughing, gagging, and gasping for air. A lot of times its so uncomfortable to sleep because the pressure laying down will put on it and pushes it out of position. The only position that reduces or minimizes the popping is then I look up and put my chin back as far as possible. Even then it still slightly does it. Others can feel it pop just by placing their fingers lightly on my throat while I swallow. I cannot pop it back into place or get it to stop even for short periods of time. 

I've seen numerous ENTs, bone&joint specialists, phyical and massage therapists. We did rule out injury and syndromes like Eagles. All bloodwork has been normal. One ent told me it would just go away over time. It has not, it never stops there are no breaks, it happens EVERY time. Another ent told me Id just have to learn to live with it... fine... but how do I manage the contant pain and choking? Most have no idea how to approach or deal with this issue. There are some things that help reduce or temporarily reduce the pain such as massage, ibuprofen, lidocaine patches, or muscle relaxers. All of which are temporary relief and usually very short lived. And nothing stops the popping itself. I did eventually get recommended to an ent who specialized in this part of the throat. He told me it was likely due to injuty, weight fluctuations, or age. He said my bone was ever so slightly longer than normal but didnt really think it would be a major contributing factor. He said we could try shaving it down but it may resolve nothing or even make swallowing or use of my tongue worse. So I never followed through. He tried giving me steroid shots to my hyoid muscles to help reduce the inflammation and pain. Said it could last months to years. It did basically nothing and I had more negative side effects than good. He said to try physical therapy which I had already been doing and again... minor temporary pain reduction was it. One of my physical therapists even told me that I have a ""low tolerance for being uncomfortable"" and that everyone feels this way and is in some sort of pain as they age. 

I thought about seeing if anyone else on reddit has experienced something like this before and what they did to resolve it. All the posts Im seeing that are similar to my own are in the hypermobility, Cheers Danlos (EDS), or TMJ subs... so I figured Id reach out to each and see what people think. Has this happened to you? Did you resolve it or find relief? What are your experiences? 



A few more details that may or maynot be relevant: 
I do have several friends with EDS and while talking to them I thought it might be worth mentioning to my primary care doctor... we did the Brighton test and think I only got a 2? So he suggested that was likely not the cause and that only more severe cases might result in what is wrong with my sleep and hyoid. I can bend my thumbs to my forearm with ease, but none of my joints hyper extend and Ive never been able to touch my toes (not even I was a child or when I did numerous competitive sports). I am the stiffest least flexible person on the face of the planet and I've always been that way. However, I can sublax (or partially separate/dislocate) my wrists and ankles. Left side is worse than the right but I can do it to all of them at will or even when pressure is put on them in a specific way. A few years back I tripped so many times that I had to see a doctor for it, and I remember one of the PAs in training exclaiming ""thats the loosest one Ive ever felt!"" to his poor trainers horror. Lol. I can pop my wrists and elbows like people do their knuckles. My elbows do have a little laxity but I only ever notice it when I shake my arms and can feel a lot of movement in that joint. When I was a kid I could move my knee cap all over the place, but as I got older it hurt way too much so I dont touch it anymore and some of that laxity seems to have gone. I can pop my knee cap tho. I did have a cousin with EDS, but I know that doesn't mean much genetically.

I do also have idopathic hypersomnia and have likely had this my whole life but was diagnosed in 2012. Originally was diagnosed as borderline narcolepsy type 2 but was later identified to be far more likely to be idopathic hypersomnia. 

I respond weird to meds... I tend to get a lot of the side effects. Specifically, stimulants do nothing to me, even in high doses. This is true for coffee, tea, or the prescription varieties (and Ive tried numerous for my sleep disorder). All I get is a headache and dizziness. And I've woken up in the middle of simple procedures that I was put under for. ",1,1770267966.0,Hypermobility,0,1.0,False

1qwc9ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1qwc9ix/frk_group_freckie_capital_bosonic_are_scams/,"FRK Group, Freckie Capital, Bosonic are SCAMS","Freckie Capital and the Bosonic trading app are scams. It all starts out so harmless where the Freckie crew provides 9am premarket updates like clockwork from the core team of Amelia Clarke and AI NAT alleged pioneer Matthew Craig West (both claim to be British) and the post close master, Andrew Seymour Adil to provide worldly recaps from his vast GS and MS insider views on how the money machine really works and how it can work for the little guy all conveniently staged in Oct25 to the yearend and mid Jan26. Ryan Carter is a master scammer, too.

Stage I is the harmless stock tips from the NAT (Nova Auto Trade) 5.0 system where you trade in your personal account and they tell you where to exit. Some tips were not bad. Ok! Then there is a free raffle on Saturdays. Gifts include coffee station, $350 ETH up to $5000 BTC. Alright! Getting to know this AI machine called NAT and all is good.

Stage II is where they beg the elder statesman, Seymour Adil (LinkedIn page and all) to come back and oversee “special opportunities”. He talks about his vast experience on Wall Street and promotes “Block Trades” that are usually saved for the elite where stocks that are $100 can be “obtained” for $85 overnight then sold next day for 17.5% profit or more. The 1^(st) big block was $630m UBER block trade and up to 50% discount to market for the 60day holders thus requiring big money 1.0m+. The lesser profits were 15% for 15days, 25% for 30days and 40% for 45days. No taxes issues either because it is pure profit under the market price.  Wow!!

Stage III – Enter scam app BOSONIC. This is not to be confused with the legitimate Bosonic Digital from nice gentleman named Rosario (LinkedIn) or Bosonic Securities LLC from FINRA in S. Dakota from Sara. Both were contacted after the scam to confirm and they are working with the Cyber Unit from the FBI. You are directed to download the Bosonic App from the App Store. (they are on the 4^(th) version now since Apple takes down the previous scam app Bosonic, BosonicX, BosonicPro and BosonicOne)  Adil states this is the next wave in the digital age and so easy to use.  The app has no contact phone number and no physical address and the only way to contact them is through this goofy little cartoon icon w a headset.  Ok everyone – let’s start liquidating stocks (losers and winners) and wire to your favorite exchange to convert to USDC and send on over. Let’s start making 15-20% overnight on the block trades and start seeing the light.  Yippee!

Stage IV – Is this a scam? Bosonic app did look efficient with a lot of functionality, but no 800 number or address? I demanded a call to a live person at Freckie named David and finally I got a Saturday call. He had a heavy Euro accent, but he said he was from Columbus, OH and remote and that’s how the entire team is structured. Well, it seems like everyone else on the site is super excited about making 25-50% just from holding UBER for 15-30-45-60 days. Oh, one problem is that CoinBase rejected my request to transfer funds to Bosonic and beyond that, they put a 45day hold on my account. What?? This is insane. After a 10day funds hold, I could send the money back to my bank, but not until I had 3k in conversion fees from USD to USDC and BTC and back. Uhggg! Freckie rep offered up a P2P outfit overseas to facilitate my funds to Dubai and then to Bosonic for just 3%.  Uhmmm NO!  The Oct 31 deadline is looming and with a new account open at Crypto dot com, we finally made it with 45k in on the last possible day.  This is the start of something new, something exciting, something BIG!!

Stage V – Early November the FBI Cyber Division had emailed me and I just wrote it off as junk mail. Then in mid November I received a phone call from someone alleging they were from the FBI. I took down the name and had him send me his card as proof, then I called his office to verify he was an agent. I called him back and he informed me that entire operation was a SCAM and to do whatever you could to get your funds back. Unfortunately, I was only halfway through the holding period for the Block trade. He said the operation was overseas and they had no jurisdiction over them. This is why CoinBase restricted my account. Yes, should have stopped there.

Stage VI – Freckie reps are now pushing hard for new funds and they have now solidified agreements with “many” major hedge funds looking to offload blocks of stocks undermarket to keep underneath the radar. There is one catch to get in on this overnight wonder.  You need to sign the agreement starting at 50k for FRK1 all the way to 1.0m for the amazingly profitable FRK6. Oh, and these returns are GUARANTEED 400% to 1000%. If you bring in the big money, you get the highest return blocks of usually 13-15%, otherwise suffer with 5-6% overnight returns. If you can’t swing this, then you can at least “park” your money into the “AutoTrade” feature and NAT AI will pick a good stock or two and auto-invest your account and you can make between 1.25-2.5% per day. Sounds good!

Stage VII – After my UBER Block as matured for 30 market days, I sell and am looking to get the hell out. Of course, after leaving 30% as commission for Team Scam Freckie, Bosonic puts a hold on my account for “commission review”. The rep says oh no you cannot use the profits to pay our commission, this needs to come from another third-party exchange over and above what you have already given us. Awe man – this is a total scam and I am now swimming. After a few days back and forth, the rep relents and Bosonic allows me to pay them 7k+ and then I can retrieve a portion of the funds. I do this and retrieve a portion.  I wait another week to try to pull the rest and now I am seeing the true colors of the Bosonic App Scam. Customer service now says the account if frozen for 15-30days due to “Regulatory” issues, then was stalled for AML issues, then frozen for FINCEN review. Finally, they said my withdrawal address needs a Whitelist Review and fee for that was the exact amount in my account. Really? The responses were beyond childish. This moved to a WhatsApp Service account. Most recently they threatened to distribute a photo of myself and my ID and if I didn’t pay 5,000 Xuan, then they would distribute. I said have at it fools. Freckie and Bosonic joke is on me sadly.

Stage VIII – Interestingly as of Jan16th, Freckie stopped posting to the B39 FRK Capital’s Wealth Code. Who knows if they are onto the next Pig Butcher Slaughter pen.  West was very insulted I even ask for his help trying to retrieve funds. He was too busy with the next big thing – IEO’s (not to be confused with IPO’s). These are fake tokens they offer subscriptions to. Amazingly, Bosonic has an open credit line of over 600k for me to use just willy nilly on these NFT Tokens. I did see that people used these lines and then had to borrow funds or refinance homes to pay the lines back in just enough time for probably a Whitelist review or AML fee. Holy cow!

Summary – 1) If it lives on WhatsApp, it is 99% a scam operation.  2) Verify that there is a valid 800 number and address and confirm.  3) Demand to call the Admin leader on the phone and to talk to 2-3 other patrons to confirm validity (this will shake out any accent and they hate this and demand to be online only)  4)  Watch for Colorado SOS established companies (due to their lax standards) and post office addresses.  5)  Watch for FINRA ID numbers that appear to be in “Good Standing”, but in reality are for fronts for scams showing Money Orders as main business.  Yes, Freckie is there.  6) Never use an app that has a confirmation code.

1qwc96z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1qwc96z/getting_back_into_the_habit_of_things_and_i_want/,Getting back into the habit of things and I want some tips!,"Hi all! I'm 25F, 4'10"", and I flucuate around 115 to 120lbs throughout the month without dieting/exercise.

I started my fitness journey last year and managed to keep to it for a good solid 6 months, doing workouts at home and keeping to my calorie deficit. Losing weight for me was very slow as I work a desk job and am basically sedentary the entire work day, so I had to be very deligent with what I ate and working out. I managed to lose and keep 5lbs off during that time, which wasn't very noticeable imo when I looked at myself, but when I took my measurements it was.

Unfortunately, the last half of the year derailed me. I got put on mandatory overtime (with the rest of my department) which meant I was working for longer periods of time, and by the end of the day I'd be so exhausted I didn't want to cook or workout. My grandmother had a stroke and is now on hospice, so I've been spending what extra time I can with her, and then I got sick for a month with a cold that developed into bronchitis, and then when I recovered from that I got the flu at the end of the year. 

I know the above are all excuses and I probably could have continued if I really tried, but I was mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted. 

Despite that, I am going to try again. I've signed up to my local gym with my husband and we're going to start working out 3 times a week. He's helping me build a workout plan for myself as he's much more familiar with everything than I am, so I am good there, but I DESPERATELY need some snack recommendations as I'm a girl who loves to snack throughout the day, especially since I'm still doing the mandatory overtime and still spend as much free time as I can with my grandma.

I would love things that are convenient and low calorie, so I can maybe just grab something and go without having to prepare it too much, or eat a higher volume of it without feeling like I've just snacked through 700 cals. Some things I already eat are: cottage cheese cooked into scrambled eggs, oatmeal with protein powder added, bell peppers, lost of fruits (mandarin oranges are my big fruit right now, they taste so good!). Also, if y'all have any sugar free or low sugar recommendations for creams or add-ins for coffee, or literally anything to replace soda, I'm all ears!",1,1770267898.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/N5QIYYbn9W): **January 14, 2026**

This is weird so I need to know if I'm crazy for going as far as I did.

I have a condition of chronic pain. The way I explain it to people without chronic pain is that if pain were on levels from 1 to 10, normal people are at most at a 2 or 3 from day to day where people with CP are at more like a 6. Like imagine stepping on a Lego or hitting your funny bone, that's a very brief but excruciating 8. It's like if you pulled a muscle and so there's pain and discomfort if you move it, but pretty much daily. Some days I am higher on the scale, rare blessed days I'm more a 4 or by some miracle lower.

Overall I am active and operate well. I do own canes, but I only use them on days when I'm 7 or above. Such a day came this past Sunday.

On top of my full time job, I have a part time. Due to being physically and legally disabled, I had all the paperwork already filed with my job in case I ever need accommodations. I have a handicap marker on my license plate and the placard on my rear view mirror and the works.

I was recently moved to a location closer to my home. I love my new team. My boss Amy is really great. My colleague Casey and I get along okay but were the same position as assistant coordinators to Amy. The reason I was moved to that location was that it expanded and they needed more hands so they added me.

Casey has wanted a promotion for a long time and everyone knows it. I was pretty open that I don't. Lol any promotion from my position would be a full-time and...I already have a full-time job. I do *this* job to pad my savings and because I frankly like the job. Being busy also helps with my anxiety.

I mean Casey works hard but she also likes to talk over me or rush to take charge of something before I can when I clearly was getting to it. She then announces it. ""Oh I handled that for you, OP. Don't worry!"" And at first I was annoyed but over time I was like alright then, but you didn't have to. I talked to Amy about this. I want to pull my weight but it can be challenging and redundant when Casey is racing to beat me to it. The point was for us to split tasks evenly. Amy said she would talk to her and I don't know what came of that but things didn't really change much so I just accepted it.

So when I came in Monday with my cane, everyone had questions. I emailed Amy Sunday night so she knew but I tend to be private so what I told everyone else was that I have a condition and sometimes I need a cane but not always.

Amy accommodated me. She assigned me tasks that required little to no movement. I was very grateful and got everything done pretty early so I called over the radio if there was anything else I could do. Casey said no she's got it so I just handled admin stuff that's usually on the backburner. Literally replied with ""okay I'll tackle the admin list then"" and Casey said no she's got it but Amy followed that with a thank you to me and confirmation that this would be helpful.

I still needed my cane yesterday (Tuesday) and it was similar. I completed most of the admin to-dos and Amy was so relieved to have it done. She thanked me for coming in and doing all that instead of calling out. Casey made a comment that she could've helped but I said that's okay and thanked her for handling the more physical tasks.

We ended up walking to the parking lot together and she asked which car was mine so I pointed at it. Then she said ""so I know you're not disabled, by the way."" And I asked what she meant. She just repeated herself and said ""so no cane tomorrow, okay? I won't tell. Just no cane tomorrow.""

👀.

I stood there like *what the fuck*? But I was meeting my best friend and just left to make it on time. I met my BFF Joy at the bar and we had a wonderful time. I brought my cane but tbh I didn't always use it. For example, I didn't use it to walk from my table to the bar to request another drink or when I got up to hug Joy goodbye.

Today, when I woke up, my pain was higher than my normal so I took my cane along. I texted Amy that I have my cane but doing okay in small bursts so put me in Coach lol I was having a good time at my main job and didn't give Casey a thought.

I arrive at my part time job and Casey saw my cane and went red. I mean like the way I looked when the Eagles lost to the 49ers lol just SUPER MAD. I greeted everyone and she ignored me completely. We got our assignments and she snidely said to me ""Well can you handle that with your cane and all?"" In a tone that even made Amy turn to look at her like WTF. I said I can manage and thanked her for her concern and we went about our work. Once again she raced to beat me to things and saying over the radio ""don't strain yourself, OP, I did x-task or got y-done""

I was so confused until about an hour ago when we finished work she again walked with me to the parking lot but this time showed me a video. It was me. It was me at the bar last night with Joy. I was just like...um why do you have a video of me - that's weird. She says it's proof. I asked of what? And she said it's proof I'm not disabled as I acted so ""wounded all day at work"" but suddenly don't need my cane at a bar.

What???? I wanted to explain that that's just not how CP works. Like yes I can stand up to hug my friend or get up and walk 3 strides to order a new drink but I can't, for example, lean over and organize a bottom drawer without a chair to sit in. I wanted to explain the CP is just an umbrella and under it are a myriad of experiences and abilities and that honestly, if she had left my tasks alone, I'd have done them. She didn't give me the chance and said ""no cane tomorrow. I'm serious. Or I'm going to Chad"" (Chad is Amy's boss).

I said ""About what?"" But she was already walking away from me and just got in her car.

It's just weird. And oddly Chad would know this is bs because his boyfriend has CP too. I'm not so much worried about being ""found out"" or anything but it's just weird and I'm literally typing an email to Amy CCing Chad about this weird behavior because it's just odd. Am I crazy to want to preemptively explain this? I am anxious ans paranoid in general so I don't want to overreact or make things worse.

Edit: I sent the email and also thanks for letting me know I'm not crazy for feeling weirded out.

Also I will be simply blocking anyone who is saying this is fake. I don't have time for your bs to be frank.

I also texted Amy and Chad.

Edit 2: JESUS CHRYSLER DRIVING CHRIST that's a lot of notifications...

I'll edit to try to reply all here because there isn't enough coffee in the world...

It's morning and I'm still about at a 7 and it's cold today so even if I didn't want to bring my cane, I would have to. I texted ahead so Amy can start thinking about tasks today.

For some common themes I've noticed, yeah my pain scale Lego idea wasn't on scale. Stepping on a Lego was the funniest thing I could think of that hurts so I wanted to paint a picture. I wasn't making a clinical pain chart lol feel free to use your own theatre of the mind scenarios to help people without chronic pain have an idea of what it's like.

Also I don't understand the vague ""don't use the term CP"" comments sorry. In this post it means chronic pain. It's within that context 🤷‍♀️ sorry but I just don't get the issue here or of its upsetting...? Idk

Amy and Chad have both responded so we will see how today goes. Anyway this was my first break in my FT job so I have to get back to it.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Time for a chat with your supervisor and / or HR. Make sure you bring the receipts.

> **OOP:** The problem is that I don't have any other than what others have seen about her taking over my tasks. We were alone both times she confronted me in the parking lot and she showed me the video on her phone.

**Commenter 2:** This is actually insane behavior because what? Did we not learn about invisible disabilities? Or people who only need a wheelchair/cane sometimes and are ambitory users? This is actually insane work, who says that to someone? Especially when you’ve got the documentation to prove it. NOR OP. I hope you make a fool out of them because this is actually insane. I don’t know much about legal stuff but this seems like enough to take to HR if you have one. Seriously what is Casey on?

> **OOP:** Thank you I was really worried that my past trauma was causing me to blow this out of proportion so I was on the fence about it like maybe I'm just out of touch here.

**Commenter 3:** What the fuck!? NoR - you're *underreacting*

Info: how old are you both?? And what's the job?

> **OOP:** I'm 34 and she's 29.
> 
> The job is real specific but it has to do with the public school system. We have a lot to do with kids who struggle with specific subjects and help them in a way a tutor would but more fun if that makes sense.

**Commenter 4:** NOR - if anything you're underreacting to your coworker creating a hostile work environment. Does your workplace have an HR department?

> **OOP:** Not really HR issues are run through Chad's boss who is also basically the 2nd in command of the entire org

**Commenter 5:** She followed you to a bar to film you like a stalker. Let that sink in.

You need to go to Amy and Chad not to preemptively explain your situation but bc a coworker is so obsessed with your personal medical details she is stalking you, threatening to jeopardize your job and demanding you don’t use a mobility aid that you have proper documentation for (I.e. legal handicap placard). NOR.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/2FX46xyezf): **January 15, 2026 (next day)**

**AIO? My coworker took video of me outside of work to ""prove"" I'm not disabled - Update (Thursday)**

I was asked a lot to [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/vxAhYkRJHQ) when I got off work so here it is. 😬 Today was… weirdly quiet, which almost made it worse. Not sure what everyone knows but they at least know somethings up.

I wasn’t even in the same area as Casey during check-in and I have no clue when she actually arrived. I usually see her as our shifts are the same hours. Turns out she’d been assigned to the back office doing other tasks (hours reduced), while I was put at the admin booth at the entrance handling paperwork and spreadsheets (they definitely took advantage of because I’m good at it 🤣). So we didn’t cross paths at all at first.

I actually turned on a voice recorder app as soon as I got to work, just in case. I also added a shortcut on my phone so I can start recording quickly if I need to just in case. I didn’t wanna be caught off-guard like before. I did feel a little silly doing it, but I’d rather feel silly than unprepared, you know?

I didn’t see Casey until near the end of the shift, and even then it was barely a glimpse. She looked up, saw me, and immediately turned away. Like full on avoidance. It made my stomach drop. I just turned away and minded my business. Amy was very reassuring but also vague at first. I didn't like that and I think my face said so and she said she doesn't like all the red tape and such either but to be patient because they need to go through all the right channels and steps.

Amy let me go home early, but she told me to log my full hours anyway and made it clear she and Chad are actively talking about this and taking it seriously and I am almost certain she and he had been texting the whole shift. She also walked me to my car and said that will continue for now until everything is resolved.

About an hour after my shift ended, I got an email from her (Chad CC'd) saying that tomorrow (Friday), Casey will be assigned to admin duty in the back office unless something changes before the shift, and that we should not be interacting at all. It's a long weekend so I figure all the behind the scenes stuff will be happening then.

I also found out that Casey already “presented her evidence” That includes the video she showed me before and another video from yesterday (Wednesday). Apparently she filmed me at a local winery during Wine Wednesday (there’s a clip of me getting up to grab a bottle a few steps away, and later another clip of me standing up and doing a small little celebratory dance after a tabletop game win).

That’s the part that really messed with my head because hold on when did she start recording me? For how long?

I mean I could maybe believe coincidence once, like, okay lightning struck and its weird. Same town, same general area, blah blah blah. But twice, 2 different days??? Two different places?? That’s when it stopped feeling like my paranoia getting the best of me and started feeling… unsettling. I’m honestly starting to wonder if this is something that might need police involvement, as some comments suggested, and I hate that my brain even went there but I mean what other options are there right now??

I’m typing this from a bar right now, but not the same one as before thank god. It is still local to the school (teachers come here a lot) and it’s Thirsty Thursday, so there’s a bigger happy hour discount if you show your school ID. Joy is with me, and a couple other friends are on their way. Joy had been here during my shift in case I needed any backup fast.

That said, my head is absolutely on a swivel. So is Joy’s. I don’t feel relaxed the way I normally would. I keep scanning the room without meaning to and when people get too close to me or stand in any way facing me I look up to see if it's her. It's fucking weird.

I’m still trying to process all of this, and honestly I’m confused more than anything...I keep going back and forth between “maybe this is nothing” and “this doesn’t feel normal”

Right now I’m just documenting everything and doing what HR tells me to do, but I don’t like how small and watched this situation is starting to feel and I hate that I'm recording every moment I can in case she pops up.

If nothing else, I’m safe tonight and will be staying at Joy's...I’m not alone and work has made sure we’re separated for now. I guess we’ll see what tomorrow brings. So unless something crazy happens o won't be updating until this is resolved.

Wish me luck 🙏.

**Edit:** I just replied to a follow-up email answering some recurring questions HR asked... 

My answers al ended up centered around:

I have never directly or indirectly invited Casey out anywhere. We are not friends outside of work and have never socialized one-on-one.

I was also asked whether I feel safe at work. Right now, yes, because management has taken steps to separate us and has been present and supportive. I've yet to be alone at all at work. I’m continuing to follow their guidance and document everything as instructed.

I’ll update if anything materially changes, but for now I’m letting HR handle it outside making a non-emergency police report in the morning.

**Top Comment**

**Commenter:** She sounds more unhinged than originally thought based on the fact she’s filmed you multiple times. And refusing to understand that disabilities are on a spectrum. Especially with chronic pain. It doesn’t mean you’re incapacitated all the time or all tasks are equally difficult.

Keep us updated on what comes down the line as far as disciplinary actions by HR for her!

**Trigger Warnings:** >!racism!<

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/A2PSfBpMTk): **January 23, 2026 (eight days later from the previous update)**

Hey on my phone so sorry for typos

Happy Friday guys. Thanks so much for all the sweet messages checking on me. All things considered I'm okay. My pain spiked pretty badly this past Tuesday, so I took it easy and took off from my fulltime job to pamper myself. That gave me time to think and spend time gaming and gardening. That was a welcome break to brace myself for my part time job. So yes I have been taking care of myself and I loved all the reddit moms (and dads) checking in.

This will be long as I am trying nit forget anything so I can close this out (or at least put a pin in it) as I know for me as a reddit scroller, unfinished stories are almost as frustrating as the ones that go on forever. I’m hoping this is my final update on the matter.

Legal is now involved. I genuinely didn’t even know our organization even had a legal department but apparently it does and they’re looped in alongside HR. An HR rep has been communicating with me but honestly things have been very quiet on that front, which I’m taking as no news is good news.

I’m still at my school and I still love it. I love the students and faculty and even the parents (anyone in education knows parents can be great or they can be soooooo not great lol and rarely is there in between). Casey has been transferred to an admin position at an office in the company I don’t even go to. I haven’t seen her since my last post and I'm glad of it.

Work has been peaceful without her. I have more work to do now as the only assistant coordinator there but I'm starting to get my rhythm and the staff there has been very supportive plus I have more chances to get to know the people I work with.

What I didn’t expect was finding out (from multiple coworkers in several conversations) was that almost from the moment I joined that campus, Casey had been trying to spread rumors about me. Including suggesting that I’m a danger to kids or that I have an “explosive temper” which is honestly wild to hear about myself. I’m almost always described by others as soft-spoken to a fault and usually get told I need to be more strict with students. If anything I balance Amy out as the “good cop” to her “bad cop” plus the angry black woman tropes are sooooo freaking tired, so it was extra annoying to find out that she was trying paint me as such. She also said to people that the reason she took over my tasks was because I did them wrong or Madd her job harder and she had to redo things. She basically had a narrative that I was Mr. Magoo causing chaos and she was the saintly hard working teammate trying to clean up my messes so I don't get in trouble.

HR is still investigating, and I’ve been told to continue documenting anything that comes up. I’m ready to do so but so far it’s been quiet.

One unexpected upside is I’m now the sole person at my campus with my title, which came with a pay raise. Not how I would’ve chosen to get it but I’ll take the win.

I did file a police report - I think I mentioned this in my last post but if not I was told very clearly that filming in public places isn’t illegal and that there’s no reasonable expectation of privacy in those spaces, so there was no criminal action taken (cue my eyeroll but at least its officially reported). The report is strictly documentation. The local places I frequent have been made aware of the situation and that a report exists.

My friends were incredible, they helped me get my car cleaned and detailed just to be absolutely sure there wasn’t anything like a tracker or Airtag like some comments suggested we do. I also finally got around to asking my neighbor to help me install my other security cams. I used to have only one and my doorbell cam and now I can pull up live footage on the whole system all around my house. And to those suggesting a dash cam, I already have one turns out. I never used that feature, so my friends helped. My car is fairly new and I’m still getting used to it.

I did start to go over and backup all footage going back since I started at my campus by motion activation points and now have a hilarious compilation of the neighborhood cats being adorable or the crows I feed leaving random things lol (yes I did the crow mom thing). So another good thing came of this.

I’m not changing my routines... but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t still a little on edge. Especially since multiple coworkers mentioned hearing Casey blow up at Amy on her last day on campus and Amy sent her home for the day (this was on my day off as only Amy and Casey worked MLK day and the coworkers there volunteered to work the holiday for extra pay - time and a half). What she said varies depending on who tells it, but the fact that it happened at all doesn’t exactly make me feel warm and fuzzy as I'm sure you'll understand. But I tell myself everything that can be done on my end, has been done. So I try not to stress about it.

That said, I also reached out to a few lawyers just to understand my options. I’m very aware that HR exists to protect the company not me so I want to cover my bases. I meet one over Zoom at my lunch break so wish me luck.

I still record when I walk to or from my car. My therapist reminded me to be careful to make sure my being proactive doesn’t turn into living in fear and giving in to my anxiety or PTSD (past trauma). I’m taking that seriously as my mental health has been a journey and I don't want to go back to the way I was before. I can’t and won’t let someone else shrink my life again.

I do want to address recurring comments because I can’t reply to everyone individually..

""She goes to bars a lot - drinking is bad!""

Yes, I go to bars. No, that does not mean I drink heavily or have a drinking problem (what a leap!). I mean, look I’m disabled and I socialize within what my body allows and thats an isolating enough experience if I let it be. My friends (mostly able-bodied people) go to bars, so sometimes that’s where I go...

Sometimes I drink, sometimes I don’t...sometimes it’s a mocktail, sometimes it’s soda. I know my body better than strangers on the internet, to be blunt. For what it’s worth, my ex was an alcoholic and he was abusive and spiraled until it ended him so I promise I’m very aware of what that looks like and am probably one of the last people to be overly concerned about on that matter.

""How does she have time to work 2 Jobs and go out? Why wont she just go home""

I do in fact have time to go out after work. I work from home full-time and part-time with the school. If I go straight home after a long day I tend to just… keep working. I’m a workaholic by nature and going out helps me actually relax and not make my entire life about my job. I also intentionally line up PTO with most school holidays to rest and take staycations. This is me managing my health both physical and mental not avoiding reality.

""Don't go anywhere alone, OP""/concerns for my safety

Right now I’m both safe and supported. I’m cautious but I’m still living my life. q I’m choosing not to let this take over my entire world and this is supported by my therapist.

Thank you to the people who offered thoughtful advice and genuine concern ❤️ And to the folks who were weirdly judgmental....well, you must be an absolute blast at parties.

I’m hoping this is my final Update

Edit: the Ice storm woke me up and looked at my phone - Joy and my other friends have a group chat and I think they forgot which chat I’m on with them because they've been trading screenshots of Casey's social media. From what they gathered, Casey did put some of her socials on private in the past day or so but that didn't stop my friends from screenshotting some disturbing posts. In short, Casey has bought into the stereotype that black women especially ""steal from the government"" by leaning on welfare (such an age old and tired racist trope yet again) and other government programs and this included ""faking"" disabilities to ""rip off"" public programs because we clearly don't want to work /s

I did just forward this all on to the HR rep I am in contact with. Turns outs, this probably wasn't about my cane after all. Just plain flavored, canned racism without salt. Frankly how boring is that in my country 😴.

Edit 2: Joy I'd over with homemade Chili and news. No idea what to make of it but Casey is related to a higher up. Looks like a uncle/Neice. That could be another reason legal is involved but we're guessing at this point.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** The cat and crow compilation is a lovely side effect of something so taxing.

PS: If I understand, has your colleague been transferred? Or had her shifts adjusted?

> **OOP:** She works in one of the company offices now, from what I understand on an ""admin break"" - it's a reduced hour pause, I'm told and far away from me

**Commenter 2:** Sounds like you're on top of this, and hopefully you will live your life in peace after all the drama. It also seems like you have a healthy vigilance and not paranoia.

Good luck honey!!!!! You deserve a great life.

> **OOP:** Thanks so much! I'm hoping the same honestly. My fulltime job is aware due to the harassment/stalking and my boss this morning when I logged in checked in with me about it and said GOD I hope the rest is just so boring you'll struggle to even remember telling me anything new about it and I was like SAME

**Commenter 3:** So, Casey crafted a narrative without even knowing anything about you? What a whackadoodle. If she knew you’re Black and nothing else when she started these rumors, consider sending that little tidbit to HR and asking them to add race discrimination to your complaint.

> **OOP:** I didn't even think about it but dammit I might mention to Amy when I come in today
> 
>> **Commenter 4:** I've been following your posts about this situation from the start OP, and as a Black woman myself, when I saw you mention that detail in this update - the first time I saw it brought up throughout this saga - my first thought was, ""Ah, there it is!""
>> 
>> You don't mention Casey's race, but I'd bet anything she is not Black, she holds some unpleasant ideas about Black people, and ""proving"" that you're faking your disability was just a convenient excuse to get the office against you once & for all. I'm glad she's being dealt with seriously by your workplace - she sounds genuinely dangerous as a colleague.
>> 
>>> **OOP:** Yeah I didn't think about it that way at first so my flabbers are a bit gasted lol my job has a zero tolerance policy for racism especially in the recent political climate. Huge no no. Of my team actually, I am one of 2 people of color. Amy is Korean American. Everyone else is white, including Casey. Looking back...I feel like there were signs unfortunately

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Editor’s note: OOP made the post on r/legaladvice**

[Former coworker filmed me, was fired, and now I’m getting racist notes/messages. what can I actually do?](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Boysenberry_7535): **January 29, 2026 (six days later from the previous date**

Hi, I’m in Texas and honestly just trying to understand what options I have at this point because this seems to just be escalating and i feel like I’m not getting the help i need.

I posted previously in another sub, but things have escalated and people suggested I come here?

To summarize...I work full-time from home and part-time at a school. A coworker at said partime job (who on reddit ive been calling Casey) secretly took videos of me outside of work to try to “prove” I was faking a disability.

I reported this to HR first. Legal eventually got involved. She was put on an admin break, then moved to a different office, and as of this week I was told she’s been finally terminated. She has a relative (her stepfather) who works 2nd tier only to our Director, and he's also reached out to apologize stating that she is struggling financially and is a hard worker and thus was very stressed about getting a better paying position. I can copy and paste it below if needed.

There were snow days during part of this (Texas winter storms), so there was a gap where no one was on campus. I was told this delayed me from even logging on to my company email and seeing this info.

What’s happening now is that since she was fired, some really unsettling things have started around the same time. For example on Tuesday the 27th, I found a handwritten note placed on my car while it was parked outside my home. It included a racial slur (“n-b*tch”) and calling em selfish. I quickly checked with neighbors on either side and I was the only one who got a note. I checked my dash cam and moved a camera on my home to cover the area going forward. The footage from my dash only shows someone bundled up approaching the car, but no identifying details. As their face was covered and they were wearing like ski looking goggles.

Wednesday night the 28th,, I went to trivia night with a friend who drove us in her vehicle (she had ""snow tires"" on her vehicle and though the roads in our area were pretty clear we wanted to be cautious). When we came back to her car, there was another note with similar language left on her car! We went back and asked for footage but they said they didn't have cameras that worked out there. No damage to either car and we did double check during daylight just in case.

I’ve also started getting texts from unknown numbers beginning Monday that are hateful or at least pretty scary. I haven’t replied to any of them. I’ve muted the numbers (in case they text again) and saved screenshots for the police...I reported both note incidents and the messages. I was told that filming in public isn’t illegal..leaving a note without damaging property isn’t a crime, and the messages aren’t ""actionable"" unless they escalate???

They did take reports and told me to keep documenting which I fully intend to do.

Casey no longer works for the company. HR/legal are aware of the original situation. I’m documenting everything (dates, screenshots, photos). I have cameras and a dash cam. I’m not fully changing my routines, but I am being cautious.

I think that's pretty much everything...but ask me questions if needed and I will answer. So my questions are:

1) At what point does this become harassment or stalking under Texas law?

2) Is there anything proactive I should be doing now besides documenting?

3) Would a cease and desist make sense, or could that backfire?

4) Is there any civil option here, or is this realistically just “wait and see unless it escalates”?

I’m not trying to overreact...but the pattern is starting to freak me out and I want to make sure I’m handling this the right way and get the help I need to make this stop. I am almost certain it's Casey but without proof I'm not able to get any traction with the cops.

Thanks in advance

**Commenter 1:** If you go to anyone again - police, attorney - you need to condense this down to a few sentences.

You’re doing the right thing by muting these messages - do not block.

A C&D is just a “please stop” letter. That’s it. It’s not filed with the court (unless as an exhibit to a future pleading). Non-lawyers tend to ascribe powers to a C&D that simply don’t exist, or confuse it with a restraining/no contact order. You’re free to send one and she’s free to ignore.

Now, the fact that a letter was left on your friend’s car is obviously concerning because it suggests this person is following you. Have you found the owner of these phone numbers?

> **OOP:** That makes sense, thank you. I do have a condensed version written out for police/attorneys and I included the longer version here just to make sure I wasn’t leaving anything relevant out (I genuinely don't know what I'm doing here)
> 
> So far they all appear to be from different unknown numbers, and I don’t recognize any but they are all from then area code of where i live. Joy  thinks someone is using and then changing a google voice number. I haven’t been able to identify an owner myself, and I haven’t responded to any of them. I’ve just been saving screenshots with dates/times and adding them to my documentation and to be honest after a while for my mental health I don't read them all the way through, just screenshot and add to the folder of evidence.
> 
> And yes...the note on my friend’s car is what pushed this from kind of unsettling to very concerning for me as well. That’s why I’m trying to make sure I’m handling this correctly now instead of waiting for it to get worse...but the lack of support and really the attitude of the police is really disheartening

**Commenter 2:** NAL - But I do a lot of reading. This likely rose to actionable Harassment the moment she started things generally. But in my layperson opinion it DEFINITELY is now.

https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/penal-code/penal-sect-42-07/

Specifically 839 sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 & the same sections in 1118. As an aside it is very likely that someone else in her life is a co-conspirator under both section 6s.

Start the filings for a restraining order Yesterday.

> **OOP:** I am going back to police today as another incident occurred so this will be good to have in my vocabulary thank you!

**Commenter 3:** You also need to have your car checked to see if she's put a tracking device on it. Just to be sure check your purse or tote bag and coat also, since before her termination she might have gained access to them.

**Commenter 4:** NAL but trained as a victim advocate. Also from a different state so I can't speak about TX law.

As the other commenter said, continue to mute messages but don't block for documentation purposes. Document. Document. Document.

For something to be considered harassment, it needs to be clear and explicit that the behavior is unwanted. You would think getting papers with slurs and such would make it obvious but we were told to instruct victims to respond once then don't engage (unless there is already a restraining order in place- then you do NOT respond). Specifically, ""stop contacting me."" Continue to document everything and update the cops.

Harassment is difficult because it does require escalation before action. And if you can't identify the person (with absolute certainty), there are even fewer options. Depending on your location (city vs rural) a community-based victim advocate in your area may be able to assist you by explaining the options available for your specific situation. You mention working at a school- if it's a college there could be advocates on campus (info would be with student services or the title ix office).

I am truly sorry you're going through this. I hope the situation gets resolved quickly and without further escalation.

**Commenter 5:** You said HR and Legal are aware of the original situation, leading to her termination, but do they know about this potential retaliation by a former employee?  (I only say potential because she has not been caught red-handed, though I also believe it's her.)

They should be informed ASAP.  It's not happening at work and she is no longer an employee, but it is ""possibly"" related to a prior workplace issue.  The news about this continued harassment needs to make it to her stepfather.  I understand you may not be comfortable replying to his message yourself.  Even if he is only acting in self-interest and doesn't actually give a shit about you, he should be smart enough to know this needs to stop before it gets worse.  He can apply pressure and influence the police cannot (so far).  Would he do that, I don't know, but it might be worth a try.

I live in the Northern U.S. where we get frigid winters. I know huskies LOVE the cold but I swear I got an odd ball who is afraid of the wind and would rather be on my heated blanket with me than out in the cold. Unfortunately, this means I have to find new ways to entertain her other than bikejoring (I can't ski to save my life and we just started joring, so I'm worried she will pull me into the frozen creek near my house if she sees a deer or squirrel). I feed her using a slow feeder already, have snuffle toys, a metric ton of chew toys (nylabones, coffee wood, stuffed bones, etc.), kong toys, treat dispensers, tug toys, and squeaky toys, but I am struggling to keep her entertained for more than a few minutes. She is terrified of squeaker toys, only plays tug for about 5 minutes, can only repeat 3 tricks at a time right now before she gets bored of learning, isn't overly food motivated, and will only play if offered. I try to engage her, but it seems like the only time she wants to play is outside. Does anyone have suggestions on getting a stubborn husky to play or learn more?

Additional info: she is a 3 year old rescue who I adopted ~5 months ago. Her background is unknown, but I suspect she may have been a pet who escaped and lived on the streets for a bit. Doesn't like other dogs, so puppy play dates are out. She does like lounging, but I've noticed her attitude around my other pets gets nasty on days that she isn't well entertained/exercised. I do training currently twice a week with my trainer and attention is really her only consistent ask. Any advice would be great!!",1,1770267842.0,husky,2,1.0,False

For context, my bf is an extrovert but doesn’t like to maintain close relationships with too many people. He doesn’t go out as much, and he likes to maintain a strictly consistent lifestyle that doesn’t allow for leisure activities during busy times. He also stopped texting/meeting up with his female friends whom he was interested in before we started dating. I’m not too extroverted but I love going out, cafe hopping, drinking, karaoke, all that stuff. I don’t party, but I have the urge to go out no matter how busy I am, because I love having fun. I only meet with a friend or two at a time, and sometimes it will be a male friend.

I have personally maintained close friendships with guy friends before I met my boyfriend. They’re an important part of my social circle, we enjoy hanging out with each other, and there were never any romantic feelings involved - just pure friendship. Which means I sometimes grab dinner with one of them, drink with another, etc. just like how I do with my other girl friends.

My bf and I are dating to marry, and he stated that it hurts to see me hang out with another guy at night. He says having alcohol at night with a guy friend is unacceptable, but it’s fine for me to spend time with them in the afternoon or have coffee instead. I have already assured him that they are purely friends and I’ll stop hanging out with them after marriage, but he argues that if I can’t give up on this lifestyle now, there’s no guarantee that I’ll be happy living a more “mundane” life in the future. I’m personally enjoying my early 20s and hanging out with diverse friends, so I’m not sure how to handle this conflict. I would appreciate any advice that you might have for me.

Most apps start with chatting, sometimes for days or even weeks, before people actually meet. But honestly, that phase feels pretty exhausting at times.

She is very vocal about social justice (ICE, BLM, etc.), which I appreciate in theory, but in practice, it feels performative and, frankly, exhausting. A few things that are starting to wear on me, 1.) The 8:00am Politics. The second I walk into work, before I’ve even had a sip of coffee or fully woken up, she’s shoving an article in my face or launching into a heavy political debate. I’ve tried to hide my irritation, but it feels like I’m being forced into a ""consultant"" role before the workday even starts. 2.) Over-correcting on POC. She’s reached a point where she refuses to be critical of anything involving a POC. For example, if we’re watching a movie with a POC actor who is objectively giving a bad performance, she’ll insist they’re ""amazing"" simply because we ""need more representation."" It feels like she’s tokenizing people instead of seeing them as individuals who are allowed to be mediocre. 3.)She is the first to speak over everyone on global issues, but she doesn't actually do anything. No volunteering, no protesting, no community work. It feels like she uses these topics to signal her ""goodness"" to me rather than actually caring about the cause. I value her friendship and we ""agree to disagree"" on things, but I’m starting to feel like a project or a sounding board rather than a friend. It feels forced, and quite honestly, it’s making me want to distance myself.

Two hours later I'm shoulder deep in an audio patchbay, giving my senior a hand finalizing some *particularly* odd balanced-to-unbalanced-to-magic fuckery with a headphone amp. I withdraw after the panel I've been supporting is safely screwed in place, and sip my second coffee of the day. It tastes like a job well done.

Of course, T is for Tested, and so I connect my IT-issued laptop to the system and play some Crab Rave through it.

The sound comes out the laptop's speakers. Of course it does.

I double-check the audio settings in Windows. The option for headphone output is not there. Of course it's not. I double-check the connection is solid, and then opt for a reboot.

I sip my coffee. It tastes like impatience. *This worked fine last week.* A classic problem indeed.

The reboot finishes after a small eternity and I confirm that the system is indeed capable of handling Crab Rave. The recording engineers will be happy.

I sip my coffee. It tastes like disgruntled satisfaction. Time to play with some audio drivers.

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
An hour later I've found the culprit, and it is a very small and soft thing indeed. Microscopic, one might even say. Dell's audio driver on their website works as it should; no surprise there. Windows Update, in its inifinite wisdom, recommends a 'newer' driver that is nowhere on Dell's site.

I reinstall the old Dell-recommended version, defer updates for the next 14 days, and leave it at that. Hopefully Microsoft will stop recommending dysfunctional drivers by then, or IT will stop forcing normally-optional updates through domain policy...

I open my start menu, instinctively type the first few letters of ""Remote Desktop"" to check on last night's tape backups, and curse. Either Microsoft still hasn't found a fix for their broken start menu search after nearly six months, or IT hasn't bothered to deploy it.

Not to be outdone by Windows, I cast *WIN+R*, then follow up with an incantation of *mstsc*. I'll be checking those backups, thanks.

That driver definitely won't be an issue in 14 days. Inconcievable.

I sip my coffee. It tastes... doubtful.

I return from lunch nursing today's coffee no. 4. One of my users texts me as I'm returning to my desk - with a picture of a BIOS update running. Apparently he missed a fairly important meeting because his computer updated midday, and the update didn't finish over lunch because he wasn't there to enter the boot password and allow the update to continue.

I have him check his version number. Yep. 25H2. I check mine for comparison - 24H2 and no updates available. This should have been forced in the early morning even if he had been putting it off, not left until a random point midday.

I recall I've seen similar things happen on my end. Come back from lunch and the system is mysteriously off - power it on, and *surprise! BIOS update!* I typically check for Windows updates at least twice a week *specifically* to avoid them being forced. And yet...

I sip my coffee. I realize I forgot cream. It tastes like the colour of my soul.

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
I'm 'enjoying' yet another coffee after being told by some helpdesk L1 that no, network scanners such as Nmap and IPScan are not allowed, and no, IT cannot help locate a derelict server on the network (that nobody knows the physical location of), and no, that derelict server is not allowed on the network.

I sip my coffee - but I also don't, because that isn't allowed either. It tastes like *paradox*.

*Fine.* Shadow IT is is.

IT has made the mistake of giving me administrator permissions, under the assumption that Defender and domain policy will keep me well enough in line. *Ha.*

One short trip to Microsoft's website for PSExec later, lo and behold it turns out Defender is *completely* fine with Microsoft-signed executables regardless of what they may be capable of. I invoke Powershell as the system user, add Nmap's folder as a Defender exclusion, and smile. That'll hold until reboot at least.

Twenty minutes of low-speed scanning to minimize detection chances later, I have the IP of my old server in hand and can access its login page. It's a start. I'll ask the network admin later if he can get me the physical switch and port it's on, and see if I can find where the CAT5e drop goes. I have a good idea of where the wiring plans for the building are too.

I remove the exception from Defender and nuke Nmap - security first, after all. I can always re-add it if needed. Nobody needs to know, though who knows what IT logs.

I sip my coffee. It tastes like triumph. It tastes *really* good.

The user from before is asking for help. Normally I'd direct them to the helpdesk for IT-issued gear. Given how unhelpful IT has been of late, I decide a little more shadow IT couldn't possibly hurt.

It's odd, too - all the individual connections I have *within* IT are incredibly helpful, and typically offer other solutions when I create an XY problem from time to time. But whenever I try to use the helpdesk or ticketing system to do something the 'proper' way, I end up stonewalled or ghosted. And yet I have nobody to throw under the bus for it.

I discover the problem in short order. The user's port is VLAN'd to one of the lower-security networks in our org, and locks them out of the sharepoint, time clock, et cetera. The higher-security wireless also appears to be suffering at the moment, so the user can't make use of that - and IT never configured the user's VPN.

One brief trip to my desk and back, I've copied over the appropriate VPN settings (port, URL, etc). The user logs in with their creds, and confirms they are now able to access all the squishy bits inside Fort Knox via their wired connection. Perfection.

I've forgotten my coffee cup at my desk. Dammit.
