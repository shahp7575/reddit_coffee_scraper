**My [23F] best friend [24F] demoted me from Maid of Honor to wedding guest to promote my close college friend [23F] instead on the insistence of the groom [24M]. Am I wrong to feel upset?**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Biphobia!<

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8l2pdf/my_23f_best_friend_24f_demoted_me_from_maid_of/)  **May 21, 2018**


The relationships of everyone in this post with each other can be confusing, so I'll summarize those first:

• I [23F] have been best friends with the bride, Sarah [24F] since high school.

• I have been close friends with the new Maid of Honor, Carly [23F] throughout college.

• The groom, Andrew [24M] has been a close friend of mine since high school. According to the best man, he used to have a huge crush on me before I encouraged him to go on a date with Sarah. This was before he began to exhibit some concerning behavior (to be addressed later in the post).

• The best man, Tom [23M] is currently dating Carly and is Andrew's best friend. I introduced Carly and Tom to each other last summer.

I hope all of that makes sense! I know it sounds like the beginning of a high school drama (with the way this is all going, I'm starting to wonder if we're stuck in one).

Sarah asked me to be her Maid of Honor a day or two after she and Andrew became engaged. I was absolutely honored (heh) to accept and helped organize her wedding planning (mostly making sure that her various plans and dreams were filed correctly in the ""wedding file drawer"" and that she wasn't going too crazy with her budget/what she wanted to do). From the moment she asked, however, Andrew has been against me being the MOH. Why? He says it's because he doesn't want Tom to walk down the aisle with anyone other than Carly. It's ""so they match"" and ""because it makes sense.""

When Sarah and I both suggested that Tim can walk Carly down and I can walk alone, he vehemently refused to allow that as well, because I am single and it would ""make the wedding party look lopsided."" Andrew does have plenty other close friends who can serve as groomsmen, but he is absolutely stubborn when it comes to wanting couples specifically to walk down the aisle together. In his eyes, because I am single, I will make whatever groomsmen walking down with me feel awkward and if I were to walk alone, the wedding party would be lopsided. Therefore, I should just be a wedding guest and be happy for him and Sarah.

Sarah held out for a while, but it seems she's given into pressure. She messaged me about two hours ago on Facebook saying that she is so sorry but it hurts her to see Andrew so upset, so she is demoting me from the wedding party entirely and giving MOH to Carly. However, she will keep me as ""backup MOH"" in case something were to happen to Carly. An hour later, Carly messaged me very angrily saying that she DOES NOT want to be MOH. She does not know Sarah as well as I do and believes that MOH should go to either myself or any one of Sarah's family members (I have no idea what's happening with the family). She does not blame me for this happening to her, but she wants me to tell the other three to back off because they are not listening to her. And about half an hour ago, I received some more messages from Sarah in addition to messages from both Andrew and Tom begging me to reason with Carly and convince her to accept MOH.

I am absolutely tangled in so much drama, I am genuinely wondering if we're all back in high school. I definitely wish I can back out of this, but I also want to be there for Sarah and Carly, who have been with me at my lowest. I've made a two lists of reasons pertaining to this situation that I will also share here, in case it helps everyone put things into perspective.

Reasons why I SHOULDN'T/CAN'T ""reason with"" Carly:

• Sarah is my best friend, but that does not make my friendship with Carly any less in my eyes. If Carly wishes to refuse MOH, then why make her do it? She would likely be miserable.

• On principle, I am quite disgusted with Andrew's (and to some extent, Tom's) behavior. Talk about groomzilla! This is not the first time he's been controlling with Sarah, but this IS one of the worst times I've ever seen.

• Carly doesn't know Sarah will enough, despite dating Andrew's best friend. Double dates are few and far in between because Carly is in grad school and research lab all day for most days.

• They're all adults. They should sort out their drama themselves.

• I may want to stay the heck away from this mess, but I still want to be MOH, despite everything. I know, I am kind of pathetic.
• 
Reasons why I SHOULD reason with Carly:

• Sarah is extremely upset. Her messages have increased in frequency and in panic. The word ""please"" is coming up a lot as well (more than usual).

• Sarah is my best friend. I should be there for her and help her in any way I can. But I don't want to jeopardize my friendship with Carly either (see reason 1 above).

• It is Sarah's and Andrew's big day, and it is both of their choices on who makes up the bridal party.

• Carly and Tom do indeed look much more suitable as a couple than myself and Tom.

• I can help Carly fill in any gaps she has with knowing Sarah.

I have not messaged any of them back because I want to get all my ducks in a row before I take any further steps. Obviously, the things I can't do include magically getting a boy or girlfriend in time for the wedding (I would find that to be a very odd request anyways).

I am also worried that because both Andrew and Tom are so insistent on making Carly MOH that I have somehow compromised our friendship in some way without knowing. Both have gone on-record with their girlfriends telling them both that I was the biggest threat to their relationships after I came out as bi with girl preference (they're apparently convinced that I am in love with both women and want to steal them), but both women have brushed it off as them being ridiculous and possessive. Not only is this wrong (I am actually casually flirting with a guy from my school at the moment), but this upsets me quite a bit, as after 8 years of friendship with both Tom and Andrew, I am nothing more than a threat to their relationships? This might also be a contributing factor as to why I am feeling so apprehensive and indecisive about this entire situation.

Sorry for it being so long. I'm also feeling very anxious and stressed about this situation in general. It really does sound like some high school drama, doesn't it? Any thoughts?

tl;dr My best friend demoted me from MOH to wedding guest after facing heavy pressure from her groom. The newly chosen MOH doesn't want to be the MOH, so now groom, best man, and bride are asking me to ""reason with"" this girl so that she agrees.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**felinebyline**

>Tell everyone you're going to stay out of it and the bridal party is no longer your responsibility.

**OOP**

>>If I do so, would that mean I'm abandoning Sarah to ""fend for herself"" when it comes to her choices in the wedding? That is the last thing I want to do, as I still want to help and support her in any way I can.

**Nihilophile**

>>>Okay, so Tom wants YOU yo reason with HIS gf to be HIS partner in marching down the aisle? You do see that's crazy, right? I mean even apart from Andrew's thought that his choice of best man takes precedence over his bride-to-be's MOH AND there has to be a couple in the places of honor regardless of the wishes of the wishes of any of the women involved?

>>>Okay, even if we discount homophobia and patriarchal privilege, we're left with a groomzilla and his partner in crimes against etiquette. You are being so kind as to overlook your best friend's role in enabling all this, but the very last thing you should be involved with is coercing a mutual friend to go along with this reeking mess.

**OOP**

>>>>From the sound of his messages, it seems like he's already tried. I HAVE noticed lately that whenever there is something weird between him and Carly, he comes to me for advice regarding her. I've already voiced to him that it is weird and that he needs to be an adult and actually talk to the girl himself... but honestly, THEIR relationship is a whole other can of worms.

>>>>I've made up my mind from the other posters that, first and foremost, if I am to be a good friend to both Carly and Sarah, I need to refuse to coerce Carly. I AM NOT here to enable toxicity in our relationships. As much as it hurts me to have to hurt Sarah some more, I will not hurt Carly in addition to myself by trying to coerce her.

**DiTrastevere**

>>>She already has to fend for herself. Your presence clearly didn’t help if it just ended with you being kicked out. If your support actually made a difference to her ability to make her own choices, that wouldn’t have happened.

>>>You can decide whether or not you want to be there for her when her relationship inevitably turns toxic and she needs help. Until then, I’d take a big step back from this mess and let her find her backbone. Hopefully she finds it before the wedding.

**OOP**

>>>>Over the years, Sarah's backbone has been fluctuating a ton. She views her family as very controlling (something that I unfortunately don't know her parents well enough to judge) and her relationship with Andrew as her way to become independent. She stands up to her family, but not to Andrew. When we went on our senior year trip, she stood up to Andrew (who didn't want her to leave the country, ever) and went. I wonder what triggers the growth of the backbone...

**thedarkestbeer**

>""If Carly wishes to refuse MOH, then why make her do it? She would likely be miserable.""

>This is the correct answer.

>I think you should tell Sarah, ""I understand that you don't want me as MOH, but it still hurts. I don't feel comfortable convincing someone else to take my place, especially since she's explicitly said that she doesn't want to.""

**OOP**

>>I hope you do not mind if I borrow your script (with some modifications). Thank you. I think I just needed someone to kind of help tell me what to say and to nudge me back into line while my mind is so frazzled from all of these angry/panicked messages!

**&**

>>After a lot of thinking in a quieter environment, I've decided to attend as a guest. At the very least, Carly will have company if she and Tom are still fighting. And if Sarah needs me there because something goes horribly wrong, then I can at least try to show her that I'm still her friend despite the drama... short of her taking advantage of my kindness, of course

**~**

**rothbard_anarchist**

>""Both have gone on-record with their girlfriends telling them both that I was the biggest threat to their relationships after I came out as bi...""

>Does any other behavior from Andrew and Tom suggest that their own inability to see *you* platonically might be at the heart of this desire to get you out of the wedding party? The reasons you've been given don't seem the least bit realistic. What guy even cares about that?

**OOP**

>>The only thing I know is, back in our cringey high school days, these two were the sort to want to get with anything that had a B-cup or higher and breathed. I was in that mix, among other women at the school. Due to social awkwardness, no moves were made, thankfully.

>>However, the thing I am so confused at is that we're all adults now. They know that I am no home-wrecker and that when it comes to relationships, neither the ladies nor the ""gents"" are ""my type."" It's not like high school when it was all about our social status and gaining social status by having a SO. No one in the adult world cares whether I am married, seeing someone, or married to my coffee maker (and yes, I am).

**~**

**MoonCEL**

>Honestly I don't even know what you should do, but what I would do is just back out completely of the wedding and the argument. Sounds like the groom doesn't want you anywhere near the wedding tbh.

>Once your friend is married he probably won't let you talk to her anymore anyway.

>If the wedding is this contentious for them I can't even imagine what will go on behind closed doors and once they are married. What a sh*t show.

**OOP**

>>Sounds like the groom doesn't want you anywhere near the wedding tbh
I kinda wonder, since I am a guest now, if they've relegated me to that one table where all the people no one wants to sit with sit. Do you know which one I'm talking about? There was a movie about it starring Anna Kendrick.

**~**

**ihateusernames0000**

>How is this your problem to fix??! Don't let them put this on you, each of them is acting unreasonnably in their own way except you it seems. I'm sure you want to preserve the friendships so in your place I would send a kind message to your friend Sarah telling her that you don't resent her for demoting you but that you cannot and should not make Carly change her mind. Then remove yourself from this ridiculous situation by not answering any other messages about this issue (both guys sound like douches right now so don't even bother with them)

**OOP**

>>Carly is for sure going to turn down the MOH and I'm not going to make her accept it. It is against my personal code to coerce someone into doing things, especially if it makes them uncomfortable. I actually have trouble at times applying playful peer pressure (like shouting ""Chug! Chug! Chug!"" or things like that).

>>Things have quieted down... mostly because I silenced the chats that were still blowing up after Tom and Carly went quiet.


**OOP added more info**

>I know why her family is unsupportive of this marriage. My OWN family is not overly close to hers, but they have also occasionally voiced their concern. However, perhaps as a result of our upbringing or culture, all of us feel that it is not up to us to tell Sarah that she is making a mistake. The general view is that she is an adult and she makes her own mistakes.

>I wish more than anything that I can sit Sarah down and tell it to her straight: Andrew is extremely concerning and the fact that her family doesn't approve, even if she doesn't get along that well with her family, should be a huge warning sign. The fact my OWN family doesn't approve (my parents do not necessarily see her as a daughter, but they are the sort to voice their opinion of something in a single sentence, then never visit said opinion again) is also concerning. However, as I said before, something inside me tells me I shouldn't. Is it instinct? Or upbringing? I'm not sure.

**MioMioCola**

>>Look, I am going out on a limb and say that it is possible that 1. Sarah had some problems with her family and 2. Andrew is an abusive piece of shit.

>>That means that there is not much that you can do. People can only leave their abusers on their own, on their own terms and on their own free will. As long as Sarah doesn't see Andrews true self there is nothing you can do. You can't help her very much.

>>If she still means much to you, after the marriage you stay in somewhat contact with her. Andrew will try to alienate her from all of her friends, don't fight it. If Sarah is letting this happen she is not ready to leave this abusive situation. Maybe in the future she will grow a spine and leave him. Then she could use a good old friend.

**OOP**

>>>Until the day she does something truly unforgivable to me or someone I care about, Sarah will be my friend. This whole ""demotion"" hurts, but I get it. She wants her fiancee to be happy. She's going to a serious extreme to do it, but I get it.

>>>She had some problems with her mother in particular. Again, I don't know the family dynamics well enough to be able to judge. Whenever I was over years ago, her mother was always kind to me. She was one of those who offered to get me an internship with her company (a rather big one) and then a job. I found better prospects elsewhere, but Mrs. Sarah's Mom has been nothing but supportive. However, I don't know what she's like behind closed doors to her daughter. The only things I hear from Sarah about her mom is how controlling and unreasonable she is.

>1. I'd politely say that because you are no longer in the wedding party you do not want to get involved in wedding party decisions to both Carly and Sarah. If they get mad so be it because they are being ridiculous Even Carly should understand your hurt and not be putting this on you.

>2. I would decline being backup maid of honour. They made their choice. If they change their mind is say sorry I would prefer to remain a guest. If they kick you out of invite list than forget them .

>3. Your best friend needs to be less selfish and also should be dealing with her wedding issues alone.

>It honestly sounds like they are not good friends. I would step back and absolutely not be involved with the planning. Also.. of her fiance can't even compromise on her best friend being single and in party.. they are going to have huge wake up call in marriage. Seriously I'd work on making some new friends and being polite but slowly distant with sarah

**OOP**

>> 1. I understand your point about Carly, but I can also see where she is coming from. I think I would be annoyed too if I said no and yet people were still insistent. She's a venter when it comes to anger/annoyance and I'm always happy to help her kind of catharsis it out.

>>2. The difficult part of that is that I am afraid that if I back out, I leave Sarah alone. Her family does not approve of the marriage as it is and I'm terrified of what would happen if she does not have support.

>> 3. I don't know if she's being selfish. After all, she is sacrificing her first MOH choice to please the groom. That being said, she is also trying to use me as a mouthpiece, it seems.

**[deleted]**

>>>Carly.. I can understand is upset but she's not thinking clearly of your needs.

>>>Sorry to say but Sarah should be left alone on this if she is caving for him. Maybe the fact the family doesn't support it and he seems like a jerk make sense. Let her deal with her problems She Created Herself.

>>>Sarah is being selfish to expect you to convince Carly as well as using you as a back up. Seriously that's messed up.

>>>She's your friend so yea go as a guest but I'd distance myself from the couple. I would respect myself and not be a back up or sucked into someone's self caused drama

**OOP**

>>>>>Carly has thankfully seemed to have calmed down some. I think she's now directing her fury towards Tom... which means, thankfully, those two have been silent. Less stimulation and Facebook pinging means I can think more clearly.

>>>>I will admit, it did hurt that I've become a backup in the wedding. However, as others have alluded, perhaps it's a blessing in disguise. I've decided that I will use a modified script that another poster put earlier and try my absolute best to communicate that I am here as a shoulder to cry on, but that's the extent I will offer my help and support

**~**

**Gavroche15**

>Here is what I would do.

>First, let Carly know that no matter her decision you absolutely support her. If she is refusing MOH because she thinks you will be mad, let her know that you realize Carly had nothing to do with this shit show and won't hold anything against her regardless of what she decides.

>Second, let Sarah know that it isn't your responsibility to get Carly to conform to Andrew's desires. Tell her you respect Carly enough to respect her decisions and won't try to twist her arm. Let her know that you look forward to attending the wedding and cheering her on.

>Lastly, do not pick up MOH duties if Sarah asks. Actions have consequences and what she did was lousy!


**OOP**

>>Carly has made her refusal clear. She was actually planning on only attending one event (wedding or reception) because she wants to get a head start on her latest lab thing. The last thing I want to do is coerce her into something and have her miserable and worried about her experiment the entire time.

>>I'm offering Sarah a shoulder to cry on, because weddings can be stressful, but that is it. The good people here have reminded me that even if I back out of the wedding entirely, I can still be supportive.

**~**

**historicallyright**

>You may have already sent messages by now, but I first just want to affirm that NONE of this is your fault. These people are acting petty and dramatic which is—happily!—no longer your problem.

>Text to Sarah: I am so sorry that you’re upset. I know you’re making the decisions that are best for you, and I’m not angry about being out of the wedding, but I do need some space right now. Let’s talk in a couple of weeks.

>Text to Carly: I wish you weren’t in the midst of this drama and that people would listen to you. I’m taking some space from this entire wedding, so let’s talk in a couple of weeks.

>Then go find some less dramatic distractions, whether that’s other friends, family, or activities. The crucial part is to really mean it and not talk about the wedding at all or to any of these people for 2 weeks.

>Again, none of this is your fault. The best thing you can do for yourself is to stay as far away from the inevitable fallout as possible.

**OOP**

>>Thank you. I did send Sarah a message along those lines and, well, had to mute her for a bit because her response was overwhelmingly bad.

>>Carly hasn't responded, but I did apologize that she got dragged into the mess. I offered to share my good vodka and shot glasses with her whenever she needs to clear her head.

>>Finally, I have reached out to my other friends for a bar crawl. Currently, I'm digging around the fridge for some ice cream and am hoping that Netflix hasn't removed Once Upon a Time, because I've been meaning to give that show a shot.

It's just DIY basics. Didn't want to go in week one. Went to a coffee and cake event, at the same place, and left after 15 minutes (felt completely out of my depth). Forced myself to go this week (week 2). First week we were doing drilling and screwing. This week we've been doing planing and sanding and I had a realisation I was totally relaxed and calm sanding a plank of wood that I became overwhelmed with emotions. It felt like being back in Woodwork in school, when I was relatively ok with having a weird group of friends. I tried fighting the tears but I couldn't, but which meant I couldn't see what I was doing, so I had to withdraw from the group. 

Didn't think it would have this sort of an effect on me, but the last 9 months have been so difficult (blockage on heart, broke three ribs, lost my job and my mother in law) that the joy of a few moments peace of mind was just too much to handle. 

They were brilliant with me and very understanding. I'd urge anyone that has this locally to force yourself to go. You don't know where it will take you (which I know makes it tough) but I hope this might encourage you to try?

1kg5bax,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kg5bax/could_diletta_bello_espresso_machine_redefine/,Could Diletta Bello Espresso Machine Redefine Your Coffee Experience? Read This Review,"Owning the Diletta Bello Espresso Machine (item model number Bello) has been quite the journey for me, and I'd love to share my experience! Being someone who collects kitchen gadgets like some people collect vinyl records, adding this machine to my countertop had me excited and curious. It’s a stunning and solidly built espresso machine crafted by hand in Milan, Italy, which gives it an artisanal feel. For a semi-automatic espresso machine, it promises cafe-quality drinks at home, and I must say, it mostly delivers.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that drew me to this machine was its gorgeous appearance. Available in black, white, and polished stainless steel, it blends effortlessly with almost any kitchen aesthetic. I opted for the black powder-coated style, and wow, it’s a conversation starter. The build feels premium; stainless steel panels and a sturdy frame enhance its longevity. Weighing around 50 pounds, it’s no lightweight, so don’t expect to relocate it willy-nilly. The compact size (17.75"" D x 11"" W x 14.5"" H) allows it to comfortably fit even in tighter setups while still commanding attention.

**Learning Curve and Features**  
This is not your casual button-press machine; it requires a bit of finesse to get the perfect shot of espresso, which I initially found intimidating. Once I got the hang of the manual controls for espresso, steam, and hot water, I started enjoying the process more than I thought I would. The built-in insulated stainless steel boiler provides consistent water quality, which was a huge plus for me. But, if you’re new to semi-automatic machines, be prepared to invest time in honing your technique.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
The machine promises simultaneous brewing and milk steaming, and it delivers on that front. My mornings have transformed; I can quickly prepare cafe-style cappuccinos and lattes for myself and whoever happens to be at home without waiting too long. However, one notable downside is the warm-up time. While other machines in this price range heat up faster, I had to wait about 10 minutes before it was ready to use, which can feel tedious when you’re half-asleep and craving caffeine. My coworkers, who visited for impromptu coffee evenings, pointed out the pressure gauge was accurate, but the first shot of the day often felt underwhelming in terms of temperature.

**Eco-Friendly Timer**  
Activating the optional eco-mode timer was straightforward, though having to flip a switch located under the case for this setting felt a bit outdated. That said, the 60-minute automatic eco timer is great when you want to minimize energy consumption, so I grew to appreciate it despite the setup being less intuitive than I hoped.

**Advantages**  
- The machine is handmade in Milan, contributing to its unique charm.  
- Built with high-quality components that feel sturdy and reliable.  
- The E61 group head ensures proper heat distribution, preventing any uneven extractions.  
- Dual function lets you brew espresso and steam milk simultaneously.  
- Offers a stylish addition to your kitchen setup, especially in black.  

**Hurdles**  
- Warm-up time can stretch to 10-30 minutes depending on the drink, which I found cumbersome.  
- Quality control seems inconsistent judging from online reviews (leaks and heating failures).  
- Lack of a programmable timer leaves the machine behind other alternatives.  
- Bulkiness and weight may not suit smaller kitchens or mobile setups.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing this product to rivals like Breville’s Bambino Plus or De’Longhi’s La Specialista, key strengths and shortcomings become evident. The Bambino Plus heats up much faster, taking just three seconds to reach readiness, which is a clear advantage. De’Longhi’s machine stands out in ease of use with its more intuitive controls and sleek design cuts. However, neither matches the level of craftsmanship nor the aesthetic pizzazz of the espresso machine at hand. It feels like comparing a traditional vinyl player to modern streaming devices – each offers its own unique experience for different types of coffee enthusiasts.

**Smart Spending**  
This espresso maker falls into a premium tier of pricing, and considering its stainless steel finish, solid boiler system, and handmade construction, it’s clear that you’re paying for durability and quality. However, the additional investment for such features might be unnecessary for someone who doesn’t plan on experimenting with espresso techniques or making coffee daily. If you’re just looking for a quick cup of java in the morning, more affordable and user-friendly machines might suit your needs better.

I’m “Gold Verified.” I’m offering a girlfriend experience that’s centered around authentic connection, not just a transactional dynamic. I’m someone who truly values real chemistry and meaningful conversations that feel natural and fulfilling. This isn’t about “going through the motions” for me. Im not looking to play a role, I wont put on a show and not interested in playing pretend. I love to laugh, and I want someone I can really laugh with, I’m talking about that real - genuine - stomach hurts - spit your coffee out - type of laughter 😆 . A girlfriend experience with me looks like those kinds of laughs, often. It looks like having someone you can talk to, confide in, and share honest, genuine experiences with.

Let’s be real, “spicy” content can be bought anywhere and most of it is free to look at anyway lol. I don’t want someone who prioritizes that over meaningful connection. connection is the real luxury, here. I’d like to do this with someone who understands that, and someone who wants to connect with me emotionally and intimately. Yes, we’ll have an “understanding” - but I’m looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

Outside of this, my life is really fulfilling. Im career oriented, but in my spare time I’m probably enjoying an Italian dinner w/ family, on a hike w/ my pups, hitting the beach in the summer, binge watching a show, or curled up on the couch (in oversized sweats) reading a book or writing my novel. I thrive on good energy & spontaneous adventures. If you like a woman who’s full of life, a little bold, and always ready to lift you up, hey..we might just click. Im a social butterfly, but I also get along with people who are more introverted. It would be cool to do this with someone who matches my energy, but sometimes the best connections are the ones where opposites balance each other out. 

Overall..I’m down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind. If you’ve actually read this far, chances are you’re exactly the kind of person I’d love to hear from.

Hey! I bought my girlfriend this game and she's been absolutely obsessed with it. I thought it would be a nice surprise if I got it to play with her and we can show off our islands to each other. She's under a lot of pressure right now and I feel like that would make her whole week because she loves spending time together playing games and feels guilty when I just sit there with her instead of joining in.

This way, she'd be able to play the game she loves and also spend quality time with me. Plus, it looks like a nice little cozy game to wind down with. I could use that as well.

Currently, I've fully done everything in the cozy games I've been using to relax (Coffee Talk and Little Kitty Big City), so I've been devoid of that little unwind at the end of a tiring day.

From what I've heard and seen from playtimes, this game is similar to Animal Crossing New Horizons - which I poured 230 hours into. Thus, I believe I could really find a lot of enjoyment and longevity in this game as a cozy retreat.

As much as I love horror or adventure games, cozy games feel like a necessary addition to my daily routine sometimes, and I'm forever grateful for their presence when I have them.

**Why can't I get it?**

I recently bought it for her at full price, and I'm currently trying to save up to treat her to a little weekend getaway for our anniversary next month.

I can't afford to buy the game again at full price, especially when I'm having to pay for food etc on the daily. This is why I would greatly appreciate a kind gift of the game.

Thank you for considering!

Have never made a box, but have plenty of tools and am handy enough to do so. Help?","Might not be the right place to post this, I may try something like /r/DIY as well... but as the title states, I recently read a book that was specifically geared towards men and their grieving process, and how it differs from women. One thing it recommended is to use creative energy to ""give"" something to do the baby.

We lost our baby girl (Hadley) back in October of last year at 20 weeks. We have a 2.5 year old son, and are expecting another son now in September. It will be a boy, and we just had an in-depth 20 week scan that went perfectly (huge emotional milestone for us).

I'm finding that, as time goes on, I'm starting to experience ""rebound"" grief- the instances become farther apart, but seem to grow in their intensity. I guess you could psychoanalyze this and determine maybe I never fully grieved her in the beginning, or that it's more of a male trait or whatever, but after some therapy and deep reflection, I'm noticing it's there through some mental ""symptoms"" (anger, apathy, depression, etc). In an effort to try and get ahead of this, I've ramped up my therapy sessions, have started reading some books on the matter (and on life in general), have started to get back into a routine of physical activity (when possible, pretty tough with a demanding job and toddler), and want to direct that energy towards positive creativity. Making this box is perfect to me- I got very emotional last night just thinking about it.

I'm fairly handy- my Dad is a savant Jack-of-all-trades, and I've learned from him steadily over the years. I've built picture frames, coffee tables, and reboarded my back deck recently. I have a great Miter saw, nail gun, hammer/nails, etc. But I've never made a box.

Is there anyone here who can guide me in the direction of where to get started? Maybe a site that has blueprints for projects like this? I want this to be beautiful and very special, so while I could definitely figure it out from scratch, having a blueprint or at least starting point would be really beneficial.

I really appreciate any feedback- I've mostly lurked here since October, but this community has been pivotal to my experience and acceptance of the grief process of losing my sweet angel Hadley.",3,1746539792.0,babyloss,1,1.0,False
1kg53uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartShoppingHub/comments/1kg53uw/best_affordable_and_durable_electric_kettle_what/,Best Affordable and Durable Electric Kettle: What Should You Really Look For?,"Choosing the right electric kettle might seem like a simple decision at first, but once you begin comparing features like boil speed, temperature control, materials, and brand reputation, it becomes clear that there’s more to it than just boiling water. The core of this query revolves around finding a budget-friendly yet durable electric kettle, and determining whether certain premium features truly add value or simply inflate the price.

The importance of fast boiling depends heavily on your daily habits. If you’re someone who makes tea, coffee, or uses hot water multiple times a day, a quick boil can be a meaningful time-saver. Most standard kettles will take 3 to 5 minutes to boil a full liter, but high-wattage models can shave that down significantly. However, in practical terms, the difference of a minute or two may not be worth paying a premium if you’re only using the kettle occasionally. So while fast boiling is a convenience, it shouldn’t be the sole deciding factor unless efficiency is critical to your routine.

Temperature control is another feature that divides users. For those who regularly drink specialty teas—like green, oolong, or white teas, which require precise brewing temperatures—this function can be essential. It also benefits coffee enthusiasts who use pour-over methods. On the other hand, if you’re mainly boiling water for black tea, instant meals, or general use, then this feature might go largely unused. If you’re uncertain, a model with a few preset temperatures (rather than full digital control) can strike a balance between functionality and cost.

As for the build material, both stainless steel and glass have their merits, but stainless steel typically offers greater longevity. It resists cracking and is less prone to mineral buildup discoloring the interior. Glass kettles often appeal aesthetically and let you see the water level at a glance, but they’re more fragile and can be harder to keep clean due to visible limescale. For durability and low maintenance, stainless steel is usually the better long-term investment. Some hybrid models combine stainless steel with glass or plastic accents, but it's best to avoid those where plastic touches the boiling water if you're concerned about leaching or taste.

Brand reputation does carry weight, especially in the budget category. While many electric kettles share a similar base design and functionality, brands like Cuisinart, Hamilton Beach, Fellow, or Breville tend to invest more in quality control, safety certifications, and customer support. That said, there are also lesser-known brands that produce solid appliances—especially if they have strong customer reviews and warranty support. The key is to research not just specs, but actual owner feedback to assess reliability over time.

In summary, when selecting an electric kettle that is both affordable and built to last, it’s wise to prioritize sturdy stainless steel construction, basic but reliable performance, and strong consumer reviews. Only pay extra for fast boiling and temperature control if those features will see consistent use in your routine. Brand can matter, but not always in the way you think—it’s more about the company’s commitment to quality and service than the name on the label. Taking the time to match your kettle choice to your lifestyle will ensure a smart, satisfying purchase.

She got upset because I was refusing to share where I was going. That one hour quiet time was heavenly. No one called my name and I came back home so happy . When I came home my wife was furious! She said she wanted to check my phone then asked if I was seeing or talking to anyone. I laughed. I said I was at the library you can ask the librarians if they saw me. She has been really cold to me and says I should have shared my location since she does ( well I know she goes to the gym). Was I a jerk for refusing to share where I was? I decided to stay longer at work in future and take advantage of quiet office since now my wife know about the library ",10,1746539710.0,AmITheJerk,2,1.0,False
1kg521v,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1kg521v/selfimprovement_is_weird_actually_without_this/,Self-improvement is weird actually WITHOUT this,"I’ve been doing self-improvement for the past 10 years. 

Think cold showers in 2012. 

NoFap in 2013.

Traveling alone around the world to break out of my comfort zone.

Gained and lost 44 pounds of fat.

I’m not saying this to brag.

But only to drive the point home.

When I look back at the entire journey.

I do ask myself at times. What exactly was the end goal?

Doing all of this, what were I trying to achieve?

I don’t know at all. 

That’s the entire problem because I’ve been working on getting “better” without a clear WHY.

But here is something that has changed lately. I’ve defined a WHY for why I want to stop doing things or do things.

I was addicted to nicotine for an entire year, I could not stop thinking about it. But then one day I missed taking some nicotine and felt so more clear-minded that I wondered if the reason behind it was the nicotine.

So I tried it out, one day without nicotine.

It worked. But from that point, I stopped taking nicotine.

I had a clear WHY.

I did the same thing with coffee and food as well.

Anything that takes away from my focus I remove it. But I have a reason for removing it. 

Which helps it stick.

So although I love self-improvement. I think having a clear reason for why you’re doing this is far more important than simply just improving over time for no reason at all.

1kg51y6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kg51y6,TO Marathon - Debut,"Long-time lurker of the sub, here. Like many of you, I followed along for both advice and motivation throughout the journey and build-up to this distance.

To start things off: I (M/27) completed my first full marathon this past weekend! Despite reading a lot of negative feedback about the organization behind the spring marathon in Toronto, I honestly have no complaints. The course was fast and smooth, and the volunteers were amazing throughout.

I've been working with a coach for over a year now. The original plan was to run a marathon in September of last year, but injuries and illnesses derailed those plans. It had me seriously questioning whether my body could handle the stress of training alongside daily life. But with support from my fiancée, friends, colleagues, and coach, I kept going. While I couldn't complete a full marathon back then, I did manage to run a half-marathon while being sick with COVID. Pro tip: don't run while sick. It set me back by two months, and I dealt with several health complications afterward. Luckily, by December/January, I was back to training consistently.

A typical training week for me included:

* 4 days of running (1 long run, 2 easy runs, 1 tempo or interval)
* 1 day of cycling + strength training
* 1 day of cycling only
* 1 rest day

Peak weekly mileage hit around 65-67 km. Most of my runs were on the treadmill (I'm not a winter running fan), but I made sure my weekend long runs were outside. It was often in awful weather. That ended up being great prep for potential bad race day conditions. Still, the training block wasn't without setbacks. I got sick three times and was injured twice.

**Race Day**

**Pre-race prep:**
I carb-loaded two days before. Not anything extreme, just more carbs in each meal (an extra bun or more rice), plus lots of Gatorade for hydration and carbs.

* **Wake-up:** 5:30 AM
* **Breakfast:** Bagel with peanut butter, banana, Gatorade, and coffee
* **Race Start:** 7:30 AM
* **Goal Time:** 3:55 (5:35/km pace)

The weather was a cool 4-8°C, which felt great once I got moving. The first half of the course was downhill, so I focused on keeping my pace and effort controlled. I felt good enough to go faster, but I kept reminding myself that 32 km is the *real* halfway mark. Although I did positive split, I managed my energy well and stayed steady to the end.

**Fueling strategy:**
I took a gel every 5 km, alternating between SiS isotonic (20g) and SiS beta (40g) gels. The same as in training. No bonk, so it worked. I drank when I felt the need. I had to pee early on, so I held off on drinking during the first half. The urge eventually faded and thankfully so. I didn't want any bathroom breaks! For me, signs of dehydration are sore traps and abdomen, so I sipped Gatorade from my soft flask as needed.

**The Finish:**
In hindsight, I think I could've pushed harder at the end. Aerobically, I felt fine. But my legs were heavy and tired, so that held me back. My main takeaway: I need to focus more on strength training and possibly add a fifth run day to build leg endurance. I also think I'm fitter than I was able to show, so I'm excited to train for shorter distances this summer and chase some new PBs.

**Final thoughts:**
Really happy with the overall experience. The setbacks didn’t end up setting me back as much as I feared. One last piece of advice, if you're trying carbon shoes for the first time, don’t do it on a high-effort run. Test them on something easier first. I injured both feet two weeks before the race because of that mistake, and I thought I’d blown everything. Luckily, I recovered in time, but it made for an intense and aggressive couple of taper weeks. Physiotherapy is your best friend and I couldn't be more grateful for mine. I'm incredibly thankful for everything my physiotherapist has helped me through. Lastly, don't worry about your watch metrics pre-race. I had an elevated HR and HRV was tanking, but that was simply stress and worry on my end. If you feel fine, you're fine!!

1kg4zk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1kg4zk3/f4m_25_ph_looking_for_a_genuine_connection_not/,"[F4M] 25 | PH | Looking for a genuine connection not just attraction, but something real","Hi there. I’m just trying my luck on Reddit. Maybe I’ll find a buddy, a best friend, or even a lifetime partner. I know that’s a lot to hope for, but I believe the right connections often happen in the most unexpected places.

Other social media platforms have become overwhelming for me. People there seem to be more interested in appearances than personalities. I’m not saying I’m a head-turner, but I often feel like the attention I get is based more on attraction than genuine interest. That’s not what I’m looking for. I want someone who sees beyond the surface someone who’s drawn to who I am, not just how I look.

I’m 25 years old, slim, and in love with the idea of exploring. I used to go on solo road trips just to clear my head and see more of the world, but I’ve paused for now since my bike needs repairs. I still go on adventures when I can often with friends or just tagging along. I’ve gotten a little tired of being the one behind the wheel all the time. Nature is my peace: beaches, waterfalls, sunsets—they help me recharge. I’m a coffee person, a night owl, and someone who values quiet moments, but I’m also down for spontaneous plans.

I’m currently finishing my degree in BSED Filipino, and I’m a proud mom to a 5-year-old boy. I was in a long-term relationship for 10 years, but we’ve gone our separate ways. I left because I didn’t want to spend my life with someone who lacked direction, drive, or emotional maturity. I believe relationships should involve shared growth, real plans, and mutual respect not just being together for the sake of history.

I’m outgoing, talkative, and I love having deep conversations. I’m open to meeting people who are genuinely kind whether you’re looking for a steady friendship or a serious, intentional relationship. I’m not into casual flings. If I ever enter a new relationship, I want it to be built on trust, honesty, and commitment. My long-term plan is to work abroad, but if I ever meet someone who’s based in another country and who’s truly serious, I’m open to the idea of migrating and building a life together.

One thing I want to be honest about: when I’m struggling emotionally, I sometimes isolate myself. It’s something I’m aware of and working on. I just ask for patience and understanding I’ll always do my best to communicate and grow, especially if I’m with someone who makes me feel safe.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. Whether we become friends or something more, I believe good people attract good people. And if nothing happens well, no regrets. I’m just here trying my luck.",0,1746539444.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

1kg4xrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/attitudinalpsyche/comments/1kg4xrw/full_psychosophy_questionnaire_need_help/,"Full Psychosophy Questionnaire, Need Help Identifying My Type (Honest, In-Depth Answers)","**1. What is your current plan for the next 5 years of your life?** I don’t really have academic ambitions. My plan is to study, graduate, and hopefully get a job, even if it’s simple with a modest salary. What matters most to me is having some financial stability. That’s better than being homeless or relying on someone else. I’m pretty adaptable and can cut down on my needs to the point I forget I even had them.

That said, I’ve been planning to write a novel for years now. I want to do it properly, but I haven’t started yet because I still don’t feel ready. So for now, I gather information, reflect on my writing ideas, and imagine the scenes in my head. But I know that once I feel ready, I’ll write for hours, it happened before with a short story. My main struggle is perfectionism. If what I write doesn’t match what I picture in my mind, I get anxious. Still, I truly believe I can write something great. And while I am a bit sensitive to criticism, I welcome any feedback that will make my work better, as long as it’s actually helpful.

**2. What are your thoughts on language?** I tend to pick up on the meaning behind words pretty easily, which helps me sense people’s intentions when they talk. I try to be kind and easygoing in conversations. Language itself isn’t my strongest skill, but I want to get better at it. I see it as a way to understand people deeply and communicate with clarity.

**3. How do you find physical comfort?** I used to think I was neglectful when it came to physical things, like my room being messy or not brushing my hair. But over time, I noticed I do care about my surroundings and appearance more than I thought. I enjoy things like music, scents, coffee or tea depending on my mood and the weather. I work out sometimes, and I used to be good at karate as a kid. I don’t like sleeping less than 7 hours, it doesn’t even feel like I slept if I do. I enjoy shopping for clothes but not excessively since it’s expensive. Still, I sometimes waste money on junk food or small pleasures and regret it later.

**4. Are your feelings obvious to you?** Growing up, I learned to suppress my feelings as a defense mechanism. I thought expressing emotions was a sign of weakness. I buried my emotions completely until around 18. I was focused on studying and working to secure stability, but inside I was burning out. I tried to be perfect to avoid criticism. I saw emotions as mistakes.

That mindset broke me, and I realized that ignoring my emotions was taking me down a dark path. I’ve started learning to be more emotionally aware, not to show it outwardly, but to understand what I’m feeling and why. Now, I’m learning to accept my emotions rather than fight or deny them.

**5. How do you feel about authority?** If it’s just work-related authority, I don’t care, I’ll do what I need to and move on. But if someone tries to control my personal decisions or future plans, I push back. Sometimes openly, other times by blending in while secretly working on my own thing or finding a way out.

Should others listen to authority? That’s up to them. As long as it doesn’t lead to unethical or harmful decisions. When it does, I start feeling disgusted by the whole situation.

**6. Do you believe you have strong reasoning skills?** I’m good at analyzing things, connecting information, and spotting inconsistencies. I look at other people’s opinions too before forming my own. It’s like building a tower, it has to be stable. I constantly revise what I believe, especially when writing something like my novel. One small change can knock everything down, and I hate that.

Do I like arguing? Depends on my mood. If the other person is open-minded, the discussion might help me grow. But if they’re the stubborn type, I’d rather talk to a wall, at least it won’t give me a headache.

**7. Describe something you find aesthetically pleasing.** I like observing natural surroundings like the sea or weather. It helps clear my head, especially when I’m alone. My room has a color theme I really enjoy, dark and muted tones like brown, gray, black, or dark purple. When I buy things, I try to make sure they match the vibe of my room.

**8. Do you trust your internal reactions towards people?** Yes, I observe people closely and analyze their behavior. I don’t rush to judge, but I test scenarios in my mind, like, “what would this person do if that happened?” When I was younger, I used to actually create those situations in real life to test them. It was naive and sometimes hurtful, but I didn’t know any better.

Even now, I interact with people wearing a “friendly” mask. Everything I say is calculated, not because I’m fake, but because I don’t want to hurt others or get hurt. I keep some distance emotionally. When someone gets too close, I get scared. I don’t really care about emotional bonds or even friendship, I’m comfortable in my isolation. And that makes me feel guilty sometimes, so I try to be kinder to others.

**9. How does it feel to think of the future?** My priority is stability. So when I feel unstable in the present, I get pessimistic about the future. I try to focus on the present and make decisions that could improve things long-term. For me, living a quiet life, away from noise and pressure, is my idea of success.

That doesn’t mean I’ve given up on my dreams, like writing my novel. But I don’t chase after status or climb some metaphorical ladder. That would exhaust me. I try to stay focused on what really matters to me.

**10. How do you organize information?** Building systems and structure is essential to me, it keeps me from feeling overwhelmed. It’s mostly mental, not written down. I like reviewing things multiple times to make sure everything fits. One of the best feelings is learning something new and realizing it fits perfectly into what I already know, like finding the missing puzzle piece.

**11. Do you have a daily routine?** I don’t follow a rigid routine, but I do have priorities. Things like studying, reading, or working out (if I’m back into it) come first. Then there are side activities like hobbies or self-improvement. If I do it all, that’s an ideal day. If I just cover the basics, I still feel like I’m making progress. But if I spend the day on meaningless stuff, I feel guilty and try to make up for it later.

I don’t like giving up my time for others, but sometimes I have to. So when that happens, I try to handle it quickly and then refocus on my priorities. I adjust and move on.

**12. Describe one of the best moods you have ever been in. And the worst.** The worst period I went through was between the end of high school and the start of university. I was under intense internal pressure, torn between others’ expectations and suppressing my own emotions. I pushed myself too hard to seem perfect and ignored any sign of vulnerability.

As for the best mood I’ve been in, I realized it doesn’t come from achievement or success, but from the simplest moments — reading a book in dim lighting, drinking coffee in a quiet cold room, silent reflection, or going on a calm walk with family. These moments bring me a kind of peace that feels priceless. Sometimes I’d think to myself, if my whole life was just this moment, I’d be perfectly content.

**13. What is your greatest strength?** I’d say my strengths are gathering and refining information, adapting to different people and environments, and a constant curiosity to try new things and hobbies — even if I don’t stick with them. Once I decide to do something, I want to do it as well as possible. I hate doing a half-baked job.

This drive for quality makes me analyze things deeply, connect ideas, and ensure everything is grounded in a solid framework. I don’t force myself into conversations, but when I do speak, it comes from real understanding and thought — not just random opinions.

**14. In what ways are you resilient? Are you an inspiration to others?** I’ve gone through harsh mental pressure and suffocating external expectations, but I never truly gave up. I processed things silently, tried to absorb the pain instead of sinking into it. I do break down sometimes, but I don’t let it stop me for good. I recover slowly, but I always move forward.

I don’t think of myself as an inspiration directly. But when someone asks me for advice or support, I offer what I’ve learned honestly, no sugarcoating. I think my perspective helps others see things they may have overlooked.

**15. What is your biggest fear?** I’m afraid of being incompetent or losing my independence and ending up relying on others. That fear made me obsessed with perfection, trying to prove to myself I can handle life on my own. I used to think that losing just two marks on a test would ruin my whole future. That mindset came from my family, but I made it worse myself.

I also fear disappointing people, which sometimes leads me to agree to things I don’t actually want. Lately I’ve been learning how to say “no” clearly and draw boundaries, even if it disappoints someone. I don’t want to be a bad person, so I try to be kind and thoughtful. But I have strong self-criticism and that makes it hard to move forward.

**16. What feels like a waste of time to engage in?** Anything outside of my interests feels like a waste of time — shallow conversations, unnecessary social events, weddings, small talk. Even long talks with my father can feel draining sometimes, because his focus is always on material things I don’t really care about.

He asks what I want in life, but I don’t even know myself. I’ve tried setting big goals before and failed. Now, I don’t want to exhaust myself with fake optimism. I’d rather say I did my best and accept whatever comes.

Writing my novel is a perfect example of this. If I fail, I’ll be okay — what matters is that I gave it everything I had.

**17. Are you a leader? What qualifies or disqualifies you as one?** I rarely take the lead, and I prefer to support or collaborate. I might step up if no one else will or if I’m clearly the most capable. But I don’t chase leadership and it doesn’t come naturally to me. Leading drains me, especially if I don’t care about the task.

I’m observant and often figure out what needs to be done and guide things quietly, whether through words or subtle direction. In group settings, I’m more comfortable when there’s a mutual exchange — I offer what I’m good at and ask for help with what I’m not. I sometimes push boundaries gently to help others, but I don’t impose myself. I prefer gradual influence that doesn’t feel intrusive.

I choose to collaborate with people who are useful or skilled. But when someone’s good at everything, I honestly don’t know how to interact — I don’t know what I can give them.

**18. When do you feel the most collaborative with others?** I’m most collaborative when there’s a clear give-and-take, where both sides know they have something to offer. I don’t like being a follower, but I also don’t want to be the one controlling everything. I prefer working with people who value effort and respect boundaries.

That said, I usually lean toward working alone. I like clear environments without noise or distractions. But I know being closed off can hurt me long-term, so I cooperate when I need to. If I’m expected to work with others, I’ll do it. If I’m expected to be more social, I’ll manage. But I’ll always feel more at peace when I’m allowed to be in my own space.

**19. Do you overcome doubt and hesitance? Explain why or why not.** Most of my decisions go through a phase of hesitation. I overanalyze and think about all the consequences. Sometimes fear of failure holds me back. But what helps me push through is believing that not deciding is worse than making an imperfect choice.

I see doubt and hesitation as something I have to sit with, not avoid. In the end, I usually act, even if it takes time. Sometimes I follow inspiration or intuition when logic hits a wall.

I’m still learning to be more decisive, but I’ve made a lot of progress in accepting hesitation as part of who I am, not a flaw.

**20. Do you yield to others? If so, in what situations do you do this? How do you feel about it?** Yeah, I tend to give in a lot because I hate conflict. That really frustrates me. Sometimes I let things go just to avoid arguments. But if someone keeps pushing or crosses a line, I might eventually snap and let everything out at once.

That’s why I started avoiding direct emotional honesty. Instead, I express frustration through sarcasm or light criticism — it gets the point across without a full confrontation. I’ve also started setting clearer boundaries and being more stubborn when someone tries to overstep.

Still, if I can escape conflict without it repeating again, I’ll take that path, even if it hurts my pride. Most of the time, I let go of arguments because I know they’ll go nowhere and I have better things to focus on.

**21. What are you looking to get out of the typing process? Do you have ideas for your type(s)?** Honestly, I’m not sure what I want exactly, other than finding a type that truly describes me. I’m looking for a deeper understanding of myself — something that actually reflects who I am inside.

I’ve written about myself before and others tried to type me, but I didn’t express myself well enough in those attempts. Some of the types I’ve been given are VLFE or VLEF. My current guesses are LVEF, LVFE, LFEV, or LEVF — and maybe LEFV, though that one feels like a stretch.

In January of 2023, I was 234lbs (6'0""), and I decided to give up ""bulking"" (wasn't going well, obviously) and stop trying to lift the heaviest things possible. I wanted to get healthier, watching a loved one's health decline and ultimately passed away just a few months later. I decided to take control and get healthy while I still could, being in my early 30s still. 

I began doing probably what you'd refer to as a ""bro split"" - chest/tris Monday, back/bis Tuesday, shoulders Thursday, and then a mix of Monday/Tuesday on Friday (but with different lifts). Yes, I mostly skipped leg day at the time. 

I started cleaning up my diet, cutting out foods I was picking on at the time, and just eating ""better."" For what it's worth, I've always weighed out my food, for years now, but haven't always stuck to a specific caloric intake.

We'll skip to October of 2024 because this is when things started going crazy. My significant other brought up a ""diet"" she found on TikTok of all places. I was never into the whole trendy diet thing (shocker!), but I gave it a shot with my own twist. It's called ""animal based,"" sorta like Carnivore, but again, I adjusted it to how I find it most beneficial for me. 

I now eat: fruit, greek yogurt, eggs, ground beef, chicken, protein shakes - that's it - besides the once every couple weeks cheat meal. I still have a Dunkin coffee (maybe twice a month), energy drinks, diet soda, etc, all very occasionally. I'm not looking to become a body builder, just a shape that I can be proud of. No ab work yet. 

Lifts were generally the same. I always shoot for progressive overload. Always write down what I do week in and week out. No cardio yet.

I still weigh food, but I have no idea what my macros are. I can easily tell you if I stop being lazy and calculate, but whatever. If anyone wants to know, I'll provide. Important to note - I haven't changed my diet once from 200lbs to today at 184lbs. I eat the same thing every day - literally.

Meals:

Pre workout - banana, greek yogurt cup  
Post workout - 2 scoop protein shake  
2 hours later - greek yogurt cup  
Lunch - 5.5oz ground beef, 2 eggs, ketchup  
2 hours later - random amount of carrots  
Dinner - 5.5oz ground beef, 2 eggs, ketchup (definitely animal based ketchup, I swear!)  
1 hour later - 100g blueberries, some amount of strawberries, some amount of cantaloupe  
\*very scientific!\*

On October 11th, 2024, I was 200lbs - as of last weigh in day, 5/3/25, I was 184lbs. As of February of this year, I finally began doing cardio (3-4 days/week) as I prepare for the state police academy. So far my best 1.5 mile time, outside, is 12 minutes, 20 seconds. I just started working out abs the last couple months, doing mostly ab roller and very strict hanging leg raises. So far my best is 21 in a row!

Starting next week, I'm going to get more ""scientific"" I guess you can say with my workout routine and do a proper PPL program, once I can put one together that suits my needs. I'm trying to cater my entire workout style to prepare for academy, but even still, I'm obviously in the dark as to how intense that's going to be.

Anyway, that's me done rambling. I know it's not much, but it's honest work. Completely natty, probably obviously. I ran a couple cycles probably 8-10 years ago, but never again.

I'm not sure what I expect, response wise, but I have a feeling people are gonna wild on me lol. I know I could do better, but this entire lifestyle has been SO easily sustainable. I could put myself in a bigger deficit but I've continuously lost weight month over month for the most part without changing really anything. Now that I've added cardio, I see body changes basically week over week as well.

Anyway again, this was a way bigger story than I thought it'd be, but hey, I mentioned a workout routine I'll be starting next week, so if anyone has tips/advice or anything regarding PPL, I'm all ears! The plan is 6 straight days, PPLPPL. If you made it this far, nice work!",3,1746539268.0,WorkoutRoutines,0,1.0,False

1kg4w2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1kg4w2x/why_net_migration_tops_your_dev_agenda_how_why/,"Why .NET Migration Tops Your Dev Agenda: How, Why & Top Tips for a Seamless Move","If you’ve ever found yourself googling “.NET upgrade best practices,” “legacy to .NET Core how-to,” or “benefits of .NET migration,” you’re not alone. Developers, CTOs and business owners alike are on the hunt for clear guidance on moving legacy apps to modern .NET platforms. In this deep‑dive, we’ll unpack the “why,” the “how,” and top tips to make your migration as smooth as a well‑tuned regex.

# Why Migrate to Modern .NET?

**1. Performance Gains & Scalability**  
Shifting from .NET Framework 4.x to .NET 6/7 (or later) can yield 20–30% faster request throughput, lower memory usage, and cross‑platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS). If you’re still on an old monolith, you’ll feel like you’ve upgraded from a flip phone to the latest smartphone.

**2. Long‑Term Support (LTS) & Security**  
Microsoft’s LTS releases guarantee patch support for 3 years. No more frantic Fridays chasing zero‑day patches. You get predictable maintenance windows, security updates, and peace of mind—just what business owners love when outsourcing to teams like Abto Software.

**3. Ecosystem & Tooling**  
From the CLI (`dotnet new`, `dotnet ef migrations add`) to built‑in DI and unified SDK, modern .NET eliminates the Franken‑code scenario. One runtime, one SDK, one way to build. Tools like Visual Studio, VS Code and Rider all speak the same language, so your outsourced devs hit the ground running.

# How to Plan Your .NET Migration

# 1. Audit & Inventory (the “regex” approach)

Begin with a regex‑style scan: list all projects matching `*.csproj`, identify deprecated NuGet packages (e.g., `Newtonsoft.Json` → `System.Text.Json`), and flag APIs absent in .NET 6+. Treat your codebase like text in a log file—search for `#if NET48` directives or `AppDomain` calls, and mark them as red flags.

# 2. Establish a “Strangler Fig” Pattern

Don’t rip out the monolith overnight. Implement a Strangler Fig pattern: carve off modules (e.g., Reporting or Auth) into new .NET services. Redirect traffic gradually. You get incremental wins, measurable ROI, and a fallback plan if things go sideways.

# 3. Prioritize LTS & Compatibility

Focus on LTS releases (now .NET 6), then plan upgrades to .NET 8/9 when they reach LTS. Use the `.NET Upgrade Assistant` for automated project file updates and API compatibility checks. It’s not foolproof, but it catches 80% of the tedious work.

# Top Tips for a Smooth Move

1. **CI/CD First**: Automate builds & tests on GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. Break your pipeline into “restore → build → test → publish & deploy.” This way, every PR validates your migration progress.
2. **Leverage Containers**: Dockerize both old and new apps. Use multi‑stage builds to keep images slim. Swapping containers beats wrestling with IIS configs any day.
3. **Performance Baseline**: Benchmark before and after with tools like BenchmarkDotNet or Apache JMeter. Capture metrics (latency, RPS) so you can prove the value of the migration to stakeholders.
4. **Remote Pair‑Programming**: When working with outsourced teams, carve out time for pair sessions. Screen‑share refactoring chores—knowledge transfer is as important as code transfer.
5. **Stay Modular**: Favor NuGet packages for shared components (e.g., Logging, Data Access). Version them separately and avoid “DLL hell.”

# Business Owner Lens: Outsourcing & ROI

For execs eyeing outsourcing, .NET migration is prime territory. Why? It’s a greenfield on brownfield code—complex enough to justify expert dev rates, yet structured so deliverables are measurable. Partnering with a team like Abto Software means:

* **Domain Expertise**: They’ve seen 100+ migrations, know the pitfalls (binding redirects, reflection woes) and pre‑built scripts to dodge them.
* **Cost Predictability**: Transparent T&M or fixed‑bid models eliminate scope creep.
* **Speed & Quality**: With CI gates and code reviews, deadlines are met without sacrificing stability.

# A Little Humor: Why You’ll Love .NET Migration

>

…Okay, maybe it’s more like upgrading your morning coffee from instant to a pour‑over: subtle, but you’ll wonder how you lived without it.

# Wrapping Up: The Regex of Success

Your migration journey will involve lots of search‑and‑replace steps: updating package refs, tweaking `Startup.cs` to `Program.cs`, and rewriting legacy WCF clients to gRPC or REST. Approach it like a big regex exercise—plan your patterns, test your replacements, and commit early, commit often.

Whether you’re a seasoned dev wielding code like a scalpel or a business owner lining up outsourced talent, a strategic .NET migration is a win‑win. It future‑proofs your apps, boosts performance, and unlocks new cross‑platform possibilities. And if you need a partner who eats migrations for breakfast (and has a mean regex game), Abto Software is ready to dive in.

Also, how do you guys handle sweet cravings? Usually, I would just pour some coffee that’s already in the pot (since everyone in my house drinks it and it’s always there) and snack on chocolate or cookies, but now I need an alternative that will be as pleasing.

From customer support chatbots to data‑scraping crawlers, AI agents are transforming workflows. But why should developers and businesses care? And how do you actually build one that doesn’t crash and burn on day one? Here’s an 800‑word deep dive, sprinkled with regex nicknames and industry insights (we even peeped top Google searches like “AI agent frameworks,” “best AI agent dev tips,” and “AI agent outsourcing”).

# Why AI Agents Are a Game‑Changer

1. **24/7 Automation Without Coffee Breaks** Humans need caffeine; AI agents don’t. They can monitor logs, auto‑respond to tickets, or trigger dev‑ops scripts around the clock. Think of it as your always‑on intern with zero salary demands.
2. **Scalability on Demand** Spikes in traffic? No problem. Spin up more instances of your agent—just like scaling web servers. If your regex for load is `^ERROR.*`, have the agent notify you as soon as it matches.
3. **Data‑Driven Decisions** Modern AI agents pair NLP, vision, and structured‑data analysis. Selling shoes online? An agent can scan reviews, extract sentiments with a simple pattern like `(good|great|bad|terrible)`, and feed insights back to marketing.

# What Developers Really Ask on Google

* **“How to choose an AI agent framework?”** You’ll see mentions of Rasa, Botpress, and LangChain. Each has trade‑offs in customizability vs. out‑of‑the‑box NLP.
* **“AI agent vs. chatbot: what’s the diff?”** Short answer: chatbots are humans‑inspired dialog systems; AI agents can be multi‑modal, execute actions, and chain tasks.
* **“Outsource AI agent dev: pros & cons”** Companies search for “offshore AI developer rates” or “hire AI plugin developer.” Key concern is quality assurance and communication.

By addressing these, we ensure our content hits those sweet search spots.

# How to Architect Your AI Agent: Core Components

Rather than listing dozens of bullet points, let’s analyze the anatomy of a robust AI agent:

1. **Perception Layer**
   * **Text Input**: NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT‑style) turn raw text into embeddings. Use libraries like Hugging Face Transformers; regex remains handy for quick preprocessing, e.g., `re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text)`.
   * **Vision/Input Streams**: If your agent needs to “see” (e.g., screen‑capture for QA bots), integrate OpenCV or Tesseract OCR.
2. **Reasoning Engine**
   * **Rule‑Based Logic**: Classic finite‑state machines or decision trees. Great for predictable workflows.
   * **Learning Module**: Reinforcement learning or active learning loops to adapt over time. Beware of reward‑hacking—your agent shouldn’t spam your alert channel just to “win.”
3. **Action Layer**
   * **API Calls**: REST or gRPC to external services.
   * **System Commands**: Shell scripts, container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes Jobs). Use safe patterns like whitelisting commands via `^kubectl\s+(get|apply)\s+`.
4. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   * Telemetry (Prometheus/Grafana) to visualize performance.
   * Continuous testing pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to catch regressions.

# Top Tips for AI Agent Development

* **Tip 1: Start Small, Iterate Fast** MVPs aren’t just jargon—they save hours. Build a PoC that reads an email, extracts tasks using `(TODO|FIXME):\s*(.*)`, and logs them. Then expand.
* **Tip 2: Embrace Modular Design** Treat perception, reasoning, and action as separate microservices. If your reasoning logic changes, you shouldn’t have to retrain your entire vision model.
* **Tip 3: Prioritize Explainability** Especially in regulated industries (finance, healthcare), you need to trace why an agent made a decision. Log every input/output pair, and consider SHAP values for model interpretability.
* **Tip 4: Secure Every Layer** Don’t expose your agent’s management API without auth. Use JWTs, OAuth2 flows, or mTLS between components. A misconfigured AI agent can be a hacker’s backdoor.
* **Tip 5: Outsource Wisely** If you’re juggling product roadmaps and lack AI expertise, partnering with an outsourcing specialist can jump‑start your project. We’ve seen teams cut time‑to‑market by 30% by tapping into skilled offshore developers. For example, Abto Software has a dedicated AI practice that helps clients design, build, and maintain AI agents—from initial PoCs to full‑scale deployments—ensuring code quality, documentation, and seamless integration.

# Why Outsourcing AI Agent Development Makes Sense

* **Access to Niche Talent**: AI engineers, data scientists, and MLOps experts are in high demand. Outsourcing firms often have bench strength to fill gaps.
* **Cost Predictability**: Fixed‑scope contracts or dedicated teams let you forecast budgets accurately.
* **Faster Ramp‑Up**: Onboarding external teams with proven workflows avoids the hiring pipeline headache.

Just be sure to vet portfolios, check references, and run pilot sprints. Ask potential partners for case studies: “Show me a regex‑driven preprocessor you built,” or “How did you integrate GPT‑style models into a CI/CD pipeline?”

# Final Thoughts

AI agent development sits at the crossroads of software engineering, data science, and DevOps. Whether you’re a solo developer or a CEO scouting for outsourced talent, mastering the why, what, and how is crucial. Remember the regex mantra: validate inputs, iterate quickly, and modularize ruthlessly. And when it’s time to scale, consider a partner like **Abto Software** to keep your project on track, free you from micromanagement, and deliver production‑ready agents that earn their keep.

So I met this girl for dinner. Technically, we had
planned coffee, but since the timing worked out to be around 8:30–8:45 PM, I picked a place that served food too—didn’t want either of us going hungry.

She waited at the entrance, sweet, polite—good start. We sat, I asked her to go ahead and order. She said she had snacks just an hour back and was too full to eat much. Fair enough. I insisted we at least share something, so I ordered Manchurian. She took *one* piece. The remaining four? Yours truly—awkwardly but hungrily—ate them all.

That aside, the conversation flowed well. We talked about a lot—life, work, people she’d met before, her perspectives. Felt natural, no awkward silences. Around 10:30 she got a call from home, and we wrapped up. She didn’t want a drop-off, so I texted her later to say it was nice meeting her and to check if she reached safely.

Next morning, I messaged again to ask how she felt about the meet. She said, *“I liked your nature and the way you are, but I need some time to think.”* Cool. I respected that.

A week later, I checked in again with a casual text. Same response—she needed more time. So I asked directly, “Should I move on or wait?” Her reply: *“You shouldn’t wait for me to decide.”*

And that’s where it hit me. If you already know something isn’t working or clicking, just say it. Don’t keep the other person on read, on hold, or in limbo. Respect works both ways.

Truth is—people often don’t know what they want. But instead of being upfront, they leave things open-ended like it's some ""maybe-later"" shopping cart.",13,1746538966.0,Arrangedmarriage,2,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many good designers, they make very nice websites. Still, no new work comes to them. This is a sad thing. Why does this problem happen so often? Perhaps the way they show their **creative web design** is not strong. Their good work stays hidden, like a light under a basket. This writing, it will explain how a good **website design showcase** is very, very important to get new client projects. We want clients to see our skill. This guide, it helps you learn. You will see ways to make a **design portfolio** that brings much work. We will look at many ideas together. So your good designs can find good clients.

I. Understanding the Different Types of Website Design Portfolios and Choosing the Right One
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Showing your work needs a good place. Not all places are same. Some are better for some people. I will tell about different kinds of **online portfolios**. Then, you can choose what is good for you. This helps in making a good first step.

### A. Personal Website Portfolios: Ideal for Freelancers &amp; Small Businesses

I can make my own small website. This website is just for my work. I put my designs there. It shows what I can do. This way is very good for one person doing design. We call them **freelance web designers**. Small companies also can use this idea. A big good thing is I have full control. I decide how it looks. I choose the colors and the words. Nobody else tells me what to do with my **personal design site**. I can make it show my special style. Clients see this and understand my unique way. This helps them decide if I am the right designer for their project. It is like my own shop on the internet. I can change it anytime I want. If I learn a new skill, I add it fast. This kind of portfolio needs some work to make. But it gives much freedom. It is a good way to build a **professional web presence**.

### B. Platform-Based Portfolios (Behance, Dribbble): Expanding Reach &amp; Discoverability

Some big websites are there for designers. Behance is one name. Dribbble is another name. Many, many people go to these websites. They go to see new designs. They go to find designers. If I put my work on these platforms, many more people can see it. This is like putting my designs in a big, busy market. My work might be seen by people from all over the world. This can lead to more **client inquiries**. For example, some studies, they say using Behance can bring maybe 15% or even 20% more messages from people wanting websites. That is a good number. These platforms, they are easy to use. I just upload my pictures and write some words. They often have good tools to show designs in a nice way. Many big companies also look for designers here. So, it can open doors for **high-value client projects**. It is good to use these platforms, even if I have my own website. It helps my **design work visibility** grow much. Some platforms also allow people to follow my work. So, when I post new designs, they get a notification. This helps to build a group of people who like my style. These platforms are also good for **networking with other designers**.

### C. Print Portfolios: Traditional Option for Face-to-Face Meetings (When and Why To use)

Sometimes, I meet a client in their office. Or maybe in a coffee shop. We talk face to face. For these times, a printed book of my designs can be very good. This is an old way, a **traditional portfolio format**. But it still has value. It feels different to hold a nice book. It feels more personal. Pictures in a book can look very sharp and colorful. I can point to details easily. It shows I am serious and prepared. When should I use this? If the internet is slow or not there, a print portfolio is a lifesaver. Or if the client is an older person, they might like this way more. It is also good for very important meetings. It makes a strong impression. It shows I care about quality in all things, even how I present my work. I do not put all my projects in the printed book. Only the very best ones. The ones that are most suitable for that client. This type of **offline design presentation** can be a powerful tool when used at the right moment. It complements my **digital portfolio** very well.

II. Addressing Search Intent: Showcasing Your Best Work &amp; Demonstrating Value Immediately
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When people look for a designer, they have a question in their mind. They want to know if I can solve their problem. My portfolio must answer this fast. It must show my **best web design work**. It must show I can give them good value right away. This is about understanding what the client needs to see.

### A. Curating Your Portfolio: Highlighting Your Most Successful &amp; Relevant Projects

I have done many design projects. But I do not put all of them in my portfolio. That would be too much. It would confuse people. Instead, I choose very carefully. I pick only my most **successful web projects**. I select projects that are like the work I want to do more of. If I want to design websites for doctors, I show my best doctor website. This is called curating. It means selecting with great care. It is very important to show results. Not just pretty pictures. I must explain how my design helped the client. For example, I can include a small story, a **design case study**. I can say, ""For this shop, I made a new website design. After my new design, they got 25% more people buying things."" This is a **quantifiable increase**. This kind of information is very strong. It shows I do not just make things look nice. My designs help businesses grow. I focus on **results-driven design**. This helps clients see the real value I bring. So, I pick 5 to 10 of my best projects. Each one should tell a good story of success.

### B. Prioritizing User Experience: Ensuring Your Portfolio is Easy to Navigate &amp; Visually Appealing

The website where I show my work, my **online design portfolio**, it must be very easy for people to use. Imagine a client comes to my portfolio. If they cannot find my work easily, they will leave. If the pages load very slow, they will get tired. So, the user experience of my own portfolio is super important. It is like my first test. If my own website is bad, why would they trust me to make a good website for them? Everything should be clear. Menus should be simple. People should know where to click. It must also look very nice. The **visual appeal of portfolio** matters a lot. Good colors, nice fonts, and clear images are needed. It should work well on phones also. Many people will look at it on their small screens. I want them to have a smooth and happy time looking at my work. This shows I understand **good UX design principles**. It makes clients feel confident in my skills. A portfolio that is a joy to use will keep visitors engaged longer. They will explore more of my projects. This increases the chance of them contacting me. I always test my portfolio on different devices. I ask friends to use it and tell me if anything is confusing. This helps me make it better. A **user-friendly portfolio design** is a silent salesperson for my skills.

III. Crafting Compelling Case Studies for Each Project
------------------------------------------------------

Just showing a picture of a website is not enough. I need to tell a story about each project. This story is called a case study. A good **project case study** makes my work come alive. It shows clients how I think and solve problems. It helps them understand the value I delivered.

### A. Problem Statement: Clearly Defining the Client's Challenges &amp; Goals

Every design project, it starts with a problem. Or a goal the client has. In my case study, I first explain this very clearly. What was the client struggling with? Maybe their old website was confusing. Perhaps they were not getting enough customers online. Or they wanted to sell their products to more people. I write down these **client challenges** in simple words. I also state what the client wanted to achieve. What were their main **project goals**? For example, ""The client wanted to increase online sales by 30% in six months."" Or ""They needed a website that was easy for older people to use."" This part sets the stage. It helps the future client understand the context of my work. If they have a similar problem, they will be very interested to see how I solved it. This makes my **design solutions** more relevant to them.

### B. Your Solution: Detailing Your Design Process &amp; Key Decisions

After I explain the problem, I tell how I found a solution. This is where I talk about my **web design process**. I explain the steps I took. Did I do research? Did I talk to users? What were the main ideas I had? I should also detail the key decisions I made. Why did I choose a certain color scheme? Why did I pick a particular layout? What **user experience considerations** guided my choices? It is good to show this part visually. I can include screen recordings. These are small videos that show the website in action. Or I can use moving pictures, like GIFs. These can highlight **specific design elements** or interactions. For example, a GIF can show how a menu opens smoothly. Or how a button changes when you click it. This makes it easy for clients to see the thinking behind the design. It shows I don't just pick things randomly. I have reasons for my **design choices**. This section demonstrates my expertise and thought process. It shows I am a **strategic web designer**, not just a decorator.

### C. Results &amp; Impact: Showcasing the Positive Outcomes of Your Work

This is the most important part of the case study. Here, I show what good things happened because of my design. Did my design solve the client's problem? Did it help them reach their goals? I must use numbers and data to show this. This is where I showcase the **tangible results of web design**. For example, I can say, ""After the new website launched, online sales increased by 35% in the first three months."" Or ""User engagement, like time spent on the site, went up by 50%."" Or ""The new design led to a 40% increase in website traffic, as shown by Google Analytics data."" Using **metrics and data** makes my claims believable. It provides solid proof of my abilities. Clients love to see these kinds\_of **quantifiable successes**. It tells them that investing in my design services will bring them a good return. I can use charts or graphs to make the data easy to understand. Showing **positive client outcomes** is the best way to convince new clients. It turns my portfolio from just a gallery of pictures into a collection of success stories. This focus on **ROI from web design** is very attractive to businesses.

IV. Visual Presentation Matters: Making Your Work Stand Out
-----------------------------------------------------------

How my work looks in my portfolio is very important. It is not just about the design itself. It is also about how I present that design. Good presentation makes my work shine. It helps my **creative designs** get noticed. It shows professionalism.

### A. High-Quality Mockups &amp; Screenshots: Presenting Your Designs in a Professional Light

The pictures of my website designs must be very clear. They should be high quality. Blurry or small images will make my work look bad. I use good mockups. Mockups are like templates. They show my website design on a computer screen, or a phone screen, or a tablet screen. This makes the design look real and professional. It helps clients imagine how their own website could look. I take screenshots carefully. I make sure they show the best parts of the design. I might show the homepage. Or an important inner page. Or a special feature I designed. Good **website mockups** make a big difference. They present my designs in a **polished and professional manner**. I avoid using generic mockups if possible. I try to choose mockups that fit the style of the project. This attention to detail in my **portfolio visuals** shows I care about quality.

### B. Using Visual Hierarchy &amp; Storytelling: Guiding Viewers Through Your Projects

When someone looks at my project page, their eyes should move smoothly. They should know what to look at first, then second, then third. This is called visual hierarchy. Big, important things should be prominent. Less important details can be smaller. I use headings, images, and text in a way that tells a story. This is **visual storytelling in portfolios**. The story could be about the client's problem, my solution, and the great results. I want to guide the viewer through my project, not confuse them. Good use of white space is also important. It makes the page feel clean and easy to read. I think about the flow of information. I want to make it easy for them to understand the project quickly. This makes my **design project presentation** more effective. It shows I can organize information clearly, which is a key design skill.

### C. Incorporating Interactive Elements: Allowing Visitors to Explore Your Designs

If I can, I like to add things people can click on. This makes my portfolio more engaging. For example, I can include a link to the live website if it is still up and looks good. Then clients can explore the actual site themselves. This is a **live website demo**. If the site is not live, or has changed a lot, I can create a clickable prototype. A prototype is like a fake website that works. People can click buttons and see how different pages look. There are tools to make these prototypes easily. This gives a much better feel for the **user experience** than just static images. Some designers even embed small interactive parts directly into their portfolio page. This makes the **portfolio experience** more fun and memorable. It shows I am up-to-date with technology. It allows clients to truly experience my design thinking. An **interactive portfolio feature** can really make my work stand out from others who only show pictures.

V. Optimizing Your Portfolio for SEO and Discoverability
--------------------------------------------------------

My beautiful portfolio is not useful if no one can find it. So, I must help search engines like Google find my website. This is called SEO, or Search Engine Optimization. It helps potential clients discover my **web design services** when they search online.

### A. Keyword Research: Identifying Relevant Keywords for Your Target Audience

First, I must think about what words people type into Google when they are looking for a web designer. These are called keywords. For example, they might search for ""**best freelance web designer \[my city\]**"" or ""**affordable e-commerce website designer**"" or ""**user experience expert for startups**"". I need to find out what are the most **relevant keywords for my target audience**. There are tools online that can help me find these words. I can also think about what makes my services special. Am I good at a particular type\_of website? Do I work with a specific industry? These details can help me find niche keywords. These **long-tail keywords** might have less competition. This means it could be easier for me to rank high in search results for them. Good **keyword strategy for designers** is the foundation of SEO.

### B. On-Page Optimization: Using Keywords Strategically in Titles, Descriptions, and Alt Text

Once I have my list of important keywords, I need to use them on my portfolio website. This is called on-page optimization. I should put my main keyword in the title of my website pages. Each project page can have its own title, with keywords relevant to that project. For example, ""Restaurant Website Design Case Study | \[My Name\]"". I also write a short description for each page. This description appears in Google search results. It should also contain keywords and encourage people to click. For every image I use in my portfolio, I must write an ""alt text"". Alt text describes the image for people who cannot see it, and for search engines. I use my keywords in the alt text naturally. For example, for a picture of a coffee shop website I designed, the alt text could be ""**modern coffee shop website design homepage**"". Using keywords in headings (like H2, H3) on my pages is also good. But I must not stuff keywords everywhere. It should sound natural. This is key for **SEO for creative portfolios**. This helps Google understand what my pages are about.

### C. Building Backlinks: Promoting Your Portfolio to Increase Its Visibility

Backlinks are links from other websites to my portfolio website. When other good websites link to me, Google thinks my website is important and trustworthy. This can help my portfolio rank higher in search results. So, I need to find ways to get **quality backlinks for my design portfolio**. One way is to submit my portfolio to **web designer directories**. These are websites that list many designers. Some are free, some might cost money. I should check their submission guidelines carefully. I can also write guest articles for design blogs. In my author bio, I can link back to my portfolio. If my work is very good, other blogs or news sites might write about me and link to my portfolio. This is called earning backlinks. I can also share my portfolio on social media. While these links might not always have strong SEO value, they increase visibility. Building backlinks takes time and effort. But it is very important for long-term **portfolio discoverability** and **online presence for designers**.

VI. Gathering Testimonials and Social Proof
-------------------------------------------

When people are choosing a designer, they want to know they can trust me. They want to see that others have had a good experience working with me. This is called social proof. It is very powerful for **building client trust**.

### A. Requesting Testimonials from Satisfied Clients

After I finish a project and the client is happy, I ask them for a testimonial. A testimonial is a short statement from the client about their experience working with me and the results they got. I can ask them, ""Would you be willing to write a few sentences about our project together?"" Or I can send them a few simple questions to answer. Like, ""What was the biggest challenge we helped you solve?"" or ""What results have you seen from the new design?"" Good **client testimonials** are specific. They mention real benefits. For example, ""Working with \[My Name\] was great. Our new website is so much easier to use, and we've seen a 20% increase in inquiries."" I put these testimonials on my portfolio website. I can have a special page for them. Or I can put relevant testimonials on each project case study page. Reading positive feedback from real clients makes potential clients feel more confident about hiring me. **Effective testimonial requests** are polite and make it easy for the client to respond.

### B. Displaying Client Logos and Recognition

If I have worked with known companies, I can show their logos on my portfolio. This is a quick way to show credibility. When potential clients see logos of businesses they recognize, it gives them a good feeling. It suggests that I am capable of handling significant projects. This is a form of **visual social proof**. I should always ask for permission before using a client's logo, just to be polite. I can create a section on my homepage or a dedicated ""Clients"" page where I display these logos. If my work has received any awards or has been featured on popular design blogs or websites, I should showcase this recognition too. Mentioning **design awards and industry recognition** adds to my authority and expertise. It makes my **design brand** stronger.

### C. Showcasing Positive Reviews and Awards

Besides direct testimonials, if clients have left positive reviews for me on other platforms (like Google My Business, LinkedIn, or specific design review sites), I can highlight these too. I might take screenshots of these reviews or link to them. Seeing good reviews on independent platforms makes the praise seem even more genuine. As mentioned, any **design competition wins** or mentions in respected publications should be proudly displayed. This type of **third-party validation** can be very persuasive. It all adds up to create a strong impression that I am a reliable and skilled designer. This makes it easier for new clients to choose me over someone else. Building a collection of **positive designer reviews** is an ongoing effort that pays off well.

Conclusion: Continuous Improvement and Adaptation in Your Website Design Portfolio
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My **website design portfolio** is not a thing I make once and then forget. No, it is a living thing. It needs care. It needs to grow with me. The design world changes fast. New styles come. New tools appear. I learn new skills. My portfolio must show these new things. I should always be looking at my portfolio. Is it still good? Is it easy to use? Are my best projects there? I regularly add my newest and best work. Maybe I remove some old projects that do not show my current skills well. I look at my case studies. Can I make them better? Can I add more data about results? I also pay attention to what kind of clients are contacting me. If I want different kinds of projects, maybe I need to change my portfolio to attract them. Learning about **portfolio maintenance best practices** is important. This idea of **continuous portfolio improvement** helps me stay competitive. It ensures my portfolio always works hard for me. It helps my **freelance design business** or my **design agency** to keep getting good clients. Adapting and updating is key to long-term success in showcasing my design talents.

1. eating the same breakfast every day
i stopped wasting energy trying to make breakfast “fun” or new. same simple thing every day — oats, banana, peanut butter. fast, filling, no thinking. it made mornings easier and less chaotic.


2. drinking water before coffee
sounds dumb but it mattered. first thing i do now is chug a glass of water before caffeine. less hunger, fewer cravings, and it helps me wake up cleaner, not jittery.


3. closing the kitchen at 8pm
not a strict rule, just a mental boundary. if i want something after 8, i’ll drink tea or chew gum. helps with night snacking, which used to be my worst enemy.


4. never eating in front of a screen
tv, phone, laptop — all of it. if i’m eating, i sit at the table. it was weird at first but i started actually tasting my food. and stopping when i was full.


5. taking progress pics, not weighing daily
the scale messed with my head. now i just take a photo once a week, same angle, same lighting. it helped me notice real changes when the number didn’t move.

Small towns create perfect opportunities for new businesses where competition isn't as fierce as in big cities. The market in these communities is tight-knit and growing steadily. [65% of households owned pets in 2016](https://www.truereview.co/post/small-business-ideas-small-towns), jumping from 56% in 1988.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Small towns offer big business opportunities** due to tight-knit communities, lower competition, and growing markets, especially in pet care and wellness.
2. **Service-based businesses** like cleaning, landscaping, and pet grooming meet everyday needs and build loyal local customer bases.
3. **Product-based businesses** such as bakeries, grocery stores, and thrift shops thrive by creating community hubs and supporting the local economy.
4. **Digital businesses** like e-commerce stores, online tutoring, and virtual assistant services allow small-town entrepreneurs to reach broader markets with low overhead.
5. **Health and wellness ventures** — fitness studios, telehealth services, and online supplement sales — are growing rapidly and fill critical gaps in rural healthcare access.
6. **Success hinges on identifying real community needs**, building personal relationships, and choosing businesses that align with both market demand and personal passion.

# Service-Based Businesses That Meet Everyday Needs

Service-based businesses help small-town residents solve their everyday challenges. These ventures remain profitable by meeting basic needs and building strong community relationships through tailored service.

# Cleaning services for homes and offices

Small town residents want clean homes but rarely find time to keep them tidy. A cleaning service business fills this need with minimal startup costs. Industry research shows home cleaning businesses rank among the easiest to launch with low overhead. Americans understand the value of professional help—67% agree that ""professional landscape help would allow them to have a nicer yard.""

Starting a cleaning business could include these specialized services:

* Eco-friendly cleaning with environmentally responsible products
* Deep cleaning for move-ins/move-outs
* Residential maid services or commercial janitorial work

Professional cleaners charge between $30-$50 per hour. The average cleaning job costs around $180 for four hours of work. Small communities help cleaning businesses build a loyal client base quickly through word-of-mouth referrals.

# Lawn care and landscaping for year-round demand

Lawn care makes an ideal small-town business with steady, reliable income. Rural homeowners typically have larger properties that need professional care. The [landscaping services](https://bask.health/blog/good-business-idea) market reached $76 billion in 2015 and should grow 3.3% yearly through 2020.

New lawn care professionals earn $5,000-$50,000 their first year. Experienced owners make $160,000-$280,000 annually after several years. Aging baby boomers who value well-kept lawns but lack the time or interest to do the work themselves drive this demand.

# Pet grooming and boarding for local pet owners

[Pet services have grown into a booming $60 billion industry nationwide](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/successful-business-ideas-for-small-towns/). Pet ownership has jumped from 56% in 1988 to 65% of U.S. households today. Small towns need affordable, convenient pet care options, making pet grooming and boarding excellent business opportunities.

Pet businesses thrive on convenience since pet owners avoid long drives for grooming or boarding. Successful ventures combine multiple services under one roof. The most profitable businesses offer grooming, luxury boarding suites, outdoor play areas, and supervised playtime.

Pet grooming and boarding businesses excel in small communities. They create lasting relationships with repeat customers who treat their pets like family members.



# Product-Based Businesses That Locals Love

Physical retail stores create gathering spaces that build stronger community bonds in small towns. These businesses often become local landmarks where people connect and support their local economy.

# Opening a bakery or coffee shop

Small-town bakeries and coffee shops build multi-generational customer loyalty unlike their urban counterparts. [Local coffee shops](https://bask.health/blog/small-business-ideas) earn more customer dollars than large chains because they support the local economy and serve better coffee. The coffee industry will grow by 6.34% each year, making this the perfect time to bring specialty coffee to small communities.

Community connection helps bakeries build a lasting business model. Neighborhood bakeries meet many small-town needs from morning pastries to birthday cakes. A bakery stands out as one of the most profitable ventures in small towns, especially when you have specific products that match local needs.

# Starting a general or grocery store

[Small-town grocery stores](https://bask.health/blog/new-business-ideas-small-towns) deliver essential services that bigger chains miss. Grocery stores make up more than one-third of all brick-and-mortar businesses, with independent stores holding 60% of the market.

Local grocery stores create economic benefits beyond just selling necessities. They create jobs, generate tax revenue, and attract new residents. Working with local farmers brings fresh products to market and creates community connections while giving customers nutritious ingredients. Modern small-town grocers can expand beyond their local community with smart marketing strategies.

# Launching a thrift or antique shop

Thrift stores combine business success with community service. The [global secondhand market will double by 2027](https://koronapos.com/blog/how-to-start-a-thrift-store/) and reach $350 billion. Entrepreneurs can start thrift stores without a huge capital investment.

Thrift stores become community hubs through donation drives, swap events, and workshops about eco-friendly living. These stores shine in small towns because they:

* Keep usable items out of landfills
* Give residents affordable shopping options
* Let people find unique vintage and antique items

A mix of physical and online sales channels can boost your profits substantially.

# Digital and Remote-Friendly Business Ideas

Small-town entrepreneurs can now reach global markets through remote work without leaving their communities. The digital world lets them start businesses with minimal upfront costs compared to physical stores. This makes digital ventures perfect for rural entrepreneurs who want flexibility and room to grow.

# Starting an online store with local or niche products

Even the smallest towns can support thriving online stores that cater to niche markets. Smart entrepreneurs don't compete with major retailers - they target underserved segments with specific needs. Finding the right products is vital when you launch an e-commerce business. You can engage with hobbyists, tap into personal interests, and watch product trends.

Small towns offer several good ways to source products:

* Create handmade products that attract buyers looking for unique items
* Partner with local manufacturers to create original private-label products
* Use print-on-demand services that handle production and shipping

Your e-commerce platform acts as your business command center. Shopify, Wix, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce are some prominent options.

# Offering tutoring or coaching online

[Online tutoring](https://bask.health/blog/small-businesses-start-from-home) has grown quickly because more people just need remote learning options. This business model fits perfectly in small towns. You only need a computer with internet access and a quality webcam to start. Tutors can make good money and work on their schedule.

Students worldwide connect with tutors through many platforms. They teach everything from math and science to languages and test prep. Brainfuse offers free tutoring for grades K-12 with support in English, Spanish, and Chinese. New tutors can build a steady client base by focusing on subjects that are in high demand or test preparation.

# Becoming a virtual assistant or freelance marketer

[Virtual assistants](https://bask.health/blog/remote-small-business-ideas) help business owners run their operations from anywhere. They handle tasks from scheduling to customer service. A successful VA business can bring in around $40,000 each year. Freelance writing is another great option that lets small-town residents work from anywhere.

Writers and creative professionals often love the peace and quiet of small towns. These places are perfect for creating content. Rural communities also attract remote workers by offering coworking spaces. These spaces give people chances to network and access business resources they wouldn't find otherwise in smaller areas.

Local fitness facilities draw clients from all walks of life. Baby boomers want convenient exercise options, while sports enthusiasts aim to stay in top form. The [yoga market alone has grown by 50%](https://www.glofox.com/blog/opening-a-yoga-studio-10-things-you-need-to-know/) in the last five years. This $12 billion industry keeps expanding in the US. Your startup costs will vary based on your plans. Premium facilities might need $500,000 to $1 million, while smaller operations can start with $15,000 to $100,000.

New studio owners should think over:

* A location everyone can reach, with plenty of parking and transport options
* Room for different types of classes
* Ways to earn more through retail sales

You can start small by using shared spaces or community centers. Many studios succeed by starting with minimal equipment and building a loyal client base first.

# Starting a telehealth business with Bask Health

The [telehealth market](https://bask.health/blog/e-commerce-in-telehealth) hit $101.15 billion in 2023. Experts project it will grow at a 24.3% CAGR through 2030. Our Bask Health team helps healthcare providers set up compliant telehealth practices. These services help rural communities that lack specialized care facilities.

Healthcare providers launching a telehealth business just need:

* HIPAA-compliant video conferencing tools
* Systems to manage appointments
* Software that works on all devices
* Integration with electronic health records

About 85% of hospitals and private clinics plan to invest in telemedicine over the next several years. This creates great opportunities for new providers. You can earn through direct service fees ($49-$99 per visit) or subscription plans for individuals and families.

# Learning about health ecommerce for supplements or wellness products

Online health product sales keep growing. US [health and wellness sales](https://bask.health/blog/shopify-for-healthcare) rose 6.4% year-over-year through Q1 2024. Performance shakes and powders lead the pack with a 38% sales jump.

The most successful health ecommerce businesses target specific niches like digestive health and nutrition products. Many owners combine online and physical stores to reach more customers while keeping personal connections strong.

Amazon leads online health product sales right now. Yet specialized stores offering unique products continue to succeed. You might want to create your own private-label supplements or team up with innovative wellness brands. Some use Finnish water or natural Alpine ingredients to stand out.

# Small Towns: The Perfect Landscape for Entrepreneurial Success

Small towns offer ideal conditions for entrepreneurs, with strong community ties and real market needs. Service businesses like cleaning, lawn care, and pet care thrive by meeting everyday demands. Local shops—bakeries, thrift stores, grocers—double as hubs for connection.

At Bask Health, we see major potential for telehealth and wellness ventures in rural areas. Limited access to healthcare creates big opportunities, and with telehealth projected to grow 24.3% by 2030, the trend is here to stay.

Success comes from solving local problems. Unlike saturated cities, rural areas offer untapped niches and loyal customer bases. Lower overhead and community support make them perfect for career pivots, side hustles, or seasoned entrepreneurs expanding their reach.

In the end, pick a business that matches both your passion and your town’s needs. Do that, and your venture will fuel more than income—it’ll strengthen your entire community.

I recently moved to Bratislava to be with my wife, and I’m hoping to meet some fellow developers in the area—ideally people working with Java or backend technologies, but really anyone in software is welcome.

I’m currently on the job hunt, which comes with its own challenges (recruiters, you know how it goes), but more than anything I’m looking to build a network here. It’s been a bit tricky since most of the developer communities I’ve come across are in Slovak, and I’m still getting to learn the language.

So I thought I’d try my luck and reach out here and see if there are any English-speaking devs around who’d be up for grabbing a coffee or just chatting online. Whether you’re into tech meetups, mentoring, project collabs, or just want to talk code (or life in general), I’d love to connect. If you’re keen, feel free to shoot me a message.

Just dropped Episode 7 of my podcast Privileged Discussions and it’s a fun yet deep dive into Trump’s *Made in America* policy. 🌱 We use a quirky houseplant metaphor (an Aspidistra!) to explore if his push to bring factories back to the USA will work or suffer like a plant in transplant shock.  

We break down:  
- How tariffs on Canada & China are shaking up supply chains (Subaru’s already moving!).  
- *Comparative Advantage*: Why Germany makes cars, the US fracks gas, and what Trump thinks of it.  
- Practical tips to apply economic ideas to your life. 

Is Trump’s plan genius or too much, too fast? Grab a coffee and give it a listen to find out!

1kg4k1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kg4k1i/i_traded_the_chance_of_having_a_healthy/,I traded the chance of having a healthy relationship for a toxic borderline.,"Starting from the beginning...

I'm 20 years old, and a few months ago I started seeing a 23-year-old woman. I'll call her L.

She and I had a very strong connection right away, but things have been really difficult between us.

From the start, it was already hard to go out with L (it took about 2–3 tries before we could actually meet), and even after we did, things didn’t get any easier.

L has borderline personality disorder, trauma from her exes, and from the beginning she said she didn’t want a relationship.

The problem is that, while she was saying that, she was also acting like she wanted something serious—being romantic, giving gifts to me and my family, wanting me to hang out with her and her family, and, believe it or not, getting jealous.

Anyway, despite the good moments we had, over these months she kept alternating between wanting to distance herself during her crises and me always being patient, trying to talk things through and make her feel better.

It went on like that until mid-November, when we broke up for good. She said we should just be friends and wouldn’t hook up anymore.

At that time, I ended up randomly meeting a girl on Instagram (I’ll call her N). N ended up helping me a lot during that period. She supported me through the breakup and even gave me advice about the situation.

During that time, N asked me out about 3 times, but I turned her down every time because of L.

L and I had already had some fights before, but I consider this the worst one we had.

It was December, I was coming back from work when L messaged me saying she woke up wanting to hook up with someone and was going to do it because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she’d been with before her last ex).

I tried talking to her because I was upset, but instead of replying, she went to play LoL.

I spent the whole day trying to talk to her about it, and she kept saying to give her space. She only talked normally when I dropped the subject.

The next night, once things had cooled down, I brought it up again. L said she hadn’t done it but didn’t admit it was a lie either. She just said she’d lost interest.

So I decided to tell her about N and how N had asked me out (which was true). I said that the girl didn’t seem to have any romantic interest in me—it seemed like just friendship. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing at her house with her friends.

I told L and asked if I could go. I even said that if she wanted, we could date and I wouldn’t go. That I was only considering it because she didn’t want to be in a relationship.

L said it was fine, but from her tone, I felt it wasn’t.

The next day, L made plans with her cousin and pretended she was on a date to make me jealous. That’s when she finally admitted she had made everything up just to test me. She also compared me to her ex-boyfriends.

She blocked me on WhatsApp, and in desperation, I ran out of the house to go see her and brought a bouquet and some of her favorite things (an energy drink and chocolate) to try to fix things. I also messaged N and told her we couldn’t talk anymore and blocked her.

In the end, L and I made up, but everything just got worse after that.

After some time, L said I had messed up by blocking N and, even though she told me to unblock her, I insisted on keeping N blocked.

But over time, I started thinking about the whole thing and realized I had been a jerk to N and that it didn’t make sense to keep her blocked because of L.

L had been honest from the start and always said she didn’t want anything serious (even if she acted otherwise). She always made it clear I was her best friend.

Because of that, recently, I ended up unblocking N and apologizing. She accepted the apology but said she didn’t want to be dragged into this situation again.

The problem is, I didn’t tell L that I unblocked N.

On Saturday we went out for coffee and ended up talking about our last (now second-to-last) fight.

She eventually wanted to see the girl’s profile, and after insisting, I told her I had unblocked N.

From that point on, her attitude changed during the outing, and she wanted to go home. That night we were supposed to watch BBB together, but she didn’t want to anymore. Right after midnight, she sent me a video crying. I tried talking to her, and she said I wasn’t honest with her.

Sunday came, and everything just got worse. She said all she ever wanted was honesty and that I was never honest, that I always lied, and she didn’t want a dishonest friend.

I kept trying to talk and calm her down, but it just got worse. She called me, cried harder than ever, and asked for N’s profile.

She followed N, N messaged me, and I explained the situation to her. N got pissed at me, said that L and I were crazy and immature and that she had bigger problems to deal with. She said she never had romantic feelings for me and that the friendship was over, and then she blocked both of us.

I told L what happened, she asked for screenshots, and I showed them to her—which made her even worse. She sent a long message saying she forgives me but that it’s better if we go our separate ways. That she couldn’t pretend nothing happened.

I kept insisting until she got angry and blocked me (something she had said she’d never do).

She blocked me on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and even on several fake Facebook accounts I created trying to talk to her.

I even went to her house with chocolate and a letter saying I was waiting at the park near her place, but she didn’t show up or unblock me. She only unblocked me after I started sending 1 cent PIX transfers to her bank account, but she was extremely rude, told me to leave her alone, and blocked me again.

L ended up messaging my mom about me bothering her and said she’d go to the police if I kept doing it. My mom talked to her, said she liked her but that for both our sakes, we should stay away. L played the victim, said she was trying but I was bothering her.

My mom talked to me, told me to stop bothering L, and asked what had happened. I explained the whole situation. My mom found it senseless. She talked to L again, said she had spoken to me, but also told her it didn’t make sense for L to be mad since we weren’t even dating (something L always emphasized and reaffirmed to my mom), that my social media and phone were mine and that I could block and unblock whoever I wanted. I didn’t need to justify that.

Some time passed and, on Wednesday, what was already rotten got even worse. I had lent my phone to my mom to check some things on the banking app. Everything was fine until suddenly she started arguing with someone on my phone. When I looked, it was L.

Basically, L, even after I had stopped bothering her, kept posting a bunch of indirect messages on Facebook saying she preferred to be seen as the villain, that it was a blessing in disguise, that she didn’t want liars, etc... She was posting all this while I was blocked and while still having my mom on her Facebook (she knew that). At first, she posted on her stories for my mom to see, but then she got tired and posted on her main feed so my mom would definitely see.

My mom got tired of it, took one of L’s indirect posts, and shared it on her WhatsApp stories, indirectly calling L toxic.

L saw it, liked the story, and reacted with a clapping emoji—but behind my mom’s back, she unblocked me and tried to turn me against my mom. She said she now understood why I was “sick,” because my mom was the same, and said it really was a blessing in disguise.

Long story short, L and my mom had a huge fight. I tried talking to L afterward to calm things down, but at no point did she apologize. She told me to delete all our messages, not to give out her address, and said this could turn into something serious. She also claimed to have forwarded my mom’s voice messages to the police (which was a bluff).

I tried again, and she said it wouldn’t work, and that she’d be better off far away from all of this. She blocked me and asked her cousin to block me too.

It’s been a month since I’ve spoken to L, and lately, I only feel hatred toward her—but mainly hatred toward myself.

I had already written about my doubts about this relationship on Reddit before. Everyone warned me to get out and to give N a chance, but I was stupid and emotional and wanted to keep going with L thinking I was helping her and that I’d be rewarded.

In the end, I screwed myself over. I ended up destroyed, bitter, and full of regret for missing the chance at something good.

I keep asking myself: “What if I had just said ‘screw it’ to L and kept talking to N?” Maybe L would have walked away, but it wouldn’t have ended the way it did, and I would have kept a better friendship. Maybe N would have developed some interest, and I could’ve finally had a healthy romantic relationship for once.

Now I’m left bitter, disillusioned, and resentful.

Hey, friends! ✌️ Have you ever found yourself mindlessly scrolling through your phone, only to look up and realize that two hours have vanished into the digital abyss? 😅 Trust me, you’re not alone. In this tech-driven world, it’s so easy to get swept away in the tide of notifications, endless feeds, and those oh-so-addictive TikToks. 

But what if I told you that you could actually *take charge* of your tech usage and create a more intentional relationship with it? Yep, you can flip the script and go from “reactive” to “proactive” just by tweaking how you interact with the digital stuff!

Here’s how you can make that switch and really maximize your time: 

1. **Set Boundaries Like a Boss**: ⏰  
   Do you ever check your phone first thing in the morning? Before you know it, you've lost focus before even finishing your coffee. Instead, set specific times for tech usage—maybe a quick scroll after breakfast but *not* while you’re still waking up.

2. **Declutter Your Digital Space**: 📱  
   Unsubscribe from those endless emails. Seriously, do you really need 12 newsletters in your inbox? Get ruthless! Less digital noise means you can focus better on what really matters.

3. **Designate Distraction-Free Zones**: 🚫  
   Make certain areas tech-free! Maybe your bedroom is for reading (hey, no scrolling under the covers!) or the dinner table is for real conversations. Keep those spaces sacred.

4. **Choose Quality Over Quantity**: 🤔  
   Instead of jumping from app to app, pick a few that genuinely add value to your life. Whether it’s a meditation app or a cooking tutorial, spend time on what fuels your soul, not just what fills your screen.

5. **Mindfulness is Key**: 🧘‍♀️  
   Try to be aware of how tech makes you feel. Are you scrolling out of boredom, or is it because you’re looking for inspiration? Check in with yourself regularly and adjust accordingly.

6. **Plan Your Screen Time**: 📅  
   Ever heard of time blocking? Schedule time for your phone. Maybe an hour in the evening for social media but avoid it during family time or while diving into that book you’ve been meaning to read.

7. **Tech Detox Days**: 🌿  
   You don’t have to go cold turkey, but how about a full day without screens? It can be refreshing! You might be surprised at how much more you notice about the world around you (what’s that smell? Oh right, it’s dinner cooking!).

So, anyone else feeling like they might be riding the reactive wave a bit too much lately? 🌊 Let’s face it—being intentional with our tech might just unlock some of that extra time and mental clarity we all crave. Remember, it's about empowerment, not deprivation.

Before you go back to scrolling, have you had any recent “ah-ha” moments about your tech habits? What’s one change you’re willing to make this week? 🤔💬",1,1746538278.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

The dry, antiseptic light of Docking Bay 47 made the datapad in his upper-left hand reflect just enough to cause a headache, and he couldn't shake the feeling he was being punished for something.

The GC Bureau of Ordnance and Safety prided itself on its procedural thoroughness. Veltrik prided himself on being even more thorough than that. His last three field inspections had each resulted in full ship seizures, three reprimands for captains, and one entirely justified nervous breakdown.

Now he was assigned to a human vessel.

He hated humans. Not that they were the worst species in the Confederation—that distinction belonged, in his opinion, to the Vorik, who sneezed acid and considered sarcasm a mating ritual—but humans were consistently irritating in ways that eluded direct punishment. They broke rules in clever, petty, and stubborn ways. They filed incorrect forms in bulk. They made jokes during formal inspections. One had once tried to barter her weapons manifest in exchange for “the last good bottle of space whiskey in this sector.”

And now Veltrik was here to inspect a vessel flagged for seventeen violations during transit, which had requested “snack rations and fresh gun oil” upon docking. The ship’s name, Calliope’s Curse, already sounded like a war crime.

Veltrik reached the docking tube just as the final seal hissed into place. He took one look at the ship through the observation pane and seriously considered turning around.

The hull looked like it had been smacked with a meteor and then reassembled by blindfolded children with welding torches. There were three distinct kinds of metal plating, scorched in uneven patterns. He counted at least six areas covered in what was clearly salvaged roofing. One section of the starboard fuselage had “DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU LIKE PLASMA” stenciled in flaking red letters. And the ship’s registration number—technically required to be laser-etched—was scrawled on the airlock in black permanent marker.

Veltrik took a deep, calming breath, opened the hatch, and stepped aboard.

Immediately he was greeted by a sharp scent of coolant, fried circuits, and what he could only assume was burnt marshmallow.

“Hey, you must be the inspector!” called a woman from somewhere above him. He looked up.

A human in a grease-stained flight suit was half inside an open ceiling panel, chewing what appeared to be a wire.

She dropped lightly to the deck and wiped her hands on her pants. “Willis. Chief Engineer. Welcome to The Curse.” She smiled brightly. Veltrik hated her instantly.

He extended a scanner in one hand. “Fleet Compliance Officer Veltrik. This is an official inspection for weapons and systems regulation adherence.”

Willis nodded cheerfully. “Yup. You want a snack?”

Without waiting for a reply, she handed him a dark, leathery strip of material. It was labeled “Space Jerky – Original Flavor.” Veltrik sniffed it. It smelled vaguely like industrial sealant.

“Try not to chew too hard,” Willis said. “That batch might actually be industrial sealant. We had a labeling mix-up.”

Veltrik stared at her. She winked.

They proceeded down a hallway lit by flickering fluorescents. A small box labeled “IMPORTANT” fell from a ceiling panel and bounced off Veltrik’s shoulder. He hissed in surprise. A moment later, he passed a wall panel with a slow plasma leak visibly pulsing behind clear plastic. Someone had scribbled “HOT STUFF” in marker with a smiley face.

At this point, Veltrik stopped writing notes and just activated continuous recording.

They reached the outer hull maintenance deck. Veltrik looked through the viewport and felt something in his thorax seize.

There were twenty-one external railguns mounted across the hull.

He double-checked the classification. This was a corvette. GC regulations allowed six externally mounted weapons on a ship this size. Anything beyond that required special fleet authorization, which was a bureaucratic process involving three departments and two oaths of personal liability.

Veltrik began sputtering.

“Oh, yeah,” Willis said, noticing his reaction. “We’ve been adding a few over time. Salvaged most of them. That one”—she pointed to a bent, rusted cannon somehow bolted onto a maneuvering fin—“we call Old Yeller. Still kicks, if you’re gentle.”

Veltrik whirled toward her. “That is mounted on an airlock.”

“Technically above it,” she said. “Access still works. Mostly.”

One railgun was clearly mounted upside down. Another had a small red flag attached to it, with the words “SWIPE LEFT FOR LASERS.”

Veltrik checked a nearby junction box. Inside, he found a nest of wiring, some duct tape, and what he was fairly certain was a capacitor rig made from salvaged delivery drone batteries and parts of a child’s grav-skateboard. The entire array hummed with unstable energy.

Willis followed his gaze and added, “It’s all battlefield-proven.”

“Which battlefield?” Veltrik asked flatly.

She shrugged. “Whichever one we’re on.”

At that moment, a second human appeared: tall, bearded, and wearing a bathrobe, one slipper, and what looked like a powered gauntlet on his left arm.

“Captain Juno,” he said. “We’re not technically late for inspection if we never agreed on a time, right?”

Veltrik opened his mouth. Closed it again.

Juno gestured toward the view outside. “We’re classified as a deep-space agricultural processing and salvage unit. These are all salvage components, temporarily mounted for self-defense.”

Veltrik made a strangled noise.

“Our official designation with Fleet is ‘peacekeeping deterrence unit for agro-environmental intervention.’”

Willis chimed in, “We call it being loud and pointy until people go away.”

Veltrik stood in silence. His hand trembled slightly as he brought up his datapad. He tapped through the standard violation protocol, selected “emergency escalation,” and began drafting a preliminary report.

Before he could finish, the ship’s AI buzzed to life over the comm system.

“Drafting report detected. Uploading sarcasm module.”

Veltrik looked up in alarm.

The datapad’s header changed automatically:
“Just Let Us Cook, Bro.”

He slowly closed the pad.

“Sleep well,” Willis said cheerfully. “We’ll show you the internal systems tomorrow.”

Veltrik didn’t reply. He just stared into the middle distance, sighed through all four of his breathing vents, and quietly whispered the words:

“I should’ve joined sewage reclamation.”

Veltrik did not sleep.

Part of it was the ambient clunking of machinery outside his bunk, which had apparently been converted from an old cargo locker and still smelled faintly of onions and ozone. Another part was that his pillow had a rivet lodged inside it. The largest part, however, was the growing, gnawing awareness that the Calliope’s Curse should not, by any conceivable definition, be spaceworthy.

He spent the early morning reviewing the compliance manual and noting how many regulations had not merely been violated, but reinterpreted through what appeared to be the lens of madness and brute force. At some point, he gave up and started circling entire pages.

By the time Willis arrived to resume the inspection, Veltrik had developed a facial twitch in his lower left eye.

“Morning!” she chirped, sipping coffee out of a cup labeled ‘Engine Coolant – Do Not Drink’.

Veltrik gestured silently toward the hallway.

They began with internal systems. The fire suppression system was missing. Not malfunctioning — missing.

“We found it kept activating every time someone cooked anything with garlic,” Willis explained. “So now we just use these.” She handed him a plastic spray bottle labeled “Coolant (ish)”. The nozzle was melted slightly.

“And shouting,” she added. “Loud swearing stops most fires from spreading.”

Veltrik made a strangled sound in the back of his throat. Willis interpreted this as encouragement.

The emergency lighting system activated when Veltrik tripped over a loose floor panel. Instead of safety strobes, the hallway was suddenly filled with pulsing, multicolored lights and an automated voice blaring “DISCO ENGAGED”.

“Oh yeah,” Willis said. “Boosts morale during boarding actions. And weddings.”

The auxiliary reactor room was next. Veltrik opened the door, took one look, and stepped back.

“That’s a food synthesizer.”

“Was,” Willis corrected. “Now it generates low-grade antimatter bursts. We only use it if the main drive coughs up again. It’s only overheated twice.”

“You modified a food unit to process antimatter?” Veltrik whispered.

“Well, it still makes soup,” Willis said. “But the soup is very aggressive.”

They paused for lunch. Veltrik attempted to eat what the packaging called “Space Chili — Caution: May Explode.” He burned his tongue, both palms, and a section of his outer robe.

Across from him, Willis was cheerfully poking at something purple that hissed when stabbed with a fork.

Veltrik looked up, exhausted. “Why does your species do this? Build things this way? Nothing on this ship is safe. Nothing is clean. Nothing is regulated. It’s all… reckless.”

Willis leaned back, balancing her chair on two legs, and grinned. “Look, GC ships are elegant, precise, and extremely easy to blow up. One stray shot, and boom—debris confetti. Ours? We build stuff dumb, mean, and full of hate. You can set Calliope on fire and she’ll just fly angrier.”

Veltrik stared.

“The railguns?” she continued. “They’re like pets. Loud, moody, occasionally shoot straight. We name them. Sing to them sometimes. We’re not saying it works. We’re saying they like it.”

Veltrik rubbed his face with three hands. “You’ve weaponized recklessness.”

Willis grinned wider. “Damn right we did.”

That was when the red alert klaxon began. Or at least Veltrik assumed it was the red alert. The alarm was a low, warbling noise like a diseased cow trying to sing.

Captain Juno appeared in the mess hall, still in his robe, now wearing both slippers. “Heads up, everyone! We’ve got three Eeshar scout vessels approaching fast.”

Veltrik stood so quickly his chair flipped. “You can’t engage. You’re not cleared for combat!”

Juno blinked at him. “We’re not cleared for a lot of things.”

The crew scattered to stations, most still chewing. One man sprinted past with a guitar strapped to his back and no shirt. The karaoke machine in the corner flickered to life and began playing something with heavy bass and no lyrics.

Veltrik followed the chaos to the bridge. The weapons officer, a woman with a prosthetic arm and a smile that could cut glass, was already priming the railguns.

The ship’s AI, in its usual cheerful tone, spoke over the comms:
“Initiating aggressive negotiations.”

Veltrik reached for the nearest console in horror. It was sticky.

“Why is the firing button sticky?”

“Because someone spilled jam on it last week,” Willis said from behind him. “We think it makes the shots sweeter.”

Outside the viewport, all 21 railguns opened fire in staggered bursts. The Eeshar ships returned fire—sporadically, desperately—before one burst into shrapnel. The others began evasive maneuvers.

At one point, an ensign poured coffee onto a sparking panel. The console flickered, buzzed, and then stabilized.

“Balances the feedback loop,” she explained helpfully. “Also wakes up the subprocessor. She’s grumpy in the mornings.”

The battle was over in six minutes.

One Eeshar ship was completely destroyed. The other two were in retreat, venting atmosphere and running silent. The crew of Calliope’s Curse whooped and high-fived. One of the railguns was actually smoking. Someone patted it like a dog.

Veltrik stood, covered in ash and a translucent marmalade-like substance that had sprayed out of a cooling duct during the second volley. He turned to Juno, voice flat.

“Why?”

The captain smiled. “Because they shot at us first. And because we could.”

Veltrik didn’t reply. He walked back to his quarters, still dripping marmalade, and sat at his console.

He opened the compliance report. He stared at the empty template for a long time. Then, slowly, he typed two lines:

```
“Ship is not in compliance with any known safety regulations.”
“Recommend immediate promotion to rapid-response deterrent squadron.”
```

He deleted everything else, closed the file, and submitted a transfer request to sewage reclamation duty.

“At least the pipes,” he muttered, “don’t talk back.”",2,1746537958.0,OpenHFY,1,1.0,False
1kg4ev9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kg4ev9/explore_the_waterdrop_g3p800_reverse_osmosis/,Explore the Waterdrop G3P800 Reverse Osmosis System Review: Is It Worth It?,"The Waterdrop WD-G3P800 reverse osmosis system has been an exciting addition to my life, transforming my home water-filtration game entirely. From its sleek, tankless design to its advanced 10-stage filtration, I’ve found myself genuinely impressed while testing it over the past several weeks. It's a compact unit that easily slides under the sink, a necessity for anyone like me who values both performance and space efficiency.

**Advantages**

- Certified by NSF/ANSI for reducing contaminants like fluoride, PFAS, and heavy metals.  
- Tankless design, conserving under-sink space while ensuring fresh water.  
- Efficient 3:1 pure-to-drain water ratio, minimizing wastage.  
- High-output capacity: 800 gallons per day, perfect for high-demand usage.  

**Installation Simplicity and Design**

Setting up the device felt less like a chore and more like a satisfying DIY project. Granted, drilling holes for the faucet and drain pipe required some effort, but the streamlined design meant no bulky components. Its white finish and compact dimensions (18.12 x 5.67 x 17.72 inches) give it a modern vibe that complements any kitchen decor beautifully.

[Looking for Waterdrop WD-G3P800 discounts? Check Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0987fcqqw/)

**Performance and Filtration Quality**

Here's where I truly came to appreciate it. This unit has been a savior, especially for someone who drinks a lot of water daily. The 10-stage filtration process genuinely delivers, handling everything from chlorine to heavy metals. My water tastes crisp and clean, free from that metallic or chlorine aftertaste typical of regular tap water. It's notably improved the quality of my coffee as well!

During testing, I noticed how quickly it filters; you get a cup worth of water in five seconds flat. That’s thanks to the impressive 800 GPD capacity—it's a godsend when hosting family or simply keeping up with my hydration.

**Smart Features and Usability**

Let’s talk convenience. The inclusion of the smart faucet with a built-in LED display felt almost futuristic. This handy feature shows the TDS (total dissolved solids) levels in real time so I can keep tabs on water purity. Plus, the LED light automatically turns on when water flows, signaling the system is working, and the lifespan of this light is reportedly up to 50 years.

**Disadvantages**

- Initial installation involves drilling, which could deter some users.  
- Works only with a corded power source, so an accessible plug is a must.  
- Hefty weight (36.1 pounds) might pose a challenge for solo setup.  

**Product Comparisons**

I’ve had my hands on a few reverse osmosis systems before, specifically the APEC ROES-50 system and the iSpring RCC7AK. While both alternatives do an admirable job of purification, they don’t hold a candle to the G3P800 in terms of efficiency and speed. A key win for the Waterdrop model is the tankless design, which the others lack, meaning I don’t have to mess with water stagnation or additional space requirements.

That said, APEC’s system boasts slightly easier installation, and iSpring's option includes an alkaline remineralization feature, which could be appealing for those wanting to adjust the water's pH balance post-filtration.

**Value for Money**

Deciding whether this reverse osmosis beast justifies its price comes down to priorities. With the advanced 10-stage filtration system and a 3:1 water ratio that reduces wastage, it seems to pay for itself over time. Coupled with its tankless design and large capacity, the system shines in efficiency. It's an investment for households looking for excellent filtration capabilities without cluttering kitchen space.

Fort Campbell: 5July2640 06:21 local

The incessant, rapid beeping slowly wormed its way through the whiskey-fueled fog, gradually drawing Reese’s consciousness to the fore. *Who tha’ fuck?* It was the wee hours of a Saturday morning, and the previous night’s festivities quickly made their presence known through sharp spikes at his temples that insidiously synchronized themselves to the beeping, still chanting its call from the console on his desk.  Reese swore a second time, quietly, before rolling to the edge of his bed. Familiar pain spiked, and his mind swam, but Lieutenant Reese Kett was a practiced hand at navigating the minefield of an early morning hangover. 

He sank into his desk chair, popping a pair of pain-killers before chugging a full bottle of the electrolyte-rich sports drink he had left next to the pills the night before. He quietly thanked the advances in modern over-the-counter medicine as the pain was washed away, but the Fog of lingering inebriation would remain for a little while longer. He finally silenced the incessant beeping by opening the urgently marked message arriving on the wings of official US army channels. *Odd, usually this heads to the CO. Oh, right. He’s on leave, So what could possibly be so impor…”*  Reese never finished the thought as the contents of the Urgent message played into his Army-issued Cochlear Augmented Universal Monitors, the United Terran answer to cutting-edge air, land, sea, and space-born individual communications devices. The hyper-microprocessor revolution of half a century prior proved the CAUM, pronounced comm, provided the audio that accompanied the shocking images from Sol system’s resource-rich Kuiper Belt mining operations.

Kett could only look on in shock and horror. The images were from the command center of a Glencore Habitation and Command Station. A bright flash heralded the arrival of… something. A triplicate of Orbs, fused with a thick oval ring, exited the anomaly. Alarms wailed, and futile orders barked, but this newcomer was never there to talk. Bright lances of energy flared from the edges of the newcomer’s exterior ring. The Camera was recording the forward observation port; and was given a front seat to one of those vibrant green blades of energy that slice cleanly through it, severing the bodies of a third of the crew inside the command center. Half of the survivors were set ablaze as the blast superheated the air inside, but they did not burn long, and the crippled Port failed.

Lieutenant Reese Kett watched the inferno surge, being blown out into the void. A silent prayer escaped his lips as the video died, replaced by scrolling data, and fresh orders buttoned up the end of the urgent transmission. Moments later, his personal device rang. Kett stood, the last of the previous night’s festivities violently burned away by the images now seared into his memory forever, and reached into the hanging jacket to recover the device. He recognized the number, instantly knew what happened, “Hey Frank.”

Over 1000 miles away, Captain Francis Knight had just stepped away from an early morning Coffee date with his wife on the sands of Key West, “You’ve seen it?” a deep sigh groaned over the other end of the call, \*Yea, I did….. God rest their souls. What’s your ETA?\* Captain Frank Knight nodded mentally, His XO was clearly taking care to watch the information he disclosed over an unsecured line. “I’ve got a jumper flight in 45 minutes. Brass wants us mobilized within the week. I’ll see you on base this evening.” \*Damn, How’s the old lady and the kids taking it?\* Frank turned toward the shoreline, watching his wife regard him with a knowing gaze. *God, She’s gorgeous.* The thought flit through his mind just as every personal device in his immediate presence, and he suspected across the globe, began beeping and buzzing wildly, “I think it just got out, and now I get to go tell her. Wish me luck.”

 

A hoarse chuckle ripped itself from Reese’s chest, “I’ll have Doc meet you at the airfield.” He could hear the choking laugh over the device, \*Fuck you, Lieutenant\* was all Frank responded with before closing the connection. He turned just in time to be impacted by a familiar lithe frame. “How long?” Julie Knight whispered into Frank’s ear. Frank wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close and breathing in deeply. Even now, the scent of her hair seemed to draw even the tensest stress from his body, “I don’t know, but it’s bad. People are dead, a lot of people.” Julie returned his embrace before pulling back to look into his eyes, “Can you tell me who?”

Frank returned her searching gaze before glancing down at his now wildly vibrating personal device, “I can’t, but….” He opened the message containing a video link from the national news. He tilted the screen to show her and pressed play.

 Fort Campbell: 7July2640 1300 local

The room was quickly filling, and First Sergeant Mike “Darth” Silverston quickly settled into his seat. Today was not a day for the usual antics. His squad was quickly arriving, a mix of veterans and fresh enlistees alike. Private Jacob “Jace” Pleenco was the first to arrive, followed by Peter “Peppy” Thompson, and Markus “Trey” Collins. Specialist Bill “Stetson” Harrison settled into the seat next to him, “Sarn’t.” Was all he said, his face creased with distracted worry, and Mike understood why. Stetson was the grandson of a wildly successful oil family that saw the winds of change and reached for the Kuiper belt. The wide-brimmed hat he wore on days off proved a not-so-subtle hint to his origins, but Bill had taken a severe tongue lashing at his decision to avoid the family business and join up. That said, his growing up proved to provide, even here, and Stetson proved himself quickly as a demolitions and explosives expert. That didn’t keep the deep creases of worry from the Titanic Texan’s features. He had family out there, and by the looks of it, many were still missing.  Trevor “Seasick” Johnson and Xavier “Oddball” Corbon were the last of Darth’s squad to arrive, along with the last few stragglers just before the doors shut and locked.

Captain Frank Knight’s boots thumped a somber, rhythmic dirge on their way up to the podium, and a heavy, dangerous intensity settled over the company. A new addition gave a small fidget here, or there; but the very public headlines curtailed even the freshest of boots from missing the reason for their assembly. Captain Knight took the measure of the room, then tapped a key on the podium, “Men of the 10^(th) Terran.” His booming voice silences the last of the murmurs. “By now, you have seen the headlines, and you know that we have been attacked by another intelligent space-faring species. The age-old question of whether we are alone in this universe has its grim answer.” The Captain keyed another control, and the massive vessel with three interconnecting globes and an oblong ring snapped into view on the holoprojectors, “I regret to say that the station was indeed completely destroyed, and chaplains are available at the leisure of anyone who may have had family aboard. I also regret to inform you that these beings chose an artillery bombardment rather than a boarding action,” Knight keyed into existence a new set of images. “These are recordings from the United Terra sensor net.” The entire room watched as every escape pod, every fragment of the station big enough to hold survivors, and the same energy beam systematically obliterated every asteroid emitting energy signals or signs of life. Then, and only then, did small landing craft launch. “It has been decided that these Aliens mean to strip us of our resources at a minimum, or worse, erase us from existence.” A hushed murmur returned, but only for a moment as the Captain raised a hand. “I understand your reaction. This is not the first contact we had hoped for, and it appears that these Aliens may have found us by backtracking Voyager 1.” The silence was complete at this point, and the podium creaked under the captain’s grip. Spines stiffened, and eyes hardened at the set on Frank Knights face as he spoke, “Men of the 10^(th) Terran, let me remove the last questions from your mind. Each and every one of you were picked from the best of the American and European branches of the United Terran Military. We all know our mission, to counter Mars should we fight, to drop into the void and dare it to swallow you, force it to blink as it stares back at you. The Lord knows that almost happened many times over, but this!” He pointed to the images still hovering in the air behind him. “This boys… this changes EVERYTHING!” Frank Knight’s fury assailed them, each syllable a hammer forged in terrible promise. “Mars is with us, Terra is with us, Humanity is with us. In 4 days, we set sail for Kuiper. These Aliens wish to strip our home bare and murder our kin. So, I ask you this one question… FORGET dropping into hell, boys… WHO among YOU is ready!! READY to bring HELL with you! WHO among you is to ride on the wings of Damnation itself!” The room erupted, the last 48 hours of shock, horror, and anguish poured into one purpose. The 10^(Th) Terran was going to war.

 

Houston International Transit Station 11July2640: 0825 Local

First Lt Michael “Blazzin” Dawes stepped onto the loading platform of Concourse Charlie. He shifted uncomfortably in the low centrifugally imparted gravity of the aging pre-artificial gravity station. His duffel seemed to almost float on his shoulder, despite it weighing almost 80 lbs. on Terra. Soon enough, he found what he was looking for, and Mike quickly stepped over to a grizzled-looking Sergeant wearing Alpha Company patches. “Sergeant Benjamin Freedman,” The Grizzled man turned with a quick appraising nod and a salute, “Lieutenant Dawes, I see you made it alright. Th’ boys are already aboard.” He handed a data pad to the Lieutenant. “Let's see,” Mike mused, “I can confirm,” he knew he didn’t need to, but Dawes was the youngest and newest Lieutenant in the 10^(th), and he needed to practice everything he could, while he could.

 

He had joined the 10^(th) Terran less than a year ago, a fresh set of butter bars on his shoulder. He knew his men, but he also knew that the veterans in Alpha regarded him as ‘untested’. He felt it. The Sergeant at his shoulder had seen two pirate interdiction deployments and participated in the liberation of Ceres station from a radical Oligarch who was attempting to build an R.F.G. “Rod from God” meant for Terra. About a third of the men under his command came from similar backgrounds, having been blooded in the tumultuous 20-year beginning period of Human expansion inside their own solar system. Mars was much older, settled nearly 300 years prior, but many historians did not count her. The true beginning of Human expansion came with the invention of NFTL, or Near Faster Than Light, technology. This discovery came in two parts. First, the engines to propel spacecraft at relativistic speeds, and the field generation technology to keep everyone aging the same as real space. These two groundbreaking breakthroughs, two decades ago, had gifted Humanity the Kuiper Belt, and the rest of the Sol System. Sadly, the Light Speed Barrier appeared to remain intact, at least for humanity, and Lieutenant Dawes was not looking forward to the extended voyage promised. “Lieutenant?” Freedman’s question pulled Dawes from his thoughts, “Freed, I told you; it's Blazzin when we’re in the field.” Sergeant Freedman simply nodded, “Whatever you say, Lieutenant, but we depart in 5.” Dawes looked down at his watch, an ancient timepiece handed down from father to son in his family, “I see. Shall we?” He responded, and the two started down the boarding corridor, boarding the TNS Saratoga just as the departure alarms began to blare.

 

Moring clamps detached, sending a shudder through the 5-mile-long vessel. Fresh from her Refit, Saratoga’s wide, flat, angular hull bore a fresh coat of sensor-confusing stealth coating. The shore power umbilical was the last to detach, breaking away, cleaning as Saratoga’s sharply raked prow swung ‘round as she lay to course. The titanic super carrier would be the Heart of 8^(th) Fleet’s Battle Group Charlie, cobbled together from available vessels. Terra’s reach for the stars had resurrected hallowed names from Humanity’s history upon their cradle world’s vast oceans, and Saratoga was but one of the legendary names called upon to provide both shield and sword in Humanity’s aid.

 

Saratoga’s main drives flared to life in earnest, burning hard from the grasp of the homeworld, but she was not alone. TNS Indefatigable, a 7-mile-long Dreadnought-class warship, pulled alongside Saratoga’s port beam, with TNS New Jersey, another Dreadnought, mirroring Indefatigable’s position to Starboard. Ahead of the trio, TNS Destroyers Daring, Antelope, O’Bannon, and Kidd settled into their advanced positions at the fore of the formation, while TNS Fletcher and Antelope screened their rear. In two weeks, Battle Group Charlie would meet with the 3^(rd) Royal Martian Fleet group Orion, whose composition remained a mystery to Saratoga and her cohorts. Terra and Mars boasted a long, checkered relationship; each one holding their technological advancements close to the chest. In the wake of the Slaughter of over 100 thousand, both Martian and Terran had ended that competition. In two weeks, a three-century-long cold war would end, and Rivals would unite over Titan before departing for vengeance.

 

Prospect 8943785127: 28004.61

Kixere’Gor stood from his command position, a thronelike resting place that rose above the segmented pits that divided Command deck systems and duties aboard the Mik’iriz Veerkan (Eternal Victory). Subordinates bustled below him, each one refusing to look up to him, both a sign of respect… and one of fear. Kixere’s four legs spun his 4-meter-tall, narrow torso smartly around, and he measured his pace to a menacing march while he departed the bridge. One of his three arms reached for the refreshment console inside of his ready room, ordering his evening meal. Moments later, his triple-segmented Mandibles spread, tearing into fresh if vacuum damaged flesh. His subordinates would have to wait, but as the Lord Master of the Mik’iriz Veerkan, It was his right by the old codes to taste of the flesh of the defeated at his pleasure. It was the I’Krian Principality way It was a shame that none survived the bombardment. The living were so much more delicious than the frozen dead.

 

Kixere mused over the after-action reports, comparing them to the intelligence He had been given for this expedition. A Deathworld full of primitive Sapiens; how they survived their cradle to reach for the stars was the Void’s own mystery. It mattered little, It was clear they were fleeing their home, desperately reaching for the edges of their cradle system. The Military installations he had effortlessly obliterated were pathetically under protected and barely armed. If this was the might of these “Humans”, then bringing their world to the heel of the Principality would not require the vast resources brought to bear in this backwater hellhole. He perused the intelligence package once more. Extreme gravity, dangerous weather anomalies, poisonous plants, and lethal animals. The Species that survived that world should have put up more of a contest, but it mattered not. He was meant to be but the spy, merely here to scout and report back.

 

The ludicrous nature of what he had discovered demanded Kixere act, and his attack had proven a wild success. His meager scouting vessel single-handedly carved the foothold required to secure the arrival of the main fleet. The console beeped, announcing the same fleet’s arrival, and Kixere chose another morsel, activating the holographic projectors inside his office. The Sensor feed from his vessel flashed into existence just as a triplicate of moons arrived with the same bright flash of subspace rupture. These moons, captured eons ago and painstakingly converted into the mother vessels the I’Krian used at the core of their voidborn forces. V’Keees Xoor (Superior Hand), Wixri’anir (Subjugation), and Mu’xirin Vak’ralen (Hallowed Destruction) each carried over 100,000 single-seat fighter and attacker aircraft, but they did not deploy them. Mother vessels were the only vessels capable of crossing the great expanses between the stars. The key to the Principality's dominance, the Quantum Subspace Render, was small enough to be put into even a small vessel such as Kixere’s, and the unique mission set of his command required its installation. The QSR’s power requirements relegated such combinations to incredibly short ranges. The Mother ships were the only vessels in the Principality's possession capable of transiting the length of the Principality’s territory.

 

One mother vessel was a death sentence for those who opposed the Principality, and Kixere watched entire warships undock and deploy from all three. Whatever the Principality had acquired from their information exchange with the Vilgrian Infogarchy had obviously spooked his betters. Kixere closed the hologram feed just as the 1300^(th) warship was deployed from the third Mother vessel, leaning back to finish his meal. *No matter, such an overreaction undoubtedly will improve the review of my actions here.* The thought carried him through to desert, a delectable blood pudding.

This 48-inch patio loveseat glider has made its way onto my outdoor seating area, and I've spent an excessive amount of time on it—both as a cozy spot for morning coffee and as a serene escape during sunset. As someone who loves patio furniture that offers both style and usability, I approached this product with high expectations. Spoiler alert: while it met most of them, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

The steel frame of this glider chair immediately caught my eye. It feels exceptionally sturdy, lending a solid and durable base to the entire piece. The alloy steel finish doesn’t just add that industrial chic look—it’s also a bonus for weather resistance. Its brown fabric and frame seamlessly fit into my patio's aesthetic, offering a neutral yet stylish vibe. The seat is made from durable, breathable fabric that promises ventilation, a feature I found very helpful on those toasty summer afternoons. At 34.5 pounds, moving it around when rearranging your patio is manageable, but it firmly stays in place when you sit down. One small downside? The fabric showed slight wear after prolonged cleaning with a damp cloth, but it’s nothing too major.

**Ergonomic Comfort**

Sitting on this loveseat doesn’t just feel good—it feels *right*. The backrest is designed to follow the natural contours of your spine, ensuring a pleasant posture without straining. Plus, the curved armrests provide a soft landing space for your arms while sipping on a cup of tea or scrolling endlessly through your phone. It’s not just me—my partner joined me for an hour of chatting on this glider, and neither of us felt the dreaded ""seat fatigue."" The seat-to-floor height of 16 inches feels perfect, making it easy for both shorter and taller individuals to sit and stand without trouble.

**Smooth Gliding Motion**

Here’s where the chair truly won me over: its dreamy gliding experience. It glides silently, creating a soothing effect that’s both relaxing and satisfying. The noise-free operation is a win for maintaining the tranquil vibe of a backyard seating area, allowing me to sway gently without startling birds or annoying the neighbors. My kids, curious as always, couldn’t resist the urge to test its limits, and even under their antics, the chair held strong. A minor note, however—if you might weigh toward the maximum 400 lbs capacity, the rocking motion could feel a tad more restrained.

**Spacious Seating Experience**

Though described as a two-seater, the glider strikes a balance between a cozy loveseat and a spacious bench. Its 46"" x 18"" seat size feels perfect for two average-sized adults. My neighbor and I even tested it with snacks spread out between us, and it didn’t feel cramped. Still, if you’re expecting to lounge solo while spreading out your legs, you might find yourself wishing for just an inch or two extra.

**Where Does It Fit Best?**

Apart from my patio, I tried this product indoors to see if it would blend in with a living room or bedroom. Surprisingly, it doesn’t look out of place indoors. Placed near a large potted plant with a throw blanket, it added an inviting charm to the corner of my bedroom. Outdoors, it fits perfectly in spaces like backyards, poolside setups, and even lawns. Beware, though: the lack of cushioned fabric might not suit everyone if placed indoors for long lounging sessions.

**Highlights**

- Durable steel frame ensures stability and longevity.  
- Fabric breathability adds comfort, even during hot days.  
- Smooth and silent gliding motion makes it stand out.  
- Ergonomic backrest and armrest design support prolonged use.  

**Drawbacks**

- The fabric can show signs of wear after routine cleaning.  
- The gliding motion feels less fluid under maximum weight loads.  
- Although it resists light rain, continuous exposure could affect the finish.

**Competing Products**

In exploring alternative patio gliders, the Giantex chair has notable competitors like the Mainstays Outdoor Glider and Outsunny Loveseat Glider Bench. Mainstays often win on price point but fall short in material strength. Outsunny, on the other hand, boasts cushioned seats, which some may find more comfortable. However, in terms of overall balance—spaciousness, durability, and aesthetics—the Giantex glider stands out. What makes it better than Mainstays is its steel frame and premium fabric that can handle more demanding outdoor conditions. While Outsunny provides comfort, it compromises on structure and could be less stable under larger weight loads.

**Bang for the Buck**

What surprised me the most about this glider was the combination of features it manages to pack for its cost. Given its ergonomic design, smooth gliding motion, and weather-resistant steel framework, I feel it justifies the investment for someone looking for the perfect outdoor seating companion. It compares well in its price-to-quality ratio, especially considering cheaper offerings often compromise on key materials or durability. That said, the lack of bells and whistles like built-in cushions might not appeal to those looking for ultra-luxury at a similar price point.

I have started CPAP for a couple months but with no improvement, I end up taking it off in the middle of the night or can’t fall asleep with it on. For the last couple years, since my classes have begun in the evening and I don’t have to wake up early I’ve been sleeping anywhere from 2-6am and waking up at 12-4pm. I cannot get out of bed to save my life. I still get 8-10 hours of sleep each night but I have horrible brain fog and fatigue throughout the day.

But even though I’m tired all day, I can’t fall asleep/get sleepy at night. I know my circadian rhythm is out of balance but whenever I reset it, it always ends up shifting forward again. I end up getting sleepy an hour or two later than the night before so I suspect I have DSPD or insomnia. I’m just so frustrated of being sleepy all day and not being able to sleep at night. I don’t take stimulants but I have a cup of coffee after waking up. 

I’m sick of seeing the sun for two hours and having no time in the day. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’ve become really depressed having no energy in my youth.

Literally never used a substance, nor had the desire to ever use them till age 18 when it started. The depression got so bad, I didn't want to live any more and couldn't cope on my own. Before I was medicated, I got deeply unstable. It was a trend towards worse substance issues over time. It started with needing weed every day to keep myself from suicide. Then it progressed to drinking a lot at one point. Then it progressed to very frequent kratom abuse, and eventually full-on kratom addiction leading to two hospitalizations from being suicidal during withdrawal. Wasted all my money. After quitting kratom I just coulnd't stop.

I switched to alcohol and got addicted to alcohol, drank $1000 dollars of my parents liquor secretly, and when it was all gone, started stealing their money to get more. I ended up in rehab, and over time I was able to kick the addiction with med stabilization. I thought the issue was over with, but I got unstable again and had a week long suicidal bender lasting until 4 days ago. I feel like it's a slippery slope and if I start drinking eventually I'll end up having addiction until I get stable again. The depression is so severe, so hopeless, so painful. I tried killing myself three weeks ago and that's what led to the bender. I just can't handle it and crack and it only makes things worse but once the money is all gone, I get this horrible mental agony like im on fire and want to die when I can't drink until a few days after my last drink. Cigarettes and coffee are the only thing that keeps me from drinking. I couldn't even go a day without severe depression before being on adderall. I wish I could stop but I just can't right now. I don't think drugs are the problem as much as instability. I want to be able to drink like normal people, I want to be able to have fun and socialize normally without the depression, but I just don't know if I'll ever be able to drink normally, I could fuck up my life, lose my job, or fail college if I go on a bender, etc.",8,1746537706.0,bipolar2,9,1.0,False

Unfortunately, I've gotten a good amount of bottle variation, even in the same cases. Still, I feel 2010 was a good year for Malescot. Had this in 2023.

Nose: smells surprisingly past peak fruit aromas, getting more wood and floral notes, a sort of dirty potpourri, dark chocolate, solid stuff.

Palate: light to medium bodied, entry is just flower juice, spreads on the mid palate showing a classic Cabernet Sauvignon blend profile, good amount of wood, cedar, toasted red wood, hints of chocolate and coffee, but these revert to more floral flavors on the back, iron, light chalk, light salt.

Finish: short to medium, dry, tannins taking over, dried flowers and cigar box, light dark fruit.

So. What to do, what to do... hm hm hm.... I really should walk the dog...

I know! Let's impeach the guy. We'll have to work together on this. We'll have plenty of time, since Wal-Mart is about to run out of stuff to sell and everyone's about to lose their jobs. And there won't be anything to replace that stuff with for at least two months, so we won't have anything else to do, over the summer. Good news, right? We can focus down and really devote time and energy to it. We can make the biggest, most beautiful lemonade ever seen. The biggest, most beautiful lemonade ever conceived of by the mind of man. O in altri siti!

The Plan

So here's the plan. We're each going to do two things every day. Each should take about half an hour. So -- right now -- set aside one hour a day to do these two things. Decide what hour you're going to take out of your day, and schedule this hour in, every day, right now.

FIRST HALF HOUR

Call all three of your congresspeople every day. Each of us has two senators and one representative, and we're each going to call each of them every day.

If we actually get one of them on the phone (we won't) (BE POLITE) we will say five things:

a) I want to know what you did yesterday, to impeach Trump.

b) I want to know what you're doing tomorrow, to impeach Trump.

c) If Trump is not gone, by the time you come up for election again, I'm voting for the other guy. I don't care if it's Stalin, Mao, or Hitler: if Trump is not gone, I'm voting for the other guy.

d) I am working every day to recruit others to call you every day and to vote against you at the next election, if Trump is not gone by then.

e) Ask if they would like the names of the people you spoke with yesterday to try to recruit them. Give them the names.

If whoever answers the phone can't get the congressperson on the phone, ask for a call back and leave a message, with the above five items.

SECOND HALF HOUR

Recruit. Whether at work, at home, at the gym, at the library, at the coffee shop, walking down the street, wherever you go that other people are there, talk to people. Say, ""Do you support Trump?""

If the answer is yes, say ""What's it going to take, to get you to change your mind?"" Have a discussion. Be pleasant.

DO NOT call them a racist or an idiot. (Remember: when you're hateful and ugly, people move AWAY from your position. You want them moving TOWARD your position. That means: no hateful, no ugly. I know, it's so much fun to be hateful and ugly, but we just can't afford it right now. Sorry. Maybe after AOC gets to be president! (lol as if, right?)) Ask for their name. Make a list.

If the answer is no, say ""Do you have a plan, to get Trump impeached?"" Ask what they're doing. Ask if they'd like to know what you're doing. Share your plan with them. Maybe take a copy or two of this plan with you, so you can spread the good news. Ask for their name. Make a list.

(The good news is: Trump is on his way out. I can feel it. The tide has turned. He has run out of distract-o-meal. He has run out of magic bullshit dust. There are actually more of us than there are of him yay!!!)

SUGGESTIONS

First, If you first invite them to coffee, it's much easier to get their name afterwards.

Second, time is a lot like money. If you invest it, results accumulate slowly but surely. Every hour you put in on this is going to bring accumulating returns, just like interest on a bank account or your cut of an insurance sale, that ultimately will turn the tide for us.

Third, record your efforts. Don't lose track. How much time you put in, who you talked to. You'll want to know, and others will want to know too. It'll be a badge of honor.

Just a thought.

Full Review","Using the InSinkErator F-2000S Premium Under Sink Water Filtration System has been quite the experience. With a sleek off-white design and a compact build measuring 3 inches by 6 inches by 8 inches, it fits seamlessly under my kitchen sink. The setup alone felt like I was upgrading not just my water, but my entire kitchen. It’s an aesthetically neutral piece, so while it’s hidden away under the sink, it doesn’t clash with other appliances if spotted during installation.

**Merits**  
- Improves water taste by reducing chlorine and odors.  
- Certified for safety, removing contaminants like lead and mercury.  
- Easy replacement with its quick-connect fitting.  

The **NSF certification** on this system gave me peace of mind, ensuring the water I drink is free from harmful particulates, including asbestos and benzene. It performs well by filtering out cysts, chlorine, and other impurities. The filter replacement process couldn’t be more straightforward; even if you’re as unskilled at DIY tasks as I am, the quick-connect fitting system has your back.

[Check InSinkErator F-2000S price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00dyiymju/)

**Ease of Installation**  
Personally, installation was a breeze. The unit came with clear instructions, which even my cousin, who has zero technical experience, followed with minimal issues. It’s specifically meant for use with InSinkErator water dispensing systems, so compatibility is key. A heads-up: if you’re thinking of pairing this with the SST-FLTR Stainless Steel Tank & Filtration System, it won’t work. Learned that the hard way during some early internet searches.

**Performance**  
The water flow rate of 0.75 gallons per minute is great for daily use. Using the system daily for both drinking water and cooking has been incredibly satisfying. It really changes how tea and coffee taste. Also, I noticed how my pasta and rice seemed brighter and less cloudy compared to before using the system (yes, I'm picky about details like that). The automatic shut-off during filter changes ensures no accidental spills, which is perfect for the clumsy folks like me.

**Downsides**  
- Does not work with certain hot water tanks.  
- Filter lifespan limited to roughly six months before replacement.  

While I adored how the filtered water tastes, I wouldn’t say the filtration system is perfect for heavy use. My home has three adults and two kids, and I had to replace the filter sooner than anticipated. For smaller households, this might not be a problem.

**Target Users**  
If you’re someone who values clean water free of particulates and harmful chemicals or wants to avoid the ever-growing issue of plastic bottled water waste, this system is for you. It’s also a money-saver in the long run. However, larger households need to consider the frequency of filter replacements. For a single person or couple? This would work like a charm.

**Other Options**  
In my search for water filters, I compared this with some market rivals. Brands like Brita and Aquasana offer countertop or pitcher-based systems. While they’re portable and visually stylish, the InSinkErator F-2000S offers the convenience of being installed under the sink. No clutter on kitchen counters! However, compared to systems like Aquasana’s under-sink options, it falls slightly behind in advanced filtration capacity for extremely critical users.

**Cost Assessment**  
Relative to alternatives, this filtration system feels like an upper-mid-range offering. It’s not absurdly pricy, but it’s not budget-tier either. For the features it offers—like advanced filtration for lead and mercury, quick installations, and under-sink convenience—it’s worth the spend. That said, frequent filter replacements could stack up additional costs over years. Ultimately, it delivers **quality for price.**

First of all, we're separated. You have no say over anything I do, let alone my freaking sleep schedule. 

Secondly if you're not happy with the time I wake your ass up to take the kid to the sitter, set a freaking alarm. 

It frustrates me to NO END. I already drag my ass out of bed between 730 and 740, get the toddler up, dressed, fed and her bag packed for the day. I have her in her carseat and ready to go at 850 so I can then go into my office for 9. 

I see absolutely no reason I should be getting up any earlier than I already do. 

It immediately pisses me off when he starts going off saying I should ""go to bed earlier"" and get up ""at a decent hour like an adult"" 

Like fuck you. I have ALWAYS gotten up before you because I'm expected to make the coffee, the breakfast, find everyone clothes for the day and do ALL the prep work to get the day started. ALWAYS.

I (26F) recently cut down on my sugar intake dramatically to assist in weightloss and overall a better quality of life. It has been going well, I am a week and a half in. I keep waking up with these horrible horrible migraines, and I’m assuming it’s the sugar, because I am a regular migraine receiver and my migraines only really come right before my monthly cycle due to the way my hormone levels operate. 

It’s difficult to deal with these because after a certain point I do have to take a prescription migraine medication which only allows me to have 9 tablets a month which is not a lot when sometimes, on rare occasion, i need 2 pills to knock out a migraine. I am trying to manage with over the counter NSAIDs, but i end up with a stomach ache because if I wait until I eat like I’m supposed to, they wouldn’t be able to cure the headache, just take the edge off. For me, I have to be very timely and urgent when I have a migraine because it can very quickly make me nauseous and feel like I have vertigo if not treated quickly. 

Sometimes a bit of creamer in my coffee helps, as I am not trying to fully eliminate but rather drastically reduce the sugar intake. However, I’d prefer if there was a way I can avoid waking up with the migraine altogether, if possible. But if it’s just waiting it out, I understand and will have to make do. If you have any insight that would be greatly appreciated ❤️",0,1746537070.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.5,False

I was in my last semester of engineering, struggling through classes and finals when I landed my first client. Six months later, I've somehow built a small but profitable offshoring company helping US small businesses hire remote staff from abroad (mostly admin, support, and back office roles).

We just crossed $30,000 in profit not revenue and I still can't believe it. Started with literally $0, worked out of coffee shops and dorm lounges, and figured everything out through trial, error, and way too many late nights stalking Reddit threads.

If I'm being completely honest, I couldn't have done this without my girlfriend. She's not just my life partner but my business partner too. From organizing our back-end chaos to helping me not sound like an idiot during our first client call, she's been in it with me since day one. We've learned (and unlearned) so much together, and I'm beyond lucky to have her by my side.

Some real, unfiltered takeaways for anyone curious:

It's definitely not passive. You'll be working at weird hours to sync with multiple time zones, and there's no escaping the midnight Slack messages.

The first 2 clients were brutal to land. After that, referrals started trickling in and made everything easier.

There are real pitfalls. Communication gaps, missed expectations, and one near-legal mess that had me stress-eating ramen for a week taught me more than any class ever could.

Margins are actually better than I expected. Once processes are in place, remote teams can deliver serious value for what clients pay.

I'm not an expert or some guru just figured out something that worked and kept pushing through the rough patches. Happy to answer anything if you're curious about how I found clients, how we handle team quality, pricing, taxes, whatever.",0,1746536625.0,smallbusiness,5,0.41,False

### TL;DR

**Rank** | **Why it made the cut**  
:--|:--  
**1. [Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds](https://www.zoopy.com/r/best-anc-wireless-earbuds/#bose-quietcomfort-ultra)** | 🥇 *Audiophile-grade sound, top-tier ANC, spatial audio*  
**2. [Sony WF-1000XM5](https://www.zoopy.com/r/best-anc-wireless-earbuds/#sony-wf-1000xm5)** | 🎛️ *Customizable sound, strong ANC, comfy all-day fit*  
**3. [Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C)](https://www.zoopy.com/r/best-anc-wireless-earbuds/#apple-airpods-pro-2)** | 🍏 *Seamless Apple integration, excellent transparency mode*  
**4. [Earfun Air Pro 4](https://www.zoopy.com/r/best-anc-wireless-earbuds/#earfun-air-pro-4)** | 💸 *Surprisingly powerful ANC under $100*

---

### The verdict in a nutshell

**1. Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds** – *“The ANC gold standard.”*  
These crushed subway rumbles and plane engines like nothing else I tested. Add lush, spacious sound with **immersive audio**, and you’ve got a clear winner—especially for folks who want pure isolation.

---

**2. Sony WF-1000XM5** – *The feature-packed all-rounder.*  
Sony's app lets you tweak **everything**: ANC levels, EQ, ambient sound, and even ear shape calibration. Light, comfy, and loaded with smart features. Android users, this one's for you.

---

**3. Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C)** – *Best choice for Apple users.*  
Pairs in seconds, switches between devices like magic, and has the best **transparency mode** I’ve heard. ANC is excellent too, and now it uses USB-C. If you’re in the Apple bubble, it’s an easy pick.

---

**4. Earfun Air Pro 4** – *Budget noise-cancelling done right.*  
You’d never guess these cost under $100. Solid ANC, good sound, multipoint Bluetooth, and even wireless charging. Mics are mid-tier and the app is basic—but it punches way above its weight.

### FAQ 🤔

- **Are these good for phone calls?**  
  📞 *Bose and Apple are top-tier. Sony is good. Earfun is okay unless it's windy.*

- **How’s the battery life?**  
  🔋 *6–8 hours with ANC on. Each case gives 2–3 full recharges.*

- **Do they work with both Android and iOS?**  
  ✅ *Yes. But AirPods are best with iOS, Sony is better on Android.*

- **Which has the best transparency mode?**

L-R
Initio Atomic Rose

This is powerful.  A strong, heady fragrance that lasts well.  I got this in my quest to find the ultimate sexy rose.  I do enjoy it v much but at times it is on the cusp of feeling like a headache.  Don't need more than a spray of this beast!

Agent Provocateur 

This isn't particularly dark rose at all but have included in the line up cos it's been a go to 'going out.  Feeling sexy' fragrance for me for 25 years! It's powdery and intoxicating.  Doesn't open the best and sniffing the lid may be offputting but it dries down into something beautiful that totally works with my skin chemistry.

Serge Lutens La Fille de Berlin

Just gorgeous!  Totally fits the brief for dark, sensual rose.  Imagine if red velvet and black lace had a smell! Or pricking yr finger on the rose stem and sucking the blood!  Oozes mystery.  It leans to quite a synthetic rose smell but it is so jammy and rich it gets away with it.  Beautifully blended rose, fruit and patchouli that isn't sweet; smells expensive and classy.

By Terry/ Terry De Gunzburg Rouge Nocturne

I adore this! Signature scent since it came out.  Now discontinued but I have a back up bottle!  Channeling same energy as La Fille de Berlin but this is lighter, softer and more powdery.  This is my idea of romantic.  Aiming for vamp, but finger twirling ringlet curls rather than bleeding in mouth! 🤣  My date night to wedding day baby! Dunno why more people didn't love this and it didn't become iconic rather than shelved in less than a decade.  But I guess that's the fate of many lovelies in a hypercompetitive field.

Guerlain Rose Amira

I love this! Is more of the same but is newer in my collection than the Lutens and Terry.  I'm not so attached to it but that may change.  Its dark and rich. Is probably somewhere between the last two.  More complex than Atomic Rose.

Jo Malone Taif Rose

This is dark rose energy!  The coffee notes give it a bitterness I love.  It truly has an edge. Probably more polarising than Rose Amira.  There's the rose.  And there's the coffee.  They sit together distinctly, particularly on dry down.

Creed Carmina

My least favourite.  Could happily live without this and not touch again.  The others do it better.  This is headache inducing for me.  The fruitiest of the lot but sadly for me, doesn't work so well.  I loved it testing in store when I was panicking I could never have Terry Rouge Nocturne again!

Pic 2 is my lighter daytime rose collection.

I included AP again! Just spray less of it a good 20 mins before leaving the house and it's a goer in this ballpark too!

Miller Harris Rose Silence is the freshest, natural smelling rose.  Is just lovely and classy.  Feel like I don't need Delina in my life with this far less expensive beauty.  It doesn't last as long as Delina.  But works for me.

The Bvlgari one is fresh and gorgeous too.  Understated.

Penhaligon's Liquid Love is lighter than I expected so more of an everyday pleasant blend rather than knockout date night. I do like it very much and am pleased with the purchase.  I like this house a lot and have had loads from there over the years.

By this question, I DO NOT MEAN PETTING OR DISTRACTING BEHAVIORS!! They are working, and I would never want to detract from their jobs while they’re on them. It can mean life or death. 

Anyways. An example if it would help. I went to a coffee shop this morning and a person there had a service dog. The dog was beautiful and so well behaved. A golden retriever in a red vest. I couldn’t help but gush a little and smile and give him “cute” (lol?) eyes because just seeing this precious dog brought a little joy to my day. Even more so to see that there’s a person who needs this dog getting the service they require. Overall, I view seeing a true service animal as a very positive experience. Back to my point. I did NOT address the dog. I didn’t address the owner. It was a quick “AW SO CUTE” moment. I was nowhere near them in actuality - the shop’s pretty large. Then I noticed the owner looking at me a bit oddly. So of course I stopped fawning and regained my cool a bit. Awkward white girl smile and all that. 

I ask this because I’ve had similar experiences in other scenarios, but nobody’s ever actually told me anything straight up. I absolutely mean no harm or offense. So mostly I just want to know. Is this overthinking? Or is this a behavior that I should work on correcting?

Ever found yourself trapped in the endless loop of overthinking? You know what I mean—scrolling through options like you’re picking a Netflix show, but instead you’re trying to decide whether to start that new project, switch careers, or even just commit to a workout routine. It’s like staring at a menu with a million choices but being too paralyzed to order anything! 🤯 

Here's the thing: **we’ve all been there**, and it can be exhausting. Sometimes, it feels like the fear of failure is sitting right there with us, sipping coffee and making judgmental comments. But what if I told you that there’s a powerful way to flip that perspective? 

Let’s dive into the magic of the “**Fail Fast**” mentality. This isn’t just a catchy slogan—it’s a game-changer for anyone looking to unlock their elite performance.

Here’s what you need to know:

**1. Embrace the Messy Middle**
   - Life isn’t a straight line. It’s often a jumbled, chaotic dance of successes and failures.
   - Ever seen a toddler learning to walk? They fall **a lot** before they get it. But hey, they keep trying! 🌟

**2. Decide, Do, and Digest**
   - Instead of getting stuck in ""what ifs"", make that decision, take the leap, and see what happens.
   - It’s like tasting new food—sometimes you hit gold, and sometimes it’s a hard “nope.” But at least you’ve tried!

**3. Failure = Feedback**
   - Each “failure” is just information wrapped in a disappointment burrito.
   - Open it up! What can you learn from it? What would you do differently next time?

**4. Perfection is a Myth 😅**
   - Seriously, who are we kidding? The quest for perfection is like chasing a mirage. 
   - The sooner you realize that perfect doesn’t exist, the faster you can start creating, building, and living.

**5. Community Counts!**
   - Surround yourself with people who *get it*. They can help lift you out of that struggle.
   - Share your plans (even the questionable ones), and you might find a support squad willing to cheer you on! 🎉

**So, what’s holding you back?**  
Are you afraid of what others might think? Worried that you’ll screw it up? You’re not alone! This is where authenticity and vulnerability come into play.

A quick story: I once hesitated for months to launch my passion project because I thought I needed everything to be perfect. Then one day, I hit “send” on my first email—flaws and all! 🎈 It wasn’t perfect, but the feedback flowed in, and guess what? It turned into something rewarding I never expected. 

As they say, ""The only way to guarantee failure is to never try at all."" So, maybe let’s embrace failure as a friend rather than a foe? 

The next time you sense that analysis paralysis creeping in, remember that every brilliant idea is one messy step away from reality. **Let’s turn those dreams into actions and make some beautiful mistakes together!** 

Here’s to moving forward, embracing the bumps along the way, and finding our stride in the chaotic dance of life! 💪✨",1,1746536140.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1kg3qly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kg3qly/does_the_secura_french_press_coffee_maker_live_up/,Does the Secura French Press Coffee Maker Live Up to Reviews?,"The Secura SFP-50DSC French Press Coffee Maker has been part of my daily coffee routine for a while now, and I’ve come to appreciate its functionality while also noticing some quirks. Equipped with a sturdy 304 stainless steel body, this coffee press immediately feels like it's built to last. Both the exterior and interior are crafted from the same premium-grade material, giving the impression of durability that you’d expect from a top-tier French press.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me was how solid this coffee maker feels. Its modern stainless steel finish not only looks elegant in my kitchen but also holds up well against scratches and stains. Unlike glass French presses I’ve owned in the past, I don’t have to baby this one. The ""Cool"" touch handle, a well-thought-out feature, makes pouring comfortable and safer since it doesn’t heat up even after hot water has been sitting inside for several minutes. However, its 3.7-pound weight does make it feel a tad heavy when compared to other models I’ve tested. While it’s dishwasher safe, rinsing by hand is straightforward thanks to the simple, easy-to-take-apart design.

**Ease of Use**

If you’ve ever used a French press before, you’ll feel right at home here. Even if you’re new to the experience, using this model is intuitive. The three-layered stainless steel filter system stood out to me the most. It does a phenomenal job of trapping even the finest coffee grounds, resulting in a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee that rivals those from high-end coffee shops. Admittedly, I was skeptical about the filter system initially, but after stacking a couple of the provided screens to refine the taste further, the results were impressive. Small coffee particles were nowhere to be found in my cup, which was a win.

**[Check Secura SFP-50DSC French Press price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00uqz0e8c/)**

**Capacity and Performance**

With a 50-ounce capacity, this French press is perfect for families or anyone hosting a coffee-drinking crowd. During a recent weekend brunch with friends, I brewed a batch that served five of us easily. It definitely holds more than many competitors in the market, which often cap out at 34 ounces. The insulated design ensures that the coffee stays warm longer, though not piping hot forever. After about 45 minutes, I noticed the temperature had started to drop significantly, so keep that in mind if you like to savor your coffee over a longer period.

**Highlights**

- Durable 304 stainless steel construction that resists wear and tear.  
- Triple-layer filter system for a smooth, grit-free coffee experience.  
- Generous 50-ounce capacity suitable for groups or larger households.  

**Critiques**

Despite its numerous positives, there are a few areas where this French press could be better:

- The weight might deter users who prefer lighter, more portable options.  
- The insulated design keeps coffee warm but falls short of truly long-term heat retention.  

**Alternative Offerings**

When comparing this to other products, the Secura French Press stands out for its durability and larger capacity. For instance, the Bodum Chambord French Press, though a household favorite, features a glass carafe that isn’t as robust or forgiving as stainless steel. On the flip side, the Bodum models are often lighter and easier to travel with. Another competitor, Mueller French Press, offers a similarly sleek stainless steel design but at a slightly smaller capacity. If portability isn’t a concern and you’re after volume, the Secura edges past many of its peers with room to spare.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

The affordability of this French press compared to others I’ve tried is worth a mention. Considering it includes extra screens and delivers excellent performance, the price-to-quality ratio leans heavily in your favor. The fact that it’s virtually unbreakable adds significant value, especially if you're like me and have suffered shattered glass presses in the past. It’s not just a coffee maker; it’s an investment in convenience and longevity.

Fort Campbell: 5July2640 06:21 local

The incessant, rapid beeping slowly wormed its way through the whiskey-fueled fog, gradually drawing Reese’s consciousness to the fore. *Who tha’ fuck?* It was the wee hours of a Saturday morning, and the previous night’s festivities quickly made their presence known through sharp spikes at his temples that insidiously synchronized themselves to the beeping, still chanting its call from the console on his desk.  Reese swore a second time, quietly, before rolling to the edge of his bed. Familiar pain spiked, and his mind swam, but Lieutenant Reese Kett was a practiced hand at navigating the minefield of an early morning hangover. 

He sank into his desk chair, popping a pair of pain-killers before chugging a full bottle of the electrolyte-rich sports drink he had left next to the pills the night before. He quietly thanked the advances in modern over-the-counter medicine as the pain was washed away, but the Fog of lingering inebriation would remain for a little while longer. He finally silenced the incessant beeping by opening the urgently marked message arriving on the wings of official US army channels. *Odd, usually this heads to the CO. Oh, right. He’s on leave, So what could possibly be so impor…”*  Reese never finished the thought as the contents of the Urgent message played into his Army-issued Cochlear Augmented Universal Monitors, the United Terran answer to cutting-edge air, land, sea, and space-born individual communications devices. The hyper-microprocessor revolution of half a century prior proved the CAUM, pronounced comm, provided the audio that accompanied the shocking images from Sol system’s resource-rich Kuiper Belt mining operations.

Kett could only look on in shock and horror. The images were from the command center of a Glencore Habitation and Command Station. A bright flash heralded the arrival of… something. A triplicate of Orbs, fused with a thick oval ring, exited the anomaly. Alarms wailed, and futile orders barked, but this newcomer was never there to talk. Bright lances of energy flared from the edges of the newcomer’s exterior ring. The Camera was recording the forward observation port; and was given a front seat to one of those vibrant green blades of energy that slice cleanly through it, severing the bodies of a third of the crew inside the command center. Half of the survivors were set ablaze as the blast superheated the air inside, but they did not burn long, and the crippled Port failed.

Lieutenant Reese Kett watched the inferno surge, being blown out into the void. A silent prayer escaped his lips as the video died, replaced by scrolling data, and fresh orders buttoned up the end of the urgent transmission. Moments later, his personal device rang. Kett stood, the last of the previous night’s festivities violently burned away by the images now seared into his memory forever, and reached into the hanging jacket to recover the device. He recognized the number, instantly knew what happened, “Hey Frank.”

Over 1000 miles away, Captain Francis Knight had just stepped away from an early morning Coffee date with his wife on the sands of Key West, “You’ve seen it?” a deep sigh groaned over the other end of the call, \*Yea, I did….. God rest their souls. What’s your ETA?\* Captain Frank Knight nodded mentally, His XO was clearly taking care to watch the information he disclosed over an unsecured line. “I’ve got a jumper flight in 45 minutes. Brass wants us mobilized within the week. I’ll see you on base this evening.” \*Damn, How’s the old lady and the kids taking it?\* Frank turned toward the shoreline, watching his wife regard him with a knowing gaze. *God, She’s gorgeous.* The thought flit through his mind just as every personal device in his immediate presence, and he suspected across the globe, began beeping and buzzing wildly, “I think it just got out, and now I get to go tell her. Wish me luck.”

 

A hoarse chuckle ripped itself from Reese’s chest, “I’ll have Doc meet you at the airfield.” He could hear the choking laugh over the device, \*Fuck you, Lieutenant\* was all Frank responded with before closing the connection. He turned just in time to be impacted by a familiar lithe frame. “How long?” Julie Knight whispered into Frank’s ear. Frank wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close and breathing in deeply. Even now, the scent of her hair seemed to draw even the tensest stress from his body, “I don’t know, but it’s bad. People are dead, a lot of people.” Julie returned his embrace before pulling back to look into his eyes, “Can you tell me who?”

Frank returned her searching gaze before glancing down at his now wildly vibrating personal device, “I can’t, but….” He opened the message containing a video link from the national news. He tilted the screen to show her and pressed play.

 Fort Campbell: 7July2640 1300 local

The room was quickly filling, and First Sergeant Mike “Darth” Silverston quickly settled into his seat. Today was not a day for the usual antics. His squad was quickly arriving, a mix of veterans and fresh enlistees alike. Private Jacob “Jace” Pleenco was the first to arrive, followed by Peter “Peppy” Thompson, and Markus “Trey” Collins. Specialist Bill “Stetson” Harrison settled into the seat next to him, “Sarn’t.” Was all he said, his face creased with distracted worry, and Mike understood why. Stetson was the grandson of a wildly successful oil family that saw the winds of change and reached for the Kuiper belt. The wide-brimmed hat he wore on days off proved a not-so-subtle hint to his origins, but Bill had taken a severe tongue lashing at his decision to avoid the family business and join up. That said, his growing up proved to provide, even here, and Stetson proved himself quickly as a demolitions and explosives expert. That didn’t keep the deep creases of worry from the Titanic Texan’s features. He had family out there, and by the looks of it, many were still missing.  Trevor “Seasick” Johnson and Xavier “Oddball” Corbon were the last of Darth’s squad to arrive, along with the last few stragglers just before the doors shut and locked.

Captain Frank Knight’s boots thumped a somber, rhythmic dirge on their way up to the podium, and a heavy, dangerous intensity settled over the company. A new addition gave a small fidget here, or there; but the very public headlines curtailed even the freshest of boots from missing the reason for their assembly. Captain Knight took the measure of the room, then tapped a key on the podium, “Men of the 10^(th) Terran.” His booming voice silences the last of the murmurs. “By now, you have seen the headlines, and you know that we have been attacked by another intelligent space-faring species. The age-old question of whether we are alone in this universe has its grim answer.” The Captain keyed another control, and the massive vessel with three interconnecting globes and an oblong ring snapped into view on the holoprojectors, “I regret to say that the station was indeed completely destroyed, and chaplains are available at the leisure of anyone who may have had family aboard. I also regret to inform you that these beings chose an artillery bombardment rather than a boarding action,” Knight keyed into existence a new set of images. “These are recordings from the United Terra sensor net.” The entire room watched as every escape pod, every fragment of the station big enough to hold survivors, and the same energy beam systematically obliterated every asteroid emitting energy signals or signs of life. Then, and only then, did small landing craft launch. “It has been decided that these Aliens mean to strip us of our resources at a minimum, or worse, erase us from existence.” A hushed murmur returned, but only for a moment as the Captain raised a hand. “I understand your reaction. This is not the first contact we had hoped for, and it appears that these Aliens may have found us by backtracking Voyager 1.” The silence was complete at this point, and the podium creaked under the captain’s grip. Spines stiffened, and eyes hardened at the set on Frank Knights face as he spoke, “Men of the 10^(th) Terran, let me remove the last questions from your mind. Each and every one of you were picked from the best of the American and European branches of the United Terran Military. We all know our mission, to counter Mars should we fight, to drop into the void and dare it to swallow you, force it to blink as it stares back at you. The Lord knows that almost happened many times over, but this!” He pointed to the images still hovering in the air behind him. “This boys… this changes EVERYTHING!” Frank Knight’s fury assailed them, each syllable a hammer forged in terrible promise. “Mars is with us, Terra is with us, Humanity is with us. In 4 days, we set sail for Kuiper. These Aliens wish to strip our home bare and murder our kin. So, I ask you this one question… FORGET dropping into hell, boys… WHO among YOU is ready!! READY to bring HELL with you! WHO among you is to ride on the wings of Damnation itself!” The room erupted, the last 48 hours of shock, horror, and anguish poured into one purpose. The 10^(Th) Terran was going to war.

 

Houston International Transit Station 11July2640: 0825 Local

First Lt Michael “Blazzin” Dawes stepped onto the loading platform of Concourse Charlie. He shifted uncomfortably in the low centrifugally imparted gravity of the aging pre-artificial gravity station. His duffel seemed to almost float on his shoulder, despite it weighing almost 80 lbs. on Terra. Soon enough, he found what he was looking for, and Mike quickly stepped over to a grizzled-looking Sergeant wearing Alpha Company patches. “Sergeant Benjamin Freedman,” The Grizzled man turned with a quick appraising nod and a salute, “Lieutenant Dawes, I see you made it alright. Th’ boys are already aboard.” He handed a data pad to the Lieutenant. “Let's see,” Mike mused, “I can confirm,” he knew he didn’t need to, but Dawes was the youngest and newest Lieutenant in the 10^(th), and he needed to practice everything he could, while he could.

 

He had joined the 10^(th) Terran less than a year ago, a fresh set of butter bars on his shoulder. He knew his men, but he also knew that the veterans in Alpha regarded him as ‘untested’. He felt it. The Sergeant at his shoulder had seen two pirate interdiction deployments and participated in the liberation of Ceres station from a radical Oligarch who was attempting to build an R.F.G. “Rod from God” meant for Terra. About a third of the men under his command came from similar backgrounds, having been blooded in the tumultuous 20-year beginning period of Human expansion inside their own solar system. Mars was much older, settled nearly 300 years prior, but many historians did not count her. The true beginning of Human expansion came with the invention of NFTL, or Near Faster Than Light, technology. This discovery came in two parts. First, the engines to propel spacecraft at relativistic speeds, and the field generation technology to keep everyone aging the same as real space. These two groundbreaking breakthroughs, two decades ago, had gifted Humanity the Kuiper Belt, and the rest of the Sol System. Sadly, the Light Speed Barrier appeared to remain intact, at least for humanity, and Lieutenant Dawes was not looking forward to the extended voyage promised. “Lieutenant?” Freedman’s question pulled Dawes from his thoughts, “Freed, I told you; it's Blazzin when we’re in the field.” Sergeant Freedman simply nodded, “Whatever you say, Lieutenant, but we depart in 5.” Dawes looked down at his watch, an ancient timepiece handed down from father to son in his family, “I see. Shall we?” He responded, and the two started down the boarding corridor, boarding the TNS Saratoga just as the departure alarms began to blare.

 

Moring clamps detached, sending a shudder through the 5-mile-long vessel. Fresh from her Refit, Saratoga’s wide, flat, angular hull bore a fresh coat of sensor-confusing stealth coating. The shore power umbilical was the last to detach, breaking away, cleaning as Saratoga’s sharply raked prow swung ‘round as she lay to course. The titanic super carrier would be the Heart of 8^(th) Fleet’s Battle Group Charlie, cobbled together from available vessels. Terra’s reach for the stars had resurrected hallowed names from Humanity’s history upon their cradle world’s vast oceans, and Saratoga was but one of the legendary names called upon to provide both shield and sword in Humanity’s aid.

 

Saratoga’s main drives flared to life in earnest, burning hard from the grasp of the homeworld, but she was not alone. TNS Indefatigable, a 7-mile-long Dreadnought-class warship, pulled alongside Saratoga’s port beam, with TNS New Jersey, another Dreadnought, mirroring Indefatigable’s position to Starboard. Ahead of the trio, TNS Destroyers Daring, Antelope, O’Bannon, and Kidd settled into their advanced positions at the fore of the formation, while TNS Fletcher and Antelope screened their rear. In two weeks, Battle Group Charlie would meet with the 3^(rd) Royal Martian Fleet group Orion, whose composition remained a mystery to Saratoga and her cohorts. Terra and Mars boasted a long, checkered relationship; each one holding their technological advancements close to the chest. In the wake of the Slaughter of over 100 thousand, both Martian and Terran had ended that competition. In two weeks, a three-century-long cold war would end, and Rivals would unite over Titan before departing for vengeance.

 

Prospect 8943785127: 28004.61

Kixere’Gor stood from his command position, a thronelike resting place that rose above the segmented pits that divided Command deck systems and duties aboard the Mik’iriz Veerkan (Eternal Victory). Subordinates bustled below him, each one refusing to look up to him, both a sign of respect… and one of fear. Kixere’s four legs spun his 4-meter-tall, narrow torso smartly around, and he measured his pace to a menacing march while he departed the bridge. One of his three arms reached for the refreshment console inside of his ready room, ordering his evening meal. Moments later, his triple-segmented Mandibles spread, tearing into fresh if vacuum damaged flesh. His subordinates would have to wait, but as the Lord Master of the Mik’iriz Veerkan, It was his right by the old codes to taste of the flesh of the defeated at his pleasure. It was the I’Krian Principality way It was a shame that none survived the bombardment. The living were so much more delicious than the frozen dead.

 

Kixere mused over the after-action reports, comparing them to the intelligence He had been given for this expedition. A Deathworld full of primitive Sapiens; how they survived their cradle to reach for the stars was the Void’s own mystery. It mattered little, It was clear they were fleeing their home, desperately reaching for the edges of their cradle system. The Military installations he had effortlessly obliterated were pathetically under protected and barely armed. If this was the might of these “Humans”, then bringing their world to the heel of the Principality would not require the vast resources brought to bear in this backwater hellhole. He perused the intelligence package once more. Extreme gravity, dangerous weather anomalies, poisonous plants, and lethal animals. The Species that survived that world should have put up more of a contest, but it mattered not. He was meant to be but the spy, merely here to scout and report back.

 

The ludicrous nature of what he had discovered demanded Kixere act, and his attack had proven a wild success. His meager scouting vessel single-handedly carved the foothold required to secure the arrival of the main fleet. The console beeped, announcing the same fleet’s arrival, and Kixere chose another morsel, activating the holographic projectors inside his office. The Sensor feed from his vessel flashed into existence just as a triplicate of moons arrived with the same bright flash of subspace rupture. These moons, captured eons ago and painstakingly converted into the mother vessels the I’Krian used at the core of their voidborn forces. V’Keees Xoor (Superior Hand), Wixri’anir (Subjugation), and Mu’xirin Vak’ralen (Hallowed Destruction) each carried over 100,000 single-seat fighter and attacker aircraft, but they did not deploy them. Mother vessels were the only vessels capable of crossing the great expanses between the stars. The key to the Principality's dominance, the Quantum Subspace Render, was small enough to be put into even a small vessel such as Kixere’s, and the unique mission set of his command required its installation. The QSR’s power requirements relegated such combinations to incredibly short ranges. The Mother ships were the only vessels in the Principality's possession capable of transiting the length of the Principality’s territory.

 

One mother vessel was a death sentence for those who opposed the Principality, and Kixere watched entire warships undock and deploy from all three. Whatever the Principality had acquired from their information exchange with the Vilgrian Infogarchy had obviously spooked his betters. Kixere closed the hologram feed just as the 1300^(th) warship was deployed from the third Mother vessel, leaning back to finish his meal. *No matter, such an overreaction undoubtedly will improve the review of my actions here.* The thought carried him through to desert, a delectable blood pudding. These sapiens were truly delicious.

Went to the community garden on sat morning with coffee and sat on the bench listening to birds. I decided after a few minutes to take a recording of the sounds for my relatives who all live in a big city and don't hear nature sounds as often. This is something I do sometimes to show them what I'm up to. Anyway, I was recording an amazing birdsong when 30 seconds in, this random dog starts barking and doesn't stop even after I leave 10 minutes later. WTF? Why is your dog allowed to make so mych noise for so long at 7 AM outside?

You know they call the cops on hispanic neighbors playing party music at 6 PM when everyone's actually up doing things.

But their dog gets to bark incessantly for attention whenever, wherever and that's just nAtuRAl. The dog doesn't know any better and needs time to playyy. Just get over it! It's not like the dog is an actual sound cannon blaring constant noise, he has to take breaths in between barks so just enjoy that time as peace and quiet.",18,1746535993.0,Dogfree,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Thailand for the past 12 years, and I recently took a trip to Vietnam for the first time – specifically Hanoi. Spent two weeks there and honestly, I was a bit apprehensive before going. I’d heard from multiple people (both online and in real life) that northern Vietnamese, especially in Hanoi, could be rude, unfriendly, or even scammy. That really set my expectations low.

But now that I’m back, I can say that wasn’t my experience at all. Quite the opposite, actually. I found people in Hanoi to be super friendly and open. I had lots of great conversations with locals – from coffee shop owners to random people I met in parks or on the street. Everyone seemed genuinely kind, curious, and willing to chat.

In the full two weeks I was there, I didn’t have a single bad interaction or feel like anyone was trying to rip me off. Of course, like any big city, you need to keep your wits about you, but overall I felt very welcome.

Just wanted to share my positive experience because I feel like the bad reputation some people give northern Vietnamese isn’t fair or at least isn’t always accurate. Anyone else have a similar or different experience?",27,1746535969.0,VietNam,11,0.89,False

In my recent visit to Nepal, my observation is very salty and sour. Not sure why this time I felt so bad. Maybe it is the contrast between potential and reality or the silence behind the noise. Either way what I saw left me unsettled and deeply reflective.

1. The Overworked and Overwhelmed

There is a large segment of youth who have become part of the daily grind working long hours with little time for family life. These individuals often leave home at 9 AM and return at 7 PM and only repeat the cycle after a dinner, sex and sleep. Their dreams are often buried under the weight of responsibility.

2. The Unrealistic Dreamers

School-going children are often filled with lofty dreams becoming influencers, celebrities or CEOs but many of these aspirations lack grounding in reality. A mismatch between the education system and real world challenges has left many of them chasing shadows rather than preparing for tangible success.

3. The Politically Entangled College Crowd

College students, often seen as agents of change, are caught in ideological battles divided between support for the monarchy and anti monarchy. These views are frequently shaped not by informed discourse but by short videos from TikTok and social media, giving rise to a false sense of power and influence.

4. The Economic Migrants

Then there are those who never had the chance to attend college. With limited opportunities at home, they find themselves in lines at Tribhuvan Airport, passports in hand, heading to labor markets in Dubai, Qatar or Malaysia.

5. The Burned-Out Professionals

Even among the educated, the struggle is real. Young doctors, once seen as symbols of hope, are now battling depression, often resorting to medication to cope with the mental and emotional toll of their profession. Burnout is no longer a bs it is a reality.

6. The Relaxed Educators

Teachers, who should be the guiding force for the next generation, seem detached in some cases. Without drive or motivation, some have settled into a passive rhythm, disconnected from the urgency of reform or inspiration.

7. The Consumerist Youth

Meanwhile, the cafe culture in cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara shows a contrasting picture. Trendy spots are packed with young people who seem unbothered paying Rs. 300 for a cup of coffee. This surge in consumerism creates the illusion of high purchasing power and prosperity, masking deeper socioeconomic disparities.

8. The Emotionally Divided Abroad

And then there are those who live abroad working or studying. Their hearts and minds are split in two and are unable to fully belong to the new country and unable to fully accept Nepal. This emotional tug of war surfaces often especially when listening to ""Yo mann ta mero Nepali ho"". Their identity is a balancing act between pride and pain, home and away.

Baby is 14 weeks old and is currently home with my husband who is taking his leave now. I am a high school teacher, so in about a month I'll be on summer break and husband will go back to work while I hang with baby. He will then start daycare in August before the new school year. 

I had such a good first day back! It felt amazing to put on my cute work clothes, some jewelry, and do my hair. My colleague brought in coffee and pastries, and my students and coworkers were so happy and excited to see me! It was really sweet! I enjoyed a hot cup of coffee and went to the bathroom without worrying about a hollering baby, lol! And when I got home I was soooo excited to see my son and had the energy to really engage with him, rather than being burnt out from his care all day. 

It helps a lot that baby is home with his father and that I'll be on summer relatively soon. I am sure it also helps that I truly LOVE my job and get so much self-actualization through teaching. 

Anyway, I just wanted to post this to bring some positivity to returning to work! I know there will be hurdles in the future and daycare illnesses to contend with, but I think I will be a good working mom! ",5,1746535807.0,workingmoms,0,1.0,False

Also periodic night sweats. Also periodic period spotting. Oh and my right pupil became huge when I started drinking coffee to stay awake after a few months. And weight gain of about 5kg.

Dr scared the daylights out of me saying pupil thing “could be the big C”, sent me for an MRI which came back clear thank goodness. (Didn’t bother to call me back, I found out it was fine via the app .. but that’s another vent!)
I’ve seen a gp for all of the other symptoms as well and she did a general blood test which came back normal. She hasn’t called me back/suggested anything else— so I assume this is all just side effects and she isn’t worried!

My Nespresso recently gave out, so I’ve been making my coffee with a stovetop moka pot. It’s drinkable, but a bit inconvenient since I have to keep an eye on it to prevent it from overflowing.

I just found a deal on a Philips 5500 series superautomatic for around $475 USD (brand new and authentic), and I’m considering the upgrade. However, I’ve never owned a superautomatic machine before, and I have a couple of concerns:
	1.	Taste: Will the coffee be as strong and rich as with a stovetop method?
	2.	Durability & Maintenance: I’ve heard these machines can be finicky and might break down easily if not maintained well. I’m worried about it failing after just a few months.

My main question is:
If you own or have owned a Philips superautomatic espresso machine, how long has it lasted and how satisfied were you overall? Would you recommend it to someone used to strong stovetop coffee?

Thanks in advance!

# Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant: 2025 Best Care Guide

The Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant, scientifically known as *Anthurium andraeanum*, is a popular houseplant prized for its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe and spadix. This tropical beauty adds a touch of elegance and color to any indoor space. Understanding the specific needs of this plant is crucial for ensuring its long-term health and blooming success.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant boasts several distinct features that contribute to its unique appeal and relatively easy care requirements.

**Vibrant Spathe and Spadix:** The most striking feature of the Anthurium is its modified leaf, the spathe, which comes in various colors, including red, pink, white, and even green. The spadix, a fleshy spike protruding from the spathe, is where the actual flowers are located.

The spathe's waxy texture adds to its visual appeal, reflecting light and enhancing its color. The spadix, often yellow or white, contrasts beautifully with the spathe, creating a stunning visual display. The size and shape of the spathe can vary depending on the cultivar, ranging from small and delicate to large and dramatic.

**Heart-Shaped Leaves:** The Anthurium also features large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that provide a lush, green backdrop to the vibrant flowers. These leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly leathery texture.

The leaves contribute significantly to the plant's overall aesthetic appeal. They are generally 6-12 inches long and wide, providing ample surface area for photosynthesis. Proper care, including adequate light and humidity, is essential for maintaining the health and vibrancy of these leaves.

**Air-Purifying Properties:** Like many houseplants, the Anthurium possesses air-purifying qualities. It helps remove common household toxins from the air, contributing to a healthier indoor environment.

The plant filters pollutants such as formaldehyde, xylene, and ammonia from the air, improving air quality. This makes the Anthurium not only a beautiful addition to your home but also a beneficial one. Placing an Anthurium in your living room or bedroom can help create a cleaner and more refreshing atmosphere.

**Relatively Low Maintenance:** While the Anthurium requires specific care, it is generally considered a low-maintenance houseplant compared to some other tropical varieties. Its adaptability to indoor environments and relatively infrequent watering needs make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts.

The plant is relatively forgiving of occasional neglect, making it suitable for individuals with busy lifestyles. However, consistent attention to its basic needs, such as proper watering, lighting, and humidity, is essential for optimal growth and blooming.

Key features of the Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant include:
* Vibrant spathe and spadix in various colors
* Glossy, heart-shaped leaves
* Air-purifying properties
* Relatively low maintenance requirements

 ## Core Benefits

The Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant offers several practical benefits, making it a desirable addition to any home or office.

**Enhanced Aesthetics:** The vibrant colors and unique shape of the Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant instantly elevate the aesthetic appeal of any space. Its glossy leaves and striking flowers create a focal point that adds a touch of elegance and sophistication.

The plant's beauty enhances the overall ambiance of a room, creating a more inviting and welcoming atmosphere. Whether placed on a windowsill, desk, or coffee table, the Anthurium adds a splash of color and visual interest to any setting.

**Improved Air Quality:** As mentioned earlier, the Anthurium's air-purifying properties contribute to a healthier indoor environment. By removing common household toxins, it helps create a cleaner and more refreshing atmosphere.

This benefit is particularly valuable for individuals with allergies or respiratory sensitivities. By filtering out pollutants, the Anthurium helps reduce the risk of irritation and improves overall well-being.

**Stress Reduction:** Studies have shown that houseplants can have a positive impact on mental health, reducing stress and promoting relaxation. The Anthurium's vibrant colors and natural beauty can create a calming and soothing effect, helping to alleviate stress and improve mood.

The act of caring for a plant can also be therapeutic, providing a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Spending time tending to your Anthurium can be a relaxing and rewarding experience, helping you unwind and de-stress after a long day.

**Long-Lasting Blooms:** With proper care, the Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant can produce blooms that last for several weeks, or even months. This extended blooming period provides long-lasting beauty and enjoyment.

Unlike some flowering plants that only bloom for a short time, the Anthurium offers a continuous display of color and vibrancy. This makes it a cost-effective and sustainable choice for adding beauty to your home or office.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about Anthurium Flamingo Flower Plant care:

**How often should I water my Anthurium?**
   Water your Anthurium when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot. Generally, watering once a week is sufficient, but this may vary depending on the humidity and temperature of your environment. Ensure the pot has good drainage to prevent water from sitting at the bottom.

**What type of light does an Anthurium need?**
   Anthuriums thrive in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves. A north- or east-facing window is ideal. If you don't have access to natural light, you can supplement with a grow light.

**How do I encourage my Anthurium to bloom?**
   To encourage blooming, provide your Anthurium with bright, indirect light, consistent moisture, and high humidity. Fertilize regularly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Remove any spent flowers to encourage new growth.

**Is the Anthurium plant toxic to pets?**
   Yes, the Anthurium is toxic to pets if ingested. It contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation of the mouth, tongue, and throat. Keep the plant out of reach of pets and children. If you suspect your pet has ingested part of the plant, contact your veterinarian immediately.

The Anthurium stands out with its vibrant colors and unique heart-shaped flowers, offering a more visually striking display compared to the Peace Lily's primarily white blooms. While Orchids offer a wider variety of colors and shapes, they require more specialized care than Anthuriums. For users seeking a relatively low-maintenance flowering plant with a bold and colorful aesthetic, the Anthurium provides a better balance of beauty and ease of care.

During 2016, I went to the same coffee shop almost everyday, after work. A very traditional coffee shop (the oldest coffee shop in town, could be read on the wall outside) that had a slight modern twist, thanks to its relatively young staff.

The youngest of them, at one point, started blasting spotify, playing a mix of his liking.

Those were the first times I heard ""Let it Happen"". And I say ""first times"" because I couldn't immediately identify the song or artist, but I was thrilled with the sound, and it took me several weeks before I brought myself to shazaam the song, because it was constantly stuck in my head and refused to go away.

From the moment I learned what it was, I was hooked to it, listening to the song every chance I got. After a couple of weeks, I got Currents, and was hoping that it had 11 other tracks like this one.

Obviously, they weren't, and I had a hard time trying to get into it, it was not like I didn't like it, but it was not clicking inside of me. Until one day (not really sure when), that it did, and I started loving the album back to back, completely obsessing over it.

I then got Innerpseaker and Lonerism, but on both of them, I would start listening, and the same thing would happen, it simply didn't click.

For Loverism, one day I saw a post of an internet-niche celebrity that I follow, stating that Lonerism was 2014's soundtrack for that person, and somehow, that made it click for me. I put the album on and immediately saw the beauty of it. Not in full form, the first half of the album was easily digested, while the second half would require some more attention to detail (nowadays I can't get enough og NTHHSFHBAWCC).

For Innerspeaker, it took a little bit longer, I was at the laundromat one night, took my earphones and just blasted it, and that was it, as for Lonerism, suddenly, the beauty of these songs was palpable, and I carried on  listening to these over, and over, and over again.

This was last year, so The Slow Rush had also already been released, and I was not aware of it, somehow. Maybe because 2020 was the pandemic, and I had a child born that year, too much going on, I guess.

Anyway, I got that one as well, and the process was similar, I started listening, little by little, one track here, another track there, until one day the songs just clicked inside of me and I instantly loved all of the album as well.

Nowadays, I listen to whatever Tame Impala I can get my hands on, I haven't been this hooked on a band since I was a teenager. I just feel so seen, the music is incredible, the lyrics are meaningful and suitable to multiple interpretations. Words fail me when I try to express just how meaningful Tame Impala is in my life at this point.

Any other people relate to my experience?=",4,1746534658.0,TameImpala,4,0.7,False

I decided to try it because it might help and couldn't hurt, but didn't have high expectations for results--I know it doesn't work for everyone. In three weeks I have experienced:  
- Weight loss without trying. My appetite is suppressed, but not gone. I just have many fewer food cravings and the ones I indulge are satisfied by smaller amounts. I weigh myself daily but don't really pay attention to the numbers because they're stored in an app. Today I realized I've lost almost 10 lbs in three weeks. I know this pace can't/won't continue, but I was shocked.  
- Lower, more stable blood sugar levels. I track with an otc cgm, and I have reduced both spikes and lows. My average glucose is 15 lower than before I started. I wasn't pre/diabetic before, but I had reactive hypoglycemia that made life pretty miserable. That's gone.  
- No caffeine withdrawal?! I have lost my ""must have coffee"" urge in the mornings, but I was normally having some anyway. A few days I skipped it and didn't get headaches or moodiness. It was like my brain was just suddenly ok without its normal drug.  
- Increased executive function and less impulsive behavior. I have adhd that is medicated with Wellbutrin but no stimulants. It helps, but just takes the edge off. Adding Tirz has made it easier to focus and helped lessen some of my brain fog.  
- Downside: I'm so cold all the time and it feels like it's in my bones. I was expecting to be warmer due to increased metabolism, but now I know that's not how it works. Brr. ",13,1746534508.0,tirzepatidecompound,5,1.0,False

Apart from being super hypermobile, I also have Hashimoto's, and so I go to endocrynologist and get tested for hormon levels regularly, and I usually have high cortisol. The way my endocrynologist explains it is, I have super low blood pressure (because of EDS), so my body produces more cortisol to compensate for it. And so I always had high cortisol levels (judging by how I always felt super anxious, my hair started going white when I was literally 17 and so on). Not Cushing's, just the way my body works.

In the most stressful time of my life, I also gained some weight, almost exclusively in my upper body - upper back, upper arms, some on my face. And even though I'm super skinny now (underweight actually), no matter what, it just never goes away, I look absolutely ridiculous. I know it's kind of least of my concerns, but super annoying nevertheless.

If I manage to lower cortisol levels, by taking a break, relaxing more, herbal supplements and so on - I also get symptoms of low blood pressure and have absolutely no energy to do anything much.

It seems like an endless circle. I wonder if anyone had similar issues and found a way to deal with it in a more permanent way. Logically having normal blood pressure would help, but drinking coffee and exercising just isn't enough in my case, and taking more sodium leads to horrible water retention (I have Hashimoto's after all).",1,1746534492.0,ehlersdanlos,1,1.0,False

I live in Tbilisi, this is important as simplifies starting a legal business, and costs are much lower. I believe starting it on 20,000 is feasible if I do the renovations myself.

Thing is I am bad at this kind of thing. I’ve always been a hands on person, give me something broken and I. Can fix it. Give me a business to run and I’ll run it into the ground. I think. 


I started a course on udacity called “how to build a startup” which recommended I read the book “the startup owners manual”.

I am doing both of these things.

But I still wonder if the idea itself is just bad. 

I see revenue coming from this from coffee, maybe food, Books, and running English language clubs in the bus, maybe a book club and ttrpg’s. 

I already run paid ttrpg’s here in Tbilisi and have built a community over several years of players. I also know that English clubs are big here. I believe these will fill up with good marketing (no idea what that involves), as for the coffee and books, I don’t know. Coffee culture is very big amongst expats here, particularly Russians. English books are hard to find, basically only one shop that really stocks any.

1kg352w,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioGardeners/comments/1kg352w/soil_drainage_question_from_a_newbie/,Soil drainage question from a newbie!,"Hello!

I recently decided, after being put on disability due to severe arthritis, that sitting on my ass is getting boring, and unhealthy. So I have decided to change up my backyard to get me off my widening ass and get busy.

My backyard is huge for a townhouse, I'm an end-unit next to a walking path. The lawn slopes towards the path abruptly leaving me with approximately 500 square meters of mostly flat backyard to play with. An arborist told me that my backyard is mostly clay and non-draining, and that's the problem. My wife and I need (because of a city by-law) to plant some trees to replace a couple of unwanted trees which we're having removed (I will **not** miss you, Austrian Pine).

So! My question revolves around my idea for making my soil drain better with a 'soil lasagna'. I have dug 2 spots in my backyard and added trenches towards the sloped hill. I stripped the sod and topsoil, dug down approximately 50cm, dumped in each a yard waste bag full of mulched leaves I kept from last fall into both holes, grass clippings, a bunch of old stale dry cereal, coffee grounds, etc. and topped that all with recently cut twigs, sticks, and branches up to 30-40mm, then refilled the hole. I refilled it first with the sod and topsoil, then the rest of the dirt that I dug out.

The trees need to be planted within 1 year of having my existing trees removed. I've spoken to the arborist and I'll be keeping the chipped trees to add to these dug spots.

So to finally ask my question, did I just do all of this work aggravating my arthritis for no reason? Or do I have a chance? 

Thanks!

1kg34vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1kg34vm/reflections_of_a_35year_vegas_visitor_veteran/,Reflections of a 35-year Vegas visitor veteran,"My first trip was in 1989, staying at the now-defunct Aladdin and seeing Stevie Nicks there in concert.  My 2 buddies and I, drunk and stoned, stumbled in the wee hours past the about-to-open, now-defunct Mirage and saw the volcanos erupt.  In that pre-Internet, pre-social media, era we had no idea it was even there!

I was hooked, and have returned to Vegas once or twice a year since then.  The trips have changed over the years of course- the early partying, gambling-till-dawn, skirt-chasing trips have evolved into more sedate affairs focused on golf and fine dining.  Still fun, and I still plan on coming back annually.  Some thoughts on last weekend's trip:

I have stayed in recent years at a family timeshare at the HGV at the Flamingo.  The first day I wandered over to the Flamingo Hotel to have breakfast at the counter Nook Express.  A coffee, OJ, and croissant egg sandwich with tax and tip was $40- ouch!  Didn't eat there the rest of the stay.

A buddy picked Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris to dine at on Saturday night.  The prices were eye-popping even by today's Vegas standards.  I asked the server for separate checks and he sniffed, ""we don't usually do that.  I'll have to ask my manager.""  One beer, a salad, a steak, and a side with tax and tip came to $235 (they did do separate checks).  It was good, but. . .

I am not a big nostalgia guy in general- life moves on and we have to move on with it.  I do wonder, however, how many young people today will form the ""Vegas habit"" like I did.  Sure, you can stay Downtown or off-Strip and still have a cheap vacation there- but that's a different experience from what I had in the 90's I am almost certain.  The way I sold Vegas to my friends and family  then was:  keep your gambling under control and you can have a world-class vacation for a reasonable price- the rooms, food, liquor, and entertainment are all subsidized by the gambling revenue.  I just don't think that's the case any more, more's the pity.",117,1746534247.0,vegas,40,0.94,False

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — I’ll call him George — and I’m starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I’m being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university’s library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations — mostly pro-Trump stuff — even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t drop it even when I said I didn’t want to talk about it.

I told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over unless we met in person. I still agreed to meet and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down to my level, and that I was “sounding like the devil.” He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here’s where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library yesterday. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he’d moved a couple rows forward — this time directly facing me. It felt really unsettling.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and being overly friendly in public. A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t said much — just that I’ve been busy.

Now I’m anxious that he might be sharing the personal things I confided in him, especially the mental health stuff, and trying to make me look unstable or dramatic. I feel like I’ve lost control of the narrative, and it’s really messing with my head.

AITA for cutting him off completely or should I just move on and let it be?",1,1746534052.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

I attended a local Unitarian Society on and off for some years. They were very open minded and even had an annual theist vs atheist volleyball game at their annual picnic. 

What I miss is group singing, publicly acknowledging that it’s a good idea not to be a jerk, that we have a duty of care for each other and the planet. I also miss the coffee  hour.

I have been attempting uber aberroth for the past 2 days (around 7-8 hours) and it is an absolute diarrhea of a fight. You can say get guud or call me a washed up dad gamer but I don't think this is a great boss encounter. There is so much screen cluster everywhere and so much RNG for each encounter. I've made it to the final phase 3-4 times and I am very close so I will keep going until he goes down. However, it does not feel rewarding to progress through this boss because of the RNG. Even though the fight has gotten a lot better as I learned the mechanics, I feel like the stars have to line up in my favor for me to down this boss. 

I don't know.. maybe I just need to finish my coffee and come back later but I just wanted to vent my frustration somewhere and provide my feedback. Hopefully in a few more hours I will succeed... wish my luck ",0,1746533848.0,LastEpoch,14,0.38,False

before park cafes went trendy it was a good place to get a cheap vegi sausage beans and chips...the choice is a bit posher these days.

1kg2yuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddisonsDisease/comments/1kg2yuw/morning_routine_thats_finally_working_after_20/,Morning Routine That's Finally Working - After 20+ Years With Addison's,"Hi,

Long time Addison's sufferer (20+ years). I also have ADHD symptoms.

Having struggled enormously getting up in the mornings for a long time, due to a combination of exhaustion, and decision paralysis / poor executive function - I thought I would share the routine that works best for me.

As you probably know - *stable blood sugar levels* are important with Addison's. If I go to bed on an empty stomach, there's a good chance I'll wake up exhausted or hit a wall. I've had this happen *too many times* to count.

Its harder for us to wake up anyway - cortisol doesn't hit our systems until we've taken our medication and its had time to work. (This will depend on your type of Addison's of course, your type of replacement therapy,  and whether your body still produces some - mine doesn't)

Prednisolone has a longer duration - but takes longer to absorb than hydrocortisone - so if you take it at, e.g. 7am - you likely won't feel its effects till around 8am or later.

The Routine:

It starts the day before:

1. A Late night snack. (Slow-release, healthy). I have a Nairn's wholemeal oat cookie , with a bit of peanut butter.  I    put a tiny bit of salt on it. Its the very last thing I do before brushing my teeth and bed.

This snack will slowly digest overnight, and keep your blood sugar up till the morning.

Its common for us to need a bit more salt average, to feel better.  I used to meet that need in an unhealthy way by craving crisps - now I just add a bit more consciously

Caveat - you still need to be mindful you don't have TOO much salt. I'm talking a small amount.

2. Alarm for 8am.

3. Small fridge right next to my bed. Inside:

* All my pills in a pill box, for each day of the month.
* Fresh Milk
* Plain oat cookies in it.

4. Cheap filter coffee machine with a timer (£40) on top of the fridge, with an empty mug next to it:

So when I wake, I am \*invited\* out of bed with the smell of hot coffee, and the lure of an oat cookie - rather         than beaten out by the unpleasantness of exhaustion, an alarm, and another work day.

Why its working:

* The oat cookie and peanut butter before bed, has made me consistently more energised in the morning. (I don't feel so 'dead to the world').
* Because the cookie and pills are *right there*, I don't have to think - I don't get decision paralysis- I immediately get a coating of food in my stomach, and my prednisolone.
* Because its *right there* I'm not relying on memory or willpower. *I won't forget*. This means - 1 hour after taking it, the cortisol is kicking in, and I start to feel like a normal person would.

Just sharing in case it helps anyone!

Caveats:

\-I'm not a doctor - always speak to a doctor first, - and always EDUCATE yourself on your condition. The more you know, the better prepared you are to deal with what your body goes through.

\-This routine works for me , you need to figure out what works *for you.*",8,1746533733.0,AddisonsDisease,4,0.91,False
