What happened? Well, I have viral rhinopharyngitis, and I was supposed to take meds for that, but I dont have money until next week so I decided to just...wing it. Power through the sickness. And thats when I decided to take a random pill I found on my vanity.

Why did I trip? Maybe because I was already having floaty feelings on my body or maybe because I tried to use the things I sell in the store to cure my symptoms (spoiler: that made it worse) or maybe because I was desperate to sleep so I took a huge dose of melatonin to sleep (510 mg to be exact, yes, they sell that high) and it all just combine.

How do I feel? Horrible. I have been spitting/puking white foamy saliva, have horrible stomach issues (gassy, acidic reflux, less hunger). I have no sense of smell or taste, my tongue feels both burnt and waxy, while my water tasted like burnt coffee.

Why I didnt go to a doctor sooner? I dont have insurance yet, I technically have it, but I havent been able to get a clinic so I couldnt go sooner. My diagnosis was made by a doctor on a pharmacy, and that is the best I could get.

I still went to work, I completed my shift, so Im hoping that I will get my payment in full. Sorry for the rambling on the last post, and I hope this one is more readable than the last lol

TL;DR: I was ""stupi"" and got high by mixing a bunch of things trying to get healthy again.",0,1750648685.0,tifu,0,0.5,False

Any kind of comment (even a harsh one) would help me a lot so I really appreciate if you guys could spend a few minutes on this!!. I’m currently developing an AI-powered assistant aimed at helping architects and project managers simplify the time consuming change-order process. Here is what it does:

1. Takes in a base document (something like a sheet in pdf format) that you would fill out for outlining the specifications of a building
2. AI is going to analyze the pdf and ask some questions about it
3. Takes in a recording from a meeting and AI is going to read the transcript of it and analyze
4. Populates an updated version of the document with all the chnages that are fetched from the meeting recording.

The prototype I built only does a part of the features that I described above but the workflow above is what I think that could help you guys a lot and I would like honest opinions about it. (Please be brutal and straight up, I am ready for it!!)  
here is the vide of the prototype: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rhSqJ8lo-KbqQ5Bx2klA871wYkBPOWP\_/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rhSqJ8lo-KbqQ5Bx2klA871wYkBPOWP_/view?usp=sharing)

**Two small favors:**

1. **A quick survey** (takes just 3–4 minutes, quicker if you're fueled by coffee!) to help me understand your pain points better. Plus, it might give you a fresh perspective on your own workflow challenges! Here’s the link: [https://forms.gle/Htv3S5BKVBYkcjZv8](https://forms.gle/Htv3S5BKVBYkcjZv8)

The AL Perfecto was a great “for the morning” smoke. With black coffee, the dark chocolate from this was outstanding. It smelled slightly fruity before lighting and was slights spicy the whole smoke. Initially, the draw *was* slightly difficult through the first third, but as I smoked, it became really easy to smoke this cigar! A solid medium to full bodied stick for sure. 

The Curivari RL was a really good late afternoon smoke. The wrapper was beautifully dark, and it did not disappoint as my second Nicaragua puro of the day. It did crack a bit on first light, but this soon corrected itself. Quite a bit of smoke from this cigar matched the nice burn that I had throughout – though I didn’t seem to be able to hold the ash on this cigar very long until just about at the end.

1li63x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JetLagTheGame/comments/1li63x1/we_played_hide_and_seek_in_toronto_and_made_an/,We played Hide and Seek in Toronto - and made an Episode!,"My two teenage sons and I played the home game of Hide and Seek in Toronto over Father's day weekend while visiting from Colorado. I've posted some thoughts on the experience below, but first - my son Daniel decided to produce a full show inspired by Jet Lag from the experience, and the **first episode just dropped**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcjx\_iC73xY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcjx_iC73xY)

Something to watch while you wait for the next (real) episode on Wednesday! 

Now, as for our experience...   
Some notes on the rules and prep for the game:

* We played on the subway and tram lines - no buses or trains. We created a bounding box of an area about 50 sq mi in size, but had  > 100 stations including all tram stops.
* We made a printed map using Google Maps with transit layer, put it in Photoshop and added a scale then resized to fit a Legal size paper. You can see a copy here: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/edvr6pzKMGWPqoBUA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/edvr6pzKMGWPqoBUA)  \- feel free to use it if you play in Toronto. The scale made it easy to measure with a compass and you'll see us carrying the paper map on a clipboard in the video
* We made some minor rule modifications based on the play area and some tabletop games we did before departing:
   * **Played using the ""small"" rules EXCEPT** with a 45 minute hiding time, AND all of the Medium seeker questions allowed (photos, tentacles, etc) to help speed things along
   * **3 hr hard limit on each hider** \- we wanted to ensure that all 3 of us could hide in the single day we had to play. Our plan was to use ""seekers final distance from hider"" as the tiebreak if multiple people went 3 hrs (did not end up being needed)
   * **We eliminated measuring options where everywhere in the play area would be closest to a single location** (Airport, Border, Mountain, Amusement park). The reason is that with a single possible measuring spot, these all turn into thermometers that can easily be used to split the play area in half, which we didn't think was their intent. *Thermometers are very powerful!* 
   * The hangman curse words have to exist on the [official wordle word list](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-list/wordle-word-list) (we didn't want any insanely obscure words). We never got this curse.

Overall the day went very well and we had a fantastic time. I'm not going to give a play-by-play because you can watch the videos if you're interested. I will provide some thoughts/suggestions/ideas for anyone looking to play themselves.

* **Get in shape!** Our game day ended up about 11 hours in total with over 35K steps. It was both physically and mentally exhausting! 
* **Prepare ahead of time** \- having the printed map, a compass and ruler for both sides, clear location-specific rules, and some practice tabletop games made thing run pretty smoothly overall. We used Discord for comms and Google Maps location sharing for position. 
* **Matching and measuring questions can be very tricky with Google Maps** as we discovered in our table top games, and we didn't use them much during the actual game (other than Matching Transit Line which is very helpful to verify the hider's stop is on our line). The reason for this is that there are often either only one of the things (see why we eliminated Airport/Border/etc above) which makes the question too powerful, or a lot of the things, and **Google Maps doesn't always show both sides the same search results** (depending on your zoom level and its general mood). For example, in our tabletop game, we narrowed the hider to an area we though had only 2 parks, but if you zoomed in closely enough and searched for park, there was a ""parkette"" (which is marked as a Park in Google Maps) that the hider could see and the seekers weren't aware of. Similar problem with Hospital, where at a city-level zoom it looks like there are only a couple but if you zoom into neighborhoods more show up. This means that you aren't always using the same data points as each other. With enough time to prep, we might consider picking a fixed list of points for each category and marking them on a custom google map to avoid confusion.
* **Radar questions aren't very accurate in small/med games** \- They are tied to the hider's location at the time they reply - which can be gamed by moving during the reply period (within their zone). Of course this is explained in the show as a feature that can be exploited, *but you may underestimate the impact* \- with a 0.5 mi diameter hiding zone for small/med games, you have to add+subtract 0.5mi off the radius of the radar to get the ""guaranteed""  zone. **So the 1/4mi and 1/2mi radar are essentially worthless**, and the 1 mi radar is really only a 0.5 mi radar (if it's a miss). This came up in a big way in our game (not in the first episode), and we decided if we play again, we will *tie all radars to the HIDER STATION rather than HIDER LOCATION* to make them actually useful. 
* **The max question answer times (10 min for pictures, 5 min for others) can be annoying** if you are trying to run an ""efficient"" game - obviously the best hider strategy is to wait until your last second to reply, but it means that a lot of the time the seekers are just sitting around waiting for the reply to plan their next move (and the hider is waiting for the time limit to send the reply). Sometimes this can be optimized (like sending a picture request while you are riding transit) but honestly it just dragged the game out - especially in the endgame when you tend to ask multiple picture questions. In the future, I think we would consider something like a time credit system (i.e. if you reply in <10 minutes, you get bonus time on your run for the time difference) and/or reducing max response times in the endgame (1 min should be sufficient since you never have to move to reply) in order to keep the game moving. 
* **The endgame feels harder IRL than in the show** \- particularly in a dense urban area if you are trying to keep play time reasonable. There just aren't many useful questions to ask. The radars and thermometers are too large, matching/measuring is difficult (see above) so you are left with photos and tentacles. The photos have a long turn-around time (if you need 4 photos, that's 40 minutes, see above for recommendation on reducing that) and can be somewhat useless depending on where they are hiding.  Tentacles are OK but not a complete solution, and could use more categories (Park or Coffee shop would be a good ones). Adding smaller radars or an endgame only thermometer might help. I would also reduce the picture taking time for the endgame since you don't have to move to take the picture. Possibly adding some new picture types such as ""picture in both directions"" (selfie and forward in the same position) or ""picture of a random person"" (which would force them to get more background in the shot). A smaller hiding radius may work for some folks. 

That's pretty much it but happy to answer any questions. Overall Toronto was a GREAT city to play in, both large enough and safe enough to turn some teenage boys loose in for some crazy Hide and Seek fun.

1li5ytu,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1li5ytu/keg_profitability/,Keg Profitability,"I did some profitability math for the Keg and found some results that surprised me.

* Making coffee is by far the most profitable thing you can do with a Keg, IF you're willing to make 9 coffees / day / keg. ($37,785 / keg / season)
* Green Tea is the second most profitable, with the same logic, if you're willing to make 6 green teas / day / keg. ($16,800 / keg / season)
* After that the most profitable thing you can do with a Keg is actually just make Mead. (4 Honey Boxes / Keg, 1 Mead / Day, $300 / Day, 28 Mead / Season, $8400 / Season). This discounts the cost of making the Honey Box, but you only need to do that once, not once per season or even per year.

In terms of profit / keg / season, this is the next few after that:

|Crop|Product|Profit / Keg / Season|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Starfruit|Starfruit Wine|7400|
|Ancient Fruit|Ancient Fruit Wine|6600|
|Wheat|Beer|5320|
|Pumpkin|Pumpkin Juice|4340|
|Hops|Pale Ale|4140|
|Pineapple|Pineapple Wine|3600|
|Red Cabbage|Red Cabbage Juice|3395|
|Melon|Melon Wine|2680|
|Artichoke|Artichoke Juice|2310|
|Rhubarb|Rhubarb Wine|2240|
|Cauliflower|Cauliflower Juice|2191|

I guess this surprises me because I always assumed Ancient Fruit was more profitable than Starfruit, but I guess it's just more convenient that you don't have to replant your Ancient Fruit after every harvest. But on the flip side, you can get Starfruit from Calico Desert without needing to find an Ancient Seed first. Also, wheat, pumpkin, and hops aren't that far behind these exotic fruits.

The Iridium Star versions of these don't change the math, you can just double everything provided you have enough casks, except the juice. And the coffee and green tea is more profitable than even iridium star starfruit wine, but having to make 9 coffees per day per keg is a huge caveat to that.

Another crazy thing is that even if you only make 1 coffee / day / keg, it's still the same profitability as making Pale Ale, depending on how you count the cost of the coffee plant (if you pay $2500 for the coffee bean, obviously it's worse, but if you got it for free, then it's slightly better). Green Tea would fall somewhere between Melon Wine and Artichoke Juice if you only make 1 / day / keg.

In terms of profit / crop / season, Banana Trees are the best, but you need to build 7 Kegs for every Banana Tree to get it. Also that's kind of cheating since it's a tree, so it takes up more space.",5,1750647704.0,StardewValley,1,1.0,False
1li5ysv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1li5ysv,NightRider V2; the Review I Promised,"NightRider V2 by Koka Labz; the Review I promised

I was so excited to try this one, and I had it for a total of 10 hours before cracking it open.
The meaty morsels of this formula: 
•200mg DMHA
•200mg Phenibut
•200mg B-PEA
•fast acting and extended release caffeine 100mg/100mg
•Bitter Orange 50mg
•Omberacetam 25mg
•alpha yo 1mg

*Serving size is 3 capsules.*

I took it with 2 scoops of Crack Reloaded V2 which I’ve been using as my semi-daily.

I ate the caps at about 4:30am, Reloaded went down around 4:45am-ish. I try to take caps before the preworkout if I’m stacking this way.

 Long story short, I found myself in the gym, unable to leave! It took 6 police officers with pepper spray and tasers, beating me and spraying me for 5.5 minutes. One of them sicked their dogs on me (dog is dead now) and I finished up my set of chest exercises after about an hour and 30 minutes working chest and triceps.

While training, I felt lighter but also heavier at the same time. The phenibut at 200mg really shines through in this magical formula. I thought I wouldn’t feel the phenibut with it being that low but it certainly came through at 200mg . Phenibut is one of those weird things where less is more and even that depends from source to source. This is a real nice source of phenibut.

 The synergy of the DMHA and B-PEA, with the phenibut is almost too much euphoria. Crack Reloaded already has a heavy dose of Eria jarensis and BPEA, and the phenibut with the DMHA just makes this very intense, locked in focus where it was just the moment, myself, and the weights in the gym. I’m also pretty sure that the omberacetam contributed to that really strong focus.

 I’m very happy with this blend! This is one of those nice and strong, compliment capsules that is on the same level as Therma Spark; but in my opinion is better than TS! I don’t care if that’s blasphemy to some of you folks. This is one of those compliment capsules that really bring out the best in your main pre workout and also your performance in the gym. This is something you might take with a pre workout on the weekend and try to get two sessions in on that day. 
My first gym session was at 5am and that lasted 1.5 hours, my 2nd session occurred at 3pm and all I took at that time was a small cup of black coffee and the formula felt like it was rejuvenated! 

 This weekend was a trial and I’m definitely going to use this on the weekends to try and get some extra training time with. I think next weekend I’m going to run this with kill switch. I’m going to avoid other DMHA products with this because the DMHA is really nice, a perfect amount for this blend at 200mg. No more is needed.

I also feel like this formula would be something to do some other type of training with, it seems very versatile. I would even take this for some type of long day doing administrative office type work… but that’s not why I got it.

 I received this package direct from Koka Labs after a trade with my buddy in Australia, 187ummKilla. He got smash AMF from me and I got this. It was a phenomenal trade, both packages landed at their respective destinations on the same days.

I do techy kind of work and just keep to myself. Over the course of the day, most of the conversations I hear (because usually I don't talk) have two meanings. I don't really know how to explain it. It could be something as simple as, ""why isn't the coffee machine working?"", and to me, I imagine it is code language for something that I need to do later that day. My current dilemma is an ethical one. I think that I did something wrong towards a psychic (that's her business, she works in a building with a sign that describes her practice as psychic type work). I violated a boundary. It is complicated because she is the second psychic involved and both the psychics are close to each other. She sent me on a quest after that. The quest involves getting a certain item from a woman who was my love interest until she told me she is separated from her husband (I hadn't known she was still married) at which point I asked her if she could fix that relationship, because she has a big family with him. Ask me anything, I don't know where to start. My second world of delusions gets convoluted to the point of being like the movie Inception (delusion inside delusion, inside...).

I am asking this because he gets frustrated and mad at me and I don’t know what to do. I have been suffering from migraines since 2017 and I don’t wanna hurt any longer from his every day goings on. 

I am almost in  tears right now because I don’t know what to do. I know he’s frustrated. I just need something to tell him that may come from others on Reddit or a doctor although he does not believe my doctors. He especially does not believe my Johns Hopkins PhD, who teaches there and is very well known.

And it’s hard for me to make a good first impression out of the blue on the first date. Or maybe women are just too picky? Plus I’m an Asian, Chinese to be exact. I actually like to date outside of my race. But I question sometimes if women from other races feel the same way. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to date Asian girls. It’d be great too if I can meet an Asian girl one day. I always question my look. But I was told there’s nothing wrong with my look, so I shouldn’t worry too much about it. I was also told I don’t 100% behave like a Chinese. Maybe I lived in the States for too long (27 years)? I tried to meet woman/girl in real life before.

1li5rld,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1li5rld,NightRider V2 by Koka Labz; the Review I promised,"I was so excited to try this one, and I had it for a total of 10 hours before cracking it open.
The meaty morsels of this formula: 
•200mg DMHA
•200mg Phenibut
•200mg B-PEA
•fast acting and extended release caffeine 100mg/100mg
•Bitter Orange 50mg
•Omberacetam 25mg
•alpha yo 1mg

*Serving size is 3 capsules.*

I took it with 2 scoops of Crack Reloaded V2 which I’ve been using as my semi-daily.

I ate the caps at about 4:30am, Reloaded went down around 4:45am-ish. I try to take caps before the preworkout if I’m stacking this way.

 Long story short, I found myself in the gym, unable to leave! It took 6 police officers with pepper spray and tasers, beating me and spraying me for 5.5 minutes. One of them sicked their dogs on me (dog is dead now) and I finished up my set of chest exercises after about an hour and 30 minutes working chest and triceps.

While training, I felt lighter but also heavier at the same time. The phenibut at 200mg really shines through in this magical formula. I thought I wouldn’t feel the phenibut with it being that low but it certainly came through at 200mg . Phenibut is one of those weird things where less is more and even that depends from source to source. This is a real nice source of phenibut.

 The synergy of the DMHA and B-PEA, with the phenibut is almost too much euphoria. Crack Reloaded already has a heavy dose of Eria jarensis and BPEA, and the phenibut with the DMHA just makes this very intense, locked in focus where it was just the moment, myself, and the weights in the gym. I’m also pretty sure that the omberacetam contributed to that really strong focus.

 I’m very happy with this blend! This is one of those nice and strong, compliment capsules that is on the same level as Therma Spark; but in my opinion is better than TS! I don’t care if that’s blasphemy to some of you folks. This is one of those compliment capsules that really bring out the best in your main pre workout and also your performance in the gym. This is something you might take with a pre workout on the weekend and try to get two sessions in on that day. 
My first gym session was at 5am and that lasted 1.5 hours, my 2nd session occurred at 3pm and all I took at that time was a small cup of black coffee and the formula felt like it was rejuvenated! 

 This weekend was a trial and I’m definitely going to use this on the weekends to try and get some extra training time with. I think next weekend I’m going to run this with kill switch. I’m going to avoid other DMHA products with this because the DMHA is really nice, a perfect amount for this blend at 200mg. No more is needed.

I also feel like this formula would be something to do some other type of training with, it seems very versatile. I would even take this for some type of long day doing administrative office type work… but that’s not why I got it.

 I received this package direct from Koka Labs after a trade with my buddy in Australia, 187ummKilla. He got smash AMF from me and I got this. It was a phenomenal trade, both packages landed at their respective destinations on the same days.

i currently work at a part time job with unstable hours, some weeks it will be 20 hours a week and other weeks i only get 8 hours. i currently have medical and student loan debt, as well as $500 in credit card debt. i also live in a wealthier area and a lot of my friends don’t really have to deal with financial independence or debt issues, so when i tell them about this stuff they tell me to just ignore it and that i ‘worry about it’ too much. 

i only have around $7,000 dollars of debt, but i barely even have $2,000 to my name which makes it stressful. i don’t really have many expenses besides medical bills and my credit card bills. ive just been trying to save as micj money as i can. it’s just hard when you only make $140-300 a biweekly paycheck.

my main question i guess is, should i put all of my paycheck money to debt until it’s paid off instead of my savings? and should i refuse going out with friends even if they think i’m lame? i can’t really afford to do anything but pay off my debt right now. and i cant even afford a coffee. i feel like my debt has just stacked up as i got older and my savings have gotten quite low recently because i can’t save. is it better to not save any money right now and just put it towards debt or will this make the cycle repeat itself?

Well, coffee lovers unite because the latest Reddit chatter is all about this Organic SuperGreens Powder that’s supposedly changing the game. I mean, could something so simple be worth the hype? 

When I stumbled upon it, I’ll admit I was skeptical. We’ve all been there, right? You see these trendy health products that promise the world and deliver... what? A weird aftertaste? But after diving into the discussions and some personal trials, here's what I gathered:

- **Packed with Nutrients**: The consensus seems to be that these powders are loaded with everything from vitamins to antioxidants. 
- **Convenience Alert!**: Just mix it with water or toss it in your morning smoothie. Say goodbye to chopping and washing all those veggies! 
- **Energy Boosts**: People are raving about feeling more energized throughout the day. I mean, who doesn't need a little boost in the afternoon slump? 
- **Gut Health**: Some folks talked about improved digestion—goodbye, bloating! It's like *poof*, all gone. 

But here’s the kicker: **Is it as good as fresh greens?** 🤔 There’s been a lot of debate about how much of those nutrients actually translate when they’re processed into powder form. 

Also, have you ever tried something only to feel a little... iffy afterward? Definitely something to keep in mind—every body is different. 

For me, trying things like this goes hand in hand with feeling *RetirementReady*. It’s about feeling our best to enjoy the years ahead. You might think, ""Ugh, why not just eat a salad?"" But, let’s be real—some days you’re rushing out the door with a granola bar in hand!

I’ve (30F) been emotionally devastated by something that unfolded over the course of a year, and I still can’t make sense of it. I’d really appreciate your thoughts on whether what happened was simply emotionally negligent… or if it crossed professional lines.

About a year ago, I developed an increasingly close emotional connection with a pharmacist (44F) at the pharmacy I’ve used for years. It started off professionally, but she began initiating warmth—complimenting me on my appearance, telling me I looked nice, or that she liked my eye makeup. It was disorienting at first because her usual demeanor (she had been my pharmacist for around a year and a half by then) was cold, distant, and aloof. In fact, it had seemed like we both didn’t care for one another—until she gave that compliment, which surprised me.

A turning point happened when I came in crying a few months after her initial compliment—not about her or anything personal between us, but because I was asking (as a patient) how to safely taper off benzodiazepines because I wanted to have children in the future. She softened, and I began to trust her. Over the course of our connection, I told her several times she was the only one I trusted due to this encounter. It was as if she finally saw me and not just the medication and offered words of encouragement.

Almost a year later, while I was again in significant distress due to a prescription issue caused by my doctor, she gave me a single benzodiazepine—unprompted, in an unmarked bottle with no label, no prescription, and no documentation. She told me to get the correct prescription the following day. While I interpreted it as an act of kindness, I now realize it was probably a serious breach of protocol. I did get it worked out the following day and she had deducted a pill from the amount subscribed and playfully said ""you should leave a review"". I did because I was thankful and naive. After that, she never touched my prescriptions again. Another pharmacist began handling them, even as she continued to fill my mother’s.

Despite this withdrawal from a professional role in my care, our emotional closeness deepened. Over the next several months:

* She began calling me *gorgeous* and *beautiful* instead of my name.
* She brought up going to coffee twice. The first time she said I have your number, referencing the pharmacy computer. The second time was a few weeks later when she cried to me out of no where about her own infertility and stated, ""we'll talk about it when we go to coffee"" and motioned to the coffee place across the street. I slipped her my number as one grieving human being to another. She never reached out but also kept drawing me in.
* She asked about my dating life, what perfume I wore, complimented my hair and eyebrows, and once said that if I were ever at one of her parties, “all the men would run to you.”
* She shared intimate details about her shaky marriage, infertility, family, sister’s pregnancy, therapy, and even her cats.
* She asked my mother (also her patient) about me—twice. The second time, she came down from the pharmacy, asked “How is she?” and walked away. Then, a couple minutes later, she returned and asked, “How did her job interview go?”
* She opened up a little bit about her abusive ex after I told her that mine had tried to resurface in my life (I was in an emotionally abusive dynamic for 10 years with him and am still trying to heal)

Not long after, I got a new job, and she started distancing herself. She told me a coworker had recently reported her over a misunderstanding and that she had been deeply upset by it. I listened and offered support. She said she was job hunting—but that I’d be the *first to know* if she left.

A few weeks later, I went in to pick something up. When I asked a tech how *they* were doing, she immediately said, **“She’ll be here tomorrow if you want to visit...”** She hadn’t answered my question. She just mentioned my pharmacist. That told me everything—I realized even her coworkers had noticed the connection.

I took a step back.

But I eventually went back in to update my insurance. When I did, my pharmacist acted cold and indifferent—like we were strangers. I was so shaken that after walking out, I turned back and asked if I had done something wrong. I was trembling—I avoid conflict at all costs—and I didn’t even recognize who she was in that moment. She physically looked different.

She said no, then abruptly told me she was leaving the job and began oversharing. She talked about the pros and cons of her new position, how she had turned down a job involving infertility and instead took one in oncology. Then she dropped a bomb: she was a cancer survivor. I wanted to cry. She had never mentioned that before, and it shook me. My first instinct was to ask if she was okay.

She said she’d be at the job until a certain date and vaguely added that she'd decided we’d “stay in touch”—but gave no explanation of how.

At the beginning of this conversation, I had given her a heartfelt card referencing her cats by name. We had talked about them constantly. I’d recently lost my own cat, and she had come down from the pharmacy to give me a quick hug, which meant a lot in that moment of grief. The card was my way of honoring her love for her cats and that small act of kindness.

As I left, she tapped the card against my shoulder and said, “We’ll see each other before the end of the month. I’m sorry I didn’t say anything to you before.” I never saw her again. She didn’t reach out.  
I didn’t go back—I was too heartbroken, confused, and humiliated.

I keep asking:

* Was what she did wrong—ethically or emotionally?
* Was I manipulated or emotionally groomed?
* Why initiate that kind of intimacy if she was never going to follow through?
* And was the pill incident—the unmarked controlled medication—the start of a dangerous boundary collapse?

I know I didn’t imagine this connection, but the total dismissal, the silence—it’s making me question my own perception of reality. I was her younger patient, clearly dealing with the grief of infertility and struggling with anxiety and cPTSD. The connection may not make sense to others, but her openness about infertility gave me real hope in addition to all of the other things we connected on. No one else in my life—not even my mother—understands how deeply my inability to have children is destroying me. Everything she had done had led me to believe that were was genuine interest in building a connection.

This loss—this sudden withdrawal—has cut me deeply.

If anyone has insight—especially those familiar with emotional boundaries, caregiving roles, or professional ethics—I would truly appreciate your perspective.

Thank you!

**TL;DR:**  
Pharmacist gave me a controlled medication in an unmarked bottle and then emotionally drew me in—sharing personal details, calling me beautiful, crying in front of me, and initiating talks of coffee. I gave her my number and a heartfelt card; she never followed through. Then she suddenly went cold, said she was leaving her job, and I never heard from her again.

1li5f12,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1li5f12/joys_jubilee/,Joy's Jubilee,"“C’mon, Jeremy! Hurry up!” I could hear Marcus whine from the other side of the bathroom door. I simply rolled my eyes, and continued to comb my hair to perfection, and apply my cologne. I opened the door and peered down at my seven year old brother, as an expression of annoyance dominated his face. “We’re gonna be late ‘cuz of you!” He grumbled.

Dad walked by, making final preparations in the house, and ruffled his hair. “Relax, kiddo. Joy’s Jubilee isn’t going anywhere.”

I nodded, agreeing. I don’t know why Marcus is so worked up, the dumb amusement park is open until 10 tonight, and we’ll still probably make it right when it opens. I could tell there was no logic in Marcus' fidgeting and frustration. The fact of the matter to him was simple: we were supposed to be at a theme park today, and at that moment, we weren't.

When I walked down the hall to get my shoes on, Marcus nearly knocked me over rushing to the front door. “Joy’s Jubilee: Where a kid like me, can be totally free!” He sang, like he’s heard in the jingle countless times.

“Ah, that reminds me, honey- we have headache medicine in the car, yeah?” My mom asked as she turned to dad. He simply nodded, pouring the pot of coffee into two separate containers.

“Here, you’ll need this too.” He laughed, handing her the container. With one last check around the house, we piled into the van, and hit the road, ready for a two hour journey. We spent most of the time listening to Marcus excitedly planning what he wants to do first, and listening to him loudly watch video’s starring Joy the Juniper Tree. I found myself staring out the window as the countryside rolled by. While I found Joy’s Jubilee fun, I’d always get a small pit in my stomach whenever we went. Dad assured me that we picked a good time of the year, and that there was nothing to worry about, but as I watched the clouds roll by, I couldn’t shake my tiny feeling of unease. I tried to think about all the people that’d be there that day, in hopes that it’d help. Before I knew it, however, we passed by a sign with a cartoon tree on it, with the words “Howdy, folks! This way to Joy’s Jubilee!” plastered in colorful writing.

“It’s Joy!” Marcus squealed, as if it’s the first time he’d seen it. We managed to slowly drift in a sea of parked cars, before we found a spot. The four of us wobbled out of the car, stretching our legs, before we were hit with a spray of white mist.

“Dad! Warn me next time, geez! I almost had my mouth open.” I coughed and sputtered. The smell of bananas and coconut overpowered my nose, as dad shook the spray-can of sunscreen, before hitting us with another dose, like an exterminator to a persistent roach.

“Can’t be too careful, boys! Close your eyes!” He said over the hiss of the can, before he turned to my mother. She eyed him coldly.

She only uttered, “No.” Before snatching the can away from him, and spraying herself down.

With the whole family properly coated, we began the trek to the front gates of Joy’s Jubilee. The large coasters, and other various attractions crested over the treeline as we were faced with the large, colorful sign of Joy and her seedlings, at the entrance of Joy’s Jubilee. Marcus could barely stop moving, jumping in place excitedly as Dad paid for the tickets. Dad had us all sign the waiver, before handing it back to the ticket person. The person handing my dad the tickets smiled, with their awkward, wooden smile. “It’s a Joy to have you here!” They chirped with a rehearsed cadence.

With a swing of the turnstile, we were past the front gates, into the main part of the park, Joy’s Junction, filled with food stalls of all kinds, and plenty of overpriced merchandise, all to the theme of a fairy grove. “Park Map? Buttons? Balloons?” The seedlings were every few feet or so, each with a chipper grin, and the same, clear cadence. The older I got, the more unnerving I found the seedlings to be. They were so lifelike, from a distance. The closer you got, however, the more their skin looked like bark, and their eyes seemed too glossy. “How about a shirt, commemorating our newest seedling, Glenda?” One held up a shirt, a cartoonish seedling girl’s face in the middle of the shirt, with the words “Glenda” in a cutesy font underneath, and the Joy’s Jubilee logo next to it.

Marcus had no time for the seedlings, however, as he rushed past them to the center of Joy’s Junction, where there she stood herself- Joy the Juniper. A gigantic, towering tree,a crown of branches with berries, she stood in the middle of the plaza, fenced off on all sides. Her eyes were currently closed. A small wave of calm ran through my shoulders.

“HIIIIIII JOOOOOY!” Marcus called out to the tree, and waved. Dad came up to him, and placed his hand on Marcus’ shoulder. “Marcus, don’t tell me you asked to come here for your birthday, just to say hi to a tree, hmm? I bet the line to Forest Flyers is pretty low, if we hurry.” Marcus spun around excitedly, giggling, and started running in the direction he knew the coaster was in. “Hurry, hurry!” He called to us over his shoulder.

From Forest Flyers, we hit Spinning Sunflowers next, followed by The Boar, one of the newer, high speed roller coasters. Dad insisted we hit the Atrium of Legendary Botanists next, despite the fact that he always slept through the show. By now, we were getting pretty hungry, and so we sat down for a bite to eat over at Oakey-Dokey. Even as the seedlings catered to us, bringing the food over in a quick and expert manner, I was enjoying myself thoroughly. I did notice my berry smoothie tasting a bit off, which was weird, as it was usually my favorite thing to get. Beyond that, the worries of the day seemed so far away in that moment. It was when I heard Joy’s voice over the speakers, that my gut did a flip.

“Howdy ya’ll! This is your good friend Joy speaking! In just 30 minutes, we’re going to have a special seedling ceremony! Now ain’t ya’ll just lucky?” It was clearly a recording, but it didn’t make me feel any better. “Not sure where to go? Don’t worry, my pals, the seedlings, should be able to git you back on over to Joy’s Junction lickety quick! Remember folks, attendance is mandatory- Not like you’d want to miss it anyway! Later, ya’ll!”

The crowd of people around us at the Oakey-Dokey started murmuring to themselves, some getting up right away to secure good seats to the ceremony. I looked over to my Mom and Dad, who snuck a concerned look to each other, before putting a smile on for me and my brother. “Wow, what are the chances?” My mother started, beaming at us.

Marcus hopped up. “Oh boy! A seedling ceremony?! I haven’t seen one in like, forever!” He cheered. It’s true, we hadn’t seen a seedling ceremony over the last four or five times we’ve been, though it doesn’t make the process any easier. We quickly finished our meal, as the seedlings corralled us all back to the plaza near the front of the park, where rows of seats were lined up. We were ushered into a row towards the middle, as more and more guests were packed in. The crowd bustled with an excited, nervous energy.

When no more people seemed to be seated, a rustling, creaking noise had murmured the whole crowd. All eyes looked forward, as the Juniper tree groaned, and shook. Two large, oaken eyelids split open, revealing the dark, amber eyes underneath. More crackling of bark shook the air around us, as the tree opened it’s woody, maw. “Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa.” A booming, ancient voice echoed amongst the crowd. Overhead, the cutesy voice of Joy from the cartoons called out over the loudspeakers. “For years, I, Joy, the spirit of whimsy, have made Joy’s Jubilee a place for all manner o’ folk to come and take a load off. Joy’s Jubilee is a place where kids can be free to be how they want to be, without the cares of the outside world. Don’t worry, adults, that goes for the kids in all of us.” This line garnered some polite chuckles from the crowd. The loudspeaker voice continued.

“Today, we got something special for you folks- a seedling ceremony! We’ll start by saying goodbye to our oldest seedling, our dear Agatha.” The crowd applauded, as a creaky, slower seedling made their way down the rows, past the opened gate, and up to Joy. On stage, near the other seedlings, there was a clear difference in Agatha’s appearance, the wood of their skin chipped and discolored, their posture more hunched, compared to the rest of cheery seedlings on stage.

“Agatha has provided over 100 years of fantastic service to our friends visiting us every day here at Joy’s Jubilee, and with that, we give a hearty, Joy filled ‘Thank you!’” The speaker voice exclaimed, as the crowd cheered and clapped at the seedling, who bowed with what little energy they had left.

“And now, join as all as we wave goodbye to Agatha, as she returns to where all seedlings start- back to my heart.” The speakers crackle out overhead, as the real Joy opens her mouth wide, the wood splintering to reveal a dark, pitch black chasm. With one last wave goodbye to the crowd, the withered seedling took measured steps, entering inside the shadowy maw, before Joy clamped down, with no trace of the seedling remaining. There was a moment of creaking, and silence, before the speakers started back up.

“Well now, folks, if there’s one thing ol’ Joy knows, is that nature is a cycle- to every end, there is a neeeeewwww beginning!” The crowd cheered with a nervous energy, some people fidgeting in their seats. My heart caught in my throat.

“Now ya’ll, listen carefully. Can you hear me? Can you understand me?” The cartoon voice overhead giggled, as the tree in front of us, opened it’s mouth again. “Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa. Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa.” It repeated, with a deep rumbling and shuddering. With every repetition, I sighed in relief. I couldn’t understand what she was saying. What I heard next to me had my heart shatter.

“I’m right here, Joy!” Marcus laughed playfully. “I’m right here!” He attempted to get out of his seat, and I tried to stop him. “Marcus, no, stop. Don’t move.” I whispered, trying not to call attention to the seedlings who were walking up and down the rows. Marcus looked up at me and frowned, folding his arms. Our parents quickly realized what was happening, and looked on in horror.

“How come? Jeremy, Joy is looking for me!” He whined loudly, wiggling further out of his seat, despite my attempts to push him to sit back down. By now, a few seedlings started walking into our row, seeing the commotion. They take one look at Marcus, and they all nodded. By now, mom’s inconsolable, as dad stood to try to reason with the incoming seedlings. “Now listen here, maybe he’s just making it up-” He tried to rationalize, but the seedlings brushed past him easily, with a strength that betrayed their smaller, childlike shapes. One of the seedlings held Marcus by his hand.

I stood up, ready to swing at the seedling who had my brother, and I threw my fist, my nerves fried, my brain going in a million directions. The seedling didn’t react to the impact, and two more rushed over to me, and hold me down in the seat. “Marcus! No! Please!” I screamed, as Marcus waddled down the aisle, hand in hand with the seedling. The seedling took Marcus to the front of the tree. The crowd cheered as the little boy, my brother, stood before the stretching Juniper, with some of the crowd whispered to each other, some hugged their own children tightly in relief. Marcus waved to the crowd, before the loud, groaning voice of the tree rumbled again. “Korunnnn Goruvta…..”

I saw Marcus say something to the tree, which I can guess were the words “My name is Marcus.” The tree stood motionless for a moment, and as much as I struggled and screamed, I couldn't break free of the seedlings who held me, as Joy’s mouth creaked open once again, widely, enough to accommodate a person. Marcus hesitated, before he stepped inside. When Joy’s mouth closed, I felt my whole body go numb, and limp in shock. I could barely register the overhead speaker talking once more.

“Everyone, please join me in a Joyful welcome as we meet Marcus, our newest seedling!” The crowd erupted in cheers, as numerous amounts of berries grew in a rapid frenzy on Joy’s branches, before falling to the floor, for the seedlings to collect for various recipes around the park. Joy’s mouth creaked open, and out stepped a seedling, identical in size, clothing, and hair as the rest of the seedlings. It’s his face that caused me to shudder, sobbing silently, and have my mother’s wails carry through the crowd. It was Marcus’ face.

Marcus waved to the crowd, before joining the other seedlings in a joyous hug. Without even glancing our way, he ran off to who knows where with a group of them. A jingle played overhead, before Joy closed her eyes, signifying the end of the celebration. One final time, the chipper speaker voice comes to life, with accompanying cheesy music. “Thank you all for joining us in our special Seedling ceremony. I hope ya’ll will join us again real soon!” I turned to face my parents, speechless, as the crowds dispersed. I noticed a good chunk of the crowd heading to the closest shirt stall crowding to buy something. One member of the crowd turned to reveal their latest purchase. A shirt, with a caricature of my brother’s face in the middle of the shirt, with the words “Marcus” in a cutesy font underneath, and the Joy’s Jubilee logo next to it.",3,1750645954.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

But without sounding out of touch, i don’t believe it’s total nonsense.

Going out for something to eat or drink now is incredibly expensive. And obviously that’s not the consumers fault, but all still choose to go and do it. 

Every time we go out for breakfast, which is rare now, there is always a massive wait. Every other building on our Main Street is a coffee / cafe place. And they’re all full. You’re easily looking at at least $30 per person .

At work, every day half the office wanders down to the local cafe for a coffee, and sometimes before too.

Not saying the property market for FTBs isnt completely screwed, but I think the whole ‘you could buy a house if you stopped eating avocado on toast’ meme has been done to death, and there it is 100% true that constantly spending money on treats is going to delay your deposit massively.

People rarely stop to think about the small, mundane things they do—like lifting a kettle to make a coffee or pulling a toaster out of a cupboard. But when you live in chronic pain, these simple tasks become obstacles. Each one chips away at you. They take from your daily supply of energy—your ""spoons""—and can leave you exhausted before the day has even begun.

It becomes a mental game: How much can I endure today before my mind refuses to let me move? Like trying to put your hand on a flame, your body pulls back. Not out of weakness, but because pain changes the rules.

It’s like this: every time you want to do something—make a coffee, take your child out, make love, cook dinner—you have to hit your hand with a rubber mallet. And people who don’t live with it will say, “I could do that for a few days.” But that’s the part they can’t grasp.

Doing it for a day or a week is survivable. But imagine being told you can never stop. You can’t put the mallet down. It's now part of your life. Forever.

That mallet starts to bruise you. Even the lightest hit—just making a coffee—slowly wears down your mental strength. And eventually, you can’t even think of doing something without feeling broken. So, you ask for help. You go through the motions. You endure months, sometimes years, of advocacy and waiting. And eventually, if you're lucky, you get pain meds that help. They don’t fix it. But now, when you wake up, you put on a glove… and pick up the hammer again.

You do what you must. Because people need you. You need to pick your child up from school. You need to work. You need to live. So you keep going. Even as the glove wears out—your tolerance fading—you keep hitting. Because life doesn’t pause for pain.

The cruel irony? People only see you when you're strong. When you’ve masked the pain so well, they don’t believe it exists. They don’t see the broken parts. The days you cry in the shower, waiting for the glove to loosen enough to fit over your bruised hand. The days you don't think you can summon the strength to keep going. The days you've already broken and rebuilt yourself a hundred times, just to have a shot at a ""normal"" life.

But it’s not a full life. It’s a compromised one—governed by what the gloved hand allows. Never on your terms. Never with ease.

That’s what it’s like. Every day.

I checked in, and the first thing the volunteer asked: “Drop bag or crew?”
“Crew,” I said, glancing around for familiar faces.

To my left, volunteers huddled around a fire pit, their laughter dancing with the flames. To my right, runners slumped in camp chairs, blank stares and steaming broth in hand. I turned behind me… nothing. Just trail and darkness.

Ping.
A text. From my crew chief.
“Good morning.”
I blinked. “Yo. Are you guys at Brockway?”

The response came fast — they were parking now. Then the question:
“Your tracker said 9.5, right?”

Relief washed over me. I’d only been there a few minutes, and they were close. I texted back that I was grabbing food and finding a chair. I wrapped myself in a spare blanket and let my eyes shut — a power nap while I waited.

Fifteen minutes passed. I stirred, looked around. No new faces. I closed my eyes again.

Ten more. Still no sign.

Then fifteen again — and finally, a headlamp. But it wasn’t coming from the road. It was approaching from the trail. Odd.

Whoever it was, they were carrying something… a folded chair?

It was Gary, my crew captain — hiking the singletrack trail into the aid station… carrying a zero-gravity chair like it was a weapon of war. Moments later, my wife appeared beside me, eyes wide with adrenaline. Something had clearly gone wrong. This was not the normal aid station vibe.

“Can you come sit over by the chair your father-in-law’s setting up?”
I glanced at the one I was already in. “But I’m already sitting in a chair?”

She gave me the look. So I shuffled over in my blanket burrito and plopped down in the freshly planted throne.

“Did you bring the cortado?” I asked hopefully.

Blank stares.

Coffee was a no-go. Okay, no worries. “How about my miso soup?”

Gary dropped to a knee, reached into his pocket like he was about to propose… and pulled out a Snickers.
“Hey bro… you want this?”

I didn’t. Not even a little bit. But I realized something in that moment: my crew needed me more than I needed them. They had bushwhacked a mile of singletrack at 3 AM with gear on their backs just to get to me. I smiled. Took the Snickers. (It never left the aid station.)

I stood up, mentally bracing myself to reenter the dark. I was already geared up, still feeling strong, and knew Tahoe City lay ahead. I didn’t linger. The night was still mine.

I hugged my crew, thanked them for the madness, and climbed the steep connector back to the TRT — 20 miles to go before the sun would rise again.

Part 5 coming soon.

We were all chatting when i saw this girl and i thought she was really pretty, they urged me to go talk to her. I felt she was way out of league but i did it anyway. We ended up talking for awhile i got her number and IG. I texted her at the end of the night to see if she’d like to get coffee sometime. During the convo she seemed into me and into the fact of going to a cafe. She texted me at around 1pm saying that she’d love to get coffee. She asked for my availability this week and i texted her back it. Since then though it’s been radio silence. I don’t know if that means she’s not interested or if she’s busy. I know people have lives, but it’s kind of hurting my feelings. Am i overthinking jt to much? It does feel like she may not be that interested or i’m just not used to reading cues. A part of me is like “well you met her at the bar” so i shouldn’t feel like there could be anything to come out of this. But it would be nice :(

1li52t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1li52t8/hello_excited_to_get_back_to_cold_brewing_am_i/,Hello! Excited to get back to cold brewing. Am I doing this right?,"So I worked next to the Brooklyn Roasting Company and have fallen in love with their cold brew. My neighborhood coffee shop does not make good cold brew and I'm switching jobs where I need to be basically on the train by the time it opens anyway. So rather than start a new job with a caffeine deficiency, I figured I'd try my hand at cold brew. I used to do this about 6 or 7 years ago when I was desperate and it came out ok, but even after all these years I distinctly remember the taste of grinds in my drink, getting to the point of greek coffee. Back then, I used individual glass bottles with their own filters and remember thinking I would just get a mason jar if I ever did it again. Well. Here we are.

  
So I started by researching *the best* cold brew kit Amazon could supply. I went as far as ordering one before I went down the rabbit hole of this sub. I cancelled it and bought a coffee sock (I legit thought someone was joking when I first read it).

  
Instead, I bought the sock (two actually), two 64 oz mason jars, a 24oz thermos and a food scale. Then I bought Brooklyn Roasting Company cold brew blend, coarse ground. They suggest one bag to one gallon of water. 

My plan is to set up one jar a week on a rotating basis. I'm assuming I'll have to update my formula a little as I go, but that's half a bag per jar per my math (although maybe it'll come out a little stronger -- do you account for the space the coffee & sock take up in the math?), I will warm brew it for \~16 hours (maybe 24 hours since that's their recommendation) and then my plan is to pour it into a second sock (overkill?) in a new mason jar where I will then store it in the fridge and indulge over ice with a little bit of oat milk. 

  
Given the math, I think I'll come out ahead. It's \~$6 for the cold brew at a coffee shop. If I do it myself, 5lbs was $70 all in, so $14 for a lbs, which is 128 ounces, assuming a few ounces for ice and oat milk, that's $2 a day. Just an added bonus, my main goal is to replicate the coffee I've been buying for 5+ years.

So a few quick questions:

Should I do 40% or 33%? for the inaugural mix? 1/3 of the bag would be 120g of coffee for 64oz container. I like the coffee strong since I only drink one a day, but I'm not looking to overdose either. The stronger side of what a coffee shop would serve is what I'm aiming for. 

I know there are diminishing returns on going after a certain brew time, but I'm probably going to set it up before bed one night and then transfer it before bed the next night, so 24hours of brew. Is there any downside to that? This will be at room temp. 

Is having a second coffee sock filter overkill? 

Anything I'm missing?

  
Depending on how confident I get, I might toss up some pictures once I get myself established. Thanks!",4,1750644873.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False

1li51ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearUpGaming/comments/1li51ft/why_the_amd_ryzen_7_7800x3d_is_still_the_gaming/,Why the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is Still the Gaming King (And Intel Hates This One Trick),"Hey there, fellow PC enthusiasts! :) Let me guess – you're probably here because you're either building a new gaming rig or wondering if the 7800X3D hype is actually real. Well, grab a coffee because we're about to dive deep into why this little 8-core monster has been absolutely demolishing everything Intel throws at it.

I've been testing CPUs for years now, and honestly? The **AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D** might just be the most impressive gaming processor I've ever used. But here's the thing – it's not just about raw specs or fancy marketing terms. This chip does something special that makes your games run smoother than butter on a hot pan.

# What Makes the 7800X3D Actually Special?

Let's cut through the marketing BS for a second. The **Ryzen 7 7800X3D** isn't just another CPU with bigger numbers. It's packing AMD's **3D V-Cache technology**, which is basically like giving your processor a photographic memory for gaming data.

Here's what you're getting:

* **8 cores, 16 threads** (perfect sweet spot for gaming)
* **4.2 GHz base clock, 5.0 GHz boost** (fast enough to make you smile)
* **96MB of L3 cache** (this is where the magic happens)
* **120W TDP** (won't turn your room into a sauna)

That massive 96MB cache? That's triple what most CPUs have. Think of it like having a bigger desk when you're working – everything you need is right there within arm's reach instead of having to dig through filing cabinets.

# Gaming Performance That Actually Matters

Now, let's talk real-world performance because that's what actually matters when you're trying to hit those sweet 144fps+ targets. IMO, this is where the **7800X3D** absolutely shines.

# 1080p Gaming Dominance

At 1080p, this chip is an absolute beast. We're talking about **11% better performance** on average compared to Intel's Core i7-13700K. In some games like Resident Evil 4, you're looking at a staggering **26% advantage**. That's not margin of error – that's ""holy crap, why is this so much faster?"" territory.

# 1440p Still Impressive

Moving up to 1440p, the 7800X3D still flexes hard. Sure, your GPU starts becoming more of the bottleneck here, but you're still getting noticeably smoother framerates and better 1% lows (which is what actually makes games feel smooth).

# 4K Gaming

At 4K? Well, your graphics card is doing most of the heavy lifting here, but the 7800X3D still provides excellent frame pacing and eliminates those annoying stutters that can ruin your gaming experience.

# Intel vs AMD: The Reality Check

Here's where things get spicy. Intel fanboys aren't gonna love this, but the numbers don't lie. When you stack the **7800X3D** against Intel's best gaming offerings:

**vs Intel Core i7-13700K:**

* AMD wins in gaming by \~11% on average
* Intel has more cores (16 vs 8) but games don't care
* AMD runs cooler and uses less power
* AMD costs less (yeah, seriously)

**vs Intel Core i7-14700K:**

* Similar story, AMD still dominates in games
* Intel better for productivity workloads
* AMD better price-to-performance for gamers

The harsh reality? **If you're building a gaming-focused PC, Intel's extra cores are basically useless.** Games care more about that massive cache and efficient architecture than having 20+ threads sitting around doing nothing.

[Get the best gaming CPU for your build](https://amzn.to/3FPO2qV)

# 3D V-Cache: The Secret Sauce

Ever wondered why this works so well? It's all about that **3D V-Cache technology**. Traditional CPUs constantly have to fetch data from your RAM, which is like asking someone to run to the store every time you need something.

The 7800X3D's massive cache is like having a fully stocked pantry – everything games need is right there, instantly accessible. This means:

* **Reduced latency** (games respond faster)
* **Higher frame rates** (more FPS for you)
* **Better frame pacing** (smoother experience)
* **Improved 1% lows** (no more stutters)

# Real-World Gaming Experience

Let me get personal for a second. I upgraded from a perfectly good i7-12700K to the 7800X3D, and the difference was immediately noticeable. Not just in synthetic benchmarks, but in actual gameplay:

**Cyberpunk 2077:** Went from occasional stutters to buttery smooth gameplay **CS2:** Consistent 300+ FPS instead of dropping to 200s during intense moments  
**Baldur's Gate 3:** Loading times cut in half, no more hitches during combat

FYI – these aren't placebo effects. The extra cache genuinely makes games run better, especially modern titles that love to stream assets constantly.

# Power Efficiency That Doesn't Suck

Here's something Intel doesn't want you to know: the 7800X3D is incredibly efficient. While Intel's chips are chugging power like a V8 engine, AMD's solution sips electricity like a Prius.

**Gaming power consumption:**

* 7800X3D: 30-60W typically
* Intel equivalents: 80-120W+

Your electricity bill will thank you, and so will your cooling solution.

# The Few Downsides (Because Nothing's Perfect)

Look, I'm not gonna blow smoke up your ass – the 7800X3D isn't perfect:

# Productivity Performance

If you're doing serious video editing, 3D rendering, or compilation work, Intel's higher core count chips will beat it. The 7800X3D is a gaming specialist, not a productivity monster.

# Overclocking Limitations

You can't really overclock this chip much due to the 3D V-Cache. AMD locked it down to prevent thermal issues. But honestly? It's already fast enough that you won't miss it.

# Price Premium

It costs more than a basic 8-core CPU, but considering the gaming performance gains, it's actually great value for money.

# Should You Buy It in 2024?

Short answer: **Hell yes**, if gaming is your primary use case.

Long answer: The 7800X3D is still the undisputed gaming champion, even with newer chips launching. Sure, the 9800X3D exists now and is technically faster, but it's also more expensive and harder to find.

**Buy the 7800X3D if:**

* Gaming is your #1 priority
* You want the best bang for your buck
* You care about power efficiency
* You're tired of Intel's heat and power consumption

**Skip it if:**

* You do heavy productivity work
* You're on a tight budget
* You already have a decent gaming CPU

# Final Thoughts: The Gaming Reality

The **AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D** isn't just another CPU – it's a paradigm shift. It proves that smart engineering (3D V-Cache) beats brute force (more cores) when it comes to gaming performance.

Is it the absolute fastest CPU in every scenario? Nope. Is it the best gaming CPU for most people? Absolutely.

Intel's been playing catch-up ever since this chip launched, and frankly, they're still behind. The 7800X3D delivers where it matters most: making your games run better, smoother, and more consistently than anything else in its price range.

Want my honest recommendation? If you're building a gaming PC in 2024 and want the best possible experience without going completely overboard on budget, this is your chip. Just don't blame me when you start hitting frame rates you never thought were possible ;)

**Ready to upgrade your gaming experience?** The 7800X3D is still readily available and continues to dominate gaming benchmarks. Your graphics card will finally have a CPU that won't hold it back.",1,1750644753.0,GearUpGaming,0,1.0,False

[Update at 1710 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1iznnw8/1710_hours_of_th_study_98_comprehensible_input/)

For contrast to my comprehensible input method, you can read these reports from learners who are using traditional methods for Thai:

[2200-2500 hours of traditional methods for Thai](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnthai/comments/1ia5khc/review_of_last_250_hours_of_thai_study/)  
[Far over 3000 hours of traditional methods for Thai](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnthai/comments/1hwele1/language_lessons_from_a_lifelong_learner/) 

One takeaway I took from these other reports is that learning Thai takes a *very* long time, regardless of methods. I feel quite happy with my results so far and don’t feel I’m behind in any way.

###Prerequisite Disclaimer

This is a report of my personal experience using comprehensible input. This is not an attack on you if you enjoy explicit grammar study, flashcards, vocabulary, learning podcasts, Duolingo, etc. I am not going to break into your house and burn your textbooks.

I'm just sharing my experience with a learning style that I'm enjoying and that I've been able to stick with. I'm excited to talk about something that's working for me, personally, and hoping that my post can give insight to other learners interested in comprehensible input / [automatic language growth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgdZTyVWfUhlcP3Wj__xgqWpLHV0bL_JA) as a learning method.

I think everyone has different learning styles, and while we may be on different journeys, we're all aiming for similar destinations as far as being able to use and live with our TLs. Language learners are as diverse and unique as the languages and cultures we're studying, and I'm happy to celebrate our diversity in learning styles.

I hope we all achieve our goals, even if we're on different paths!

###TL;DR of earlier updates:

American splitting time between Bangkok and the US. Mostly monolingual previously (studied Japanese for a couple years), started to seriously look at learning Thai in December 2022.

I'm using a *pure* comprehensible input approach. No grammar, no books, no flashcards, no Thai-to-English translations, no dictionary lookup, etc. I delayed speaking, reading and writing until many hundreds of hours later (after I started to develop a good ""ear"" and intuition for Thai).

All I did for the first ~1000 hours was watch comprehensible input by Thai teachers. Everything is 100% in Thai, initially supplemented with drawings, gestures, and pictures to aid understanding.

I started speaking a little after ~1200 hours, but started speaking more after around 1700 hours. I currently have ~70 hours of speaking practice and ~2000 hours of listening practice. The remaining hours are reading practice.

###Learning Summary of Past 3 Months

I’ve been consistently putting in 25-30 hours a week for the past 3 months. I had a one week break where I went to Taiwan for rock climbing. I barely did any Thai study during this time, though at one point I did binge season 1 of Weak Hero in Thai dub and I also had a two hour dinner with a Thai friend studying Mandarin in Taipei.

I was also sick for one week and my Thai practice dropped down to maybe 15-20 hours, but I still put in regular time.

###Current Learning Routine

Each week, I’m doing roughly:

10 hours of private lessons, where I watch native content with my teachers and they explain words/phrases I don’t understand (my questions and teacher explanations 100% in Thai)
5 hours of calls with a Thai friend, where we do the same thing as (1). He kindly offered to do this for free.
10 hours of native content (mostly YouTube and Netflix, sometimes Disney+)
~5 hours of conversation with Thai people where I speak 99% Thai. Occasionally will use English for something I absolutely can’t figure out how to get across otherwise.

I track my learning separately across input, crosstalk, shadowing, 100% Thai conversation, and reading/writing. 95% of my total study so far has been input. I call my lessons “input”, though I am speaking Thai during these lessons - but I’m mostly listening to the content and teachers, so it’s more on the input side.

Increasingly I find these categories kind of meaningless as more and more of my life just switches over to Thai. Even my “reading” practice I’m also swapping between audio tracks (which I understand better) as I read. I roughly guess the time I spend talking with Thai friends over coffee, at the gym, etc but it’s hard to measure precisely.

My YouTube algorithm recommendations are now 95% Thai. I do not watch English videos, movies, or TV unless I can find a Thai dub for it.

My study is 100% time engaged with native Thai. Native content, breaking down native content with teachers (both myself and the teachers speaking Thai), speaking with natives, shadowing native content, practicing reading using Thai subtitles as I listen to Thai audio, etc.

###Comprehension

So using the Dreaming Spanish Roadmap as a guide, I am currently at the start of Level 6. This is after increasing the hours required for each level by x2, which is the recommendation when learning a tonal language as an English speaker.

Excerpt from Level 6:

> You can understand TV shows about daily life quite well (80 to 90%). Shows about families, friends, etc. Unscripted shows will usually also be easier to understand than scripted shows, as long as they are not too chaotic or rely too much on cultural knowledge.

I don’t feel at this level yet. I would say my understanding is more like 60 to 70% for the kind of content described. 

I have higher understanding for dubbed content. I can watch Disney movies, romance anime, and sports anime. Comprehension varies from 70 to 80%. Some scenes I understand 100%, then some scenes I’ll understand 50%. 

In the real world, when I spend time with my Thai friends, I have no trouble understanding Thai people speaking to me directly as long as the environment is not too challenging. By that I mean, the surroundings are not too loud or chaotic and I can hear the other person’s voice clearly.

I can usually understand two of my Thai friends speaking directly to each other. My comprehension drops significantly with three Thai people talking and further as more native Thais join the conversation.

I’m currently enjoying the following YouTube channels:

[Buffalo Gags](https://www.youtube.com/@buffalogags2010): Thai comedy channel. I mainly watch Buff Talk, which is a parody interview format, similar in concept to “Between Two Ferns”.  
[YuenDeaw](https://www.youtube.com/@YuenDeaw): Thai standup comedy channel.  
[Muse Thai Dub](https://www.youtube.com/@musethaidub772): Thai dubs of Japanese anime series. Content region locked to Thailand.

Comprehension varies (a *lot*) but things I’ve watched recently and enjoyed (either native Thai or Thai dub):

* Blue Box, a Japanese sports/romance anime  
* Weak Hero, a Korean drama series  
* A ton of Thai standup comedy ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kHut9YcS3w))

I am super enjoying Thai standup comedy lately. It’s often quite hard, but certain comedians are very understandable to me now. I recently did two things related to Thai standup comedy.

First, I went to watch a standup comedian perform live at a small venue in Bangkok. This was an absolute blast. I understood about 80% of the live routine, which was a huge surprise - I was expecting to understand far less. The crowd was maybe 20-30 people, which shows that the standup comedy community in Thailand is really small but intimate. Everyone seemed to know each other.

People were incredibly friendly. I went with a couple other foreign friends who know Thai. We all had a great time, everyone was so welcoming, and we’re planning to go again in the near future.

Second, I traveled to Korat to watch Buff Talk on Stage. This is a live version similar to the [one they had in Bangkok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz7WhfDfppw) some months ago. I met up with a friend in Korat, we went to the show together, and the next day we toured the university where she works.

I understood about 80% of the stage performance, except for the first 20 minutes. There was an opening act from a local comedian. I understood VERY little, maybe 10-20%. Afterward, my friend told me he was speaking Isaan, or northeastern dialect, which is only about 70% the same as Bangkok/central dialect.

I was afraid I wouldn’t understand anything the whole show, but the main stage event was in central dialect, which was perfectly fine.

I will say that after two days in Korat spending my time nearly 100% in Thai, my brain felt pretty fried at the end.

###Output

In short, I’m very happy with how much I’ve progressed in the last few months, but I definitely have a long way to go before I would consider myself fluent. I would consider myself somewhere around “low conversational” right now. I think this is quite good for ~70 hours of speaking practice.

My accent is clear and I think my prosody/rhythm is good. I absolutely make a ton of pronunciation mistakes. But I can clearly hear these mistakes, so I hope that this will make them easier to fix as I get used to speaking. I would assess myself as speaking about 70% correct, which shows that it is not necessary to be 100% on-target to be clearly understandable by Thai people… but also that most foreigners are more like 30% on-target.

When it comes to communicating with Thai people, my accent is almost never the problem - the issue is almost always lack of active vocabulary or uncertainty about how to naturally phrase something.

The vast majority of traditional learners I meet have the opposite problem - relatively large active vocabularies from memorization/reading but trouble being understood by natives due to accent.

I am quite content to have a problem with active vocabulary (which I know will naturally grow with exposure and practice).

Quoting from the Dreaming Spanish roadmap for level 6:

> You are conversationally fluent for daily purposes of living in the country and you can get by at the bank, at the hospital, at the post office, or looking for an apartment to rent.

This is not quite true. While there are many daily errands I can handle, there are still some I can’t. For example, I was not able to handle was trying to extend my cell phone contract in Thai. I was missing many words from my active vocabulary, so I had to do this in English.

I was able to handle going to the pharmacy, explaining my symptoms, and getting medicine. This was a little awkward because I couldn’t remember the word for “runny nose”, but I described it as “water in my nose” which was understood. 

I actually did look at a condo to rent in Thai. I met up with the agent and greeted her in Thai. Her response was essentially “oh good, you speak Thai” and then we handled the rest of the 15 minute viewing in Thai.

I understood everything and was able to communicate all my questions/thoughts. The one exception was she asked me in Thai if my move-in schedule was “flexible”; I did not understand this word, so she had to explain just this question in English.

> In spite of that odd word that is not quite there when you need it, you can always manage to get your point across in one way or another, and by now you are already making complex longer phrases.

This feels mostly true. I can get my point across in about 95% of situations I encounter. My phrasing is sometimes awkward or unnatural, and I often have to talk around words and phrases that are not yet in my active arsenal.

> Using humor in the language is much easier now. 

I think this is actually the place where my output shines the most in comparison to other learners. I am very comfortable joking around in Thai. I can be sarcastic and playful in Thai and I’m becoming increasingly adept at wordplay and puns. My jokes don't land 100% of the time, but I think my hit rate is pretty good.

I especially like มุขไม่ฮาพาเพื่อนเครียด - essentially, dad jokes meant to annoy friends.

I am really proud and happy with my progress here, which I credit to spending *so* much time listening to Thai comedians. I listen to this type of content more than I listen to anything else.

###Challenges

I feel like my listening is not improving as fast as I’d like. I know it’s better, but it’s very hard to feel the progress. I am now at the point where Dreaming Spanish recommends reading, and reading a lot.

I think this will help and it makes sense to me that this is the point where it’d be recommended. I think it’ll help a lot with getting more vocabulary, with getting a clearer idea of where to use different chunks and patterns, with making me more certain about the pronunciation of certain words that still feel blurry, etc.

I’ve found a method for reading practice that I really enjoy. On one screen, I put on an anime with Thai dub and subtitles. On the other screen, I put the manga version in Thai. The dub, subtitles, and manga translations are all slightly different.

So I can listen to the audio track and then read two slightly different variations carrying the same meaning.

I just started doing this, so we’ll see how effective it is over time. I am playing around with if I read first or listen first. Eventually I want to do passes where I read without the audio backing. I think this makes sense, as essentially it’s the opposite process that reading-heavy learners do to get used to listening.

###Final Thoughts

I’m happy with my progress so far. I wouldn’t change anything about how I’ve learned Thai. I know I’m not an amazing example of a Thai learner, like some of the established near-native speakers on YouTube.

I never aimed to be that, though - I’m just a guy who wants to be able to live his life in Thai and has found a learning method he really liked.

While I know I make many mistakes and may never live up to the expectations of critics of input learning, I also know that I’ve already reached a level of Thai proficiency that VERY few foreigners reach. I also know that all my language skills will continue to improve - listening, speaking, reading, writing.

And why wouldn’t my skills improve? That’s what happens to skills when you practice. For me, I feel language is less like studying math or science and more about cultivating skills. For me, it feels more like practicing a sport or a musical instrument.

I’ve met many, many foreign learners of Thai, though I've yet to meet any of the famous near-native influencer types. Of the learners I have actually met, the ones who I feel are significantly better than me share one of two factors:

1) They have been learning for more years than me and have significantly more practice.  
2) They started out with a much closer language already mastered, such as Mandarin or Vietnamese.

Otherwise, I don’t feel behind in any way with the traditional style learners I’ve met, including people who have attended classes at famous language schools here, people who have Thai partners, etc.

Anyway, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugP57VntAko) is a video of me speaking Thai with one of my teachers. This is a snapshot of where I am on my journey, but it is not the end of it.

If it is not to someone's expectations, that's a result of my lack of talent - it says nothing about my teachers, who are all absolutely amazing. As far as I'm concerned (and with all respect to others in this very challenging profession) there are no better Thai teachers in the world.

Thanks everyone for reading and good luck to you all on your respective journeys.",6,1750644609.0,learnthai,3,0.88,False

A few days ago, I finally had the courage to go up to him and make small talk. He seemed just as shy as me, it was so cute. So at the end of our conversation I asked him what his favourite baked good is and that's what I'd have for breakfast the next day. Well the next day he ended up buying me his favourite treats and smiled at me while telling me to have a good day. I thought I was going to faint.

Everybody is saying that's the surest sign yet that he's into me as he asked me to go for coffee a week earlier (which still hasn't happened yet). On 1 hand I'm too afraid of rejection and on the other hand I'm dying to know if he's interested in me. 

I started following him on Instagram this morning and sent him a DM saying him buying me my breakfast a couple days ago was the nicest thing anybody has done for me in a long time. Since following him, he's posted a story but hasn't followed me back or read my DM. I feel like I'm dying on the inside. It's likely I'll see him in the morning.

1li4wdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/christianblanco/comments/1li4wdw/world_hunger_games_4th_quinquennial_quell_25th/,World Hunger Games: 4th Quinquennial Quell (25th Hunger Games): Quell Terms + First Reaping,"The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Hunger Games was on everyone’s minds the second the 24th Hunger Games had concluded. The Capital’s favorite event of the year was on the horizon and everyone was scrambling to prepare themselves for this momentous occasion. The momentous occasion was the latest Quinquennial Quell, a game that implemented special rules to remind the districts of the Capital’s control after the disastrous Quelltastrophe of the 8th Hunger Games. Head Gamemaker Priscilla Cardew was preparing for her swan song with the long-awaited 4th Quinquennial Quell to blow the socks off the Capital. 

Hunger Games co-host Artemis Radcliffe invited Cardew as a guest on her morning show *Good Morning Panem.* Cardew dazzled viewers with her yellow sundress and enchanting stories about how life-changing the last few years had been. The biggest news she shared was that she and her husband, former Head Gamemaker Balthazar Grimstone, were expecting their first child together. Artemis squealed with excitement and promised to give her the best baby shower present ever. Artemis pressed Cardew on the baby’s gender and possible names but she refused to clarify. Cardew did disclose that the baby would be named after a past tribute from a game before her and her husband’s terms as game maker who she considered the rightful victor.

The 4th Quinquennial Quell came up and Artemis was curious about how much preparation was put into these special games. Cardew explained that she had prepared for this moment ever since she was enrolled in the game-making department before the 7th Hunger Games. Now that this was her final year, while she would retain her urban theme, she promised to do things completely differently for this year’s games. Artemis pressed for hints, hoping to “finally get something” as it was a special year. Cardew did not budge and teased her for not exercising patience like the rest of the Capital. Cardew was dismissed to begin preparations for the games. 

Artemis began her live commentary for the announcement of the terms for the 4th Quinquennial Quell. As the most important figures in the Capital flocked the Maximus Square, Artemis reiterated her hopes that this year would bring Panem another Golden Victor. Much of her commentary was focused on Phineas Ellingboe of District 6, the latest in the legendary lineup for astonishing “mystic” talents of keen observation and deduction along with his rise from the dead. Phineas’s life had changed drastically since his victory. He had reunited with his long lost biological uncle Herald Larsen, gone into business with Mortimer Beckett (victor of the 17th Hunger Games), and was currently pursuing his education in medicine while working under his mentor Phoebe Bentley (victor of the 3rd Hunger Games) at the Kento Rehabilitation Center. The biggest development of all was that Phineas had recently married Phoebe’s eldest daughter, arena baby Mirabelle Williams. The bride and groom were guests of honor for the quell announcement party as Phineas needed to prepare for the reaping tour. 

The time had come for the terms of the 4th Quinquennial Quell to be announced. President Walt welcomed everyone to Maximus Square and thanked the viewers for tuning in for this year’s televised event. He expressed his gratitude for being allowed to be Gideon Rain’s successor and leading Panem into a new age of the Hunger Games. He acknowledged the missteps he took on this journey, specifically the debacle involving the 23rd Hunger Games and Jansen Toliver’s release. He promised to be a better example for the people of Panem. President Walt was given the envelope by an Avox and the world leaned into the edge of their seats. 

Walt voiced his excitement for this year’s games and while having his fingers crossed for another Golden Victor, he determined that it was up to this year’s tributes. All of Panem held their breath and he ripped the envelope open. He read, “To remind the districts it was the most foolish among them who led them into battle, this year's tributes will be drawn from the bottom 5% of their district schools’ end-of-year examinations.” 

The Capital became intrigued at the idea of the “stupidest” tributes entering the arena. Some people felt relieved they were being given a break from intelligent victors and began speculating how the arena and its events would match the theme.

Phineas and his newlywed wife Mirabelle were carted off to the hoverjet for their first stop on the reaping tour. District 12 was experiencing a heat wave that year, seen in the beads of sweat that caked the faces of Mayor Kidman and victors Corpse Beckford and Laika Brown (victors of the 10th and 20th Hunger Games respectively). Phineas and Mirabelle personally welcomed the heat after the previous year’s harsh winter. Corpse gave his congratulations on the wedding while Laika passed around water. Laika joked about Phineas and Phoebe being the first in-law victors which received a few chuckles in response. Due to being in a good mood, Phineas obliged to a small reading before the tour began. He sympathized with Corpse’s plight of being forced to relocate back to the Capital after putting his career on hold to help run Laika’s orphanage. Corpse was depressed over the situation but was thankful to have Candace Freeman (victor of the 4th Hunger Games) nearby for support. 

During the tour, Laika was feeling distracted and provided little input, especially at the oil reserve she was currently working with to instate new safety regulations. Phineas pointed his cane at her and accurately guessed she was waiting for approval from the Capital for her safety specialist license. Mirabelle teasingly urged him to stop prying but Laika laughed and said he wasn’t wrong. She was itching to hear back and was worried their strict guidelines would deny her the license. Mirabelle assured her that she was incredibly loved in the Capital and would promise its citizens would rally if they heard she was rejected. She cautioned her to put it out of her mind until the games were over. The rest of the tour was quick as they were running out of time before the reaping. 

A brief lunch of sandwiches and fruit was served. Mirabelle and Corpse discussed recent developments in Phoebe’s therapy career while Phineas talked to Laika about the quell terms. Laika knew they were in for a difficult time. Phineas assured her it would all be over in one week.

The reaping ceremony bells beckoned the teal clad youth to gather in the square outside the town hall. Due to the quell terms, the audience in the reaping square was significantly smaller than the previous years. Mayor Kidman reiterated the quell terms but half-heartedly assured everyone that despite the reasons behind their eligibility, they were all people who deserved life as much as everyone. 

Phineas hobbled his way onto the stage and reached the microphone, nearly knocking it over. He heard a child giggle and he turned towards him and whispered, “Stop playing with yourself.” Phineas performed his victor’s speech and highlighted the amazing developments in his life the past year. Because he had much to be thankful for, his speech was well received by the Capital and a few audience members. Phineas told everyone to keep their chin up, reminding them they won two quell events already. He turned to Mirabelle, who gave him a sheepish thumbs up before gesturing towards the reaping bowls. The two reaping bowls held much fewer names than the previous years, so Phineas had to reach all the way to the bottom. The slip of paper he chose read the name of sixteen-year-old Alyssa Davis.

Many whispers were heard in both reaping enclosures, hinting to the viewers that this girl was well known. Cameras quickly found a trio of peacekeepers in the back pushing the girl into view. “Of course it’s me. Who would’ve thought?” she annoyedly exclaimed. Alyssa was average height with shoulder length brown hair and blue eyes wearing a menacing sneer on her face. The feature that had the most people talking was the handcuffs and peacekeeper entourage. 

Commentator Artemis snatched the notes from Luther’s hand and was surprised by its contents. Alyssa was the younger child of a reserve worker and nurse and had an older brother. She was training to work in the gold mines on the outskirts of the district until a year and a half ago when she was arrested for assaulting a fellow classmate and injuring an intervening peacekeeper. She was due for release a few months ago but that was shot down after she was allegedly caught poisoning a fellow prisoner. Artemis questioned how she qualified for the reaping ballot if she wasn’t in school, but Luther pointed out how she was technically still enrolled in her school. Artemis assumed Alyssa’s parents were disappointed, possibly scared of her. 

Alyssa smirked when she was on the stage staring at Phineas’s outstretched hand. She shook his hand and snarkily said, “Just try reading my mind. It’s a madhouse up there.” Phineas rolled his eyes and gave the peacekeeper permission to nudge her to her spot on stage. Phineas pinched his nose and exhaled in annoyance before walking to the male reaping bowl. He grabbed the first paper he touched and read the name of fifteen-year-old Denton Shafer.

Cameras struggled to find the district’s new champion for a minute before the peacekeepers found a small sobbing boy in the front of the enclosure. Artemis commented how he almost looked twelve. Denton was several centimeters shorter than most of the boys, which added to the confusion. Denton had scruffy black hair, brown eyes, and was the middle child of three. His parents were both nurses and made just enough to support their three children. Artemis tried to take the notes again, desperate to know what made him eligible, but Luther wouldn’t let her. The reason behind Denton’s low exam scores was because the teachers reported him to be dyslexic, always having difficulty processing written words and numbers. Besides that, his record was spotless. 

Denton shook while being escorted to the stage. He froze in front of Phineas and shakily extended his hand. He told Phineas his eyes were pretty and the latter thanked him saying he reminded him of his “wee brotha from anotha motha.” Instead of the usual handshake, Phineas knelt down and wrapped his arms around the frightened child before gently patting him on the back saying, “It’s okay laddy. Fight your butt off.” Denton took his place on the stage and his face became void of emotion as Mayor Kidman congratulated this year’s tributes. The two were moved into the town hall for final visitations.

Alyssa was not visited by her family. They had all but disowned her following her imprisonment. The one visitor she did have baffled commentators as the figure was wearing a disposable face mask. Alyssa laughed and told the boy to reveal himself. This boy removed his mask with help from peacekeepers and was revealed to be Alyssa’s current prisoner boyfriend Pacifius Birmingham. Pacifius laughed at Alyssa’s puzzled reaction before he wryly asked if she truly poisoned inmate Carter Deems. Alyssa playfully hit Pacifius before claiming her innocence.  Pacifius eyed the peacekeeper in the room, who whispered, “Careful with your words boy. Remember your deal.” 

The audience in Maximus Square squealed in excitement with Artemis revealing that Pacifius was promised a clean record if he would get Alyssa to confess to the poisoning. Alyssa saw through the exchange and remained steadfast in her on and off statements of innocence until she was ready to be escorted to the hoverjet but not before promising to win. Pacifius was furious and cursed Alyssa as he was dragged back to prison.

Denton was visited by his parents and two siblings. Denton couldn’t stop crying and shaking over the situation and all his family could do was embrace him. Denton cursed whoever decided to make him born dyslexic while his older brother Duncan cursed the Capital for deciding the quell terms. Their mother shushed him and told Duncan to keep quiet. She turned back to Denton and tried to assure him that he had as much chance as anyone to win. His younger brother Declan brought up how their two victors won quells and that he was learning from the best. Denton felt slightly better but was still lamenting his situation. He admitted how if he won, he didn’t have to go to school anymore. “No more after school lessons.” His mother instructed him to listen to both his mentors and not be ashamed of his condition. Duncan joked, “Besides, not like you’d need to read in the arena.” Duncan was unsure what to say to that but knew his family meant the best for him. The group shared a final embrace before Denton was escorted to the hoverjet

The tributes of District 12 found themselves in the lounge of the hoverjet as it took off. Denton shrunk into a chair opposite the bar and tried to avoid eye contact with Alyssa. Alyssa walked into the room with a skip in her step. She turned and winked at Denton, who shuddered and pulled a book in front of his face. Alyssa proceeded to pour herself a coffee and sat herself down on the table. She caught Denton curiously peeking at her, particularly her drink. Alyssa said, “What? You take me for an alcoholic or something?” Denton shrugged and sheepishly said he heard prisoners drank a lot, pointing to the prison ID tattoo on her left wrist. Alyssa laughed and said the rumors about peacekeepers feeding prisoners alcohol to make them more lucid and compliant was true, which is why she chose a coffee as their district always had a low supply. Denton wondered where their mentors were, to which Alyssa guessed they were discussing mentoring strategies, especially since this was “the year of the stupid tributes”. Denton insisted he wasn’t stupid and that his disability was real. Alyssa smirked and responded, “If you had a nickel for every time you had to say that you’d probably buy your way out of the reaping.” Denton paused and said nothing further.

Suddenly, Laika Brown (victor of the 20th Hunger Games) burst through the door with the lunch tray apologizing for being late. Alyssa set her coffee down and had already begun making a plate. She asked where Corpse was and Laika explained that he spilled hot tea on himself, so he was changing clothes. Alyssa puffed her bottom lip and said, “And I was looking forward to a tea party.” Laika rolled her eyes and introduced herself to Denton. Denton smiled and shook her hand. Denton became surprised when Lakia asked him how his brother Duncan was. Alyssa laughed and joked “Are you his ex-girlfriend?” Lakia smiled before telling Alyssa to look at her. Laika pointed to her pregnant stomach and stated she was six months pregnant with twins. She scolded Alyssa for her disrespect and told her she would never betray her partner unlike her. Denton remained quiet while Alyssa looked presently at Lakia. Oddly, Alyssa began to laugh and recite the famous lines of Ismelda Faraday from the Panem Founder’s Day play. She walked around in circles, ignoring Laika’s demands to be quiet. 

Corpse made his way with the tea kettles and was confused by Alyssa’s behavior. He poured a small amount of tea on the floor in her path, causing her to slip. While Laika pulled her off the ground and scolded her, Corpse grabbed a bottle of *Concord Champagne*. After chugging half the bottle, Corpse locked the cabinet before Laika joked, “Don't pass out again like you did last year.” Corpse laughed before countering, “Be careful with that spitfire, you’re eight months pregnant.”  Lakia gave him the bird good naturedly while tying Alyssa to a vertical gurney and wheeling her out of the room. 

Corpse noticed the still frozen Denton and kindly introduced himself. The two sat together at the table and ate their lunch. Corpse commented how peaceful it was now that his partner was gone, and Denton sheepishly nodded in response. Corpse slowly gave him the pregames rundown and more tea to calm his nerves. Corpse asked Denton what he wanted to do if he won the games. Denton looked at him and shocked him by claiming to not want to win. 

Corpse softened and admitted he never heard that one before. The thirty-one-year-old signed for an avox to bring in a yoga mat and some essential oils. Once this task was done, Corpse spread the oils around, greatly confusing Denton. The boy asked if Corpse was his real name. Corpse smiled before telling his mentee, “My real name is Andrew, but only my wife calls me that.” Denton smiled and asked “Can I call you Andrew then?” Corpse was touched by the gesture and nodded. The two got down on the yoga mats and performed some soothing stretches.

Meanwhile, Laika wheeled Alyssa into the training room for some one-on-one time. Alyssa switched from play recitations to lyrical poetry. When she suddenly began quoting lyrics from a problematic rebellion call to arms, Laika slapped the girl across the face. Alyssa was stunned she would resort to violence and shut her mouth. Laika leaned in and warned her to not ruin her or her partner’s chances with her behavior similar to Dolly, the District 11 female of the 19th Hunger Games. Seeing her tone was scaring Alyssa, Laika took the girl’s hand and said, “Look, I love Martin and Savannah dearly and you wouldn’t believe how Dolly’s actions ruined the entire district for everyone. We can’t afford any rebellious activity lest what happened to them happens to us. I will mentor you but if you turn into another Dolly, I will not hesitate to personally talk to Cardew myself. Consider this you’re only warning.” Laika untied Alyssa from the gurney and ordered her to practice with a weapon. Alyssa selected an axe and began swinging wildly at the training dummies. 

Laika started some small talk with her student while she was training. Alyssa answered the questions courteously, even divulging some prison gossip. The sentencing came up and Laika questioned Alyssa about the prison poisoning. Alyssa tried to divert from the topic by claiming to have already been questioned numerous times. Laika pointed out that the Capital were not going to punish her further than the games themselves would do. Alyssa stopped her practice and admitted she planned on it but wasn’t the culprit. Due to the overwhelming evidence against her and Pacifius’s testimony, she didn’t see the point in defending herself and only acted psychotic to hope for an insanity plea. Laika understood and said how she would’ve been an interesting patient for Phoebe Bentley (victor of the 3rd Hunger Games). Alyssa asked “Is that the monster?” Laika hushed her own smirk before replying “No, she was called that for choosing sobriety.” 

The ladies returned to the lounge area and joined Corpse and Denton for training discussions. Laika informed the boys of Alyssa’s unbridled energy and planned to pass on her self defense lessons from Ashley Chen (victor of the 13th Hunger Games). Corpse was impressed by the initiative but emphasized the importance of survival skills. Denton questioned what he meant by survival skills and Corpse suggested they watch previous games. Denton wanted to choose the one with the least blood, but Alyssa pointed out that all of them had it. Corpse pulled out the tapes and held them out to the tributes. Denton greatly struggled with reading the titles, so Corpse instead pulled out a victor’s tally with pictures. While Denton carefully scanned the pictures, Alyssa wanted to see Laika’s games. Corpse looked to Laika for permission and the latter shrugged. 

The 3rd Quinquennial Quell captured the attention of both tributes. Alyssa was the only tribute to provide insights over tributes’ performances while Denton watched silently. When the masked killer Mitchell Broadbent aka the Prospector came on the screen, Alyssa’s face turned white. Laika noticed this and asked what was wrong. Alyssa pointed at the screen and said she knew the man. Upon hearing his name, Alyssa claimed he was her uncle. 

A shell-shocked Laika stepped away and tried to compose herself while Alyssa began making excuses. She claimed he was only her uncle through his younger sister, who married her father’s brother, thereby sharing no blood relation to the killer. Before she continued Alyssa took her arm out and showed a large gash across it. While Corpse and Denton stared at the old wound, Alyssa claimed “I may have no blood relation but rest assured that man was not sane or ok in any way. Look what he did.” Lakia refused to respond and scoffed before saying “Not a chance in hell I’m mentoring her, Andrew.” The two women stormed out of the room and retired for the night. 

Corpse and Denton spent the rest of the night watching the 9th, 10th, and 12th Hunger Games. Corpse asked if he understood the commentary and Denton said he had no issues outside of the subtitles and headlines. He claimed to have always had issues with reading and writing due to his dyslexia and learned best when watching and listening. Corpse guessed his first aid and mining classes were where he excelled and Denton confirmed this. Corpse assured him that he didn’t have to read anything and can learn new skills through hands-on practice. Denton was unsure and began to doubt his statement over not wanting to win. Corpse knelt down and said, “At least you have a family waiting for you back home. I was an orphan. I had no one. It took winning the games to find my family.” Denton thanked him and decided to retire to his quarters. Laika eventually returned to the lounge and the two mentors discussed their tributes. 

The next morning, the hoverjet landed on the Capital runway with crowds of fans flocking to see this year’s tributes. District 12 had the second highest attendance of the year due in part to their great track record for quell events. Corpse and Laika were extra nervous because of the fact and anxiously prepared their tributes for the Capital. Denton was unsure of what to say or do as he had no skill or interesting story to tell like Alyssa. Alyssa suggested he make something up but Laika shut the idea down since the analysts would know and possibly use it against him. Corpse offered to stay beside him the whole time and Denton felt reassured. Alyssa decided to take the Jase Toliver approach and lean into the criminal labels. Laika warned her to not divulge her connection with the Prospector and Alyssa playfully said, “Cross my heart and hope to die. Whoops sorry.” Laika gave her the stink eye before confirming with Corpse to open the doors.

The doors opened and the Capital greeted District 12 warmly. While there were many who wanted to see the victors, Alyssa and Denton had many visitors as well. Denton latched himself to Corpse and was shy around the many citizens swarming around him. Denton tried to hide from the paparazzi but Corpse insisted he introduce himself. Denton then said, “But Andrew…” Capitalites were surprised by the use of Corpse’s birth name and began asking Denton many questions about his life, thinking the relationship was special. Denton sheepishly revealed his dyslexia and school grades but what intrigued his fans the most was his favorite game: jacks. 

A small Capital kid had a set of metal jacks and balls and asked to play. Denton agreed and the two sat down on the floor to play. The Capital viewers were astonished by Denton’s incredible hand coordination as he threw the ball up and swiped the jacks in quick succession. Denton won the game near instantaneously and the crowd surrounding them went wild. He took pictures with the little kid before posing for photos with other fans. Corpse beamed with pride as he watched his mentee endear himself to the Capital.

Alyssa had a very different experience on the runway. She was a beam of confidence as she paroled down the runway and took pictures with people. A group of teen girls began playfully heckling her to which she responded with, “You want a shiv to your black hole? Keep talking.” The girls froze and Alyssa played it off as a joke. She started boasting about her street cred and received mixed responses ranging from laughter to concerned disbelief. One skeptical man questioned how she had street cred if she was in jail. Alyssa stepped closer and began teasingly mocking his disbelief. The man revealed himself to be a former District 12 peacekeeper and combatted her jests by revealing to nearby listeners that inmates weren’t allowed on the streets after prosecution, so Alyssa’s self-proclaimed “street cred” was false. 

Alyssa ceased her teasing and with a serious face claimed that she did have cred but for something no one else knew about. To the shock of everyone in attendance, she revealed her relation to the Prospector and the gash in her arm. Alyssa triumphantly proclaimed to be as much a victim as Laika, calling them “trauma sisters”. She declared that she would prevail and win the games to further erase any influence the Prospector posthumously has. The crowds changed their tune and cheered for her as the greatly embarrassed Laika escorted her to the limousine.

During the ride, Corpse praised Denton for his good behavior but was more surprised by the trick he displayed. Denton blushed and said he was always played with his siblings and other classmates. Corpse felt his exceptional hand coordination would serve him well in training and asked Laika if she agreed. Laika was staring down Alyssa, upset she went against her wishes. Alyssa explained that if she didn’t reveal it sooner, it would’ve come up later on anyway citing Spruce Queensberry (victor of the 19th Hunger Games) as a prime example. Laika still didn’t say anything so Denton asked if she believed her. Alyssa was going to respond but Laika shushed her exasperatedly saying, “I believe you ok.” Alyssa smiled and thanked her saying in a joking manner, “No one’s ever said that to me before.”  

The group arrived at the penthouse floor of the accommodation building. Alyssa and Denton relaxed on their beds in their separate rooms. Laika was about to call the usual District 12 stylist Flamenco Perez but was stopped by Corpse. He called Alyssa and Denton back out and told them the stylist was outside. Laika was confused and wanted to know where their usual stylist Flamenco Perez was, but her question was answered when the door opened, and a man entered the room with bundles of fabrics in his hand. Corpse introduced everyone to Ryanus Pollock, the new stylist for District 12. Corpse explained that he was one of the fashion designers for the clothing brands Corpse used to model for and was chosen to replace Flamenco, who was transferred to be District 9’s stylist after their old stylist Lolly Parker was fired for insubordinate behavior. 

Alyssa chuckled at the term since it was one her handlers used every time she was confined to her cell. Denton shook Ryanus’s hand and offered to help carry the fabrics. Ryanus rewarded him with a lollipop and decided to openly discuss his ideas for the parade. Most agreed upon the oil refinery uniforms with leaking “oil” but Alyssa liked the doctor outfits with realistic organs better. The idea was shut down due to Denton’s aversion to blood and the negative impact the amount of shock value could bring. Alyssa teased Denton for his fear, wondering how he would cope when the games began. Laika ordered her to her room to change. Denton sat down to watch the reaping commentaries to see if there were any other tributes with dyslexia. Instead of a recap, he was treated to the monumental reaping that took place in District 2.",1,1750644309.0,christianblanco,0,1.0,False

# Potent Cannabis-Infused Fruity Pebbles Treats (ABV Cannabutter)

This recipe uses ABV (Already Been Vaped) cannabis, which is already decarboxylated and ready for infusion. Based on your specific ABV (14g from 30% THC flower, vaped at 356°F, single pass, light brown color), your homemade cannabutter is estimated to contain **~4.14 mg THC per gram**.

If you follow this recipe exactly using **76 grams of your cannabutter and divide the treats into 12 servings**, each serving will contain approximately **26.2 mg THC**.

**Cannabis edibles can have a delayed and intense effect.**
* **START LOW AND GO SLOW!** If you are new to edibles or unsure of your tolerance, consume only a small piece (e.g., 1/4 or 1/2 of a planned serving) and wait **at least 1-2 hours** to assess the effects before consuming more.
* **Keep out of reach of children and pets.** Label clearly.

## Part 1: Homemade ABV Cannabutter

**Yield:** ~152 grams / 5.3 oz
**Estimated Total THC in this Butter After Extraction:** ~630 mg THC

### Ingredients - Cannabutter:
* 14 grams (1/2 ounce) of ABV (Already Been Vaped) cannabis from a single pass through a **dry herb vaporizer** (such as a **Mighty+, PAX Plus, or Arizer Solo 3**) at 356°F, original flower ~30% THC. (Color: normal brown, not real dark)
* 1 (8 oz / ~227g) stick of butter (any brand is fine!)
* Several cups of clean water

### Equipment - Cannabutter:
* Nut milk bag (or cheesecloth)
* Large saucepan or pot
* Spatula or spoon
* Container for chilling (e.g., glass bowl or deli container)
* **Optional for Water Wash/Straining:** French press, spice or coffee grinder (e.g., Krups)

### Instructions - Cannabutter:

1.  **Water Wash the ABV (Optional but Recommended):** Place the 14g of ABV into a nut milk bag (or wrap in cheesecloth). Submerge it in clean, cool water and let it steep for a few minutes. Squeeze out the dirty water and repeat this process multiple times until the water runs mostly clear. This process is recommended to **reduce the cannabis flavor and color** in your final butter. Squeeze out excess water thoroughly.
    * **ABV Grinding Tip:** Some people prefer to grind their ABV further in a spice or coffee grinder (like a Krups) before infusing. The finer the powder, the more efficient the extraction of cannabinoids. However, be aware that very fine powder can make filtration more difficult.
    * **French Press for Water Wash/Straining:** A French press can be a viable option for steeping and straining your ABV during the water wash, and even for straining the butter after infusion. However, it may be more prone to clogging if the ABV is too finely ground.

2.  **Combine & Simmer:** In your saucepan, combine the ""cleaned"" ABV, the entire 8 oz (~227g) stick of butter, and about 3-4 cups of clean water. The water helps regulate the temperature and prevents the butter from burning, and also helps separate impurities.

3.  **Gentle Infusion:** Bring the mixture to a very gentle simmer (do not boil rapidly) over low heat. Let it simmer uncovered for **2 hours**, stirring occasionally. Maintain a low bubble, if any.

4.  **Cool & Strain:** After 2 hours, remove from heat. Carefully add a few cups of cold water to the mixture in the pot. This helps cool it down and can aid in separating the butter. Strain the entire liquid mixture through your nut milk bag (or cheesecloth, or French press) into your chilling container, squeezing out as much liquid from the ABV as possible. Discard the spent plant material.

5.  **Chill to Separate:** Place the container with the liquid in the refrigerator. As it cools, the butter will solidify and form a ""green brick"" on top of the water. This usually takes **1 to 2 hours. At least.**

6.  **Harvest Cannabutter:** Once fully solidified, carefully remove the solid butter brick from the container. Discard the cloudy water underneath (this contains impurities). Pat the butter dry with paper towels to remove any residual moisture.

7.  **Weigh & Store:** Weigh your finished cannabutter. You should have approximately **152 grams**. Your cannabutter is now ready! Store any unused portion in an airtight container in the refrigerator for **2-3 weeks**, or in the freezer for **up to 6 months** (for best potency and freshness, wrap tightly in plastic wrap then foil, or use a freezer-safe airtight container).

## Part 2: Cannabis-Infused Fruity Pebbles Treats

**Estimated Potency Per Serving (1 of 12): ~26.2 mg THC**

### Ingredients - Fruity Pebbles Treats:
* 76 grams (approx. 5.3 tablespoons or just over half of your homemade cannabutter)
* 1 (10.5 oz) bag of mini marshmallows (reserving 1-2 cups for later, if desired)
* 1 (10 oz) box of Fruity Pebbles cereal (approximately 10-11 cups)

### Equipment - Fruity Pebbles Treats:
* Large mixing bowl
* Large microwave-safe bowl OR large non-stick pot
* 9x13 inch baking pan
* Spatula (greased or buttered)
* Parchment paper (optional, for easy removal)

### Instructions - Fruity Pebbles Treats:

1.  **Prepare Pan:** Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with butter or cooking spray. For easier removal, you can line it with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides.

2.  **Melt Butter:** In a large microwave-safe bowl (or large non-stick pot over low heat on the stove), melt the **76 grams of your homemade cannabutter**.

3.  **Melt Marshmallows:** Add the remaining mini marshmallows (all but the 1-2 cups you may want to reserve) to the melted cannabutter.

    * **Microwave Method:** Microwave on high for 30-second intervals, stirring well after each, until the marshmallows are completely melted and smooth. This usually takes 1.5 to 2 minutes total.

    * **Stovetop Method:** Continue to stir constantly over low heat until the marshmallows are completely melted and smooth. Do not let the mixture burn.

4.  **Combine with Cereal:** Remove the marshmallow mixture from the heat. Pour the entire 10 oz box of Fruity Pebbles cereal into the bowl with the melted marshmallow and butter.

5.  **Optional: Add Reserved Marshmallows:** If you reserved 1-2 cups of marshmallows, toss them in now. Stir just enough to incorporate them; they will partially melt, creating gooey pockets.

6.  **Mix Thoroughly:** Using a greased or buttered spatula, mix vigorously until the cereal is completely coated with the marshmallow mixture. Work quickly, as it will start to set.

7.  **Press into Pan:** Transfer the mixture into your prepared 9x13 inch baking pan. Using your greased spatula (or your hands lightly buttered), gently press the mixture evenly into the pan. Do not press too hard, as this can make the treats too dense and hard.

8.  **Cool & Cut:** Let the treats cool completely at room temperature for at least 30-60 minutes, or in the refrigerator for faster setting. Once firm, cut into 12 even squares or bars.

### Storage:
Store your cannabis-infused Fruity Pebbles treats in an airtight container at room temperature for up to **3-5 days**. For longer storage, you can freeze the treats for **up to 3 months**. To freeze, wrap individual pieces tightly in plastic wrap or parchment paper, then place them in a freezer-safe airtight container or freezer bag. Thaw at room temperature before enjoying. Label clearly and keep out of reach of children and pets.

I focus on my breathing. I feel like I could stay here forever. 

I’m gonna do it.

My bladder has other ideas. Fuck. 

No. Jesus Christ. One time was enough. 

I have to get up. 

Slowly, carefully, I push myself up while my body attacks me in protest. Oh fuck, I think to myself as I stumble and grab hold of my cabinet, knocking over a photo in the process. 

“Cheese!”, we all say, my wife and two kids. Smiling. Happy. We had just got off that Avatar ride at Disney. God, that was a lot of money. I can’t believe it was just a few months ago. Now look at me.

I don’t know if it was a conscious thought or if it was just a reflex. I have to stop drinking. What kind of a man can’t even get up to piss? The bathroom is so far away. Hold on a second. I know what you’re thinking. Ralph, just go to the balcony and piss. Nobody will see. 

Well, that’s a damn fine idea. 

I hobbled out toward the balcony, miles closer than the bathroom, and stumbled out the door. I take in the view. It’s not much. I’m just facing the other building. Rows upon rows of balconies, the same quiet monotony. I didn’t really want to stay here, but it was the cheapest option on such short notice. 

I began to laugh to myself. Hahahahaha. Quiet at first. But something came over me. 

I AM KING OF THE WORLD! 

I shouted as I whipped it out and started pissing. Don’t act like you’ve never done it. 

The piss steams in the air and it feels like victory. I lean on the railing, grinning like a dumbass. Proud, pathetic? Who’s asking?

My eyes skim across the balconies, still chuckling to myself, when my heart sinks. There’s someone standing across from my balcony. 

Was he there a minute ago? How did I miss him? I’m just drunk. He’s so tall. And he’s not moving. What is that about?

My thoughts immediately began to spiral as my mouth decided it wasn’t waiting for me any longer.

“Hey! Enjoying the show?” I shouted, surprised to hear my voice. 

No response. No movement, even. I squint, trying to see a face, an outline, anything. I don’t know anyone around here. But it’s mostly old folks and broke college kids. Geriatric fucks. 

I blink. 

Still there.

Blink again. 

Still there. 

I wipe my eyes and laugh, more halfheartedly than before, the nausea of the whiskey setting in, “Alright. You win the pissing contest, pal. I’m going back inside.”

Probably just couldn’t hear me. 

I think to myself. I lock the sliding door as I stumble back inside, unsure why. 

I don’t remember getting back to the couch. But I remember the cold following me back inside. The feeling of being watched. I sleep like shit. 

Morning.

My head is fucked. I’m out of ibuprofen. What’s the daily limit? Half a bottle? Whatever. 

I make my coffee with shaking hands and avoid looking out the window. 

Hell, I haven’t even turned on the lights in the kitchen because of the pounding in my head. 

As I start my morning routine of not brushing my teeth and pouring a splash of whiskey into my coffee, I notice a letter on the floor. 

A letter?

No, this is just a piece of notebook paper. 

It’s not in an envelope. Just a scrap, messily torn on the edges. Written in thick, crooked black ink:

“Try again tonight. You didn’t see it.”

The fuck does that mean?

I check the lock. Still bolted. I check the peephole. Empty hallway. I check my pulse. Still ticking, I guess.

I toss the paper on the counter as my headache demands my attention back. I can’t think about some creep leaving me messages that look like they forgot how to write. 

I sit down with my spiked coffee and watch steam curl off the mug. I don’t turn on the TV.

Don’t check my phone. I just sit there like I’m in timeout. 

Shit. What the hell was that note about?

My answering machine beeps. It’s programmed to start playing every day at 12pm, bright and early. 

“Ralph. This is the fourth time I’m calling. You have to call me back. Ignoring me is not going to solve the problem. It’s not gonna go away. If you don’t come to the deposition, they’re going to wind up forcing you. Please. It’s what the kids want. Call me back.”

My eyes waver in and out of focus. Nothing matters, really. I’m just another deadbeat in the books. Might as well own it. 

I tip the bottle into my coffee and throw on some football highlights. It’s gonna be a long day.

Night Two.

Did I doze off? Nothing like a midday nap. It’s late. 

I didn’t plan on going back out there. But why not? This is the most interesting thing to happen in three months. I have nobody. There are exactly two neighbors here who know my name, and one of them calls me Roger. So yeah. 

I’m back outside. Surprisingly, I didn’t grab the whiskey. I was locked in. 

Camping chair, cell phone. I sit and wait. I try to pass the time by counting lights in windows. By guessing which apartments are still occupied, which are shells. 

At 3:07 AM, in the midst of cleaning up to go back inside, I see it. 

Same building. But lower. 

One floor flower. 

And floating.

Hanging inches above the concrete like it forgot how gravity works. 

I don’t say anything this time. I just stare. Hard. Trying to see. But there’s no detail. Just that same shape. Tall, narrow, thick like a shadow. 

I raise my phone to snap a picture. Screen flickers. Still can’t make it out. I lower the phone, and the figure is gone. 

What the fuuuuuuck?

My eyes scan around, frantically looking for it, before my brain kicks in. 

Nah, fuck this.

I run inside, leaving my chair sitting there, and lock the door. What the hell was that? It just left a feeling of dread in my stomach. Maybe it’s the fact I haven’t drank in four hours. I have to be going into psychosis. 

Then I see it. 

Another note. 

Same paper, same ink. 

“Don’t blink so slow next time.”

I read the note. Then I hear the chair creak. 

The one I left outside. 

I freeze. 

There’s no wind tonight; the kind of stillness that wraps around you like a held breath. I tell myself the building shifted. But I didn’t believe it.

God, I need a drink. 

I take one step toward the sliding door, but I stop.

The reflection in the glass. 

Oh shit. 

There’s a shape behind me. Tall. Narrow. Still. 

I can’t turn around. Everything in my body is trying to pull me down. I’m sinking. I can’t move. Is this a panic attack?

What do I do?

The shape wasn’t there five seconds ago. It couldn’t have been. It’s inside my apartment. In my fucking kitchen. No feet. Just shadow down to air. 

I squeeze my eyes shut. Open them. Still there. It hasn’t moved. But the reflection is clearer. 

I can see the spindly, long limbs. The way it pulsed like a coat full of wet bones. 

Its arms hang too low. Elbows dragging near its hips. Fingers like snapped violin strings. Thin. Twitching. I thought it wasn’t moving, but it never stops moving. Micromovements. 

Its joints stutter every few seconds, like it’s buffering. One shoulder rolls, then jerks back like it regrets it. Its torso sways gently. 

And the skin. 

The skin’s not skin. It’s like a white sheet made out of plastic wrap. Pulled over ground meat. Tight in some places, sagging in others. There’s a part near the ribs where it looks chewed through, like something gnawed from the inside. I can’t see the face. My brain won’t do it. It refuses.

The thing twitches. A shiver zips through it like a power surge. Each bone pops under the skin in a wave, pop-pop-pop-pop, like popcorn cooking in wet cement. 

Something takes over me and I turn around to run. I’m already halfway to the door when I realize. 

It’s gone. 

I spin in circles. Empty. Nothing. 

And then I feel it. Cold fingers, if you could call them that, pressing gently on the back of my neck like a collection of zip ties. 

Then the voice. 

It was beautiful. 

Everything felt like peace after that. 

It said to me, breath cool and calming like a childhood memory, pressing each word into my brain like a hand through wet fabric, “You saw it wrong.”

And it was right. I’ve been here for weeks now. 

It is beautiful. 

It is godly. 

It is holy. 

There is nothing more to this world than these four walls. 

I have everything I need. I don’t eat. I’m getting thinner. I listen to the gospel. I sing hymns I wrote myself. 

I’m going to be just like It. ",1,1750644020.0,u_Interesting_Shake999,0,1.0,False
1li4ris,https://www.reddit.com/r/1800Drama/comments/1li4ris/update_wibtd_if_i_told_my_grieving_friend_i_have/,UPDATE: WIBTD if I told my grieving friend I have feelings for him?,"Hi, peaches! My WIBTD was featured on the ""Ive had this secret for 20 years…"" episode posted on YouTube on 09 Dec 2024 and, as luck would have it, that is the only episode of 1800Drama I somehow managed to miss. So, now that I've listened to it, I wanted to come on here and give more info and update you on the situation.

Now that I've written this, wow! I am sorry it's so long and potentially unnecessarily detailed.  
I apologize if some of this is weirdly phrased; English is not my first language.

INFO: 

1. Of the four years I had known him up until the point of my original post, he was in the talking stage with someone the summer we had met and then in a relationship with that person on-again-off-again for about three years. 

2. He finally ended that relationship about three or four months before his mother died, i.e. 7-8 months before my original post. I'm not sure about the exact timeline, as I was told about the breakup by a mutual friend and not by my crush directly. Probably irrelevant, but the relationship was overall bad (his partner cheated, was manipulative, and mistreated my crush in other ways). 

3. I had been single during that entire time and we were both single at the time of my original post. 

4. The occasions when we were alone together happened organically. 

5. The grief I was referring to in the title was the grief over his mother, not over his relationship, although I am not familiar with how over his relationship he was or wasn't at the time of my original post.

6. Jamie was right - my crush moved in with his family to look after them and then returned to his own place. He had been back at his apartment for about a month.

7. He did return to work during my trip, but only just. He had planned to take another month off and then decided against it.

THE SEQUEL:

I did end up telling him during the trip (literally the morning of the day I left). Even in retrospect, I don't think the reason why I felt the urge to put it out in the open then and there had anything to do with the fact that I was leaving soon. 

What I had failed to take into consideration is that a) I am a socially awkward person, and b) I have never in my life told someone I liked them in person without them already knowing (my previous relationships all started online and were long distance, so by the time we managed to meet, it was clear we fancied each other and were practically in a relationship already). 

For some additional context, the village is one of those everyone-knows-each-other-and-they're-all-up-in-your-business types. For this reason, and for the fact that the topic was sensitive, I was hoping we could have the conversation somewhere private. 

Alas, no such luck. There had been a moment where I could have addressed it a few days prior, but he ended up leaving abruptly. So I messaged him to tell him we needed to talk about something (in retrospect, a mistake, though I did tell him it was nothing bad or scary), and we met up for coffee. In the village. In a cafe in the middle of the village. Right after Sunday mass, when the largest amount of people would be out and about and going for coffee as well. I was hoping he would invite me over to his place (I had been there before), but he told me later that it was a mess, so I assume that's why he didn't.

It didn't go well. I was very nervous. We spent about half the time with him trying to persuade me to tell him what was the matter and me giggling and drinking copious amounts of water. He ended up getting nervous as well. He asked if we should go on a walk a few times (which I now realize was an attempt to get us away from the people \[listening in\], but I was oblivious as to why at the time, and we stayed put). He basically guessed it rather than me actually saying it. This is how that went down, roughly:

Him: Is it about a relationship?  
Me: A relationship?  
Him: Yeah.  
Me: Yes.  
Him: Between two people?  
Me: Yes.  
Him: Oh my god, Quincie, no. I'm gonna strangle you. Between whom?  
Me: (sarcastically) Guess.  
Him: Really? Since when?  
Me: It's been a while. \[I was too embarrassed to admit how long exactly.\]  
Him: Seriously?  
Me: Seriously.

He ended up telling me that he went into therapy when his mum died and that the therapist recommended that he not enter any kind of romantic relationship for at least a year (he had struggled with being on his own in the past). And that he was going to stick to that. He said he wanted to remain as we are for now and we will see what the future holds. 

Now, I had entered that conversation expecting he would say no, but really just hoping for a specific answer, whichever it was. I just wanted for the knot I had tangled myself into to come undone, one way or another.

So I told him that I can appreciate that, but that it isn't very specific. And he said it was as specific as he could be at this time. But that it wasn't going to change anything between us. 

I went home that evening. I texted him about a week later to ask how he was. He replied with something very noncommittal. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, so I replied to that in an attempt to turn it into a conversation with content, he replied ""haha"" or something. 

We basically didn't talk at all until he came to where I live four months later. We met in a group setting. He ruffled my hair and called me ""princess"", and I will grant you that may not be how he meant it, but I have never felt more infantilized in my life. Five days later we had a phone call in which he described how someone asked about who I was, and he replied: ""oh, that's my Quincie"".

That was essentially the last time we spoke. I sent him a funny picture of my cat at one point to which he responded with more content and enthusiasm than the message I sent him a week after I returned home.

He did message the group chat in February to thank us for the support and to inform us he feels the worst period is behind him (regarding his mother's passing).

In conclusion, I have no idea how I feel. Mostly I'm just sad, I think. I don't think I'm really over him. I have had several conversations with friends who told me that I (and anyone, really) deserve nothing short of an enthusiastic, over-the-moon ""YES!"" when I present someone with such a thing, and, rationally, I agree. Emotionally, I am not there yet, but I hope it won't take another four years to get there.

If you've made it to the end, thank you for reading all this drivel. I applaud you.

Much love,

Fashion Style Description

Overall look: The girl is wearing a customized Letterman Two Tone jacket made of Pink White. The unique two tone splicing design instantly becomes the visual focus, and the combination of pink and white is sweet and fresh, showing a youthful and vibrant atmosphere. Paired with a pair of white pants on the lower body, it is simple and clean, echoing the white part of the jacket, creating a harmonious overall look. Wearing a pair of pink basketball shoes complements the pink elements of the jacket, further enhancing the sweet and playful style.

Detail highlights: Customized Letterman jackets often come with unique decorative elements such as badges and embroidery, which add a touch of refinement and personality to the overall look. The choice of style for pink basketball shoes is also crucial, which may include unique lace design, sole texture, or brand iconic elements, making them a highlight of fashion while meeting the functional requirements of sports.

Style positioning: This outfit combines a sporty and sweet style, combining the vitality and dynamism of basketball shoes and jackets with the tenderness and sweetness of pink elements. It is suitable for girls who pursue fashion, personality, and love sports style.

Creating a scene atmosphere

Background on the bridge: A girl stands on the bridge, and the lines and structure of the bridge add a sense of toughness and modernity to the picture. Under the bridge, there may be flowing water or bustling city streets, and different background elements can create interesting contrasts or echoes with a girl's outfit. If there is flowing water under the bridge, the flowing water waves complement the lively outfits of the girl, creating a fresh and natural atmosphere; If it is a city street view, high-rise buildings and fashionable clothing for girls showcase the vitality and fashion of the city.

Light and shadow effects: The light and shadow effects on the bridge will also vary at different times. On a sunny day, the sun shines on the girl, making the pink of her jacket and basketball shoes even more dazzling, and the white pants also appear particularly bright, creating a vibrant atmosphere. At dusk, the soft afterglow draped a layer of golden veil over the entire scene, making the girl's outfit even more warm and romantic against the backdrop of light and shadow.

Character temperament display

Confident and energetic: Standing on the bridge wearing such a fashionable and energetic outfit, the girl shows a confident and energetic temperament. She walked lightly, her eyes revealing a love for life and unique insights into fashion, as if the whole world was under her feet.

Sweet and playful: The pink jacket and basketball shoes add a sweet and playful feeling to the girl, who may occasionally play with the hem of the jacket or playfully kick the basketball shoes under her feet, showing her innocent and playful side.

Suggested Applicable Scenarios

Campus activities: This outfit is very suitable for various activities on campus, such as sports events, club activities, etc. Girls can showcase their youthful energy and fashion taste during activities, becoming a beautiful scenery on campus.

Street Stroll: On weekend afternoons, girls wear this outfit and stroll on the streets, enjoying a leisurely time. Whether it's shopping, drinking coffee, or gathering with friends, it can easily attract everyone's attention.

Photo check-in: The unique scenery on the bridge complements the fashionable attire of the girl, making it perfect for photo check-in.

I'm speechless,"For context, I live in a slightly odd apartment complex that's literally right next to a hospital. Our driveway and the hospital drive way are less than five inches apart. The units are all ground level and have patios in the front (sectioned off by fences). My unit is the closest to the parking lot as well as the street, and has one of the largest patios.  
They are technically converted medical offices, but it's pretty clear that they're currently apartments. Like, I have well-loved furniture and fairy lights on my patio.   
I've been doing a seven day week for the last few months, getting up early and coming home late.  
I finally quit my job and have been spending more time at home.   
Imagine my fucking surprise when I was woken up on Saturday to voices outside my unit. They sounded weirdly close, and fairly loud. I was going to ignore it, but, like, it was 9am and I'd wanted to sleep longer.  
Went outside to check it out, and there were two women sitting at my outdoor dining set, coffee in hand, yapping it up.   
Bro. After asking them what the ever loving fuck they thought they were doing, it turns out they've been doing this for at least two months while their friend is in the hospital. They claimed they didn't know this wasn't part of the hospital.  
One of the women at least had the decency to seem apologetic, but still. You're full ass trespassing. It could not be more clear this is a residential area.   
I'm fucking confounded.   
Been internally screaming the entire week since I found out, but just need to vent into the void while I process.  
It feels so freaking violating.

Watching younger guys make the same mistakes I did, so here's what I wish someone had told me before I learned it the expensive way:

1. Your appearance matters way more than you think. Used to think ""looks don't matter, personality is everything."" That's half true but personality matters, but nobody gets close enough to see your personality if you look like you don't care about yourself. Started lifting weights, buying clothes that fit, and getting decent haircuts. People treat you completely differently. Not fair honestly but I had to live with it.
2. Most career advice is terrible. ""Follow your passion"" and ""do what you love"" sounds nice but pays terribly. Better advice: get good at something valuable, then find ways to enjoy it. Your dream job might be a nightmare with a boss and deadlines. Build skills that pay well first, then pursue passion projects on the side with actual money in the bank.
3. Networking isn't about using people. Spent years thinking networking was fake and sleazy. Turns out it's just being genuinely helpful to people in your field. Answer questions, share opportunities, make introductions. Most good jobs come through connections, not job boards. The guy who helped me get my current role? Met him in a random conversation at a coffee shop.
4. You can't negotiate from a position of weakness. Whether it's salary, relationships, or business deals - you need options to have leverage. Stay in shape so you're not desperate for any relationship. Keep your skills sharp so you're not desperate for any job. Save money so you're not desperate for any paycheck. Desperation kills your negotiating power.
5. Clean eating changes everything .Used to live on pizza, energy drinks, and whatever was convenient. Thought food was just fuel. Started eating actual meals with vegetables and protein. Energy levels stabilized, sleep improved, mood got better, even thinking got clearer. You literally are what you eat - choose accordingly.
6. Your 20s are for building, not consuming. Watched friends blow money on cars, clothes, and experiences while I was learning skills and saving. They looked cooler at 25, I look better at 32. Your 20s are when you have energy but no money. Use that energy to build skills, relationships, and savings. The fancy stuff can wait.
7. Most people don't think about you as much as you think Spent years worried about what others thought of my choices. Turns out most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to judge yours. That embarrassing thing you did last week? They already forgot. Make decisions based on what's good for you, not what looks good to people who aren't living your life.
8. Confidence comes from competence. ""Just be confident"" is useless advice. Confidence comes from knowing you can handle what comes up. Get good at things that matter fixing problems, making money, staying healthy, building relationships. When you know you can figure stuff out, confidence becomes automatic.
9. Your mental health affects everything else. Used to think therapy was for ""weak"" people and just powered through stress and anxiety. Finally got help at 29. Wish I'd done it at 19. Your brain is like any other part of your body sometimes it needs maintenance. Taking care of your mental health isn't weakness but maintenance.
10. Quality beats quantity in almost everything Better to have 3 close friends than 30 acquaintances. Better to own 5 high-quality items than 50 cheap ones. Better to be great at 2 skills than mediocre at 10. Better to have one meaningful relationship than a bunch of casual ones. Focus your energy on fewer things and do them well. I realized this after how my friend who hone his skill for a decade got a into a big internship after I have applied for it a lot of times.

I hope this helps. I just wanted you guys to learn this lessons. Took me so long and I want to preach it more. So you guys don't go through what I did.

Following up on the Ridge and Zinfandel action, .... Ridge tells me this is a ""Zinfandel Blend"". Blend of 72% Zinfandel, 15% Petite Sirah, 9% Carignane, 2% Alicante Bouschet, 1% Cinsault, and 1% Counoise. Tech sheet says
100% natural primary and secondary, aged 16 months in 100% air-dried American oak barrels (17% new, 3% one year old, 10% two years old, 10% three years old and 60% five plus years old).

Nose: wow, first pop and a bunch of red fruit emanates from the bottle. In the glass aromas of purple grapes, blackberries,  grapeskins, metallic grapes, with deeper inhalations showing more metal and light polish-related products. After an hour, the aromas significantly diminished.

Palate: light to medium body, entry is metallic grapes, mid palate hints of light vanilla, black tea, and cooking spices like sage and bay leaves, these slightly strengthen with each sip, bitter fruit stems, bitter fruit leaves, coffee, and then the grapes come out, while the tannins coat the mouth in powdery chalk, back palate has more wood related products (secondary). After an hour, the flavors significantly diminished, resulting in dry and moderately tannic grape juice, secondary elements seemed to have reduced the most.

Finish: medium, dry, chalk on a matrix of diminishing metal, hints of coffee and chocolate, subsequent sips have more participation from a fruity black tea. A large amount of interference from the powdery tannins, like young Bordeaux. After an hour, the finish is just dry and tannic.

Vernacular: nose is slightly primary with purple grapes but there is a higher than average amount of phenolics (tannic grapeskin aromas). Medium body, dry, light to medium acidity, dominant medium grained chalky tannins, medium minerality, medium oak influence, minimal alcohol. Medium finish, dry, tannins reinforce their grip, minimal alcohol.

A very tannic Zinfandel with much more secondary going on than primary. Strange that this quickly goes downhill once opened. Not as good as the 2022 Geyserville. Opened way too young, like young Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux. Tom Lee from Zinfandel Chronicles gave this a 94 in 2023, Tim Fish from Wine Spectator gave this a 93 in 2024, and depending on which website R.H. from Jancis Robinson gave this a 17+/20 which increased to 18++/20 in 2024.

1li4hui,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpookyPH/comments/1li4hui/moths_or_butterflies/,Moths or Butterflies?,"4:40 AM. I woke earlier than usual to get ready for work. The house was quiet except for the soft clinking of my father’s coffee cup outside—the kitchen is outdoors, as it often is in the mountains. 

Suddenly, I heard my mother murmuring from their room, caught in a nightmare. I quickly went to her and gently woke her up. Her mumbling stopped, and I stayed with her for a moment to make sure she was fully awake. After that, I returned to the living room. 

As I looked around, I noticed something—at first just one delicate flutter. Then another. Then more, until there were at least ten. At first, I thought they were butterflies. Maybe they were. 

Goosebumps spread across my skin. I called Papa outside to come and see. Curious, I asked him if anything like this had ever happened before. He paused and said no; it was unusual. 

I told him about Mama’s nightmare. He went to check on her. Soon, my mother came out and shared the dream—a disturbing vision about my aunt abroad, who appeared pregnant. My mother asked how many months along she was, but the details escaped me. What stuck with my mother was that my aunt’s fingers began decaying, as if she were already dead. That image shook her deeply, explaining the mumbling I had heard. I didn’t have time to ask more questions then—I needed to prepare for work—but I plan to ask her later. 

I stepped outside to prepare my bath. The CR—the outdoor restroom, as is common in the mountains—is separate from the house. I heard the fluttering wings again and caught sight of a yellow wing trying to get inside.  

This part terrified me. Immediately, I thought an engkanto—a spirit or supernatural being in Filipino folklore—was trying to communicate. I don’t know why I thought that at the moment. Silly, maybe. As someone who doesn’t easily believe in the paranormal or traditional signs, I tried to reason it out: maybe they were just attracted to the light I had just turned on. But then again, we have outdoor lights too—why weren’t they drawn to those? 

After my bath, when I went back inside, only four remained. The windows were closed, and I wondered if they had slipped through the small space near the roof. It was strange—almost as if this wasn’t just a coincidence but a quiet sign that something was shifting inside me too. 

Unable to resist, I searched right then and there: What does it mean when butterflies come to you? 

A few things popped up if they were indeed butterflies: 

Butterflies are often seen as symbols of transformation, rebirth, and new beginnings. In many cultures, they’re also believed to carry messages from the spirit world, sometimes from loved ones who have passed. 

And maybe that’s what this was—a message. 

That I’m in the process of becoming. 

That healing is happening, even if it’s quiet. 

That I’m not as alone as I feel. 

That change is here, slow but steady. 

And then, just as my father and I were ready to ride the motorcycle—something he usually do in the morning since he sends me off on the bus—a bee suddenly tried to sting me. It caught me off guard, and I couldn’t help but wonder: Why me? Why today? 

Between the butterflies, the fluttering wings, and now the bee, it feels like the day is full of messages—about change, protection, or awakening. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m starting to feel like I’m right in the middle of something bigger than myself. 

I’ve been trying to heal. The breakup left me raw, and therapy is helping me sort through grief and confusion, and the parts of myself I lost along the way. But this morning it felt different. Like my soul was whispering: You’re still here. You’re still becoming.  

I don’t know exactly what those butterflies meant. Maybe they weren’t outside of me at all. Maybe they are me—a quiet sign that healing is happening, even when I can’t see it. ",1,1750643019.0,SpookyPH,1,1.0,False

The blue light of the monitor was the only living thing in Ravi's
apartment at 3 AM. Shobha slept soundly in the next room, oblivious to
the quiet war being waged on the screen before him. He scrolled, zoomed,
parsed lines of Solidity, each character a silent witness. The new DeFi
lending protocol, `AetherLend`, was supposed to be their company's
triumph, a seamless conduit for digital wealth.

But Ravi, debugging a minor yield calculation discrepancy, had ventured
deeper than intended. He'd found it: not a bug, not an oversight, but a
deliberate, almost elegant **re-entrancy vulnerability** baked into the
core `withdraw` function. It wasn't an accident. It was a back door,
crafted with malicious intent, waiting for the right moment to siphon
untold millions from the protocol's liquidity pools.

His fingers, usually nimble, hesitated over the keyboard. The air
conditioner's low hum suddenly sounded like a distant siren. This wasn't
just code; it was a digital weapon, pre-set to detonate. And he, Ravi,
the kid who'd escaped the squalor of Mumbai with nothing but a sharp
mind, had stumbled into the blast radius.

The silence of the Silicon Valley night felt heavier now, pregnant with
consequences. He had just uncovered a crime, and the perpetrators would
know, soon enough, that he knew.

\*\*\*

Ravi stared at the glowing lines, the code now a coiled viper. Call Mr.
Chopra, his direct supervisor? The thought curdled in his stomach, sour
and bitter. Chopra, the silver-haired architect of AetherLend, whose
bland smiles now felt like masks, hiding something predatory.

*He remembered the first time he saw the black SUVs. It had been a
Tuesday, four months ago. Three identical vehicles, windows tinted to
absolute obsidian, had pulled up to the front entrance of their sleek
Silicon Valley office building. Out of them emerged a phalanx of men,
built like brick walls, with the unmistakable bearing of ex-military.
Their suits stretched taut over broad shoulders, and Ravi, catching a
glimpse of a bulk beneath one armpit, knew it was the outline of a
holstered weapon. They moved with an almost unnerving efficiency,
clearing a path for a man Ravi recognized from the company's internal
reports: Suleman, the lead investor. His face, usually smiling in press
photos, was a cold, hard mask as he swept into the building.*

*The air in the office had changed that day, becoming thicker, heavier.
Whispers had circulated about an impromptu, closed-door meeting with
Chopra.*

*Later that week, in Chopra's office Ravi had been called in, ostensibly
for a code review, but a subtle tension hung in the air. Alan, another
senior engineer, sat slumped in a chair opposite Chopra, his face pale,
eyes red-rimmed. Alan, who had been the lead on AetherLend's smart
contract security audits, had a habit of asking too many questions, of
digging too deep.*

*\""And for AetherLend,\"" Chopra had said, his gaze flicking between Alan
and Ravi, \""I wouldn't advise spending too much time digging into the
`AetherLend` core logic, Ravi. It's\... delicate. And already thoroughly
vetted.\"" Chopra's voice was smooth, but his eyes, usually placid, had
held a flicker of something close to a warning. \""Alan here had some\...
*concerns* about the scalability, but we've addressed them. Focus on the
front-end user experience. We need seamless integration, not\...
theoretical audits.\"" Alan hadn't said a word, just stared at the floor.
\""Trust in the system we've built.\""*

*Alan hadn't shown up to work the next day. Or the day after that. His
desk was cleared by the end of the week. No email, no goodbye. Just\...
gone. A quiet word from HR about \""personal leave\"" and then, \""Alan
decided to pursue other opportunities.\"" Ravi hadn't believed it for a
second. The chilling efficiency of his disappearance, coupled with the
arrival of Suleman and his enforcers, had painted a far darker picture.*

Ravi's jaw tightened. Trust. That word tasted like ash now. He couldn't
go to Chopra. He couldn't go to anyone inside. Alan's ghost hovered, a
silent testament to the price of asking too many questions.

Regulators. The SEC. They had to know. This wasn't just a vulnerability;
it was a weapon.

He acted with a precision born of urgency and a deep-seated paranoia he
rarely acknowledged. His old, rarely-used Android, wiped clean and
loaded with a secure messaging app, became his conduit. He routed his
connection through a triple-layered VPN, connecting to a public Wi-Fi
signal from a coffee shop down the street, hoping the pre-dawn quiet
would minimize digital noise. He drafted the message meticulously,
detailing the re-entrancy vulnerability, explaining its mechanics, the
potential for catastrophic fund drain. He attached screenshots,
transaction hashes, a clear exposition of the exploit.

He scrubbed his digital trail with practiced movements, the kind he'd
learned not in Silicon Valley, but in the dark corners of the web he'd
once navigated for survival. He felt a surge of triumph, a rush of
self-righteous adrenaline as he pressed 'send'. He'd done it. He'd
thrown a wrench into their corrupt machine.

*Error. Message too large. Attachment limit exceeded.*

Ravi cursed under his breath. He had to trim the proof. He quickly
condensed his explanation, removed redundant screenshots. He needed to
be concise, yet impactful. He scrolled back, highlighting the absolute
smoking gun: the precise line of Solidity code within the `withdraw`
function that contained the unguarded external call, and the unique,
proprietary internal function name that triggered
it---`_executePostWithdrawHook()`. This specific combination, this
precise fingerprint, was something only someone with direct access to
their private repository, someone who had just debugged that exact
module, could possibly possess. He included it.

He sent the message again. This time, it went through. A wave of
profound relief washed over him. Smart. So smart.

But 'smart' wasn't enough. Not against these people. He needed
insurance. A dead man's switch. He immediately spun up a disposable
virtual machine, encrypted the entire, comprehensive evidence package --
the full contract, the detailed analysis, the incriminating financial
flows he'd painstakingly mapped -- and uploaded it to a decentralized
storage network. Then, he configured a simple, robust cron job on a
series of anonymous servers spread across three continents. If he failed
to log into a specific, obscure SSH key within 48 hours, the job would
automatically publish a link to the encrypted data, along with a concise
explanation, to the 'New' section of Hacker News. It was an elegant,
terrifyingly effective deterrent. He smiled grimly. Now, if they came
for him, the world would still know. His final move. Invincible.

Miles away, in a secure, soundproof room, a screen glowed. An incoming
alert flashed. \""New Whistleblower Submission. Threat Level: High.\""

Below it, two lines of code blinked:

    // vulnerable re-entrancy point // 0x8A4B1F9E
    externalCall.call(gasLimit) // _executePostWithdrawHook()
    Source Signature Match: Ravi Sharma

A burly man with eyes like chipped flint, known only as Vladimir,
watched the screen. His lips curled into a slow, predatory smile. \""We
have a match,\"" he murmured, picking up his phone. \""Found our rat.\""

\*\*\*

Ravi stumbled into the bedroom, the blue glow of his phone a distant
echo in his mind. Shobha shifted, a soft murmur escaping her lips,
entirely unaware of the precipice he now stood upon. He stripped
quickly, the silk sheets feeling alien against his skin, a stark
contrast to the coarse blankets of his youth. He closed his eyes,
willing sleep to come, but his mind raced, replaying every line of code,
every keystroke, every calculated risk.

The silence of the room was suddenly oppressive, not the comforting
quiet of a safe haven, but the hollow stillness before a storm. He
turned onto his back, staring at the unseen ceiling, and the polished
hardwood floor beneath him warped, shifting into the cracked, grimy
concrete of a different world, a different night.

*Mumbai. Not the gleaming towers, but the cramped, suffocating alleys of
Dharavi. The air thick with the smell of sewage and spices, exhaust
fumes and desperation. He was twelve, scrawny, his ribs like washboards
under thin cotton. Survival was a daily negotiation, and a beating was a
common currency.*

*He'd found his protection in the flickering neon of an illegal
electronics repair shop, run by a one-eyed man named Karim. Ravi,
quick-witted and fascinated by circuits, absorbed everything. One
sweltering night, a local enforcer for the 'Red Cobra' gang, a squat man
with a gold tooth and a perpetually scowling face, burst in, demanding
Karim rig a shortwave radio. The police were cracking down, he barked,
and they needed to hear everything.*

*Ravi, hunched over a pile of wires and old transistors, had seen the
crude device Karim rigged. He'd seen its flaws. That night, under the
cover of the city's cacophony, while Karim slept, Ravi had slipped back
into the shop. He hadn't just 'rigged' it; he'd found a way to subtly
intercept their *specific* frequencies, feeding them misdirection,
creating phantom signals while simultaneously patching *actual* police
chatter back to the Cobra's receivers. It wasn't just a jammer; it was a
ghost in the machine.*

*The Red Cobra enforcer had returned, not with a beating, but with a
strange, appraising look. \""Karim, your boy\... he has clever hands.\""
From there, it had escalated. He wasn't just fixing radios; he was the
ghost, the whisperer. He mapped the city's CCTVs, found their blind
spots, developed crude, effective methods to disrupt rival gang
communications during turf wars, creating digital chaos that masked
real-world violence. He rose from scrawny kid to the Cobra's 'engineer',
invaluable, untouchable, shielded by their brutal power. He got new
clothes, enough food, even a small, relatively clean room. He felt safe,
for the first time.*

*Until the night the 'Big Boss', a man whose name was rarely spoken
above a whisper, summoned him. Ravi had been given a new, complex task:
penetrate the network of a rival, emerging crime lord, a tech-savvy
upstart who was beginning to encroach on the Cobra's lucrative narcotics
routes. Ravi, brimming with the confidence of his newfound status, had
gone too deep. He hadn't just found their network; he'd uncovered a
direct, undeniable link between the Big Boss and a series of
disappearances, not just rivals, but innocents, collateral damage
orchestrated with chilling precision. He'd even found a digital ledger,
evidence of the Big Boss planning to betray the Red Cobra enforcer who
had first brought Ravi into the fold. Ravi, caught between his loyalty
to the man who'd saved him and the terrifying truth, had hesitated.*

*He'd been too slow. The Big Boss had sensed it, seen the flicker of
fear, of knowledge, in Ravi's eyes. A cold, menacing smile had spread
across the Big Boss's face, a silent promise of retribution. Ravi knew,
with a gut-wrenching certainty, that he had become a liability. He had
seen too much. The next sunrise, he wasn't in Mumbai. He was on a cargo
ship, headed for a new world, leaving everything -- and everyone --
behind.*

Ravi's eyes snapped open. Silicon Valley. The drone of the AC. Shobha's
quiet breathing. He was here, safe. But the cold dread that had
accompanied him across continents, the same dread that had pushed him
onto that boat, was back. He had just tangled with a new kind of Big
Boss, and this one, he knew, played a far more sophisticated, far
deadlier game. He glanced at Shobha, then at the silent phone on his
nightstand. He wondered if Vladimir, or whoever he truly was, already
had her in his sights.

\*\*\*

Ravi was getting worried. He was refreshing the whistleblower portal,
but there was no update. Then the decision solidified in Ravi's mind,
hard and cold as the code he'd exposed. He needed to get away. He
couldn't tell Shobha. Not yet. Her worry, her fear, would be another
variable he couldn't control, a distraction he couldn't afford. Besides,
he'd already taken precautions. He was smart.

He walked into the bedroom, Shobha already stirring with the morning
light. \""Surprise,\"" he said, forcing a lightness into his voice he
didn't feel. \""Pack a small bag. Warm clothes, hiking boots. We're going
to Yosemite. I found a great little off-grid cabin. Impromptu road
trip.\""

Shobha blinked, stretching luxuriously. \""Yosemite? Now? You're not
working today?\"" She smiled, a soft, sleepy curve of her lips that
twisted a knife in his gut. \""Sounds like you need a break, my love. But
why so sudden?\""

\""Just an urge,\"" he said, shrugging, already turning to grab his own
small backpack. \""Fresh air. Digital detox.\"" His heart pounded with a
different kind of urgency. *Get her out. Now.*

The drive from their Mountain View apartment was deceptively ordinary.
Shobha, humming along to a Bollywood playlist, pointed out vineyards and
sleepy towns along Highway 120. Ravi kept his eyes on the rearview
mirror, checking, double-checking, his paranoia a cold knot in his
stomach. He saw nothing. A white Ford pickup, a nondescript sedan.
Nothing out of place. He relaxed, fractionally. His OpSec had been
flawless. The anonymous message, the VPNs, the careful scrubbing. He was
one step ahead.

He stole a glance at Shobha, her head tilted back, eyes closed in
contentment. He remembered that same look, years ago, at a chaotic
Indian student association Diwali party in Palo Alto. He was there on a
borrowed visa, working a cash-under-the-table job in a server farm, his
legal status a thin thread about to snap. He was just Ravi, a scrawny
kid from Dharavi with a brain full of code and a forged ID, trying to
disappear into the vast landscape of Silicon Valley's ambition.

*He'd seen her across the crowded hall, a luminous figure in a sparkling
lehenga, laughing with a group of impeccably dressed young NRIs. Shobha
Mehta. Daughter of Sanjeev Mehta, the famed tech investor, whose name
graced university buildings and philanthropic foundations. Everything
Ravi wasn't. He was a ghost in the system; she was Silicon Valley
royalty.*

*He'd ended up next to her at the chaat stall, both reaching for the
last pani puri. Their fingers brushed. She'd laughed, a bright, easy
sound. They talked. He found himself, for the first time in years, truly
talking about his passion for systems, for breaking them down and
building them better. Not the criminal kind, but the elegant kind, the
ones that could change lives. He hadn't revealed the depth of his past,
nor the precariousness of his present, but something in his intensity,
his raw intelligence, had caught her. She saw past the cheap shirt, the
slightly too-long hair. Her parents had been apoplectic. \""A boy
from\... nowhere, Shobha? With no papers? No prospects?\"" But Shobha,
stubborn and kind, had seen his fire. She'd believed in him, fought for
him. She was his anchor, his north star in this baffling new world. He'd
eventually secured a legitimate, if fragile, work visa, then the
sponsorship for a green card, a painstaking, years-long climb out of the
shadows. But the fear of exposure, of losing everything, never truly
left him.*

\""Ooh, stop here!\"" Shobha exclaimed, pointing to a battered sign
advertising \""The Foothills Fuel & Market.\"" It was a solitary outpost,
nestled between a dusty patch of trees and a desolate stretch of
highway, the last major stop for miles before the terrain truly began to
climb. A single, ancient pickup truck sat at one of the pumps, its
engine puttering. \""I need chips, and I swear, I just saw a vintage soda
machine inside.\""

Ravi pulled up to the other, equally ancient pump, its digits flickering
erratically. He noticed the pickup truck's driver, a burly man with a
baseball cap pulled low, getting back into his vehicle. The man glanced
their way for a fraction of a second, but Ravi dismissed it. Just
another traveler. \""Okay. I'll grab some water. Don't wander off.\"" He
gave her a quick, reassuring smile, trying to project normalcy. He'd be
quick. His mind was already calculating the remaining distance to the
cabin, the off-grid haven.

Inside, the market smelled of stale coffee and plastic. Ravi grabbed two
bottles of water, his mind still replaying lines of code, the precise
vulnerability, the elegance of his expose. He was still buzzing from the
intellectual victory. He even allowed himself a brief,
self-congratulatory thought: *They'll never trace that back to me. Too
clever.* He paid the laconic clerk, a woman chewing gum slowly, her eyes
fixed on a small TV behind the counter. He pocketed his change.

He pushed open the squeaky glass door, stepping back into the weak
afternoon sun. His eyes went immediately to their black Tesla Model 3.

The passenger door was open. Just slightly ajar.

His breath caught. Shobha wasn't there.

His gaze snapped to the gas pump, then swept the empty forecourt. The
pickup truck was gone. The vintage soda machine Shobha had pointed out
stood untouched, its bright red paint peeling. The only sound was the
distant drone of an unseen vehicle and the chirping of crickets already
starting their evening chorus.

\""Shobha?\"" His voice was a raw whisper, barely audible.

He stumbled to the Tesla, the open passenger door a gaping maw. Empty.
His heart hammered, a frantic drum against his ribs. No witnesses. No
struggle. Just an open door and a missing wife. He pulled out his phone,
his thumb hovering over the dial icon for 911. But then the Mumbai
darkness, the lessons of the street, flooded his mind. Police meant
questions. Questions meant papers, immigration status, the life he'd
built on a razor's edge. He couldn't risk it. Not yet.

His phone buzzed in his hand, a new, unknown number. A text message.

**`DELETE THE HACKER NEWS DEADMAN SWITCH. NOW. OR SHE SUFFERS. EVERY MINUTE YOU DELAY IS HERS. WE ARE WATCHING. – AETHERLEND SECURITY`**

The blood drained from Ravi's face. Panic, cold and sharp, clawed at his
throat. They knew. Not just that he'd blown the whistle, but *how*. They
knew about the switch. They were inside his head, watching his every
move, anticipating his every counter. The smug satisfaction of his
\""smart\"" plan evaporated, replaced by a gut-wrenching terror. Shobha.

For a terrifying second, his mind went blank, consumed by pure,
unadulterated fear. He wanted to scream, to run. But the instincts honed
in the brutal alleys of Dharavi, long dormant beneath layers of code and
corporate jargon, began to surface. Panic was a luxury he couldn't
afford. He was no longer the Silicon Valley engineer; he was the ghost,
the shadow, the one who survived.

He forced himself to breathe, deep, ragged gulps of the dusty air.
*Observe. Adapt. Attack.*

His eyes, now sharp and predatory, swept the desolate forecourt. The
vintage soda machine. The grimy windows of the market. And then he saw
it. Perched high on the corner of the building, above the faded
\""Foothills Fuel & Market\"" sign, a small, dome-shaped security camera.
A second one, less obvious, aimed at the pumps. They were old, probably
low-res, but they were there.

He walked back into the market, his gait now calm, purposeful. Behind
the counter, a young girl, probably no older than seventeen, with
headphones perched precariously on her head, scrolled idly on her phone,
utterly oblivious.

Ravi adopted his 'fixer' persona, the one he used to talk down irate
clients or charm his way past stubborn network protocols. He walked up
to the counter, pulling a worn, generic-looking multi-tool from his
pocket. \""Excuse me,\"" he said, his voice a practiced blend of authority
and weary professionalism. \""Hi. My name's Roy. I'm with 'Foothills
Security Solutions'. We're here for the routine quarterly check on your
surveillance system. Your manager scheduled this for\... what was it
again? Mid-afternoon today?\"" He gestured vaguely towards the cameras.

The girl looked up, pulling one headphone off. \""Uh, really? No one told
me. Brenda's not here. She went to the doctor.\"" She blinked, bored.
\""You need to, like, fix the cameras?\""

\""Just a routine maintenance check, hon,\"" Ravi assured her, leaning
slightly over the counter. He lowered his voice conspiratorially. \""You
know how these older systems are. If we don't keep an eye on them, the
feed just\... disappears. Then you're stuck without coverage if anything
happens.\"" He let the last words hang in the air, a subtle nudge.

The girl's eyes widened fractionally. \""Oh. Okay. The monitor's in the
back, in the office. You just, uh, go straight back.\"" She waved vaguely
towards a narrow corridor. \""Door's unlocked.\""

\""Perfect. Thanks a million.\"" Ravi gave her a reassuring nod and strode
through the back, his heart pounding, but his face a mask of
professional nonchalance.

The small office was cramped, smelling of dust and stale coffee. On a
wobbly desk sat an old CRT monitor, displaying a grainy, flickering
four-way split screen of the gas station. Ravi wasted no time. He found
the system's clunky interface, navigated past the confusing menus, and
within seconds, located the archived footage from the last half hour. He
rewound.

There. The black Tesla. Shobha laughing, getting out. Ravi going inside.
And then, the black SUV he hadn't noticed, pulling up silently behind
their car, its engine cut. Two figures, obscured by the low angle and
poor resolution, emerging. A swift, brutal efficiency. Shobha, her head
twisted sharply back, a muffled sound. And then, the open passenger
door. The SUV peeled away, merging seamlessly back onto the highway as
Ravi walked out of the store.

His eyes burned. He zoomed in, fighting the pixilation. The rear of the
SUV. He squinted, adjusted the contrast. There. Four letters. Three
numbers. **CA License Plate: 8R2P774**.

He memorized it, then deleted the clip from the system's memory, wiping
his access logs for good measure. He left the office, mumbled a quick
thanks to the still-distracted girl, and was back in his Tesla.

No time for panic now. He wasn't looking for police. He was looking for
a ghost.

His phone, a new burner he'd bought months ago as part of his general
OpSec, hummed to life. He tapped furiously, his fingers dancing across
the screen. Public records for the license plate. *No match. Stolen, or
unregistered.* Of course.

But the plate was a key. He didn't need the DMV. He needed the eyes of
the city. He connected to a series of dark web proxies, then burrowed
deep. Municipal traffic camera networks. Most were poorly secured,
default passwords, known exploits. A forgotten skill, honed in the
shadows of Mumbai, now repurposed. He needed a back door, a way in. He
found a vulnerability in an outdated firmware for a common traffic
management system used by many county and state agencies. A quick Python
script, a burst of data, and he was through.

He bypassed firewalls, hopped servers, ignoring the blaring intrusion
alerts he left in his wake. He wrote a quick script, feeding it the
license plate number, instructing it to scan traffic camera feeds for
that specific pattern. He watched the map on his screen, a network of
green dots across California, each a traffic camera. He expanded his
search radius from the gas station.

Minutes crawled by. And then, a flicker. A hit. East of Fresno, then
south. Another. They were moving fast. His script followed the trail,
jumping from camera to camera, highway to interchange, an invisible
tracker. The dots on the map moved relentlessly, a digital breadcrumb
trail leading away from the major freeways, into the desolate industrial
outskirts of a city he didn't recognize.

Finally, the trail ended. A cluster of green dots, all pointing to the
same location. An abandoned district, warehouses stretching for blocks.
One specific address, glowing red on his map.

**Warehouse 7, Industrial Way, Firebaugh, CA.**

He was coming, Shobha. He was coming.

\*\*\*

The hum of the Tesla felt like a caged beast as Ravi drove, leaving the
gas station a receding smudge in his rearview. He knew where he had to
go first. Not home. Not to the police. To a ghost from his past, a man
who dealt in shadows and hard currency.

Hours later, deep in a forgotten corner of the Central Valley, nestled
between abandoned orchards and rusting farm equipment, Ravi pulled up to
a grimy, unmarked warehouse. The single dim bulb over the loading bay
cast long, shifting shadows. He killed the engine.

The door creaked open. Alejandro. Older, grayer, but the same cold,
calculating eyes. He wore a stained apron over a t-shirt, surrounded by
a chaotic inventory of night vision goggles, military-grade comms
equipment, and crates of what looked suspiciously like rifle parts.
Alejandro didn't ask questions. He didn't offer sympathy. He just
listened to Ravi's clipped, urgent requests.

\""Miniature drone,\"" Ravi stated, his voice tight. \""High-res, low-light
capable. Jammers. Comms interceptors. The kind that can cut through
anything.\""

Alejandro nodded, rummaging through a shelf stacked with unmarked boxes.
\""Old habits die hard, eh, *engineer*? Still breaking the rules. You
need something for... close encounters too?\"" He held up a sleek, black
.22 caliber pistol, small enough to disappear into a palm.

Ravi hesitated, then took it. The cold steel felt familiar, heavy with
memory.

*The alley reeked of blood and cheap liquor. Ravi, barely seventeen, had
been cornered by two of the rival gang's muscle, payback for a
particularly audacious comms hack. He'd ducked a swinging pipe, felt a
fist graze his temple. He knew this wasn't a negotiation. He had no
knife, no gang backup. Only the small, single-shot revolver he'd stolen
from a drunk, off-duty cop days earlier, a foolish, desperate whim. He
remembered the tremor in his hand, the way the cheap gun bucked in his
palm, the deafening crack in the narrow space. One shot. Not to kill,
but to maim. The scream of the larger man as he clutched his knee, the
sudden, wild fear in the eyes of his partner, their retreat into the
darkness. Ravi hadn't looked back. He'd just run, the taste of fear and
metal a bitter memory in his mouth.*

He shoved the pistol into his waistband, the unfamiliar bulk a grim
comfort. \""Good measure,\"" he muttered to Alejandro. \""What do I owe
you?\""

Alejandro gave him a price that made his Californian salary feel like
pocket change, but Ravi transferred the crypto without a blink. Shobha
was worth more than every line of code he'd ever written.

\*\*\*

The drive to Firebaugh was a blur. Night had fallen, thick and starless.
He parked the Tesla two miles from the warehouse, tucked deep into a
stand of eucalyptus trees. He assembled the drone, a spider-like
construct of carbon fiber and micro-propellers. He launched it, sending
it silently into the black sky.

On his tablet, the drone's thermal camera painted the warehouse in
ghostly greens and yellows. He mapped the perimeter, the few guards,
their heat signatures like glowing embers against the cold concrete. He
noticed something else, too: an unusual network of large pipes running
along the ceilings inside, visible through gaps in the roof, and
clusters of what looked like industrial-grade nozzles. And a distinct,
almost historical, chemical symbol stenciled on an old, faded sign near
the back entrance: a triangle with a drop, usually denoting a highly
specialized fire suppression system. A legacy from its previous life.
Vladimir wouldn't know it was still operational.

Ravi grinned, a feral glint in his eyes.

He circled the warehouse, his fingers dancing across the tablet, using
the drone to identify the main power conduit. With a small, focused EMP
device Alejandro had supplied, jury-rigged to the drone, he flew it low,
near the main junction box. A faint pop, a flicker, and the entire block
of warehouses plunged into darkness. Alarms blared, muffled and
distorted by the jammers Ravi had activated, creating a localized static
field around the area.

Confusion erupted inside. Figures, illuminated by the drone's night
vision, stumbled in the sudden dark. This was his moment.

He moved like a shadow, low to the ground, relying on the map he'd
memorized from the drone footage. He found the access panel for the old
fire suppression system, a relic of the warehouse's chemical past. The
override was ancient, but the mechanism was still robust. He bypassed a
rusted lock, connected his wires, and sent a powerful surge.

Deep within the warehouse, a low groan, then a hiss. Above, the nozzles
exploded to life, not with water, but with a torrent of thick, white
foam, followed by a deluge of high-pressure water. The facility was
instantly transformed into a chaotic, blinding maelstrom of suds and
spray, the shouts of the guards echoing, disoriented.

Ravi plunged into the churning chaos. He located Shobha's heat signature
on the drone feed, now in a side office, away from the main torrent. He
fought through the foam, disarming a startled guard with a quick jab to
the throat, twisting a wrist until a scream was choked off by the suds.
He moved with a brutal efficiency he hadn't known he still possessed.

He burst into the small, water-soaked office. Shobha was there, tied to
a chair, her eyes wide with terror, but alive. He reached her, his hands
fumbling with the ropes.

\""Ravi! Oh my God!\""

Just as the last knot came loose, a hulking shadow filled the doorway.
Vladimir. He stood silhouetted against the swirling foam, his eyes
burning with fury. \""The rat,\"" he snarled, a thick accent coating his
words. \""You just sealed your own fate.\""

He lunged. Ravi, exhausted and still dizzy from the adrenaline dump, met
him. It wasn't a fight; it was a brutal, one-sided beating. Vladimir was
bigger, stronger, trained in a different kind of violence. Ravi ducked,
parried, landed a desperate punch to the gut that barely registered. A
brutal hook to the jaw sent him sprawling, his head hitting the wet
concrete with a sickening crack.

His vision blurred. He tasted blood. Vladimir advanced, a menacing smile
on his face, enjoying the hunt. Ravi scrambled, desperate, his hand
going to his waistband. The small pistol. He fumbled it, his fingers
slick with foam and blood. It slipped from his grasp, skittering across
the wet floor, coming to rest just inches from Shobha's outstretched
hand.

Vladimir raised his boot, ready to stomp.

But then, a sharp, clean crack echoed through the foam-filled warehouse.
Not the raw, untrained report Ravi remembered from that Mumbai alley.
This was precise. Confident.

Vladimir gasped, a choked gurgle, and stumbled back. A dark bloom spread
across his chest, just above his heart. His eyes widened in disbelief,
then glazed over. He crashed to the ground, a heavy thud silenced by the
rushing water.

Ravi, pushing himself up on one elbow, stared. Shobha stood there, the
small .22 pistol clutched in both hands, still pointed at Vladimir's
unmoving body. Her face was pale, streaked with foam, but her eyes, wide
and resolute, held a terrifying, newfound strength. She had saved him.

The silent promise of the Silicon Valley night, the dread that had clung
to Ravi, had finally caught up. But it had awakened something in Shobha
too.

\*\*\*

The dawn that broke over the Central Valley was not just a new day; it
was a new world for Ravi and Shobha. In the quiet, rented cabin near
Yosemite, far from the lingering smell of foam and blood, their bond had
solidified into something steel-hard and unshakeable. The casual
tenderness of their early years had been replaced by a fierce, wordless
understanding, a shared knowledge of the depths they had faced and the
darkness they had overcome. Shobha, who had never conceived of violence
beyond a movie screen, looked at Ravi not just with love, but with a
new, profound respect, a silent acknowledgment of the primal force that
had saved her, and the terrifying capacity within herself that had
answered in kind. The .22 caliber pistol, now cleaned and discreetly
packed, was a silent testament to their shared awakening.

The fallout from Ravi's dead man's switch was swift and devastating. The
link to the encrypted data, once it hit Hacker News, spread like
wildfire across the internet, picked up by crypto journalists, then
mainstream financial media. The SEC and DoJ launched immediate,
aggressive investigations into AetherLend. Chopra and several other key
executives were indicted within weeks, their once-unblemished
reputations dissolving into mugshots and scathing headlines. Suleman,
however, proved more elusive. His vast network of shell companies and
private jets ensured he was always a step ahead of international
warrants, disappearing into the labyrinthine global underworld of the
ultra-rich. He became a ghost, albeit one still whispered about in the
highest echelons of venture capital.

Despite the scandal, AetherLend, in a strange testament to its
underlying technological innovation, did not die. The protocol, with its
deeply embedded, financially heavy customers, was too valuable to simply
collapse. Under immense regulatory pressure, a consortium of major
crypto players stepped in, acquired the tainted assets, and initiated a
rigorous, public audit of the entire smart contract codebase. Every line
was scrutinized, every vulnerability patched, every malicious hook
supposedly excised. The protocol was relaunched, rebranded, and
presented to the world as a new beacon of transparency and security in
the Wild West of DeFi. Millions of dollars continued to flow through its
digital arteries, now ostensibly clean, audited, and beyond reproach.

Ravi, having emerged from the shadows of his undocumented past to become
a reluctant hero, technically. He and Shobha, now truly free, considered
their future, the possibilities vast and open before them. But as Ravi
sometimes stared at the ceiling late at night, the hum of Silicon Valley
a distant counterpoint to the quiet thrum of his own mind, a small,
knowing smile would play on his lips. *Trust in the system we've built,*
Chopra's words echoed, a phantom in the night. The irony was a bitter
taste. The world thought AetherLend was secure, rebuilt on a foundation
of honesty and rigorous audits. They had scrubbed the protocol clean,
patching every known vulnerability, dissecting every line of code. They
hadn't found it. Because the true ghost in the machine wasn't a
re-entrancy bug, but a single, infinitesimally small, yet perfectly
placed, piece of *his own* code. A backdoor so subtle, so interwoven
into the core cryptographic functions, that it would register as nothing
more than harmless entropy to even the most thorough review. It wasn't
designed for theft. Not anymore. It was designed for oversight. For
leverage. A silent, untraceable presence. Just in case.

\""Ravi?\"" Shobha's voice, warm and clear, drifted from the kitchen.
\""Dinner's ready! And you promised me a night with no screens!\""

He smiled, a genuine, private smile. The world thought AetherLend was
secure. Ravi knew it was still, ultimately, *his*. And he knew, with a
certainty deeper than any code, that he would always keep watch. After
all, trust was a fragile thing. And sometimes, it needed a little\...

1li4f64,https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/1li4f64/why_do_i_get_so_freaked_out_by_embarrassing/,Why do I get so freaked out by embarrassing situations?,"Whenever someone starts getting upset (sad, angry, etc), my instinct is to run away. If I see someone doing something that's clearly going to get them in trouble, whether that be a teacher or friend, I'm practically running in the other direction to pretend nothing happened. If I'm watching or reading something and there's some kind of betrayal revealed, awkward situation, people not getting along or getting in trouble, someone doing something weird in public, I'm covering my ears and making noise to drown out whatever is going on if I'm watching with someone, or just skip the scene and figure out what happened through context clues later if I'm watching/reading alone. Even if it's something small like someone spilling coffee on someone else, I'm panicked.

Basically, I avoid any and all emotional confrontations (both fictional and real) that can result in some kind of rejection or humiliation, usually by covering my ears/putting on music, going on my phone, and trying desperately to ignore it. I didn't always do this, but it definitely started in my childhood. I can't find anyone experiencing the same thing anywhere. Is there a psychological term or reason for it?",4,1750642784.0,answers,7,0.75,False

i went in today and saw two girls behind the counter so i asked them if he was married and they were really excited and said he was single but really shy. one of the girls gave me their number and pointed out his older brother behind me and said they could go ask him if he was looking for a wife and such. i said i didn’t want to impose or anything but they insisted and went to talk to him. after they spoke with him he was also excited and i formally met him. he asked for my name age etc and told me that the guy i was interested in was a very good muslim and had a good heart, and he was going to talk to him about me. i’ve never ever done anything like this before. 

i’m still texting the girl and she told me HIS MOM came to the cafe after i left and talked to the brother again. i’m so scared i messed up or something isnt right, i know she keeps telling me everyone’s excited and i have a chance but i dont want to get my hopes up. when i came home to tell my mom about what happened she said what i did was wrong and i shouldn’t go back there again after what i did, and i should wait for him to ask for my mother’s phone number through the girl i am texting. please offer advice on what to do from here, i don’t know if what i did was right or wrong. his family seems excited but my mom thinks i was being trashy. i didn’t have the intention for everything to happen the way it did, i did duaa before going in and all i intended was to get a coffee and ask a female worker if he was married just like comments in the previous post said. 

did i really do something wrong?? what do i do from here? am i really being trashy should i just give up? please help :(

1li4efd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1li4efd/moths_or_butterflies/,Moths or Butterflies?,"4:40 AM. I woke earlier than usual to get ready for work. The house was quiet except for the soft clinking of my father’s coffee cup outside—the kitchen is outdoors, as it often is in the mountains. 

Suddenly, I heard my mother murmuring from their room, caught in a nightmare. I quickly went to her and gently woke her up. Her mumbling stopped, and I stayed with her for a moment to make sure she was fully awake. After that, I returned to the living room. 

As I looked around, I noticed something—at first just one delicate flutter. Then another. Then more, until there were at least ten. At first, I thought they were butterflies. Maybe they were. 

Goosebumps spread across my skin. I called Papa outside to come and see. Curious, I asked him if anything like this had ever happened before. He paused and said no; it was unusual. 

I told him about Mama’s nightmare. He went to check on her. Soon, my mother came out and shared the dream—a disturbing vision about my aunt abroad, who appeared pregnant. My mother asked how many months along she was, but the details escaped me. What stuck with my mother was that my aunt’s fingers began decaying, as if she were already dead. That image shook her deeply, explaining the mumbling I had heard. I didn’t have time to ask more questions then—I needed to prepare for work—but I plan to ask her later. 

I stepped outside to prepare my bath. The CR—the outdoor restroom, as is common in the mountains—is separate from the house. I heard the fluttering wings again and caught sight of a yellow wing trying to get inside.  

This part terrified me. Immediately, I thought an engkanto—a spirit or supernatural being in Filipino folklore—was trying to communicate. I don’t know why I thought that at the moment. Silly, maybe. As someone who doesn’t easily believe in the paranormal or traditional signs, I tried to reason it out: maybe they were just attracted to the light I had just turned on. But then again, we have outdoor lights too—why weren’t they drawn to those? 

After my bath, when I went back inside, only four remained. The windows were closed, and I wondered if they had slipped through the small space near the roof. It was strange—almost as if this wasn’t just a coincidence but a quiet sign that something was shifting inside me too. 

Unable to resist, I searched right then and there: What does it mean when butterflies come to you? 

A few things popped up if they were indeed butterflies: 

Butterflies are often seen as symbols of transformation, rebirth, and new beginnings. In many cultures, they’re also believed to carry messages from the spirit world, sometimes from loved ones who have passed. 

And maybe that’s what this was—a message. 

🤍 That I’m in the process of becoming. 

🤍 That healing is happening, even if it’s quiet. 

🤍 That I’m not as alone as I feel. 

🤍 That change is here, slow but steady. 

And then, just as my father and I were ready to ride the motorcycle—something he usually do in the morning since he sends me off on the bus—a bee suddenly tried to sting me. It caught me off guard, and I couldn’t help but wonder: Why me? Why today? 

Between the butterflies, the fluttering wings, and now the bee, it feels like the day is full of messages—about change, protection, or awakening. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m starting to feel like I’m right in the middle of something bigger than myself. 

I’ve been trying to heal. The breakup left me raw, and therapy is helping me sort through grief and confusion, and the parts of myself I lost along the way. But this morning it felt different. Like my soul was whispering: You’re still here. You’re still becoming.  

I don’t know exactly what those butterflies meant. Maybe they weren’t outside of me at all. Maybe they are me—a quiet sign that healing is happening, even when I can’t see it. ",2,1750642714.0,SpiritualAwakening,1,1.0,False

1li4a1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftRecommendations/comments/1li4a1m/how_to_choose_the_perfect_gift_for_the_hardest/,How to Choose the Perfect Gift for the Hardest People to Shop For,"Don't you think gift shopping becomes very challenging whether it's a  birthday, holiday, wedding, or graduation when you're trying to find that ""perfect gift"". We often end up Googling

“gift ideas for someone who has everything” 

You have already seen here:  
🧔‍♂️ “What do I get my dad who buys himself everything he wants?”  
♻️ ""My mom is trying to go plastic-free, what’s a good gift that fits her lifestyle but still feels special?""  
🛋️ *""*My best friend is basically a professional couch potato—lives in PJs and binge-watches everything. What would be the perfect gift for him?""

So here’s a guide to improve your gift-giving approach with real strategies and not just another product list:

**1: Think About the Person, Not the Product :** Before gifting anything, ask yourself :

* What do they *enjoy* doing in their free time?
* Have they mentioned anything they *need*, even casually?
* What’s something they’d never buy for themselves, but would love to own?

If they already have a hobby, look for ways to upgrade or support it. A home cook? Try a high-quality spice set. A runner? A massage gun or performance socks.

 **2: Pick a Gift Category that matches their personality** 

|Type|Best For|Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Useful**|Practical folks|Travel adapter, Kindle, smart mug|
|**Personalized**|Sentimental givers|Custom illustration, engraved wallet|
|**Experiential**|Minimalists or adventurers|Concert tickets, Airbnb gift card|
|**Funny/quirky**|Close friends or siblings|Meme T-shirts, desk toys|
|**Luxury treats**|Spoiling someone|Silk pajamas, high-end candles, Jewllery, Branded Stuff|

**3: Add a Personal Touch** Even a basic gift becomes memorable with a thoughtful note or a personal story. 

📝 “Got this because you once said your coffee gets cold before meetings. Hope this fixes that!”

Imagine receiving a gift with this kind of message—you’d feel seen and appreciated. Those little moments matter more than we realize.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid🚫**

* **Buying something generic**: If it feels like a re-gift, it probably looks like one too.
* **Being overly practical**: Toothbrushes, socks, or planners can work but only if they feel personalized or high-quality.
* **Overspending too early**: Especially in new relationships or with acquaintances. Always set financial and emotional boundaries.

Top ideas that always work:

* **Niche hobbies**: “My cousin’s into vintage cameras—any rare film stocks or cool straps you’d recommend as a gift?”
* **Life events**: “Just got married/moved/had a baby—what helped *you* during that time, Maybe I can gift the same thing if it fits their situation?”
* **Crowd-sourced wins**: “What’s one gift you received that blew your mind, Could be a great clue if the person I’m buying for has similar taste.”

If you're still confused, just ask! This community will help you find creative and thoughtful ideas for every budget and personality.

**Final Thought 💭**

A good gift doesn’t have to be expensive or trendy—it just needs to show that you’ve paid attention. Even a small, thoughtful gift can go a long way.

1li48c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1li48c6/showcase_peekaping_a_gopowered_stronglytyped/,"Showcase: Peekaping – a Go-powered, strongly-typed uptime & ping monitor you can self-host in < 30 sec","Hey folks! 👋 Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. After yet another bout of DB corruption and a sluggish UI in Uptime Kuma, I decided to start fresh and build the monitor I wanted to run. The result is **Peekaping**—a Go-powered, TypeScript-typed, plugin-friendly uptime monitor that’s easy to hack on and easy to trust.

⸻

**Why another monitor?**

* Stability first – Go backend + Mongo 
* Strong typing end-to-end – TypeScript front & a strictly typed plugin API. 
* Hackability – everything exposed via REST + Swagger; live updates over WebSockets
* Easy extensible and well structured 

⸻

**Features at a glance**

* HTTP/HTTPS & Push monitors (more coming) Smart notifications: Email, Slack, Telegram, Webhooks – retry logic & “notify-on-change”
* Live dashboard: WebSocket charts, 24-h uptime line, response-time histogram
* Public status pages (dark-mode ready)
* Maintenance windows & data-retention cleanup
* Docker-first: multi-arch images (amd64, arm64, armv7)

⸻

**30-second quick-start**

    # 1. Grab defaults
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xfurai/peekaping/main/.env.example         -o .env
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xfurai/peekaping/main/docker-compose.prod.yml -o docker-compose.yml
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xfurai/peekaping/main/nginx.conf           -o nginx.conf
    
    # 2. Fire it up
    docker compose up -d
    
    # 3. Visit the UI
    open http://localhost:8383

⸻

**Road-map**

1. Add more notification channels (Discord, Matrix, PagerDuty)
2. Add more monitor types (TCP port, ICMP, DNS, certificate expiry)
3. Team management system (invite users, roles, activity log)

⸻

**Call for testers & contributors**

Peekaping is MIT-licensed and still young. I’d love feedback from the r/selfhosted crowd:

* Spin it up, point a few checks at your infra, and see if it keeps up.
* File bugs/feature requests, or jump into code – a new notifier is \~50 LoC.
* Docs, UI tweaks, benchmarks… every contribution helps!
* Drop a star if you like it ❤️

**P.S**  
Peekaping is my first open-source project. It’s the product of many late evenings, weekend mornings, and too much coffee. I know it’s not perfect—that’s why I’m turning to the community that’s taught me so much. Your ideas and critiques will shape where Peekaping goes next, and I can’t wait to build it with you.

Your feedback will shape where Peekaping goes next—and I’m excited to build it together. 💛

1li485t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1li485t/given_a_bookstore_gift_card_can_you_recommend/,Given a bookstore gift card. Can you recommend some titles that aren’t one time reads?,"My in-laws give me gift cards a few times a year and I so appreciate it. I got bookcases this year after a long time of wanting some, so they gave me bookstore gift cards to add to them. Normally I’d use them towards textbooks but now I’ve graduated (yay!) 

I have a fair number of books already including physical copies of favorites I re-read from time to time. don’t know what new-to-me titles I’d buy that I’d read or refer to multiple times and just getting coffee with it feels wasteful. I don’t need any journals, pens, etc. 

I think I am mainly looking for nonfiction titles that are useful references that don’t go out of date quickly. 

I have my mother’s family cookbook and a few others, so not much in that regard. Just to give some examples, I have a book on the etymology of words, a dictionary, a few foreign language learning books, a book for gardening in my climate, a couple of hobby-related reference books, a poisoner’s guide for writers, and one on the meanings of common symbols.

1li477x,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1li477x/overheard_something_today_that_made_me_cry/,Overheard something today that made me cry,"I was walking down the street to get coffee today when I overheard something that moved me to tears.  Now, my town is very diverse. We have rainbow crosswalks downtown, and currently have Pride banners up for June. A mom, dad, and their young child were walking past me and I heard the kid ask about all of the rainbows. The mom said to him, “The rainbows are for Pride Month. Pride is about celebrating love and that people can love whoever they want. And that people should be loved for who they are.” 

I know it’s something so simple, and I know I live somewhere where I’m welcome. But amidst so much of the hate and backlash and general unease in today’s discourse, it really touched me to hear a parent - a presumably straight one - explain not just Pride but acceptance to a young child in such a succinct and understandable way that a kid can understand. I wanted to double back and thank them, but didn’t want to be weird. I hope the universe rewards them for their kindness. 

A friendly reminder that there are good people out there raising their little ones to be accepting. Kids can handle it. Kids can handle us. Hate is the unnatural thing they need to be taught. ",77,1750642081.0,LesbianActually,6,1.0,False

1li43e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1li43e7/cystic_metastatic_lymph_node_vs_second_branchial/,Cystic Metastatic Lymph Node vs Second Branchial Cleft Cyst. What is the correct path to diagnosis?,"42F. Cystic metastatic lymph node vs second branchial cleft cyst in level 2A neck region. Mass cannot be removed until neurosurgeons determine if VP shunt revision is needed. 
(Shunt placed in 2019 for IIH w/ Papilledema. It has been over-draining & caused collapsed ventricles for 2+ yrs. Recent hospitalization for sudden onset aphasia, hemifacial spasms, myoclonic or choreiform dyskinetic movements, low grade fever, high blood pressure & high heart rate for 15 days set this whole discovery of the neck mass in motion. It was seen on an MRV in 2019, along w/ transverse sinus stenosis, but was never reported as a finding or told to me).

After the MRI in the hospital reported finding a neck mass, I had a CT scan with contrast done, after which I was sent to see an ENT. The ENT did not take medical history, ask questions, or perform an exam. Based on CT scan report he determined it’s a second branchial cleft cyst & sent me for an ultrasound of my thyroid to r/o any involvement. Ultrasound showed thyroid nodule TIRAD 5 (7+), & that neck mass had grown, & did not show characteristics of being a simple cyst. Biopsy of neck mass was done (did not perform one on thyroid nodule) & the report came back showing squamous epithelial cells, & that sample was limited/markedly degenerated & contained primarily degenerated/anuclear cells w/ acellular debris. Recommended tissue sample & correlation w/ radiology findings. Thyroid tests show my TSH dropped from 2.14 uIU/ml to .43 uIU/ml between March 26th and May 1st. T4 Free was 0.9 ng/dl, T3 was 121 ng/dl, Thyroglobulin tumor marker was 22 ng/ml, TgAB <1.8, TPO AB <28.

I feel like I’m dealing w/ a doctor’s confirmation bias, & that even if this is a SBCC, that he isn’t ruling out any of the other possibilities, which puts me at risk. I smoked 1-2 packs a day for 19 years, had HPV w/ CIN 2 cervical dysplasia at the age of 19, had EBV at 15, I have an enlarged tonsil on the same side as the neck mass that stays enlarged, but also gets larger off and on while the other one stays the same size. I feel like these things (and now the thyroid nodule) are enough to warrant the ENT doing at least some investigation into whether or not there could be cancer.

3/26 MRI:
Lesion in the right upper neck which is partially included in the field-of-view measuring up to 2.1 x 1.4 cm. It appears that there was a lesion at this location on the MRV from 2019, in retrospect. Further evaluation with CT of the neck soft tissues with contrast is recommended on a nonemergent basis followed by outpatient ENT consultation. EXTRACRANIAL SOFT TISSUES: There is a mildly T2 FLAIR hyperintense lesion in the right upper neck just inferior to the parotid gland and posterior to the mandible which is only partially included in the field-of-view. The included portion of the lesion measures 2.1 x 1.4 cm. There appears to be a circumscribed lesion at this location on the prior MRV from April 2019 in retrospect.

5/1 CT w contrast:
Impression
Predominantly cystic lesion in the right level 2 nodal region measuring 4.3 cm in maximal dimension with a small soft tissue density component along the anteromedial margin measuring 4 mm in thickness corresponds to the lesion seen on the MRI brain from March 26, 2025. While this could represent a second branchial cleft cyst given the location, the thin soft tissue component along the anteromedial margin is atypical for branchial cleft cyst. Given this finding along with patient's age, the differential should include a cystic metastatic lymph node. ENT referral for further evaluation of potential tissue sampling/lesion resection is recommended.  No abnormalities identified along the aerodigestive tract.

LYMPH NODES: In the right level 2A nodal region, corresponding to the finding on recent MRI, there is an ovoid predominantly cystic lesion measuring approximately 2.7 x 1.8 x 4.3 cm (image 152, series 201; image 82, series 205). There appears to be a small soft tissue component along the anteromedial margin of this cystic lesion (image 151, series 201) measuring approximately 4 mm in thickness.  THYROID: Normal.

5/23 Ultrasound:
Impression
1. A single TR 5-highly suspicious nodule is identified within the midpole of the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Given size of this nodule, according to TI-RADS recommendations, yearly follow-up is recommended. 2. At the location of palpable concern, within the right level 2A region, there is a hypoechoic mass which measures 4.5 x 1.6 x 3.0 cm. This does not have the imaging characteristics consistent with that of a simple cyst. Recommendation is for biopsy.   
FINDINGS:  Homogeneous echotexture and smooth contour of both thyroid lobes.  Right thyroid lobe measures 4.4 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm. A single thyroid nodule is identified.  Nodule A Location: Midpole Size: 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm Composition: Solid (2)  Echogenicity: Hypoechoic (2) Taller than wide: No (0) Margins: Smooth (0) Echogenic foci: Punctate (3) Total points: 7+ (TR5- Highly suspicious)  Left thyroid lobe measures 4.2 x 1.4 x 1.6 cm. No discrete nodule identified.  Isthmus measures 0.2 cm in thickness.  Within the right level 2A regions (at the location of palpable concern, there is a hypoechoic mass which measures 4.5 x 1.6 x 3.0 cm. No internal vascularity is identified. This structure does not demonstrate posterior acoustic enhancement. Adjacent to the structure, there is a normal-appearing lymph node.

Diagnosis Comment
Cytology specimen and cell block composed of squamous epithelial cells, predominantly degenerated/anucleated, and acellular debris. The differential diagnosis is broad and may include nonneoplastic lesions (epidermoid cyst, branchial cleft cyst) as well as neoplastic processes with squamous differentiation.  Although no definitive atypia is seen in the material examined, the specimen is limited/markedly degenerated and follow-up with tissue biopsy suggested as clinically indicated.   Clinical radiologic correlation is essential. 

Gross Description
A.
30 cc's of cloudy yellow fluid received fixed in cytolyt. Centrifuge concentrated sample processed using selective cellular enhancement technique. 

I’m confused about the tech saying the sample was cloudy yellow fluid when the stuff that came out was a creamy brown. It looked like coffee that had creamer added to it.

Thyroglobulin, FNAB Needle Wash Thyroglobulin, FNAB, Lymph Node Not Reported Thyroglobulin, FNAB, Non Lymph Node <0.1 ng/mL  Thyroglobulin, FNAB, Interpretation SEE NOTE Reference intervals for thyroglobulin (Tg) in needle wash specimens other than lymph nodes have not been established. However, unless there has been a sampling error, the undetectable Tg concentration is consistent with absence of follicular-thyrocyte derived tissue at the site biopsied. Correlation of this result with imaging and cytology is recommended. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION------------------- This test has been modified from the manufacturer's instructions.

I guess what I really want to know is this: Am I being ridiculous for wanting a second opinion? If you were my doctor are you thinking it’s a second branchial cleft cyst, or moving ahead eliminating any cancer possibilities? If my thyroid nodule is too small to biopsy, is a thyroid scan a reasonable request? Is a PETCT a reasonable request to find out if the neck mass (and Thyroid nodule, which would eliminate need for thyroid scan) is malignant rather than wait for multiple surgeries to send it to pathology? The mass is big enough that it’s causing discomfort and pushing into my throat especially when I tilt my head down to the right, as well as pressing on blood vessels. Imaging is showing consistent growth, and it’s now noticeable by touch and sight, and it wasn’t 2-3 months ago.

*Solving one mystery from* **Control-Alt-Delete**, *and deepening others.*  
  
**Priority 000 Alert**  
**Unknown enemy engaged**  
**UNS Europe**

The captain sat in his quarters, frowning at the reply to his alert. It would take another week for other ships to arrive. 

Meanwhile, they were all there was. Carefully, he took another sip of his coffee. As if it could burn him still, after hours of neglect. 

There had been several fights between crew members. Nothing serious, but tension had reached a breaking point. His officers no longer trusted their own judgment and consulted him on every decision.

Double watches should keep them occupied, the captain concluded.

They held watch. Every anomaly was viewed as a threat. Tension kept rising, something had to give at some point. As the captain pondered the situation, he heard loud noises. He quickened his step to find the source. It came from the mess hall.

Singing?

When he heard the words ""Happy birthday,"" he remembered: his first officer’s anniversary. 

Upon entering, his eyes were drawn to the ceiling. 

The riddle of the first officer’s underwear had finally been solved.

They hung in tidy rows on a string, serving as decoration for the not-so-happy-looking chap. A pink thong, no one knew how it got on board, completed the scene. 

For a second, the room grew quiet. Then the captain, with a faint smile and looking up, said:

“Carry on.”

On the way back to the bridge, he looked at them. 

It was no longer a training mission.

A few still clung to their juvenile outlook, but most had aged years in days. Their eyes no longer held the youthful confidence of teenage immortality.

Jimmy, one of the gunners, had stopped stuttering. Anxiety had returned to a bearable level and that only at the cost of a moody first officer.

The captain had no time to think about home. Or the distant galaxy. Days had passed since the unknown attack. The aftermath still took all his attention. 

The dryer had broken down. Or more precisely: it had been cannibalized to repair an overheated point defense. Laundry now hung in every corridor, making the air damp and faintly smell of flowers.

A good change, the captain thought, ducking under a shirt as he stepped into engineering.

He looked around.

Pipes, engines, and control panels filled the room with little regard for humans. A great training vessel. 

He saw it differently now.

Duct-tape bandages wrapped the leaking pipes. The life support system whined. Some panels were dark. The ship was tired. More tired than he’d let himself admit. And more work than they could manage in a real engagement.

One of the crew grabbed a soda from the improvised dispenser wedged between the FTL’s cooling pipes. It hissed open with the sound of guilty pleasure.

The captain watched, then turned away.

It would have to do.

He was rudely awakened again later that night. The contact alarm sounded. Fifth time already. Another return, from what was technically beyond the range of their sensors, only to disappear again right after.

Most likely the old sensor array glitching.

But maybe… something was stirring in the depths.

The crew had to remain on double watch.

Another secret weapon needed to be deployed to maintain morale. The captain decided to let the first officer handle it. He would be the hero of the day and let him regain some authority.

A few hours later, the captain checked in on the mess hall. The first officer looked much happier now. He was standing behind a beer tap, distributing glasses.

The crew applauded when a perfect foam-capped beer was handed to the captain. He politely refused: “a captain is always on duty.”

\---

The crew had not trained for it. The manoeuvre was considered too desperate. Yet they had no choice now.

Some stumbled, others gazed. The transition from endless vigilance to sudden action was too sudden for many. Yet the captain was already at his post. 

Ten dreadnaughts had streaked through subspace in their direction. The faint and distant echoes now confirmed as the goliaths loomed on the sensors.

""Full dark. Heading E-3, zero,"" he barked. The captain then coughed.

The first officer looked at him for a moment. The heading would place them exactly in the path of the dreadnaught marked as E-3.

""Full dark."" ""Heading E-3, zero, Aye aye sir!""the first officer repeated with a firm voice.

\--

“It was an exercise in butt-clenching,” the gunnery officer later admitted. There had been no briefing. No plan had been discussed. 

Still they had done it. With the short tense commands of the captain, the reflexes of their young pilot and hard work from everyone able to hold a wrench they now were at mere hundreds of meters away from the giant ship.

It had been just in time as the space behind them turned first into one and then many novas as starsized explosions engulfed them with harsh radiation. Shields down 30%. 

The captain had just nodded. The expected reaction to them going dark.  Now they drifted silently, only the training dummies left. 

They were too close  to see the enemy dreadnought entirely. Its cannons were longer than the UNS Europe herself. They could see into one of the gaping maws. 

The cadets whispered first, eyes wide.

Some couldn’t believe they were this near and still alive. That they couldn’t be heard. 

A medic had dropped his lunch tray, richly stacked with foods and drinks that clattered over the floor. All heads turned. But the ship didn’t react.

Their cloak, experimental and never field tested, was holding. The stealth field blotted them out from sensors, light, and even gravity signatures.

After a while, the dreadnought stopped being terrifying. The close view made it lose dimension and soon it was not much more than a wall-poster.

“An endless alien city,” the doctor remarked. She always spoke softly. 

“You can speak up now, they won’t hear you.” The marine smiled at his own joke.

The doctor stood there for a moment, then shouted “Booh!” at the window. The marine flinched. Smiling, the doctor took a seat and started her lunch. On other tables conversations continued. 

“It looks so ancient, it makes this boat look new.”

The first jokes were met with nervous laughs. Soon the mood changed.

“Damn,” an ensign cursed softly. “I never thought to see anything that beats *your mam*a.”

“We should spray paint on it,” a cadet suggested. 

“Gimme a minute, I am running a simulation of docking with these…” the pilot pointed at the window. 

The captain sat in a corner, listening and thinking. The dreadnoughts were unfamiliar. Unclassified. But they had railguns. Missiles. Standard weapons. Just parallel development? Or an old curse returning from the void?

He searched the old logs on his tablet, but found nothing. Not everything had been recorded in the Age of War. Not all history had survived. There were holes. Big ones. The captain wondered which hole these dreadnoughts had come crawling from.

He had to know.

He rose. A moment later, he joined his first officer on the bridge.

“Assemble a recon mission,” he said.

“Stealth suits. Scatter-burst communications only.”

That meant a minutes-long lag between each message. And a near-zero chance of tracking them through the data stream.

It also meant they were basically on their own.",43,1750641741.0,HFY,5,0.99,False
