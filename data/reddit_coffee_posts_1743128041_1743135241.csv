1jlmn2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1jlmn2y/info_you_probably_wont_find_elsewhere_how_i/,Info you probably won't find elsewhere - How I finally got huge and ripped at 55,"I find this interesting but I'll keep it as short as possible.  I describe the ONLY routine that ever worked for me and I was 55 y/o.  In one year I got so muscular and ripped I was thinking about going into maintenance mode.

At 32 y/o I was on testosterone cream and worked out 4 days per week: Monday/Thursday was Chest/Tri/shoulder and Tue/Fri was Back/bi/leg.  Abs each workout.  (three sets each muscle doing around 12/10/8 sets)

I was a vegetarian and only eating 40 grams of protein (soy burgers) per day and (for some reason handfulls of mini reeses peanut butter cups.)  Virtually no other carbs like bread, etc.

I worked out for a year w/o missing a workout and hardly saw any gains.  In fact, I thought to myself, if I got gains like this in three months, I STILL would never work out again.  I didn't work out again for about 15 years.

I started up a few more times and then gave up for lack of gains.

Then covid came around.  I was 55 y/o and chubby (I'm 5'6 and was 165) and had very little muscularity.  I decided to commit FULLY.  After ten months I got ripped at 155lb and 11% body fat and was HUGE.  Friends and even strangers were complimenting me.  I was embarrassed to take off my shirt at the pool because I felt like a douche for 'showing off.'

I was on the SAME amount of testosterone that I was taking at 32 y/o so I don't believe testosterone was the reason I succeeded but maybe it was that and the combo I was doing.

Here's what I did:

No longer a vegetarian.

Went to the gym EVERY day for a ten months straight.

Testosterone cream (same amount as always - my doc watched me like a hawk and my level was always around 600-900 since I was 32)

Large black cold brew coffee in the morning.

Worked out fasted.

Same workout as when I was 32 (see above) although this time NEVER writing down my weights.  When I could get 13 reps on the first set, the next time I would increase the weight.  So I was always going to failure or w/in 1 rep, anyway.

Drink after working out: About 60 grams of protein powder, creatine, green tea, psyllium husk, apple cider vinegar, salt, electrolytes.  (as organic as possible)

Also after working out: Half an apple and a rice cake. (Organic)

After working out: 25 minute sauna

Ate about 1 hour after the sauna: Hamburger patty (no bun) and steamed veg.  Or Eggs and riced cauliflower in butter.  Meals like this - high in protein, virtually no carbs.  THEN I'd have another protein drink but w/o the green tea (too much caffeine).  Maybe I'd have a snack of 4 eggs scrambled in butter, maybe not.

Stopped eating around 5:30pm (Started eating around 1-2pm)

THEN every day I wasn't lifting weights I'd do the same routine above but also do ten 10 second sprints and 3 sets of leg lifts for abs and 3 sets of ab pulldowns.

SO...what was the difference between age 32 and 55?  To me it was diet and intensity.  

I remember saying to myself, ""Now that I have the body I always dreamed of, watch...I'll probably die.""  and I almost did.  I got covid and spent 2 months in the hospital.  My lung collapsed three times.  I was hallucinating so badly they put me on medication for schizophrenia.  I lost ALL of my muscle.  I didn't look like I had ever lifted in my life when I left the hospital.

That was almost 4 years ago and although I got back almost all my muscle I don't look the same and I have yet to be able to get ripped again.  I wondered why and it's probably because I'm lacking that intensity from before.  I feel like everything else is the same but maybe I'm not eating the same way and I'm not sprinting anymore becasue my lungs can't seem to take it.  Also, unlike that 10 months before I got covid it took me YEARS to get back my muscle.

ANYWAY...I wanted to share this because it's a real world experiment...at 55 I was on the same testosterone level as from 32 y/o.  Virtually same lifting routine (but now going to failure).  Hitting the gym every single day instead of 4 days/week.  Adding LOTS more protein.  Increasing the intensity.  Doing the saunas and protein drinks.  Eating in a shortened window.  Working out fasted.

I hope this helps someone.

The History and Popularity of Butter Pecan Ice Cream in American Cuisine
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Butter Pecan ice cream stands out as one of America‚Äôs favorite frozen treats, known for its rich flavor and crunchy texture. This delicious dessert has a charming history that dates back to the early days of ice cream itself. Its combination of smooth cream, nuttiness from pecans, and buttery sweetness makes it a delightful indulgence, but how did it rise to prominence in American cuisine?

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
The origins of Butter Pecan ice cream can be traced to the Southern United States. Pecan trees are native to this region, where they thrive in the warm climate. Early American settlers recognized the appeal of this nut and began to incorporate it into various recipes. The blending of pecans with sweet creams and sugars likely occurred in the homes of these settlers, paving the way for this unique flavor.

During the late 19th century, ice cream became a popular dessert across the nation. The introduction of commercial ice cream production allowed for flavors like butter pecan to reach wider audiences. Butter Pecan was first listed among flavors in the early 1900s, indicating its growing popularity. As more families gained access to ice cream, the unique southern flavor was embraced in kitchens from coast to coast.

The creamy texture of Butter Pecan comes from the use of brown sugar, which not only sweetens the mixture but also adds a depth of flavor. Traditional recipes also include roasted pecans, which are essential for that characteristic crunch. The process of roasting the nuts enhances their flavor, making each spoonful a delightful mixture of creaminess and nuttiness.

By the mid-20th century, Butter Pecan was firmly established as a staple in ice cream parlors and stores. The combination of its sweet and salty notes appealed to many.

Many ice cream brands began to showcase this flavor prominently, securing its position among classic flavors like vanilla and chocolate.

1jlmlr6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jlmlr6,Nobody's Nobody Review,"
VERY long post incoming haha.
I posted my haul months ago and people wanted me to post my thoughts on these which I meant to do AGES ago but holidays + ADHD + life means only getting to it now üò¨
On the plus side, being 5 months later it means I have definitely given these all a good use and time to work.

About me: mid 30's - combination skin but no particular sensitivities to ingredients/fragrances or any specific skin issues wanting to address.

Face Wash:
Gel cleanser with a mild amount of lather/foam. Very light scent of something that I can't quite name but wasn't overly strong smelling.
Was using it both morning and night (yes yes, I know you don't need to do morning but I am a person that can't not).
Found it a bit too drying using twice a day so switched to it being my evening cleanse and using a gentle/milky cleanser for my AM and has been so much better.
Does contain niacinamide and some fruit/herbal extracts for those that have sensitivities.
Rating - 3/5 - can take it or leave it. $16 full price means I prob wouldn't get it if it wasn't on sale, but Woolies often does have these discounted so maybe?

Leave-On Exfoliant:
Haven't used Paula's Choice to be able to compare, but I did quite like using this one. I only used it once a week and I think it has made a difference for me :)
Rating - 4/5 - would definitely repurchase :)

Vitamin C Serum:
Only previous experience with Vit C is the Ordinary (30% suspension in silicone) and that one was not great haha.
This was miles better, not that it's a high bar to beat but I did like this one. Came in bottle with pump, rather than using a dropper. I noticed that the colour didn't change at all in the time it took to get through this and that's probably because there was less chance of oxidisation with this bottle design.
Rating - 4/5. Would probably repurchase but also might try a few other VitC products so I can find which one is best for me.

5-in-1 Serum:
Was a fan of this - used twice daily. Says it's a ""multi-tasking"" serum but that's probably just because of how many benefits you get from niacinamide, and not because of other beneficial ingredients. Has a couple of other ingredients but at very low levels and is basically just a niacinamide serum (10%). 
Rating - 3/5. Probably not repurchase just because there's plenty of other niacinamide serums and would shop around for the best one for me, probably at a lower %

Retinol Serum:
I will admit this is the first retinol I have used. Packaging says 0.25% retinol serum. I started off sparingly and only once or twice a week but I never really noticed any reaction so I went to using every weeknight (I stopped on weekends so there would be 36hrs either side of using the exfoliating toner). 
I don't know if I really saw much of a difference, but I also don't know if that is because it's a low concentration and/or the specific retinol ingredients used but I definitely didn't have any bad reactions as a first-time retinol user. Also it has this fragrance that I think? is a coffee scent? Idk what it is, and it is a nice smell, but it makes me think of a coffee shop/bakery for some reason.
Rating - 3/5. Might possibly purchase again but will probably look around and get to know more about different retinols first. Might be nice if they had this product in a couple of different strength options so I could look at this same product with a higher percentage.

Water Cream:
I LOVE this one so damn much. I haven't tried the Neutrogena Hydro that everyone seems to love (it's a brand I won't purchase personally) but this is a super light and hydrating cream that sinks in to your skin and actually makes me happy to use it (if that even makes any sense). Although I don't have any specific skin issues, I just generally don't like thick creams just due to my own thing about textures and thick creams almost making me feel claustrophobic haha. Over the years I've tried so many different moisturisers and some I've hated for their thickness/feel and some have been fine, but I've never loved using one quite like this one.
This one is also ""a little goes a long way"". I used the little spoon that came with it initially, but even just dipping it into the tub a little was too much, so I ended up using my fingers. A tiny bit covers my whole face and neck so well. 
Rating - 5000/5. Would absolutely repurchase (already have). 

Luxe Rich Cream:
As I just said - tend to hate thick creams but I got this anyway just to try and see. I also saw a couple of beauty people on tiktok say something about double moisturising, which seemed kinda weird but decided what the hell. So I used the water cream as my first moisturiser and this rich cream as a second one on top and OMG it's so good. This is rich without being ""thick"" and using it on top of the water cream means it just locks that hydration in without feeling heavy. 
Rating - 4/5 (taking a point off for packaging - see more about that below). Would definitely repurchase.

Overnight Hydration Mask:
I haven't used this a whole lot, but mostly because I'm forgetful especially at night when I'm tired.
The times that I have used it though, it definitely feels nice and isn't one of those ""drying"" masks that makes your face feel tight. Gives a nice glowy feel the next morning and rinses off well.
Rating - 3/5 (based on the few times I have used). Might repurchase but also might not, if only because I forget to use masks so it might be wasted on me.

Thoughts on packaging/other:
In general I like the packaging, however it kinda annoys me that the serums have the same aesthetic as Drunk Elephant, when I think they're good enough products on their own and don't need to look like ""dupes"".
I notice that the products that come in boxes (serums/moisturisers) don't have their ingredients listed on the product itself, only the outside packaging box, which means you need to look it up on their website if you want to check something. Not a huge issue, but just an observation.
My main gripe with their packaging is that it's really hard to tell when you're running low and are going to need to buy more.
With all 3 serums, and the luxe rich cream, is that they felt like there was plenty of product left and then all of a sudden you run out.
None of the bottles are transparent enough to see how much is left, unless you want to unscrew the pump and have a look inside.
I was also kind of annoyed that the rich cream is actually a bottle inside a bottle (see second pic) which means it feels heavy even when empty so you don't notice it getting any lighter with use.
Maybe these packaging things are just being nitpicky but it kind of annoyed me with otherwise good products.

I haven't had a chance to try any of their other products. I'm not very much of a makeup girly so didn't look at the bronzing drops/bronzing oil/blushing drops/setting spray.
I wouldn't mind trying the SPF primer or the whipped body butter, except I never seem to see them available unfortunately.",3,1743134754.0,AusSkincare,1,1.0,False

1. I have my system in my cabin hooked up to pv and grid and an rv is plugged into the 30amp outlet.  I have an electric coffeemaker like this [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFTDBF9T?ref\_=ppx\_hzsearch\_conn\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title\_1&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFTDBF9T?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) and when trying to run it off an RV plug (that is powered by the ac+b300) it doesn't function correctly- it looks like it's working but the water doesn't get perc'd over the coffee grounds.  When I plug it into a grid outlet it works fine.
2. I had to evac for Helene last year and took the system with me in my rv, and while doing that noticed that the ac300 won't charge from an rv ac plug when powered by my onboard generator- it gives a low voltage error.  At home it charges off a grid ac plug just fine.  This is a much bigger deal as I'll likely have to evac like that again and this system is much less useful to me unless I can figure out a fix.

If anyone has ideas about anything please lmk, thx!

P.S. random related question- if I'm reading manual right it looks like a solar panel can be plugged directly into the b300 battery- can that be done at the same time as I've got pv hooked up to the ac300 charging the battery, or is it just meant for if you ever use the battery standalone?

Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger.

I have been dealing with some health issues for around a year and a half now. It started out as what I think were nutritional deficiencies. I had high heart rate and exhaustion. I started iron, vit c, vit d and k, vit b and zinc. This helped me for awhile gain back mobility because I was bed bound for months. I started scaling back on my supplements because my health was back. I seen multiple doctors and everyone gaslighted me into think I was crazy when I was at the lowest point. I seen a naturopath doctor for a little bit and he was pointing towards my adrenal glands being fatigued.

I also have been diagnosed with migraines w aura. But I haven‚Äôt been taking my medicine because of some insurance switches. I feel like my diet is decently healthy and I workout usually around 4-5 times a week.

Total tmi but also mucus in my stools. I would say that my stools are pretty frequent but sometimes I deal with constipation. And I also get like a general stomach pain as well.

Case worker adds notes, but doesn't send notices??","Hello, I am wondering if this is weird or if it's new policy? Sorry it's a bit of a long post. I recertified February 12th (still pregnant at the time), and then needed to report a change once my baby was born March 2nd (also added my partner to my case as the households only source of income for the time being- no paid maternity leave/ineligible for fmla).

I uploaded all income/expenses during recertification and once the change was received and documented I received a notice to upload child's birth certificate and partners income - done. 

Something told me to call in and see if anything else was needed because I've had an issue in the past where I uploaded all requested documents and the caseworker denied me saying I didn't. Called the call center and they confirmed I did, escalated my case, and got me approved.

I called in roughly 11 days ago and was told my caseworker ""added a note"" for me to submit a loss of income form from a job I hadn't been employed at since last year (I'd submitted this loss of income during a previous recertification and the documents are still on my file, confirmed by call center employee), as well as employment verification form for my partner. I uploaded these and called a 5 days later to be told the caseworker had ""added another note"" and needed proof of loans (used a cash advance loan for personal emergency and reported it on the February recertification, BUT I'd already uploaded this proof during the recertification - also confirmed by call center employee).

In all this time I haven't received an official notice, since the one to upload child's birth certificate and partner income, and wouldn't have known these items were needed by the due date if I hadn't called in to check. Is this normal? I feel like caseworker is trying everything possible to get me to give up or something? We already didn't get benefits for this month and I'm nervous there will be more of a delay to receive benefits in April.

I feel bad to keep calling in to make sure everything is uploaded and nothing else is needed, but we don't have a decent food pantry near us (get expired foods/LOTS of bulk coffee items from McDonald‚Äôs/foods that should be kept frozen/refrigerated and aren't) and money is tight since we're down to one income.

1jlm418,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jlm418/my_exish_gf_asked_for_a_break/,My ex-ish gf asked for a break,"I (25M) and my ex(ish)-gf (27F) have been dating for seven months, and this is both of our first serious relationships. Things had been going really well‚Äîwe met each other‚Äôs families, spend time together every other day, and were even planning to move in together in three months when our leases ended. We laughed a lot, had fun together, went on vacation last week, and just a few days ago, I met her brother.

Then yesterday, she came over to my place out of nowhere and said, ‚ÄòI think we should break up.‚Äô I was caught off guard but said, ‚ÄòOkay,‚Äô and then she started listing reasons. One of the things was that we had been planning to move to LA in the future, but she‚Äôs from Colorado. She said it didn‚Äôt feel fair to either of us to completely rule out moving to Iowa 5 years down the line when we have a family, since that would be a big adjustment for me. I told her I was open to it‚ÄîI‚Äôve never even been to Colorado, so it‚Äôs too early for me to even judge whether I‚Äôd be okay with moving there.

Then she brought up that her love language is words of affirmation, and she felt like I didn‚Äôt really give her that. She said when I complimented her, it was mostly about her physical appearance, which made her feel a little uncomfortable. I told her I wished she had told me earlier that words of affirmation were her love language earlier as I genuinely didn‚Äôt know. In fact, one of the things on my to-do list was to take the love languages test with her, but we just never got around to it. And regardless of the breakup, I wanted her to know that I wasn‚Äôt dating her just for her looks‚ÄîI loved her because she‚Äôs smart, funny, and so much more. That led to a bit of a heartfelt moment between us.

At that point, I also brought up how she never really complimented me either. She said, ‚ÄòWell, I complimented your haircut the other week.‚Äô And I told her that didn‚Äôt really count‚Äîeveryone gets complimented after a haircut.

Then she mentioned another issue: when we cuddle, I sometimes randomly grab her ass, and it made her feel gross. I immediately apologized and told her I had no idea it made her feel that way. I told her I could see how that might take away from the sweetness of cuddling, and told her that when we cuddled i did it out of love and I just grabbed her ass just out of habit and i was sorry.

The whole conversation kind of followed this pattern‚Äîshe would bring something up, and I would respond in a way that seemed to make her feel better. Eventually, I stopped and asked, ‚ÄòWait, what are we even doing? If you really want to break up, we don‚Äôt have to keep talking‚ÄîI accept your decision.‚Äô But she said, ‚ÄòNo, I want to keep talking.‚Äô

So I asked, ‚ÄòWhat do you even want?‚Äô And she said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô That‚Äôs when I pointed out that she came in saying she wanted to break up, but now it didn‚Äôt really seem like she was sure. I asked if she wanted to take a one-week break instead, and she said yes.

Honestly, I feel like this whole thing came down to poor communication. She said she‚Äôd been feeling this way for a month or two, but we had never actually talked about any of these issues before. And once we did, it seemed like she kind of changed her mind. We went over some more points she had and once or twice in the middle of the convo I stopped and said hey I feel like I‚Äôm convincing u to stay with me right now, which is wrong and I‚Äôm sorry, don‚Äôt worry if you want to break up I respect your decision and there‚Äôs no hard feelings.

After that, I brought up a few things that had been bothering me in the relationship, and she listened and agreed. The convo ended by me saying, okay we can take a one week break so you can make ur decision, then in one we can goto a coffee shop and you can break up with me then. Don‚Äôt worry, if you want to break up I won‚Äôt talk shit to our friends etc, and it‚Äôll all be okay, don‚Äôt worry.

When we stood up, I said let‚Äôs grab all your stuff from my place, and we went around collecting her things. Before she left, I double-checked to make sure she had everything, and that was that.

Now, I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I like her a lot, and after talking to my friends, it feels like all the reasons she wanted to break up were just normal relationship issues that could‚Äôve been solved with better communication. She also has never been in a relationship before and has a very avoidant attachment style. I know the right thing to do is to respect the one-week break and not text her, but I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs really the best move. I want to tell her that this all stems from poor communication and how much I care about and I wish i knew everything she brought up to me so i could adjust and make her happy. I genuinely like her a lot and see us going the long way, but if she breaks up I will accept it and move on. Did i handle this right?????",4,1743133107.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1jlm1hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1jlm1hu/why_do_some_consumers_prioritize_brand_identity/,Why do some consumers prioritize brand identity over product functionality?,"While product functionality is essential, many consumers place a higher value on **brand identity** due to psychological, emotional, and social factors. Here‚Äôs why:

# 1. Emotional Connection & Brand Loyalty

* Consumers often form **emotional bonds** with brands that align with their values, aspirations, or personal identity.
* Example: Apple users remain loyal not just for the technology but because Apple represents innovation, exclusivity, and simplicity.

# 2. Social Status & Self-Expression

* Some brands serve as **status symbols** or expressions of identity.
* Example: Luxury brands like Gucci or Rolex are chosen for the prestige they offer, not necessarily for superior functionality.

# 3. Trust & Perceived Quality

* A strong brand identity signals **reliability and consistency**, even if other products perform equally well.
* Example: Nike customers trust the brand‚Äôs innovation in athletic wear, even when competing products have similar features.

# 4. Storytelling & Brand Purpose

* Brands that tell compelling stories or support causes create **deeper consumer loyalty**.
* Example: Patagonia attracts eco-conscious consumers because of its sustainability mission.

# 5. Psychological Comfort & Habit

* Many consumers stick to familiar brands due to **habit and cognitive ease**, avoiding the effort of evaluating alternatives.
* Example: People rebuy the same coffee brand out of routine rather than exploring better-tasting options.

# 6. Community & Belonging

* Brands create **communities** where consumers feel a sense of belonging.
* Example: Tesla owners share an identity as forward-thinking, eco-friendly tech enthusiasts.

# Conclusion

Consumers often prioritize **brand identity over functionality** because of **emotional connection, social status, trust, and habit**. A strong brand is more than a product‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience, a statement, and a lifestyle.",1,1743132870.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

1jlm1es,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jlm1es/lowkey_bullied_my_ex_off_the_internet_by_accident/,Lowkey bullied my ex off the internet by accident because he cheated on me,"To begin this I‚Äôd like to disclose that I don‚Äôt necessarily care if ITAH at the end of the day, but I‚Äôm wondering if I should be as at peace with this situation as I am. 

So beginning fall last year, I (f23) was a good  few months out of an abusive relationship and just finally feeling good on my own again. I started working and just worrying about me. My mental health was recovering and I felt good and ready to start dating but I definitely wasn‚Äôt looking for it. Then of course, one day I‚Äôm working my job at a coffee shop and this blonde hair blue eyed young construction worker with a mustache and a mullet, (I can‚Äôt make this upüò≠) walked into our store with this aura. Literally atp I‚Äôm convinced the devil gave him his charm but I digress. He flirts with me. Gives me his name leaves the store. I‚Äôm sick and out of work for the next 3 weeks. He was coming back to look for me every day while I was gone. One day I‚Äôm feeling better and sampling in the hallway and he walks in looking into my store for me and I said ‚ÄúGoodmorning!! :)))‚Äù and he saw me and lit up. He took a sample, chatted me up, asked me on a date.

We started texted a lot and we got along so well. He had my same sense of humor, he seemed sweet and sensitive. We finally get to the weekend and go on our date. He takes me for food and drinks (neither of us ate), we watched the sunset, and went back to his place. After that we spent every break-3 times a day. 5 days a week together. And then we spent the whole weekends together. After a bit he posted me and his ex began to dm me on TikTok. 

He had told me about his ex before any of this just never a name. He told me she had really bad addiction and cheating problems and that she was abusive to keep it short. He comments and DMs were incoherent and sloppy and he had been nothing but kind to me so when she sent accusations about him to me, I believe him saying she was ‚Äútrying to break us up because she wanted him back‚Äù but she DID. AND SHE WAS. BUTTTT. 

As it turns out he was still fw her. The ENTIRE TIME. 

I met his family. We spent our time together. She sent so many accusations that he had shared his location with me a month in. I met all his friends. We spent Christmas together at each of our homes with our families and he sat across from me telling me he was ‚Äúfalling in love with me so fast.‚Äù

FAST FORWARD A WEEK. 

He acts weird on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Turns out she texted him. He ends up lying to me about talking to her on the phone. She finally sends a coherent message with proof. I break up with him but we are cool because I had an inkling he wasn‚Äôt over her anyway and I wasn‚Äôt mad at him for being in love. Just lying. 

A few days go by my friends and I are making fun of him to make me feel better. Lowkey clowning him and all our ex‚Äôs for being gey (sorry). And I start connecting dots abt seeing him follow a few more trans women I would expect from him. Which ik not gey but yall know my brain got running. I go look on his twitter he doesn‚Äôt know I know about. I see he‚Äôs following a trans bbc porn account it‚Äôs private. As I look closed he‚Äôs following a lot of women with bulges in their panties if you know what I mean. Many more things happened but I‚Äôm not here to shame him for it. I just immediately felt like I had NO CLUE who this man was. He acted like he would NEVER dabble in anything even remotely not completely straight. Idk what‚Äôs offensive I‚Äôm sorry ily trans community. This again is not a diss to anyone. Again it was almost scary how I felt like I didn‚Äôt know him. His ex and I become friends and we plot and just post him on a local dating page to see what else we‚Äôre missing. I was so scared to have caught something from anyone he could be getting with. 

We post and there‚Äôs many comments roasting him. I forgot to mention he freestyles on TikTok and makes awful rap he thinks is good and everyone thinks it‚Äôs stand up. Again. Can‚Äôt even make this up. These comments were WRECKING HIMMM we didn‚Äôt even mean to clown him we just were nosey. Anyway he has since deleted all his post of his rap on TikTok and insta and went private. üò≠ his girl bestie who is just as evil as him is also in the page so I know she showed him. 

Cherry on top is that he lied and lied about liking trans women which again nobody has a problem with but he ONLY likes that and is dating bio women to use them as beards and causing insane trauma. Then comes a trans women dropping LOREEE abt him being crazy in the comments and ending with ‚Äúpersonal experience‚Äù

I can‚Äôt help but take this all as me kinda bullying him off the internet but I def don‚Äôt feel bad yall.

1jllyyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1jllyyx/is_est√©e_lauder_double_wear_worth_the_price_a/,Is Est√©e Lauder Double Wear Worth the Price? A Quick Look.,"I've been testing the iconic Est√©e Lauder Double Wear foundation for the past three months, and let me tell you‚Äîthere's a reason this little bottle has reached holy grail status for so many makeup lovers. As someone who's tried everything from $5 drugstore foundations to $80 luxury options, I'm always skeptical when products achieve ""cult status."" Is it really that good, or just clever marketing?

# My Experience with Est√©e Lauder Double Wear Performance

The first time I applied Est√©e Lauder Double Wear, I was heading to an outdoor wedding in July‚Äîbasically the ultimate foundation endurance test. Temperature was 94 degrees, humidity was through the roof, and I was helping the bride with last-minute details (read: sweating like crazy).

Usually, my foundation starts breaking down around my nose and chin within a few hours in these conditions. But the Double Wear? It literally didn't budge for 12 straight hours. I was genuinely shocked when I checked my makeup in the car mirror at the end of the night. It looked almost identical to when I'd applied it that morning.

# Coverage That Actually Covers

One thing I've noticed about Est√©e Lauder Double Wear is that a little goes a long way. I've been using the same bottle for three months now with regular use, and I'm only about a third of the way through it. That definitely helps justify the price tag.

The coverage is buildable, which means you can go from medium to full coverage depending on how much you apply and how you apply it. I've found that a beauty blender gives more natural coverage, while a dense foundation brush provides that flawless, airbrushed look.

# Shade Range Reality Check

With 55+ shades available, finding your match should be easy... right? Well, sort of. While the range is impressive, I've found that the undertones can be tricky. I initially got matched to a shade that looked perfect in Sephora lighting but turned slightly peachy in natural light.

My advice? Get samples of at least 2-3 shades that look close to your skin tone and test them in natural lighting. It took me two tries to find my perfect match (1W2 Sand, if you're curious), but once I did, it was spot on.

# Is the Est√©e Lauder Double Wear Price Tag Justified?

Let's talk about the elephant in the room‚Äîthe price. At around $49 for 1 oz, Est√©e Lauder Double Wear isn't cheap. So is it worth it? Here's my breakdown after using it consistently:

# Cost Per Wear Analysis

I did some math (not my strongest skill, but I tried!) to figure out the actual cost per application:

* $49 bottle typically lasts about 4-5 months with regular use
* That's about 120 applications if you wear it 5 days a week
* Which comes out to roughly $0.40 per wear

When I think about it that way, spending 40 cents per day for flawless makeup that lasts through everything from meetings to happy hours seems pretty reasonable. I've definitely spent more on coffee that lasted me all of 20 minutes!

# Comparing to Other Luxury Foundations

I've previously used foundations from Dior, Charlotte Tilbury, and Armani. Here's how Est√©e Lauder Double Wear stacks up:

* Lasts longer than most (including the $65 Armani Luminous Silk)
* More transfer-resistant than any I've tried
* Doesn't require touch-ups throughout the day
* Doesn't oxidize and change color halfway through the day

The only foundation that came close in performance was the Dior Forever, which is actually $5 more expensive. So from a luxury foundation perspective, Double Wear delivers equal or better performance at a slightly lower price point.

# The Downsides of Est√©e Lauder Double Wear (Yes, There Are Some)

It's not all perfect‚Äînothing ever is. After three months of use, I've noticed a few potential downsides that might be dealbreakers for some people:

# The Matte Finish Isn't for Everyone

If you love the dewy, glass skin look, Double Wear in its original formulation probably isn't for you. It has a decidedly matte finish that, while not flat or cakey, definitely isn't dewy.

I've found a workaround by mixing in a drop of liquid highlighter or facial oil when I want a more luminous finish. But if you're strictly a dewy foundation person, you might want to check out the Double Wear Light version instead.

# It Can Feel Heavy on No-Makeup Days

On days when I want very minimal makeup, Double Wear can feel like... well, too much. It's definitely a foundation that feels like you're wearing foundation. I've started keeping a tinted moisturizer on hand for those super casual days when I just need a bit of evening out.

[Check out Est√©e Lauder Double Wear on Amazon](https://amzn.to/43vtrl8)

# The Packaging Could Be Better

For a luxury product, I was surprised that Double Wear doesn't come with a pump. You have to pour it out, which can get messy and wastes product. I ended up buying a separate pump that fits the bottle for about $8, which solved the problem but seemed like an unnecessary extra step for a high-end foundation.

# Who Should Buy Est√©e Lauder Double Wear?

After my experience, I think Double Wear is best suited for:

# People Who Need Serious Staying Power

If your foundation usually disappears by lunchtime, or if you have long days with no time for touch-ups, Double Wear will be a game-changer. It easily lasts through a full workday plus evening activities without needing any fixes.

# Anyone with Oily or Combination Skin

The oil-controlling properties of this foundation are impressive. The areas where I typically get shiny midday (forehead and nose) stay matte much longer with Double Wear than with other foundations I've tried.

# Special Occasion Makeup Wearers

If you're looking for something for weddings, important events, or photos, Double Wear performs beautifully. It doesn't have flashback in photos, and it won't transfer onto clothes (or your date's shirt collar).

# My Final Verdict on Est√©e Lauder Double Wear

Is Est√©e Lauder Double Wear worth the price? For me, the answer is a clear yes. The performance, longevity, and reliability make it worth every penny. I've actually saved money by not having to try new foundations every few months, hoping to find something that works.

That said, it's not going to be right for everyone. If you prefer light coverage, a dewy finish, or rarely wear foundation for more than a few hours at a time, there are cheaper options that might suit you better.

But if longevity, coverage, and dependable performance are your priorities, Double Wear delivers in spades. Three months in, and it's earned a permanent spot in my makeup routine. And trust me, with the number of products that have come and gone from my vanity over the years, that's saying something!

You've been warned.

I've been working on a 2005 freight pusher, with the cat C-7 most of the morning. Came in for a service and diagnostic read. Has inactive codes for boost control unusable signal, exhaust temp too high derate, fuel pressure too low, fuel pressure too low on cranking. Customer thought he may have poor fuel, said there was single instance of going uphill and a loss of power, hence the derate.

Proceeded to complete the service with fuel filters, gen svc with fuel and air filters, customer would like to look at the air filter, and it's in a bear of a spot, but I yard the elbows off and give her the light test. It's dirty as shit and I sell the customer on a new filter, about $500 part just for reference.  

The air filter part number is torn away on the label, so it goes to napa to be id'ed and I take my lunch. Get back and wrestle the new filter into place, start the vehicle and it runs like poo after a poor cranking start. Reprime the fuel system a few times, no dice. Low fuel pressure on cranking and low fuel pressure something else codes, major PITA priming that fuel filter assembly at the top of the motor. Put a tighter wrench on the filters, same story. 

Fuel pressure is at and near the requested value, so after fighting with it well into the afternoon, I inform the customer it will require diagnostic protocol for the boost sensor and this mf says, ""yeah, that's what the guy down south said.""

Did I mention this man had been a waiter, ""jus tryna watch and learn a few things about diesels!"" he says. The whole morning, from the rear access panel, to the front of coach for the gen service, and back to the rear for the air filter, this man had taken my oblong milk crate and used it as a chair. Just hangin' out. I made the suggestion about the waiting room and free coffee, but it didn't take; my manager would have gladly mandated the customer wait inside, but it was incredibly busy this morning at the rest of the shop, I can handle a waiter, no probs.

Now, to his credit, this guy was holding out with the strongest waiting game I have seen in my few years, just watching me ass-over-teakettle get covered in dirt working on the air filter. He was there starting the truck after I had been priming the fuel system a handful of times. He almost looked the slightest bit tired right before I gave the news about needing further diagnostics, before he lighted up and said, my favorite, ""yeah the dude at the other shop I went to said the same thing."" But he also had very much no probs peaceout bean sprout, got a ride and bounced, like it was my problem now. 

I really actually love my job though, and I told homie multiple times. We talked a bunch over the few hours of this experience, I'm not going to be bothered by someone who likes to know what's going on. I can talk for days about proper maintenance practices, opening my own shop one day, doing pre trip inspections on folks' coaches and finding tires off the bead. I can give it back to them, is what I'm trying to say.

I began working at an ice cream shop a the beginning of this month (March, 2025), I just finished training and it hasn't been a full month yet but I strongly dislike working here and I can feel in my gut that this job is not a good fit for me.

1. My previous job (temporarily contracted) paid $18.50/hourly, and unfortunately this job is only paying $15/hourly. My co-workers continually tell me that in the summertime when it'll be busier we'll get more tips and the rates will move up to $19-$24/hourly.
2. As I provided in the context, I have anxiety & depression. I tend to get tense, nervous and sometimes jittery. I'm hyper aware of my interactions with others and how they may be perceiving me but this has never affected my work ethic. I'm just providing these details because I just began taking medication (lexapro) for it. I'm still in the testing stage/finding the right fit of medication.
3. Due to my anxiety, I don't believe that working in a high pace environment with so much room for mistakes and triggers is healthy for me. When I had accepted the job I craved new experience and I thought I'd be able to stick it out while trying something new but I now realize that I do not enjoy this experience and it's making me feel terrible.
4. My manager triggers me constantly. My manager is mean. When I say mean I don‚Äôt mean like maliciously mean, but I mean she‚Äôs a ‚Äòtough-love‚Äô kind of manager, but I‚Äôve never experienced that with any of my previous managers. She constantly is pointing out things I‚Äôm doing incorrectly, when I ask questions about things I don‚Äôt know or haven‚Äôt been trained on yet she asks the question back to me like I‚Äôm an idiot. For example, I don‚Äôt drink coffee, nor do I make it, and I haven‚Äôt been trained on it yet. So whenever a customer asks for coffee, I ask one of my coworkers to make it & they have no problem doing so, but whenever she‚Äôs there & I ask, she looks at me like I‚Äôm an idiot and she asks, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how to make coffee? It‚Äôs not rocket science‚Äù etc etc. One time I forgot where the water cups were and she was like ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know where the cups are? Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs important to know? Didn‚Äôt we show you where they are?‚Äù. And because I already have issues with people pleasing/anxiety, this puts me even more on edge when I‚Äôm working, especially when she‚Äôs on the shift with me.
5. I'm a woman of color & I have type 4 hair. I enjoy my freedom when it comes to wearing my hair out in afro's, puffy slick ponytails, braids, updos, you name it. Unfortunately working within food requires me to wear a hat every single time I work which means I'm restricted to wearing a tight bun that can be easily hidden by a hat. This lack of freedom in expression feels heavy on me, especially as the summer season arrives because it will be too hot for me to constantly try to pull back my hair.
6. I'm the only High Schooler & African American person that works there which is not usually something that bothers me but I just thought I'd point those out because I'm not sure if either has a connection to her treatment towards me.

I've resigned from jobs in the past as a minor using the two week notice letter method but for some reason I feel a lot more afraid of using that method with this workspace. I feel afraid that if I put in a two week notice my manager will retaliate and treat me worse. After asking people in my life for advice they've all told me to just straight out quit without notice but I'm afraid of that back firing because I am no longer a minor.

She has short hair, I can't remember for sure if it's blue or black, but I do remember that she has big breasts and she uses this to try to provoke the boys, who are then expelled from school when she touches them. The boy is tall and has short, straight hair. He's quite serious and wears glasses. He even helped her once with a math test (I think).

I'd like to know more about this one than the other, but I don't know if anyone will. It's a manga where a teacher goes to one of those markets in Japan and always buys the same things, I think it was a coffee and something else. But the sales clerk starts to like him.

1jllrvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1jllrvr/the_art_of_pretending/,The Art of Pretending,"The hum of the engine filled the silence between us as I navigated through the afternoon traffic. She sat in the passenger seat, legs tucked beneath her, flipping through an old paperback she had pulled from my backseat. The golden light of the setting sun streamed through the windshield, catching the highlights in her blonde hair and making her look almost ethereal.

I stole a glance at her, my fingers tightening around the steering wheel. She had always been my best friend‚Äîmy constant, my anchor in the storm. But lately, every moment with her felt heavier, like I was carrying something I couldn‚Äôt put down.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked, catching me staring. Her lips curved into that familiar, teasing smile.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said quickly, eyes flicking back to the road. ‚ÄúJust wondering how many times you‚Äôve read that book.‚Äù

She laughed, holding it up. ""Too many. But it‚Äôs comforting. Like an old friend.""

I nodded, understanding more than I wanted to admit. The bookstore was only a few minutes away, but I wished the drive would stretch on forever. This in-between space‚Äîwhere we were still us but not really‚Äîwas the only place I knew how to exist around her anymore.

‚ÄúAfter the bookstore, can we stop by the plant shop?‚Äù she asked, tapping her fingers against the dashboard. ‚ÄúI need something new for my windowsill.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, because I could never say no to her.

She beamed, and for a moment, it felt like old times. Just us, no complications, no looming reality waiting to pull me under.

The bookstore was nestled between a coffee shop and a vintage record store, the kind of place that smelled of old pages and warm nostalgia. As soon as we stepped inside, she drifted off toward the fiction section, her fingers grazing the spines of books like each one held a secret meant only for her.

I trailed behind, pretending to browse, but mostly watching her. She was effortlessly radiant, and I hated how much I still loved her.

‚ÄúFound it!‚Äù she announced, holding up a novel triumphantly.

I smiled, but my mind was elsewhere, tangled in what-ifs and maybes. I had spent years convincing myself that my feelings would fade, that time would ease the ache. But time had only sharpened it, making every moment with her more bittersweet.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked, studying me with that familiar concern.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúJust thinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

I hesitated, my hands curling into my pockets. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù

She blinked, surprise flickering across her face before she softened. She didn‚Äôt ask for an explanation, just handed me the book she had found. ‚ÄúYou should read this.‚Äù

I took it from her, our fingers brushing for the briefest moment. Even that small contact sent my heart into a freefall. The quiet in the bookstore suddenly felt suffocating, the weight of everything unsaid pressing down on me.

Stepping outside, she linked her arm through mine, her warmth a painful reminder of what I couldn‚Äôt have.

The drive back to her apartment was filled with a silence that spoke louder than words. Not awkward, just heavy. I could feel the weight of what I didn‚Äôt say settling between us.

She traced patterns on the window with her fingertips, her voice breaking the quiet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been quiet today.‚Äù

I exhaled. ‚ÄúJust thinking.‚Äù

Her eyes flickered to me. ‚ÄúAbout me?‚Äù

I gripped the steering wheel tighter. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Her lips parted slightly, like she wanted to ask more, but the moment passed as the light turned green.

Instead of heading straight to her apartment, we stopped at the plant store. She wandered through the aisles, gently touching the leaves, pausing every so often to admire a new bloom. I watched her, memorizing the way she moved, as if trying to hold on to something slipping through my fingers.

‚ÄúHarper and I finally set a date,‚Äù she said suddenly, cradling a succulent in her hands.

My stomach tightened. ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

She nodded, then turned to me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come to the engagement party, right?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Her brows pulled together. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my gaze dropping to the rows of greenery in front of us. ‚ÄúBecause it hurts.‚Äù

Her face softened. ‚ÄúI never wanted to hurt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù I met her gaze, forcing a small smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach my eyes. ‚ÄúBut you did.‚Äù

She reached for my hand, giving it a brief squeeze before letting go. ‚ÄúI still want you there.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could survive watching her promise forever to someone else. But still, I nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlant store?‚Äù She was so cute when she asked. Eyes big and smile wide.

I nodded and put on a grin, ‚ÄúPlant store, buddy.‚Äù

We moved through the shop slowly, the scent of fresh soil and greenery wrapping around us. She ran her fingers over the leaves of a fiddle-leaf fig, then stopped to admire a tiny cactus in a ceramic pot.

‚ÄúThis one,‚Äù she said decisively, holding it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs small, but it‚Äôs resilient. I like that.‚Äù

I forced a smile. ‚ÄúGood choice.‚Äù

She tilted her head, studying me. ‚ÄúWhat about you? Want to get one?‚Äù

I looked around, scanning the plants, but my heart wasn‚Äôt in it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she nudged my arm. ‚ÄúEven you could use a little growth.‚Äù

I huffed a quiet laugh, shaking my head. But then I saw it‚Äîa simple ivy plant, winding and stubborn. I picked it up, turning it in my hands. ‚ÄúOkay, this one.‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúSee? I knew you had it in you.‚Äù

As we paid and walked out, she hugged her cactus to her chest. ‚ÄúThanks for coming with me.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

But as she talked about where she‚Äôd place her new plant, my mind drifted. Growth was good, necessary even. But some things‚Äîsome feelings‚Äîrooted themselves too deep to ever be uprooted completely.",1,1743132018.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

I think my ROTC scholarship had a huge factor in getting me into Georgetown, bc I don't really see how else I get in there LMAO. I want my journey to just show that it only takes one! (or two), but even if you don't have the typical cracked profiles you typically see on these subreddits it's still possible to bag your dream. Throughout high school I applied and didn't get tons of DC programs, (senate page, etc.) and thought it was all over for me because my ECs weren't directly connected to poli sci at all but it all worked out in the end!

I used to work in ECE, but currently I am a nanny. I care for a 2 year old. 

Recently, they (the 2yo) have been experiencing some intense meltdowns/fear/anxiety. For example, I bought them a new book, it is a Bluey book that makes noise. When I introduced it to them, they freaked out, ran and hid and were crying holding their ears. I had to hide the book. They also act this way to normal household things. The vacuum, the dishwasher,  the coffee maker, even when these things aren't running or making any noise. I will say when they were younger they were reasonably spooked by these things, then kinda got over it but within these past few months it's become like this. Same thing for almost any new toys, I brought some fun baby animals/adult animals matching figurines and they reacted this same way, or if I try to get them to try a new food, it's almost always the same response, crying and putting their finger in or over their ears. I have worked with quite a bit of toddlers and I've never experienced this behavior before. Only once with a 4 year old who ended up being diagnosed on the spectrum. I don't think I've ever cared for a toddler who was so closed off and skittish to nearly anything new/unfamiliar. 

Has anyone else experienced this in a toddler around this age, maybe 1.5 - 2.5 years? If so, is it a indicator or warning sign. Of course everything I read said it's 'age appropriate behavior', but this behavior is really raising some flags for me. ",2,1743131592.0,ECEProfessionals,7,1.0,False

I feel stuck at the point where I can‚Äôt get out of bed. 

When I first found the condoms we were 3 days or so from our wedding. My immediate reaction was to figure it out but I needed to hear everything and quickly so I can decide if there was anything that was too much that I couldn‚Äôt figure out in R during marriage.

I‚Äôm curious mostly on what people think about seeing everything? All messages etc. He is very much against it which of course he doesn‚Äôt want to show everything. I know it will destroy me to see it all but part of me thinks that‚Äôs what I need so I can have the full picture because he is definitely softening the story and trickle truthing. The story I know now is this:

He got addicted to porn 5 years ago - he‚Äôs working from home due to COVID and I don‚Äôt WFH. 2 years ago he joins fetlife for porn reasons and to chat with other users. No one ever responds to him. 1 year and a bit ago he messaged her and she‚Äôs desperate enough to respond. They talk on Snapchat (an area where he has TT). He had said he sent couple photos here and there and none of him nude and that she sent just like boob pictures. Him just photos of his boner through his pants. Now, the story is that they have over 2000 Snapchat points‚Ä¶ still he says mostly videos of her dressing in leather for him‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs always conveniently not him sending things or engaging. He‚Äôs just a passenger on her train. 

They meet at a fancy restaurant in our city. Which to be clear was after he had been away for a week from me and I had an event - 1 block from the restaurant they met at. He encouraged me to go to this event despite me not wanting to go because I missed him. He doesn‚Äôt respond for 3 hours which is common with him because he has a medically diagnosed sleep disorder - can fall asleep in 5 seconds if he doesn‚Äôt take his meds and if I don‚Äôt encourage him he will just sleep for up to 16 hours a day. 

They hooked up then met up 4 more times while I was at work or out with friends in the following few weeks. Then a few months without any hookups. We take a beautiful trip to Europe, we come home and I jump through hoops just to be able to celebrate his dad‚Äôs retirement. 

Then they thought they could hangout (day after my birthday while I was at work) and it lead to sex that he is saying he didn‚Äôt want but he felt obligated to. Then from there no physical sexual contact they had a conversation about just being friends. 

They have hung out 4-5 times over 8 months since then. they just so happen to have very in common hobbies but they also would have flirtatious messages which is why he doesn‚Äôt want to show me them but will if I ask. It does seem very mundane but still hurtful what he has shown me. She calls him cute a couple months ago, he says she looks hot (a photo where she is bundled up head to toe to ski and a mile a way from the camera). 

They mostly recently hung out 1 month before wedding day to go for a run with another friend. I can see it via his gps tracking watch. Obviously ways to manipulate and pause it etc. 

How I found out is he couldn‚Äôt find his passport to travel for our weddings so I remembered a small backpack he has used for aforementioned Europe trip and in a tiny pocket I found condoms and a face mask used for fetish stuff. 

Anyways that‚Äôs the story that has unfortunately become my story. 

He is truly remorseful and I can see that. I have scheduled IC and he has reached out to somewhere he found but hasn‚Äôt heard back yet. 

Mostly, I‚Äôm looking for advice about ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù and what you felt you needed to move on or get the full picture. I feel like I‚Äôm asking him so many questions and getting so devastated about tiny details that hadn‚Äôt been shared with me before. What else did you ask for that helped? I feel manic at some points and just want to book a trip on his credit card that I have. I went to the mall once and the worst I could do was spend $160 at Sephora even though he said so your worst. But that doesn‚Äôt help but I‚Äôm open to crazy ideas. Did you ask for him to move out for a month? Pay for a spa weekend? Go on a trip? Move out yourself but not tell him how long it would be until you attempted R?

So far he has been writing me daily letters, giving me a daily coffee flight he calls it from my favourite coffee place(3 coffees that he puts on a charcuterie board while I work), he paid for a stupidly expensive pedicure, he‚Äôs bought me an insane amount of clothes from my favourite store, he shared his location with me, he has stopped hiding his phone from me, h hands me his phone for somethings. He‚Äôs been very loving in ways I‚Äôve always wanted and very open past showing me the specifics in ways I never thought he could be. He‚Äôs listed specific ways where I was 100% right before about his communication issues but he was too afraid to say. He‚Äôs been incredibly patient when I breakdown. I‚Äôve completely torn him down and insulted him and he takes it and agrees. I‚Äôve had melt downs and he‚Äôs there for me 100%. He‚Äôs created a list of 50 date nights that are all very well thought out. He‚Äôs printed photos from our wedding day where he thinks I look beautiful and gives me a different one each day. I feel like an idiot for this one but also I think it‚Äôs common now from what I‚Äôve read but he has made me orgasm 40+ times since. He has stayed with me even when I have pushed him away. He puts food in front of me even when I say I‚Äôm not hungry and refills my water bottle. He‚Äôs been a model WH I think in most ways.

I am an extremely empathetic and non judgemental person and can easily put myself in his shoes even though I wouldn‚Äôt do what he did. I have always been that way for anything. I think R would be easy for me - what makes it hard is the extent of it. I think had it been 1 really crazy wild fun day for him I would be able to accept it or 2-3 times. The meeting again on my birthday weekend and then continue to chat and meetup are what devastated me and make me feel like I can‚Äôt breathe.

The last part of this is if you looked at my post history (and deleted post history) we have struggled with a dead bedroom throughout the last few years that I finally now get to understand. For years my confidence was on the floor because I wasn‚Äôt even being cuddled or kissed in non sexual ways. I was begging for compliments. Then I had a devastating family crisis that brought up terrible memories for me of CSA. For which he was no support and I was asking him very clearly to be a bigger support. He basically cut himself off from me.

I hope this post is ok. I‚Äôm so back and forth in the rawness of it all but mostly lean towards r and need advice and someone to talk to that‚Äôs not him",4,1743131569.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,1,1.0,False

During my 3rd period, we were reading The Great Gatsby as a class. One of my students (15F) got pulled out by a math intern (23-24M) because her friend (17M) needed help with a health class. She took her backpack and coffee, but left her worksheet behind.

At the end of the period, after everyone had left, I noticed her worksheet still sitting there. I picked it up just to see if I needed to hold onto it for the next class. That‚Äôs when I found out she‚Äôd written some personal stuff in the margins of the worksheet. Apparently, she has a crush on Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby, and was writing about how badly she ships them. Okay, fine.

- Quick customer service when nearby areas were having network issues, etc.

- Ability to create multiple ‚Äòsavers‚Äô accounts to visualise your money better, and a respectable interest rate on up to five of these (calculated daily and distributed monthly)

At the moment there‚Äôs a promo if you sign up using an existing customer‚Äôs referral link - **we both get an instant $14!** For practically no work at all! That‚Äôs a boost on groceries (or cheeky bevvy) right there.

After lurking for a long time and getting a LOT of helpful suggestions, I thought I would give back and add to the pile of reviews on here.

These are candles from my hauls over the last year or so!¬†

The ratings try to convey how good they are in general, and/or how much they capture what is on the label‚Ä¶

**1 - RAINBOW SUGAR**

Ok, I‚Äôm going to get this one out of the way. I truly think‚Ä¶ hope‚Ä¶ that I got a mislabeled candle or a bad batch or something. From other reviews, I was envisioning anything from Spree to¬† Starburst to Cotton Candy. It smells like warm Jergens¬© hand lotion. I wish I was exaggerating.

**0/10**

**2 - GRAPE SODA**

Much better news. The prevalent reviews talk about its uncanny similarity to its namesake. These reviews are dead on. This smells so much like grape soda, you can almost smell the carbonation.

**10/10**

**3 - POP TARTS**

**Cherry** \- Worth trying. Semi-generic cherry smell, but a bit of pastry to give it a pop tart vibe. **7.5/10**

**Blueberry -** GOOD, but being held back by a blueberry that smells slightly grape/ wine like.¬† **6.5/10**

**Brown Sugar - Very disappointing**. I LOVE the pop tart of the same name. This is an eye-watering cinnamon bomb. No subtleties, pastry or brown sugar to cut it. Get it if you crave a life of cinnamon dreams, and many trips to the medicine cabinet for Visine. **3/10**

**4- Christmas Village**

My wife had been searching for a good ‚Äòstraight peppermint‚Äô candle for a while. This makes your house smell like you are living in the middle of one of those meltaway peppermint balls. Enveloping, yet somehow subtle. You ‚Äòfeel‚Äô the peppermint without the sharpness; You‚Äôre living in a peppermint cloud.

**9/10**

**5- Gingerbread donut**

As above, my wife had been searching for a ‚Äògood gingerbread‚Äô candle.

Sadly, the search continues‚Ä¶

**3/10**

**6- Campfire Marshmallow**

The throw is a bit light‚Ä¶ but if you put in the effort, she will reward you.

A haiku is in order:

Subtly smoky

A sweet marshmallow feeling‚Ä¶

On a winters‚Äô night.

**8.5/10**

**7- Coffee House**

The search continues for a good, basic coffee candle; the chocolate notes are too pronounced. Would like this better if it were called ‚ÄòMocha House‚Äô.¬†

As Mocha house, I‚Äôd give it a 9.

As Coffee house, it gets

**6.5/10**

**8- Sugared Apple Granola**

Simple review- smells as though you are baking an apple crumble.¬†

**9/10**

**9- Toasty Pumpkin Toddy**

Not sure how to properly describe it. Definitely has a very ‚Äòadult‚Äô vibe. Reminds me of old fashion alcohol beverages from a bygone era, a bit of musk, and an almost a tobacco like quality. Really complex, but in a delightful way.¬†

Would not blindly recommend this, but I love it.

**9.5/10**

**10 - Key Lime Cake Pop / Limoncello Cupcake**

I lump these together because they have the same pros and cons. They both have great throw and definitely convey their respective citrus baked good flavors. That being said, they both have an underlying‚Ä¶ odd element to them? I THINK the smell is supposed to convey the ‚Äòbaked‚Äô aspect, but instead it just‚Ä¶ distracts and detracts. Good and maybe worth a try, but not sure I would re-buy.

**6/10**

**11 - Red, White and Blue**

You know those Red, White and Blue ice ‚ÄòBomb Pops‚Äô On the label?

That.

**10/10**

**12- Watermelon Bubble Gum**

You know those watermelon bubble gums of old‚Ä¶ like Bubble Yum, Hubba Bubba, etc?

That.

**10/10**

**13 - Boardwalk Cone**

Decent. I feel like it could be SLIGHTLY better as far as evoking the ‚Äòcone‚Äô element, but a pleasant experience overall.

**7/10**

**14 -Strawberry Sponge Cake**

Jury is out on this. Heard nothing but rave reviews. Its strength is also its negative. It smells almost TOO real: You know when you get a strawberry cake at a bakery and it sometimes has that ‚Äòartificial/jellied‚Äô strawberry sauce on it? That note is a bit TOO present. But high marks for realism‚Ä¶

**7.5/10**

**15 - Lemon Butter Cake**

Another baked good with rave reviews. It doesn‚Äôt overwhelm like, ‚ÄúHoly crap is that lemon cake‚Äô?!‚Äù, But it does reward those who appreciate the subtle nuances; The initial smell is underwhelming‚Ä¶ and then‚Ä¶wait‚Ä¶ is that‚Ä¶ is that a burnt piece of pound cake? The lemon starts to poke its head out‚Ä¶ and then once again takes a backseat to the pound cake. Not as amazing out of the gate as the reviews suggest‚Ä¶ but if you let the candle breath and present it‚Äôs different sides to you, you will enjoy it for its realism

**8.5/10**

**16 - Strawberry Shortcake Orange Blossom**

A mix between Orange Soda and that delightful orange Baby Aspirin... and of COURSE that's a good thing. Feel like it could be betTER, but pretty good overall

**8/10**

We were living in California for university neither of us are native so when we started dating we always said we wanted to meet her family but just never made it happen she's from Wyoming and I'm from NY so we always choose to visit mine because she said her town would have nothing to do. It wasn't even a full year since graduation and even with the best jobs we could find right after we still couldn't afford rent. So her family offered us a break saying if we moved in with them we wouldn't have to pay rent we could save money for as long as it takes to hopefully buy our house.

Obviously it wasn't my first choice but we both felt like we needed to humble ourselves because clearly we can't afford city life. It was good for the first few weeks since we were both hired almost instantly (healthcare and teaching). Her mom and younger siblings are great but there's something about her dad that makes me feel uncomfortable. He's a family doctor so I thought his comments about my body were because of that at first. He's tried to give me a massage saying my posture was bad, give me a physical, tell my body had beautiful porpotions, etc. The the worst two I can think of was when I had a fever and I wss resting my eyes, and he came in and sat on the edge of the bed. Then I felt him rubbing his hands on my hips he must have thought I was sleeping.

 I told Anna and she said he was just checking because I was sick. Another time he was showing me his drawings which I already didn't want to see, and then he told me I had ""lips like a woman"" and he asked to draw me. He wanted me in my underwear so I kept saying no and he kept said was fine because he's a doctor. Then he tried to close the door, but thank God, my MIL and their kids came home because I wonder if you would forced me if they weren't there. This time I told Anna and and she actually did agree to confront him too but then she and her mother ended up defending him saying it was all a misunderstanding and they were just an affectionate family. He was didn't even try to act humiliated during dinner that night he kept looking at me...

At first I didn't wanna complain or seem ungrateful especially since we're in such a good position to save money but even now it's starting to not feel worth it I'm not making as much money as I thought and neither is she certainly not enough to buy a house anywhere outside of Wyoming. Her dad keeps making me more and more uncomfortable each day two weeks ago he that I have a small so I would be easy to carry. It was so random he hadn't even said anything before that he just came up behind me while I was making my coffee. I wonder if he was trying to threaten me? I told my brother and he thought it was funny. He basically brushed me off, saying he was probably just old and creepy, but at least I don't have to pay rent. Yesterday, I told him that I wanted to break up if her dad kept being creepy but Anna got mad at me saying I was being dramatic, I'm paranoid, and I just don't like her family. I feel like I'm the only one who sees him as creepy.

I don‚Äôt even know where you went.
I don‚Äôt know the moment you stopped being reachable, or when the light in your voice dimmed.
I just know I miss you.
Not the dream, not the maybe-one-day version of us‚Äî
Just you.

You used to talk to me like I mattered.
You used to open up, share your thoughts, your humor, your heart‚Äîeven the parts you said you didn‚Äôt show anyone else.
You made me feel safe without trying.
And I think I made you feel understood.

And maybe that was the problem.
Maybe being seen made you want to disappear.

But god, I miss the simplicity of it.
The softness.
The knowing glances.
The way I didn‚Äôt have to prove anything to earn your attention.
The way your silence wasn‚Äôt a weapon back then‚Äîit was just space. Gentle, honest space.

Now, every silence from you feels loaded.
Heavy. Punishing.
Empty in all the wrong ways.

And I‚Äôm grieving something no one else saw‚Äî
A friendship buried under the wreckage of a love that never got to live.
A bond that got sacrificed to fear and confusion and timing and everything you wouldn‚Äôt say.

You were my friend before you were anything else.
And losing that version of you‚Äîthe one who wasn‚Äôt afraid to talk, to be, to care‚Äî
Hurts more than losing the version who claimed to love me.

I still carry the way you used to make me laugh. I still reminisce over all the little moments we had, working together for so many years. 
I still remember when you helped me move, when you made my sister food, the bug prank, how you shared half of your coffee with me - do you remember that? - the late night talks on the patio. Those little moments built trust and foundation. We showed up for each other when we were just friends. 
I still remember how good it felt to be near you before I was waiting on you.
Before I was hurting over you.
Before I was wondering if I even mattered anymore.

Maybe that version of you is gone for good.
Or maybe he‚Äôs still somewhere inside you, waiting for your courage to let him live again.

Either way‚Äîthank you.
For being real with me once.
Even if you couldn‚Äôt stay that way.
Even when my intensity made you retreat. 
I think we drove each other nuts. 
To even imagine someone could love either one of us like we love each other - man that‚Äôs scary. 
The fear drove us insane. 

I miss you.
But I‚Äôm learning to let go of who you were,
So I can finally stop hurting over what we became.

Each had a creepy piece of art on the cover and I ate them up. This was years ago though, now i cant find it when I search for this channel.
More specifically this one story,

There was this boy who was living in this house after his sister dies. I think she went crazy or something then vanished but as the kid was staying over there, the sister pops up and is being weird. He heard weird noises at night and even at one point records where he sleep on the couch and finds the sister being weird and turning the camera off.
He had made friends with this detective at one point who was looking in on her case and the boy was texting him all this stuff about his sister while he finished up a case before hopping over to this little town. At one point the sister gets weird (The order is a bit fuzzy) so he runs away and hides in this coffee shop and waits for the detective to show up. You can tell this kid is scared or even a bit mental because he‚Äôs so anxious about EVERYTHING after the sister‚Äôs friend didn‚Äôt believe the boy.
Anyways, the detective calls the boy and the kid hears as the police try to stop the detective but then a speed chase goes on and he gets thrown off the road or something and dies. The boy runs on foot to his parent‚Äôs house who are both missing. He bunkers down but eventually leaves for whatever reason and gets chased by these two officers who stop him. The officers lead him into the woods and the boy starts hearing stuff in the trees so he breaks free and steals the police car before driving over to the cemetery.
He finds his sister‚Äôs grave still in good shape and brings out a shovel, determined to dig up this grave and see if she‚Äôs still down there. The sister comes up and talks to him and even tells him to kill her but he caves and they embrace. She convinces him that he‚Äôs just going crazy and needs help so the police men let him off free but by the end of it he‚Äôs locked in the basement which the comments said could symbolize that he was locked away in an asylum.

Cool right? Does anyone recognize this story? Or even a channel who makes stuff like this?

I am logging the new creation of a new anomaly by our corporation.

Z-2736 is a liquid that can sustain human life infinitely while in bloodstream, no other side effects have been seen.

Z-2736 is annoyingly hard to take out of the bloodstream, near impossible, even on drop can replicate into a gallon if unchecked.

Z-2736-A is a skinless human who was injected with Z-2736. The human should be dead, as all of their vital organs have been removed, excusing the brain and heart for now.

Z-2736-A is effectively immortal.

Now, we have use for this, but I believe I can manipulate Z-2736 into a subset of it, which I will mark Z-2736-B for now.

This subset should hopefully be able to heal Z-2736-A and fix their organs for me if I just lob them back in.

Sadly, I have to disclose some more boring details somewhere in this log, so I suppose the middle is a good place to hide it.

Due to Z-2736-A being human, I have to disclose their name.

Z-2736-A is Adam Poltzer. Alias: HQ.

Okay, back to science!

I can use this poison I found in my coffee as some extra chemicals to add to Z-2736 to create Z-2736-B.

Although, I believe Z-2736 has some healing effects naturally. I‚Äôve noticed Z-2736-A has some regrowth of skin and internal organs despite no way to regenerate such matter.

I will investigate this further.

Good bye, Urbanshade!

I will see you soon.

For some background I have always felt excluded from that side of the family. My aunt would drive over an hour to see my cousin all the time but would never drive 2 hours for me.

I live 30 mins away and there was no offer extended. I know I could have asked but that‚Äôs not the kind of person I am inviting myself when I don‚Äôt even feel wanted.

She ‚Äújokes‚Äù about dragging me there and me and my husband will be there.

I‚Äôve had some dimensional accuracy and print in place issues, nothing serious, but more like hinges bonding together and some things not fitting sort of thing.  Was curious if a nozzle is worn out (Flash Forge Adventurer 3), and was changing filament colors and it made me wonder if I could just leave the filament harden so I could measure the purge thickness.  I measured 0.52mm and I mean, based on some of the stuff I‚Äôve seen online that might not be all that bad lol, but with me just learning was hoping to eliminate any easy problems and seemed like maybe that could have been one.  Has anyone ever looked at this measurement in relation to a new nozzle, or is there any general rules of thumb on something likely this?  I don‚Äôt see the tell tale signs that I can see, plugs, failed prints etc, but I notice some inconsistencies that I‚Äôm not liking such as print in place not really working, but prints are still doing good. However I just printed my brother an adapter for his coffee grinder, and the adapter was too tight for his catch cup, so even there, it was a simple enough print and didn‚Äôt fit‚Ä¶ somethings wrong and it‚Äôs a used printer with almost 2000 hours on it, not sure if it‚Äôs ever had a nozzle change or at least if I‚Äôm nearing the end of the second nozzles life span.

I've tried a few permutations but I still can't get it right. I'm using a DF64v2 grinder.

I'm using a medium-dark roast and the beans were roasted this month from a reputable local roaster (Tasting notes: Milk Chocolate. Muscovado. Macadamia. Dried Fruit). Temp is 88¬∞C and the grind setting is currently on 15. The pull time is 22-23 seconds and its coming out thinner and thinner but the bitterness is still there. I feel like if I grind any coarser its just going to be coffee water. I use a wdt and manual tamp.

I've tried grinding finer and pulling over 35-40 seconds and it was still bitter.

Is is possible/likely that its just the beans? I bought 1kg and I've used about half dialing in and learning. I'm open to trying a few more things before I just move to different beans.",1,1743128541.0,espresso,13,1.0,False

1jlkl6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1jlkl6k/looking_for_help_i_think/,"Looking for help, I think.","I'm at a point in my ""journey"" where I don't know where to go next. I'm currently 28, I've been in and out of therapy since I was 18. My first therapist opened me up to the concept of being abused, and that I had grown up with abusive behavior in my family. Ever since then I have been on a mission to, ""figure myself out"", so to speak. Healing the trauma, repairing what was done, and hopefully making it out on the other side, even through the grief, shame, and fear that came along with it.

I would say there are ways my mental state, my nervous system, is actually doing well, and I am in a much better state overall from where I was at not even 5 years ago. However, my biggest current problem is finding where to go next and what to do. Without revealing too much, I live in a small-ish town in Utah, I grew up Mormon, and am also gay. I lived my first 13 years in Sacramento California, then moved to where I am now, and have been living with my parents this whole time.

My biggest need, and I know this in theory, is that I need to move out, but that seems unfeasible with how I feel on a day to day basis. I think a lot of people are in the same space as I am in this sub, as I have read about how a lot of people are experiencing something very similar, and that is helpful to a degree, knowing that CPTSD is an all encompassing experience, where we can all relate to each other. However, that doesn't sort out the current situation I'm in. I feel too paralyzed to even move out of my bedroom door, let alone my whole house, where I am ""safe"" theoretically, but not safe in the ways that count completely.

I'm currently in therapy, but that doesn't get me where I would want to be, my dad is also paying for it, because I don't have a job, which I was hoping I would get a job, but realize now that unless I'm OK, I don't know if I can. I feel helpless in many ways, and have 0 clue on what to do, other than the obvious, which feel like too much for me. I also dissociate pretty awfully, it's hard for me to focus, and I don't know what to do about that either. My therapist is urging me to take steps forward, for example, do small things that would get me out of my room, something like going to a coffee shop, just being around people, where I can dip out at anytime, so if I feel overwhelmed I don't receive a heavier consequence, like a job. Am I just getting in my own way? These things feel nigh impossible.

I wanted to rant on here because I'm looking for a solution but also just to vent and have other people understand me, because even though I have been doing this ""healing"" thing for a while, there are roadblocks that I have felt that feel almost insurmountable.",1,1743128298.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

The alien ship bristled with weapon ports, sensor arrays, armored thrust nozzles and other, unknown technology. It kind of resembled a scarab, squat but round, grooves giving the ship the impression of a segmented body. It was big. Easily about 300 meters wide and 500 meters long, not including the antennae. It was obviously the command ship of the fleet, the rest of the 14 ships surrounding it a standard array of cruisers, destroyers and a pair of utility vessels. In all, it was an impressive battle group and carried more than enough firepower to glass a planet or wreck most any fleet of the galactic federation.

Captain Jon Cassilio of the *Munir Ali* stared at the viewscreen as the research vessel examined the Rayet ships. Her mission was to chart the Endas star system, soon to be renamed the Rayet system, as that is what the locals named their star.¬†

Jon‚Äôs XO Silas Abernathy sipped from his mug of coffee, watching the readings scroll across the screen. ‚ÄúFirst Contact, cap?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot for them. There‚Äôs plasma scoring on a couple of the destroyer-class ships.‚Äù

Silas raised an eyebrow, ‚Äúcould be intra-species conflict?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot likely. Their ships are armed with fusion warheads and masers. Also, see how the cruisers have disproportionally large thrusters? They‚Äôre hiding spinal-mount railguns inside them. It‚Äôs all ballistics and low-tier energy weapons. So plasma weapons are probably beyond them. No, they‚Äôve already had First Contact, and it looks like it didn‚Äôt go well for whomever they encountered.‚Äù

Silas scowled. ‚ÄúSo what do we do, Cap?‚Äù

Jon smiled wryly. ‚ÄúWhy, we‚Äôre just a friendly research vessel full of scientists representing the Solarian Research Foundation, we just wanna be friends...‚Äù

\---

*‚Äú...young slave speaker begs forgive. Instruction sequence learns from labor.‚Äù*

Admiral Biniz glared at the speaker as it spat out a clearly automated voice and bellowed, ‚Äúhow did these *aliens* learn so much of our language?‚Äù Their shoulder spines wiggled in anger.¬†

Second Technician Mat bowed, avoiding eye contact. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible they have been able to pick up industrial transmissions. They could be using an advanced computation matrix.‚Äù

Biniz turned their gaze to the technician. ‚ÄúThey learned our words in just a few cycles?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery likely, sir. And their transmission is on a common frequency. Systemnet has probably picked it up and carried it back to the homeworld.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Biniz felt the hunter‚Äôs blood rise, ‚Äúthe homeworld will see us get the aliens to surrender instead of futile combat and destruction of their flimsy ship. I think I want this computation matrix.‚Äù

*‚Äú...Admiral Kibhiz Psaadh Biniz hai Thoxikh of the Rayet 1-stroke-3 fleet. Your ship and crew are now slaves under \[untranslatable\]. Surrender all \[untranslatable\] immediately or \[untranslatable\].‚Äù*

Silas frowned. ‚ÄúWell, that doesn‚Äôt seem particularly friendly.‚Äù

Jon grinned back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been a slave before.‚Äù¬†

Silas glared, suddenly more formal. ‚ÄúCaptain, we should flee.‚Äù

Jon‚Äôs face sobered. ‚ÄúSilas, we‚Äôre hours from the jump point, even if we‚Äôre willing to burn out the reactors. While we can certainly keep out of range of their masers, and probably avoid or scramble their missile tracking, there‚Äôs no way we can avoid those railguns all the way to the jump point.‚Äù Jon locked eyes with Silas. ‚ÄúThere are better options.‚Äù

Silas held Jon‚Äôs gaze, then relented. ‚ÄúYes, Captain.‚Äù

Jon activated the comms. ‚ÄúAdmiral Kibhiz Psaadh Biniz hai Thoxikh, I‚Äôm Captain Jon Cassilio‚Ä¶‚Äù

\---

Hours had passed for Cassilio as she and the crew of the *Munir Ali* were taken aboard the alien flagship. Their vessel was brought under tow by one of the flagship *Thoxikh*‚Äôs tender ships and the entire fleet turned back toward Rayet II. The interior of the *Thoxikh* had a distinctly ultraviolet hue, causing the Solarian uniforms to fluoresce. The lights caused Jon‚Äôs injuries to look even more discolored and horrific, her blood almost black. She was missing two teeth on the right side of her mouth, and she cradled her mangled left hand.

The translation program had been running overtime since they were brought aboard, working hard to both translate and update its own language patterns. The Rayet allowed the translation program to run through Cassilio‚Äôs datacom, impressed by the advanced Solarian computer system. Near-instant translation was too useful during interrogations.



Silas had also been interrogated roughly. His left hand had been entirely removed, and the way he held his ribs indicated some were probably broken. He wheezed as he spoke. ‚ÄúCap-tain‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jon quietly looked over the rest of the crew. Most had suffered minor bruises from being pushed around by the hulking Rayet, but otherwise looked fine. However, only about two dozen were present. ‚ÄúSilas, where is everyone else?‚Äù

Silas looked away. Only one word wheezed out. ‚ÄúDissection.‚Äù

Jon clenched her good fist, but only briefly. She sighed, then turned to address the remaining crew. ‚ÄúWe have a decision to make, and it affects all of us. These Rayat are new on the galactic stage. They‚Äôre aggressive, smart, and expansionistic. They appear to have no empathy for other life, let alone sentients. They‚Äôre smart enough that even though we wiped our computers and rigged the reactors to blow should they try to start them up, they‚Äôll probably get a significant technological jump from studying our ship.‚Äù

The crew nodded, their faces serious. Silas coughed wetly and spat reddish foam onto the floor, as if punctuating the Captain‚Äôs words.

‚ÄúThere is no escape. They‚Äôre a slaver empire and they‚Äôve built these prisons with that in mind. We‚Äôre certainly being monitored now, and even without our translator running, they‚Äôre sure to have some idea what we‚Äôre talking about, so we don‚Äôt have much longer to talk. The question we need to decide, right now‚Ä¶‚Äù Captain Jon Cassilio‚Äôs expression became rock hard. ‚Äú...is how much we‚Äôre willing to suffer before the end?‚Äù

The rest of the Solarians‚Äô expressions turned just as grim and determined as the Captain‚Äôs.

\---

The Solarian jump point monitoring platform was well-hidden from any prying eyes - built for stealth and quietly holding station about 5 light-minutes from the jump point. Close enough to have excellent readouts of anything coming through while not intruding on the official Galactic Republic monitoring platforms.¬†

When the *Munir Ali‚Äôs* disaster buoy popped out of the jump point, it executed its instructions perfectly. In the wash of radiation that accompanied a jump transit, the buoy launched a stealth drone, practically invisible to the Republic‚Äôs sensors. The stealth drone turned, fired its thrusters and flew straight to the secret monitoring station.¬†

The disaster buoy was scooped up by the Republic platform, dutifully reporting a terrible accident that led to all hands lost. Reactor breaches were not unheard of, and when they occurred, there was rarely anything more than scattered atoms and radiation left over. It was why disaster buoys were invented in the first place.



While the Republic mourned the loss of a peaceful Solarian research vessel, the real message was delivered. A recording of the *Munir Ali‚Äôs* First Contact with the Rayet. A dangerous, aggressive new species that left unchecked, could bring the Republic to its knees. Sensor logs, translation matrices, technological readouts, and every excruciating second of the crew‚Äôs interrogation at the hands of the Rayet. It amounted to their epitaph, a recording of their sacrifice to gather every last piece of intelligence on the Rayet. An epitaph to be quietly filed away in the archives of the Solarian Research Foundation while they decided¬† what was to be done about the Rayet. An epitaph that would never be seen by the galaxy at large.",7,1743128135.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,0.9,False
