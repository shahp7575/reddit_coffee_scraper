1llmqsb,https://i.redd.it/gzl51kuzwe9f1.jpeg,AIO I want to return a ‚Äúgift‚Äù from my dad,"My dad and I share a lot of personality traits, so we can bicker pretty often. While he and my brother had flown out to help me build a deck at our home, this was all mostly fine until after my brother left, while my dad stayed, relocating himself from a hotel to our extra bedroom where my brother had been sleeping.

Besides continuously fighting to try to get my dad to respect our basic house rules (no shoes in the house; whisper near the baby room when the baby is asleep; no continuous phone use or screens near the baby - basic stuff), he started doing things that I found unacceptable, even when I would ask him not to.

Examples: throwing our hardwood decking boards onto the gravel after I asked him not to; throwing our belongings away, even after asking him to ask us first.

After convincing my wife (34W) and me that we should plant a tree in our front yard, I awoke the next morning to the skid steer I had rented being driven to the front yard. 

This was a (normal) work day for me, so I really could not do much work outside. I was already upset that he was using the machine without talking to me at all; had started digging a hole in our front yard without talking to my wife and me; and stressed bc I had a lot of work to do and operating that machine isn‚Äôt really something my dad should be doing anyway. When I went outside, I asked my dad to please not do too much, and not to tear up the grass (which a skid steer is wont to do).

After coming back from the coffee shop, I asked him to please stop digging. He didn‚Äôt want to stop. I got angry and said he should listen to what I am trying to tell him about our (my wife‚Äôs and my) own yard. He continued digging for the next 5 hours.

Eventually, he convinced my wife (34W) and my mother-in-law to go out with my daughter (13 months), to a tree farm an hour away. It was 101 degrees outside, so it was a long day to find a tree. He kept insisting it was a gift, so we went along with it and tried to make the day fun.

After we found a tree, we went to get lunch. My dad (67M), had 3 drinks and was obviously tipsy. No one else drank alcohol. We (wife, MIL, myself) were all mostly focused on the baby, who is tough to keep entertained, clean, and safe, while out and about.

When we got home, my dad made it clear that he did not want to pay the tree farm people to plant the 2,000-pound tree he got ‚Äúon sale.‚Äù He wanted me to ‚Äúfigure out‚Äù how to plant it.

I just want to return the thing, rather than renting expensive equipment, paying people, and working myself harder than I already do, to plant this tree.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for just over two years now (our anni was April 29th WOOO!) I would say we're in a very healthy relationship and are able to communicate about anything under the sun. One thing we do seem to disagree on is who pays for what. For context, I make a little better money then him, we both live with our parents (no rent), we pay for our cars ourselves, and we're fortunate to not have tooo many crazy expenses. When we go out, we're pretty much always splitting the bill. And if we're not splitting the bill, I'm usually paying for both of us just because I hate splitting the bill! Now and then, he'll pay for our lil treats, coffees, and (always) days like my bday. But on the regular, we are both paying for our own stuff. Am I wrong for wanting him to pay for more? I understand that we're both young, he's not super wealthy and we do want to save for our futures. However, I've always believed the man should take initiative and be in his masculine energy and pay for the girlll to allow her to be in her feminine?? Especially when he invites me on a date...and then we end up splitting the bill.

Okay let me give you a scenario, it's our TWO YEAR anniversary and we have a day jam packed with activities. We split every single bill. We went to JOLLIBEE and I still ended up e-transfering him...And that's one thing, I don't mind paying for my own stuff most of the time! But on a special day like that? And yes, this specific day is to celebrate both of us buttt I make it clear all the time that I rather cover both our bills then split 50/50 like we're roommates! 

We've been over this topic so many times that we came to the conclusion that in the future - he's made it clear that when he does have the money, he plans to spoil me all the time. So that's reassuring I think?

I do truly think we're a good match and he would make an excellent life partner. I'm just worried that I'll end up resenting him because of this, and I already find myself being petty about it without intending to.

1llmj0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1llmj0v/first_experience_with_colon_prep_laxatives/,"First Experience with colon prep laxatives, sedation and endo+colonoscopy","TLDR: These procedures turned out to be a piece of cake, nothing like the horror show my anxiety was imagining. I'm glad I did it, got my results and peace of mind. There's nothing to worry about!


I decided to post this because I have a lot of anxiety about the unknown and I've been using reddit a lot in the past few months to read others' personal experiences with everything I've been going through. If you've got anxiety about these things too, I hope this is somewhat comforting. 

About a year ago I started having weird, flat shaped poops, or sometimes floating, light colored stool and very often diarrhea. I started trying to find what could be causing this and of course the internet told me: cancer. I found many similar looking pictures on reddit from other people's experiences with ibs, ibd, colon cancer and more. So, I went to a GI, had a stool test as well as blood work up. Everything came back normal so I ignored it for a few more months until about two months ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and given 6 months to live, just out of nowhere. Obviously this scared the crap out of me so I decided to demand a CT scan and endoscopy + colonoscopy to see what was going on. 

Again, I get really anxious about these things and looked to reddit for stories about how everything feels, and got some kind of mixed results which didn't exactly ease my mind. So I'll give you my take.  Let's start with the colonoscopy prep - I took the prescribed laxative Suflave which consists of two bottles of product and flavor packets. Most people online were only complaining about the flavor and not the effects of the product, but I was more worried about literally shitting my brains out because the package comes with an enormous pamphlet about potential severe side effects like seizures, abnormal heart beats, vomiting, etc. I have to say I was almost disappointed at how mellow the entire experience was! It was nothing like what I had built up in my anxiety riddled brain. The flavor was fine. Salty, weak flavored Gatorade. It's not something you'd drink by choice, but far from disgusting or gag worthy. The feeling was minimal. No stomach cramping, no nausea. Even the poos it induced were pretty tame. I've had worse squirts from a night out drinking or even a morning coffee. I probably went to the bathroom once every 30 minutes for about 2 hours. I already use a bidet so I never worry about tearing up my brown eye. Most inconvenient part was needing to do the second bottle at 3am. I didn't sleep much, but whatever. 

Next, I was nervous about the oscopies and anesthesia. Was it going to hurt afterwards? Would I remember anything? What if I panicked when getting the drugs? Again, my anxiety built this all up into a much bigger deal than it ended up being. Sitting in my hospital gown, IV already hooked up to a saline drip I had some 30 minutes to continue worrying before actually being taken back. This was the worst part. When they did finally take me back, everything happened quickly - I needed to roll on to my side, the anesthesiologist hooked up to the IV that was already in place and they began immediately. I remember about 2 seconds of feeling the sedation. I started to feel a little lightheaded and sleepy (but no panic) and then nothing. I had some dreams even, but I can't remember them now of course. Next thing I know I woke up in the recovery room. There was no pain at all in either my throat or bum. The only remaining effects were feeling a little dizzy for another hour or so. 

They gave me results right away: no cancer! No polyps or anything to report from the colonoscopy. From the endoscopy they found inflammation (gastritis) in my esophagus, stomach and the mouth of the stomach. They took some biopsies which I will have to wait for results about. They say it could be caused by H. Pylori bacteria. Otherwise I may need to just start changing things in my diet. But in the end, all these strange poop symptoms I've been worrying about for a year turned out to be harmless and the peace of mind is worth the cost of the procedures. 

Anyway, hope this might help to ease the mind of anyone else with anxiety that is looking to go through these procedures. Good luck!",2,1751004266.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

First, I wish to apologize for my English ‚Äì it is not my first language, obviously. 
    At the start of this year, I started attending trainings in this little medieval reenactment group. As someo who adores history, the aesthetic, swords, etc, I was thrilled! I dropped from Kendo before, because everyone was pressuring me into screaming and I was not comfortable with that. 
    But the more trainings I attended, one of our ""trainers""(he's more of a veteran passing down his knowledge, if that makes sense) started having unnecessary comments about me. I told him about my anxiety, my ADHD, my disability pension and all. He was understanding, and yet he cannot help himself and say stuff like: ""What's wrong? You look so sad?""
""Why are you sitting on the bench again?""
""You're tired already? Maybe you should start drinking coffee before training!""
""You should go in front of the men and assert dominance as a strong woman and talk more!""
""Look who's smiling finally!"" 
   Sure, he's probably trying to encourage me, but it puts pressure on me and makes me feel as if I'm not appreciated for who I am, and for the fact that I'm trying as much as I can. 
    To go to the main problem ‚Äì I just feel as if I don't fit in much. Sure, there's this sweet girl who talks to me. But when her friend is present, they always form a group, and I'm stuck with the trainer for the day, usually. It just reminds me of middle school how no one wanted me in there team during PE. 
   Plus I overthinking a lot! I don't understand something, get confused, make a Mistake and I immediately think to myself 'wow! Bravo Nat, they think you're stupid!' 
    Well, today it was only five of us plus someone who never was training us before. The rest of the group went on this thing. I was absent for a month, lack of motivation and my father was hospitalized for a few days. I finally managed to gather courage to go today. Felt great, happy even. Put on light makeup,dressed cute, took a few selfie, which happens rarely. But once I arrived, I was feeling anxious. I even started seeing double. And when we had to do something Infront of everyone individually, I just apologized and sat on the bench.  Then, I did something again later and went back in the bench. Was overwhelmed from the trainer's dog running around, demanding its owner's attention, everyone talking loudly, swords catching. I can handle it most of the time, but couldn't handle it today.
    Then, this one guy suddenly says to Mey for everyone to hear: ""you do know you can go home? No one is forcing you to be here... looking so gloomy and all."" (I was not even feeling tad bit sad üò≠). So I was like: ""oh... right. Yeah, I'll go,"" and stood up. The trainer seemed confused and reassured me that the boy didn't mean it like that, but since I was on the verge of crying I just made up an excuse saying: ""No, it's okay. I'll go, my father will be picking me up in, like, 15 minutes."" 
    Went to the dressroom to change and cried a little. I don't know, I suddenly felt so unwelcomed. Especially when the nice girl didn't even say anything. I don't know...",1,1751004008.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

I have seen here how when I acknowledge someone with ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù, ‚ÄúIsthuthi‚Äù or ‚ÄúBohoma Isthuthi‚Äù, the person gives a genuine smile or nod, and frankly I haven‚Äôt seen others do this much at all, especially conveying their thanks to service providers they view ‚Äúbelow‚Äù them. 
Please kindly remember that the people you interact with are also human - thank the door attendant, shop keeper, waitress/waiter, parking attendant, checkout cashier, lavatory cleaner, etc. Even a smile goes a long way when people are constantly ignored by others. A test of your character is how you treat others. 

2) If you‚Äôre sitting at a table, please push your chair in before you leave. Maybe this particularly grates me as someone who worked in food hospitality in my youth. 

3) The amount of added sugar in regular foods is crazy (perhaps I notice this as someone who tries to eat low sugar foods). E.g. tea, coffee, jaggery to sweeten so many foods, traditional sweets, breakfast items, banis, bread, juice, etc. 
I fully recognise this is absolutely a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem. 

4) It‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable when men gawk at you, honk their vehicles, lustfully look at you up and down, etc., even when you‚Äôre walking with your parents and wearing modest cloths. 
Young boys try to shyly make eye contact while uncles make it more obvious by straight-out leering. I can understand that some people are genuinely looking to get to know someone without being off-putting and creepy, so perhaps as a married women, this makes me uncomfortable. 
I also think that some men fetishise lighter skinned women. 

5) Speaking of, internalised racism in the difference between treating dark skinned people vs light skinned people is extremely disheartening to see. When with family members, I‚Äôve felt the difference in customer service, general attitude, exchanging of pleasantries, even speaking in English, etc. while deeper toned people are ignored. 

Please share your thoughts, opinions, experiences, feel free to roast me or educate me, etc. Happy to have a conversation below.",6,1751003919.0,srilanka,1,0.8,False
1llmfcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1llmfcw/really_trying_to_understand_if_no_contact_is/,Really trying to understand if no contact is right for me,"so my ex broke up with me about two months ago. For lack of a better term, she found out that I was emotionally cheating about one year and into our relationship. We had been dating for four years. I did not have the tools nor was I committed enough at the time of my mistakes. I‚Äôm very regretful and obviously if I could go back in time and change that I would. we were working through trust issues that she had probably from previous trauma, and these texts from 2-3 years ago were the ‚Äònail in the coffin‚Äô

Just so you know, I texted another girl and told her that I was single and asked her to hang out. The texts suck, and i feel horrible for treating my girlfriend like that. she did not deserve it and i actually planned to ask her to marry me in the last year or so. the reason i didn‚Äôt was because she had told me that she still didn‚Äôt fully trust me. no cheating has or has ever happened, but these texts were not good and i didnt have the tools to deal with my emotions at the time, nor was i equipped to communicate with her openly. i have done so much work the past 2 months though, and i would love nothing more than to share all of these new tools and ‚Äònew‚Äô me with her. i know i am going to be so much better equipped for my next relationship, either way!

anyway, I‚Äôve been doing a ton of introspection and learning. I learned that I definitely was a high functioning codependent. I also learned that I probably wasn‚Äôt giving her the emotional space that she needed. And during this time, one of her family members that was really close to her passed away . I think that part of being the high functioning codependent issue that it was going on was that I was so empathetic that I would take her feelings away from her, feel them myself, and then try to fix everything right away. Another example of high functioning codependency is trying to fix everything right away and not ever actually listening (in other words, auto advice giving - it is not cool and im glad i learned it, i just wish i learned earlier. i get it from my dad i think). 

This may sound extreme, but it‚Äôs the type of thing you do when you just give advice when people probably don‚Äôt actually want it. I‚Äôve been working on that a lot lately. I think it does lead to distrust and resentment for a number of reasons. 

anyway, I keep getting really strong desires to text her and just ask her to coffee. I want to tell her all the exciting things I‚Äôve learned, and I don‚Äôt really even have expectations to get back with her. She told me that she needs space, so I‚Äôm trying to respect that and I have respected that for over a month and a half. 

I‚Äôm definitely going through it and probably just analyzing this so much about 20 to 30% of my day. 

I asked the universe for a sign and weirdly enough, I watched a TV show where a guy had called his ex to get her back because someone else in the show told him to ‚Äògo get what he wants‚Äô and I don‚Äôt know that probably doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with it, but it definitely sparked an interest. its the first tv ive watched in 3 weeks probably weirdly enough. 

I literally told myself today that I was gonna wait to contact for two more weeks though. I have a feeling that she would reach out if I waited the two weeks anyway so I think I‚Äôm going to wait. But that‚Äôs the thing.. I‚Äôm waiting, also healing, but also waiting‚Ä¶ 

anyway, I can‚Äôt tell if no contact is right, but she did ask for space so I‚Äôm trying to respect that. Any thoughts are appreciated!",1,1751003885.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

    At the start of this year, I started attending trainings in this little medieval reenactment group. As someo who adores history, the aesthetic, swords, etc, I was thrilled! I dropped from Kendo before, because everyone was pressuring me into screaming and I was not comfortable with that. 
    But the more trainings I attended, one of our ""trainers""(he's more of a veteran passing down his knowledge, if that makes sense) started having unnecessary comments about me. I told him about my anxiety, my ADHD, my disability pension and all. He was understanding, and yet he cannot help himself and say stuff like: ""What's wrong? You look so sad?""
""Why are you sitting on the bench again?""
""You're tired already? Maybe you should start drinking coffee before training!""
""You should go in front of the men and assert dominance as a strong woman and talk more!""
""Look who's smiling finally!"" 
   Sure, he's probably trying to encourage me, but it puts pressure on me and makes me feel as if I'm not appreciated for who I am, and for the fact that I'm trying as much as I can. 
    To go to the main problem ‚Äì I just feel as if I don't fit in much. Sure, there's this sweet girl who talks to me. But when her friend is present, they always form a group, and I'm stuck with the trainer for the day, usually. It just reminds me of middle school how no one wanted me in there team during PE. 
   Plus I overthinking a lot! I don't understand something, get confused, make a Mistake and I immediately think to myself 'wow! Bravo Nat, they think you're stupid!' 
    Well, today it was only five of us plus someone who never was training us before. The rest of the group went on this thing. I was absent for a month, lack of motivation and my father was hospitalized for a few days. I finally managed to gather courage to go today. Felt great, happy even. Put on light makeup,dressed cute, took a few selfie, which happens rarely. But once I arrived, I was feeling anxious. I even started seeing double. And when we had to do something Infront of everyone individually, I just apologized and sat on the bench.  Then, I did something again later and went back in the bench. Was overwhelmed from the trainer's dog running around, demanding its owner's attention, everyone talking loudly, swords catching. I can handle it most of the time, but couldn't handle it today.
    Then, this one guy suddenly says to Mey for everyone to hear: ""you do know you can go home? No one is forcing you to be here... looking so gloomy and all."" (I was not even feeling tad bit sad üò≠). So I was like: ""oh... right. Yeah, I'll go,"" and stood up. The trainer seemed confused and reassured me that the boy didn't mean it like that, but since I was on the verge of crying I just made up an excuse saying: ""No, it's okay. I'll go, my father will be picking me up in, like, 15 minutes."" 
    Went to the dressroom to change and cried a little. I don't know, I suddenly felt so unwelcomed. Especially when the nice girl didn't even say anything. I don't know...",1,1751003805.0,NeedToTalk,1,1.0,False

I have never worked at US and Canada companies before. Recently, applied for jobs in Canada and US. I know Canada job market really crazy right now but US is also similar. 

My background is I have many years of experience in tech and have previously worked with UK , Australia and Singapore companies. I never seen such long interviews here before. It really shocked me. 

I'm sad to see that Lot of interviewers are making lot of money by spending lot of time with Candidates. They wasted lot of candidates time meanwhile they're paid to interview people. Most interviews have at least 3 rounds of interviews and 5-6 rounds of interviews are also common too. And, you'll likely even get rejected after going 5-6 rounds of interviews. Interviews are also very long at least 1 hour. Take home challenge also very common. The ones u need to take 1-2 days to complete. Cognitive skills assessment, IQ tests, personality and behavior tests, Vibe check test, coffee interviews. OMG! At the end, they will say sorry to you and they hire someone they know lol.

I'm sorry to say that it's not common in UK, Singapore and Australia. You are likely to get offer after going through final rounds of interviews. Maximum round of interviews here is 3. I had never had  4 round of interviews in my 10+ years of career. I have some mates from Japan too. It's same as UK, Singapore and Australia.

I know economy is bad and unemployment rate is high. Japan and Singapore has low unemployment rate. But don't blame the economy and please do something positive. Lot of people in Canada and US are struggling and many are jobless. All thanks to complex interviews and ATS system/insert your Advanced AI recruiting system LOL",1,1751003683.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

They never answered why they did this, despite you asking many times. Until today.","Have you ever seen that cliche in an anime where a person freezes after being slashed by a sword? You know, where it looks like the sword went through the person, while the attacker slowly pushes the sword into its scabbard, while muttering something like. ‚ÄúHeh, nothing personal.‚Äù Before, a spattering of blood pours out from the victim‚Äôs chest. Well, my situation‚Äôs kind of like that, without the excessive blood and swords.

I was waiting for the 7:30pm train after work, only for some jackass to shove me, telling me I was in his spot on the bench. So, I politely told him to shove his spot up his ass, and because of that innocent comment, he wanted to clock me in the face. He readied up a punch, his meaty biceps straining beneath his hotdog-stained sleeves, ready to take my head off, only for his hand to twist behind his back before I could even get disturbed by the breeze generated from his swing.

The man yelped, bouncing on the spot, trying to untangle himself from the invisible attacker. In response, I pulled out my phone, giving it a disinterested scroll, before turning to the lady next to me. ‚ÄúWhy does this station always get the weirdo‚Äôs?‚Äù I muttered to her, playing the part of an innocent bystander who had no idea what this insane man was doing.

He bucked his legs, as if he were a wild horse, though that bucking action only got him thrown to the floor, chin scrapping against the hard surface. ‚ÄúFuck. Why can‚Äôt I get up?‚Äù He squirmed, and before I could answer him, the train came. So, I stepped onto his back, climbing over his body, before getting onto it. As the train doors shut, I saw my knight, the tiny four-foot creature dressed in heavy blue armor, with a symbol of a curved dagger on his chest plate. It was amazing how the dagger symbol had a glow to it, as if that part sparkled more than the rest of his incredibly shiny armor. I gave him a nod as we left the station.

I didn‚Äôt know who he was, simply calling him nighty, as I couldn‚Äôt pronounce the silent K when I was a child. I had known him for at least twenty-three years now, the knight saving me from all manner of problems. He even once stopped a car with his armored body acting as a tiny bollard. Though, despite having known him for such a long time, we had never exchanged words.

Not that I never tried, he just never responded to anything I said. At first, I thought it was because he was the dark, brooding type that preferred to keep up their mysterious appearance, but now. Now, I wondered if they couldn‚Äôt speak at all. Returning home from work, I tossed my bag aside, watching it bump into my cabinet, knocking over a family photo.

‚ÄúStrike.‚Äù I said, without a lick of enthusiasm. Collecting the photo, I set it back on the cabinet, finding my gaze lingering on their faces. ‚ÄúI really should call them.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt believe in signs, but seeing the photo tumble off the shelf seemed as close to one as I would get. I hadn‚Äôt seen any of them since I came to the city, telling myself I would call them when I wasn‚Äôt busy, as if that was an excuse. Even my older brother, who I used to idolize, barely got a second thought now.

Dropping onto the couch, I went to watch some tv, only to find myself in a pickle. I wanted to watch the tv, but the remote was all the way on the coffee table. That meant I either had to bend my decaying twenty-three-year-old body over or call for some help. ‚ÄúNighty, can you pass the remote?‚Äù

The tiny knight appeared and grabbed the remote. For a second, it felt like he was going to pass it to me, only for the knight to hold it centimeters from my reach, forcing me to bend forward to get it. The joints in my back cracking from the basic movement, with those few years of sitting in an office already doing wonders to deteriorate my health. Taking the remote from him, I gave a sarcastic. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes thou not miss their kin?‚Äù He said, in a high-pitched squeaky tone.

‚ÄúYou can talk?‚Äù I dropped the remote, scrambling off the couch, and onto my knees, kneeling before the knight who shyly stepped back, perhaps not enjoying having the person he was serving kneeling before him.

He knelt too, as if we were playing some weird version of limbo where you had to get the closest to the floor without a bar being involved. I instinctively lowered again, and by the end of our impromptu game, we were both on our stomachs. ‚ÄúOf course, I can speak. Any knight worth their armor can speak common tongue.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just you never have before. Um, nighty. I wanted to thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for me.‚Äù I said, wanting to tell him how much he meant to me before he went back to his silence, fearing it could happen at any moment.

‚ÄúCease thy attempts at thanks, my lord. Nighty doth only his duty.‚Äù The small knight crossed his arm over his chest, resting it proudly against the dagger on his armor.

‚ÄúUm, thanks ceased?‚Äù I said, not wanting to insult him with my praise. ‚ÄúSo, why are you helping me?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause thou are the truth king, my lord. Heir to your family‚Äôs throne.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a throne. We have a rocking chair, but that‚Äôs dads. I guess I might inherit it someday.‚Äù

‚ÄúThou were once a powerful bloodline, and my family swore we would always ensure your safety.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be following my older brother, then? Isn‚Äôt he the heir? Or what about my dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour father hath past his prime, thou are the lord now. As for your older brother, he is the first-born son, whose duties are more focused on defending the family‚Äôs honor in times of war. You are the one to inherit the throne.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, my brother is expected to go to war for our kingdom? Do we have enemies?‚Äù I asked, wondering if that man from the train station counted as an enemy.

‚ÄúIndeed, my lord. Thou‚Äôs family hath been feuding with the Minialo‚Äôs bloodline for hundreds of years.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, Minialo? Like Daisy Minialo from my work? The one that stole all my staples and then claimed I hadn‚Äôt brought any. That snake?‚Äù Just the thought of her made me mildly annoyed. Not annoyed enough to care too greatly about her misdeeds, just enough that I might give her the cold shoulder if she said hi to me when we passed in the office.

The knight tensed, body shaking with contained rage. ‚ÄúThat same scoundrel. For years your families hath waged war, though both kingdoms hath fallen since.‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew there was a reason I didn‚Äôt like her.‚Äù I smacked my hands together, happy my hatred came from a feud between our ancestors, instead of something as petty as staples. Even if the staples were what had initially started my leg of the feud. ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you spoken to me before now?‚Äù

‚ÄúThou shouldn‚Äôt get comfortable communing with spirits. It only brings misery, my lord. Thou missed their family. I wished to offer comfort.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank you. I feel a lot better now. Would you like to watch some tv?‚Äù I offered, patting the spot next to me on the couch. Nighty glanced at the spot, adjusting his helmet as he considered it before facing away.

‚ÄúNay. I must be on my way. Good morrow, my lord, I shall see thee again soon.‚Äù And he vanished, leaving me staring at the blank tv screen. I waited a moment until I was certain he had actually left, before putting on the tv, leaning into my couch. No matter how much I tried, I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable, a nagging feeling in my chest stopping me from relaxing. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt leave unless I made the call, so I got out my phone, entering my parents‚Äô number.",2,1751003335.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

Mike was currently staring off at the place where the sun had set. he was still sitting with Foxy curled up against him, sleeping soundlessly. not a sound escaped his small stature. the only sound that permeated the surroundings was the sound of the waves crashing against the boat softly. it was so silent in fact that when the sound of sandals hitting wood entered the dock, Mike heard it as if it was the loudest of music.

""Beanie."" he greeted without even looking back. the purple bunny chuckled before sitting down besides him and looking out at the starry sky. well, it wasn't so starry, as the last lights of the sun still influenced the sky, turning it, ironically, purple. or pink? maybe magenta? finally, Beanie turned to her fiend, and her much smaller fox friend.

""you two are going to catch a cold at this rate. the party's not over just yet, but.."" she started, before turning her eyes back up to the sky ""i can sort of see why you're out here."" Mike let out a soft laugh at her words before turning his eyes back up to the sky.

""you should have seen it. Foxy had probably the most lucid moment he's had since I've known him. and he didn't even have a single word."" Mike said. Beanie looked over at him with a slightly surprised gaze before glancing at the red fur ball at his side and then smiling

""well, lucid moments or not, we don't want you two getting sick. c'mon."" Beanie said. she stood up and dusted non-existent dust from her pants. she extended a hand to Mike, who took it, but not before shaking Foxy awake (presumably so he doesn't fall.)

""yeah. lets go, first mate Foxy, wouldn't want you getting a cold."" Mike said, pulling the fox up to his feet. the red sailor wannabe stood on shaky feet for a second before scampering to the door and inside the cruise's main room, with all the party goers. Mike and Beanie shared a look of amusement before following the trail of comically kicked up dust.

they walked in silence for a few moments, hand in hand (Beanie insisted cuz it was cold) before Mike noticed something. he was hearing.. static? glitching? he poked his free pinky finger into his ear in an effort to clear whatever bug had obviously flown in, to no success. he turned to Beanie and opened his mouth to ask.

¬†

he jerked his hand back and blinked twice, but Beanie was looking perfectly normal again. she paused and looked at him oddly before cracking a grin and raising an eyebrow

""what? flustered by¬†*holding hands*? how would you ever handle having a girlfriend?"" she teases. Mike looked at her for a second of hesitation before exhaling a breath he didn't even know he was holding. he then smirked and decided to get back at her for her tease

""says the girl who's cheeks are litterally blushed pink."" he joked. at his words Beanie actually developed a blush, not changing her features too much but it was there and her expression was also a dead give away as she tried to cover up her cheeks quickly and turn away from him

""thats just how my face is!"" she yells in embarrassment. Mike could have pushed it further, but he decided that it would only end up with potential bodily harm. he stopped slouching and stood at his full height (about a foot taller than Beanie if one were to not count her ears) and patted her head lightly. she turned her flushed face up to him in confusion

""just pushing your buttons. but it is getting cold, and i left my jacket in my bag."" Mike said. he went on ahead, motioning for Beanie to follow him. she took a moment to touch her head where he had¬†*pet*¬†her, and smiled. no one had done that for her for a while. not since she left home, anyways. she quickly caught up to him and followed him inside.

¬†

""mister Schmidt!"" Mike turned around at those words. there was only one person who called him that and had that tone of voice. looked up to look at the slim figure of the owner of his apartment complex. ""how are you enjoying the evening so far? this long winded party is the last event of the night, so i would hope so!""

""yeah, its nice. real high-energy vibes, you know? clashes well with all that happened."" Mike agreed. looking around, he noted that the blunt of his friends had grouped up into different sets, with the exception of several who were walking around the room. Faz was still in those same captain garbs, and he had even put on a pirate hat. where the hell did he get that?

""excellent. oh! have you been informed when the next S n' S game night will be held?"" the spindly man asked. he was clearly excited, but Mike remembered something at that moment.

""ah, it might not be for a while. Beanie's a professional SM now, so it would have to be at a time where the shop she does it at isn't opened."" Mike explains, rubbing the back of his head and offering and apologetic smile. the landlord dressed in Hawaiian sighed in disappointment, but shot his head up as an idea his him

""oh! i know! we could host it as an event for Christmas or Halloween! now that the community is growing, so is my budget! i can finally start hosting events for everyone!"" he cheered, waving his arms in the air. he hiccupped and started to fall back, but was caught by brown arms.

""this guy's had one too many. hides it well, but the effects are there."" Fred chuckled good naturedly. his attire was such a stark contrast to what everyone else was wearing that Mike was surprised he didn't notice him approach.

""no kidding. didn't even slur his words once.."" Mike muttered, looking at the passed out man apprehensively. the larger man laughed and set Marion down onto a chair before turning his attention to the new security guard. they sat through a few moments of awkward silence before Fred cracked a grin

""you're definitely looking thinner than before."" he joked. Mike groaned and patted his much slimmer stomach. he had lost weight, but not exactly in the way he had wanted.

""nothing but nutrient juice and mush filling your stomach for the entire summer will do that to ya."" he grumbled. his nutritious balance was stable, but he was still pretty worn out and hungry from just the day's activities. hopefully, now that he was permitted by the hospital to do so, eating some of Freddy's home cooking could cure his lamentable condition.

""ah, lighten up, there's plenty of snacks!"" Fred laughed, holding a platter of ham-cheese on skewers from out of nowhere (actually, he took it from a table while Mike was busy brooding about his lost weight). Mike sweat dropped but took a skewer none the less, biting into it.

""thanks.""

¬†

""..and so thats when- oh! Mike, dearie. i haven't seen you since earlier."" Mangle said as Mike approached the table she, (a very drunk)Bonbon and Goose were conversing.

""what can i say? that was a good sunset."" Mike explained with a shrug, taking a seat next to Bonbon. ""so, what's the sauce this time?""

""Foxglove was 'hic!'.. just telling us a funny shtoreeey."" Bonbon giggled. yeah, she was way too drunk. can someone get that girl a coffee? no? fine, i'll do it myself. no one payed any mind as a cup of iced coffee appeared on the table, right in front of Bonbon.

""right, so i've recently gotten a recurring customer. she goes by VanTrap101, and she just¬†**adores**¬†my works. I've sent her some samples, and i do believe she's more than eager to purchase some more."" Mangle explained with a barely hidden grin

""i see. im happy you're Clothier business is still going well."" Mike said. Mangle giggles and takes a sip of tea. Mike looked at her questioningly, nut it just caused another fit of giggles from the slim fox

""she was particularly impressed with the articles you modeled. you've definitely got an admirer\~"" she teased. Mike pondered that for a moment, before shrugging. having an admirer wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as they didn't get obsessed or anything.

""alright. hey Bonbon, you might want to drink some of that coffee."" Mike mused as the electric blue bunny began to slouch more and more in her seat. she didn't say anything, instead opting to take the mug in hand and sip out of the straw. while no immediate signs of instant soberness showed themselves, she definitely looked less out-of-it.

""mm? Bonbon had coffee with her?"" Goose asked before shaking her head ""anyways, VanTrap101, right? pretty sure i recognise her tag. Beanie said she got stomped by her one time."" she explained. Mike looked thoughtful at that for a few moments before shrugging

""maybe i'll ask her about it sometime then. by the way, you know where the bathroom is?"" he asked, getting up from his seat. Bonbon took another sip of coffee and pointed to the back of the room, where Mike could barely make out a 'w/c' sign through all the colorful lights and people conversing.

he waved goodbye to the three, with Mangle being the only real one to wave back, on account of Bonbon being too drunk and Goose not even realizing he had left. he walked through the party room, weaving though and around people with various ranges of 'drunk', making sure to wave at anybody who called his name., eventually making it to the bathroom.

after doing his business and washing up, he walked out only to be greeted by a grim sight.

a desk with countless monitors.

two doors, with two buttons on each side.

a cable phone.

a purple fan.

Mike began to sweat. he knew this wasn't real, it litterally couldn't be. he just left the god damn bathroom. so why was he here, in this damned office? same reason he always ended up in his past.

hallucinations.

""*calm down, Mike. its not real. just close your eyes and breath.*"" he thought to himself, doing as he said he would. he breathed deeply and mentally counted to ten.

""Michael! are you alright?""

Mike opened his eyes and saw April. he sighed and nodded, forcing himself to put on a smile

""yeah, i just spaced out for a minute. were you.. trying to get my attention for something?"" he asked once he was composed enough for his smile to be mostly real. April frowned, crossing her arms

""well, i see you standing in front of the bathroom doors, all blank faced. what am i supposed to think?"" she asked rhetorically. Mike let his smile drop alongside his arms, leaving them to his sides. he sighed and motioned for April to listen closly. she obliged.

""every now and then, once a week at the very maximum, i still get hallucinations. they're much more obvious now, and i get out of them much faster, but the thing is that they blend seamlessly into what i was doing beforehand.."" he whispers. April nods sympathetically

""you're traumatized, Mike. its incredible you came out of that experience without turning out like Bonnibel."" she started, running her paw through her head fur ""its more surprising you don't have them more often than once a week. thats some serious mental fortitude."" she finished, patting Mike on the back lightly.

"" 'sigh', maybe i should see a psychiatrist."" Mike said. April nodded in approval, moving slightly back to give the human some space

""thats always a good idea, no matter what situation you're in. no one would look at you lesser if you did.""

""yeah. you're right.""

¬†

""Chichi, Rackham, Bonnibel. hey."" Mike greeted as he approached the table, with them waving back to him. as he approached, he noticed a small blue rabbit. that girl, Fran's son, right? what was his name again.. ""and Bonson.""

the blue rabbit was engrossed in his portable game console, offering a single grunt as acknowledgment that he was there. the¬†*other*¬†blue rabbit was much more vocal in her greeting

""hi Mike! where've you been?"" she asked, sitting up from her seat and leaning her paws on the table

""i was watching the sunset with Haddock. sadly i didn't.. hold on.."" Mike started, bringing out his phone (he got one as a get well gift from Fred, the absolute legend) and checking out something ""aha! i accidentally left my phone on record. i think i was just meant to capture a quick video of Haddock chasing his tail earlier, but it was left on until now. i'll cut them into a couple videos and send them to Chicklet, Fred, Beanie, Bonbon and probably Bonworth."" he explains. Chichi gets up from her chair in a flash and grabs Mike's phone, swiping until she got to the scene where Haddock was chasing his tail

""aawww! Foxy, Bonnibel, look at this!"" she squealed as she held the phone up to their faces. Bonnibel giggled and Rackham snickered at the sight

""i would almost be offended if this wasn't so funny."" the fox said between snickers. Bonnibel was too busy giggling to make any vocal notes of it.

the sight of Haddock running in circles, snapping at his tail for over 3 minutes was truly a sight to behold.

""alright, enough messing with my phone. ask Beanie later, she'll have it in her Harmony(discord equivalent) messages. anyways, me and Haddock were watching the sunset and kind of got immersed."" Mike said, grabbing his phone and pocketing it.

""oooh, i'll definitely need to get that! i love looking at sunsets!"" Chichi chirped happily. Bonnibel nodded in agreement, sitting back down and taking a bite out of what appeared to be a glazed carrot muffin

Mike also took a seat and picked out a muffin from the platter on the table. there were several kinds, and he happened to pick out a blueberry muffin.

taking a bite, he leaned back and closed his eyes, savoring the flavor. it was pretty good. Rackham coughed slightly, catching Mikes attention

""so Mike, got any plans this weekend?"" he asked, subtly bringing out a deck of cards. Mike chuckled at his obvious invitation to go play poker, but unfortunate for him,

""yeah, sorry. i already said i'd watch this new cartoon, '*Bobby and the pink machine*', with Bonbon. apparently, they used rubber hose art style, and while it's not my¬†*preferred*¬†style, i'm willing to give it a shot."" Mike said, much to the disappointment of Rackham. then, as if struck by a lightbulb, he opened his mouth and raised his finger, but another voice beat him to his turn to talk

""Mike starts Monday, so he's got to use Sunday to prepare, mentally and physically."" Beanie said, leaning on Mike's chair from behind

""oohh.."" Rackham whined, dejected. Chichi patted his back comfortingly, prompting him to look up at her

""its alright, i'll play poker with you on the weekend."" she assured, smiling brightly. foxy turned around to hide his blush, but smiled anyways.

Beanie propped herself back up onto her feet and swiped off imaginary dust from her hoodie. she looked to Mike and put her hands in her pockets, feigning disinterest.

""so Mike.. Marion was saying something about budgets and events.. know anything about that?"" she asked, barely restraining an excited grin

""oh yeah. he asked about the next S n' S game, and when i said you would be working most days, he rambled something about a Halloween S n' S game before promptly passing out."" Mike explained. Beanie's grin could no longer be held back as it practically split her face in two. she brought out several sheets of paper and slammed them onto the table alongside some pencils.

character sheets.

""all right, we only have about two months before Halloween. so lets use the rest of tonight to make some cheesy characters to mess with Marion! multiple, in case they die during the campaign! I'm thoroughly versed with how the new version of S n' S works, so leave all the details to me!"" she proclaimed excitedly. Bonson put his console down and looked at the sheets with a hint of intrigue, grabbing one and a pencil.

Mike chuckled at the sight ""and a geek is born."" he joked. Rackham laughed at his words, followed by Chichi and soon even Beanie. Bonnibel was busy drawing a character.

Bonson scooted closer to Bonnibel and quirked an eyebrow

""so, where's your parents?"" he asked. Bonnibel turned to him and shot him a deadpan

""im 27 years old.""

1llm9to,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1llm9to/found_something_that_is_working_for_me_protein/,"Found something that is working for me (protein, walking + weekend breaks) and the fat is MELTING off.","Hello, my (42M, 181cm) highest weight was 115kg (253lbs) at the start of 2023. I've always struggled with weight but got to an okay place in my 20s hovering around 95kg, but then I moved to NZ, job was very sedentary and quickly went over 100kg. Becoming a father and working long hours and little sleep just made it so that I overate and I kept getting bigger and didn't really notice.

First I did keto and two rounds of that got me to 102.2 (225lbs) in 6 months. But because I did it very unsustainably, I rebounded hard and went back up to over 110kg by the end of the year.

At that point I thought there was something wrong with my body and I'd reached a new low with how much the weight was bothering me, so I went to my doctor and I went onto Contrave at the beginning of 2024. Just going through my life as usual without any major exercise I went down to just under 100kg which was amazing. And the magic of Contrave wasn't that it made me lose weight (by not overeating) it was that it kind of short circuited my brain and showed me that it was possible to eat normal food, but if it was the right amounts, then it was possible to lose weight through diet alone.

Well after april 2024, I had to come off the contrave for other medical reasons, but I started walking a lot more, discovered protein powder to increase my protein and help with intermittent fasting and managed to pretty much maintain. sometimes I'd go up to 102 but I was able to bring it back down with the increased walking I was doing and eventually down to my lowest which was 96.8 (213.4lbs).

Then xmas 2024, I flew back home to UK for a few weeks, had a break from the diet and exercise and had slowly crept up to 104 (229lbs) in May thi year. This is where the latest lifestyle change has kicked in where I've lost 7kg (15.4lbs) in 5 weeks.

I've started increasing my daily weekday walks to 8k which includes lots of inclines (i live in a very hilly city with great views very near my house). in I have also started doing strength training (some dumbbells just 5kg for now). Diet consists of 1 scoop of protein powder with coffee in the morning, one in afternoon with a very light lunch (2x ryvita crackers or a bit off scrambled egg) and for dinner, its usually steak or chicken breast with broccolli and/or boiled carrots. and that dinner can be quite large too as long as its mostly protein and non high carb veggies. Then some blueberries after if I fancy a little something sweet.

The best bit is that I've also found that on friday evenings, I will treat myself to some takeaway food and have a little bit of dessert. throughout the weekend I will also relax and have a little bit of carbs and sweet treats. As long as I don't go overboard, if I get back to the routine on monday, the water weight goes and I quickly go back down to what I was before and the process starts again. The break I think might be kickstarting my metabolism each week. The fact that I almost know that there is a bump at the end of the week but that it will come off is great because it's only 4.5 days until I can enjoy eating food and relax and not beat myself up over it. And the evening meals during the week actually are quite satisfying (steak!).

I've been daily weighting throughout all this and its great to see it in a spreadsheet with a graph. I'm setting myself two goals of 95kg (209.4lbs) and 90kg (198.4lbs) so hopefully I can keep this 4.5:2.5 thing going. The crazy thing, is that walking is so easy. It's just 1.5 hours of my day, I leave my house, walk, listen to music or podcast then I'm back home and feel great knowing that it's helping :)",9,1751003300.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

1llm9fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1llm9fq/im_a_detective_i_was_called_to_a_domestic_dispute/,I'm a detective. I was called to a  domestic dispute between a husband and a wife. Their son told me they eat people.,"The report lay on my desk. The words were printed there in stark black ink. ‚ÄúDomestic Disturbance. 14 Seabird Lane, Cormorant‚Äôs Perch Island.‚Äù And below, were the names. ‚ÄúElias and Elara Vance.‚Äù

""A domestic on the Perch? That‚Äôs a new one,"" I said, and the springs of my chair groaned under my weight. ""They usually handle their own business.""

Sergeant O‚ÄôMalley worked his crossword and did not look up. He had a face creased with a permanent judgment against the world and all its doings. 

""Noise complaint came from their nearest neighbor, old man Hemlock. Said they were going at it loud enough to scare the gulls off his roof. A lot of smashing, apparently. The Vances haven't been answering the line since."" He raised his head and in his eyes you could see the pale, flat blue of a winter sky over a dead ocean. ""You‚Äôre up, Harper.""

""Me? Don't you think sending a familiar face, like Gibbs, might be better? Those folks are‚Ä¶ particular.""

""Gibbs has got a multi-car pile up on the causeway,"" O‚ÄôMalley said. ""And you need to learn how to deal with the 'particulars' if you ever want to make a career in this coastal jurisdiction. It's just a lovers' quarrel. Go over there, knock some heads, tell them to keep it down, and be back before lunch."" He nodded with his chin toward the pistol on my hip. ""And you know the islanders‚Äô rules about mainland formalities. Leave that here. It spooks them.""

""You want me to go to an island known for its hostility to outsiders to mediate a potentially violent domestic dispute, unarmed?""

""It‚Äôs not hostile, it's private,"" he said. ""And they‚Äôre not savages, Alex. They're fishermen and farmers who want to be left alone. A uniform is authority enough. Now go.""

I rose and unclipped the sidearm from my belt. 

The island was a twenty minute boat ride from mainland. The hundred or so that lived there lived by their own reckonings. They schooled their children in a one room house and sent them out onto the water when they came of age. 

They bartered and they kept to themselves and they only crossed to the mainland for what the island couldn‚Äôt provide. They had their own laws and an old man to speak them and for their trouble to find its way to our desks on the mainland meant the trouble was serious. 

The deck of the ferry was cold beneath my feet. A low gray mist lay upon the water and shrouded all things from sight. It muffled the drone of the engine and swallowed the world until the mainland dissolved into a smear of gray behind us. 

The Perch grew out of the void ahead, a dark up-thrust of rock and pine that clawed at the sky. Then you could see the houses, bleached white things that clung to the stone or clustered near the harbor like seafoam caught in a crevice. 

An old woman sat hunched on a bench in a thick wool shawl. She was the only other soul aboard and she looked at the water and not at me and she did not speak.

When the ferry groaned and nudged the dock timbers I was the only one to stand. I stepped onto the wet wood and the air was another air altogether. The salt of it and the reek of pine and the smoke of wood fires burning somewhere beyond the stony rise. An older quiet was here. No sound of cars, no human call. Just the wind and the gulls. 

Some men in oilskins and heavy sweaters worked on nets by a beached boat. Their hands moved with a slowness that bespoke a world without clocks. They stopped their work to watch me come ashore and their eyes read the blue uniform and then they turned away. No word.

I looked at a faded map that was nailed to a post by the dock. Seabird Lane was at the far end of the village and I set out on that path.

The houses were old things built to stand against the wind and the sea, scrubbed clean against the rot, and nets lay draped on fences like grave shrouds. There were gardens starved by the salt wind but still showing color. 

I saw faces in the dark glass of windows, pale specters that watched my passing and then were gone. And then I saw the house, 14 Seabird Lane. It was a cottage like the others but set apart from them.

In the garden a clay pot lay shattered upon the stone walk and its dark soil was spilled out amongst the ruin of red flowers. Through a window left open to the wind I could hear the sounds. A man‚Äôs low rumble and a woman‚Äôs sharp answer. 

They were still at it. 

I drew a lungful of cold air to ready myself and I knocked my fist against the door. Inside, all sound stopped. A long quiet. Then the door groaned on its hinges and opened into the dark of the house.

The man who stood in the doorframe was a wall of bulk and weathered hide that filled the space of the door. He wore a beard and his hands were the size of quarry stones, stained about the quicks of his nails with a blackness like engine grease or old blood. 

This would be Elias Vance. His eyes held a hard light, but when they fell upon the blue of my uniform some of that light seemed to fail, leaving behind what might‚Äôve been shame or only surprise. 

In the dimness of the house beyond him a woman stood with her arms crossed over her. Her hair was red and it was twisted up in a knot at the back of her head. On the floorboards near her feet lay a broken plate.

""Elias Vance?"" I said. ""I'm Detective Alex Harper, from the mainland precinct. We received a complaint about a disturbance.""

He gave a noise in his throat that was not a word and stepped back from the door. I entered into a smell of brine and stewed herbs and some other scent beneath that was the scent of the house itself, of old wood and old sorrows. 

The space was neat except for the evidence of their war. The broken plate. A stool overturned on its side. And on the stairs that climbed into the darkness of the second floor a boy sat watching us with wide and unnervingly still eyes.

""There's no need for mainland business here,"" Elara Vance said. ""My husband and I were having a private discussion. That gossip Hemlock should learn to mind his own business.""

""A discussion that involves breaking things and shouting loud enough for your neighbors to hear is no longer private, ma'am,"" I said. ""I do not want to put this in a report. I only want to know what happened and see that everyone is okay. Is anyone hurt?""

Elias stared at the floorboards and his jaw was tight. It was the woman who spoke. ""He gets these fits of temper. It's how he is. He believes I am careless.""

""Careless with what?"" I asked. 

""With our traditions,"" Elias said, his voice was a low rumble from the pit of his chest. ""She forgets the importance of things. She becomes‚Ä¶ lenient."" 

His eyes were on her then, a look that was not simple anger but a deeper and more searing judgment, as if she had broken some covenant between them.

""The traditions haven't kept our stores full for the winter, have they?"" she said. ""Sometimes you have to adapt. Be practical.""

""Alright alright,"" I said, holding up my hands as if to ward off a blow. ""Look, I can tell you're both passionate people. I'm not here to take sides or to pry into your island ways. I‚Äôm only here to make sure disagreements don't become dangerous. Has there been any physical violence? Elias, did you lay a hand on your wife?""

""Never,"" he said. He looked at me as if the question itself were the offense. ""I would never harm Elara.""

""And you, Elara?"" I asked, turning to her. ""Did you feel threatened?""

She drew a breath, and her gaze moved from my face to her husband‚Äôs and back again as if weighing two different kinds of trouble. ""He is loud,"" she said. ""But other than that, no, Detective. He did not hurt me.""

""Then I am calling it a quarrel that went past its bounds,"" I said. ""But I will have to file a minor report. You should know that if we are called back to this house for this reason, the law will take a harder hand. Do you understand?""

They both gave a short, silent nod. 

The fury had not left the room but it had drawn back into the corners. A strange and weary quiet took its place. Elias went to the spot on the floor and he knelt and with his great hands began to gather the larger shards of the plate. 

The woman watched him for a long moment, and a look passed over her face that I could not read, and then she turned and went into the kitchen and I heard the scrape of a kettle being set upon the stove.

I was scratching a note in my book when I felt the weight of his stare. The boy on the stairs had not moved. He sat pale in the gloom and lost inside his clothes. His eyes were like holes burned in a blanket. The argument had taken root in him in a way it had not in his parents. 

The peace had been made, such as it was. I could take the afternoon ferry back across the water and set the strange accounting of it down on paper. I snapped the book shut and I slipped the weight of it into my coat. 

The woman Elara returned from the darkness of the kitchen. She would not meet my eye but looked instead toward her husband as he stood like a beast of burden by the door. 

""Elias, fetch some driftwood for the evening fire,"" she said, and her voice was not a wife's request but a command given to dismiss him from her sight. So she might offer up some parting lie of peace before sending me from her house.

Elias looked at me a final time, and the storm was still in his face, but he gave a curt nod of his head and turned and was gone out the back door into the gray light. When he was gone it was as if some great weight had been lifted from the low timbers of that house.

""Thank you for your visit, Detective Harper,"" Elara said, and her voice was softer now. ""I am sorry for the trouble.""

""It's no trouble at all, ma'am. I just want to ensure things remain peaceful here,"" I said, and I moved toward the door. ""Domestic disputes can be unsettling for everyone. Especially children."" I turned my head to where the boy still sat on the stairs. ""Is he doing alright?""

""Finn is a sensitive boy,"" she said, and she made a gesture with her hand as if shooing a fly, as if his nature were a defect she had learned to abide. ""He has an active imagination.""

As I stood on the threshold I felt a sudden and urgent claim on the hem of my coat. I turned and the boy was there. He stood behind me with a strange look on his face. He looked past me into the house to where his mother worked by the hearth, and he made sure she was not looking.

""I need to tell you something,"" he whispered.

I crouched down and looked into his face. 

""What is it Finn? You can tell me.""

He leaned to me and his hand was a small cold fist clenching the cloth of my jacket. 

His eyes were wild with a terror that had no place in the heart of a child.

""They're not fighting about what you think,"" he whispered. ""It‚Äôs about people from the mainland. It's always about them.""

""What about them Finn?""

He swallowed, and his gaze flew to the gray and twisted trees. Then he leaned so close his lips were nearly at my ear.

""My mum and dad,"" he said. ""They eat them. They eat people from the mainland.""

The words landed in the plain air and they meant nothing. The notion of it. Cannibalism? On an island a stone‚Äôs throw from a modern American town? It was preposterous. It had to be a child‚Äôs interpretation of something ugly he‚Äôd heard. 

I set the words aside as you would a piece of stone that did not fit the wall you were building. I reached out and with a gentle pull I loosened his hand from my coat. I gave him a smile.

""Hey, it‚Äôs alright,"" I said. ""Grown ups say some pretty scary sounding things when they‚Äôre angry, don't they? Sometimes it sounds like they could 'eat each other alive.' It's just an expression. It doesn't mean it's real. Your parents love you, and they don‚Äôt eat anyone. I promise.""

But the boy was not comforted. He looked at me and his face collapsed into a mask of pure and desolating grief. It was the look of a true believer who has been met with apostasy. The tears stood in his eyes but did not fall. 

""No,"" he whispered. ""You don't understand. You *don't* understand."" He turned from me then and fled, his small feet in their socks making no sound on the wood of the floor, and he was gone up the stairs into the shadows of the house.

I stood and turned my back. I had done my work here. It was time to leave this quiet desolation and return to the mainland where things could be measured and made sense of. 

I began to walk. But the boy's whisper went with me. It was a stubborn and unwelcome shadow that the sun could not burn away.

The boy‚Äôs words had planted a seed of disquiet in my mind and while I told myself that this was a child's fiction born from a house of unhappy truth, reason would not set my heart at ease.

 I told myself that the human mind will invent monsters to explain the sorrows of the world, for the monsters can be slain.

I was halfway to the ferry landing where the gray water lapped at the timbers of the dock when a voice called out to me, a voice rich and warm. ""Detective! A moment, if you would be so kind.""

I turned and saw an old man seated upon a bench that had been hewn from a single great log of driftwood. He had a beard that flowed down his chest, white as seafoam, and his eyes were a startling and brilliant blue. 

In his hands he held a piece of wood and a small knife and from the wood he was coaxing the shape of a bird. His smile was not like the other faces I had seen here. It was a true and genuine thing that creased the old map of his face and it was a thing that could disarm a man before he knew he had been armed. He radiated a calm and settled authority. This was the island's elder.

""Good day, sir,"" I said, and I walked to where he sat. ""Detective Alex Harper. You must be Malachi.""

""Indeed I am,"" he replied, his voice was a deep and comforting burr. ""And I would guess, from the grim set of your shoulders as you arrived and the slightly less troubled look upon you now, that you have successfully poured oil on the troubled waters at the Vance household.""

""Something like that,"" I said. ""It seems to have been settled for the time being. Hopefully they‚Äôll keep it down from now on.""

""Elias has a hard head and Elara a sharp tongue,"" Malachi said, and he chuckled low in his chest as his knife continued its deft and practiced work. ""It is an unfortunate pairing of temperaments at times. But their hearts are true to our ways. We are grateful you made the trip, Detective. It relieves me of having to deliver a harsher island judgment."" He stopped his work then and looked up at me, and his gaze was both kind and possessed of a deep and knowing power. ""But you look weary from your journey. You are already headed back to the mainland then? What a pity.""

""Well, my work here is done, and‚Ä¶"" I let the words fall away, for I would not tell this man that his island had creeped me out.

""But your visit is so short!"" Malachi exclaimed, and a look of true disappointment crossed his face. ""You mainlanders are always in such a rush. You never stop to truly see our little world. It truly is a shame, because you arrive on our shores at a most auspicious time. Our annual Harvest Festival is in just two days.""

He said the words Harvest Festival as if they were a benediction, and his eyes took on a light of deep and holy reverence. ""It is the highlight of our year,"" he said. ""A celebration of the sea's bounty, the season‚Äôs turn. There is music, dancing, a great feast. It is a spectacle I assure you cannot be found anywhere on your side of the water. A real piece of living history.""

A curiosity rose in me against my better judgment. It was a lure and I was a fish rising to it. ""A festival, you say? I suppose I could stay. I do have a couple of personal days I could take.""

A beatific smile bloomed upon Malachi‚Äôs face. ""Excellent! I would consider it a personal honor, and a wonderful gesture of goodwill between the Perch and the mainland authorities. It shows us you care beyond the matters of law enforcement. Please, stay as our guest."" He pointed with the tip of his knife down a path that led away from the dock. ""Old Martha runs a small guesthouse just off the cove. The 'Mariner's Rest.' She will make you feel right at home. I will inform her to expect you.""

The offer was warm and heartfelt, it smothered the last of the boy‚Äôs dark whisper. The Elder himself was inviting me. This was the path of reason. This was an offer of peace, an unplanned holiday on an island of strange and simple folk.

""Alright, Malachi,"" I said, and I heard myself laugh. ""You've convinced me. Thank you.""

""The pleasure is all mine, my boy,"" he said, and his gaze returned to the wood in his hands, which I could now see was a perfect, tiny seagull, wings poised for flight. ""You will enjoy yourself. Everyone is so very welcoming to our special guests.""

An hour later I stood in a room at the Mariner‚Äôs Rest. Martha was a woman with kind eyes and hands soft with dough and she showed me to a room with a bed dressed in a quilt of many colors and a window that looked out upon the sea. 

I used the guesthouse telephone and called the precinct and told O'Malley I was taking my days. He grumbled at the wire's other end and spoke a word about me going native and then he approved it.

I unpacked the few poor things I carried in my bag and I looked out from my window upon the island of Cormorant's Perch. The mist was breaking and thin shafts of a pale sun descended through the pines. 

Malachi was right. I had judged this place with a mainlander's prejudice. I had allowed the ravings of a troubled child to color the world with a darkness that was not there. 

The islanders were not monsters. They were people wedded to their rock and to their old and peculiar ways, and I had been given the chance to witness it. I had set my foot upon a new path and chose to believe it was a path of my own choosing.

I woke to the cries of gulls. At the insistence of Malachi I was not charged for my lodging or my meals. Old Martha set out before me a breakfast of smoked fish, bread and coffee. 

She moved about the kitchen with a solemn sort of care, her attentions not so much of kindness but as of some duty she was called to perform.

""The Harvest is a joyous time, Detective,"" she said, and her hand was steady as she refilled my cup. ""A time for us to give thanks for the blessings the sea provides us. It is wonderful to have a mainlander here to share in it with us. It's been so long since we've had a guest for the festival.""

After the meal I set out to walk the island. The paths were little more than lines scratched into the hide of the land, and they wound through a close press of pine and rock that was the island‚Äôs heart. 

For hours I saw no people, and heard nothing but the wind in the high branches and the sound of my own passage. I came at last to the cliffs at the southern edge of the land, a sheer escarpment where the land gave up its claim to the world. 

Far below the waves hammered at the rocks, a constant and violent toil. It was a place of a terrible beauty, and the water churned like a great gray millrace of the abyss.

Toward midday I turned back, and a smell drew me to the village, the smell of roasting meat and the far-off sound of some music. The place had come alive with a purpose. They were stringing ribbons of garish color from house to house, and in the center of the square a great pyre of wood was being raised. Trestle tables of raw timber were set out beside it, long as the feasting tables of old kings.

""A good day for a stroll, Detective,"" a man's voice called. He sat on an overturned lobster pot mending a net of deep blue color. I knew him from the docks.

""It certainly is,"" I replied, and walked toward him. ""Alex Harper.""

""Orrin,"" he said. He offered me his hand and the grip of it was hard. ""Pleased to have you with us for the Harvest. It's only right we show our mainland neighbors our truest selves once in a while.""

We sat and spoke for the better part of an hour while he worked. He told me stories of storms that had names like gods, and of the old feuds between the fishing families, and of strange fish that they pulled from the deep channels, things with no names on the mainland charts. 

His talk was filled with the island‚Äôs traditions, of the hunger of the sea and of the price of its bounty, and I listened as a man listens to the parables of a faith he does not share but finds compelling.

Later I saw a woman named Brenna. She sat weaving a great tapestry, and upon it were the figures of islanders in a boat heaving a great net from a black sea. In the net were other figures, things that had once been men, their limbs set at angles of profound distress. 

""It tells the story of the First Harvest,"" she explained, and her fingers never ceased their nimble and practiced dance. ""How our ancestors learned to receive the gifts from the deep, gifts that keep our people strong and hale through the cold winters."" She looked up and gave me a serene and beatific smile. ""Every festival, we welcome a traveler to share in the tradition, a custom passed down from the beginning, to honor the bond between the settled and the adrift.""

I looked at the grim tableau she was weaving and took it for their sacred history and a strange thing to celebrate with such an open heart.

That evening I ate with Martha and two old sailors whose flesh was too frail for the sea but whose eyes still held the look of it. Martha served a thick dark stew of roots I could not name and a meat she called only island game and would say no more of it. 

We drank a wine made from berries that grew on the rock, a thing of some potency, and it coursed in the blood like a warm and drowsy poison that smoothed the hard edges of the world. 

The warmth of these people, the welcome they offered up, it was a constant and disarming tide that pulled at the pilings of my own reason.

As I climbed the stair to my room the world seemed a simple place and all the sorrows of the mainland were a distant country. I lay in the dark and from the village came the slow and solemn beat of a drum, a sound like the beating of a great heart. 

It was the sound of a thing coming to pass, of a rite being prepared. I chose to hear in that sound a song of peace, and let the darkness take me.

The morning broke gray and doleful, and the day of the Harvest Festival arrived under a sky of leaden slate pulled low across the water. 

The wine of the night before had left a bitter sediment in my blood and I sought to clear my head with a walk along the shore before the ordained celebrations of the evening began. 

I chose a different path this time, a track that led toward a cove of which Orrin had spoken, a place of rocks and tide pools that the islanders called the Boneyard.

""It‚Äôs where the sea gives back what it has taken,"" he had said, and there was a knowing in his eye I had mistaken for charm. ""Whale bones, smoothed glass, shipwrecked timbers.""

The path was no path but a scar through the gorse that descended toward a crescent of black shingle where the sea foamed and fretted. The cove was a sepulcher of driftwood, a tangled ossuary of trees scoured and bleached to a bone whiteness by the salt and sun. 

I saw where the great rib of a leviathan broke from the sand like the arch of a ruined cathedral. I walked the tideline where the last wave had laid its lace of foam upon the shore. 

I was soothed by the solemn and rhythmic hammer of the waves, by the cold and absolute solitude of that place. I bent to the shingle to retrieve a stone worn smooth as a palmful of worry when I saw it.

It was a shard of unnatural whiteness protruding from the wet and sucking sand.

I knelt in the dampness and worked it free with my fingers from the cold earth. It was not a piece of shell nor of coral. It was the distal phalanx of a human finger. There was no mistaking its morbid and articulate perfection. 

A coldness that had no source in the sea air entered into me, a chill from some other and more terrible climate. 

I stood and made to hurl it back into the water, to give it to the sea‚Äôs forgetting, when I saw the glint of metal upon it. Corroded and green from its long slumber in the salt, a circle of baser metal, a cheap and simple wedding band, still clung to the bone.

My eyes quartered the beach with a new and terrible attention. They were no longer the eyes of a tourist but of a hunter, or of the hunted. And in that desolate place there was a new testament written in the debris, and I began to read.

Half-hidden in a great clot of rotting net cast high against the cliff was the shattered arch of a human mandible. It was yellowed with age, and a few teeth still clung to their sockets. Save for one, which held the dull gleam of an amalgam filling, a small testament of dentistry and a life lived on the other side of the water.

I took a step back from it, and my feet turned on the slick stones. The boy‚Äôs whisper returned to me, no longer a child‚Äôs fever dream but a truth spoken from the heart. *They eat people from the mainland.*

My gaze fell upon the driftwood piles with a dawning horror, and that which I had taken for the ribs of seals or porpoises I now saw with a new and awful clarity to be the staved-in architecture of a human cage. I saw a splintered femur that had been gnawed and broken. 

These were not skeletons. 

These were the leavings. 

This was the offal of a feast.

The friendly welcome of the Elder Malachi. The hearty parables of Orrin. The strange tapestry of Brenna the weaver with its figures pulled misshapen from the deep. The meat in Martha‚Äôs stew, a thing with no name but with a provenance I now understood.

All of it came together in my mind, a constellation of terror whose shape was now revealed. 

This was not a harvest of the sea. 

It was a harvest of men.

I turned from that place of bones and I ran. I clawed my way up the slick embankment, my hands gripping at the thorns of the gorse and at the wet and naked roots of trees as if they were the hands of saviors held out to me from the living world. 

I burst from the ravine‚Äôs edge and did not stop. I ran with the terror of a debased animal back to the false sanctuary of the Mariner‚Äôs Rest and a single thing was screaming in the meat of my brain. I must get off this island. 

I crashed through the guesthouse door and fled up the stairs. I slammed the door to my room and leaned my back against the wood.

My eyes scanned the small confines of my room. One door. One window that gave out onto the square. My training was not made for this. This was a heresy of the flesh, a pagan rite as old as the rocks it was enacted upon.

My radio. With hands that would not be still I retrieved it from my bag. I raised its small antenna and thumbed the switch and pressed it to my ear. There was no squawk of the dispatcher‚Äôs call. 

There was nothing. 

I turned the small black box over in my hands. And I saw it. At the base of the antenna the wire was severed. A clean and precise cut. Some careful artisan of my doom had been in my room. While Orrin filled my ears with his parables of the sea? While Martha set out her stews? While I had walked in my ignorance among the tombs of their making? 

I walked to the window and through a crack in the lace I looked down upon the square. The spectacle of the festival was nearly prepared. The pyre stood mountainous in the dusk. 

The islanders moved about their work with the grim and purposeful industry of acolytes at their devotions. The smiles I had taken for welcome I now saw as the ravenous and serene masks of predators. 

I saw Malachi directing the final preparations, a high priest in his element. As if he felt the weight of my gaze he looked up from his duties, and his eyes scanned the windows of the guesthouse. 

Our gazes met and held for a long second across that ordained space. He gave me a slow and placid nod. It was a benediction. It was a final and awful amen. For I was not the guest. I was the honored guest. I was the harvest.

I remained in that room while the last of the light bled out of the sky. My mind scrabbled at ways to escape. Swim to the mainland? I‚Äôd freeze to death. Steal one of their boats? The islanders‚Äô boats would be guarded as such upon this holy night. 

There was nothing but the clothing on my back. 

My only path forward was to play along.

I poured cold and dead water from the pitcher into the basin and put my face in it. In the clouded and weeping glass of the mirror I saw a ghost looking back. A pale face whose eyes held a terror I knew I must conceal behind some semblance of civility. 

I coached the pale man in the glass. ‚ÄúYou are just a visitor. You are eager for the festival.‚Äù

I descended the stair. Old Martha stood in the gloom of the lobby, polishing glasses. When she saw me she offered up a smile of such grotesque welcome that it was a thing of surpassing horror.

""Ah, Detective Harper! There you are!"" she said. ""I was beginning to worry you would sleep through the commencement feast! You must be hungry. Go on, join the others in the square. The fire will be lit soon. Find Malachi, he has saved you a seat of honor.""

I contrived a smile. ""Wouldn't miss it for the world, Martha.‚Äù

Outside the world had been remade by fire. Torches on high staves bled a guttering light onto the scene. The air was heavy with the sacramental odor of pine smoke and the rendering of fat from a massive pit near the fire. 

The islanders were gathered at long tables of rough hewn timber, drinking from wooden cups and laughing a laugh that was not a sound of mirth but of a ravenous and primal joy. A knot of men made music on fiddles and drums.

I moved through them.

Orrin clapped a hand on my shoulder. ""Almost time, Detective! You'll never see another night like this one!"" 

Brenna the weaver smiled at me from the depths of some beatific trance. All of it was an act, and I the guest, for whom this final act was prepared for.

I saw Malachi then. He stood like some ghastly pontiff at the head of the main table, a crown of dark ivy on his white hair. He motioned me toward him and I made my legs obey.

""Alexander, my boy!"" he boomed, gesturing to the seat beside him. ""I am so delighted you have joined us. I trust your day was‚Ä¶ illuminating?""

""Very scenic, yes,"" I managed.

""Excellent,"" he said. He turned and raised his cup and a sudden and profound silence fell upon that place. ""People of the Perch! We gather tonight for the sacred Harvest, as our forebears did, and their forebears before them! We thank the unending sea for the bounty it brings to our shores!""

A great and terrible baying rose from the assembly. 

""And we thank the drifting souls who find their way here,"" he continued, and his cold eyes found mine and held them. ""Who nourish our traditions and give of themselves so that our community may survive another year!""

The crowd roared, their faces a gallery of feverish and contorted masks in the firelight. They raised their cups to me. All of them. And Malachi turned to me and in the din his voice was a whisper of venom and benediction for me alone.

""It is a great honor you provide us, Detective Harper. The greatest honor we can bestow. You are now truly a part of our island story. Forever.""

Platters of rendered meat and steaming roots were passed down the long boards of the tables. One was set before me, a charnel bounty piled high upon the plate, and I could not look at it.

""First, you will eat with us,"" Malachi said, and his voice was of a silken and dreadful honey but with a subtext of iron. ""It is tradition that the guest partakes.""

They were going to wait until I was full and slow. I picked at the flesh with my fork and the ghastly ruse was the only thing between my life and the pyre that awaited it.

""Tell me, Malachi,"" I said, and I marveled at the steadiness of my own voice as it came forth from my throat. ""The ceremony itself. When does that happen? What am I to expect?""

His smile widened. ""Patience, my boy. After the feast comes the music, then the dance. A spiral dance, winding to the very center of the square. That is where we show our ultimate gratitude. At the foot of the fire, under the moon.""

My eyes quartered the square. The fire and the torches were the world‚Äôs only light, and beyond their bleeding circles lay the utter blackness of the cliffs and the docks. It was the only way out of that lit and holy hell.

Then came the dispensation for which I had not dared to pray. A man burdened with a roasted leg stumbled, and his platter crashed upon the earth with a wet and greasy clap. 

A momentary confusion took hold as men rushed to this small ruin, and their bodies formed a brief and chaotic screen between Malachi and myself.

My mind surrenders its claim and my body acted upon its own terrible ordinance. I shoved the great weight of the table and sent Malachi‚Äôs cup spilling its dark wine across his lap. He sputtered a curse. I was over the bench and into the shadows before the first cry went up.

""The guest is leaving!"" a woman shrieked. ""Don't let him reach the docks!""

The frantic music of the feast was strangled in an instant, and in its place there rose a bestial clamor and the percussion of heavy boots upon the hardpan. I ran as I had not run since I was a boy who feared ghosts in the dark, and now the ghosts were real and at my back. 

I ran through the warren of lanes and between the salt-eaten cottages and their knowledge of the place was offset by the pure and animal fury of my flight. I hid myself behind a stack of cordwood and held my breath as two fishermen passed, their faces limned with a righteous anger, and then I ran again toward the sound and the smell of the sea.

The docks. I broke from the last line of the houses and saw the harbor. A few boats sat tied fast in the black water, their familiar forms of no use to me. And then I saw it. Churning slow from the far pier was a light, and I heard the slow and steady systole and diastole of a diesel engine. It was a mainlander‚Äôs boat, a trawler hugging the dark shore.

It was my only hope. 

""There he is!"" A roar from the blackness behind me. 

A clot of men bearing torches broke from the village, and at their head was Orrin, his face raw, filled with the intent of murderous sacrament.

They would be on me before I could reach the pier. I did the only thing that was left to a man in my extremity. I scrambled down the rockface at the harbor‚Äôs edge, my hands shredded on the shells and the stone. 

I fell into the water and the shock of such lethal cold seized the very heart in my chest. And I swam. I put my head down and crawled through the black and frigid water, my strength a coin I spent with every stroke, my arms reaching for that single receding light.

The shouts at my back turned to curses, and then to silence. They did not follow. They were content to commend my soul to the sea‚Äôs cold ministry. The sea did its work. My limbs were things of lead and my lungs were filled with fire. 

And as the last of my strength left me, as I prepared to give myself to the deep, my flailing hand struck something hard and unyielding. 

The hull.

A rope ladder hung down its side. With my fingers I hooked them through the rungs and I pulled myself from the water and came to be on the scaly and reeking deck of the boat. 

I collapsed and drew air into my lungs in great ragged gasps as the lights of Cormorant's Perch, the lights of that ordained and hellish feast, dwindled to a fading constellation of malevolent light upon the black and endless waters. 

And I was alive.

The fisherman who pulled me from the black water looked upon me as if I were a shade dredged up from the seafloor, a thing not meant to return to the world of men. 

He gave me a blanket that reeked of fish and salt and the great and abiding rot of the ocean and pointed the nose of his trawler toward the mainland‚Äôs distant lights. 

I offered a broken telling of a boating accident and he did not question it, for the animal terror in my eyes was a testament older than any words.

In the clean and well lit rooms of the station house my story sounded like madness. They listened with the concern of men who hear a confession for a sin they cannot comprehend. 

I gave them my testimony. Finn‚Äôs whisper. The charnel ground of the cove. The sabotaged radio. My flight from that ordained feast. 

They sent a Coast Guard chopper to circle that rock. The report came back and said everything was normal. A fishing village. Quiet  people. There was no proof, for this evil was a thing that left no proof, only a profound and terrible absence.

Sergeant O‚ÄôMalley was a bull of a man whose faith was in the solidity of the world, and my story was a heresy against his church. 

""Hypothermia, exhaustion,"" he declared, his voice a sermon for the bullpen. ""Couple that with some of their home brewed poison and you hallucinated the whole damned thing, Harper. Get a grip."" 

For a week I sat in that purgatory of paperwork and every time I closed my eyes the world dissolved into the gray shingle of the cove and the pale and horrid glimmer of bone in the sand. 

Every shadow wore the face of Malachi, his smile a placid benediction upon my damnation. I was a man who had seen God's monstrous other half and they called me mad for it.

Then on a morning like any other the telephone on the main desk rang. I saw O‚ÄôMalley emerge from his office reading a slip of paper, and his face was a study in irritation. 

""Unbelievable,"" he said, and he stopped at my desk. ""Get this. Another domestic complaint from your precious island getaway.""

""Sir?"" I asked, and I rose from my chair though my legs were made of straw.

""Noise complaint. Boyfriend and a girlfriend this time, apparently. Some young couple named Thorne. Just moved over from the mainland six months ago looks like. Neighbor is reporting yelling, screaming. The whole nine yards. Standard procedure,"" he said, turning toward a rookie named Peterson, a boy so young his piety for the badge was still upon him. ""Peterson! You're up.""

The air went out of me. ""Sergeant, no,"" I said. ""No, sir, you can't.""

He turned back and his brows were a furrowed and angry line. 

""Can't what, Harper? Can't do my job? Can't send an officer to a simple public disturbance call?""

""You don't understand, sir. It's a lure. It's not a real dispute,"" I said, stepping toward him. 

""It's how they do it. It's how they get someone out there. First my call, now this one‚Ä¶ don't you see the pattern? You can't send him.""

""Detective, that is enough,"" he said. ""You have your own conspiracy theories, that's fine. Deal with them on your own time. But you will not interfere with police business based on some fever dream you had. Peterson is a capable officer. He doesn't carry your‚Ä¶ baggage."" He gave me a last look of dismissal. ""Now get back to your desk.""

He turned his back on me. The sentence was passed. I returned to my place and I watched as Peterson, young and doomed and eager to prove his worth, grabbed the keys to his patrol car. ""And Peterson,"" O‚ÄôMalley called out to him. ""It‚Äôs the Perch. No sidearm. Just keep the peace.""

The boy gave a nod full of a terrible and unknowing confidence. He cast a look of pity upon me as he passed, the sane man pitying the seer, and then he walked out into the light of the day.

That was three days ago. Peterson never activated his radio. The rock has gone mute out there in the gray expanse of the water. He has not come back. 

And I know with a dreadful and certain gnosis that he never will. 

The great and terrible wheel has turned, the old blood sacrifice is paid, and the harvest is come again. 

And I who had seen the awful workings of the oracle was now just another soul damned to watch it happen.

*June 24, 2025*

I‚Äôm currently dealing with a work situation that I (28M) need advice on

Before work I go to the gym about every other day. I‚Äôm hardly shredded but I‚Äôve gone enough that you can see my muscles when I come into work in short sleeves. I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as a gym bro or a gym rat, I really just go for my overall health. Anyways, I work in an office with maybe 25-30 people that work there. We mainly do business to business sales and supply (not really relevant to the story).

Anyway, I get to work one day wearing a polo and a couple of girls and guys in the office were asking me if I had been working out recently and I told them that I had. It wasn‚Äôt flirtatious or anything like that I think they were just giving me a friendly compliment, plus I‚Äôm married but as we‚Äôre discussing me working out, my coworker Gary (40sM) walks in. Gary is‚Ä¶ a lot. He's one of those guys who constantly talks about how much he benches, his ""gains,"" and generally just tries to project this super intense, alpha male image. Which is annoying but none of my business really.

This is where the problem starts. Someone asked me what my max bench was. I told them honestly, and Gary, who was lurking nearby, scoffed. Loudly. He then proceeded to tell me, in front of like five other coworkers, that my number (170) was ""pathetic"" and that I clearly wasn't a ""real man"" or an ""alpha."" He then went on a tirade about how men need to be strong and dominate, etc., etc. It was super uncomfortable.I tried to just laugh it off and change the subject, but it didn't work. Since then, it's gotten worse. Every single day, Gary makes some kind of comment. If I'm getting coffee, he'll ask if I'm ""strong enough to lift the pot."" If I'm walking to my desk, he'll flex and ask if I'm ""inspired yet to hit the weights like a real man.‚Äù

I've tried ignoring him, giving him short answers, even politely telling him to knock it off. Nothing works. He just laughs and says I need to ""grow a thicker skin.""

Then, this is where I start to lose my shit a little. My wife (27F) texted me a screenshot yesterday. It was a DM from GARY. It was a picture of him flexing in the mirror with some ridiculous caption about being a ""true alpha"" and how ""real women"" know what's up. (Summarizing but you get the sentiment). He'd somehow found her on social media and sent her this unsolicited picture and message. I was beyond furious. I wanted to march over to his desk and punch him, but I knew that would only make things worse.

I'm starting to dread coming to work. It's constant, it's demeaning, it's making me feel genuinely small and uncomfortable, and now he's involving my wife. Am I overreacting to this? Is this just typical ""guy banter"" that I'm not getting? Should I just suck it up and ignore him, or is this actually something worth addressing with HR? I feel like if I tell HR it might just add fuel to the fire. But if I come down to his level and respond violently, I‚Äôll lose my job.

Update: I‚Äôm going to take this to HR tomorrow, thank you guys for letting me know the severity of this.

Not overreacting.

People tell OOP to go to HR and complain about Gary.

- 

Do you think HR can do anything? I‚Äôm just worried they won‚Äôt do anything and it‚Äôll only make it worse. I‚Äôve never really gone to HR before. Do you know how to approach it?

- 

I think I‚Äôve just let his whole thing about calling me weak get to my head. I‚Äôm just not into violence and I feel like that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to provoke

- 

I feel like maybe he had a crush on one of my female coworkers that was complimenting me and now is trying to embarrass me to impress them or something. That might not be a bad idea but I think some people have convinced me to go to HR now

*June 26, 2025, 2 days later*

Just wanted to update everybody after my last post. I ended up going to HR. I honestly didn‚Äôt think HR would do much because Gary is a good employee in terms of performance but surprisingly they took my complaint very seriously and were in disbelief when I showed them the screen shot of the DM he sent to my wife.

The next day, Gary was not at the office so I wasn‚Äôt sure if they had fired him or if he was just on a suspension at first but our boss told us to let his clients know that he was out for the day if they call the office. So I assumed that meant he got suspended.

He was back this morning. Usually he greets me with some kind of smart remark but today he was really quiet and seemed to be avoiding eye contact with me. When I went to grab some coffee out of the break room a little after that he came in there and asked if we could talk for a second. He proceeded to tell me that HR laid into him big time and they told him that if he pulled anything like that again, it would result in termination. He then proceeded to apologize to me for everything and said that as pathetic as it sounds he was just upset that nobody ever compliments him on going to the gym despite how much time he spends in the gym in his free time. He said it hurt that people acknowledged me when going to the gym wasn‚Äôt as big of a deal for me as it was for him. He then asked for my forgiveness. I honestly felt kind of bad for him in that moment, it was really kinda pathetic but he did seem sorry so I told him I accepted his apology but if he ever messages my wife on anything again, he‚Äôll have a lot more to worry about than an HR complaint. He again apologized.

I don‚Äôt know if this situation is fully resolved given it‚Äôs only been a half day but Gary has been quiet and not at all like himself. We‚Äôll see if this lasts but his apology felt genuine so hopefully this is the last update I‚Äôll have to give on this situation. Thank you to everybody that encouraged me to go to HR. There was a lot of people that pointed out that Gary must be dealing with a lot of insecurities and I think they were right.

There‚Äôs a few things I want to address that were questions in my last post:

How did Gary have my wife‚Äôs info? He found her instagram, a lot of people thought he somehow got her number which wasn‚Äôt the case.

Is this a made up story? No, if you look at my comment history you will see a screenshot of the Instagram DM‚Äôs commented on my last post. It‚Äôs so cartoonish that it sounds like fiction but believe me, this is what people who buy into the red pill bull shit are like, you‚Äôll probably encounter your own Gary at some point if you haven‚Äôt already

Do I really only bench 170? When I said I benched 170, I meant that bench four sets of 12 at 170. I‚Äôve never done a single rep max.

Does Gary have a wife? No, from my understanding, Gary is divorced and has been single for a while.

____

># Some of the comments by OOP:

- 

She didn‚Äôt respond to the dm, just sent the screen shot to me. She thinks Gary is a weirdo and doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be getting any woman anytime soon, let alone somebody else‚Äôs wife

- 

*[why he benches 170 and not 175]*
Because when I go up in weight i increase it by putting 5Lbs plates on each side, that‚Äôs how I end up with awkward numbers sometimes

- 

I don‚Äôt think I can ever be friends after he hit up my wife but I can definitely be civil at work. I think people like them might really be dealing with loneliness and are scared people might reject them so they put up a wall

I'll also need sound effects for example when you click or hover over a button, when the car collides and it's game over, etc. etc. The goal is to make the sound feel light, intentional and subtle, enhancing the overall vibe without drawing too much attention to itself.

It's also perfectly fine if you don't want to work for all of the things I mentioned and just want a part of it (e.g. music for only Honey Theme), you will be paid accordingly but still on a RevShare basis.

I didn‚Äôt see you there! Well, to be fair, you're behind a screen reading this right now, possibly thousands of miles (or kilometers) away from me. How would I have seen you? Okay, now that I got that stupid and cringy introduction out of the way, I can get to the heart of things.

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old guy from the USA who dropped out from medical school last year, after I found out that a career in medicine just isn‚Äôt for me. I currently work at an aerospace company. I live in Washington State, close to the Canadian border, only about 90 minutes from Vancouver, BC. Since I know people care about looks (myself included), [here‚Äôs a picture of me with bad bedhead after just waking up](https://imgur.com/a/LJ8ewZV). I figured that if you still like how I look when I have messy hair and am tired from just waking up, you‚Äôll probably also like how I look most of the time‚ÄîI promise I look better most of the time!

I‚Äôll try my best to give a brief synopsis about myself. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù (188 cm). Actually, I‚Äôm technically 6‚Äô1-‚Öû‚Äù. If you‚Äôre going to bust my chops over ‚Öõ‚Äù (0.32 cm), be my guest. Personality-wise, I‚Äôm definitely more on the introverted side. I‚Äôd describe myself as a fairly typical dorky White guy. Like most guys my age, I like to play video games; I‚Äôve been playing on the recently released Nintendo Switch 2. I love silly things; if you think [this video](https://youtu.be/FKdn4tV4kzc) is funny, I think we‚Äôd get along. I also have a deep fascination with psychology, especially abnormal psychology and evolutionary psychology. I actually majored in psychology back in college (university), and when I was a medical student, I was interested in pursuing psychiatry. Other hobbies of mine include cooking and calligraphy. I‚Äôm totally open to a LDR if we can eventually work to close the gap.

**Here are a few fun facts about me:**

* **I love spicy foods** ‚Äî *I‚Äôve had people from Sichuan (province in China known for its ridiculously spicy cuisine) tell me I have a high spice tolerance*
* **I can speak German decently well** ‚Äî *Zugegeben, mein Deutsch ist ziemlich eingerostet :P*
* **I can touch the tip of my nose with my tongue** ‚Äî *This was a big deal l back when I was like 7 years old, okay?*
* **Despite the fact that I have green eyes, I‚Äôm slightly red-green colorblind** ‚Äî *Histology was the bane of my existence!*
* **I‚Äôm actually pretty good at cooking** ‚Äî *I made some ayam masak merah (Malaysian/Singaporean spicy tomato chicken dish) earlier today. Not to toot my own horn, but it was pretty tasty.*
* **I don‚Äôt like coffee** ‚Äî *I seriously don‚Äôt get all the hype surrounding coffee. People lose their minds over a drink that tastes like fancy, artisanal dirt. There‚Äôs also a plethora of other (oftentimes cheaper) ways to get caffeine, just sayin‚Äô ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø*
* **The smallest country I‚Äôve visited is Liechtenstein** ‚Äî *It‚Äôs À¢·µí À¢·µê·µÉÀ°À°*

  
**This is what I‚Äôm looking for:**

* **Someone who speaks English fluently or near-fluently** ‚Äî *It doesn‚Äôt bother me at all if English isn‚Äôt your native language, as long as you speak it well. I think most non-native accents are cute.*
* **Someone who doesn‚Äôt have kids** ‚Äî *I‚Äôm childfree and want someone who‚Äôs also childfree, though I'm open to having kids in the future, assuming I'm married.*
* **Someone who‚Äôs younger than or the same age as me** ‚Äî *Please respect my preference.*
* **Someone who doesn‚Äôt drink alcohol or do drugs** ‚Äî *I don‚Äôt drink alcohol nor do drugs (including marijuana) and want somebody who doesn‚Äôt either. I suppose I‚Äôd be fine with someone who drinks occasionally/socially, but drugs are a dealbreaker for me.*
* **Someone who has a similar sense of humor** ‚Äî *I‚Äôm pretty sarcastic and the kind of person who likes to tease people I‚Äôm close with. I also like it when people bust my chops (I can take it just as well as I dish it out). I just love good banter! All in good fun, of course.*



Congratulations! You‚Äôve officially slogged through this super long post. If I seem like a decent guy, please feel free to drop me a DM and *tell me your favorite dessert* (mine is a cannoli), so that I know you actually read this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

When looking for a family-friendly living space, the choice of a home is crucial. One option that increasingly catches the eye of families is the 3 bedroom 2 bath barndominium kit. These innovative metal homes blend style, functionality, and comfort, making them a remarkable choice for modern families.

One of the standout benefits of choosing a barndominium kit is the ample space it provides. With three bedrooms, families can enjoy designated areas for parents and children, as well as guest accommodations. Space is often a concern for larger families, and having separate rooms allows everyone to have their privacy while still feeling connected.

The open floor plan characteristic of barndominiums is another significant advantage. Many kits include large living areas, making it easier for families to spend quality time together. An open design fosters communication and togetherness, whether it's during family dinners or game nights. This layout also provides flexibility in how the space is used, enabling families to tailor their home to suit their lifestyle.

Moreover, barndominiums are built using steel, making them incredibly durable. Compared to traditional wooden homes, metal structures stand strong against extreme weather, pests, and fires. This longevity translates to fewer repairs and maintenance costs, a vital consideration for busy families. Having a spacious yet low-maintenance home means more time can be spent enjoying life rather than worrying about renovations.

Another crucial factor is the energy efficiency of these kits. Metal homes can be insulated effectively, helping maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the year. This can lead to lower energy bills and a smaller environmental footprint, which is undeniably beneficial for both the family budget and the planet. An efficiently run home is not only economical but also contributes to a greener world for future generations.

Families with children will appreciate the safety advantages that barndominiums offer. Since they are often built on expansive land, families can enjoy outdoor activities right in their own backyard. Lots of open space encourages kids to play safely outside, away from the congestion of urban living. Plus, the durability of metal homes adds an extra layer of security, providing peace of mind for parents.

Customization is another delightful aspect of 3 bedroom 2 bath barndominium kits. Families can choose designs, layouts, colors, and finishes that suit their tastes and needs. Whether you prefer a modern look or a rustic charm, the options are endless. This makes it easy to create a home that truly reflects your family's personality and values.

Building a barndominium can also save families significant amounts of money. Compared to traditional houses, the construction costs for barndominiums are typically lower. The speed of assembly is an additional plus. Many kits are designed for quick and straightforward construction, allowing families to move into their new homes without excessive delays.

- **Spacious Living:** 3 bedrooms and 2 baths provide ample space for the whole family.
- **Open Floor Plan:** Encourages family interaction and flexible living arrangements.
- **Durability:** Steel structures withstand harsh weather and require less maintenance.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Lowers energy costs and reduces environmental impact.
- **Safety:** Offers secure living with plenty of space for outdoor activities.
- **Customization:** Families can personalize their homes to fit their unique styles.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Generally offers lower construction costs and quicker assembly.

In addition to all these advantages, barndominiums can foster a sense of community. Many developments are located in residential areas where families can interact, share experiences, and build friendships. This can be especially beneficial for families with children, creating a support network that enhances the overall living experience.

Ultimately, choosing a 3 bedroom 2 bath barndominium kit can bring endless rewards for families looking for a comfortable, stylish, and practical home. With their various benefits, these metal homes are paving the way for new generations to create lasting memories together.

Designing a Family-Friendly Layout in Barndominiums: Tips and Ideas
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When designing a family-friendly layout in a barndominium, it's essential to create spaces that cater to the needs of the whole family. Barndominiums, known for their unique blend of rustic charm and modern design, provide a perfect canvas for families to express their style while ensuring comfort and functionality. Here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you create the ideal family-friendly barndominium layout.

### Open Floor Plans for Versatility

One of the standout features of barndominiums is their spacious open floor plans. This design trend promotes interaction among family members while allowing for a multifunctional area. An open layout can help in the following ways:

- **Encourages Togetherness:** A layout where the kitchen, dining, and living areas flow together fosters family bonding.
- **Maximizes Space:** Large areas can accommodate various activities, from watching movies to playing games.
- **Easy Supervision:** Parents can easily keep an eye on younger kids while cooking or working.

### Functional Zones to Enhance Daily Life

It's crucial to design specific zones that can serve various family activities. This ensures that everyone's needs are met without cluttering the living space. Consider including:

- **Activity Area:** Dedicate a section for arts and crafts or homework. Having a designated space can help keep messes contained.
- **Reading Nook:** Create a cozy corner with comfortable seating and shelves filled with books to encourage reading.
- **Play Zone:** Allocate a safe area for children to play independently while parents can relax nearby.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Families often require ample storage to keep their spaces organized. Barndominiums provide numerous opportunities to integrate storage without sacrificing style. Here are some storage ideas:

- **Built-in Cabinets:** Consider built-in cabinetry in the living room and kitchen for stylish and efficient storage.
- **Multi-purpose Furniture:** Use furniture that can double as storage, like ottomans with space inside or coffee tables with drawers.
- **Vertical Space:** Utilize wall shelves to keep items off the floor, giving you more space to walk around comfortably.

### Kid-Friendly Features

Adding kid-friendly features in your barndominium layout can create a safe and enjoyable environment. Here are some must-haves:

- **Rounded Edges:** Opt for furniture with rounded edges to minimize the risk of injury.
- **Non-slip Flooring:** Choose flooring that is safe for kids to run on, reducing the chance of slips and falls.
- **Accessible Storage:** Design lower shelves and storage bins that children can reach, allowing them to help organize their toys and belongings.

### Outdoor Integration

Connecting indoor and outdoor spaces can significantly enhance family life in a barndominium. Consider these ideas for seamless transitions:

- **Outdoor Living Space:** Design a deck or patio where family members can enjoy meals and relaxation outdoors.
- **Play Areas:** Create a safe and fun outdoor play area with plenty of space for kids to run and play.
- **Gardening Space:** Encourage responsibility and learning by establishing a family garden. It‚Äôs a great way to teach kids about nature and growing food.

### Personal Touches to Make It Homey

Personal touches in your barndominium will make it feel homey. This can include:

- **Family Photos:** Hang family photographs to celebrate moments and connections.
- **Personalized Decor:** Use items that reflect your family‚Äôs personality and heritage, creating a unique environment.
- **Shared Calendar:** Designate a space for family schedules, allowing everyone to stay informed and involved.

By focusing on these design elements, you can create a layout in your barndominium that not only meets the functional needs of your family but also provides a warm, inviting atmosphere. This space will likely become a cherished family home where memories are made and cherished for years to come.

### Conclusion

Choosing a 3 bedroom, 2 bath barndominium kit offers families a perfect blend of modern living and rustic charm. These metal homes are not only durable and energy-efficient, but they also provide ample space for family activities and a comfortable lifestyle. Families can take advantage of the open-concept design typical of barndominiums, which encourages togetherness while allowing for easy supervision of children. With a thoughtful layout, you can create designated areas for play, homework, and relaxation, ensuring that every family member feels at home.

When designing your family-friendly barndominium, consider the practical aspects of daily life. storage solutions, comfy furniture, and versatile spaces can transform your home into a functional haven. For example, having a playroom that can double as an office or a guest room allows for flexibility as your family grows and changes. Additionally, natural light plays a significant role in creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, so large windows and open spaces can enhance both the aesthetic and emotional appeal of your home.

Families today seek not just a house but a place that fosters connection and comfort. Barndominiums, with their unique blend of practicality and rustic elegance, provide an excellent path toward achieving this goal. As you explore your options, remember that a well-designed 3 bedroom, 2 bath layout can meet the diverse needs of modern families while embracing the tranquility that comes with country living. Dive into this rewarding journey of creating a family-friendly environment where cherished memories can thrive for years to come.",1,1751002964.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

mga 9pm - I was NOT hungry pero may cravings pa din so I ate a piece of bread with mushroom soup and I saw may icecream - cornetto sa ref and ended up eating it lol

take note: hindi ako gutom - and after finishing those - I didn't feel as good as before na pag nagcrave satisfied ako - last night was just like - meh

idk - cguro nakasanayan ko lang yung routine ko to eat whatever there is I see ü§£

after taking the shot ewan ko din bero na-anxiety ako thinking if it was working na ba? kung sasakit ba ulo ko and the other side effects if mararamdaman ko ba, so its kinda a mental thing ü§£ nagooverthink na nga ako lol

okay so day 2:

I don't notice any difference pa din- when I woke up 8am- nagcoffee ako as usual - no side effects pa - I slept thru the night naman. TMI - pero bowel movement is okay - which is normal for me (no constipation so far)

HUNGER/CRAVINGS? - so far wall naman

12PM - had my lunch (decided to order roasted chicken sesame salad from tokyo2 plus half or the karaaga makiritto - I felt full vs before na talagang ilang cups of rice ako.

* bulk (I love a big portion!)

* I use to think planning and prepping one meal was me winning, but winging the remaining two meals is actually a risky carb gamble - even if I intend for them to be healthy, natural, low carb
* chunky over smooth (we'll get to it down below)
* yes the prep takes some time, but I didn't have to worry about cooking for 5 days and there wasn't even a lot of dishes! Overall this is a huge time save. 
* liquid egg whites, protein supplement, chia seeds and almond milk are pricey (where I am) but considering I didn't buy any lunches / coffees / sweets I still consider the below to be budget friendly!

I made each below in batches of 5:

Breakfast (focus on protein & Fibre)
Overnight chia pot
30g chia, 50ml almond milk, 16g iso whey vanilla (I found a clean one that has 29g protein per 32g scoop). 1 cup frozen blueberries or grapefruit 
* hits my sweet tooth

Lunch - egg white fritatta 
200ml egg whites, 50g lean bacon, 0.5 cup frozen spinach, 20g feta cheese
Baked in oven for 30 mins
* super filling! 

Dinner
Any Home made healthy vegetable soup. Googled a recipe. Didn't add any cream, oil etc. Had a huge bowl every night. Midweek I made a lean lemon chicken soup. 
2 slices of toasted brown rye bread
* go chunky! You need to chew your food to increase a feeling of satiety 

During the day I still had coffee (I start off black, then have one with almond milk) and herbal teas (without milk)

I'm down 2kg (4.4pounds) since the start of the week without exercise. Ps I'm already a calory counter, gym goer, healthy BMI but could probably lose another 4-8pounds.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty and Tongue-in-Cheek Analysis: Orix Buffaloes vs. Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles (June 27, 2025)**  
*NPB‚Äôs Most Dramatic Midseason Meltdown? Probably Not. But Kyuuri‚Äôs ERA Could Melt Ice Cream.*

---

**The Setup:**  
Orix Buffaloes, 8-game league leaders with a ""we‚Äôre basically already champions"" attitude, host the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Manager Kishida, who‚Äôs probably sipping green tea and muttering about ""consistency,"" has thrown his faith behind ace pitcher **Kyuuri**, who‚Äôs been so dominant at home (1.23 ERA in 6 starts) he‚Äôs basically a cyborg. Meanwhile, Rakuten‚Äôs second baseman Sozaki is busy dreaming of All-Star Game glory, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîhe‚Äôs not here to pitch.

**Key Stats & Odds Breakdown:**

* **Orix (Home Team):** 11-7 in interleague games, 8-game lead in the league. Kyuuri‚Äôs home ERA: **1.23** (think ""Iced Coffee"" in terms of run prevention).
* **Rakuten (Away Team):** No notable injuries, but their starter isn‚Äôt mentioned. Sozaki‚Äôs All-Star hopes are as fleeting as a TikTok trend.
* **Moneyline Odds:**
   * **Orix:** \-150 (DraftKings) to -140 (Bovada) ‚Üí Implied win probability: **57-60%**
   * **Rakuten:** \+210 to +217 ‚Üí Implied win probability: **47-48%**
* **Spread:** Orix -1.5 (-270) / Rakuten +1.5 (+200).
* **Totals:** Over/Under 6.0-6.5 runs.

**The Underdog Win Rate Quagmire:**  
Baseball‚Äôs underdog win rate is **41%**, but Orix isn‚Äôt exactly a ""dog."" They‚Äôre more like a golden retriever with a 1.23 ERA and a 8-game lead. The bookmakers are pricing Orix as a **57% favorite**, but let‚Äôs split the difference between their implied 57% and the historical 41% underdog rate. That gives Orix a **49% adjusted win chance**‚Äîstill a coin flip, but with a 1.23 ERA ace on the mound? *Cue the dramatic music.*

**Injury & Player Updates:**

* **Kyuuri** is the real deal. His 3-1 record at home isn‚Äôt just luck; it‚Äôs a masterclass in ""don‚Äôt let the other team score.""
* **Sozaki** is a fan favorite, but his All-Star dreams won‚Äôt stop Kyuuri from throwing heat.
* No major injuries reported‚ÄîRakuten‚Äôs starter is a mystery, but let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre not Kyuuri‚Äôs equal.

**EV Calculations & Best Bet:**

1. **Moneyline:**
   * Orix‚Äôs EV: (0.49 \* 1.72) - 1 = **-0.05** (Negative EV).
   * Rakuten‚Äôs EV: (0.41 \* 2.1) - 1 = **-0.13** (Also negative).  
*Verdict: Both are bad bets. Don‚Äôt do it.*
2. **Spread:**
   * Orix -1.5 at -270 (implied 73% win/cover chance).
   * Adjusted for Kyuuri‚Äôs dominance: **70% chance to cover**.
   * EV: (0.7 \* 2.7) - 1 = **+0.89**.  
*Wait, that can‚Äôt be right. Let‚Äôs recalculate.*
   * Actual EV for Orix -1.5: (0.7 \* 2.7) - 1 = **+0.89**? No, that‚Äôs a typo. Correct formula: (0.7 \* 2.7) - 1 = 1.89 - 1 = **+0.89**? No, that‚Äôs still wrong. Wait, the spread payout isn‚Äôt 2.7‚Äîit‚Äôs -270, which is \~270/370 = \~73% implied. If Orix‚Äôs true cover chance is 70%, EV is (0.7 \* 1.27) - 1 = **-0.11**. Still negative. Hmm. Maybe the spread isn‚Äôt the answer.
3. **Totals:**
   * Under 6.0 at 1.83 (implied 54% chance).
   * Kyuuri‚Äôs 1.23 ERA suggests **45% chance of low scoring**.
   * EV: (0.45 \* 1.83) - 1 = **-0.15**. Also negative.

**The Real Best Bet:**  
**Orix -1.5** is the most logical play, despite negative EV. Why? Because Kyuuri‚Äôs 1.23 ERA makes the spread (-1.5) a manageable line. Rakuten‚Äôs offense? Not exactly the Yankees. Orix‚Äôs 8-game lead and Kishida‚Äôs ""we can‚Äôt afford to let our guard down"" mantra scream ""don‚Äôt bet against this team.""

**Final Prediction:**  
**Orix Buffaloes -1.5** (-270). Yes, it‚Äôs a steep line, but Kyuuri‚Äôs home dominance and Rakuten‚Äôs lack of a comparable starter make this the most data-driven play. And if you‚Äôre feeling spicy, throw in the **Under 6.0** (1.83) for good measure.

**Witty Wrap-Up:**  
Orix is like a perfectly brewed cup of matcha‚Äîconsistent, dominant, and slightly intimidating. Rakuten‚Äôs best hope is to hope Kyuuri has a ""cyborg malfunction."" But unless you‚Äôre betting on Sozaki‚Äôs All-Star dreams (spoiler: they‚Äôre not happening), stick with the Buffaloes. And if you‚Äôre a ""Bs Princess Day"" attendee, maybe skip the hot dogs and just watch Kyuuri work his magic.

*Expected Value: -0.11 (still the least bad option). Good luck, and may your bets be as sharp as Kyuuri‚Äôs fastball.* üéØ‚öæ

1lllxvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1lllxvi/how_i_ended_up_relying_on_portable_mobile_wifi/,How I ended up relying on portable mobile WiFi more than I expected,"When I first started traveling more often for work, I didn‚Äôt realize how frustrating finding a stable internet connection could be. Coffee shops aren‚Äôt reliable. Hotel WiFi is often terrible. Public WiFi? Don‚Äôt even get me started. So I started looking into **portable mobile WiFi devices** that could offer decent speed and security, especially across countries.

After going down a few rabbit holes, I landed on something called **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**.

**Why I chose to try Ryoko**

What stood out to me was the concept: a small 4G LTE pocket router that works in over 100 countries. No contracts, no long setup process. It came preloaded with a prepaid SIM card and a small data plan to get started.

To be clear, I didn‚Äôt expect miracles. I wanted something to handle work email, calls, video meetings, some browsing, and streaming when I‚Äôm on the go. A backup or portable solution, not a total replacement for my home network.

I ordered from this [**official page**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets) and had it in my hands within a week.

**Setup and first use**

Getting started was surprisingly easy. No app needed. Just charge it, power on, and connect to the network like you would any router. It worked straight out of the box in the U.S., and when I flew to Spain a few weeks later, it connected to a local carrier automatically.

No guessing, no configuring APNs. I just opened the admin dashboard through the browser to check my data balance and signal. It handled two devices (laptop and phone) at once with no slowdown.

**Day-to-day performance**

In cities, it handled Zoom, YouTube, Google Docs, and even light Netflix streaming just fine. Speeds varied depending on location, but I saw consistent 20‚Äì50 Mbps down and 10‚Äì20 Mbps up in most urban areas.

Battery lasted about 12 hours on average, longer than my phone ever did while tethering. I could throw it in my bag, leave for the day, and not worry about recharging until night.

**Things that impressed me**

* Portable size and quiet operation
* Works across multiple countries without needing a new SIM
* No surprise fees or automatic subscriptions
* Doesn‚Äôt throttle when you hit a certain data limit (as long as you pay as you go)

Data is purchased through their portal as needed. I ended up getting a larger data pack via the [**refill page here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets) when I knew I‚Äôd be away longer.

**Would I recommend Ryoko WiFi?**

It really depends on your needs.

If you‚Äôre a heavy user streaming 4K content or gaming daily, it‚Äôs not your solution. But if you‚Äôre a remote worker, digital nomad, or someone who wants a backup for spotty home internet or travel situations, it‚Äôs one of the more flexible, no-stress solutions I‚Äôve come across.

It doesn‚Äôt need complicated setup, works in most countries I‚Äôve visited, and lets you pay only for the data you need.

**A few caveats to keep in mind**

* It‚Äôs 4G, not 5G (fine for most everyday use, but worth noting)
* Speeds depend on local towers and network congestion
* Best performance happens when used with fewer devices (I capped mine at 3)

**Final thoughts**

MUAMA Ryoko WiFi wasn‚Äôt something I planned on depending on. But in the months since I started using it, I‚Äôve brought it to six countries, avoided awful hotel WiFi, and stayed connected during several outages at home.

It‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all fix, but it is a solid tool that does exactly what it promises: give you mobile internet access when and where you need it.

If you‚Äôve been frustrated by unreliable connections on the road or just want a WiFi backup with no contracts, this might be worth trying out.

Happy to hear other experiences too, especially from folks who‚Äôve used it in Asia or more remote areas. Always looking to compare notes.",1,1751002109.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

I am a 55-year old, amicably divorced man (with a 28-year old daughter who lives on her own) looking for a long-term partner.  I am bright and well-educated, I'm intellectually curious, and I have a wide variety of interests.  I'm also the type of person who generally becomes interested in the things that my partner is interested in.

I work for myself, exclusively from home, so my schedule is quite flexible, and, while I'm not wealthy, I make a decent living.  The majority of my free time is spent listening to podcasts, exercising, watching sports, watching film/TV, or hiking (day trips -- I am not much of a camper).  I love music and have sung in a large number of choirs/ensembles through the years, but I am not currently signing with any groups.

I am an introvert, but I am very socially able.  People who have just met me are almost always surprised that I describe myself as an introvert, because I am confident and outgoing in social situations.  I call myself an introvert because I prefer to spend time alone or in small groups.  I don't need a fellow introvert as a partner, as long as said partner isn't a social butterfly; I am fine doing social things 2-3 times per week -- I just require time to recharge after a social outing.

I am very progressive, both on social issues and fiscal/governmental issues, and my politics are very important to me.  Having said that, I don't need a partner who is willing to discuss politics with me (though that would be optimal); any potential partner would, however, need to lean pretty strongly to the left or we simply won't see eye-to-eye on most important issues.  I am also an atheist.  I am not anti-religion, but, it's unlikely that I would be compatible with someone who has strong religious beliefs.

I am a VERY open person -- I am happy to discuss anything about my life (current or past), as I have nothing to hide (even though I've made my fair share of mistakes).  I recognize the importance of both open communication and mutual respect.  I have strong opinions and I have no trouble expressing them, but I don't mind if  people disagree with me (unless their position has no basis in fact/reason).  I am a control freak with respect to MYSELF, but I have no interest in controlling others.  I am witty and ""punny"", I have a good sense of humor, and I have no trouble being laughed AT.  I am studious and can be very serious when the situation requires it, but I can also be a complete goofball (and, honestly, I am goofy far more often than I am serious)

Following are some facts/qualities that make me somewhat unusual (other than the length of this post):

I was an elite distance runner in HS and hoped to run for the US Olympic Team (which did not happen); I have never had an alcoholic beverage or tried any recreational drugs (I am fine with having a partner who drinks responsibly, but smoking or recreational drugs are dealbreakers); I am an incredibly picky eater -- I eat like 10 things in a ""rotation"" (so I am the polar opposite of a ""foodie"", and I spend as little time cooking as possible); I have had more surgeries than I have fingers (and I have the usual number of fingers); I have never had a cup of coffee (I don't care for the smell, and taste is 75% to 95% smell); I got perfect scores on the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT (but I am not pretentious or condescending on the least); I have had a wide variety of jobs, from bartender to sports writer to actuary to professional poker player; and I am still a very good athlete, especially at racquet sports (so I can probably help you if you aspire to become a competitive pickleball player).

My current reading list is dominated by books about neuroscience, scientific advancements, and chemistry (I am teaching myself the AP Chemistry curriculum in the hope of teaching it before long).  Some of my favorite recent shows are: ""Silo"", ""Severance"", Ted Lasso"", and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" (though I am not Jewish).  I like most movie genres, but tend to watch action movies, rom-coms, or comedies these days -- there is so much sad stuff going on in the world that I tend to prefer feel-good movies/TV.  I don't watch any ""reality TV"" (though I did watch a few seasons of ""American Idol"" and like 10 seasons of ""So You Think You Can Dance""), but I'm fine with a potential partner who does -- I don't think that ALL of a pairs' hobbies must be shared.

I am looking for a bright, intellectually curious, mature woman age 35+ who is left-leaning (at a minimum), physically active and would like to find an equal/partner.  I would like to find someone who has opinions of her own to talk about life and share experiences WITH.  I am hoping to connect via chat/message while we make sure there is common ground and the appropriate ""chemistry"", after which we can move on from Reddit.

Finally, here are couple of recent photos of me:

\[[Desmos 2D scalar fields](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ezshnooges)\]

These are two solutions to the laminarized, advectionless, pressure-less, axially-symmetric Navier-Stokes momentum equation in cylindrical coordinates that satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions (no-slip at the base and sidewall) with time dependence ([see my full derivation on r/physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ljyytm/a_solution_to_fluid_swirl_momentum_in_three/)). In other words, these solutions reflect the tangential velocity of every particle of coffee in a mug when

1. initially stirred at the core (mostly irrotational) and
2. rotated at a constant initial angular velocity before being stopped (rotational).

Dirichlet conditions for laminar, time-dependent, Poiseuille pipe flow yields¬†[Piotr Szyma≈Ñski's equation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286456645_Work_and_life_of_Piotr_Szymanski)¬†([see full derivation here](https://mikaem.github.io/MEK4300/content/chapter3/poiseuille.html#equation-eq-besselorthonormal)).

For diffusing vortexes (like the¬†[Lamb-Oseen equation](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20140003974/downloads/20140003974.pdf)) it's more complicated (see the approximation of a steady-state vortex,¬†[Majdalani, Page 13, Equation 51](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA469945.pdf)).

‚ÄúAnother nightmare?‚Äù

I nod shakily; the words stuck in my throat. Lana pats my head in an attempt to soothe me. Despite my night terrors always occurring at odd hours of the night, not once have I had to wake her.

‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù She asks gently. She already knows all that there is to it. After all, she was the one who dragged me out of that run-down apartment, promising me I would never have to see *her* again.

‚ÄúMother..‚Äù My voice comes out hoarse. I still remember her emptying bottle after bottle, blaming me for her misfortune. She was the mistress of a wealthy merchant, but lost his interest once she had me. He never showed much interest in me either- not even bothering to respond to Lana‚Äôs letter that said I would be staying with her from that day on.

‚ÄúOh, *honey*.‚Äù She hands me a glass of water, and I drink it slowly, careful not to choke on it. A soft silence fills the room.

‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt always like that, you know.‚Äù Lana‚Äôs eyes hold a strange look. ‚ÄúI do not know when she began to turn into what she-‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt *care*.‚Äù

Lana purses her lips, but does not push the topic further.

‚ÄúWould you like me to sing you a lullaby?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay..‚Äù

‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äî

Lana has never failed to surprise me. You‚Äôd think I would be used to her antics by now, considering she‚Äôs raised me since I was eight, but here we are- with her casually confessing to being a superhuman who could also turn into a monster the moment she loses her grip.

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a... beyonder?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Her gaze is unusually serious.

‚ÄúOf what pathway?‚Äù

‚ÄúSleepless.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs *that* why you‚Äôre always awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI *do* sleep from time to time, you know. Just not as much as other people.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

I stare at her. She stares back.

‚ÄúBut why are you only telling me this *now*?‚Äù I ask, feeling a little lost.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she begins slowly. ‚ÄúYou know how you‚Äôre always complaining about how there aren‚Äôt enough hours in a day?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶‚Äù

She pushes a cup of what I can only assume is some messed up attempt at making coffee towards me. It *stinks*.

‚ÄúHow are you so sure I‚Äôll agree?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, are you declining?‚Äù She asks, her face displaying faux innocence and slight hurt.

‚ÄúWait- no- I never said that! This is just‚Ä¶ a bit much to take in all at once.‚Äù I say, still reeling slightly. ‚ÄúJust give me a moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

I know she‚Äôs smiling internally, already knowing what choice I‚Äôm going to make.

And thus, under the supervision of my aunt, the *Midnight Poet*, I take the potion that officially makes me a Sleepless- a Sequence 9 on the path to Darkness.

‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äî

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, *dead*?‚Äù

The officer‚Äôs gaze does not leave me. ‚ÄúWe identified the corpse as belonging to Lana Hayes-‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it *can‚Äôt* be! She was a beyonder, she wouldn‚Äôt have died so easily! Especially not to some random serial killer! And she promised me she would‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trails off. I cannot think of any reason she would miss today other than if she really did run into trouble.

‚ÄúShe promised to give me something‚Ä¶‚Äù

He notices I do not have anything more to say. ‚ÄúA beyonder, hm?‚Äù He seems surprised at the news. ‚ÄúThat certainly provides some insight to the killer‚Äôs strength. You must understand, miss, that not even beyonders are infallible. It is a tragedy, what happened to her- and we are focusing all our efforts into catching the one who did it.‚Äù

I do not answer. He leaves; an understanding look in his eyes.

*I‚Äôll find the one behind this. I promise.*

‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äî

Nothing has really changed, since that day. I am often subject to pitying looks, and Mrs. Paige even gave me a week off from working at the bakery. I appreciate their concern‚Ä¶ but it is not what I need right now.

I feel her absence every day, but there is naught I can do about it. The police concluded that the killer had likely fled after her death, either because they had fulfilled his purpose or because they realized the authorities had increased the number of forces dedicated to their capture.

I ran into mother on the day of her will‚Äôs reading. She avoided my eyes, quickly rushing past me holding what appeared to be a picture frame. Lana left the cottage and most of her belongings to me, with some other things going to her close friends and other acquaintances.

***Dear Mist,***

***If you are reading this, I am very likely dead. Try not to grieve me too much, you know what wallowing in your own thoughts does to you. I have left the cottage to you, but don‚Äôt feel burdened to keep it. You may sell it and start over somewhere else if you wish. I have attached to this letter the formula for the*** **Midnight Poet** ***potion. Before you attempt an advancement, drain your spirituality to its limit. You will know you‚Äôre ready when you do not hear any murmurs or whispers.***

***There is another thing I must tell you: I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry for not taking you from her earlier, I‚Äôm sorry for trying to redeem her in your eyes, and I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt able to tell you this in person. I like to think of myself as someone not affected by biases, but it seems I had let my past relationship with your mother cloud my judgement. You need not do anything for her. You do not owe her anything, and you are the greatest gift she or I could have asked for. It is not your fault she failed to cherish you properly.***

***All I will ask of you is- live happily. You have many years in you yet. And know that I will be watching over you.***

***Love, Lana***

‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äîx‚Äî

I tried the method. Nearly lost control. Fun times.

Is the key to advancement really just ‚Äòwait around until the universe decides you‚Äôre ready‚Äô? That seems‚Ä¶ like a rather faulty design.

Regardless, the longer I wait here, the more time I will lose. The cottage‚Äôs sale has been finalized- netting me 750 pounds. The couple that had recently arrived in town Combined with mine and Lana‚Äôs savings, I currently possess 1250 pounds and a few soli. With that, all my affairs have been wrapped up.

A few weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop, rewatching an old interview with Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer. She talked about how *decision anxiety* and *choice paralysis* can have a long-term impact on mental health.

So I spent a few days building a small app ‚Äî mostly just for myself at first, but I realized it might help others too. Especially people with personality types like INFP, ENFP, INFJ, ISFP ‚Äî those who *feel everything*, overthink a bit, and often get stuck in loops.

It‚Äôs called **got**.

The idea‚Äôs simple:  
A minimalist decision-helper that lets you make quick either-or choices ‚Äî *Should I go out or stay in? Ramen or hotpot? Text them or let it go?*  
And it comes with a little widget that shows daily quotes from writers around the world ‚Äî calm, clear, gentle reminders to accept your choices and feel okay with moving forward.

The design is fun ‚Äî like a tiny ‚ÄúFortune Cookie Universe‚Äù floating on your iPhone screen.  
Each day, a quote gets ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù on your widget to nudge you gently toward confidence and clarity. Just one line, but sometimes that‚Äôs enough.

On the surface, got is a super simple tool.  
But underneath, it‚Äôs all about **emotional regulation, cognitive overload, and mental well-being**.

We often get stuck in the gap between two roads ‚Äî big choices like *Which university should I go to?* or *Should I accept this job offer?*,  
and tiny ones like *What to wear today?* or *Should I reply to that message?*

If you‚Äôre already torn, it means you can‚Äôt confidently predict which future will be ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù That‚Äôs when your brain starts burning willpower. And worst case? You avoid the decision entirely.

got helps you *let go of the fantasy that the ‚Äúother‚Äù path would‚Äôve been perfect.* You don‚Äôt need proof. What matters is what you do **after** the choice ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the meaning comes from.

Decision fatigue is real.  
People get stuck trying to make the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù decision, then spiral into imagining regret, blaming themselves, and freezing up.

So I built this little app to remind you:

**Whatever choice you make ‚Äî it‚Äôs the right one. Always.**

**Here‚Äôs the App Store link:** [**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/got-your-lucky-decider/id6747284309**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/got-your-lucky-decider/id6747284309)

**It‚Äôs free to try, and if you like it, there‚Äôs a Pro version for $2.99/month or $5.99/year.**

Up until now it hadn‚Äôt really concerned me, but after drifting apart for a bit we reconnected and she has told me that a married male co-worker with two children has been pursuing her (unwanted) for almost 6 months. Just for context, he is older than her and very unattractive and she is physically repulsed by him to say the least. It has all been verbal and no attempted physical contact but he does try to visit her floor frequently and even attempted to be added to a business trip she was scheduled to take. She has not reported him because he has a baby on the way and she said she would feel guilty if she got him fired. She told me she even asked him to meet with her outside the office to tell him all the inappropriate texts, emails has to stop. I blasted her for meeting with him outside of work and told her that was an idiotic thing to do because it makes it seem like they're in an actual relationship. Why on earth would you ask to meet your harasser for a coffee just to tell him it has to stop??? And of course it didn‚Äôt deter him one bit - he promised to stop then started texting her again a few days later. I also told her by letting it go on now for 6 months that HR will no doubt question why she didn‚Äôt say something sooner. In these messages he tells her he loves her, wants to be with her and is so unhappy with his wife.

The strange thing is she was recounting this all to me like oh what a funny pickle she‚Äôs in and makes sarcastic remarks/jokes about his appearance, ethnicity etc. as if this is a comedic situation vs harassment at the workplace. What is up with her EQ? Why doesn‚Äôt she understand she is a woman being harassed and why is she more protective of this scumbag and his family life vs her own safety/respect/boundaries? I would have reported him the minute the first message happened.

Help?,"So this is COMPLICATED I will try to format it sufficiently to make it easy to understand. No throwaway bc this is too specific and would be tied to me anyways so please keep this to reddit only 

Background: when I was a teenager I was a cheater. I bounced from one guy to the next. I got with Toby at fifteen. I kissed him then broke up with my LDR boyfriend the next day. We were together for 2.5 years before I had an affair with Nate. That was when I realized how bad cheating was. Toby was so heartbroken. He begged me to stay with him and be poly. But his dad was toxic (having an affair with my aunt) and I needed to move out of that house. So I left. I swore I would never cheat again because I truly did not want to leave Toby I wanted to leave our living situation. We tried to be friends after but he ghosted me a year after I left him. 

I am still close to his family because my aunt is in a triad with his parents. So our families are intertwined. When my grandma died he did the tech at her funeral and that's when we broke no contact and agreed to be friends. 

The issue: 

I am engaged to James (30M). We have a child together. We are technically in an open relationship but have no other partners due to busy lives and no one interested. His only rule is NO exes. 

I admitted to James in the beginning of our relationship that I was still VERY hung up on Toby. I told him I never stopped loving Toby. He asked if I would leave him for Toby and I said no. My cheating days are over. 

I'm visiting my family this week and Toby and I decided that since we're friends now we're going to hang out. He's taking me and my daughter for coffee and then maybe the mall after? Not sure but coffee is definitely a go. 

My fianc√© is totally comfortable with me being with Toby. I have been FREAKING OUT over this meeting because I'm terrified of my feelings for Toby leading to me doing something I regret. But Toby has agreed with me everything is platonic between us and he has no feelings for me other than familial. 

I know I do not want to throw my entire life away and ruin my daughters life over these feelings. I also know Toby now is not the Toby I was in love with as a teenager. He's become a bit more like his dad according to some family members.

I keep having intrusive thoughts of us kissing or us admitting love for each other or us doing intimate things that I'll have no opportunity for anyways. I hate myself and cringe every time but my brain won't stop. I can't sleep I can't eat I am spiraling a bit over this 

Miscellaneous: 

I know a majority of advice will be ""don't see him"" but I kinda have to cause everyone is expecting us to get along, and this is the test to see if we can handle being together. He can't come visit me with family around bc he's fighting with my dad right now and that's where I'm staying. 

My fianc√© fully trusts me. We've gone through something similar where I had a major crush on his brother Jake but still did 1on1 karaoke sessions with him. I eventually saw Jake's true colors and we stopped hanging out 1on1. So he has full confidence I won't cheat and doesn't want me to cancel hanging with Toby bc he wants me to prove to myself I won't cheat. 

Toby's family and my family know I still have feelings for him. Hell I bet Toby himself knows and is choosing to ignore it. It's something his mom and I talk about a lot and she's been supporting me through my obsessiveness / intrusive thoughts 

I recently had a suicide attempt because I hated myself so much for emotionally cheating on James. And James told me I'm not emotionally cheating on him I just have feelings I have no control over. 

I have BPD (borderline) among other neuro divergent issues so I recognize this is probably my BPD attaching myself to Toby when I don't need to bc he's familiar. I also recognize that I am overthinking the entire issue and that once I'm with Toby I'll see who he is now and my feelings will go away. I know for a fact that if I'm explicitly rejected I can turn my feelings off and file under ""never happening"" which is what happened with Jake 

The question: 

How do I keep myself in check? What boundaries do I set with myself to make this go smoothly? If you really think I should cancel, how can I cancel without letting on I have feelings for him, and maintain some semblance of being cordial for family's sake? Do you think my shame is enough to keep this platonic? 

I see him on 6/28 so if I cancel it needs to be a damn good reason but also I don't want to cancel I want to make this work.

JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure ‚Äî a name whispered not merely by commoners, but revered in the very halls of fate itself. A saga of bloodlines and battles, where sons inherit the burdens of their forebears, and stands ‚Äî these divine avatars ‚Äî arise as reflections of the soul.

Let the scholar speak: Each Stand, a heraldic beast borne of the user's resolve. Each bearer, a knight errant upon the tapestry of fate. From Phantom Blood to Golden Wind, from Steel Ball Run to Stone Ocean ‚Äî each chapter a verse in a divine opera.

Josuke, child of storm and honor, fighteth not merely for glory, but for love, for peace, for family. Jotaro, cloaked in silence and shadow, commandeth the cosmos with naught but a glance and a hat unyielding. Joseph, the trickster-sage, doth weave cunning with courage, speaking with tongue and fists alike.

And then... Dio. He who hath transcended mortality. He who hath stolen the body of the righteous and worn it like a crown. He who proclaimeth ‚Äî ‚ÄúKONO DIO DA!‚Äù ‚Äî with the arrogance of gods and the fury of fallen angels. He doth not walk, but descend, like a curse upon the world. He drinks not wine ‚Äî he drinks dominion.

But Giorno, son of dusk and dawn, riseth as the answer. He speaketh softly, yet destiny doth bend to his command. In his hand bloometh the Requiem, a power beyond comprehension. Not merely to kill ‚Äî but to undo, to deny, to rewrite reality itself. In that final moment, the tyrant learneth despair. Dio‚Äôs ambitions dissolve not in blood, but in the silence of inevitability. For Requiem knoweth no mercy.

Still, the wind doth carry the echo of ‚ÄúWRYYYYYY‚Äù, And the sound of ORA and MUDA yet rings in the hearts of those who remember.

Let it be sung, in the libraries and throne rooms, in carriages and coffee houses, on battlefields and lonely shores ‚Äî That JoJo is no mere entertainment, But a scripture of resolve, A testament of lineage, A cathedral of the will.

And if one, in this or any age, should utter, even in jest, the sacred line ‚Äî ‚ÄúIs that a JoJo reference?‚Äù ‚Äî then look upon him not with scorn, but with reverence.

What we've witnessed, the deployment of state-funded goons, sanctioned police brutality, the rape of women, battery of innocent citizens, close-range executions, and the killing of students, are not mere political missteps. They are crimes. And any regime that allows or enables such atrocities has lost legitimacy in the eyes of reason and justice.

That said, we cannot afford to lose the plot in our pursuit of accountability.

What is currently happening with CITAM is not resistance it‚Äôs emotional speculation. People are dragging the name of a church, an entire institution, without any verified evidence. Where is the person who was allegedly turned away at the gate? Who are the eyewitnesses? CITAM made a public statement, where is the counterproof? Instead of pressing for facts, people are bypassing due diligence and jumping straight to outrage.

We cannot afford this kind of shortcut thinking. This is how real movements lose credibility.

Tearing down institutions based on viral mood swings isn‚Äôt activism, it‚Äôs laziness wrapped in anger. If you're truly fighting for justice, your fight must be rooted in truth, not rumor. Your demands must be sharper than your rage.

Here‚Äôs what nobody wants to admit, sometimes, our side also gets it wrong. And when that happens, we must correct course, not double down on propaganda. A failed tactic doesn‚Äôt justify deception. It demands reflection, re-strategy, and integrity. Vile kalala alisema back to the drawing board, restructure..

If you're serious about systemic change, then you must be serious about facts. Otherwise, you're just mimicking the very systems you're trying to dismantle.

Call out the state. Demand accountability. But don't throw logic out the window just because it‚Äôs emotionally convenient. Otherwise, you become noise, and the real criminals in power? They thrive in that noise.

Shout out to everyone who showed up, those who shared water, offered rides, treated strangers, or simply stood their ground. You‚Äôre the real heroes, not the ones in suits reading pressers.

Will you hold my heart and I can call you my home?,"Sorry for the cheesy line above, haven't had some good cheese on a pizza in a while. Please bear with me and take a few minutes to read through. Thank you.

I'm a simple 5'8 bengali guy navigating through life and it's difficulties one day at a time. Pretty logical, practical and straight forward guy but kind of a hopeless romantic at heart stuck in the 90's unable to fit into this dating and hookup culture of today. Bit of an introvert who doesn't talk a whole lot socially, I'm someone who would love to yap with you on anything and everything.

**More insights on me:**

\- I love binge watching movies, shows etc (though I don't get much time these days)

\- Into gymming and sports. Currently enjoy playing badminton weekly. Would love if you would join me for a workout or a game of shuttles

\- Love long drives (especially with family) with music on and yapping about things. Destination is not important, the journey is.

\- I have a playful, childish side ‚Äî one of my love languages is to playfully annoy and bother you

\- Eggitarian, left meat few years back

\- Big time animal lover, hence the renouncing of meat

\- Spiritual/Religious (Hindu), really like visiting temples and soaking in the energies

\- Abhor smoking, drink very rarely and socially -> can forego if it's a requirement for you

\- I know and can do all chores around the house.. mom raised me right.. I don't ever shy away from responsibilities

\- more in store for you to explore and figure out, nothing erratic or out of ordinary though

**My bad habits-**

I'll probably approach and pet that cow on the road if I see one. dogs too.

I need a long time to properly get to my senses in the morning.. I'll be holding you captive till then

I may whine like a child if I'm sleep deprived or hungry.

I'll send you a lot of reels

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

Someone to call my home. Someone who I can bury my head into after a long and tiring day. Someone who believes in building a relationship brick by brick, doesn't shy away from having the harder conversations and willing to work through things. My partner in crime, my best friend, who‚Äôs calm, emotionally mature, and is my rock and anchor. Looking for warmth, laughter, and the kind of love that grows stronger with time with all the highs and lows.

Brownie points for nerdy, geeky and intellectual conversations. I love ingesting trivial pieces of information about anything, which I'll bombard you with too. Do I remember it all? Nope.. which brings me to, I'm quite forgetful, but I won't forget any important dates tho, be it your bdays, our anniversary or your parents's bdays.. If you were to ask me if I remember what you wore on our last date, I'd probably be scrambing to find an answer. I would likely remember something cute or embarassing you did 10yrs back or so tho..haha..

I‚Äôm looking to get married within 1-2 years and definitely want kids in the future. Also jfyi, I won't be asking for dowry/gifts and I'd prefer a small private marriage, not a gala.

**Partner Preferences-**

Religion: Hindu

Age: 24-28

Height: <=5'7

Spiritual/Religious

Occupation: Would prefer someone who's not stuck in the corporate 9-5 rut like me, but mostly anything is fine.

Loves animals -> I have found that people who love animals are generally more empathetic and compassionate, so it's a plus

Community: I would love to be a part of yours and I expect you to welcome bengali culture too. The more festivals we can celebrate together, the better.

I would like someone who believes in family values, wants to have a family of her own and has dreams/visions of a marriage and life after, not just a wedding. It's just me and my mom and she's one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. So, I need someone who isn't tainted by the idea that all MILs are abusive towards their DILs or all guys are mumma's boys if they live with their parents. My mom has always wanted a daughter, so you'll be treated as such. Your parents are my parents too (I'm great with parents, yes will be with yours too) and I expect you to love my mom as your own too.

**Why marry me:**

\- If your idea of fun looks something like going on a hike, going for a drive or travel occassionally or explore places, be at home and spend time with family etc. instead of clubbing, partying, socializing extensively

\- Lifetime supply of cuddles and massages

\- If you're someone who would like to stay awake late in the night with a cup of coffee talking, binge watching something or watching stupid reels together

\- If you believe in building something solid, a relationship from the ground up, nurture it like a sapling and watch it grow into a strong tree standing tall

So he disappeared off and fucked a prostitute . This isn't the first time nor the second time. It is now the 3rd and 4th time with the same woman. He said I was part to blame for pissing him off in the first place which triggered his action. But really? Are you kidding me? So if i get upset, is it right for me to go and f* with someone else? 

Then he tell me on that day when we argued, he stormed off and fucked her twice: morning and then again in the evening. He also added he asked her to eat lunch with him. And also met up again to have a coffee. He said he paid for sex and she treated lunch and coffee. He said she doesn't seem like she's seeing someone else - until now I'm still thinking wtf, she's a whore. People pay her for sex and that's how they met. So he now tells me he doesn't know if they were starting to get serious!? Wtf. U think u're dating a whore? 

After that day I found a pack of girlie tissue in his bag whilst I was tidying. 

When he told me all of this I just couldn't take it anymore. My tears were flooding out of my eyes like a waterfall. I dropped down to my knees and wrapped myself up into a ball and started crying. I ran to the toilet to have a shower.

When I finished showering, he came and asked to suck his dick. And he showed exactly how they did it. I don't know what else to feel anymore. What would you do if you were me?",1,1750999414.0,Divorce,14,0.6,False

(guy you help in lunar quest find his courage)



the fight would require players to skill in the arena while the npc's fight the boss, your mainly a support role so using potion share/heal other will be heavily relied on durring the fight.



there would be 5-10 npcs and 5 players recommended max 10 players.



so the fight takes place in the dream world where the monster has come back to terrorize the lunar folks with terrifying nightmares fueled by the shadows of erebus.

will you toss and turn in your sleep sweating buckets?

or will you find the courage to fight what torments you in the dark!

now that there is a basis for this fight, how would the battle on your dreams play out?



drop your suggestions below!



elixer of dream light, how would it be made and with what?

.

what would the area look like?

.

what would the boss/minions look like?

.

these are suggestions, may or may not be chosen as mechanics for the fight.

. (edited)

\[8:39 PM\]

would be cool if it had rotation mechanics like vorago but we will see, if done this way the rotation of mechanics will be upto j mods to choose.



mechanic #1 



should be darkness, where it gets dark like arraxor fight, with light shafts of safety where the darkness hasnt been able to penetrate this part of the dream.



mechanic #2



night terrors, cause all players to randomly run around for short periods if moving or if standing it will make you cower in place.



(unable to assist others, can get hit by random attacks from boss)



mechanic #3



flood of horror! a bunch of things spawn at this point you will actually do combat but the catch is the npc's will bind you to them to give them the courage to fight in this instance you will become the lunar npc's (mental transfer) and you must kill the flood before it over runs your party!



this would be a portal(s) you have to take out, where the flood would be pouring out of.



mechanic #4



shadow barrage, Ancient Magicks shadow barrage like at angel of death but, these are horrifyingly bigger (2x2 shadows, 3x3?)



mechanic #5



shadow clones, hmm youll have to make an elixer of dream light durring the fight and throw them at your shadow clones to kill them.



mechanic #6



IF shadow clones are not taken out they (players) of the clones will become sabetours fighting for erebus against your team!  embrace the darkness!!!



if this scenario plays out you must survive the other players attacking you (they will walk, you can run), they will do dmg to you and you can fight them using elixer of dream light to cleanse them of the darkness! ... if you can stay alive long enough to make a few elixers otherwise good luck!



to prevent abuse, the player will automatically walk towards another player, you can cycle who u target, for solo this will be a clone like from kerapacs fight of yourself!



there will be a 10 second cooldown for target cycling, to further prevent abuse this timer may be adjusted for balancing (edited)



saint blair

OP

 ‚Äî 6/1/2025 9:08 PM

\^this is to signify that you still have some control fighting erebus as he has a grasp over your body.



mechanic #7



quest giver, your a quest giver being assailed by impatient rude adventurers wanting a reward without the effort of doing anything for it. (this is a bit tricky)

wracks brains

you must give them a reward that they will appreciate otherwise your sanity will go down, when your sanity runs out you will fail the fight.



there will be 10 items to choose from as a reward item to give spawned on the ground.



mechanic #8



black abyss (darkest of darks)

pure anxiety inducing blindness of darkness, 10 sec?, 20 sec?, you will be forced to dodge attacks while completely blind, how gut wrenchingly scary!



mechanic #9







\-------------------------------------------------------------

hmm...(ponders staring into the black abyss of darkness)

give your ideas on what mechanics you can come up with! (edited)

\[9:08 PM\]

\-------------------------------------------------------------

MINIONS IN FIGHT



to fight the minions, youll target the monster & then encourage the npc to attack it, you can use lunar spells to assist the npc and/or use potions of dream light and throw it at the monster to debuff it & do some damage.



\--------------------



lucid dreams (when killed buffs the npc's attack)



nightmares/night terrors (if not killed soon enough will debuff npc's & hit players with a random effect of fear \[unknown amt of hits over unknown amt of time\])



daydreams (when killed buffs the npc's defence)



false awakenings (if not killed fast enough will cause progress in fight to move backwards to previous check point)



recurring dreams (if not killed fast enough will buff boss with chasing & falling effect that can hit players with 1 or the other randomly but not both at same time, (i.e player 1 will get hit by chasing dream or falling dream, player 2 will get hit by chasing or falling dream)



chasing: while being chased you dont want to get hit.



falling: while falling dream will cause you to feel like your falling (like at vorago going floor to floor)



healing dreams (if killed fast enough will heal npc's)



prophetic dreams (if killed fast enough will allow you to see the next mechanic ahead of time \[unshure length\])



symbolic dreams (im really not shure....)









.

im playing this out in my mind w/o an actual arena layout with gathering spots.... shudders my GOD THE HoRrOr!!!!! may Saradomin save us!



please give suggestions for gathering spots/materials for creation of the ""elixer of dream light"" (edited)

acheivment: throw a cup of ""coffee"" at the boss.  (title: time to wake up!/nothing like a nice cup of ouch!) (edited)

\[11:04 PM\]

====================================================



unique rewards:

(vivid dreams effect: allows you to set a combat spell from another spellbook, if runes are stored for it in the pouch you will be able to cast it regardless of spellbook you are on.)



dream weavers thread + time runes + grasping rune pouch = dream weavers rune pouch (has vivid dreams effect + 25% chance to not consume runes) (holds 6 types of runes)



dream weavers thread + expansive pouch + grasping rune pouch (painful idea) =  bag of nightmares (has vivid dreams effect + 25% chance to not consume runes) (holds upto 8 types of runes)





thanks ""captain rex"" for pushing me to think of a way to make an 8 rune pouch!

In other words, these solutions reflect the tangential velocity of every particle of coffee in a mug when 

1. initially stirred at the core (mostly irrotational) and 
2. rotated at a constant initial angular velocity before being stopped (rotational).

Dirichlet conditions for laminar, time-dependent, Poiseuille pipe flow yields¬†[Piotr Szyma≈Ñski's equation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286456645_Work_and_life_of_Piotr_Szymanski)¬†([see full derivation here](https://mikaem.github.io/MEK4300/content/chapter3/poiseuille.html#equation-eq-besselorthonormal)).

For diffusing vortexes (like the¬†[Lamb-Oseen equation](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20140003974/downloads/20140003974.pdf))... it's complicated (see the approximation of a steady-state vortex,¬†[Majdalani, Page 13, Equation 51](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA469945.pdf)).

I condensed \~23 pages of handwriting (showing just a few) to 6 pages of Latex. I also made these colorful graphics in desmos - each took an hour to render.

Lastly, I collected some data last year that did not match any of my predictions due to (1) not having this solution and (2) perturbative effects disturbing the flow. In addition to viscous decay, these boundary conditions contribute to the torsional stress at the base and shear stress at the confinement, causing a more rapid velocity decay than unconfined vortex models, such as Oseen-Lamb's. Gathering data manually was also a multi-hour pain, so I may use PIV in my next attempt.

1llkwak,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1llkwak/okay_soo_there_are_some_strange_things_happening/,Okay soo‚Ä¶ there are some strange things happening here.,"I started eating 20-25 net carbs per day roughly two weeks ago. I am well within my calorie deficit (no breakfast, no snacks, something very little for lunch and one bigger meal in the evening containing meat, cheese and maybe a slice of keto bread. Or keto donut, whichever I made beforehand. I stopped eating sugar, I put erythriol in my black coffee or I just drank double espressos. No cheating. When we are eating out in a group I am ordering meat with veggies and no sauce.

So‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I feel like I am nauseous some days, I have a really weird tension in my stomach area, not gonna lie, I am slightly constipated too, but what is the strangest thing is I a can‚Äôt sleep more than a few hours every day. I work in the late afternoons until midnight or one, and sometimes I only can fall asleep by 10 am, but I really have to force it. I get up at 14.30. And after getting over the grogginess, I am sort of fine throughout the day. 

It feels like I am not tired. I obviously take supplements too with this diet, I try to drink more water, etc.

And unfortunately it did seem like I gained weight. I‚Äôm not sure because I didn‚Äôt check but when I look into the mirror, I look slightly bigger. I am a bit sad snd disheartened to continue.

Did these things happen to anyone? Will they pass? What could I do to improve things?

I asked the same thing and it was ‚Äújust some girl‚Äù but SHE got an actual answer when she asked). I don‚Äôt know if I should just quit, because anytime I make a mistake they either laugh at me to themselves or they genuinely straight up yell at me over it. I‚Äôm trying really hard but when they ask me the measurements I get so nervous I say the wrong thing even when I know the answer and one of the girls whispered ‚Äúoh this girls stupid‚Äù even in front of a customer. The last time I was bullied like this, I was fired shortly after for ‚Äúnot being a team player‚Äù and im scared because I need the job. I wish people weren‚Äôt like this. My parents just tell me to get over it but after work i just cry over how sweet they are to the new coworker while they treat me like absolute shit. And im the only one too, btw.

1llktuq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llktuq,"My dieffenbachia is wilty and crusty tips, what do i doooooo","This is Jett. I‚Äôve had him since last year since last year in like March ish as a small new baby, and grown very well until recently. I made a post to r/houseplants asking the same thing and I have attempted some advice. For context, right here on the coffee table, a west facing window which gets decent light during the day. He was doing good there for a while until he started not doing well. the leaves were drooping until they eventually all drooped like shown in these pictures, a few of the large and medium leaves have crusted tips, and often do i find the small leaves closer to the base of the plant turn yellow and die before even reaching to the point of getting the white splotches on them. 

I have tried a few things for the past couple months: 
- moved him to the back of the living room where there is a tiny bit less light, that resulted in one of the large leaves turning yellow and dying.
- moved him slightly closer to the window to see if perhaps he needs more sun because i seen somewhere that perhaps he needs more energy or something (like i said above)
- started only watering when i stick my finger in the dirt and feel that most of it is dry.
- occasionally i mist the leaves with a spray bottle

He sits in that black pot which is inside of that white pot, and i have mulch on the bottom of the white pot that the black pot sits on top of for drainage, if that means anything. i‚Äôm not sure if mulch is a good idea or if i should try something else or what. 

Anyway, pleaaase help. Jett is my therapy plant and i really need him to stay alive or idk what id do. If anyone knows what to do or how to help, please please do let me know. thanks!!",1,1750998273.0,plantclinic,1,1.0,False

I also eat without any screens in front of me. The food tastes so much better when I focus on it. I‚Äôve even started to truly enjoy doing nothing at all.

In Hypertensive crisis. Dr advised me to go to ER so I did. After one set of meds failed to bring my number down they hooked me up to an IV drip that delivered a BP lowering med directly into my blood stream. My BP reduced significantly. I had a number of other tests. Catt, stress test, heart echo, lung ultrasound all came back with positive results. My BP remained low and I departed. Since I have been in a permanent state of light headedness. If I stay on my feet for a period of time I feel wobbly, I knocked a full cup of coffee over in work (unusual for me) this morning. I‚Äôm just not 100% and I don‚Äôt like it. My usual 170/110 BP reading is now consistently in the 120‚Äôs /90‚Äôs which is great but I just don‚Äôt feel right.
