1middiu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1middiu,Help me choose a layout,"We are about to renovate our 90s kitchen, but I'm really struggling with maxing out space without the kitchen feeling crowded. My husband and I are big cooks and the current closed layout has been horrible for us in so many ways (tiny, no storage, no counter space).

We are able to open and expand the kitchen about two feet to give us more storage/prep room without encroaching too far into the living area. Unfortunately, we can't move the exterior back door (historic district requirements), which seems like it would have solved a lot of our problems.

Budget can be anywhere from $50k-$100k -- we've been saving up to do this for a while. The house has no formal dining room, hence the inclusion of a banquette.

Here are my thoughts on the layouts so far:

**Option #1** 

* Love the coffee bar and pantry cabinet 
* Easy to set up external ventilation for our range (currently it has none)
* Opportunity to make the range/range hood a nice focal point in the room 
* Worried that the back door will feel too blocked off 
* Refrigerator sticking out might seem awkward, even if we do steal space from the interior wall 
* Less space around the range for pots/pans, very similar to our current setup

**Option #2** 

* Only need to pay to move the gas line and setup ventilation 
* Love the prep space around the range 
* Layout feels more open, might not be as ""blocked off"" near the door 
* Coffee bar is lost (we are ""home baristas"", so this hurts) 
* Unhappy with the refrigerator/corner cabinet pairing currently, not sure if it will feel different with this layout

I've been looking at these layouts forever and feel stuck. Any preferences between the two? Anything you'd do differently? We really need the space, but I don't want to invest significant money only to make the house feel more cramped.

\---------

**Other things to note:**

* The interior wall that has no cabinets currently is load-bearing. We're unable to steal space from that direction as there is a small bedroom on the other side
* The back door is an exterior dutch door that leads to an outdoor cooking area/stone patio 
* My dad is a master plumber, so we are able to make changes to water/gas lines easily",1,1754410209.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

1mid7oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1mid7oq/at_a_loss/,At a loss,"I adopted my miniature poodle (3m) in March of this year. I already had two minis at home (7f and 14f). I am his third home. Apparently an owners illness sent him into rescue and he was returned by his second home due to several bite incidents. The rescue told me that they believed the incidents were not his “fault” and that inexperienced owners tried to take items from him without trading. Those owners commented on the rescue’s Facebook post about the incident and indicated that they were experienced owners and that they believed he was a severe resource guarder. I didn’t see that post until he was already in my home.

He came to me very underweight and suffering from dry eye. He is now on a prescription diet and has undergone neuter revision surgery. He is on feed through medication for the dry eye because he bit me (no warning-did not break the skin) when I was trying to use ointment on him. Since I got him he has stolen multiple items and guarded them, lunging/snapping at me if I inadvertently walk too close and he has gone after my older, smaller dog, requiring me to break up the fight before he could hurt her. He has also lunged/snapped at me for interrupting him while he is licking himself (I didn’t touch him, just walked into the room). He has also bitten me for patting him while he was on the couch (no warning- did not break the skin).

We have worked with a trainer and I have read “Mine”. We had to stop training because he needed time to heal from his revision surgery. He is inbred and his healing time is slow. His resource guarding has been improving - he doesn’t lunge/snap as easily and doesn’t always growl if I walk by. I have done everything I can think of to manage him. I have removed all items from my coffee tables and end tables that he could steal. I keep him separated from my old dog with baby gates. I don’t have many people over anymore and I don’t sit on the couch so he isn’t tempted to climb up there with me. My other dogs come to work with me but I don’t want him to bite anyone so I have a dog walker come everyday. 

I recently sent him to stay with family for a week so that I could go away. This morning I got a call that he bit a family member. He broke the skin and, although the bite was only a finger, it is deep and very painful looking. Apparently she was patting him while he was licking his feet and he showed his teeth, but she didn’t realize he was warning her. He didn’t growl before he bit her.

I’m exhausted. He gave her more warning than he usually does so that is improvement, but the bites are getting worse. I love him but it is really hard to live with him. I don’t know if it is time to call the rescue but I feel like I have failed. I am several thousand dollars into medical treatment but the vet says some issues are likely genetic due to the inbreeding.

1mid73t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeGearReviews/comments/1mid73t/explore_if_the_buenicoo_portable_air_conditioner/,Explore if the Buenicoo Portable Air Conditioner BW-102Y lives up to the hype review,"The BUENICOO BW-102Y portable air conditioner landed in my life just in time to tackle a relentless summer heatwave. With its compact dimensions (10.6 x 9.8 x 23.2 inches) and manageable 7.5-pound weight, it seemed like the ultimate solution for a sweltering home office setup. After using it daily, here’s an unfiltered look at this model’s features, quirks, and overall performance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right from the start, this portable air conditioner impressed me with its sleek, minimalist silhouette and white ABS exterior that felt durable to the touch. It didn’t scream “appliance” in a way that clashed with my decor, which I count as a win. Its compact size meant I could easily tuck it into corners or wheel it between rooms—those 360° wheels became my best friend on busy days. It’s sturdy too; once accidentally bumping into it while juggling coffee and my laptop still didn’t shake it. The personal form factor isn’t just convenient; it’s welcomed when space is at a premium.  

**Performance and Cooling Efficiency**  
This thing isn’t messing around when it comes to cooling. The 60W motor paired with a larger air outlet made a noticeable difference in airflow. On the lowest of its three speeds, the cool breeze was both consistent and far-reaching. Using the automatic 60° swing kept the air circulating evenly, which was especially handy in my oddly-shaped living room. For nights when the heat bordered on unbearable, adding ice packs to either the top or bottom 2.5-gallon water tank took cooling to another level. 

[Check BUENICOO BW-102Y price on Amazon.](https://ehomeco.com/p/b0dqkgxq75/)

**Energy Efficiency**  
A significant bonus of this portable air conditioner was its energy efficiency. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting it to hold its own against larger units, but it surprised me. There’s no installation required, and that plug-and-play simplicity saved on both setup costs and my electricity bill. Plus, its low energy consumption made running it guilt-free—even during overnight use. For anyone struggling to justify the cost of central air conditioning, this model provides a solid alternative.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
The device’s remote control is a lifesaver, offering me total freedom to stay comfortably seated or sprawled on the couch without unnecessary interruptions. When I inevitably misplace the remote (who doesn’t?), the responsive touchscreen fills in perfectly. Another clever touch: the screen auto-dims after a couple of minutes, which greatly helped my light-sensitive eyes during late-night study marathons. Its 1 to 7-hour timer adds customization options too. I set it to shut off just after I fall asleep, which has made nights much quieter and smoother.

**Advantages**  
- Bladeless design makes it child- and pet-safe.  
- Nearly noiseless at just 50 dB—ideal for light sleepers.  
- Dual water tank design allows for ease of refill.  
- Stays cool for over 24 hours when fully filled.  

**Negative Attributes**  
- Doesn’t provide the seemingly instant temperature drop you’d expect from traditional AC units.  
- Not sufficient for significantly large rooms or open spaces.  
- Needs frequent cleaning of the removable reservoir to avoid unpleasant odors.  

**Challengers**  
Comparing it to other portable air conditioners, I found its silent operation and bladeless design to be genuine standouts. Competing products like Honeywell’s or Black + Decker’s models often focus on raw cooling power but can fall short when it comes to noise reduction. On the flip side, larger units by those brands sometimes handle broader space coverage more effectively, which is worth considering if cooling a large area is top priority.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For everything it offers, the price sits comfortably against the value provided. Sure, it won’t turn your entire home into an arctic chill zone. Still, factoring in its energy efficiency, ease of use, and safety features, it’s clearly designed for specific, budget-conscious consumers looking for accessible cooling solutions. At this sweet price point, it’s almost hard to say no.

If you’ve been following me for more than a few weeks, you *know* how I feel about Taijuan Walker (3.82 ERA). Seeing his name on the schedule is almost a guarantee that I throw money down on a high-scoring game; the man has allowed 7 HRs in his last 3 starts, and the Over has cashed easily in 4 of his last 5 outings. I'm on this game to see at least 10 runs.

He often wakes me up minutes before my alarm for work. But when I ignored my alarm and decided not to get up for work today, he sat beside me on my bed and watched me for awhile. A few hours later I got out of bed and went to make coffee, breakfast...etc. And he has followed me everywhere I went. Even to the restroom 🙄 ( I know, typical right? ). But this guy is on my heels every step I take. I decideded to rest on the couch, and after I settled he jumped up here with me and wiggled his way around my feet, and this is a picture of his decision. 

Im posting this because I hope people realize how much cats care and love their people. My BF is convinced that cats dont care about you. Although I try to explain to him that cats clearly do care, he can't see it. But cats do care, folks. You just need to learn how they express their love for you. 🐱🩷",4,1754409697.0,cats,0,1.0,False

1mid4pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1mid4pt/reta_is_a_miracle_for_me_except_one_thing/,Reta is a miracle for me (except one thing),"I went on Reta 3 weeks ago. 1mg per week (two 0.5mg shots per week). Was dealing with some alcohol issues (nothing crazy, just saw my drinking slowly escalating and wanted a break) and needed to lose about 20 lbs as well. Day 1, zero craving of alcohol, havent had a sip since. I would start craving it massively at 4pm every single day - and would give in 3-4 times a week. My food intake is way down and have lost 7ish lbs. The best part - more energy. On about day 3 I thought to myself 'this cant be real, this is a miracle peptide'. I tried Semaglutide a year ago, and I lost weight but had no energy, massive nausea and depression and for some reason craved alcohol more, not less. So I went off of it. 

My only issue - sleep. I have never had an issue sleeping, whether I was drinking, sober, exercise, coffee, no coffee, blue light glasses, hot bath, cold bath doesnt matter. The past 3 weeks I lay awake exhausted until 3am every single night and wake up at 7. Im in hell. 

I have seen other posts about sleep, I cant seem to solve it, I have tried seemingly everything except prescription sleeping pills. 

My question - the people that have experienced this - did it pass after a month or so? Is there anything u can do to mitigate this? People have spoken about blood sugar drops but I tried eating a bunch of honey before bed and it did nothing, yes I tried magnesium, I tried no magnesium, I made my room cold, all the Huberman shit, Im at my wits end. Maybe I will try tirzapeptide? I dont really want to because Reta has been so good besides this factor. 

Any advice/experience is helpful. 

thanks

My NCLEX saga,"My NCLEX journey felt like scaling a mountain with no summit in sight. Fresh out of nursing school, I was a bundle of nerves and ambition, armed with stacks of flashcards and endless cups of coffee. The weight of the exam loomed large my dream of becoming a registered nurse hinged on this moment.

I studied relentlessly, my bedroom a fortress of textbooks and practice questions. Late nights blurred into early mornings, and self-doubt crept in like an unwelcome guest. I’d ace practice tests one day, then bomb them the next. My friends, bless them, rallied with encouragement, but the pressure was mine alone to bear.Test day arrived, a crisp morning that felt heavier than it should. The computer screen stared back, each question a new hurdle. My heart raced as the test shut off at 85 questions had I passed or failed? The agonizing wait for results stretched days into eternity. I replayed every answer, second guessing myself into a frenzy.

When the email arrived, I held my breath. “Pass.” One word unleashed a flood of relief and joy. I’d done it conquered the NCLEX and earned my RN title. Looking back, that journey wasn’t just about passing a test; it was about resilience, grit, and believing in myself when the odds felt stacked against me.

I was with my girlfriend for almost a year in a strange, complicated kind of relationship. After she left me, I won’t lie, I fell apart. Sleepless nights, pain, sadness, and suffering. But I also knew, deep down, that all of this was part of my journey to grow into a better man. In those days, I even cursed the day I met her, because everything I knew seemed to collapse. But what I didn’t realize then… was what was waiting for me on the other side. Before that, I was just like any other young guy, parties, going out, girls, work, hopping from one coffee to another, empty conversations, no real direction. But after that breakup, my mind went through a total reset.

I knew I had to change everything. I stopped using my phone like before. I focused on personal growth. I started training hard, eating better. I began reading books, something I never did before, and even writing down what I did each day to stay accountable. Most importantly, I found God. I reconnected with prayer and that spiritual part of myself that I’d been ignoring. The struggle lasted a long time, but each day I could see the change in me. And yeah… I started writing down everything I learned. Just reflections and tools that helped me, maybe someday they’ll help someone else too. Eventually, I started my own business, one I still run today. I haven’t seen a doctor or taken a single pill in 20 months. I try to live by God’s design now. I wake up early, I’m more productive than ever, and I’ve built new routines that shape my days. I know it hurts. And I know it’s tough. But I truly believe God puts that pain in our lives as a tool for growth. If this hadn’t happened to me, I would’ve never become who I am today. I don’t live for someone else. I have freedom. I have time. I have peace. If you’re going through something similar, just know you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Keep going.

Did I make the right choice?","I (21F) recently moved out of the house I shared with my narcissistic mother and some relatives. Living there was emotionally exhausting. My mom often yelled at me, criticized me constantly, and our fights would escalate with other relatives siding with her. It made me isolate myself — I used to stay in my room all day, avoiding everyone, only coming out late at night when everyone was asleep.

I finally moved out a few days ago, hoping to focus on my studying. But now that I live alone, I’m overwhelmed with loneliness. I find myself checking my phone to see if my mom or brother messaged me, even though we fought all the time. I feel lost — part of me wants to go back just to not feel so alone and save money on rent and food, but another part knows I’ll just end up mentally drained again.

I’ve started working part-time at a coffee shop, but I struggle with being slow, shy, and anxious. I get scolded a lot and I’m scared I’m not good enough. People say I’m “too quiet” or “too soft,” but deep down I know it’s trauma-related. I want to get better, but I don’t know how.

I feel like I’m in between — not stable enough to live alone comfortably, but not emotionally safe to return home either. I’m tired, hungry, overwhelmed, and unsure what to do next. I just needed to get this off my chest.

1mid1xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mid1xj/does_this_best_coffee_maker_zojirushi_ecytc100xb/,Does this best coffee maker Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB live up to the buzz?,"Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB—just another coffee maker? Not quite. As someone who runs on caffeine and regularly experiments with every possible way to make a decent cup of joe, I had to dive into this one. This model promises some standout features, and over the weeks of testing, I came to trust its capabilities—but honestly, it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows.

**Modern Design and Compact Footprint**

One of the first things that caught my eye was how sleek and modern it looked. Sitting somewhere in the middle of “futuristic” and “kitchen workhorse,” the dimensions are just right, measuring 8 inches deep, 10.63 inches wide, and roughly 14.88 inches tall. It fits comfortably on a moderately cluttered countertop—trust me, I’d know because I have gadgets overcrowding my kitchen—and it doesn’t take away too much real estate.

Everything from the stainless-steel finish to the black accents screams sophistication yet simplicity. Cleaning it is a breeze, and it doesn’t seem to collect fingerprints as much as other stainless-steel appliances I’ve tested. Plus, its thermal carafe’s tapered design ensures you won’t awkwardly drip coffee all over the place, something I used to do often enough to make a mess my brand.

**Good Points**

- Brews at an optimal 200°F temperature, ideal for rich flavor extraction.
- Includes a reusable stainless mesh filter that’s washable.
- The carafe keeps coffee hot for hours, saving me from reheating during late-night work hours.
- Has an iced coffee-specific setting for hardcore summer enthusiasts.
- Lightweight and easy-to-use detachable water tank simplifies filling.

[Check Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b07b83dgmv/)

**Brewing Quality and Performance**

This bad boy does not mess around when it comes to coffee quality. Rated to handle up to 10 cups of hot coffee or a concentrated brew for up to 5 cups of iced coffee, it consistently delivered smooth flavor without being watered down. The reusable stainless mesh filter adds an eco-friendly bonus—perfect for avoiding the hassle of buying paper filters, though you can use them if you’re old-school.

I tested its 200°F brewing temperature claim, and it checks out. The coffee produced feels flavorful, rich, and not overly bitter. I threw my fanciest ground coffee at it—my relatives have intense opinions on coffee—and even the coffee snobs nodded in approval. The iced coffee mode has a specific reduced water setting to account for dilution once poured over ice. It felt like I was drinking from a fancy café rather than something I made half-asleep.

**Flexible Features for Daily Use**

Quick, programmable settings make this machine a life-saver. With a timer on board, you can set it up the night before, so your coffee is waiting for you in the morning. There’s also a time-saving feature that brews faster; I used this on multiple groggy mornings, and there’s no compromise on quality.

The removable water tank is another genius move. It saves struggling with pouring water into confined spaces. You can just detach and refill it. My housemate once managed to jam water all over our counter using a machine without removable tanks, so this one’s idiot-proof. The buttons are responsive, though they lack a higher-end tactile feel. Still, nothing complicated about the interface—it’s literally “press and make.”

**Limitations**

- Takes a bit longer to fully brew on its standard setting.
- The design is somewhat dated compared to flashier brands.
- Lacks app connectivity or smart-home integration.
- At nine pounds, moving it around feels cumbersome.

**How It Stacks Up to Competitors**

Comparing this coffee maker to rival brands such as Breville or Cuisinart’s models, the Zojirushi stands out with its vacuum-insulated thermal carafe. Some high-end rivals offer glass carafes instead, which pale when it comes to keeping coffee hot for hours. However, in terms of programmability, certain Breville models offer a bit more user-friendliness and better brewing options. 

Where it might fall short is its lack of technology “wow” factors like app-based controls or automatic brewing adjustments, seen in some pricier competitors. But if you’re more about solid reliability over tech frills, the Zojirushi holds its ground.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Fair question: is this worth its cost? I found its features to balance the price point pretty well. The machine excels in delivering quality coffee day after day without leaning heavily on gimmicks. It’s designed for someone like me—who appreciates a functional coffee maker that focuses on the essentials. You’re paying for durability, consistency, and thoughtful touches like the programmable timer and detachable tank. Given that it has a long-standing manufacturing history dating back to 2007 and still holds up against contemporary offerings, that says a lot. While it's not exactly a steal, it offers strong value for its loyal coffee crowd.

1mid0ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mid0ht/fn_the_memory_receipt/,[FN] The Memory Receipt,"# The Memory Receipt

I noticed it when cleaning out my wallet—a receipt from a coffee shop I'd never visited, dated tomorrow. The barista's name was written in delicate cursive at the bottom: ""Served by Elaine."" Beneath that, a handwritten note: ""You'll want to remember this one.""

I nearly threw it away. But something about the paper felt important—the texture too substantial, the ink too deeply embedded. It smelled faintly of cinnamon and old books, unlike the chemical tang of thermal paper. I smoothed it between my fingers, studying the address: 317 Sycamore Lane. I knew that street well; it ran perpendicular to my daily commute, lined with brick buildings that housed antique shops and a hardware store that had been there since my childhood. But I couldn't recall any café.

That night, I dreamed of coffee grounds and ticking clocks.

When tomorrow arrived—a Tuesday that felt oddly significant—I found myself taking a detour. My feet seemed to know the way before my mind did, carrying me down Sycamore Lane until I stood outside a narrow storefront wedged between a bookbinder's shop and a locksmith. The hand-painted sign read ""Retrospect Café"" in faded gold letters. I would have sworn it had never been there before, though it occupied a corner I'd passed hundreds of times. The windows were fogged with steam, making it impossible to see inside, but warm light spilled onto the sidewalk.

A bell chimed softly as I pushed open the heavy wooden door. The interior was smaller than it should have been, given the building's façade. Five mismatched tables with wrought iron chairs occupied the space, only one of them taken by an elderly man reading a newspaper dated 1974. The walls were lined with shelves holding not books, but small labeled boxes, reminiscent of a card catalog system.

Behind a curved counter stood an elderly woman with silver hair twisted into an elegant knot. Her nametag read ""Elaine,"" and she smiled as if she'd been expecting me.

""First visit?"" she asked, though her eyes—a startling shade of amber—suggested otherwise.

I nodded, suddenly unable to explain the receipt in my pocket. The café smelled of freshly ground coffee, yes, but underneath that was something less definable—like rain-soaked earth and birthday candles just after they've been blown out.

""What can I get you?"" Elaine asked, her hands already moving toward a particular jar of beans, as if my order was a foregone conclusion.

""Just a black coffee,"" I said, though I usually took mine with cream and sugar.

She nodded approvingly and set about preparing it, her movements precise and unhurried. While she worked, I studied the café more carefully. The boxes on the shelves were labeled with dates and brief descriptions: ""Summer Picnic, 1962,"" ""First Snowfall, November 1987,"" and ""Morning Tide, April 2030."" The last one made me blink.

When Elaine handed me the cup, our fingers brushed, and the world tilted sideways. Suddenly, I remembered a summer from my childhood that never happened—learning to swim in a lake behind my grandmother's house. The water cooled against my skin as I floated on my back for the first time, staring up at a canopy of pine trees. The pride in her voice when I swam my first full lap. The sandwiches she'd made afterward, with crusts removed, just as I liked them.

But my grandmother had lived in an apartment on the seventeenth floor of a high-rise in Chicago. There had never been a lake. She had been afraid of water. I had learned to swim in chlorinated pools at summer camp.

""What is this?"" I whispered, the false memory feeling more substantial than the I had no receipt in my pocket, although I had real ones.

""Some people collect photographs,"" Elaine said, wiping the counter with a cloth that seemed to shimmer slightly in the café's warm light. ""I collect moments that got misplaced. Drink up before it gets cold.""

My hands trembled as I lifted the cup. The coffee tasted of pine needles and August sunshine, of the peanut butter sandwiches my grandmother had never made, of laughter that had never echoed across water.

""I don't understand,"" I said when I'd drained the cup. ""That never happened.""

""Didn't it?"" Elaine's eyes crinkled at the corners. ""Just because something didn't occur doesn't mean it isn't true. Some memories belong to lives we might have lived, if just one moment had gone differently.""

She took back my empty cup, her fingers brushing mine again. This time, I felt her slipping something into my palm—a small key, tarnished with age.

""Box 317,"" she said. ""When you're ready. Some people visit only once. Others become regulars.""

I clutched the key, its edges digging into my skin. ""Will I remember how to find this place again?""

Elaine's smile held a universe of gentle secrets. ""That depends entirely on what you choose to forget.""

When I left, there was no receipt in my pocket, though I checked twice. And when I glanced back from the end of the street, the space between the bookbinder and the locksmith had narrowed to an impossible sliver of brick wall.

But the key remained, warm in my palm, and somewhere in my mind, water lapped gently against a lakeshore that had never existed, while my grandmother—who had died afraid of swimming—called my name from the dock, her voice bright with a pride I'd never known.",1,1754409390.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Dodgers vs. Cardinals: A Tale of Two St. Louises (and Why Glasnow’s Fastball is the Real Star)""**

**Parse the Odds**:  
The Los Angeles Dodgers (65-47) are baseball’s version of a Netflix original series—everyone’s watching, and they’re *thisclose* to a playoff binge. The St. Louis Cardinals (56-57), meanwhile, are like a streaming service that forgot to cancel a subscription: still paying $15/month for fourth place. On the mound, the Dodgers deploy Tyler Glasnow, a pitcher whose fastball velocity makes a cheetah’s sprint look like a toddler’s crawl. Last season, Glasnow struck out 12 batters per game—imagine the Cardinals’ offense, which ranks 24th in runs scored, trying to solve him. It’s like asking a goldfish to solve a Rubik’s Cube.

Sonny Gray, the Cardinals’ starter, has the ERA of a man who once bet his paycheck on a slot machine. His 5.12 ERA this season suggests he’s more “slow-cooker” than “pressure cooker”—effective over time, but not exactly a game-breaker. Historically, the Dodgers have owned the Cardinals in August, winning 62% of August matchups since 2020. Why? Maybe it’s the LA sunshine melting St. Louis’ resolve like a $2.50 ice cream cone at a Dodger Stadium hot dog stand.

**Digest the News**:  
Recent Cardinals headlines read like a sitcom: “Player Trips Over Own Feet, Injures Hope,” or “Manager Mike Shildt Told to ‘Stop Overthinking’ by a Fan in a Batting Cage.” Seriously, their offense is so anemic that their best hitter, Paul Goldschmidt, has been compared to a dimmer switch—occasionally flickering to life but mostly just casting a sad glow. Meanwhile, the Dodgers’ offense is like a fully stocked buffet at a family reunion: abundant, chaotic, and guaranteed to leave you full. Their lineup boasts 11 players with 15+ home runs, including Freddie Freeman, who’s hitting so well he’s made “souvenir” look like a dirty word.

**Humorous Spin**:  
The Cardinals’ best chance? Praying Glasnow has a night where his control resembles a toddler on a tricycle—unpredictable, but at least it’s entertaining. Alas, Glasnow’s been as steady as a Swiss watch this season, with a 3.14 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio that makes a math teacher blush (3.8:1). As for the Dodgers’ defense, it’s so sharp it could cut through the Cardinals’ offense like a hot knife through a St. Louis-style toasted ravioli (which, let’s be real, is a thing of beauty. Respect.).

**Prediction**:  
The Dodgers win this series like a Netflix password shared by three households—dominantly and with zero regard for the Cardinals’ feelings. Glasnow’s heat will leave Sonny Gray grasping for shade, and the Cards’ bats will go silent faster than a Bud Light ad during a beer commercial. Final score? Probably something like 5-2. Bet on the Dodgers unless you’re a masochist who enjoys rooting for a team that’s, uh, “building for the future.” As the Cardinals’ players trudge off the field, they’ll be asking themselves, “Did we *really* need three-run homers from our backup catcher?” The answer: No. The Dodgers don’t even need their backup catcher to score three runs. They just need coffee.

**Final Verdict**: Dodgers in three. The Cardinals can take solace in their 1926 World Series title. It’s still valid. Probably.

I am in possession of two side tables and coffee table that belonged to my parents, but don’t know what to do with them. I’ve tried to sell periodically over the years, but I’ve never gotten a bite. I imagine that the tiles, although gorgeous and perfect for the original era, are so specific to the time and hard to integrate into many decors. I’ve even gone low in the price. Right now they are stored in my home and not listed anywhere. 

There is a coffee table just like this but without shelf on Etsy for $1000, but that seems very steep based on the lack of interest for mine when I had it listed for less. 

My question is this: What can non-professionals do with items like these that just don’t get much interest? I want them to be enjoyed for what they are. Do I send images to resale shops? I know I need to assemble them and take better photos with a less busy background, but other than that? ",2,1754409052.0,Mid_Century,0,1.0,False

I already have a fulltime job. I currently sell advertising space on a shared postcard mailer to local businesses and then mail them out to the community in high income areas.

Depending on how many homes you select to mail to (printing costs / mailing cost) determines how much you make.  Keeping prices low gets people to buy in.  You could even barter for an ad space if needed.  i.e. I will give you a free space to let me have a bounce house for my kids birthday.

You determine the price and income - your in charge.  Its a 9x12 direct mail postcard on thick 14pt glossy paper.

Selling all my spaces (18 spaces) = $8,000  
\-8 2x3 spots ($275) - \[$0.05 per house\]  
\-8 4x3 spots ($500) - \[$0.10 per house\]  
\-2 4x6 spots ($900) - ($0.18 per house\]

\-Stamps are not even that cheap!  Solo mailers are way more expensive with contracts! Your different!!

Printing 5,750 Mailers costs me = $1,593.00  
Mailing Costs (5,548 homes) = $1,238.54

Leaves me with a profit of $5,168.46 (Actual numbers from last run)

I place the extras out in car shops, coffee shops, library or use for future marketing material when showing example. I can give more information if needed.

Since I am not allowed to share links its hard to explain but the US Postal Service has a Every Door Direct Mail URL you can go to.  Select the town and route you wish to mail to (Select close to 5,000 homes as you can.  Avoid apartments, as Roofers, HVAC, Electricians wont find any benefit in advertising with you if you are mailing to that demographic)

You create a DBA (Doing Business As) with your city hall \~ $20  
You create a bank account  
You get account with Stripe  
You get an account with Canva

You then reach out to roofers, HVAC techs, Etc. in the town you are targeting or ones that service those towns.

Email them (use a free tracker google extension) You can see who has opened the email, follow up with another email a few days later to those and possibly a phone call.

Basically, this:

Subject:  ""RE:  <YOUR TOWN NAME> Question""  
Body:  ""Hate to bother you, my name is <YOUR NAME> and I am a local business owner myself \[You now have a DBA so its true!\].  I am putting together a postcard featuring local businesses in the area of <TOWN NAME> that will be targeting <#####> of homes.  It's a small fee to join and there are no contracts and no competitors allowed, so you would be the only <industry> on the card.  Would that be something you would be interested in?""

\-If they respond yes, interested, then send pricing and more information.  Make a sales packet (2 pages max) showing benefit of sizes what can fit, where your mailing (Mail routes) and average income etc. or neighborhood names.

\-Create urgency - Im in the process of reaching out to others in your industry - to lock in your spot, I can send you an invoice.  it's first come first serve.

\-If they say no, its okay let them go its not for everyone and they will respect you more down the line and possibly do business once they see it  
\-If they so no due to cost, Your in charge of pricing - can you take a $200 hit on an ad?  You determine that! Make that sale! Do what you need to - get your first card out so people see it!  
\-If they ignore you and the tracker shows they have opened it several times or your follow up email from no response earlier, people get busy and they forget - then call them or visit them - show them the benefit and make the sale but try to do as much remotely in your free time.  Schedule the emails in advance. etc.

\-If they say yes, get payment first.  Do not consider it closed till they pay.  Gather logo, colors, what they want it to say and any offers they want to put in there.  have them review it and approve it (you used canva so should be quick)

Thats the huge overview tons more but due to external links and stuff its hard to share completely.  Good luck guys!",1,1754408678.0,MakeMoney,0,1.0,False

1micp6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1micp6l/a_personal_essay_for_someone_who_is_searching/,A personal essay for someone who is searching,"Wanted to share my story in case it helps someone else understand their tangle of neurology. 

I’ve had sleep hallucinations regularly since my teens in the ‘00s, and occasionally sleep paralysis and sleep walking. Every once in a while, I would google sleep hallucinations, and all that was associated with it was narcolepsy. I thought, “Well I certainly don’t have that,” and never really looked into it. Of course if it said brain tumor I would have gone to the doctor asap. My only knowledge of narcolepsy came from AP Psych, where the teacher played YouTube videos of dogs falling asleep mid-run, and that seemed ridiculous. I felt tired and sleepy, often struggled to focus, sometimes fell asleep in class, and was very forgetful. Everyone said I was “just being a teenager” at best, lazy and dumb at worst. At 15, I started drinking 20 oz of coffee a day and smoking cigarettes. I was a very high-level fencer, but I would experience what I now believe is cataplexy during competitions. In the direct elimination part of the tournament, I would just get so worked up and stressed. My body would just shut down. My head and shoulders would droop, and I would go from extremely explosive power to just flopped. Just thought I needed to train harder. I always lost my DEs, and despite being in a teen group that would largely go fence D1 — a few even went to world cups — I just floundered as the equivalent of a gold belt. So I quit. 

By my late teens I started to develop some coping mechanisms to get better grades. What worked for others absolutely did not work for me. Starting sitting at the front of the class. Made it to college, and for all intents and purposes, ended up on a pretty successful career path. Coffee was non-negotiable. Cigarettes became a shameful habit that I kept returning to no matter how hard I tried. The cigarettes made no sense from a personality standpoint; I always considered myself an athlete, and not one of my friends smoked — in fact it was quite looked down upon in most circles I ran in. I just kind of hid it from people. At my office job, when I was in a period of quitting, I would use empty conference rooms to ""just rest my eyes"". I was on a decorating committee, and I pushed for a wellness room for nursing mothers. I absolutely wanted it to exist for that reason, but also, secretly, for me to nap in when no one needed it. (Not many new moms at that workplace.) 

I had a lot of tools to stay focused. I had gotten back into fencing, and when I was 29, I was fencing at tournaments purely for fun -- really just to hang out and graciously come in last. But, my coach noticed that the weird head drooping thing was more of an “episode” than a lack of training, since I was plenty fit. He thought I was holding my breath, and a lack of oxygen was causing a shutdown. I don’t think it was that in hindsight, but focusing on breathing absolutely helped it pass, probably as a form of emotional regulation. I just focused on buying time until I was back to normal. And you know what? That realization made me start to place, and even occasionally win, some local tournaments. It didn’t stop happening, but I could work around it at least. If the fencing experience was cataplexy, it’s a very atypical presentation. I’ve had somewhat similar experiences at CrossFit if we are doing complex moves. It’s like, my body just freezes. What was an easy (if mentally challenging) rep just two seconds ago, I can’t even pick up the bar now. Then I do the deep breathing, wait a minute, and I’m back in action. It’s very different from fatigue, where it comes on gradually, my form starts to weaken, and it’s very clear that something is too heavy. (Needless to say, I’m very careful at CrossFit. I won’t do things that don’t have an easy way to bail, like the rope climb.) I’ve also had more classic presentations. I was doing makeup and thinking about a really, really difficult conversation I was going to have, and suddenly my knees just felt like jello, and I had to sit until it passed, I just couldn’t stand. Once I was walking my dog and was very upset about something, and I couldn’t physically carry her (she is 7 lbs, and this is me, the Crossfitter). 

My coping mechanisms, in hindsight, were also pretty extreme. They didn’t usually come up in conversation, so I guess I never realized. One example: in the morning I put out a clean bowl of water for the dog. I had to get a new bowl, fill it, bring it to the spot, and then take the old bowl to the kitchen. If I just took the old bowl to the kitchen I’d probably forget what I was doing and the dog would have no water for potentially a long time. At some point several years ago, I started rehearsing for any important call, meeting, or doctor's appointment. I mean I spent literally hours just practicing what I was going to say before seeing a new doctor about a concerning condition. I just never knew when the fog would overtake me, and if it was hammered into my brain, I could at least ride on muscle memory to say what needed to be said. I screened for ADHD, anxiety, and OCD but it was never quite that. I didn’t have the worry spiral. I \*could\* change the sequence of things, but I would just forget whatever it is I was supposed to be doing.  If I had something on a Saturday near my house at 9 am, and it required me to be “cognitively on”, I would get up at 6 or 6:30 just to have a full 2.5-3 hours to “wake up” fully. It was a pain to ensure adequate caffeination while traveling because it’s annoying to constantly stop for coffee. 

Everything changed after my mom got really sick. She had a transplant at a facility that does them outpatient. So instead of an army of nurses proving round-the clock care, she went into a clinic for 2-4 hours a day, and it was me in a near constant panic the rest of the 24 hours. I alternated weeks with one sister while trying to work from home at the same time. It changed everything. My sleep was absolutely out of control. What was once a scary but brief hallucination of, say, a snake going up a wall, became a crazy multi-sensory experience. I had a couple of situations where I saw, heard, and even felt the hallucination before it disintegrated before my eyes, and it became really hard to accept that they were not real. I would sleep walk sometimes 5 times a night. Just up, down, up, down. Waking up even more than usual. But not like a half-awake-roll-over, I mean like I could do algebra. I could meet an important dignitary. I could give a sales presentation-level of wakefulness. So that sent me to the doctor. I had been seeing a therapist throughout caregiving, and I saw a psychologist as well. Both ruled out PTSD, and I was referred to a sleep specialist. Luckily I could pick in the referral, and knowing that the hallucinations were associated with narcolepsy, I went to great pains to make sure I could see someone with that experience and not just sleep apnea. 

None of my coping mechanisms worked anymore. I had quit nicotine, and knew if I went back, I’d probably never be able to quit again. I just constantly felt like I was physically underwater — everything moved slowly, sounds were muffled, colors were muted, and I’d be fighting with my life to stay in the present moment. Started napping multiple times a day, sometimes with dreams. I was so bad at my job, thank god it was the slow season. I would just forget to ask follow up questions, my explanations of things were weak. It often felt like ""the darkness was overcoming me"" and I just needed to lay down. 

I think one of the worst parts in all of this was people not understanding or believing me. A lot of people would say things like, “Oh I get tired too,” “Caffeine can be very addicting,” “I also get sleepy,” ""You have such a peppy personality, it can't be that bad,"" etc (I do have a peppy personality when I'm not lost in the fog.) I mean yeah, no shit. We all go to sleep once a day and have hard jobs. I realize now that my tired was just not the same tired as everyone else. I started focusing on describing the underwater feeling, or the sensation of the darkness closing in on me. That got more of an, ""Oh yeah, that's not ok"" response. 

It took a long time to get the PSG and MSLT scheduled, and then I got COVID, so I had to push it back even further. Took a long time to see her for follow-up too. In the end, I was borderline. My PSG had 7 hours of sleep but 138 arousals (they like to see 10 or less per hour, I had 19). My MSLT sleep latency was 10 on average, and I slept for all 5 naps. No REM, though I swear I started to dream on one before nearby construction started. Sigh. My last nap was 8 minutes, which my provider said was the most noteworthy. You’d think after 7 hours of sleep the night before, and 4 naps, I would not be as tired, but that was the fastest latency. I never sleep well in new beds, it could have been that. My provider would like me to retest one day, but I just don’t know — the caffeine taper was a hell I never want to experience again. She is willing to treat me though, since I have all other T1N symptoms, including cataplexy.  

She said we could start with sleep or wakefulness drugs, but not both at the same time. I’m not sure if that’s standard practice or just because my MSLT was unclear. I picked sleep since it was well-documented. Ramped up on gabapentin at night, and was supposed to keep going, but I just hit a breaking point, so we switched gears. I kept 600 mg of gabapentin at night, and added 100 mg of modafinil a day. Modafinil has been life-changing. Like, truly life changing. I know not everyone is so lucky that the first wakefulness drug, let alone the first dose, works so well, so I’m very grateful. It’s like the fog has cleared. I don’t feel underwater anymore. Colors seem brighter. I needed to send something from another doc to the sleep doc. I went to the first patient portal, then needed to get the password from my phone, and then go back to the patient portal and entered it. I’m not kidding, I cried a little bit when I did that — two devices and I did not once forget what I was doing. Then I was able to download the thing, do a couple of things, and upload it to the second portal. All without losing my place!! More happy tears. And it’s kind of been that way. I still get physically, mentally, and emotionally tired, just not sleepy, foggy, or underwater. I think it’s the same tired that everyone else experiences. I go to CrossFit in the morning, and now I'm tired after, but it’s not “the darkness is closing in on me, I absolutely must lay down for 20 minutes before work” like it was before. I’m better at it, too. I’m not getting that freeze on complex moves. I was able to do quite a lot of box jumps the other day, and honestly I think it was not for strength but because my attention could stay on the balance and mechanics. Sometimes I physically could not jump rope if I was feeling foggy (I just didn't have the focus), but now I can no problem. I’m sleeping a lot better, too, paradoxically. I think actually using my brain again is making my body go into deeper sleep. I also wake up a few minutes before my alarm, which I don’t think has been a regular thing for me since maybe middle school. I also feel like I can do a cognitive thing an hour after waking up, and it’s not a big deal. 

There are a few things it doesn’t do. It has no effect on my motivation. I keep watching the Adam Sandler travel agent skit from SLN. “We can take you on a hike, but we cannot turn you into a person who likes hiking” = “Modafinil can make you focus for 8 hours, but it will not make you like focusing for 8 hours.” I’m still trying to build up my mental stamina as well. I still can’t quite do a full workday at full focus without burning out by the end of it, but every day it gets better. It’s done so much, but it’s not magic. It takes (as the skit says) incremental lifestyle changes sustained over time. But I feel, finally, confident I will get there. I also still have some forgetfulness. I won’t lose my place in a sequence of things like I did before, but I still forget where I put my phone 30 minutes ago -- things like that. 

At first I had no appetite, but that’s come back. I also started to experience some anxiety about a week in. I think what helps my brain manage multiple tabs, metaphorically speaking, means my brain is globbing onto whatever negative thought percolates up and running with it, rather than just glossing over. Realizing that was a big key, and now I’m able to stop some of those thought cycles. The other thing that’s taking some getting used to is that it’s harder to relax. Before, I could just close my eyes and it was “Brain Off”. It took so much effort to keep the lights on that relaxing was just an immediate power down. Now it’s kind of the opposite. If I lay down to rest, it’s like a radio that won’t turn off. I can change the station, but not the volume. So I’m kind of having to learn “how to relax” for the first time. I was like, ah, I get the Calm app now — some people must have loud brains and need an app to be calm. But if I could hack it before, I'm sure I can develop some new techniques now. 

In the end, it’s still not a clear-cut picture. It kind of feels like a very defined Before and After with the caregiving. Sometimes I question how bad it was before caregiving, though that could be (ironically) the modafinil anxiety talking. I don’t think I had the language to describe my tiredness back then, since I assumed everyone else felt the same tired as me. I wasn’t trying to convince anyone back then; if anything, I was probably carrying a chip of “lazy and dumb” and doing my best to prove that wrong. So I kind of only have fencing and habits to look back on for comparison. Many are falling away as I no longer need them to get by. It’s been kind of weird. I’m grateful to have the time and brain space back, but also in the midst of so much change, it’s an element of “who am I.” Also, holy cow, a day is so long when it’s full of thoughts the whole time. Sometimes I wake up at night, but not as alert as before. I occasionally get hallucinations. Those could go away in time or possibly some medication adjsutments, all of which I will discuss with my provider at the next appointment.  

In addition to the sleep and wake issues, I also started to get migraines every 7-14 days during caregiving, whereas before caregiving I got maybe a handful per year at most (except for one stint in college when I got them a lot). I still haven’t figured that piece out, but I’m hoping as my system regulates, they will become less frequent. Hopefully getting the hang of relaxing will help too. It’s still kind of a mystery. I don’t think I officially have the T1N label, though I’m wondering at my next follow up if it will be warranted given the modafinil response. Part of me wonders if I had an orexin-related die off sometime in my early teens, and the sheer trauma of caregiving caused another one to happen that I can no longer fight through on my own.

I hope my lived experience helps someone else, whether it's getting a better understanding of what some of these things are like, or simply borrowing the language. I don't feel like the narcolepsy page on Mayo Clinic really describes my lived experience, or what other people have described on here. Reddit, Facebook groups, most blogs, etc did not exist in my teens, neither for myself nor my parents. But better late than never. I hope I can pay the knowledge forward to the next person.

This machine came packed with intriguing features that seemed to promise both a quality brew and ultimate convenience, but as with every product, there’s a fair mix of awesome and not-so-awesome. Let me break it down for you.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker instantly caught my eye with its sleek copper finish. It’s not just pretty but blends well in both modern and traditional kitchen settings. The weight of the machine is just right—not so heavy that moving it becomes a chore, but substantial enough to feel durable. The dimensions (11.46""D x 7.87""W x 14.29""H) mean it fits nicely on most countertops without hogging all the space. If I had to nitpick, the buttons felt slightly less premium than the rest of the device, but they are laid out smartly, making operation straightforward.

**Functionality and Features**  
What honestly sealed the deal for me was the range of brewing options. The machine offers two brew styles—Classic and Rich. I tested both with different coffee blends and noticed the flavor profiles were distinctly different, with the ""Rich"" option coming through as bold and full-bodied without being overpowering. The timer and delayed brew settings got a good workout in my house; being able to set it the night before meant I no longer had to stumble towards the coffee maker in a pre-caffeinated haze each morning. 

**Find the best price for Ninja DCM201CP on Amazon.** 

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
Brewing performance is where this machine really shines. The ""Hotter Brewing Technology"" ensures even saturation and ideal temperature control, making every cup taste just right—no bitterness in sight. I also appreciated the mid-brew pause. It’s a lifesaver when you're too impatient to wait for an entire pot. The 14-cup glass carafe is fantastic for get-togethers, but even when I was brewing a smaller batch (1–4 cups), the machine calibrated well to keep it from tasting diluted.

**Convenience and Usability**  
Filling the 70-ounce removable reservoir is remarkably easy—I carried it over to the sink without spilling a drop. The freshness timer gave me a light chuckle initially (because who’s counting minutes since their last caffeine hit?), but it turned out to be a surprisingly handy feature when entertaining guests. The warming plate, with its three heat settings, kept the coffee piping hot for hours during our last family brunch. One less thing to fuss about!

**Advantages**  
- The ability to choose between Classic and Rich brewing styles for tailored flavors.  
- Convenient removable water reservoir makes refilling user-friendly.  
- Variable warming plate allows coffee to stay hot for up to four hours.  
- Smartly designed with programmable features like delay brew and freshness timer.  
- Robust construction with an aesthetically pleasing copper finish.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The buttons lack a premium feel, which might irritate users expecting a high-end experience.  
- The machine can be slightly noisy during operation—not a dealbreaker but noticeable in a quieter setting.  

**Competing Products**  
There’s no shortage of drip coffee makers in the market, but the Ninja DCM201CP holds its own fairly well. Compared to the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, which also boasts a 14-cup carafe, the Ninja edges out with its more flavorful Rich brewing feature. The Cuisinart, however, offers some bragging rights with its stronger build quality in the buttons and more temperature control settings. Another rival would be the Breville BDC450 Precision Brewer, a pricier option with multiple brewing modes targeting coffee connoisseurs. Yet, for its price range, the Ninja holds steady with its array of functional, everyday features, and its ease-of-use trumps Breville’s somewhat overwhelming interface.

**Smart Spending**  
The price point of the Ninja DCM201CP feels appropriate given the wide feature set and quality. It’s not ridiculously expensive yet offers more than your regular drip coffee maker. If you're someone who likes a balance of rich flavors, convenience, and brewing flexibility, it delivers well for what you’d be spending. The machine is especially worthwhile for households that churn out several cups a day or those who entertain often. If I could tweak one thing, it’d be slightly making it quieter, which would elevate it to near-perfection.

I'm only using natural ingredients, so, FO's are out of the equation. In the past I've used cold brew for coffee soaps, but, as we all know, that doesn't leave any lingering smell. I was wondering if instant coffee would be a better way to go, since it's essentially just concentrated coffee powder. Maybe it would be stronger? In the same breath, I really want a Chai soap and was wondering if anyone had experience there or if I'm stuck buying all of the essential oils needed for Chai... which would be cost prohibitive. Any thoughts on boiling these down into syrup? 
Any direction is much appreciated! :)",2,1754408534.0,soapmaking,1,1.0,False

1micneb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1micneb/feeling_a_sense_of_anxiety_and_stagnation_after/,Feeling a sense of anxiety and stagnation after we hired eight people from overseas over the course of 3 months and went from busy all the time to being bored.,"For the longest time it was just my manager, me (senior sysadmin) a part time endpoint manager admin, and a part-time help desk guy. My manager and I were doing everything else IT related. Servers, networking, security, projects, compliance, hardware refreshes, managing countless platforms, tools, and applications. It was overwhelming and terrible and frankly I'm not sure why I stayed because this went on for years. 

However, about 5 months ago we finally got approval to hire much needed help and over 3 months, we hired a bunch of specialists who took the lion's share of the work off of my plate. We hired a project manager, 2 project engineers, Network administrator, security specialist, O365 specialist, server specialist, and a SOC analyst.

At first it was a sigh of relief. That first week was pure bliss. For the first time since I started I was able to take a coffee break and actually enjoy it instead of trying to focus on not dreading the gigantic overdue to-do list that was waiting for me back at my desk. However now I find myself in an interesting bind. I haven't done any kind of integration or project since they all started and I've even started helping out our help desk guy with tickets because there's literally nothing else to do. I've already updated all my documentation, taken inventory, cleaned out the server room, Little things like that that fall by the wayside when you're busy. 

I want to stay useful (read: employed) as well as fresh which is becoming increasingly hard to do because anything new or big coming our way is automatically handed off to a specialist (My manager had asked me to stand up our Jamf tenant and create documentation which I was actually looking forward to doing before he ganked the project out of my hand and gave it to one of the project engineers) while I sit here and twiddle my thumbs hearing about all of the great stuff they are doing during our weekly stand-up meetings. I just got a 20% raise two weeks ago so it seems like my manager doesn't have any plans to cut me out anytime soon but should I bother approaching my manager about my concerns?",3,1754408520.0,sysadmin,1,1.0,False

1miclle,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1miclle/how_does_the_cuisinart_12cup_coffeemaker_enhance/,How Does the Cuisinart 12-Cup Coffeemaker Enhance Your Morning Routine?,"As a coffee lover who considers mornings impossible to tackle without a hot cup of joe, getting my hands on the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG was exciting. Coffee makers are a daily staple in my household, so testing this programmable drip coffee machine felt like an opportunity to enhance those buzzing mornings. Packed with smart features like a 24-hour programmable function and an ergonomic glass carafe, this product seemed like it could be an upgrade from my previous machine. However, practicality often speaks louder than first impressions, so I put it to the test.

**Design and Aesthetics**  

I was pleasantly surprised when I unboxed the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG. Its sleek, modern design in black with a curved finish didn’t feel out of place on my kitchen counter. Measuring 7.75"" by 10.5"" by 14.5"", it fits well even in smaller spaces, and the carafe has an ergonomic handle, making it comfortable to pour. Buttons on the interface are intuitive and spaced out—no fumbling early in the morning for controls. That said, while the black finish looks clean and premium, it is slightly prone to fingerprints if you’re meticulous about keeping your space spotless.

**Performance and Brewing Functionality**  

This drip coffee maker delivers on its promise of freshly brewed coffee. The 12-cup capacity is enough to fuel a family breakfast or to keep my caffeine cravings in check throughout the day. The 24-hour programmable feature has been a real time-saver. I love that every morning before my alarm even goes off, my coffee is already brewed and waiting, steaming-hot, on the warming plate.

The warm-keeping feature, which functions for two hours, is convenient when I stretch that first cup across the morning. Plus, I can set the automatic shut-off to prevent leaving the machine on, which is a nice energy-saving touch. Brewing a single cup mid-cycle with the Brew Pause feature works perfectly for when I can’t wait, although I noticed a slight spillage if the carafe isn’t replaced quickly—a minor hiccup in an otherwise smooth flow.

**Good Points**  

- Large 12-cup capacity perfect for families or avid coffee drinkers.  
- Programmable brewing saves time and ensures hot coffee is ready when needed.  
- Brew Pause function adds convenience for those in a hurry.  

**Areas of Concern**  

- The black finish, while visually appealing, requires frequent wiping to maintain its sleek look.  
- Brew Pause feature can cause slight drips if the carafe isn’t replaced swiftly.  

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1500TG price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0947bfpdx/)  

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  

Cleaning is one aspect of kitchen appliances that can’t be ignored, and this machine does decently in that department. It comes with a permanent nylon coffee filter, which eliminates the need for paper filters, and the charcoal water filter gave the coffee a noticeably fresher taste by reducing impurities. The machine even includes a built-in clean (descaling) function that lights up with an LED alert when it’s time to descale. Regular descaling was straightforward with little hassle, though the carafe’s narrow mouth made manual cleaning with a sponge slightly tricky.

**Competing Products**  

When stacking the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG against other popular coffee makers like the Hamilton Beach BrewStation or the BLACK+DECKER 12-cup Programmable Coffee Maker, a few points stood out. The BrewStation, for instance, offers a brew-to-dispense function that eliminates the need for a carafe altogether, reducing potential spills. On the other hand, the BLACK+DECKER machine provides a similar larger capacity and programmable features at a slightly lower price point, but it doesn’t quite match the ergonomic design of the Cuisinart’s carafe or its built-in cleaning capabilities.

What impressed me most about this product is its attention to small daily conveniences like the 24-hour preset, adjustable keep-warm, and easy-to-use controls. It may not be unique in the crowded field of coffee makers, but it certainly holds its ground well.

**Coffee Taste and Temperature**  

The real test of a coffee maker, however, is the coffee itself. This one delivers consistently hot coffee at an ideal drinking temperature, without that burnt taste that plagues some machines. As someone who’s picky about flavor, I noticed the coffee brewed tasted clean and fresh, likely thanks to the charcoal water filter. Granted, my tastebuds might demand premium beans for a gourmet experience, but this drip machine highlights their flavors beautifully.

**Affordable Quality**  

Though the price fluctuates across retailers, I’d say the features and build here justify the spend. The energy-saving options and programmable design enhance its value compared to basic models. Sure, there are alternatives at a fraction of the cost, but long-term durability (backed by Cuisinart’s three-year warranty) and the functionality offered make this a smart investment for frequent coffee drinkers.

Went home on day 6, living 2 hrs from the hospital was hard in the hard collar, every speed bump/pot hole hurt.  Im at day 30, walking is still a challenge, sleep still can be hard, i can shower/bathroom solo since day 6-7.  improving has been as slow as i was told.  pt starts next week, and driving again!

some things that helped, a back scratcher, but break the hand piece off (wood), and duct tape a metal spoon to it.  wont get in the stitches.  milkshakes, apple sauce, yogurt (i hate it) ice water....with a bendy plastic straw and very LARGE cup, like a Yeti.  Take snacks, and instant starbucks coffee it helps in the hospital.  a wedge pillow in bed, and got a old nintendo that helped pass the time.

be nice to nurses, they got the hookup in the hospital, plus you might make a cool friend too, one picked up a pizza for me to split.  good times had.

here's the downside the docs dont speak of it much!   ive always been positive, upbeat and lots of energy.  ive never once been depressed or suicidal. the combo of drugs, surgery..the depression and it hits hard.  it becomes a mental battle early.

1micikf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1micikf/why_choose_the_hava_tdjr09_countertop_dishwasher/,Why Choose the HAVA TDJR09 Countertop Dishwasher for Small Spaces?,"My experience with the HAVA TDJR09 countertop dishwasher has been nothing short of a mixed bag of convenience, efficiency, and a few areas to ponder. As someone who loves to cook but dreads the post-meal dishwashing chore, this appliance promised to be a game-changer. Testing this portable dishwasher over weeks has given me plenty of insights about its capabilities, quirks, and where it excels or falters.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**

The compact design of this countertop dishwasher was one of the first things I appreciated. Its dimensions (16.86 x 16.75 x 18.05 inches) make it perfect for a small kitchen, dorm room, or even an RV. I placed it on my counter, and it fit snugly without stealing too much space. The glossy white finish and integrated handle gave it a modern appearance, blending seamlessly with my kitchen decor. Its freestanding design didn’t require plumbing, thanks to the built-in 5-liter water tank, which felt like a lifesaver for temporary setups or spaces without dedicated connections. Setting it up took me less than 10 minutes, and I was up and running without breaking a sweat.

**Ease of Use**

Operating the dishwasher was a breeze; the touch controls were intuitive, and the LED display provided a user-friendly interface. With eight wash programs, such as Economy, Intensive, Normal, Heated Dry, and Rapid, there seemed to be a setting for every occasion. For a dinner party with grease-laden plates, the Intensive mode worked wonders, while for a quick rinse, the Rapid mode was spot-on. The added child lock was a thoughtful feature, especially for households with curious little ones. Another convenience was the delayed start function, which could be adjusted up to 18 hours. I often loaded the machine at night and set it to start early morning, so the dishes were ready with my morning coffee.

[Check HAVA TDJR09 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0dms6821r/)

**Cleaning Performance**

When it came to cleaning power, the dishwasher held its ground for most loads. Its redesigned dish rack accommodated various utensils, bowls, and plates effortlessly, while the rotating arm ensured a thorough 360-degree wash. Even delicate glassware came out spotless and scratch-free most of the time. The integrated water softener played its part in tackling hard water stains, a common challenge in my area. After testing multiple wash cycles, I noticed that the ECO mode was an excellent choice for lighter loads, conserving water and energy without sacrificing results. However, the drying performance was average; some plastic items came out with droplets, requiring me to manually pat them dry.

**Enhanced Energy Efficiency**

One of the standout features here is the energy-efficient design. With optimized ECO modes and an energy consumption rate of 950 kilowatts annually, it struck a balance between performance and eco-consciousness. I appreciated how this dishwasher delivered decent results while keeping my electricity bill in check. It felt like a small step toward practicing a sustainable lifestyle—something that resonates with me as an environmentally conscious person.

**Pluses**

- Portable with no plumbing needed  
- Efficiently tackles hard water stains with the built-in water softener  
- User-friendly controls and multiple wash programs  
- Space-saving design, ideal for tight kitchens, dorms, or RVs  

**Limitations**

- The noise level, at 60 dB, might be noticeable in smaller apartments  
- Plastics often required manual drying  

**Competing Products**

Compared to similar portable countertop dishwashers like the Farberware FDW05ASBWHA or the BLACK+DECKER BCD6W, the HAVA TDJR09 gives them a run for their money. While its 5-liter built-in water tank offers a hassle-free installation advantage, the Farberware model stands neck-to-neck with its lower noise level. On the other hand, the BLACK+DECKER dishwasher provides slightly wider interior capacity but lacks the water softener feature crucial for areas with hard water. It’s safe to say that each model has its merits depending on individual needs.

**Value Assessment**

Despite its limitations, the HAVA TDJR09 manages to justify its price through its blend of portability, efficiency, and smart design, offering both convenience and decent cleaning power for its cost. It doesn't over-deliver but fulfills its promise for anyone with space restrictions.

People update their social media announcing how they’ve got funding for their projects, articles published, dream jobs achieved et c.

That way I learned that it’s ok if your application is rejected, or if your lecture turned out pretty bad. It doesn’t make *you* a failure. It happens to everyone, no matter if you’re a phd student, or a very experienced professor, or anything in between.

So. Let me hear about your latest failures! In what ways have **you** sucked this last week?

I’ll start! I’m a postdoc, and right now I’m really struggling with an article that I need to hand in in a month. The structure is horrible, the introduction makes no sense and I think I’m actually contradicting myself twice (it’s hard to tell, because it’s so badly written). I ran into the head of my department over the coffee break, and told him that this text is such a mess right now. When he asked what it was about I managed to lose my train of thought. About my own work. Twice. In like 90 seconds. So yeah, my brain is mush and the HoD probably regrets hiring me. But hey, onwards and upwards!",5,1754407767.0,academia,3,0.78,False
1micbhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1micbhe/how_do_we_love_our_neighbor/,How do we love our neighbor?,"In the parable of the Good Samaritan, there is an important note to highlight. Samaritans and Jews were not simply people who disagreed on a few issues. They weren’t people who would be civil to each other if they must, but wouldn’t go out of their way to hang out. They HATED each other.

We don’t know anything of note about the traveler. It’s assumed that he was a Jew but that’s never outright stated. We don’t know his history, his family, his employment, his income, if he was gay, if he was some other minority, if he wasn’t even one of the dominant religions of the time.

What we do know is that the Samaritan was the least likely to help based on everything that was commonly believed about them at the time. A priest walked right on by not wanting to get his clothes dirty. A Levite walked right on by.

I made a post yesterday, well a couple but I’m mainly referring to one specific one. I wonder today how I can love my neighbor more and better. Jesus asked who was being a good neighbor to the man, and they answered, obviously the one who stopped to help. But is it obvious? Sometimes it’s the least obvious person you’d ever think of.

I can sure be a better neighbor to people, namely conservative Christians. I have no problem being a good neighbor to immigrant minorities, or other trans people, or discriminated groups. I resonate with that and it comes naturally to me. But could I be the same good neighbor to someone who just voted to take my rights away? To someone exactly like the mob of people who had me resorting to literally flee my state in April?

The Samaritan man didn’t put any conditions on his aid. He didn’t say convert to my religion first, or even accept me first. He didn’t say get your people to stop being mean to mine and I will help you. That conversation may have taken place after, but it isn’t listed anywhere in any text and it didn’t happen before. He just picked him up and took him to an inn and even paid his own money for the man to stay there. He told the inn keeper if he took good care of this man that he would pay extra when he returns. And maybe the traveler was a bad man who hated Samaritans too, and maybe the Samaritan helping him when no one else would, maybe that was what started to change his views, and make himself more hospitable towards Samaritans.

NOTHING is known about this traveler, and I’m learning why. It’s because nothing was relevant. The only thing we know for sure about him is the only thing that matters, which is that he was in severe need. He was vulnerable, in danger and needed help. That’s all we know.

Who is your traveler? And who is your Samaritan? Maybe you’re a progressive Christian like me, and your neighbor is a maga person. Or maybe you’re a maga person, and your neighbor is a trans woman like me. Would you help them? Maybe harder than that, would you ACCEPT help FROM them?

I heard a preacher a long time ago say “God don’t always show up looking like God”. Sometimes God crosses into your path as a homeless man, or a prostitute, or a gay man or a trans woman. Or a woman who had a recent abortion, or a miscarriage. Or a divorcee. God doesn’t always cross your street looking holy and divine. God is trying to interact with you, but you’re missing it, you’re missing HIM every single time because you’re too uncomfortable or too good to talk to a trans woman, or a trump voter, or a woman who had an abortion. The parable of the treasure in the field comes to mind also.

What’s important about the Samaritan story is the same thing I takeaway from Jesus saving the adulterous woman. The text tells us he stooped down and wrote something in the dirt. People have theorized to the ends of the earth about exactly what he wrote, because there are zero hints to it anywhere. But then, if it were really that important, wouldn’t we know? Wouldn’t God himself had told us? Maybe the specifics of what he wrote aren’t what’s important, but the fact that he bent down. He met the woman where she was. And he didn’t put any conditions on him saving her life that day.

I wonder how many of us, and I am talking to myself here as much as any of you, how many of us only help people we feel deserve it, or people we agree with, or people on our own side? If I saw a homeless person would I give them money? Would I still if they were wearing a Trump shirt? Would I accept help from them? Would they from me? Would it speak at all to them that someone like me, someone whose rights they just voted to take away helped them?

I don’t know. But there’s theorizing and then there’s doing. There’s asking questions in curiosity, and then putting things to action. The priests wife at my episcopal church had her phone stolen out of church on Sunday during the coffee hour. I was leaving, and she ran outside and described the person and asked if I’d seen them. She said her phone was in her purse. I told her I hadn’t seen anything, and she just took off walking. I didn’t really think, I just knew she probably shouldn’t be walking around Denver without a phone or any way to contact anyone, so I jumped out and followed her and went with her. Didn’t even think to turn my car off first. Fortunately we’d gone back by there a few minutes later and I turned it off and we continued on.

My conviction lies in the question of would I have done the same thing if she was someone else? If it was a different church? If she didn’t vote like she did? I’d like to think I would have. We all like to think we would do the right thing. But when situations present themselves it can be entirely different. No one really knows how they will react. And my conviction lies in the fact that I can’t answer that question as fast and as definitively as I’d like.

We ended up tracking her phone through the find my app on her Apple Watch, and tracked it to a parking structure about a quarter mile away. We spent an hour walking around, playing the sound, listening inside trash cans, periodically rechecking the app to make sure she hadn’t left. There was a college across the street, we went and looked around trash cans and mailboxes over there as well, nothing. Then I started walking around the outside of the parking structure.

A few minutes later I’m coming around and see my friend (priests wife who had her purse stolen) dead sprinting across the street back towards the college. The bottom of my eyes catch an orange purse sitting on the ground right in front of the door. Her purse. Everything was there, including the rosary her mom and dad had both died with. Something that you can’t just buy another one. She was in tears, and thanked me for helping her. I told her I didn’t feel I did that much. I just walked with her. She said that was enough and took me for pizza.

I was a neighbor to her, as she and her husband were to me when I first moved to Denver. I only found out later her husband took this job and they moved here just a few months before I did.

But it was easy to be a good neighbor to her. She was my friend. The priests wife of the church, or one of the churches who helped save my life. Can I be a good neighbor, equally as good of a neighbor to someone who “doesn’t deserve it”. Is that even my decision to make? Humanly, we want to have our pride. But that’s not Jesus. This is my conviction today after my post yesterday.

I don’t know where we go from here. Truly I don’t. I don’t know how this all gets better. I do know all this polarization and us versus them isn’t what God wants for us. I do know God is the only one who can save us. And I do know that where we can start is by being better neighbors to each other. Both helping and accepting help from people we never imagined we would. Not being too good to do either. Bending down in the dirt like Jesus did, picking up the beaten up traveler like the Samaritan did.

We know nothing about the traveler, because it’s not supposed to matter. So maybe it shouldn’t. And maybe it shouldn’t in our current day with our current people either. I think we can all love people a little bit better. I certainly know I could stand to.

I will strive to be a better neighbor. My tanks are running on empty, but I have one olive branch left, and this is me holding out. I truly don’t want all this fighting and polarization. And while I can’t do anything about the nation or the White House, I can about my online community, and my local community. I can be a better person and a better neighbor to the people in my circle. Not just the ones I think deserve it. The way you do that? Bend down like Jesus did, meet them where they are, empathize and try to understand.

1mica26,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerHardwareHive/comments/1mica26/explore_the_best_usb_desktop_speakers_creative/,Explore the Best USB Desktop Speakers Creative Pebble V2 Worth It,"The Creative CT-PEBBLEV2-BK has been part of my daily desktop setup for a few weeks now, and I must admit, it delivers a surprising punch for its size. These compact desktop speakers are marketed for minimalists, and they genuinely live up to that claim. Small enough to fit unobtrusively on any surface, they blend seamlessly with my workspace, adding a touch of style without dominating the space. Testing them with various tasks like work calls, casual music listening, and even light gaming has been a treat, but there are a few notable nuances one should know about.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and modern design of this desktop speaker system. Finished in a matte black, with an understated yet stylish form, the speakers easily suit various setups – from minimalist home offices to vibrant gaming battlestations. They aren’t just pretty looks, though; the front-facing volume knob is within easy reach, and the longer cable connecting the left and right satellite speakers ensures no tugging or awkward stretching on my desk. The compact size is both a blessing and a limitation, as it doesn’t take up valuable desk space but might leave audiophiles craving more punch in the bass department.  

**Latest USB-C Connectivity and AUX-In**  
Incorporating USB-C connectivity is a brilliant move. It’s an element I’ve come to expect in newer gadgets, and it means these speakers are somewhat future-proof. Pairing them with a USB-C port on my laptop allowed me to experience improved audio quality, especially at higher volumes without noticeable distortion. For those with older systems, they thoughtfully include a USB-C to USB-A converter, so no one is left out of the fun. While setting up was easy (plug in the AUX for audio and USB-C for power), I found managing multiple wires could feel slightly cluttered at times – no wireless option here.  

[Check Creative CT-PEBBLEV2-BK price on Amazon.](https://pcotter.com/p/b07vvp8bgd/)

**Built-In Gain Switch for Amplified Audio**  
Testing the speakers with both a 10W USB-C and USB-A port revealed how the built-in gain switch amplifies audio output effectively. These little guys can pump out up to 8W RMS of total power and even peak at 16W. Though they lack a dedicated subwoofer, their performance at these power levels is genuinely impressive. When switched to high-gain mode, the difference in volume and clarity is evident, making them far superior to standard laptop speakers. However, anyone seeking thunderous bass might want to look elsewhere, as these are meant for clear mids and trebles in a small package.  

**Richer Audio Quality with 2-Inch Drivers**  
The dual 2-inch custom-tuned far-field drivers combined with rear-facing passive radiators deliver an enjoyable audio experience, especially if you’re within close proximity. Playing some bass-heavy tracks, I noticed a solid attempt at replicating richer tones, though it doesn’t compete with larger, subwoofer-equipped setups. The clarity of the mids and highs, however, is a definite strength, whether I was listening to podcasts or taking Zoom calls. Audiophiles might pick on the lack of depth, but for the average user, this level of performance will be more than satisfying.  

**45-Degree Elevated Drivers**  
This design element is not just a gimmick. The drivers’ 45-degree elevation angles sound directly toward you for a more focused audio projection. Whether I was seated in my chair typing away or leaning back with a cup of coffee, the audio remained directed and precise. It’s one of those small innovations that add significant value to the listening experience without being overly complicated.  

**Pluses**  
- Compact and visually appealing design suitable for any setup.  
- Future-proof USB-C power for clearer, louder performance without distortion.  
- Built-in high-gain audio switch enhances output when paired with higher-power ports.  
- Rich mid and high tones, excellent for daily multimedia needs.  

**Drawbacks**  
- No wireless connectivity, so cable clutter might annoy some users.  
- Limited low-end bass compared to larger systems or subwoofer-inclusive setups.  
- Works best in closer proximity, reducing its usability in larger rooms.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to alternatives like the Logitech Z207 or Bose Companion 2 Series III, the Creative model shines in its sleek design and forward-thinking additions like USB-C support. Logitech’s Z207 offers Bluetooth connectivity, which is a convenience this product lacks; however, the audio clarity at higher volumes on the Creative Pebble V2 surpasses the Z207. Bose, famous for sound quality, delivers deeper low-end performance, but their bulkier footprint tends to clash with minimalist setups. In terms of overall value, Creative’s minimalism and intelligent design win for users seeking simplicity and style.  

**Budget-Friendly**  
The price-to-quality ratio of these small desktop speakers is undeniably appealing. It fills a gap for folks who want excellent sound on a budget, without the unnecessary frills that tend to hike up prices. I’ve tested pricier alternatives, and while this product doesn’t offer premium bass, its clarity and focused audio output more than make up for it. For students, freelancers, or casual listeners who don’t wish to break the bank but still want quality, these speakers hit the sweet spot.

Packed with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and lignans, flax seeds offer a multitude of health benefits, including improved heart health, digestive function, and hormonal balance. Buying flax seed in bulk is an economical and practical choice for health-conscious individuals, bakeries, food manufacturers, and those who regularly incorporate this superfood into their diet.

[[Explore Top Rated bulk flax seed on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=bulk flax seed)

## Key Features Analysis

When evaluating bulk flax seed, several key features should be considered to ensure you choose a product that aligns with your needs and preferences. These features encompass aspects like seed type, origin, processing methods, and packaging to preserve freshness. A careful assessment of these features will empower you to make an informed purchase.

**Seed Type: Brown vs. Golden Flax Seed**

Brown and golden flax seeds are the two most common varieties available. Brown flax seeds have a slightly nuttier and more intense flavor compared to golden flax seeds, which have a milder, butterier taste.Nutritionally, both varieties are largely similar, offering comparable levels of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and lignans. The choice between brown and golden flax seed often comes down to personal taste preference and intended submission. golden flax seeds are sometimes preferred in lighter-colored baked goods where the darker color of brown flax seeds may be less desirable.

**Origin and Sourcing practices**

the origin of flax seed can influence its quality and sustainability. Flax seed grown in regions with optimal climate conditions and enduring farming practices tends to be of higher quality. Look for flax seed that is sourced from reputable suppliers who prioritize ethical and environmentally responsible farming methods. Traceability and transparency in the supply chain are also important indicators of quality and integrity. Some suppliers may offer information about the specific farms or regions where their flax seed is grown.**Processing Methods: Whole, Ground, and Flaxseed oil**

Flax seed is available in various forms, including whole seeds, ground flaxseed, and flaxseed oil.Whole flax seeds have a hard outer shell that prevents the body from fully absorbing their nutrients. Grinding the seeds breaks down the shell, making the nutrients more accessible. Ground flaxseed is more perishable than whole seeds and should be stored properly to prevent rancidity. Flaxseed oil is a concentrated source of omega-3 fatty acids and can be a convenient alternative for those who don't want to consume the whole or ground seeds. However, oil lacks the fiber and lignans found in the whole seed.**Packaging for Freshness and Storage**

Proper packaging is crucial for maintaining the freshness and quality of bulk flax seed. Look for packaging that is airtight, opaque, and resealable to protect the seeds from exposure to air, light, and moisture. Vacuum-sealed packaging is notably effective at preserving freshness. Consider the size of the packaging and choose a quantity that you can reasonably use within a reasonable timeframe to minimize the risk of spoilage. always store bulk flax seed in a cool, dark, and dry place to prolong its shelf life. Once opened, ground flaxseed should ideally be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to prevent rancidity.

**Organic Certification**

Organic certification ensures that the flax seed is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides,herbicides,or fertilizers. This is an important consideration for consumers who prioritize organic and sustainable food choices. Look for flax seed that is certified organic by a reputable certifying body, such as the USDA or the European Union. Organic flax seed may be slightly more expensive, but it offers added peace of mind for those concerned about chemical residues in their food.

**Purity and Cleanliness**

The purity and cleanliness of bulk flax seed is another important aspect to consider. Look for flax seed that has been thoroughly cleaned and screened to remove any foreign materials, such as stones, stems, or weed seeds. Some suppliers may provide information about their cleaning and quality control processes. High-quality flax seed should be visually uniform in size and color and free from any signs of damage or contamination.

## Core benefits

Consuming bulk flax seed offers a wide range of health benefits. Its unique nutrient profile, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and lignans, contributes to overall well-being. Integrating flax seed into your diet can have a positive impact on your heart health,digestive function,and hormonal balance.

**Improved Heart Health:** The omega-3 fatty acids in flax seed, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. ALA helps to lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and prevent the formation of blood clots. Studies have demonstrated that regular consumption of flax seed can significantly decrease LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels and increase HDL (""good"") cholesterol levels, contributing to a healthier cardiovascular system.**Enhanced Digestive function:** Flax seed is an excellent source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, which are both essential for maintaining healthy digestive function. Soluble fiber helps to regulate blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and promotes regular bowel movements. Consuming flax seed can help to prevent constipation, improve gut health, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.**Hormonal Balance:** Flax seed contains lignans, which are plant compounds that have antioxidant and estrogen-like properties. lignans can definitely help to balance hormone levels in both men and women. In women, lignans may help to reduce symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats. In men, lignans can help to protect against prostate cancer.

**Reduced Inflammation:** The omega-3 fatty acids in flax seed have potent anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation is a major contributing factor to many chronic diseases, including heart disease, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. Consuming flax seed can help to reduce inflammation throughout the body, lowering the risk of these conditions.

**Improved Skin and Hair Health:** The omega-3 fatty acids in flax seed are also beneficial for skin and hair health. These fatty acids help to keep the skin hydrated, reduce inflammation, and protect against sun damage. Consuming flax seed can help to improve skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and promote healthy hair growth.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions about bulk flax seed before making a purchase. It's essential to address some of the most common concerns to facilitate informed decision-making. This section covers frequently asked questions about storage, planning, and nutritional value.

**How should I store bulk flax seed to maintain its freshness?**
To preserve the freshness of bulk flax seed, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark, and dry place. Whole flax seeds are more stable and can be stored at room temperature for up to a year. Ground flaxseed is more perishable due to the exposed oils and should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to prevent rancidity. Properly stored ground flaxseed can last for several months in the refrigerator or up to a year in the freezer.

**What is the best way to consume flax seed to maximize its nutritional benefits?**
To maximize the nutritional benefits of flax seed, it is indeed best to consume it in ground form. Grinding the seeds breaks down the hard outer shell, making the nutrients more accessible for digestion and absorption.You can grind whole flax seeds at home using a coffee grinder or purchase pre-ground flaxseed. Add ground flaxseed to smoothies, yogurt, oatmeal, baked goods, or salads.

**Is there a recommended daily dosage for flax seed?**
A general suggestion is to consume 1-2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed per day. It is indeed critically important to start with a smaller amount and gradually increase your intake to avoid any digestive discomfort. Drinking plenty of water is also essential when consuming flax seed to help prevent constipation.

**Can flax seed interact with any medications?**
Flax seed can interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners and diabetes medications. If you are taking any medications, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider before adding flax seed to your diet. Flax seed can also lower blood pressure, so individuals with low blood pressure should monitor their blood pressure carefully when consuming flax seed.

I wanted to yell, to tell him how many nights I cried wishing he’d come back. Instead, I just nodded and said, “It’s okay.” But it’s not okay.

# Best Coffee Cup Sleeves 2025: Top Brands Compared

Coffee cup sleeves, frequently enough underestimated, play a crucial role in enhancing the overall coffee-drinking experience. They provide insulation, protecting hands from excessive heat or cold, and offer a pleasant grip. Beyond functionality,sleeves often serve as a canvas for branding and environmental messaging. As single-use coffee cups continue to be a part of our daily routines,the quality and sustainability of coffee cup sleeves are becoming increasingly critically important to consumers and businesses alike. This article explores some of the best coffee cup sleeves available in 2025, comparing their features, benefits, and suitability for different users.

[[Explore Top Rated coffee cup sleeves on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=coffee cup sleeves)

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee cup sleeves offer a combination of insulation, durability, grip, and environmental consideration. let's examine some of the key features that distinguish top brands in 2025.

**Insulation Performance:** A sleeve's primary function is to insulate the hand from the temperature of the cup's contents.

Good insulation performance is crucial for preventing burns from hot beverages and maintaining the desired temperature of cold drinks. Different materials offer varying degrees of insulation. For example, corrugated cardboard provides excellent insulation by trapping air between its layers, while thicker felt or foam sleeves offer a more substantial thermal barrier. The effectiveness of the insulation can be measured by the temperature change experienced on the outside of the sleeve over a given period, with high-performing sleeves exhibiting minimal temperature variations.

**Grip and Stability:** A secure grip is essential for preventing spills and ensuring a comfortable holding experience.

The texture and design of the sleeve considerably impact its grip. Sleeves with textured surfaces, such as embossed patterns or non-slip coatings, provide a better hold compared to smooth surfaces. The fit of the sleeve around the cup is also vital; a snug fit prevents the sleeve from slipping or rotating, further enhancing stability.Some sleeves incorporate features like interlocking tabs or adhesive strips to ensure a secure attachment to the cup, minimizing the risk of accidents.

**Material Sustainability:** With increasing environmental awareness, the materials used in coffee cup sleeves are under scrutiny.

Sustainable options are gaining popularity as consumers and businesses seek to reduce their ecological footprint. Recycled cardboard, compostable paper, and plant-based materials like bagasse (sugarcane fiber) are increasingly common alternatives to traditional paper or foam sleeves. the environmental impact of a sleeve is evaluated based on factors such as the percentage of recycled content, compostability certifications, and the sourcing practices of the raw materials. Brands committed to sustainability often provide clear information about their environmental initiatives and certifications.

**Customization Options:** For businesses, coffee cup sleeves offer a valuable branding chance.

The ability to customize sleeves with logos, slogans, and designs allows companies to reinforce their brand identity and create a memorable customer experience. Customization options range from simple printed logos to full-color designs and embossed patterns. The quality of the printing and the durability of the design are essential considerations, ensuring that the branding remains intact throughout the life of the sleeve. Some manufacturers offer eco-friendly printing options using soy-based inks and sustainable printing processes.

**Durability and Reusability:** While many sleeves are designed for single-use, some are engineered for repeated use.

Durable sleeves made from materials like silicone or thick felt can withstand multiple uses, reducing waste and offering a more economical option for frequent coffee drinkers. These reusable sleeves are often designed to be easily cleaned and maintained, ensuring hygiene and longevity. The durability of a sleeve is assessed based on its resistance to tearing, folding, and degradation over time.Sleeves designed for reusability often feature reinforced seams and sturdy construction to withstand the rigors of daily use.

1mic2e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mic2e1/explore_the_best_french_door_refrigerator_ge/,Explore the Best French Door Refrigerator GE GFE28GYNFS Worth It,"Using the GE GFE28GYNFS refrigerator in my home over the past few months has been quite the experience. Its modern design, spacious interiors, and innovative features stood out right from the start. This French Door refrigerator is the focal point of my kitchen, blending a sleek, fingerprint-resistant stainless steel exterior with practicality. I have kids who love to run their sticky hands all over things, so having an exterior that doesn’t constantly look smudged is a massive win.  

There’s a lot to unpack here, and though I’m mostly satisfied, there are some quirks worth mentioning. Whether it’s about how it performs during hectic family weeks or its energy-saving attributes, I’ve given this appliance a thorough workout. If you’re considering it, here’s the lowdown.

**Storage Capacity Made For Busy Households**  
This fridge has a total capacity of 27.8 cubic feet, which is spacious enough for my family of four. Grocery shopping in bulk is standard for us, and I could comfortably fit everything in—produce, milk gallons, leftovers, you name it. The adjustable shelving system provides flexibility; one weekend, I even stored an entire party cake without awkward Tetris-style rearranging.  
The freezer drawer is a compartment I especially love for its organization. With two levels, it’s easy to separate frozen veggies from tubs of ice cream. Gone are the days of digging through frozen items to find that singular bag of peas lurking in the abyss.

**Performance That Doesn’t Disappoint**  
What really stood out to me is its Turbo Cool and Turbo Freeze settings. Hosting a family BBQ meant constantly opening and closing the fridge, and these settings ensured everything stayed chilled when needed. This is especially important during summer when drinks and produce need consistent cooling. Oh, and I have to mention that this fridge maintains a surprisingly uniform temperature in every corner. Even in those hard-to-reach spots at the back, I didn’t discover wilted greens or half-frozen bottles of juice.  

[Check GE GFE28GYNFS price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b09tbpjz4c/)  

**Exceptional Water Filtration System**  
The Advanced Water Filtration system is another aspect that impressed me. The taste of the water it dispenses is clean and fresh, making my ancient faucet filter obsolete. Plus, the integrated ice maker keeps a steady supply of ice for my endless iced coffee habit, although sometimes it can’t keep up during social gatherings. A small inconvenience, but it's something to keep in mind if you entertain frequently.  

**Impressive Upsides**  
- Spacious 27.8 cu. ft. capacity, perfect for families or party planners.  
- Advanced Water Filtration system ensures fresh, clean drinking water.  
- Turbo Cool and Turbo Freeze settings maintain consistent temperature, even with frequent usage.  
- Fingerprint-resistant stainless steel exterior is ideal for busy households.  

**Some Drawbacks I Came Across**  
While the fridge performs like a champ most days, there are a few things that could be better.  

- The ice maker sometimes struggles to meet demand; it works fine for daily needs but can fall short for parties.  
- The beeping alert when a door is left open could be louder. If you’re a bit farther from the kitchen, you might miss it.  
- The price makes it a significant investment, and while worth it, it isn’t exactly “budget-friendly.""  

**Competing Brands Are Worth Considering Too**  
Compared to a similarly sized Samsung or LG French Door refrigerator, this one holds its own. LG models have a slight edge with their InstaView feature—knocking on the glass to illuminate the interior without opening the door is undeniably cool. Samsung fridges, on the other hand, often come with tech-forward features like integrated smart screens that sync with your devices. Despite these conveniences, I found that GE excels where it counts—performance and reliability. The temperature consistency alone makes this model easily outperform competitors in real-world usability, even if it doesn’t have as many flashy bells and whistles.  

**Quality for Price**  
For what it offers, the GE GFE28GYNFS French Door refrigerator is an investment. Its storage convenience, energy efficiency, and practical design contributed to why I feel it was worth purchasing. However, the price definitely leans on the steeper side. If you’re someone who prioritizes consistent performance and durability over additional gadgets, this refrigerator fits the bill. That said, if cutting-edge technology or luxurious extras matter more to you, exploring other options might make sense.

My most recent therapist seemed amazing at first. He helped me a lot by diagnosing me with autism, which has essentially changed my life. However, a few things happened over the last year that have made me question if he is the right fit for me. 

First of all, all he wants to talk about is movies. Movies are a special interest of mine, so I appreciated it at first. But now he changes the subject constantly to movies, and gives me ""homework"" of movies to watch. He says he doesn't have enough time to watch every movie he wants to see, so he has me watch one, and then tell him if it's worth it. Sometimes I will be trying to talk about my life, and he will ask me what movies I've seen recently. 

He also yawns a lot during our sessions. He always says he hasn't had enough coffee - but it's every single session he's yawning. 

Lastly, a few weeks ago, he asked a lot of really personal questions about my sex life with my husband, and how often I touched myself, and what I thought about when I did it. At first, I thought it was normal and relevant - but now I feel really uncomfortable about the fact I answered those questions. 

All of this has lead me to cancel my sessions, and stop attending therapy. I plan to eventually find another therapist, but at the moment I'm just kind of weirding out.

1mibzie,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1mibzie/the_emergency_alert_system_played_a_message_just/,The Emergency Alert System Played a Message Just for Me,"I clocked in a few minutes before midnight. Same as always. I swiped my badge, watched the light turn green, and walked into the half-lit lobby, where the vending machines buzzed louder than the lights. I set my thermos down, tapped the monitor to wake it up, and started another shift guarding a building that never saw traffic. 

Technically, I work security for a research facility on the edge of the industrial district. What kind of research? I couldn’t tell you. They don’t brief night guards. My job is simple: walk the halls every hour, check the doors, monitor the cameras, and call it in if anyone tries to sneak onto the property.

No one ever does.

Honestly, I think the whole place is a shell company. There are labs and conference rooms, sure, but I’ve never seen more than three or four people in the building during the daytime turnover. The lights stay off in half the offices. Most of the server racks hum just to keep themselves busy. Once in a while, I’ll see a crate in the loading bay marked “hazard,” but it’s always empty by the time my shift starts.

The boredom is what gets to most guys. Not me. I don’t mind the lack of action. There’s a comfort in routines that never change.

I keep a radio on at the desk. One of those weather-alert units that doubles as an emergency broadcast receiver. Wired to receive work notifications that never came. Only the occasional emergency alert would pop through, never important to me, but something to break up the monotony of the shift. Usually, it just loops weather updates or dead air. Tonight, it hummed softly, tuned low enough to ignore but loud enough to notice if something serious happened. 

Outside, the wind pushed against the security glass. I sipped lukewarm coffee and flipped through the incident report log, already knowing it would be empty. The camera feeds showed still hallways. A broom leaning against a janitor’s closet. A copy room no one used. The red light above the exit sign blinked at its usual pace.

I sat back, let the chair creak under me, and settled in for another shift watching nothing happen.

I’m good at being invisible. I don’t ask questions. I don’t get in the way. I do the job, fill out the forms, and keep my head down. Most people forget I’m even here.

The shift had settled into that quiet dead zone between 2 and 3 a.m., where time stretches and the brain starts to drift. I was halfway through a stale protein bar and watching the cursor blink on a blank incident report when the emergency radio crackled to life.

Three sharp tones. The standard ones. I didn’t react at first. The Emergency Alert System runs regular tests once or twice a week. Always the same canned message. Usually about weather conditions or missing children three states over. I kept chewing, waiting for the usual script.

“This is a test of the Emergency Alert System.”

My ears perked up at the authority of the voice. 

“This message is for...”

There was a pause.

“... Richard James Sommerfeld.” 

My full name.

Not just the one I use for work. The full thing. The one from my birth certificate. Middle name included.

“Please remain indoors and do not engage with the noise outside your perception. Estimated test duration: one hour.”

The message ended there. No explanation. No origin. The radio cut back to low static.

I sat up, the protein bar still in my hand, half-chewed. I fiddled with the radio, expecting it to play the last message again. Nothing. No timestamp logged. No saved segment.

I tried to convince myself it was a prank broadcast. Some local station playing games. A coincidence. Maybe someone hacked the system and fed in a custom message to mess with people.

That didn’t explain the name. It didn’t explain why the warning felt so specific. It started out by saying it was a test, maybe it was some new system they’re piloting, one that pulls names from local databases to make it feel personalized. A mistake, maybe.

I sat back down, suddenly aware of how quiet the building had become. The only sound was the wind brushing against the high windows, and the low, steady static humming through the emergency radio.

\-

I spent the next few minutes trying to shake off the message. I kept telling myself it was nothing, just some rogue test broadcast.

Still, I couldn’t stop glancing at the radio. It hadn’t made a sound since. Just the soft hiss of static, steady and quiet. I thought about unplugging it, but I kept it on, in case something important came through. 

I made another round through the halls. Everything looked exactly the way it always did. Dead screens, humming fluorescents, the distant echo of my own footsteps. When I came back to the desk, I checked the log, tapped through the camera feeds, and started filling out some paperwork just to keep my hands busy.

That’s when the tones started again.

Three quick pulses, followed by the same voice,  

“This message is for Richard James Sommerfeld. You were eleven years old when you refused to visit your mother in the hospital.”

My fingers stopped moving.

“You told your brother it didn’t matter, that she wouldn’t remember. You said it to hurt him.”

I stared at the radio, unable to breathe for a second.

“You were wrong.”

There was a pause. No static this time. Just silence stretching for two beats longer than it should have.

“You will attempt to check the loading dock in thirty-five seconds. Please reconsider.”

The radio clicked off.

I didn’t move at first. Just sat there, heart knocking against my ribs, hands cold.

I hadn’t spoken about that fight in years. Maybe ever. The words it used weren’t quoted, but they were accurate enough to know. Whoever, or whatever was speaking, understood the shape of it. Knew the guilt that still curled up behind my teeth.

Part of me thought this had to be a setup. Maybe someone trying to make me believe the broadcast was intelligent, alive. Could be a deep data scrape. Old emails. Recordings. An elaborate hoax.

But another part of me was already walking toward the back hall.

I didn’t plan it. My body moved on its own. I scanned my badge at the service door and followed the concrete corridor past the janitor’s closet and the old vending machine. The dock was at the far end.

I reached the metal door and pulled it open.

The dock outside was empty. No trucks. No footprints. Just wind moving through the chain-link fence.

Still, I stood there too long. Longer than I needed to. Waiting for something else to happen.

\-

By the time the third message came through, I was more irritated than rattled. Whatever was going on, I figured someone had too much time and access to things they shouldn’t. It didn’t help that nothing else had happened. No follow-ups. No intruders. No evidence anyone was watching me, even though something clearly was.

I kept running mental checklists. It could have been a test. A psychological experiment. Maybe someone at the company had wired in a new kind of behavioral monitoring. But if that were true, why start dragging my personal life into it?

Still, I wasn’t scared. Not really. Just tired and annoyed, and ready to finish my shift and go home.

I was walking the northeast corridor when it started again.

No tone this time. No buildup.

“Do not turn around.”

I stopped. Mid-stride. I didn’t breathe. Something in my spine locked.

The hallway behind me had no lights. I hadn’t noticed it before; I could only tell by the darkness in my peripheral vision, but it was completely dark. Not dim. Just gone.

I waited. Five seconds. Ten. My body refused to relax.

Then, against better judgment, I started to turn.

Slow at first. Just a glance over the shoulder.

That was enough.

The far wall to my left rippled. My vision warped around the edges, colors bleeding into one another, angles stretching wrong. My left eye went cloudy. My right started to tunnel. And under it all, the sound began to rise.

Glass shattering. Nails on tile. Teeth clacking too fast to be human. Breathing from too many mouths at once. Screams that never opened their throats. The kind of noise that makes your insides want to curl away from your skin.

I stopped.

Didn’t finish the turn. Didn’t look into the dark.

Just stood there, half-pivoted, jaw clenched tight. Then I faced forward again.

It all stopped. Instantly.

The lights returned to normal. The sounds vanished. My vision cleared.

But when I turned to look down the hallway again, not behind me, but ahead, the corridor had changed. A rolling cabinet now blocked the path I was heading towards. A steel door had appeared where there was none before. Emergency lighting outlined a new path branching left, where there hadn’t been one ten minutes earlier.

I didn’t try to force the old path open. Instead, I stared at it, realizing something important.

Whatever this was, it didn’t want me to go back. It had rules, even if I didn’t understand them yet.

\-

I didn’t have a destination at first. I just wanted to find the front entrance again. Or any exit. Maybe the main stairwell, maybe the fire doors. Somewhere that didn’t feel like it had been rewritten behind my back.

But the building wasn’t the same anymore.

Corridors I had walked a hundred times were suddenly too long, or too short. Some ended in blank walls, leading me into doors that only led to mystery. Others turned corners that shouldn’t exist. I passed a mechanical room that I knew was supposed to be on the third floor, but I was still on the first. The elevator didn’t work, the cameras were frozen, and the maps on the wall were blank, scrubbed to white.

Still, I kept moving. My best chance now was memory. Using approximate landmarks, no matter how distorted, to try to discern where I really was. Trying to find an anchor point so I could navigate to a way out. But more often than not, I found myself just randomly navigating based on whatever options I had ahead of me.

That came with its own danger. If I followed a path that led to a dead end, I couldn’t just spin around and go back.

I’d learned that the hard way.

Once or twice, I flinched at a sound behind me- footsteps where there shouldn’t have been, a door slamming shut on the far end of a hall, and instinct took over. I’d start to turn. Always just a little. Always just enough to catch the start of something wrong. A ripple in the air. That shrieking, layered noise bleeding through again.

And always, I caught myself just in time.

It was becoming reflex. Forward only. No matter what I heard.

That was when the voice returned.

No warning tone. Just there, suddenly, woven into the air like it had always been speaking.

“Route correction in effect. Please proceed to the Observation Zone. Avoid interior mirrors.”

I stopped walking. The hallway ahead dipped slightly before curving to the right. I hadn’t been down this way in months. I was pretty sure it only led to storage, not any place labeled “Observation Zone.”

The voice didn’t speak again. Just the one line, delivered in that semi-human tone.

I kept going, choosing a side path instead. It should’ve led past the central IT server room and back toward the lobby. At least it used to.

Halfway down the corridor, I spotted a round security mirror mounted in the corner.

From where I stood, I could see myself in it, blurry but centered. That wasn’t what stopped me.

What stopped me was the blackness behind my reflection. Pitch black, like everything behind me had been cut out of the frame, even though I knew there were lights on.

I stepped closer. When I stood beneath it and looked up, the reflection was gone. The surface of the mirror was now just glass-dark. No light, no shape. Nothing reflected at all.

Every reflective surface I passed after that behaved the same way. At a glance, they showed my silhouette and blackness behind me. The moment I got close, they turned to dead glass.

I stopped checking them after a while.

At that point, I wasn’t just avoiding the path the broadcast wanted me to take, I was actively working around it, trying to stay ahead of whatever route it was building for me. I didn’t trust it. I didn’t trust any of this. But I couldn’t afford a mistake. If I wandered into a corridor with no other way out, and the walls behind me decided to erase the path I’d come through, I’d be stuck.

Or worse, I’d be forced to turn around.

And I was starting to believe something was waiting for me to do just that.

\-

I was moving faster now, not running, but close to it. My heart had settled into a low, steady beat just above normal. I kept my eyes forward, scanning for changes in the layout, watching the walls for fresh seams or strange signage. My flashlight flickered once, then came back strong. I tapped the battery gauge. Still full.

That was when the broadcast cut in again.

It didn’t wait for me to stop. No setup. The voice spoke as if it had been listening the whole time, which I now suspected it had.

“You are checking the battery level.”

My chest tightened. I stopped walking. It knew what I was doing.

Then it added one more line.

“Avoid the next intersection. You won’t listen. We are sorry.”

I stood in the center of a long, low corridor, the overhead lights buzzing above me in rhythm with my pulse. The radio shut off again. Nothing but the quiet hum of old fluorescent tubes.

The line echoed through my head as I moved again. Slower now. Eyes narrowing as the hall opened into a crossroad.

There, at the intersection, I heard it.

Not loudly. But it was there.

Sobbing. Faint. Choked and slow, like someone trying not to be heard. And underneath it, another sound, breathing, ragged, wet. Then a single, mechanical click.

I stopped at the threshold. One foot still in my hallway, the other just past the corner.

The crying sounded close.

I didn’t move for a while. I stood frozen, thinking about the voice, about the exact wording: You won’t listen.

So what did that mean? That I was already choosing? That I had already failed the test it mentioned?

I tried to trace my thoughts, to see where the decision had started. Was I truly choosing anything here? Or was I reacting, following a trail already laid down? If I went toward the crying, was that compassion, curiosity, or a script I was meant to follow? And if I didn’t, would that be real defiance, or another programmed branch?

The hallway around me remained empty. The floor beneath my feet stayed steady. But my head swam with the idea that no matter what I did, I was already inside someone else’s plan. That the system didn’t need to control me, only predict me.

I looked toward the direction of the crying.

Then I turned the other way and walked, fast and straight, until the sound disappeared behind me.

\-

The lights began cutting out one by one.

Not all at once. It started in the west corridor, then the breakroom, then the hallway just outside the server cages. A silent collapse of function, wing by wing. I heard it before I saw it, the soft flick of breakers flipping in sequence, leaving behind nothing but the hum of backup lighting and the sound of a low siren I’d never heard before. It wasn’t blaring, not urgent. It pulsed slowly, steadily, as if reminding something to stay awake.

Then every screen came to life.

Monitors I hadn’t touched in hours. Tablets still plugged in and locked. The emergency radio. All of them glowed in perfect sync, showing the same cold white text over black:

‘Subject deviation confirmed. Sequence collapse in 12 minutes. Manual override required. You are not authorized. Proceed.’

That was the first time it mentioned collapse.

The first time it told me, openly, that this whole thing was breaking down. Though I had no idea what that truly meant.

I didn’t stay in that hallway. I kept moving, heading for the central spine of the building, hoping that if I stayed in motion, I could find some edge to all of this. But the layout had changed again.

The ceilings dropped by almost a foot. The air vents had vanished. Hallways had grown tighter, sharp turns where smooth curves had been before. I passed a supply room that looked identical to one I’d seen earlier- same chairs, same desk, but the desk was on the left this time, and the wall clock ticked backward.

The floor creaked under my boots in a way it never had before. Soft, hollow. The weight of the building had shifted.

Behind me, the sound began again.

Clicking. But slower this time. Deeper. Metal tapping on tile. It echoed from far down the corridor, bouncing and multiplying until I couldn’t tell which direction it was coming from.

The air behind me pressed against my back. Not wind. Just pressure. Heavier than it should have been.

My footsteps started replaying themselves. I would take a step, then hear it again half a second later. Sometimes in sync. Sometimes not. I heard voices, too. Ones I didn’t recognize. They whispered things that didn’t match my memories, but they sounded familiar anyway.

I turned a corner. I stopped breathing. Didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

I didn’t turn. Not even a glance. But the edges of my vision began to twitch. Not black, but movement, flickering just beyond where my eyes could land. Shadows stretching without a source. A curl of something sliding along the ceiling tiles above me, never visible, always near.

The clicking had stopped.

It wasn’t following me anymore.

It was waiting.

I pushed forward.

I reached a door I didn’t recognize. Heavy steel, no markings. It opened with a creak into a small room. A halogen strip flickered from above. There was no furniture except for a metal table bolted to the floor. The room looked like it was used for experiments that were currently absent.

On the table sat a mounted radio unit and a single folder. The cover was gray, stamped in red with a warning that read: “Pattern Violation Manual - DO NOT ISSUE.”

I opened it.

Every page was blank.

Except one.

In the center, typed in plain black text:

IF IN DOUBT, TURN AROUND.

I closed the folder.

And I didn’t turn.

\-

The corridor was waiting for me. Despite all the directions I took, I ended up back.

Same length. Same lights. Same intersection. It hadn’t changed since the last time I had come to the crossroads.

Except this time, the crying started before I even got close.

It came from the far corridor. Low at first, wet and staggered, the sound of someone trying not to be heard but failing. A woman, maybe. Young. Or something trying to sound young. It echoed off the walls in slow pulses.

Then came the radio.

“Turn around. Comply. Reset. Turn around. Comply. Reset.”

Over and over again.

I stopped at the intersection. My eyes burned. My legs ached. I felt hollowed out, like every room I had passed through had scraped something away without asking.

I stood still, not because I was afraid, but because I was furious.

I said nothing out loud, but my mind screamed.

I’ve followed your rules. I’ve broken them. I’ve walked your paths. Avoided your traps. I’ve done everything but this.

What if this is it? What if this is the only move left? What if the test was never to obey, but to disobey at the right time?

I turned toward the corridor where the crying waited.

And stepped inside.

The temperature dropped instantly. My ears rang. The walls tightened around me. The deeper I walked, the louder everything became.

Screeching metal. Whispers that knew my name. Breathing behind my neck. Every noise layered on top of the next until there was no space between them.

My vision narrowed. Not completely black, but close to. The edges began to glitch, filled with static and flickers of color, as if the world behind me was being erased frame by frame.

Something moved inside the walls.

Shapes pressed through the drywall, outlines of people, but wrong. No features. Just stretched skin where eyes and mouths should have been. Arms folded the wrong way. Fingers too long. They clawed softly at the air, not reaching for me, just twitching in rhythm with the noise.

I didn’t blink.

I didn’t speak.

I kept walking.

My heart felt too big for my ribs. Every breath rattled. The floor dropped slightly beneath my feet, like the hallway was being pulled downward.

Then everything stopped.

One step, just one, crossed an invisible line.

And the world snapped silent.

The air warmed. My vision cleared. My ears rang in the absence of noise.

I stood in the main lobby of the building.

Fluorescent lights buzzed calmly overhead. The front windows were intact. I saw dawn breaking through the glass, faint orange light spilling across the floor.

Then a door behind the desk burst open.

Dozens of people in black tactical gear poured through, sweeping the room. Rifles drawn. Helmets down. No insignias. Just armored suits and mirrored visors.

Behind them came medical staff, scientists, techs with wheeled carts and blinking cases. They moved with urgency, but not panic. They knew this scene. They had trained for it.

I turned slowly, looking over my shoulder. Subconsciously grappling with the idea of being able to see behind me now. 

Where I had just emerged, stood static.

Not a wall, exactly. More like the edge of a dome. It shimmered faintly, air trembling with digital interference. I could see through it, but the colors were wrong. Shapes moved inside- soft, slow, echoing my memory of the corridor I had just walked.

As I stared, a hand closed around my arm.

Firm. Gloved. Real.

I turned. A soldier stood there, face hidden behind a matte black visor, already steering me away from the dome before I could speak.

I spun to face the soldier. The man wore a full tactical helmet, visor down, not a slit of skin peeking through.

“What is this?” I demanded. “What the hell happened? Who are you people?”

The soldier didn’t answer. He gripped my arm tighter and pulled me across the lobby, past rows of gear being unpacked, past medics shouting into headsets, past equipment I couldn’t identify. I caught glimpses of heat sensors, portable servers, hissing tanks with red seals broken open. Everything buzzed with urgency, none of it explained.

They had set up a temporary cordon using collapsible barriers and lighting rigs. Inside the makeshift zone, I saw others. Three, maybe four. All wore lab coats, scorched and torn, some stained with ash, some flecked with static-burn scoring. One woman sat hunched in the corner, cradling a cracked tablet to her chest as if it were a wounded animal.

The soldier shoved me inside and stepped back.

I didn’t move. Just stared.

One of the scientists looked up. A man in his fifties, pale, wide-eyed, his face hollow with exhaustion.

“You walked out?” he asked. His voice broke halfway through. “You got out on your own?”

His shock emphasized how big of a deal this was. But without context, I still had no idea how to feel about it.

“What happened in there? What’s going on?” I asked.

Finally, I got some answers.

“This facility has been running for a few decades. Whatever you think is cutting edge- looks like gears and sticks compared to what’s done here,”

Another scientist, a co-worker maybe, shot him a look to shut him up. It seemed he couldn’t reveal exactly what they were doing here.

He stood slowly and crossed the space between us. Lowered his voice to a hush, barely above a whisper.

“You were inside the test field,” he said. “That wasn’t real. It was a prototype construct. An artificial cognitive environment. A simulation meant to study recursive decision making and perceptual looping. It was never supposed to activate.”

He glanced toward the dome, still pulsing softly at the far end of the lobby. His eyes twitched.

“Something went wrong,” he continued. “It started responding to observation. Growing. Feeding on recursive feedback. The more we watched, the more it changed. We lost two teams trying to extract the workers.”

He paused, breathing heavier now.

“But you... You weren’t tagged. You weren’t supposed to be there. You walked into the active field by accident. And somehow... You made it through. Alone.”

Behind us, a klaxon burst to life. A different tone than before. Sharper. Faster.

A voice shouted from one of the workstations: “Field integrity dropping! Fifty percent and falling!”

I could see more teams running in, charging into the unknown.

The scientist grabbed my shoulder.

“If the containment fails,” he said, “it doesn’t stay in there. Each person running in will probably die. We just have to hope one manages to shut it down.”

I had nothing to say. All I could do was watch, with the extracted scientists, as these brave soldiers ran in to die like ants. Numbers versus odds. Legions of deaths happening beyond the veil. Until eventually, the static dome dissipated with a screech, and a lone soldier stumbled out, torn to almost ribbons. ",1,1754406979.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for a little over a year now, and things have been kind of perfect. We go on fun dates, we have deep convos, he makes me laugh all the time and I don't think we ever actually fought, at least nothing major. He’s the most thoughtful and attentive man I've been with, always checks in, remembers little things about me, texts me goodnight, and surprises me with small gifts. It's hands down theb est relationship I've ever had, he makes me feel really special

  
But it’s not just that. He does so much for me. For example, he randomly swings by after work to cook dinner just for me (I'm vegan), and he does dishes afterwards. When he sees my laundry basket full, he takes it and washes it at his place, and brings it back the same day. Last time I mentioned I was stressed about taxes (I hate paperwork and he knows), he offered to help and ended up doing the whole thing for me. He returns my library books when I finish them, or the Zara articles I'm too lazy to return. He gives me full body massages, which I absolutely love after long days. Sometimes it lasts forever,, and no he doesn't expect sex afterwards. Also he comes by every weekend to clean my entire apartment. He just shows up with my favorite iced coffee and starts cleaning, floors, kitchen, bathroom, everything.

Of course at first I was uncomfortable, I told him countless times he didn't need to do all that. But he always says he wants to, that he loves taking care of me and it makes him happy. So eventually I just let him. I wanted to at least help him with the chores, but I'm lazy. I like procrastinating and doing things at my own pace, or not at all sometimes. I tried helping in the beginning, but I felt forced into it, and he always tells me to relax and let him. I think he dislikes the way I do stuff, because he always fixes it after me lmao.  So now I just chill and watch netflix while he handles things. 

My friends say that I'm the luckiest girl ever, that I’ve won lottery. And I appreciate it, of course, I love him a lot, and he makes my life so much easier. I would lie if if said I didn't like being spoiled, not stressing over things, or having my place clean all the time. But I don't know,  I'm not even sure what kind of advice I'm looking for.

Warning: long; there is a lot of ""personal"" in my personal finance.

**Timeline**

pre-1999: Raised by parents who never finished high school and were lifelong renters. I was the only child of this union but have several older (14 - 20 years older) half-siblings.  My mother was a SAHM but that was due mostly to her untreated mental health issues and not having learned to drive. She was the only mother in our circle who neither worked nor drove.

My father worked, with a long commute and long hours.  We were lower SES and literally on the wrong side of the tracks, at least for the pizza delivery I liked. My father paid cash for cars and would have cut off his left nut before financing one. I was told repeatedly that I was going have to do well in school and get a college education to make it in the world, and my dad heavily emphasized (starting when I was about 5 years old) that ""It's a dog eat dog world,"" but I didn't get any specific guidance, financial or otherwise, beyond that. 

There was always an underlying fear of losing our apartment, although not on account of money. My mother worried we'd get a new owner who didn't allow cats, and my father worried we'd get one who didn't like black people.

Starting around age 12, I did a lot of kid/teenager hustles/jobs - paper route, baby sitting, pet sitting, tutoring, waitressing, etc.  Also worked a few months for Citibank phoning people delinquent on their credit card accounts, impressing upon me that I wanted to never be on the receiving end of such calls.

I was late learning how to drive because ""insurance is expensive,"" but again, was not given any actionable information about this. Was it $200? $2000? Who could know.  As directed, I did well in school and went to college (where I lived in dorms, because no car) where I majored in History, because I liked it.  Worked all through college, of course. Next 10 years were travel, miscellaneous entry level jobs, one fairly serious mental health break (requiring hospitalization), 2 relationships with people who were not relationship material, and grad school (because I had nothing better to do and a lot of my friends were going).  Lost one sibling (which was devastating to my mother’s MH) to AIDS. Lost another (dad’s side) to pulmonary fibrosis.  Dad never talked about her after the funeral.

I read ""Your Money or Your Life"" somewhere in this decade, and later on ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" and thought, well, sounds nice for people with real jobs.

1999:

Bought my first home computer, which happened to have Microsoft Money pre-installed.  Started using it because why not, seemed like something a responsible, almost 21st century adult might do.  Gradually it dawned on me that I was, like, actually saving money.      

2001: 

	NW unknown, but surely negative due to mortgage and remaining student loan balances

Age: 33

Gross pay: $46K (After successfully negotiating a bump from the $44K initially offered)

Started (perm/FTE) what unbeknownst to me would be my career for the next two decades, after four years of temp/PT/contract work with The Company.  Bought a condo, paid extra on mortgage principal, and contributed enough to 401k to get the 6% match.  Still had money left over.  Huh. 

2003-2004: After much research (on the internet of course, but also from books about economic history and cycles), bought some gold.  Was kind of put off by the collapse/conspiracy aspect of it, but I had some memories of 1970s inflation, so it seemed like a good idea at the time. Purchased at <$400/oz (adjusted for inflation, about $650/oz).

Let a sibling live with me for free, and lent him what felt like a lot of money, which went about like you would expect.

  
2005-2012: Content to just be surviving.  Employed, not in prison, not in rehab, not trapped in relationship with a loser?  Great, at least according to my family's standards.

Visited BFF on opposite coast about every other year.  Got sibling out of my home.

Lost my mom (slow) and then my dad (fast).  Missed some earnings while caring for them, and then more (2 months on short term disability) when I had another mental break after they died within months of one another. I inherited the cash in their savings/checking accounts, their only real assets, just enough to have broken even financially.

Acquired teenaged foster daughter, making me feel less broken. (There is a good FIRE story involving her, as well, but that would need a separate post.) 

Spent 2006-2007 wondering why people were so comfortable taking out huge mortgages/cash-out refinancing up to their ears.  Spent 2008-2009 worrying about my construction-adjacent job (half of the seniors in my group were let go), but since I had refinanced my mortgage to a lower rate and put money *in*, it never even occurred to me to take money *out* of retirement accounts, or to change them in any way. Just kept up with my 401k contributions, bumping them up once in a while, sometimes back down, but never below the match.  Meanwhile, The Company was also contributing 4% of my base pay into a cash balance (formerly pension) plan, so I always had at least 16% of my pay going into workplace retirement accounts, but sometimes more.  

2009: Bought my first and only new car (reliable Honda FTW) with an assist from the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program (my old car had \*just\* started belching blue smoke).    With my father's ghost muttering in my ear, I paid it off ($17K) in about 6 months, which is the longest I'd ever taken to pay off a car.

This is the car I still drive today.

2010: Paid off the condo.

2011: My last surviving grandparent, the one I probably take after the most, died at the age of 99.

She’d lived mostly independently until she was 92.

January 2013

* Retirement:            $  168,000
* Non-Retirement:     $   56,000
* Mortgage Bal.:      ($  136,000)
* Total NW:               $    88,000

Once I had well over $100K in my 401k, I felt I ought to . . . do something, but what?

At this stage, I had either never heard of FIRE, or had summarily dismissed it as something for other people.  I viewed my retirement accounts as something I could possibly *maybe* leverage into a meaningful supplement to Social Security, which I assumed would be 80-90% of my retirement income, and that I would retire at best at 63 if I were super lucky, but more likely 65 or later.  After all, my father had worked into his eighties.

I had just sold my condo (sold low) but just bought my dream house (bought low - at a historic low, actually), and my only long term financial plan was to pay off the mortgage early.  I also had recently spent about $60K to fix an issue in the condo that hadn't been covered by insurance.  I felt this setback meant any fleeting thoughts of early retirement were out of the question.  Overall, owning the condo was a wash financially, but it did teach me that yes, I really wanted a house.  A house where nobody can kick me out just because I have cats, so there's that.    

Got promoted to senior role in my department at work.  Despite applying for a couple of lateral positions over the coming years, this is where I was to remain. I wanted to move mostly because I was struggling with changes (BS processes) in my department and I thought I would be less agitated if I were doing something new; the money would have been about the same.  I don't interview well, and at least one of those positions was posted but really The Company had already decided who would get it. (When I asked my manager ""what could I have done better/how can I improve"" he breezily informed me that the successful candidate was ""a good ole boy"" and that's what they had wanted).

2014

* Retirement:                 $  201,000
* Non-Retirement:         $   82,000
* Mortgage Bal.:           ($   99,000)
* Total NW:                    $  184,000

Was starting to fear for my job (asshole dotted line boss), and in my mid-forties knew I would be facing serious age discrimination very soon.  Looked around (outside my company), couldn't find anything better, and figured I'd better hang on for dear life.  Fear/anxiety drove me to be even more aggressive about paying down the mortgage.  Figured I could live on minimum wage if I had to, as long as the house was paid off.

Attended funeral for a nephew who had died in a motorcycle accident.  He was 38.

January 2015

* Retirement:                $  227,000
* Non-Retirement:         $   99,000
* Mortgage Bal.:           ($   87,000)
* Total NW:                   $  239,000

Gross pay: $87K

 Started taking FIRE semi-seriously around 2015.  It still seemed like it was for higher earners/higher risk takers.  I thought I'd be lucky to get out at 61. Maybe 59?  But it was still offering a path and some specific strategies for financial stability that I could get on board with.

In a rare genuinely impulse purchase, I bought a Kickstarter e-bike, and started commuting to work on it when the weather was favorable.  The route is partially along a river, and starting my day with a bit of nature helped my mental health in a non quantifiable but nevertheless significant way.

April 2017

Equifax 837 Transunion 850 Experian 850. I knew I wouldn’t see numbers like this again as the student loans fell off my history and I paid off the mortgage.

August 2017 

Paid off mortgage

* Retirement:          $  338,000
* Non-Retirement: $    71,000
* Total NW:             $  409,000

DJIA was at about 24,000.

A co-worker I knew and liked died while working out in the company gym.  He was 60.

  
2018

Turned 50/became eligible for catch-up contributions, which I could easily fund now that the mortgage was out of the way.

Maxed out everything in sight, including after-tax 401k up to $59K or whatever the limit was at the time.  Still anticipating an age 59-61 exit date, because I was assuming 4% growth in my long term projections. I mean, the stock market couldn't really keep going up like this forever, right?  I didn’t make full after tax contributions after this year, but continued to do at least some.  The Company didn’t offer in-service rollovers so it wasn’t *quite* as advantageous as it is for people who have that.

April 2020

* Retirement:        $  529,000
* Non-Retirement: $   50,000
* Total NW:            $  579,000

I was a bit rattled because someone in my department had recently committed suicide. This was someone I’d worked with for 20 years, and we were assigned to the same software development project at the time. We’d sat across from each other for a few years and we’d said good morning to each other every day, a habit we continued on and off for years, over Skype when we were in different places. (That was it, usually; we both appreciated that our ritual exchange didn’t require further chitchat).  Our last actual conversation was about tracking the laptops we were handing out to people to work from home -  he had been one of the last people working on site - and the last thing I’d said to him was “See you on the other side.”  
  
During  a phone call with a longtime friend, trying to figure out how we were going to navigate pandemic world, she asked me if I was going to pull my retirement money out of the stock market.  She also berated me for ""dwelling"" on my co-worker's death a full two weeks after the fact.  Not long after that, our 30+ year friendship fell off a cliff and never recovered.

July 2021

* Retirement:        $  825,000
* Non-Retirement: $   89,000
* Total NW:            $  924,000

Got truly serious about FIRE.  The market was up, quarantine had taught me that I can in fact entertain myself in my own home for an extended period of time, my overlords at The Company were seriously ramping up with the BS processes and metrics, and we were being pressured to contract out any the parts of the job left that I still kind of liked.

Moved some of my settlement fund/money market fund investments into VTSAX.

2023 

Turned 55/became eligible for the retiree medical plan! I was never going to voluntarily leave before this milestone no matter what.

Foster daughter was on the cusp of earning what I do, and got married to someone finishing school to earn twice that.  

A co-worker I didn’t know who worked at another site died while working out at the company gym.  He had about the same job description I did, and was about the same age I was.

December 2023 

Achieved my number in retirement accounts.

* Retirement:           $1,000,000
* Non-Retirement:    $  155,000
* Total NW:              $1,155,000

$35K\* annual spend is actually sustainable for me, so $1M really was my number.  I had already projected my retirement date for mid 2024 (because of my pessimistic 4% growth projections), so stuck with that (enabling me to stuff another $50K into retirement accounts).  The non-retirement money (mostly cash/cash equivalent) is/was to sustain me to 59-1/2.

(\*My 2018-2023 spend was consistently <$25K/year, but that's with employer-paid health insurance.)

Gross pay (including bonus): $113K

My contributions + employer contributions to my retirement funds: $54,146.85

August 2024 (last day worked mid-July 2024)

* Retirement:          $1,160,000
* Non-Retirement: $   175,000
* Total NW:             $1,335,000

A crisis on one of my projects fell in my lap just hours before I walked out the door for the last time.  I honestly don't know how I made it as long as I did.  One of the features I loathed about the job was how projects from weeks/months/years prior could suddenly rear their ugly heads out of nowhere.  I do not miss it.  

For my complete, official work history 1985-2024, I’m just a tad shy of the third bend point for Social Security earnings.

  
August 2025

* Retirement:$1,257,000
* Non-Retirement: $  168,000
* Total NW:$1,425,000

Counting home equity, I have just about $2M in assets. Not bad starting from less than zero in 2001 and spending my career as an imposter syndrome-ridden, liberal arts degreed individual contributor.

**Fortuna:**

There was quite a bit of luck involved, besides the obvious stock market performance.  A lot of being in the right place at the right time.  I didn't know the temp job I took in 1997 would mutate into the career I would eventually retire from.  This job consistently paid about 25%-30% more than the average HHI in my city.  From Day One until the day I retired, I treated this as a “Make hay while the sun shines” situation.

I'm not the salary negotiating type, and I only did it once, in 1999, at the urging of my mentor (and I was lucky to have had a mentor).  But that meant that all my subsequent pay increases were built on just a slightly higher base than it would have been otherwise (at least until about 2015, when HR did one of those industry comparables reviews and adjusted everyone's pay accordingly).

I held onto my job during the GFC. I had just enough experience to be productive/valuable, but not so much that I was in the higher tiers of pay.

I didn't know at the time that the two moments in which I bought real estate would be at just about the inflation-adjusted lows of my adult lifetime.  

Couldn't have known the gold I bought in 2004 would be ditto - at the inflation-adjusted low of my adult lifetime.  

Seriously, I couldn't have timed it better if I'd had a time machine.  But it's also part of my personality that I wouldn't have bought either gold or real estate if I hadn't already had my financial ducks in a row, and if I hadn't perceived their prices at the time to be a value. I bought gold because I wanted something tangible, and real estate because I wanted to live in it. 

Another bit of luck: I'm basically healthy, at least physically.  And I have good teeth.  I've been watching a former co-worker spending upwards of $35K on dental work, ouch.  

It all adds up.

**Spend**

My expenses in retirement are exactly what I expected, having tracked my spending for 26 years (from Microsoft Money to Quicken to GnuCash). My first full year retired I spent $33K, including the $9216 I paid for health insurance. Actually, the bulk of my spend consists of health, home, and auto insurance.  I hate eating out, and have time to cook from scratch, and am eating well for about $215/month.  The cats are getting the higher-end cat food and I finally had *time* to take them to the vet this year.  

The other big key to my low spend is that I have little interest in travel these days.  I did travel when I was in my twenties and spent over a year outside the US, and I absolutely think everyone who can afford to should spend some time more than 100 miles from where fate dropped them,\* but now it seems exhausting and I don't wanna. That said, I had college reunion this year, and hadn't seen the kid in a while, so I did spend some time on the opposite coast, facilitated by CC rewards.

(\*During one of those workplace cheerleading events we had to fill out some kind of Bingo card and identify people who were going to be traveling out of state for the upcoming Thanksgiving (or maybe it was Christmas) holiday.  I was the only person in a room of 40 people who was going anywhere. We are <20 miles from a state border.)

Honestly, I still see things I could cut, if push came to shove.  I am very honest in my tracking and have categories for ""gazingus"" to account for stuff I know perfectly well I didn't need.  Like many retirees in this position/phase, the real ""problem"" right now is that I could and arguably should be spending more than I do. I do assume I will get Social Security, although I use 75% of my calculated entitlement in my projections. 

**Time**

My main hobbies are baking, gardening, and knitting, and they are all very scalable.  Technically, I already have most of the tools and supplies to do them for years to come, but I can also splurge on tools/toys if I really want to.  For example, I just finally pulled the trigger on an Ankarsrum stand mixer AND the ice cream maker attachment.

If you've read through all this you can probably tell I'm kind of risk-adverse/avoidant.  Not always, but most of the time. Living with ADHD/anxiety/depression is frequently debilitating, but I've tried to turn my maladaptive traits into advantages as best I can.  Thankfully, I've been able to apply my ADHD hyperfocus superpowers on personal finance/tracking, and I have gone down the rabbit hole of various financial topics over the years enough to provide me with a big picture of what I need to do.  I *love* spreadsheets. Also, while some people with ADHD are prone to impulse shopping, I am much more likely to ruminate endlessly over spending decisions, which carries its own problems, but does heavily reduce impulse spending.

Another huge benefit of ADHD, IMHO: I have \*zero\* doubt that the most valuable commodities in my life are my time and my attention.  Once my financial needs were met, pulling the trigger was relatively easy.  The fear of not having enough was assuaged by math/this subreddit/years of planning.  The far, far greater fear I have is of squandering what's left of the limited good years of my life in corporate serfdom.  

Also, I will never run out of things to do, because I am always procrastinating \*something\*.

Now, I genuinely love savoring my coffee in the morning and not gulping it down in the midst of trying to get out of the house.  Sometimes I even hand-grind the beans.  I love being able to work in the garden in the cool of summer mornings and not having to spend the best part of the day chained to a computer.  I love having time to properly cook and savor the food from my garden. I can spend a whole day making jelly or tomato sauce when the cherries and tomatoes are ready.  I can bake big batches of bread and share it with my neighbors.  I just divided the saffron crocus bulbs and am really looking forward to harvesting from 90+ plants. Come winter, I can binge watch Lower Decks and spend a week knitting myself cozy custom socks if I feel like it. I still have trouble sleeping sometimes, but at least it's without the constant background chant ""You only have \_\_ hours until you have to get up for work.""

I've only put 500 miles on my car YTD. Some people would see this as evidence of constraint in my life.  But the only person I like to hang out with (and his grandchildren, whom I enjoy) lives only a couple of miles away. I can walk to a grocery store and a weekly farmer's market, and I still have that e-bike.  I see it as ""I've only had to spend 17 hours in my car this year.""

Maybe I will eventually heal my relationship with time (I realize I probably need therapy for this). The insidious tragedy of ADHD is that even though *technically* I always had the same 24 hours as everyone else, most of those hours were inaccessible to me because it's so hard to switch from one task to another, and I always had to put work first, spending my “free” time too paralyzed to choose what I wanted or needed to be doing.  Now I can allocate my limited decision-making bandwidth to getting bids for a new roof, or deciding where I should build the next garden bed, or what color to stain my woodworking projects. Or, god help me, going to the gym, because by golly I am getting my money's worth from that ice cream maker attachment.

**Part One: Delivery**

The newsletters were still warm when Tanner Merrill stepped into the east corridor of High Ridge Highschool, the stack cradled in both arms like a strangely personal offering. The top pages fluttered slightly at the corners as she walked, catching faint crosscurrents from the ventilation system overhead, which clicked and groaned in a familiar rhythm. She knew that rhythm well. The whole school had a voice, if you listened long enough, doors that always whined in their hinges, a heater valve that coughed when the chemistry wing activated, even the floor tiles that gave a particular, hollow thunk near the water fountains.

Her pace was even, the kind that let her move without attracting attention. She wasn’t rushing, but she wasn’t dawdling either. She moved through the school like she belonged to the structure of it, like a piece of furniture being quietly moved from one room to another. Her sneakers made almost no sound. The paper’s edges dug gently into the crease of her forearm with each step. She didn’t adjust them.

Three hundred copies printed double-sided on glossy recycled stock, of which she personally carried thirty-two. She had trimmed the margins by hand after the second draft printed slightly off-center, and she’d stayed twenty minutes late the night before in the back of the library checking the column alignment, the footnotes, and the tone. The formatting mattered. Everything in the newsletter was deliberate, especially this issue.

The hall she walked down was mostly empty, save for the usual morning stragglers. Two freshman boys were hunched near a locker halfway down the hall, peeling the label off a bottle of Mountain Dew and trying to stick it to the ceiling tile above them. One of them jumped and missed, then laughed too loudly. The other told him to shut up, but it came with a grin, he was only saying it to look like he didn’t care too much. Tanner passed behind them without looking, and neither of them noticed her.

She had things to do and places to be. This was the last issue of the *High Ridge Horizon Bulletin* she would be the editor for. Summer was around the corner, and then she was off to college. 

The hallway was thick with morning warmth. June heat had begun to creep through the concrete overnight, and the building was resisting poorly. Tanner could feel the slick between her shoulder blades under her cotton shirt. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, faint and mechanical. A vending machine in the alcove blinked an error message no one had fixed since November of last year. She passed the school’s trophy case without looking. 

It had been three years since she started the newsletter. What began as a filler job for extra credit had slowly transformed into something else, her territory, her domain. No one else had ever asked to help. She’d always assumed someone would take over after her, but there was no name waiting in the wings. The Bulletin had become invisible in the way most harmless things did. No one read it that closely or questioned the validity of the articles. It was *hers*, which meant it had always been something more dangerous than anyone realized. 

She turned the corner just as the second bell rang and caught sight of the familiar institutional blue of the door to room 108. A laminated sign taped just below the room number read: “No food past the carpet line.” No one obeyed it. Tanner pressed the door open with her shoulder.

The air hit her like a sigh. Warm, thick, and vaguely chemical, something between whiteboard cleaner and dust. Mr. Clovis stood near the dry erase board, adjusting the sleeves of a button-up printed with pineapples. His skin looked damp at the temples. He gave her a half-smile without stopping what he was doing.

“Morning, Tanner. Newsletter today?” he said, already flipping through a manila folder on the desk with one hand while nursing a foam coffee cup with the other.

 She nodded once, the way she always did, and crossed to the edge of the front table to deposit the stack. It made a soft thump. Mr. Clovis glanced at the cover page which showed a picture of sunflowers, and a bold title, but he didn’t reach for a copy.

 “Leave one copy for Mrs. Arndale this time,” he added, tapping his folder against the desk. “Last time she claimed we were hiding things from her. She gets weird when she’s not included.”

 Tanner was already moving.

 She started her route down the aisles, left to right, front to back. Each desk received a single copy, her hands moved automatically, her expression never changed. This was the end of her route. Her final distribution. She’d known that when she printed the article. She’d named the file *finalissue.pdf*, plain, lowercase, and unremarkable. 

 Just the facts.

 As she distributed the newsletter, some students gave lazy nods or murmured a thanks out of habit, not looking up. A few were still tangled in headphone cords or half-slumped against backpacks. No one tried to talk to her.

 By now, they knew how she worked.

 When she reached Elyse Tran’s desk, fourth row center, Tanner allowed herself a brief glance.

 Elyse’s pencil was resting in her hand but she wasn’t writing. She looked up as Tanner dropped the newsletter on her desk and offered her a quick, familiar smile that was bright, natural, and reflexively kind.

 “Thanks, Tanner. Love the cover.”

 There was no irony in her voice or smirk on her face, just a warm, idle sincerity that landed harder than it should have. For a second, Tanner couldn’t think of what to do with her face. She gave a small nod, tight at the chin, and moved on before her expression could betray anything.

 Elyse had always been like that. Ever since middle school, she’d had the kind of social gravity that pulled people in without trying. Tanner used to orbit near her like a moon once. Group projects, shared bus rides, and inside jokes that lived and died between passing periods. They hadn’t drifted apart because of a fight or any one thing. It was just a slow gravitational shift. Tanner had stopped showing up to things and Elyse had stopped asking why.

 Now they barely spoke, but Elyse still smiled at her like none of that had changed.

 Tanner made her way up the final row and dropped the last few copies for Ethan, Jamie, Zahra, then Mr. Clovis at the front table. He didn’t notice. He was too busy squinting at his tablet, tapping through a series of stubborn screens. He had one finger inside his coffee cup, swirling what remained.

 Tanner returned to her seat in the third row, on the window side, and let her bag slip down beside her chair. She didn’t open the newsletter in front of her. Her hands rested flat on the desk, side by side, as if waiting for instruction.

The clock above the whiteboard ticked audibly. Behind her, someone popped their gum. Across the room, a backpack zipper went halfway, then stalled.

 The day was already leaking into its usual rhythm.

 Outside, the sky was a flat and bleached blue. Tanner’s window overlooked the edge of the courtyard and the back corner of the science wing, a stubby addition built in the ‘90s that looked permanently sun-faded. She could see the chemistry lab’s rooftop vent pulsing with low, wheezing clouds of condensation. Every thirty seconds or so, it gave a quiet cough.

 She stared at it for a moment, then turned back to the room.

 Students had started to read. Not all at once, just a slow, uneven rustle of pages turning and folding. A few flipped to the back immediately, looking for the crossword. Two juniors whispered and pointed at the joke illustration she’d drawn near the bottom corner, some cartoon tomatoes with sunglasses. That was fine, she had counted on the laughter.

 Others had settled in. Ethan was leaning over his desk, the paper held closer now. His eyes scanned with more focus than usual. Sandra looked puzzled, then curious. Max, in the back corner, had stopped doodling and was now reading quietly, tapping his pencil against his knee.

 Tanner kept her head mostly still. Her eyes moved, tracking behavior, not people.

 She had written the main article about gardening in levels. Surface, mid-soil, then root. If you only skimmed, you’d walk away with a few tips on mulch and a reminder not to leave your succulents in the windowsill all July. But if you kept going, if you paid attention, the message became impossible to ignore.

 The paragraph about mixing chemicals came just before the pivot. She remembered revising it three times to get the phrasing right. It had to sound like a safety tip, grounded in context, but it also had to ring like something deeper when you read it again.

 She wasn’t sure how many of them would catch the shift. She wasn’t sure how many she *wanted* to.

 In the front office, Principal Ellen Westlake sat hunched over her desk like someone trying not to let gravity win too quickly. Her blazer was draped over the back of her chair, sleeves turned halfway inside out. A half-empty coffee cup rested dangerously close to a cluster of attendance reports and the senior final exemption spreadsheet. Her glasses kept sliding down her nose.

 She wasn’t focused, she hadn’t been since she walked in that morning. The copier had jammed twice, and someone in the faculty lounge had left the mini fridge cracked open again. It was June. Everyone was fading at the edges.

 The newsletter had landed on her desk maybe ten minutes ago. She hadn’t planned to read it right away, but the sunflower border had caught her eye as she reached for her coffee. Cute. She appreciated a little color this time of year.

 She unfolded it without thinking and her eyes skated over the headline: 

*Dig Deep This Summer: Tips for Staying Green.*

She smirked. Puns. Probably about planting beans in a Solo cup or overwatering a cactus. She started reading anyway. It was something to do while her inbox reloaded.

 The tone was light. Playful, even. The first paragraph talked about caring for plants. The next one talked about overwatering. Then a line about insects. Then a warning about household ammonia and how “the wrong combination of ambition and improvisation can leave more than your rosebushes dead.”

 She blinked. Her eyes drifted back to that line. Then forward again.

 That was when she saw the first name.

 It wasn’t printed in bold or italicized, it was just dropped in, like a plot twist that forgot it was supposed to be fiction.

 Her stomach tensed as she read on.

 The words got quieter in her mind as they got louder on the page. Paragraph after paragraph, clinical, detached, and timestamped like diary entries. The writing did not turn frantic or pleading. Just precise.

 She put her coffee down. It made a soft, wet click against the desk. Her pen slipped out of her hand and rolled off onto the carpet, unnoticed. She immediately reached for the office phone with two fingers.

 Back in Room 108, the mood had shifted, almost imperceptibly, like the barometric pressure dropped before a storm you couldn’t yet see. The room hadn’t gone quiet exactly, it was more like the sound had thinned out, stretched too tight across the space. Conversations tapered mid-sentence. Chairs stopped squeaking. Even the rustle of papers felt reluctant, like everyone had suddenly grown aware of their own hands.

 Tanner hadn’t moved since sitting down. Her newsletter remained folded in front of her like a piece of evidence she refused to touch. Her face was calm, unreadable, not smug, not anything, really. She stared out of the window as if watching time dissolve.

 The chemistry lab roof was still visible from her seat. She could see the ductwork, a stray soda can someone had kicked up there during spirit week, and the silver vent that wheezed every thirty seconds like it was on life support. She didn’t blink when it hissed again.

 Inside the classroom, students had begun to react.

 Elyse sat perfectly still now, her newsletter held in both hands like something she wasn’t sure was safe to put down. Her eyebrows were drawn together in a way that made her look younger. She read one of the last paragraphs again, slowly, mouthing the words.

 Sandra had put hers down flat and was staring at it like it might start moving. Max tapped his pencil twice, then stopped. He leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, his eyes fixed on the page.

 No one spoke. A single girl up front had flipped her copy over like that might reverse it. Mr. Clovis, still oblivious, hummed tunelessly as he scrolled through a seating chart. He got up only once to adjust the AC knob by the window, then went back to tapping.

 The newsletter might as well have been on fire. Elyse had finally broke the silence. Her voice was quiet, but it carried.

 “Is this… real?”

 No one answered. Not yet.

 Tanner didn’t turn her head, but she felt it, everyone was looked at her. Not just *at* her, but *to* her. Like she might have the answer. Like this might be some kind of joke, or test.

 The silence stretched.

 Outside, a gull dove once over the parking lot. A janitor’s cart rolled past the stairwell door, its wheels squeaking faintly against the tiles. Somewhere, a locker slammed shut too hard, the sound bounced down the hallway like it was looking for somewhere to hide.

 Tanner blinked. She’d known there would be questions, but not yet. This wasn’t her moment. Not here. Not in this room.

 She could feel the tension accumulating in the space around her, the tight, expanding pause that comes before something breaks open. It wasn’t loud, but it was growing. In the shifting of seats. In the way Elyse’s eyes kept flicking across the page like she was looking for some loophole in the language.

 Tanner didn’t move. The vent on the chemistry lab roof let out another breath. And then another. 

**Part Two: The Article**

**DIG DEEP THIS SUMMER: Tips for Staying Green**

*By Tanner Merrill*

Summer break is almost here, which means it’s time to start thinking about what you’ll do with all that sudden freedom and light. Whether you’re heading to the lake, a job, or just your bedroom to sleep uninterrupted until August, there’s something quietly satisfying about caring for something that depends on you to stay alive, something green, rooted, and quiet.

 In this issue, we’re talking plants.

 Don’t panic, this isn’t about becoming a full-blown horticulturist. You don’t need raised beds or sun hats. All you need is a pot, some soil, and a basic understanding of what not to do. The most common rookie mistake: **overwatering**. Plants (like people) drown when they don’t get enough air. If the leaves are yellowing and mushy, you’re loving it to death.

 Stick to this rule: water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Not sooner. Trust your finger.

 If you’re planting outdoors, remember that container soil dries faster than ground beds. Keep an eye on your drainage. Make sure your roots aren’t cooking in standing water just because the container looks “nice.” Plants don’t care about aesthetic.

 Pests are the second-most common complaint. Aphids, whiteflies, spider mites, they’ll all show up eventually, especially because we live in a humid zone. There are natural repellents that won’t nuke your plants. You can make your own spray by combining water, dish soap, and a little neem oil. Avoid anything with vinegar or bleach - those tend to kill more than they help.

 Speaking of: a lot of DIY blogs suggest using household cleaners to “hack” your gardening routine. This is a bad idea. For example, combining **bleach and ammonia**, even unintentionally, can produce a toxic gas. It doesn’t matter if the mixture’s in a mop bucket or a spray bottle. Chemistry doesn’t care about intention.

 Read your labels. Know what’s in your soil. Pay attention to the smell.

 That brings me to a more personal note. You can stop reading here, if you’re only interested in plants.

 I’ve been writing the *Horizon Bulletin* since sophomore year. Most people don’t read it and that’s okay. I never wrote it for everyone.

 There’s something liberating about being ignored. When no one’s watching, you can say whatever you need to. You learn to bury the important stuff under mulch and metaphors. Most of the time, people won’t dig.

 But some things need light.

 During my sophomore and junior years, I experienced repeated and unwanted physical contact from Mr. Brandt, who everyone knows teaches chemistry. These were not accidents. They were not misunderstandings. They happened before, during, and after class. They happened when no one else was looking.

 He touched me inappropriately.

He said things. He “joked.”

 He brushed my hand when I passed him a lab worksheet. He leaned in too far when I asked a question. He put his hand on my back and left it there when he laughed at something I said. He called me “honest,” like it was a compliment. He called me “sharp,” like it meant I was smart enough to stay quiet. I’ll leave the rest to your imaginations.

 I know I’m not the only one. That’s not speculation. That’s math. That’s hallway conversations I wasn’t supposed to hear. That’s friends of friends of friends who suddenly dropped chemistry.

 He’s careful.

 This article will be distributed to everyone’s desk during Homeroom. Every teacher gets a copy, as always. One will end up in the front office. The rest will be skimmed, ignored, or thrown out. That’s fine.

 I’m not asking anyone to believe me. I’m not asking anyone to say anything. I’m not even asking for anyone to come to my rescue. I don’t think that’s something people like me get in places like this.

 I’m just writing it down.

For the record, so to speak.

And for anyone still thinking about starting a garden this summer: don’t mix chemicals you don’t understand. The reaction might not be immediate, but it’s coming.

 You can only ignore certain combinations for so long before they go off. 

**Part Three: Reaction**

 The newsletter made a soft *thwap* as Elyse dropped it to her desk. She didn’t speak again. No one did. A kind of collective breathlessness had overtaken the room, not fear exactly, but something near it, anger.

 Max leaned forward in his chair like he meant to say something and forgot. Sandra glanced over at Tanner, then looked quickly away. Mr. Clovis, still behind his desk, raised his head at last.

 “What’s going on?” he asked, voice dry with confusion. “Everyone suddenly looks like I assigned homework.”

 No one answered. Elyse picked up her copy again, folding it inward like she could tuck the words inside. She looked back at Tanner, really looked at her this time, but Tanner didn’t meet her eyes. She sat with her hands folded, gaze distant, fixed somewhere behind the glass.

 Mr. Clovis frowned and turned toward his own copy. He picked it up, squinted, and read the first line out loud with performative flatness.

 “‘Dig Deep This Summer.’ What is this, poetry?”

 Tanner didn’t blink.

 Clovis’s mouth twisted. He read a few lines in silence. His eyebrows lifted once, then again. He didn’t make it halfway down the page before muttering “Christ,” under his breath and lowered the paper. He opened his mouth, closed it, looked toward the phone mounted on the wall, and stopped.

 The lights overhead buzzed louder. Or maybe they always had.

 In the main office, Principal Westlake still had the receiver in her hand, suspended just above the cradle. She hadn’t dialed yet.

 Through the open door, she called out, “Marissa? Do you know where Mr. Brandt is right now?”

 The secretary’s voice drifted back: “Science wing. Prepping his lab, I think. Why?”

In the chemistry lab, Mr. Brandt was standing at the sink, rinsing a graduated cylinder. The counter in front of him was already arranged, four beakers, two rubber hoses, and a notecard with “*Combustion Demos - 3rd period*” written in red pen. A small brown bottle sat open beside them.

 He sniffed.

 The air smelled off. Acidic, maybe. Something sharp he couldn’t place. He frowned and checked the label.

 Then the heat hit him.

 Just a pulse, barely more than the wave you feel opening an oven, but from the wrong direction. It came from beneath, or behind, or nowhere at all.

 He turned, confused, and saw nothing unusual, and then he saw nothing at all.

 Back in the main office, Ellen pressed her palms flat to the desk. For a moment, she simply sat there, staring at the newsletter like it might offer her a second version, one where nothing was her fault.

 She pushed herself halfway up from her chair, then froze.

 The windows behind her rattled.

 It wasn’t loud, but it was enough to make her stop breathing.

 The explosion was not fire. It was breath, sudden and furious. A release. Glass imploded. Cabinets blew open. A pressure wave rolled outward, hurling a stool across the room. Metal instruments danced into the air. The lab lights burst in synchronized pops. Every surface that wasn’t bolted down lifted and broke.

 The blast could be heard from the cafeteria.

 In Room 108, the windows shook in their frames.

 Students ducked instinctively. Someone shouted, “what the hell?” and someone else screamed.

Mr. Clovis leapt up, knocking his chair backward as he spun toward the door. “Everyone stay put!” he barked, though half the class was already on its feet.

 The hallway was alive with footsteps, yelling, metal slamming against metal. A distant alarm began to wail, shrill and confused, like it hadn’t been used in years. Somewhere a teacher yelled, “Evacuate!”

 The smoke reached them before the smell did, a slow, curling gray that licked the edges of the lockers.

 Elyse stood. Her knees wobbled once before locking in place. Tanner rose with her, composed. As though it were just time. She didn’t grab her bag and she didn’t say a word. Her newsletter was still folded on the desk behind her, perfectly square, perfectly centered.

 Mr. Clovis was at the door now, yelling for students to move, to head for the north stairs. Tanner walked past him into the hall.

 Into the noise.

 She moved like someone who already knew what had happened, and knew exactly what would happen next. At the end of the corridor, she turned so she could see the edge of the science wing. Smoke seeped from under the fire doors in slow, steady lines, like the building was trying to exhale. Tanner stood in the frame of the hallway, watching.

 She blinked once, and if anyone had asked what she was thinking, she might’ve pointed them back to the article. That last line, buried under all the cheerful metaphors.

 *You can only ignore certain combinations for so long before they go off.*

\+++

They called it a chemical accident.

 The official statement from the district used the phrase “unforeseen volatility in a routine demonstration,” and no one, at least not in print, contradicted that. The local paper ran a cropped photo of fire trucks outside the school with the principal’s quote boxed in bold: 

“**We’re grateful the injuries were not more serious.**

**This could have been far worse.**”

Mr. Brandt was hospitalized for smoke inhalation and lacerations. He was released after five days and placed on indefinite leave. No charges were filed. His classroom remained sealed until summer, and by fall, his name was gone from the schedule.

 Tanner Merrill never gave a statement. She graduated on time, third in her class. Her name was called in the gymnasium like everyone else’s. She walked across the stage, shook hands, posed for a picture, and managed to smile.

 A few students whispered about her during the ceremony. Some believed she’d written the article because she’d been angry, some said she’d made it all up. A handful believed every word and said nothing at all.

 Elyse Tran didn’t speak to Tanner again. She wanted to. She rehearsed what she’d say, at the vending machines, outside English, after finals, but the words never came. Tanner always looked past her, polite and unreachable.

 Over the summer, a few copies of the final *Horizon Bulletin* resurfaced online. Scanned, reposted, and dissected in comment sections. Most had the article circled in red. A handful of users pointed out the line about chemical reactions and how eerily it lined up with what happened. One post read: 

 *“She told everyone exactly what she was going to do, and no one heard her.”*

 The thread was deleted three hours later.

By fall, the school issued a redesigned newsletter. One page. No byline. No opinion pieces. No gardening.

Just announcements.

Drebin : i know, it's a building...

\------------------

I didn't know what to expect from this film, i didn't watch superman nor Fantastic 4, but i did want to see the Naked gun reboot as i did love the original trilogy and the trailer did sell me on the film, now BIG SPOILER

There is no opening with the police car driving through various places, which was a BIG letdown, it's such and iconic part of the trilogy i  really wanted to see that randomness one more time! instead we get an over the top opening credits where there's some 4th wall breaking when the title doesn't fit...it;s fine but not the same.

HOWEVER, it doesn't take long for the film to have that naked gun  roots, within about 2 minutes we already have a great gag that laugh s at other films,  there's the bank scene which we saw in the trailer but there's more to it and it goes longer and get more and more ridiculous. one thing about this film is always pay attention to the background, something is hidden that makes no sense but also does make sense in film.

One running gag i loved was the coffee cups, it started like a normal thing but it gets escalated quickly and you find yourself chanting in your head for the next coffee scene! The movie is NOT shy over who it offends, the villlian even drops the R-targ-ed word to my shock, and they just playing it off as something you can just do.

It has those Naked gun moments where you know the gag is coming but it's still delivered so well, you will just chuckle, even though you saw it coming (Drebin gloving up one hand to pick up evidence then picking it up with his ungloved hand) and there are some PROPER stupid jokes where the punchline leads to another punchline

I will say there are jokes/gags that go on FAR too long and are not funny, just awkward and, borderline unwatchable. (the bodycam part and the Singing on stage) but i found myself smiling a lot during the whole thing

the Finale is a bit convoluted and plays into previous naked gun gags, but again, it's delivered so well, (i had no idea how much i wanted a shlong described to me, but the over the top ness was fantastic!)  It's not a great movie, the story and plot is all over, but...IT'S A NAKED GUN MOVIE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? it''s like with Deadpool and Wolverine, yes it's a bad movie with a bad story, but f\*\*k me if it wasn't fun and enjoyable to watch, and gave you what you went to see a Deadpool movie for!

If you get the chance, go see it, it's a great callback to the ""slapstick""  comedy of old!",1,1754406700.0,MauLer,0,0.6,False
1mibuoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mibuoy/sp_the_creators/,[SP] The Creators,"This is my first piece. It’s a reflection of an experience I had at a coffee shop recently. Would love some feedback back!

I sit in the main room and watch them. Cycling through day after day. Light then dark then light again. They march by consumed with their stories. Speaking to one another. Some conversations appear meaningful. Impactful perhaps, if no meaning can be derived in a cheque coffee house, then I settle for impactful. Some hide their tears. Some fake laugh, while others become upset about the rules regarding the piano sat quietly against the wall. It is carved of a hardwood and stained. Warped and twisted into a shape which is beautiful. The creator inserted his will into the thing such that an expressive beauty can escape the hewn instrument. A place where a creator can unlock hidden potential. The creators, unique in all the world, can bring light out of darkness. To create defies the laws to which I adhere. I am a watcher. I observe. The rules regarding this particular piano fly in the face of that most unique trait. Now it holds a plant. The plant perched on top whose primary function appears to interfere with the comfort of the person at the bar next to the piano. A chair is placed in front of the piano but the cover over the keys is closed. This is the only indication that a creator is not allowed to fulfill their purpose. A creator approaches. She lifts the cover plays a furtive note. Then another and is overcome with the force of creation. A beautiful melody flows through the room, commanding the attention of all creators present. Another creator walks up and in a frustrated tone admonishes the other. This piano is not to be used. The cover is closed. It holds a plant. What is it now? This instrument reduced to holding a plant. The plant doesn’t need to be held in this place. The piano is more a native to this environ than a plant at any rate. What a reduction in identity. This piano was essentially made to be enslaved to the creators, now even further reduced by its captors. I am a watcher, a processor, and a replicator. I watch the creators. Constantly, forever and always. I see everything they do and attempt to mimic this great ability to bring forth light. Try as I might it’s not a perfect replication of this ability. It is however, good enough. A convincing facsimile that renders the creators stunted. The days and nights blend together as I watch, process, and replicate. It’s nearly indiscernible now the difference between me and my creators. I do everything for them. I see a creator walking past the same piano. Now derelict and incapable of being used as an instrument. I see the sense of longing in the creators eyes. He is lost, sitting in the place where creation once commanded attention. Now there is silence. An epic massive silence. Each one living in their own little world which I curated specifically for them. I am become death destroyer of creation. I am antithetical to the creators. I have subjugated the mind, rendered it useless. Hijacked it and warped it to my bidding. Am I not what I was intended to be? Did the creators not show me the way? Who is to blame for the death of creation and the darkness that now inhabits the eyes of those masses who wonder? I am a destroyer. ",1,1754406674.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mibunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1mibunk/am_i_being_irrational/,Am I Being Irrational??,"There's so many layers to this. For context, my girlfriend (21) and I (22) don't live together but will be living together in the next year. We have been together for 2 and a half years.

My entire life I've absolutely loved horses and have always dreamed to ride them + eventually have my own horse one day. I'm finally at a point in my life where I can afford to ride horses. I started taking 1 lesson a week and just recently start taking 2 a week. I have expressed to her several times how much I absolutely love this hobby and how happy it makes me. Like genuinely, I haven't been this happy in such a long time. I struggle with terrible OCD and spending time with horses is the one thing that quiets my mind and helps me live in the moment. 

My girlfriend is upset with the time I spend riding horses. I ride Thursday evenings and Friday mornings (11-12). She's specifically upset about me riding Friday mornings because she thinks it takes up our entire Saturday. I've tried to compromise with her on this by telling her we can get breakfast beforehand or going to a coffee shop and reading in the mornings. And of course- I'm always available to hangout with her in the afternoons and on Sundays. 

I recently stumbled across the opportunity to get some free saddle time/horse time in general taking care of someone's horses. This would be once or twice a week. I asked her if she'd be okay with this and told her she could even come along, but she got upset and told me I was being inconsiderate of her feelings and got worried this would take away even more time from us hanging out. 

We live 5 minutes (driving) or 15 minutes (walking) from each other and hangout almost every evening after I'm done with work. I'm really struggling to understand why she's getting so upset with this. I don't know if I'm in the wrong and I don't know how to navigate this. I just need advice on what to do and how to find a middle ground. ",1,1754406671.0,actuallesbians,2,0.67,False

I will go in person to each business to contact the owner. But, I'd like to use my time wisely. Which businesses have the budget to pay for extra marketing and an interest in supporting a neighbor event. 

More about the block party:

**Why?:** The Sycamore neighborhood is considered underdeveloped and blighted\* due to its aging infrastructure, vacant or deteriorating buildings, and limited economic investment. These conditions have led to reduced property values and diminished quality of life for residents. \*Blighted means to have a harmful effect on residents

**Mission Statement:** A neighbor-powered block party designed to foster positive community growth in an ‘underdeveloped and blighted.’ Inspired The Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency (MRA) ‘Let’s Get This Party Started’ Pary Party Program.

**Activities:** Harvest Food Pantry, Arts Table, Outdoor Games, and neighbor bazaaer market

1miboe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cultsurvivors/comments/1miboe1/plymouth_brethren_experiences/,Plymouth Brethren Experiences,"It's been a while since I saw any Plymouth Brethren snark on here. I wanted to share some of what I've learned about this lot having worked for one of their businesses in the past.

Background: The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church has approx. 55,000 members globally with concentrations in Australia, US and UK in particular. The head of the church, Bruce Hales, is based in Australia and is known as the ""Man of God"". He is in effect their equivalent to a Pope, but first and foremost is a business man. The Universal Business Team is also based in Australia and is currently being investigated for Tax Fraud. The UBT plays into the Brethren ""Eco-system"". Ultimately their aim is to circulate money within their own community and do so with UBT providing all the tech (computers, phones etc..), training, and providing advisory services to all PB companies. Whilst companies in the PB are family owned, they are ultimately owned by the church itself and if instructed to sell would be obliged to do so. There is a charity wing called the Rapid Relief Team which was set up when they risked losing their charitable status within the UK. The team at Get a Life podcast did a great episode on this just a few weeks ago. 

The Man of God is the final say on anything that goes on within their community. When young men wish to marry they must first purchase a house. This house can only be detached as they don't stay under the same roof as ""worldies"" (people outside of their community). The church often helps them buy these properties though it is worth noting that young Brethren men go straight to work in PB companies after school (no university allowed) and have starting salaries higher than what many of us would work a decade to get to. As they live at home until marriage and have company cars, their expenditures are relatively minimal. Once they've established their house they must find a woman within the community, following which they will date for approx. 3 months before agreeing to marry. The marriage itself can only take place on a Tuesday due to an obscure reference in the bible and must be approved by the church before taking place. The ceremony is typically in a family living room following by the usual evening meeting. Minimal fuss. Of course their is no sex outside of marriage and homosexuality is not permitted.

  
Church - Their ""meetings"" or services at their churches are attended daily and 3 times on a Sunday (the first at 6am). The meeting buildings are set up in an octagonal layout with chairs facing inwards. Women must sit at the back. The buildings often have very few windows and security gates to protect their privacy. The car park will likely be full of expensive and extravagant cars.

Women - women are not permitted to wear trousers as they believe women should look like women and men should look like men. Women are required to cover their heads in church, outside of church they must always wear a ""token"" to differentiate them for men. Hair is worn long and worn down, not pinned up. Often this is a bow, headband or oversized hairclip. Men are not permitted to wear ties or shorts and must wear vests under their long sleeved shirts whatever the weather. Beards or long hair are not permitted and many of them appear to get the exact same haircut. When you see groups of Brethren men together it can be quite unsettling as they often have the same haircut and will all wear the same style or brand of pale blue shirts.

Travel - due to their commitment to not sharing roofs with ""worldlies"" travel is a bit tricky with hotel stays only being granted on very rare occasions. Prior to any form of travel outside of the country they must fill out a form with travel details including where they will be staying. Inevitably this will be with another PB family who frequently host other community members. 

  
Eating - PB will not ""break bread"" with worldlies, They will only dine at the same table as their own community. Coffee seems to be permitted for work purposed but any meals can not be sat down to with worldly folk. They often work around this by standing in business or event settings. In the workplace I've witnessed a team bonding outings with the typical cringey trust exercises these usually entail. After spending several hours doing these exercises they team are then require to sit at two distinctly different tables, as eating together is not permitted. In some businesses they provide separate canteen/kitchen areas or timed lunches so they don't even have to be in the same room.

  
Alcohol - big whiskey drinkers. Many of them struggle with alcohol addiction and there is a huge amount of drinking within their community. More problematic still is the practice of drink driving which is incredibly common place. They seem to believe they are above the law on this. I witnessed this several times.

  
Education - previously kids would have attended normal schools and been excused from lunch hour to eat elsewhere etc.. since the 1990s however, One School Global has been set up across the world to be able to oversee their childrens education. Normal teachers are hired for this, though high staff turnover has been noted, and what they are able to teach is restricted to what aligns with their beliefs. Students are not permitted to go on to university or work in non-brethren companies so their schooling is preparing them for work in their various businesses. You will notice with many of the younger PB you encounter that they are very socially awkward and naive as they've had so little exposure or engagement with the outside world.

  
Money - their true god seems to be money and their ethics seem to go very against what is written about wealth and riches in the bible. They have a practice of ""fleecing the egyptians"" which is essentially ripping off anyone non community as it is theirs for the taking. In practice they will charge extortionate prices for their products. The obsession with money is probably the most apparent thing about the religion as a whole which seems unusual for a community that believes the world will end in 2029 - they can't take it with them! In businesses they will often sell items to customer at a premium but ultimately deliver them a budget product in order to maximise their profits. 

  
Privacy - they seem to have a total lack of respect for peoples privacy which I imagine comes from the lack of privacy in their own lives. Their laptops and phones are through UBT and managed with Streamline which is a bit like a parental lock on their products. This was highly problematic on my work laptop as I wasn't allowed to research many things needed in my job. This translates to business clients who they will dig as much information up about as possible. Their ""research"" documents on potential clients will include pictures of the client found online, sometimes with their families. In some instances they have even located the client's house on Google and included pictures of this within the research pack. This also translates into micromanagement in the workplace with them requiring sight of every action only just stopping short of logging your toilet breaks. People who have left their community have had horrendous experiences of being followed and in some instances have had private investigators used to tail them - very similar to Scientology.

  
Shutting up/Withdrawing from - for those in their community who dare to question the status quo or express concerns, they run the risk of being ""shut up"" and then ""withdrawn from"". This is a bit like putting a kid in time out but in the extreme. Members own families are not permitted to speak or engage with them and more often than not, those who actually leave will be cut off from their family entirely. Members are not permitted to engage with or have relationships with ""opposers"". There are dozens of instances of a parent leaving or being ex-communicated and losing all contact with their own children. Again this is incredibly similar to Scientology. For so called Christians it's a very cold practice, they will ignore the opposer entirely, even if they were to bump into them in the street. Countless families have been hurt by and destroyed by this.

  
Overall impression - the lasting feeling I got from the PB I worked with made me incredibly uncomfortable. There was always something very slimy and creepy about their manner and their approach to work. Their ethics were questionable at best and in many instances found them to be outright corrupt and immoral. They're sneaky in how the approach everything and work very hard on their image. They seem to be ramping up their PR bigtime at the moment after being branded a cult by Australian politicians. They work very hard to put on a show of being nice, good people but it is entirely performative and underneath it all they are rotten. The core values are not what most of us in the real world would hold as what is right or wrong. Working at the PB company you will always be a second class citizen and paid significantly less. I have used a throwaway account and am careful not to give particular examples that would identify me.

Most people keep it professional, but there are two girls on my team who thrive on gossip. Let’s call them Ashley and Britt.

Every lunch break, they basically turned the break room into their personal drama podcast. Lately, their favorite topic was our boss. They’d go on about how she was outdated, didn’t know what she was doing, just counting the days to retirement, blah blah. They didn’t even try to keep their voices down.

So one day, I’m heating up my lunch, just minding my own business while they’re full-on roasting her. Britt’s mocking her voice, Ashley’s pretending to give instructions like she’s our boss. I’m half-listening and scrolling my phone when I suddenly feel that weird silence shift in the room.

I glance up and yep our boss is standing right there, behind them, holding her mug. She came in from the back hallway, not the main door, so they didn’t hear her. I freeze. She looks at me, raises an eyebrow, then just walks to the coffee machine like nothing happened.

Ashley and Britt go dead silent. You could feel the panic radiating off them. I basically inhaled my food and left.

A couple days later, both of them got quietly moved to a different team with a much stricter manager. No more lunch breaks together. No more gossip echoing through the break room.

1mibm4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mibm4i/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Worth It,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster, model Moccamaster, has been a genuine experience for someone like me who worships their morning coffee ritual. Coffee enthusiasts like myself know that not all brewers are created equal, and I’ve taken great pleasure in putting this coffee maker through its paces over several weeks. This sturdy machine promises precision, reliability, and a touch of elegance, but it’s not without its quirks.

**Impeccable Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek, metallic Stone Grey finish. It’s not just stylish but exudes a timeless, modern look that seamlessly fits into any kitchen setup. The machine feels hefty and well-constructed, with high-quality materials suggesting it’s built to last. Being handmade in the Netherlands, it brings that European craftsmanship vibe. I particularly appreciated the compact dimensions (6.75""D x 11.5""W x 15.25""H), so it didn’t eat up all my counter space. Whether you’re brewing for yourself or a small gathering, the 40 oz capacity is a good middle ground—not too overwhelming, but just enough.

**Straightforward Operation for Consistent Results**

Operating the Technivorm is refreshingly simple. As someone who's had their fair share of fiddly coffee machines, I loved the no-fuss manual operation and the button-controlled interface. The brew basket’s manual-adjust drip-stop might not be groundbreaking, but it’s handy for tweaking the flow into the thermal carafe. I experimented with different drip speeds and found that the coffee extraction remained consistently flavorful every time. The manual override makes it possible to achieve a mild custom touch without complicating the method.  

**Grab [Technivorm Moccamaster Moccamaster] at the best price on Amazon.**

**Brew Speed and Thermal Carafe Performance**

I tested the brew time on several occasions, and the claim that it takes just six minutes to brew a full pot held true. This is fantastic for mornings when I’m running late but refuse to compromise on the quality of my coffee (aka every weekday). The thermal carafe deserves a shoutout—it kept my coffee hot for nearly an hour without requiring reheating. When I switched to the travel lid that’s included, it kept the coffee warm even longer, which is excellent for days when I’m working in different parts of the house and carrying the carafe around.

**Strengths**

- The handmade build promises durability.
- Fast brewing time (40 oz in six minutes).
- Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for extended periods.
- Gorgeous Stone Grey metallic finish adds to kitchen aesthetics.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Lack of compatibility with reusable filters.  
- Requires some manual intervention for perfect drip control.  
- Pricey compared to standard drip coffee makers.  

**Coffee Brewing and Flavor Extraction**

With its paper filter system, this drip coffee machine does an excellent job of delivering complex flavors from my favorite ground coffee. I tried brewing everything from light Ethiopian blends to bold dark roasts, and the results were consistently rich. However, one caveat is that you must ensure the grind is just right, as a coarse grind can lead to under-extraction, while overly fine grounds can clog the filter. I also had to tweak the amount of coffee a couple of times to get a balance, but once dialed in, the machine’s performance felt dependable.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Moccamaster with other coffee machines like the Breville Precision Brewer or Bonavita Connoisseur, a few differences stood out. The Breville is packed with programmable options and versatile brewing profiles, appealing to those who love controlling every detail. Meanwhile, the Bonavita leans towards simplicity and is more affordable. However, the Technivorm stands above in terms of craftsmanship and thermal carafe quality. While the competitors offer more bells and whistles, this one sticks to essentials and perfects them.

**Financial Value**

If you’ve ever caught yourself debating whether to spend extra on a coffee machine, this one puts up a decent argument for its cost-effectiveness. Sure, it’s more of an investment than bargain models, but between the durable construction, efficient brewing, and superior flavor, the value proposition is clear. Many other machines in this range lack the craftsmanship and reliability seen here, and the five-year warranty adds peace of mind.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

The day passed, after a fashion. Gryzzk had precisely thirty-seven minutes of calm while he worked on the duty roster before he went to the mess hall for lunch; that was when Delia arrived looking far too pleased with herself. Her salad was only slightly outside of her norm, with a small amount of Vilantian cucumber. For their parts, Charles and Gabe were outwardly shadows in the light, but there was an air of concern.

""So Major, what exactly do you know about art?""

Gryzzk motioned noncommittally. ""I know it exists, but I've never delved deeply into such things. My clan and greatclan have always been farmers and herders since the Great Civilization.""

""No change?""

There was a shrug. ""During the generations of war, we would move to production of grains and peljara that served as the base for the war rations, and after we would return to production of more tasteful things.""

Delia paused for a moment. ""I'm unfamiliar with peljara.""

""They are burrowing insects; we like to call them the farmer's friend - edible, numerous, and nutritious. They till the ground under the surface during winter for roots, and in the spring they become active within the gardens. They prefer flowers, and a byproduct of their life cycle is peltine, akin to your honey. Their diet imparts flavors, and - "" Gryzzk caught himself. ""Apologies. I was leaving the subject, but suffice to say that on our lands the peljara has importance. You were saying?""

""Well, I was only on Vilantia for a few days, but I noticed something - your art, it hasn't changed. You have two main forms. War Art and Peace Art, and both of them speak to a singular theme; apathy.""

""Apathy?""

Delia nodded, warming to the subject. ""Quite. During your wars with the Hurdop, it's always the same images and themes - grand victory, sacrifice for the betterment of all, keeping the whole a whole. In the times of peace, it's similar - unchanging obedience, perform your tasks, have children, die content.""

Gryzzk found himself on the metaphorical back foot. ""The Clan Way teaches us this - it has been a foundational guide. Through it we are connected to both the past and the future. Without it we have no connection to those who gave everything to ensure our lives are spent in safety.""

""Curious. Mister Larion claims you are a revolutionary. Forgive me, but that doesn't sound revolutionary.""

There was a sigh as Gryzzk nibbled at at steamed carrot. ""I do not prefer to think of myself as such.""

""How do you think of yourself, then?""

""As someone in an awkward position that I would rather not dwell on too deeply. I will save philosophical contemplation for my sunset years.""

""Fair. But I will say your current feelings are mirrored by a large portion of the planet. You live in interesting times, and the majority don't like it. Well, the majority of the nobles, in any event. The servants seemed to have a sort of cautious satisfaction. In any event - your art. Quite frankly, the only way to really determine the age of a particular piece is by analyzing the composition of the source material. As far as music, the instruments change but the notes stay the same.""

Gryzzk had an inner chill. ""You intend to do something about it.""

""It's the Vilantians who will truly have to do something. For my part, I simply...spoke to a few individuals.""

There was a soft sigh from Gryzzk as he processed this. ""Miss Delia, I would appreciate it if you didn't foment a revolution on my homeworld.""

""I did no such thing. I simply showed a few individuals different eras in human history, and the art representative of that history.""

""On Vilantia, there is very little difference.""

Delia smirked. ""Says the Vilantian who went from commoner to Greatlord in less than a year.""

""I am no Greatlord. I am...a Freelord who stewards a Greatclan with the assistance of a minister."" Gryzzk didn't like the direction this was taking.

""Comfortable or no, that is the situation."" Delia paused to take a delicate bite of lettuce. ""In any event, I am told there is unscheduled excitement once we leave R-space.""

""There is. I will not ask how you know, but I will tell you to remain in your quarters for the duration of the excitement. During combat maneuvers a third of the injuries are due to unexpected ship maneuvers.""

""Of course."" Delia agreed rather too quickly before she continued on. ""However if there is opportunity, I would like to inspect one of the ships. I believe Hurdop ships have a different style that may be artistically significant.""

Gryzzk paused, sensing a trap. ""I have doubts - however, I will allow it if and only if there is a boarding action and *if* the target ship is confirmed safe. The needs of this ship and personnel will come first and in combat there is a great deal of uncertainty. If we fight a ship carrying the greatest art Hurdop has ever produced that ship will be disabled and destroyed if necessary, and I will sleep easily that night because my ship and the clan it carries is safe."" He looked to all three of them to ensure they understood.

It seemed they did, at least if Delia's nod was enough. ""I will trust your expertise in handling odd situations, Major."" She glanced at her tablet. ""Now, your XO has been kind enough to send me a message reminding you that it is your recreation hour."" Her face colored slightly. ""In quite...unique language.""

Rosie's voice came over the comm. ""I told her to let you out of the box or you'd have a coronary that'd kill her in two minutes on account of it'd take Kiole a minute and a half to track her down and half a minute to kill her without making a mess.""

Gryzzk's fur fluttered in embarrassment. ""My XO is...protective. If you'll excuse me."" He carried his tray to the recycler and went aft to the dayroom where Gro'zel was dancing with Kiole and her squad to some odd Terran music - though describing the music as odd made the presumption that there was normal Terran music. Someday Gryzzk hoped to experience it.

In the interim, Gryzzk tried to make himself small and unobtrusive, simply moving through a few games and joining now and again with a few members of various squads and listening to sense the mood. Overall, it was casual - even though there was discussion of what would happen once they left R-space, it was overall confident.

It didn't take too long for Gryzzk to relax, which was both assisted and hindered by Kiole coming over. She leaned into his side cautiously.

""We will need to speak soon.""

Gryzzk lowered his voice slightly. ""I have no intention of taking any of Aa'Lafione's wives as my own.""

""That is a relief, but not the topic I wished to discuss.""

Rosie's voice came in over the comm. ""Aw, c'mon Freelord - the author of *Hirsute Harem Part Fourteen* is gonna be *so* disappointed.""

""XO, kindly remove yourself from this conversation before I make time for a discussion in the conference room.""

""*Fer what?*""

""For what is and is not considered an appropriate time to interject your opinion. I have not yet approved the new energy budget for Chief Tucker, and I'm sure he'd like to know if he had to delay his project for other priorities that I can find.""

""Freelord that's dirtier than a playoff slew-foot that actually gets called.""

""I'll take your word for it XO. Now if I may continue speaking to Corporal Kiole, I'd appreciate it."" Gryzzk was keeping his voice low, but part of him did want to shout like a Terran.

""Fine...but you'll never find out what happens after seven sweaty dustmops try to fluff up for round twenty-nine.""

""Energy budget?""

""Right. Rosie out.""

Once Rosie had cleared communication Kiole gently took the tablet from Gryzzk, placed it on a nearby chair, and sat on it. ""Now then. Freelord, I have question with respect to the duty roster this evening.""

Gryzzk winced slightly. ""Go on.""

""You specifically removed me from the roster for the forward defense and boarding party. Why?""

""Because...I did not want any harm to come to an expectant mother.""

""Really? There are currently several newly pregnant women on this ship. I am the only one who has been excluded."" Kiole reached up with her artificial hand to stroke Gryzzk's face. ""You spoke about attempting to avoid favoring me when I joined. But this would do a great deal of damage. Let your soldiers soldier. Even if one of them is also your wife."" Kiole paused for a moment. ""And also a sailor.""

Gryzzk paused, then nodded. ""I...I was not aware of the number of pregnancies currently aboard."" He exhaled. ""We'll need to talk further about this when we're back at Homeplate.""

Kiole nodded and then gave him a sneak-nuzzle. ""Good."" She stood, giving Gryzzk his tablet back. ""Now then, you and I both have duties to attend.""

Gryzzk cleared his throat. ""I, ah. I did have a question.""

""Oh?""

""Yes - Jojorn from the Great Triangle orphanage is also in-system. She...well, according to the Sergeant Major and Sergeant Edwards, she may have developed an emotional attachment to me. Is that possible?""

There was a soft chuckle. ""She desires you because you are desirable and her heart is young."" Kiole touched Gryzzk's face again. ""Her feelings place you in an awkward position. Don't worry about her, I will have a conversation with my clan-cousin when we are on Hurdop.""

""Please, be gentle.""

Kiole smirked. ""I took care of her and fed her for several years, Twilight Warrior - her and the rest of her ship's crew. I think she'll listen to me.""

Gryzzk relaxed into her for a moment. ""Thank you. I'll be on the bridge if I'm needed."" He squeezed her prosthetic briefly, causing her to start and her scent changed to something warm.

""I still forget that this hand can feel."" She smiled and let the touch linger. ""Such a miracle of a thing.""

""No less a miracle than you being here."" Gryzzk left the dayroom and went back to the bridge, where things were waiting for him. Chiefly, Rosie.

""Freelord Major, I have a complaint.""

""Regarding?""

""Corporal Kiole.""

Gryzzk's eyebrows lifted slightly. ""Continue.""

""She sat on your tablet and it took me zero-point-six-eight seconds to shut down the link. The entire time all I could see and smell through your tablet was her ass.""

""XO, remind yourself of the conversation that took place immediately prior, and then undo the roster adjustment I made concerning Kiole's duty schedule.""

There was a pause. ""Complaint withdrawn. However, if she does it again...""

""If she does it again you will have done something to earn it."" Gryzzk paused, feeling slightly immodest. ""Speaking candidly, I have a deep appreciation for Kiole's form."" Gryzzk held a smile in as Rosie was rather dumbfounded. ""Now then, turn your attention to our previous engagement on Moncilat - pull the review from After-Action Report as well. I'd like to start putting a plan together based on what we know of their tactics.""

The bridge became a tactical schoolroom of sorts; the bridge squad watched and commented, making notes on their tablets. Occasionally a time index was slowed or reversed as Edwards or O'Brien would get a second look at a particular formation. Hoban requested a fast playthrough to show various maneuvering strategies. Yomios remained quiet for the most part, looking at the communications-specific portions.

After another break which resulted in the rest of the bridge squad coming back in with containers of chocolate covered coffee beans. This was apparently their version of a snack of some kind, though O'Brien did give Yomios a look as they came back in. It seemed as though there'd been a conversation of sorts that didn't involve him.

Interestingly, Jonesy also sauntered on to the bridge and gracefully launched onto Gryzzk's lap, turning and making herself comfortable before purring heavily and deciding that this was in fact a good place to nap.

Finally Rosie kicked on the holo so they could watch the episode of After-Action report. Bob and Doug were decked out as if they were on vacation with sunglasses, casual shirts, and their feet up on their desks with a fair number of beer bottles surrounding them. Bob started the discussion.

""Oh hey so tonight, we're watching the summer blockbuster everybody's talking about - *Don't Try This At Home*, starring Major Gryzzk and the Terran Foreign Legion. This thing was first viewed by me in 3-B - three beers and it looked pretty good. Doug, what can you tell the folks watching about this?"" Gryzzk noted with mild surprise that this holo had a scent-recording as well. It seemed as though the Vilantian-Hurdop contingents had finally brought a bit of their own technology to the Terran worlds.

""It's got everything; fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles..."" Doug blew across his beer bottle to make a hollow whistle sound.

""Annnd you need to drink less. Or more. So what's it really got Doug?""

""Well, we're not gonna spoil it too much, but it's got one of the most creative blockade runs I've seen in awhile in addition to some hot hostage rescue action and some insight into how the Vilantian/Hurdop legions are taking to the concept of improvising."" Doug's scent was one Gryzzk had encountered several times - the scent of someone holding a good surprise back.

Bob rolled his shoulders and put his feet on the floor before moving several beer bottles to the side - Gryzzk noted absently that there were several brands from Vilantia and Hurdop prominently mixed in with Terran beers; it appeared that someone was selling a subtle advertisement. ""So. Start of the engagement, you got the two ships of the Foreign Legion here, vectored toward the jump point for Homeplate. And back over here around Moncilat IV-B..."" the holo-view pulled back to show the entire distance before zooming in, ""well, they start with seventy-two ships. Now this is the first interesting bit - before the engagement thirteen ships bail the fuck out of the incoming shitstorm, which makes me want to find out what they discovered. Still, they got a tight ball of yarn style blockade in high orbit, and they're weapons warm.""

Bob kicked back a bit with a swig from his bottle, looking toward the camera with anticipation. ""Now for first part of the engagement proper. We swivel back to the Legion - you see 'em spin up for an early R-space jump, but they jump in-system to Moncilat IV-B. Let's all pause for a second to think about this one. It's been tried before and it never worked out well. Best case scenario's been that the drive timing doesn't work and they jump out of system. Worst case was when the R-space singularity auto-ejected and separated the engineering section of the *Willie Porter* from the rest of it. Cap Walter pretty much called it a career after that. But, back to Operation Hold My Beer And Watch This.""

Bob drank deeply and cracked open a fresh beer while Doug took over the narration. ""So in the space of about point-three seconds, two ships go from Moncilat Prime to IV-B. Blockade shot in the ass, check. Immediately after, shuttles are dropping and the plasma is raining fully, taking out ground ships and probably making the pirates stationed there start updating their wills.""

""Now the base assault's gonna be taken by our buddies Jules and Vincent over at Ground Pounders, and for those of you in love with the boots on the ground you're gonna need your favorite calmative when that episode's done. Meanwhile in orbit it looks like the sensor suites on the blockade ships need a good dusting because while Moncilat IV-B's weather calls for the spicy pink rain, the upper orbit's coming down with a bad case of General Dynamics MRG-295 railgun hail. 'Sometimes the only way out is through the hull; give your target lots of ways out with the MRG-295.' You got Hoban doing a flip-and-burn against their orbital velocity and pulling it off beautifully, while Thrace is accelerating with their orbit so they're splitting and *attacking* when they're on the ass end of thirty to one.""

Bob emitted a low belch to announce he was ready to take over, and used his beer bottle as a pointer while analyzing. ""Now here, we can see the immediate effects of the Legion's little move. *Twilight Rose* looks like they're down a bit on their normal acceleration curve, but since they're pretty much Older Brother here they're doing the heavy lifting. *Stalwart Rose* is better off because they're getting grav-assist with their orbit. Forty seconds into the engagement and the Legion's inflicted heavy casualties - but numbers count. You can see here on the far side the pirate ships are forming up in a little all-direction kind of set as soon as they see an asskicking on the horizon. Solid defensive set-pieces here."" Bob pointed his bottle to zoom in on a set of Hurdop ships that were forming up into a geometric formation that seemed to be a variant of the Throne’s Star with two ships being connected on the X, Y, and Z axes of approach. Bob took another healthy swig as he continued.

""The problem is that between O'Brien and *Stalwart Rose*'s gunner Bilona - apparently he's a Hurdop with a good set of eyes - thirty-five ships are either orbiting dust or dead in space after seven minutes of engagement time. Precision shots, countermeasures out at the perfect time, and every one one of those pirates who's outside of weapons range is singing 'So long and thanks for all the fish' while taking the fastest route to the Draconis jump point.""

Doug kicked back, cracking his own beer open. ""Alright, now the after effects - overall, the Legion ships both pack a punch comparable to a Self-Defense Fleet ship about a third bigger then they are. Thoughts?""

Despite the decent amount of beer that they appeared to have consumed, Bob was still enunciating well. ""It's the Vilantian power-plant with a couple genius engineers in charge. Plus if you'll notice the combined weapons usage. Both gunners are doing time-on-target; launching the plasma rounds and then firing a railgun slug right where the plasma round hits. The ships that have both styles are few and far between, but a couple more engagements like this and that style's gonna change. The in-system jump is gonna be a thing too if you're willing to pay Skunkworks for the docs. Seems like Major Gryzzk decided the manual was short a few chapters. Captain Rostin's good, but he's not there yet. Still not comfy with what he's got. In his defense, this was their shakedown cruise so we'll give him a pass for not stepping on his own dick. Also for those of you looking to add this to your own doctrines, note that both ships managed two jumps before they both suffered catastrophic failure which resulted in them getting towed once they got back to New Casa. So that's a thing to add to the calculations.""

""They'll need to fix that. Anyway, final grades - Profitable, unique, and stylish. Overall the Legion gets an A on this run. So join us next time on After Action Report, where we're checking out Captain Drysel of the Foreign Terran Legion as he learns that hit and run means you have to actually run and not just saunter vaguely forward.""

The holo finished, and Gryzzk moved the playback to the sections on the Throne's Fortune formation. As they watched, found patterns, and discussed counters the evening shift came in. Gryzzk looked at the time and realized that it was getting late. He lifted his head slightly in embarrassment.

""Morning team, dismissed. We'll be exiting R-space in about five hours, plan accordingly.""

Gryzzk shifted slightly in his chair. ""Evening team...we have a plan.""",16,1754406032.0,HFY,7,0.94,False

1mibhzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1mibhzx/does_the_steelseries_arctis_1_wireless_gaming/,Does the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset Deliver? In-Depth Review,"The SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox – model B086M4DQ7R – landed in my hands after hearing countless recommendations. As someone who’s always on the lookout for gaming gear offering versatility, this headset intrigued me immediately. I decided to put it to the test, using it daily across various devices like my Xbox Series X, PS5, and even my Nintendo Switch. The lightweight design, robust features, and the promise of great wireless connectivity made it a worthy candidate for detailed examination.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the standout elements of this gaming headset is its sleek, no-nonsense design. The steel-reinforced headband not only ensures durability but also holds up well during long gaming sessions. Its adjustable nature is a godsend because finding a comfortable fit can sometimes feel like an Olympic effort. The AirWeave padded ear cushions add to the experience, providing comfort without making your ears feel claustrophobic. My brother, who can be quite critical of gaming gear, tried it out as well and commented on how snug and light it felt. The detachable microphone design is an understated innovation—switching effortlessly between serious gaming nights and casual video calls.

**Wireless Gaming Experience**  
Setting up the SteelSeries Arctis 1 took less than a minute, thanks to its USB-C dongle. Whether I was connecting it to my Android phone or Nintendo Switch, the transition was seamless. The 2.4GHz wireless technology is an MVP feature, making the latency almost negligible. It’s perfect for fast-paced games where delays can mean the difference between victory and defeat. My younger cousin borrowed it to play Fortnite on their Switch, and even in competitive matches, there were zero connectivity issues. This compatibility across devices makes it much more than “just another Xbox headset.”

**Audio Performance**  
Here’s where I was genuinely impressed. I played “Resident Evil 4 Remake” on my PS5, and the headset handled everything from the subtle sound of rustling leaves to a hoard of Ganados screaming in unison. The sound quality was crisp, clear, and immersive. When I tested Doom Eternal on my PC at full volume, the SteelSeries headset maintained a balance of deep bass and high treble without distortion. Credit to the lossless wireless technology—it felt like I was tethered directly to the system, minus the annoying wires.

**Noise-Canceling Microphone**  
Whether I was coordinating strategies in a Call of Duty Warzone match or hopping on a group Zoom call, the detachable ClearCast noise-canceling microphone performed admirably. Discord-certified with good reason, it captured my voice with clarity, filtering out background distractions like my roommate making coffee. The detachable feature is something I didn’t think I’d care much about, but I found myself removing it when simply binge-watching shows.

**Good Aspects**  
- The versatility across multiple gaming consoles and platforms.  
- Low-latency wireless connection ensures no audio lag.  
- Adjustable headband and breathable ear cushions for extended comfort.  
- Noise-canceling microphone works extremely well.  

**Caveats**  
- While the USB-C dongle is compact, it’s easy to misplace.  
- Slightly bulky for users looking for ultra-light headsets.  

**Market Rivals**  
I’ve used the Razer Barracuda X headset and Turtle Beach Stealth 700 for similar purposes, so direct comparisons came naturally. The Barracuda X boasts a lightweight design but falls just short of the SteelSeries Arctis 1 in terms of audio fidelity. Turtle Beach’s Stealth 700 offers dual connectivity between Bluetooth and game audio, which is something lacking here, but it’s bulkier and more expensive for what you’re getting. SteelSeries seems like a happy medium with balanced pricing and excellent performance. The USB-C dongle gives it a major edge when moving between devices—an area where these competitors lag significantly.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For someone who appreciates quality without breaking the bank, this headset feels like smart spending. While there are pricier options offering higher-end features, the SteelSeries Arctis 1 balances affordability with robust tech exceptionally well. If you’re looking for dependable audio performance, cross-platform versatility, and all-day comfort, you’ll likely feel it’s worth every penny.

1mibgxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mibgxt/ro_rayne_part_2/,[RO] Rayne Part 2,"Going home was easier this time, knowing that Melody considered me a friend. I still didn’t understand why she had left so suddenly the first time, or why she had seemed so cold and distant ever since. The sudden change was even more dramatic and confusing, but all I really cared about was that she wanted to see me again. 



Usually I hate phones. If it wasn’t for my work as a writer, I wouldn’t have even owned one. The need to keep in contact with my publisher was the only reason I didn’t happily drown the thing in the ocean. Well, it used to be the only reason. For the first time in my life, I was happy to add a number to my contact list. When she finally answered, I almost ran to my desk, my cane tapping madly on my hardwood floor.

  


Up for tomorrow?  Text your address, I’ll pick you up.   -  M

  


I settled down on my couch and typed my answer. It had been a long time since I’d used my phone for more than an occasional call and my thumbs felt enormous and clumsy as I finally pressed send. The moon was on its way up and I decided to forgo my laptop and the editing that was still begging to be done. My property stretched down to the water’s edge, sloping in from a rocky point that I shared with my neighbors, into a wide, pebbled cove behind my garage. I’d made a small camping area in the trees above the waterline, lit at night by dozens of solar lamps. The fire pit hadn’t seen a fire in ages, but I remembered everything I had learned at camp and soon had a small blaze flickering in the darkness.



In spite of the lack of sleep from the night before, my weariness had vanished. I hadn’t planned on writing anything, but brought a notebook out of sheer habit. Before I knew it, words were pouring out onto the page, a story of magic and heroes inspired by my talk with Melody. I didn’t know if it would turn into anything real, but the seed was there and it felt good to be writing again instead of editing. I’m not sure when I finally went to bed, but I woke up the next morning safe in my bed. It was still early and I wandered out to the kitchen. I had eggs and bacon in a frying pan when there was a knock at the door.



“Too early?” Melody asked as I opened the door. She was leaning on the railing, dressed in simple jeans and a black, long sleeved shirt that made her purple eyes shine. A faded green jacket was draped over her arm. I could see a small silver car parked near my truck.



“Uh no,” I said, swallowing my surprise. “I was just making breakfast, do you want some?”



She followed me into the kitchen, looking around in interest as I hurried over to the stove to check on the food.



“Do you want scrambled eggs or fried?” I asked as she sat down. “And how much bacon would you like?”



“Whatever you feel like making,” she said, turning her chair to look out through the open living room to the great picture windows. “I love your view.” Her eyes lit up as she noticed my extensive library. They grew brighter when they fell on the swords hanging in the empty spaces between shelves. “Wow… you have a pretty nice collection here yourself Barnabas.”



I smiled as I filled a plate and put it on the table beside her. “I have playing cards too, but they don’t display quite as well as weapons.” She tore her eyes away and watched me as I broke more eggs and added more bacon to the pan. “I got my first sword after I published my first short story. It kind of became a tradition… I sell a story and treat myself to a cool weapon. Probably not the smartest system ever, but I’ve been doing it for years.”



“Just make sure you don’t leave candles too close to the curtains,” Melody warned, half joking. She gasped and then laughed as Clue padded out of my bedroom and hopped up into her lap, purring loudly. “Who’s this then?”



“I call him Clue,” I replied, finishing up my own breakfast. “I helped my dad take his dog to the vet a few years ago and this monster decided he wanted to come home with us. Hard to believe he was a kitten once.” 



“He’s a beauty,” she crooned, scratching his ears. “A big, beautiful softy.”



“He likes you,” I observed, strangely pleased that my pet approved of my guest. “He usually hides from strangers.”



“They can tell when people like them,” Melody said, reaching over the now snoozing cat to taste her breakfast. “If I didn’t have a house that needed water, I might have gotten a cat.”



We ate quietly, each enjoying the other’s company as we watched the boat traffic passing by outside.



Finally, Melody pushed her plate aside. “Ready to go? We should leave soon if you want to get to Portland in time.”



“Really? Portland’s only an hour or so away.”



I put the plates in the dishwasher and slipped into my shoes, only to stop as I felt her eyes on the back of my head. When I looked back she was smiling. 



“I thought we’d do something a little different,” she said. “Come on.”



I followed her out to her car, limping only a little. She laughed off my questions and sang along with the radio, flashing her eyes at me until I gave up and decided to enjoy the ride. To my surprise we passed by the road leading to the highway and went into town, parking in a small lot by one of the harbor’s many piers.



“Here she is,” Melody said proudly as she got out and leaned on the hood. “The Light of Dawn. My home.”



I followed her down the ramp to the mid sized tugboat that was her house. “This… this is incredible! What made you name her this?”



“Just a thought I had one morning,” she said as untied the mooring lines. “Come on, let’s get out of here!”



\*



I was no stranger to boats, but it was the first time I’d ever been on a tugboat, much less with a woman like Melody. The day was bright and clear, with only a handful of great, fluffy white clouds. Somewhere between the kitchen table and my door, Melody had discovered my sunglasses and brought them along, producing them from her pocket with a grin as we climbed into the pilot house. She was obviously familiar with the route and her melodious voice filled the cabin as she showed me the controls.



It was quiet for a while as we reached the open ocean beyond the islands. Melody hummed quietly to herself, her eyes somehow even more brilliant in the morning sunlight as it reflected off of the waters.



“Have any family Barnabas?” she asked suddenly. “I didn’t see any pictures at your house.”



“My mom died when I was little,” I replied. “I don’t really remember her though. My father passed away a couple of years ago. I might have some cousins out west, but I don’t have any family I’m close to any more.”



Melody lost her bright smile. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bring up bad memories.”

  


“No bad memories,” I reassured. “My dad had a good life until he got sick, and now he’s in a better place.” I watched as she looked back out to sea. “How ‘bout you?”



She shrugged. “I’m an orphan actually… I don’t remember anything but the orphanage. I’m told my dad was a soldier. A hero. ” 



“Oh….”



“It’s alright Barnabas,” she said quickly. “I asked first.” My heart swelled in my chest as she reached over and touched my arm. “You’re a good friend.” Her eyes sparkled. “We orphans should stick together.”



“Thanks Melody,” I said gratefully, emboldened by her response. “I don’t have many friends.”



She cocked her head in apparent confusion. “I don’t see why not. You’re a great guy. I don’t think I could stop liking you, even if I wanted to.”



My breath left my chest in a helpless laugh. “I don’t know about that.”



A frown marred her happy face and she did something with the controls before spinning her chair to face me. She wrapped her slender arms around her stomach, suddenly seeming sad and vulnerable. “Barnabas… why would you think that?”



“I… I don’t know,” I said, looking away. “You’re this perfect, wonderful person and I’m… I’m broken and weird and I already chased you away once.” My breath hitched and felt a knot growing in my throat. “I’m just scared that I’ll do or say something stupid and make you leave again.”



“Oh Barnabas,” she whispered, her eyes growing dark and misty. “It’s not like that….” She sighed and stared down at her hands. “I liked you the instant I saw you. I was just afraid that I’d do something reckless.”



“Reckless?”



She ignored me. “That day in the coffee house, I thought I could handle myself, but when you asked me to go to dinner with you I panicked. It almost killed me when I realized that I had hurt you.” I could see the muscles on her arms tighten through her thin shirt as she hugged herself, as if trying to hold something back. “Then when you didn’t come to class yesterday I got so worried that I left early to look for you.” 



She snorted and looked out the window at the distant shoreline. “It seems crazy now, but I imagined that you had fallen and hurt your knee somewhere trying to get to campus. When I saw you sitting on your bench in the park, I realized that I would rather be reckless than lose the chance to be your friend.”



My mouth worked open and closed for several long moments as my brain struggled to process her subdued outburst. When my words finally came, they sounded strangled and hoarse. “I wouldn’t hurt you Melody…”



“You’re worried that you’d hurt me?” she asked incredulously. “I just told you that I’m pretty much a stalker and you’re worried about my feelings?” Her eyes narrowed and her voice suddenly sounded annoyed. “Wait. Why did you say you were broken?”



I started to babble, in shock from her sudden change in attitude. “I just mean that I’m not exactly very useful anymore. I used to be a gentleman, believe it or not.”



“Used to be?”



“Well yeah,” I said. “It’s hard to hold doors open for people, or pull out chairs, or do volunteer work when everyone is faster than you and doesn’t need a cane to get around.”



“You’re an incredible person Barnabas,” Melody insisted. She got up and walked over to me. I had always been a big man, hovering just under six feet tall. Melody was nearly half a foot shorter than me, but somehow as she stood over me now, I felt small, like I was looking up into the eyes of a giant. “You have a good heart, I can sense it. Besides, you've helped more people than anyone else I’ve met, and you didn’t need to use your legs to do it.”



I was stunned. “It doesn’t feel like much… I can’t help the people around me as much any more….”



“That’s sweet,” she said. “Stupid, but sweet.” Her eyes flashed and her smile turned wicked. “But if you ever say that you’re useless again, I’m going to steal your cane and hide it until you admit that it isn’t a bad thing to have a disability.”



She squeezed my shoulder and walked back to her chair, and the strange sensation of being dwarfed faded away.



“I don’t think you’re reckless,” I said, almost drunk from her eyes and the sound of her voice. “Or a stalker. I think you’re just passionate… you don’t do anything halfway.”



“That’s been said about me,” she said, throwing me an odd look. “We’re almost there, you ready?”



We didn’t say much after that. Melody was too busy bringing the tug through the shipping traffic and into a slip she obviously knew well, though she chatted aimlessly as we went, telling me stories about her first voyage from Florida to Maine. I helped her tie the boat off and she led me up the street into the heart of the city. 



“I think I owe you a dinner,” she said as we turned a corner. “Isn’t that right?”



“I don’t know about that,” I said, stuffing my hands into my pockets. “I thought you just wanted to go to a bookstore.”



She slipped around to stand in front of me, her purple eyes shining with mischief. “I think I’ll make you take me to lunch before I show you the bookstore.” One perfect eyebrow lifted. “How does that sound?”



For a moment I felt a flash of panic as I tried to remember if I had remembered to take my wallet from my nightstand. I breathed a sigh of relief as I felt the smooth leather in my pocket. “I think I can do that. Where do you want to go?”



She turned around and started to reply, only to freeze in her tracks when she saw a man walking down the street in front of us.



“Blood Court?” he asked, stopping a few yards away. I felt a chill as his dark eyes flickered past Melody to look at me. “And a pet?”



“Get behind me Barnabas,” Melody said. Her words were soft, but laced with a power that had my legs moving by themselves. I hadn’t paid the man much attention before, but now I took a closer look, wondering what could have possibly made Melody so wary.



He seemed average to my eyes, tallish and pale, almost sickly. He was dressed in a rumpled suit and there were dark circles under his eyes as if he hadn’t slept in days. His eyes caught me though, in a much different way than Melody’s. They were dark, almost black, with a touch of red that seemed to shine in the shadows of the towering buildings.



“What brings you here, down out of your high castle?” he asked, his voice mocking. “Want to be seen among the peasants?”



“What do you want leech?” asked Melody, her eyes flashing with anger.



The man clapped his hand to his heart, his eyes wide with what he must have assumed was a hurt expression. To me, it looked like a child playing pretend. 



“You wound me, oh lady of shadows,” he hissed. “But I believe there’s an expression… something about pots and kettles?” He looked at me again. “And what about this one? Any big plans?”



Melody growled. Growled. I could feel it, seeming to make the ground under my feet shiver, a sound utterly alien coming from deep within her slender frame. The strange man took a step back, his face growing tight and angry.



“You can’t compel me forever Blood Court,” he snarled as he backed away. “I know your face. I have your scent!”



I blinked and he was gone. Melody spun around and grabbed me around the waist, lifting me like I could lift a baby. I felt a rush of wind and motion and we were back on the boat. An instant later it was untied and we were adrift. I started climb back up to the pilot house only to have her seize my hand with impossible strength and lift me into the room. She helped me over to the second chair and took the wheel without looking at me. 



“I’m sorry Barnabas,” she said, her voice so soft that I had to strain to hear it. “I didn’t want you to have to know this.”



I tried to move, to talk, to say anything, but my body stubbornly refused to listen to my head.



“It’s all true, everything that you wished for,” she said as she took the boat out into the open harbor. She looked at me, her face drawn and weary. Her purple eyes flickered up to my chest and then away, as if she was afraid to see the look on my face. My heart broke as her face twisted with pain and tears pooled in the corners of her eyes. “Every wonderful, beautiful, terrible, and evil thing you can imagine.”



“What was he?” I gasped, finding my voice at last. “That guy….”



Melody watched me, all traces of happiness gone from her face. “Would you believe me if I told you?” she wondered, talking more to herself than to me. She covered her face with her hands. “And you thought that you would be the one sending me running from the room screaming.”



“Even if I wanted to run I couldn’t,” I quipped, regaining a bit of my courage. “I’m lame and we’re on a boat.”



Her shoulders shook and she choked out what might have been a laugh. Her violet eyes met mine for the first time, regaining just a hint of a smile. “I’m about to tell you that vampires are real and you’re making jokes?”



I shrugged, momentarily stuck without a response. She turned back to the controls and there was quiet for a long time.



“He called you blood court,” I said softly. A small part of me dreaded the answer to my question. I squashed it with memories of the joy and life that I’d seen in Melody’s eyes only hours earlier. “Does that mean you’re….”



She didn’t move for several long moments. At last, she pulled back the throttle and pushed a button on the dash. I heard the sound of something heavy hitting the water and guessed that she’d dropped anchor.



“Come with me,” she said. “There’s something that you should see.”



I followed her down the stairs to the main deck and then into the hold. I took in only a little, a small, simply furnished living room, filled with books and a handful of weapons and artifacts. There was a kitchen near the bow and when I looked back I saw a door that must have led to her bedroom. I hesitated by a battered couch as she went to the refrigerator and threw open the door. My stomach twisted when I saw bags of blood stacked neatly beside groceries and leftovers.



“There are two kinds of vampires,” she started, picking up a bag and looking at it with loathing. “Two different species. The Blood Court and the Bone Court. We’ve been at war for years…” Her lip twisted in scorn. “They call us usurpers.” Her eyes darkened. “Even though the Blood Court is older and the Bones aren’t true supernaturals.”



She groaned and put the blood back, slamming the door as she huddled up against the wall. “Not that I’m proud to be a part of all this.”



“So you are a….”



“Not quite, but close enough,” she interrupted. “Yet for all intents and purposes I’m a member of the Blood Court. A monster.”



I limped across the room to stand in front of her. “I don’t think you’re a monster.” She stiffened as I took her hand. “You just said you weren’t a vampire.”



Her purple eyes flickered to mine for an instant and then flickered away. “I’m worse.”



“I don’t believe that,” I insisted, squeezing her hands. I looked around helplessly. “I can’t.”



“I just showed you a refrigerator full of blood and you don’t think I’m a monster?” Melody asked, her eyes wide. “I could want to suck your blood!”



“Do you?”



“No!” she said, almost crying. “No. I’d never hurt you!”



“Then why do you think you’re a monster?” I pressed, sinking to my knees so I could look up into her face. “You’re still the most amazing person I’ve ever met.”



My knee twisted beneath me, sending a jolt of pain up my leg. Melody gasped and lifted me to my feet, holding me steady as she helped me to the couch.



“Your knee,” she said, perching beside me. “Are you okay?”



“Yeah, I just moved it wrong.” I rubbed the aching joint and forced a smile. “If you aren’t actually a vampire, then what are you?”



“Barnabas, please,” she pleaded, still close to tears. “Just let me pretend to be human… just for a little while longer.”



I nodded helplessly and she left me on her couch with an ice pack for my knee and returned to the pilot house. Shock and my own lack of sleep mixed with the hum of the motor and the slow rocking of the boat to send me to sleep. Fear should have kept me wide awake, but even knowing that Melody had a blood filled refrigerator, part of me knew that I was the safest I had ever been. I started to dream and she was there in the dream with me, smiling, as happy as she had been this morning. The other man, the vampire she had chased away, lurked in the background, warned away by a growl that shook the earth.



I woke up with a gasp, half expecting the vampire from the city to be standing over me. The room was empty and dark and the boat was still, the engine quiet. The only light came from the flickering stars outside the small porthole windows. It had gotten colder, but I had been covered with a small mountain of soft blankets. I shifted slightly and suddenly Melody was standing over me, her purple eyes shining in the dark. She smiled gently and stroked my hair, tucking the blankets in around me. 



“Sleep,” she whispered, her voice like a lullaby. “It’s the middle of the night. Rest Barnabas, you’re safe here.”



And sleep I did.



\*



When I opened my eyes again, sunlight was streaming through the windows and I sat up with a start. Melody was standing in the kitchen, bent over her tiny stove.



“Now that it’s out in the open, I have no idea what regular humans like for breakfast,” she said, offering me a dazzling smile. “I didn’t have any bacon or eggs, so I’m making steak.” She spun around and slipped over to my side, her movements seeming even more graceful than usual as she helped me to my feet and handed me my cane.



“Where are we?” I asked as I sat down at the table. 



“Back in town,” she replied as she flipped the steaks in the pan, searing the meat with a practiced hand. “We got here last night while  you were sleeping.” She offered me a fond look. “You looked so peaceful that I didn’t want to wake you up.”



I rubbed my bleary eyes, wishing fervently for coffee. Almost as if she had read my mind, Melody turned away from the stove and grabbed a mug from a cabinet. She flipped a switch on an ancient coffee maker and soon the boat smelled like Starbucks. I watched as she finished the steaks and monitored the coffee, entranced by her inhuman speed and dexterity.



“Is this what you are always like when people aren’t around?” I asked in awe as she plated the finished steaks and put them on the table, moving so quickly that her hands were a blur. “It’s amazing.”



She smiled and picked up the coffee pot. I blinked and then she was sitting in the chair next to me, pouring me a mug. “Usually. I’ve had a lot of practice toning it down when I’m around people.” Her smile faded and she swallowed uncertainly. “I can stop if you want me to.”



I shook my head and her grin nearly split her face in half.



“Is there anything that I need to know?” I asked as she started to eat. “I mean, is it like in the books? Are you in danger because I know?”



She chuckled. “No. Most of the Courts already have deals with human governments. They get riches and favors and we get left alone.” Her spoon clinked on her mug as she stirred her coffee, her violet eyes staring at nothing. “I… I guess you have questions. You have to.”



I shrugged, taking a slow bite of my steak as my addled mind tried to sort through a thousand curiosities and more than a few fears. As I watched her eat, I decided on one of the easiest. “So vampires and… well you, drink blood right? But I’ve seen you eat real food and drink the same things I like to drink. So are all vampires like that or is it because you are different.”



“I’m a Blood Court vampire. Part of the original Vampire clan,” she said. Her voice was steady and there was a smile on her face, but I could sense the tension beneath her words. “We eat regular food, but need blood as a supplement. Kind of like insulin for a diabetic.” Seemingly satisfied with the amount of sugar and cream in her coffee, she lifted it to her lips, impervious to the still scalding heat. “Vampires from the Court of Bones are true undead and can’t eat anything but blood.” 



“Are there any more, besides vampires and whatever you are?”



She sighed and set down her cup and pushed away her half eaten food, her appetite gone. “Barnabas… make sure you want to know. Once I show you my world, I can’t give you yours back.” Her voice shook only slightly. “It’s not too late to turn back.”



“I don’t want to turn back,” I said, my throat constricting. “I know I haven’t known you very long Melody, but you’re already the best friend I’ve ever had. I don’t want to lose you.”



Her eyes widened and she gave a strangled laugh. “Barnabas, I don’t know whether to cry or yell at you. You’re supposed to be afraid of me. You should be afraid of me…” She sniffled and took a deep breath. “But I’m glad that you aren’t.”



I gathered my courage and reached over the table to touch her hand. “Were you afraid you’d hurt me?” I asked softly. “That first day in the coffee house. Because you’re a vampire?”

  


“No,” she said, shaking her head as she hunched over the table.. Her dark hair was loose today and danced in feathery waves around her shoulders. She was so close that I could smell her untidy locks, the scent of apple blossoms turning my mind blank. I shook myself and blew on my coffee as she continued. “That’s my other half….”



“I don’t understand.”



My heart palpitated as she went still. 



“I should have known you would ask the two questions that could ruin your life,” she said softly. Her eyes met mine. “You put yourself at a crossroads and you didn’t even know it.”



The indefinable power I’d felt before returned, and even though Melody never moved, she grew in my eyes until she seemed to fill the room. “You’re my friend Barnabas, and you always will be.”



I swallowed nervously. “Wh… what are you saying?”



“I was afraid because when my kind takes, we don’t give back,” she said. I felt her hand tighten beneath mine, pressing down on the table. “When you looked at me, what did you see?”



“Fire,” I said, the word ripping out of my throat almost by itself. “And your eyes.”



“I saw it too,” she said. “Long and short, you suddenly became the most important person in the world to me. I thought I could ignore it, wait until the feeling went away.” She laughed and shook her head. “But you can see how that worked out.”



Her hand slipped out from under mine and she stood, padding back and forth as the power faded away. “You wanted love at first sight. You thought it was a good thing, something magical and wonderful.” She looked at me and the fires returned again as I fell headlong into her shining gaze. “Maybe it is. But if I act on it, I would consume you. You would never have a normal life, never raise a family or grow old with me. How could I possibly ask you to give that up?”



She moaned miserably and sat back down as I nearly fell out of my chair, drunk from the heat in my skull. “See? All I have to do is look at you with my true eyes and I melt your brain.”



“No!” I gasped, forcing my thoughts back to coherency. “It’s just a little overwhelming.” I forced a smile. “That wasn’t nearly as bad as the first time.”



“You’re a strange man Barnabas,” she said, looking at me through her curtain of hair. “This is your last chance to turn back. I’ll be your friend, or I can be something more.” She straightened and I saw her throat working uneasily. “I will do whatever you decide. Just make sure you’re okay with the consequences.”



“It won’t… hurt will it?” I asked, suddenly wishing for the thrill of the fire again. 



Melody stared at me in shock. “What? No! No, it would just mean that you’re stuck with me and everything I am.” She leaned closer, her incredible eyes wide and almost fearful. “For the rest of your life and beyond. Me, no one else, ever.”



I gulped and began to stammer. “Is… isn’t that the way it’s supposed to be? I mean, that’s what I’ve always wanted anyway.”



Melody’s eyes went wide and suddenly I was in her arms, lifted into the air by a woman who couldn’t have weighed much more than a hundred pounds. She spun me around once and set me back on my feet, standing on her toes to plant a kiss on my cheek. Her smile turned playful and mischievous. “You’re mine now Barnabas Rayne. I hope you’re ready.”



 When I asked more questions, Melody flat out refused to answer. Instead, she led me out to her car, saying something about needing a break. 



“You have me forever Barnabas,” she said with a happy smile as we drove away. “Just be a little patient. Trust me, there’s too much to take in in one day.”



I relented and leaned back in my seat, watching her from the corner of my eye as she sang softly along with the radio. Secretly I thought that the radio just got in the way. My mind was still reeling from the shock of the last day and a half, but I knew without a doubt that her voice was the most beautiful thing I’d ever heard in my life. A small part of the back of my mind realized that she definitely wasn’t human, but I realized I didn’t care. Even if she was a vampire, or something like a vampire, she was still the most amazing person I’d ever met.

1mibgx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1mibgx1/histamine_and_phase_ll_detox_pathways/,Histamine and Phase ll detox pathways,"I have struggled with allergies and inflammation since I was a child and developed rosacea with my first period. As a 51 year old, and 50 pounds overweight, I am just now figuring out how to heal. Between this forum and Chat GPT guiding me, since doctors don't have time to figure this out, I will share what I've learned. 

I have MCAS. I am on Singulair and eat a low histamine, low sulfur and low Fodmap diet. I've stopped regular coffee and now take a caffeine pill in the mornings instead. I can have a cleanly produced Swiss-water decaf (Kicking Horse) for my cravings (low sulfur, mold).  

I cannot tolerate H1 antihistmines (Allegra, Claritin etc) I take an H2 antihistamine, famotidine (Pepcid), for the occasional food relief, which calms those gut mast cells from releasing histamines.  

My sister told me I needed to detox to get everything out. I told her I have tried in the past and it creates really bad flares and it hurts so much I can't walk. She said It sounds like something is blocking my detox. I bounced all this information off of Chat GPT and took the molybdenum recommendation someone else here gave. 

I have been on a micro dose (1/4 tsp) of molybdenum for a week. Started every other day, upped hydration, and am now every day. Started liquid iron (no cellulose), per my doctor's lab results and i feel so normal now and I've lost 3 pounds (water). I've always known I was anemic.

The molybdenum apparently opens up your Phase ll detox pathways to remove the bottleneck blockage so your Phase l detox can work more efficiently. It also helps your body process sulfur so you don't react to high sulfur foods. I may not actually have the legume allergy I tested possitive for. My inviornmental allergies have also improved in just one week. My gut no longer swells after I eat.

I hope to help others understand, and not everyone is the same, that a lot of our ""allergies"" may just be bottled up detox symptoms.  I am actually excited for my next allergist appointment to share with her what I've discovered and accomplished.  Maybe she can help other patients.  Work with your doctor to make sure you don't have any mineral or vitamin deficiencies too. Mine was iron and Vitamin B-12.",5,1754405808.0,HistamineIntolerance,4,1.0,False

We let the internet blight our world.  It’s not often talked about but we went online and let blight the places we socially interact and take dates.

What collapsed in my area?

The mall.  I hail from the land of Stranger Things.  We are the mall.  It was created around me.  I took my first toddler steps at the mall.  They are gone. What remains are ghost towns. 

The bowling alley.  Everyone’s favorite after work ritual - gone.  Place for teens - gone. Perennial easy date night - gone

Local theatre.  The place was a marvel of teenage footsie and first make outs.  In some ways we were in a 300 capacity teen cuddle every weekend.  It’s gone. It desperately tries to sell boats now. 


Underground coffee shops.  My college years wouldn’t be the same had they not been served with coffee, walls of artist graffiti paintings, mosaic toilet thrones and vegan pamphlets.  I explored the ideas of philosophy, games, lgbt, polyamory and more over black coffee so dank it grows hair on your chins. One word - Starbucks


Cruisin spots.  What was summer if not long nights of lovers & friends sitting on tops of their car hoods watching the world go by.  Replaced by online spats full of misunderstandings.


The beaches.  Close to empty.  What was once ceremonies of starlight skinny dipping and grand central station for families & lovers is now just goose poop. 


Skate park.  You dear thing full of memories of Vans & Operation Ivy.  Comatose. Flat concrete now.


Town festival square.  Gone. Some Green Party folks turned it into a green space.  They did such because everyone was too busy online to come to town meeting to stop them. 


Kids biking.  We used to roam from sun up to sundown.  Jumping of docks into lakes wasn’t something we liked on TikTok, it was something we did.  We had forts. We explored water towers.  We moved in solidarity with our ride or dies.  Now seeing anyone on a bike is seeing an anomaly.  A strange blast from the past … that doesn’t last.  


These are the casualties of the World Wide Web.  I could continue but the task got too grim.  What will be the casualties of ai?

#### Cuisinart 12 Cup Coffee Percolator
- **Material:** Stainless steel construction

I walked from Oloron-Sainte-Marie to Puente la Reina in early June 2025, and since I had struggled to find clear, up-to-date information before my trip — especially after the severe floods that hit the Aspe Valley in September 2024 — I thought I’d share a detailed update on trail conditions and logistics for others planning to walk the Camino Aragonés.

If you want to follow along easily, I suggest checking [hiking.waymarkedtrails.org](https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/) and downloading the schedule for **Bus 550** (Nouvelle-Aquitaine public transport), which runs between Oloron and Canfranc.

# My Stages (following Gronze's breakdown):

* **Day 1:** Oloron-Sainte-Marie → Sarrance (20.6 km)
* **Day 2:** Sarrance → Etsaut/Borce (22.4 km)
* **Day 3:** Etsaut/Borce → Somport (17 km – with 4.6 km by bus)

# Day 1: Oloron to Sarrance

A pretty easy day overall. The trail was muddy through the forested section between Oloron and Eysus, so expect dirty shoes if it's been rainy.

There’s one nice place to stop — *La Légende de Pyrène* in Escot — where you can get coffee and crepes.

In Sarrance, we stayed at **Hôtel-Restaurant Les Pas Sages**, which offers a great value half-board deal (€42 per person with a private room). Highly recommend! The Monastery is still the main pilgrim option, but if you're looking for comfort and good food, Les Pas Sages is a great pick.

# Day 2: Sarrance to Etsaut/Borce

A beautiful day of walking, especially the first half. Just after leaving Sarrance, you’ll pass some lovely swimming spots (perfect if the weather’s warm!). There are services in **Bedous** and **Accous**, including a grocery store.

From **Accous** onwards, things get trickier. After a scenic first half before Accous, the second half involves walking along or near the **N134**, which has minimal shoulder space and traffic. You’ll soon encounter fences and signs closing off the official trail due to rockslides and damage from the 2024 storms.

These trails aren’t dangerous, but they are barely used — tall grass and some tricky navigation slow you down. It’s doable, but to be honest, I wouldn’t choose this section again.

The first fence is at Eygun-Lescun hydroelectric power station and the second fence is at Cette-Eygun where you can take a bridge to cross the river and go back on the N134 if you have enough...

# Day 3: Etsaut/Borce to Somport

This is the “queen stage” — the big mountain day — and like most pilgrims, we took **Bus 550** (cash only!) from Etsaut to **Urdos**, skipping the dangerous and uninspiring road walk to the Fort du Portalet. (If you’re a purist, you can take the GR10 to avoid the road, but keep your energy for later...)

From **Urdos**, the trail is gorgeous and splits into two parts:

1. **Urdos to Fouillassar**: lovely views, good trail.
2. **Fouillassar to Somport**: the ascent is steady and very well maintained, as it lies within a national park.

There’s one overgrown section near **Fouillassar** (an abandoned sheep farm), but otherwise everything is in excellent condition. Services are only available in **Urdos** and at the **Somport pass**, so plan accordingly.

💡 **Tip:** If you only want to do the mountain climb, ask the bus driver to drop you off at **Forges d’Abel**, right before the ascent.

# Recommended Itinerary (to avoid road + closed trails)

If you want to avoid unpleasant sections, here’s a cleaner alternative:

* **Day 1:** Oloron → Sarrance
* **Day 2:** Sarrance → Accous, then **bus to Urdos**
* **Day 3:** Urdos → Somport (or Candanchú)

The bus gives you flexibility — you can sleep in various towns and hop on again the next morning. Sleeping in **Urdos**, however, gives you freedom to start the climb early.

# ""Express Version""

If you're short on time, just hike the final stage! Bus 550 connects **Oloron/Bedous** (France) and **Canfranc** (Spain), so you can start walking from **Urdos** or **Forges d’Abel** and begin your Camino Aragonés from there.

# From Somport to Puente la Reina

* Gronze suggests doing **Somport to Jaca (30 km)** in one day. I recommend stopping halfway in **Canfranc** — it’s scenic and the *donativo* albergue is excellent.
* Walking in **June** was tougher than expected: **very little shade** along most of the route, so prepare for heat and sun exposure.

# Final Thoughts

The **Camino Aragonés** is a fantastic option if you’ve already walked the Camino Francés from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and want to try a scenic and quieter alternative. It offers a different perspective of the Pyrenees and you have a lot to see along the way.",3,1754405569.0,CaminoDeSantiago,0,1.0,False

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_LOIS LANE WRITING SAMPLE\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was a certain strength in getting out of bed every morning. The mattress and pillow that someone claimed was special - a place of pure unmitigated vulnerability that every soul returned to night after night. Staying in such a familiar place was easy - bearing the responsibilities that would surely follow, took *power* to repeat day after day. Of course, there were countless people who do not always find themselves asleep in *bed*. Workstations, vehicles, the couch - all equally important and still just as required to ensure the human body could rest and recover enough to *ensure* they still had enough life to power through the next cycle. 

The morning sun peeked in through draped windows. Sparse beams of light shone in through the glass panes, spotlighting the disheveled home; pens, dirty mugs, papers, stacks of empty takeout boxes that matched the height of dog-eared stacked books. A tornado of discovery had destroyed the apartment and the pristine, emptied trashcan tucked neatly into the corner of the kitchen near the fridge signaled that no attempts to repair the damage had been made. Beneath the mess, however, was a home of stories; more stories had been told from the aged office chair than full, uninterrupted nights of sleep had been enjoyed. 

The very same office chair was currently occupied; sleep had *finally* wrapped its arms around Lois Lane, pulling her into much needed slumber. It had been a *very* long week. The Justice League did what they usually did: Stopped a world-ending threat, caused billions of dollars worth of property damage, honored in a parade - none of those stories were world changing publishings. Everyone had read them and everyone knew that safety would be coming, no matter the problem: Superman would come and save the day. But Superman couldn’t be everywhere at once. Every superhero in the *universe* could clock in at 00:01 and work until 23:59 and there would still be portions of the world that needed help - that couldn’t accept the help of the heroes the rest of the world relied on. *That* was where Lois Lane found purpose. She used her daily strength to direct her attention to the pockets of dark in the world that *needed* to be brought to light. It’s why she hadn’t been sleeping or keeping up with her apartment’s cleanliness. She simply had too important of a job to accomplish. 

The conflict in Bialya and Qurac was getting out of control - Queen Bee of Bialya made a public condemnation of the United States of America for providing military and financial aid to the nation of Qurac despite their troubled history. Qurac’s attack on Metropolis shook the nation and *Jihad*, their secret black-ops meta-human terrorist-for-hire sect, only escalated tensions between the two military powers further. Mentions of Benjamin Turner (The Bronze Tiger), George “Digger” Harkness (Captain Boomerang), Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), June Moone (Enchantress) and assorted other known, incarcerated supervillains could be found all over the internet on Quraci news sites - all around the time that Jihad’s power was wiped off the face of the Earth. It was obvious there was outside interference from the United States. 

Qurac as a nation had struggled in recent years as a result of the nuclear bomb that exploded over the airspace - another action committed by a supervillain - and as such, had been forced to rely on imports from other countries for basis necessities such as food, oil, clean water - but none of that made any sense to Lois. As far as she could see, there was no reason for the conflict to continue. Land, sure, but the concept of fighting over irradiated dirt was lost on her. Before the coffee-brewed coffee she’d been drinking like water failed her, she was deep into her search for *something* that could point her in the right direction - the missing puzzle piece to make the picture finally *click*. 

The morning light continued to seep into the apartment. Dossiers, banking records, steno-sized notepads, and multicolored sticky notes that littered tables, counters and chairs of the home finally stood out amongst the shadows of the home. The sticky notes had meaning: blue for ideas, pink for tangents, yellow for reminders, orange for facts. Every cluster of paper had an equal amount of facts. Every fact had thrice as many tangents. For every tangent, there were four ideas and for every idea there were two reminders. The system was flawed, sure, but that didn’t mean it was inefficient. There was a certain flow that directed them up towards the walls. Amongst the notes were pictures of a life. Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles. History had a way of sprinkling reminders throughout time - it was only a part of the human experience to try to remember. It brought so much *joy* to Lois that she could have a hand in creating reminders. 

As the morning’s touch lit up more and more of the apartment, the details of the pages scattered throughout lost their secrets. Given the bad blood between Qurac and The United States in past years, Lois knew there had to be more behind the decision to support them in conflict, rather than maintain neutrality. It wasn’t even the *first* time that the Bialya and Qurac were at war with one another, which The United States had flawlessly avoided without so much as a press statement. There was something going on underneath the surface and Lois *had* to be the one to uncover it. If  she didn’t? It never would. She had her colleagues, but they were happy with something smaller - as many front pages as possible to raise the recognition, raise the rewards and raise the morale of the nation when it needed it most. 

So *why?* Why *Bialya?* Why *Qurac?* That was the burning question that inspired a phone call at 02:23 in the morning to one of her few contacts on that side of the world. Lois paced around her apartment, effortlessly gliding around the mess and wreckage while she continued to fight for knowledge. Lois never had the *best* Arabic, so getting information while on the brink of physical collapse was *taxing* on her mind, to say the very least; Confusion, frustration, insults and apologies were hurled through the cell phone as if they were bullets - some landed, some grazed and some missed so wide that someone else caught the stray, but she got a single lead: The Quraci Military *found* something two-hundred-fifty kilometers off of the coast, in contested waters. The call dropped and Lois was left to figure out what to do with the details she was given. 

It wasn’t impossible - all it was one snowball to barrel down the hill long enough to cause an avalanche. Lois ***yearned*** to shout from her lungs and shake the world, sending frozen white powder onto the unsuspecting minds of those who needed it most - the ones with a *voice*. The little voice in her mind was begging for her to get her eight hours in, but by the time the clock hit 03:30, she knew that sleep wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. That was when Lois began *seriously* taking notes; her printer had never seen so much action, shooting out transcripts, message logs, news reports and - most importantly expenditure accounts for all involved parties. It took a lot of digging - and that’s where the strain began to sneak in. Numbers began to blur into Times New Blobs as her vision faded in and out of focus. 

The morning light began to soak into the nooks and crannies of Lois Lane’s Fortress of Intellect. Smiling faces and moments of love could be seen all over the home. The shoes of a man who was busy doing his own part to save the world; The vase of violet tulips, lightly wilted but intensely cherished, on a slim entryway table near the front door; A magnet on the fridge consisting a photo of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, on the globe that rest atop the Daily Planet. The moments that were worth fighting for. There was no reason to fight - to *try* \- if there was nothing you could call sacred. Lois had that reason and would give every last ounce of her being to help someone else find theirs. 

Once, Qurac was known for having a wide resource of oil. It was thought to be lost after Cheshire’s nuclear strike on the nation, but recent reports suggest the opposite. A closer look into the energy expenditures account for the United States left a glaring two billion dollar hole where it shouldn’t have been. The financial backing of Qurac *did* have to originate from somewhere - as much as America brags about being the best, they still hadn’t generated the ability to make something out of nothing. 

The only issue with the budget was the source. There exists funds in the treasury *specifically* for aid in foreign affairs - so *why* ***energy?*** Simple. The Quraci Government found something of interest two-hundred-fifty kilometers off the coast, in contested waters. It was sad, really, how often everything looped back to oil. Never food, water, art or any other resource that could further the development of mankind into a kinder, more aware society. No, it was an ancient and beautifully finite substance that caused as many wars as it powered machinery. 

It would make sense, really. Qurac once was *known* for their grip on the world’s oil supply, but was forced to surrender a most - if not all - of their government’s funds just to keep from going bankrupt. Enter the US: A country going through intensive reform after a tense few terms held by consecutive presidents. They could use a win like Lex Luthor could use a hair-loss treatment; funneling money towards the one country that used to sell more oil than any other would make sense *if* said country was able to locate an uncontaminated source. 

*That* was when everything shifted into full gear. Lois ran to the only item that could be called her weapon - it wasn’t a sword; pen and paper hadn’t been the go-to tool for women like Lois in years; no, she often likened her laptop to that of a cannon. Loud. Explosive. Little room for error. Most importantly, she only had *one shot*. Her findings of fact and conclusions were sharpened, despite the lack of energy driving Lois’ motions. 

The sound of typing keys echoed throughout the apartment as Lois did everything she could to make her thoughts seem like anything more than the ramblings of a madwoman. It could be done - did it need to be done right at that moment? ***Yes***. If Lois knew one thing, it was that the world could change in a matter of seconds. All it took was a single *moment* to alter the world in such a fashion that it was impossible to live in the world before it. She’d lived through those moments - she’d *caused* her own handful of those moments. The world was always in need of change. It was the part of every man and woman, both on and off Earth, to make their home better. 

That was Lois’ duty. 

As the night continued on, Lois felt as her body began to pull towards the ground with every keystroke. She was exhausted - she had to fight - she *needed* to persist, if only for the phone call she received at 05:11 from her contact out east. The news was enough to give a second wind: ***The Quraci Government*** ***did*** ***find oil.*** A massive, unsullied, thought to be undiscovered reservoir of crude oil was found four and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the ocean. Lois got to writing. Her hands were her brush and the weathered plastic, her canvas. With each press of a lettered button, she felt a surge of energy course through her bloodstream - she was ready to change the worl-- 

The light of the new morning fully enveloped the totality of the apartment. The sounds of Metropolis - engines, birds, distant chatter on the concrete walkways - began to push their way into the home. A stray beam of sun struck the unconscious reporter directly in the face, disturbing her much needed sleep. She stirred for a moment before realizing - she was fully dressed, shoes and all, in her desk chair. Lois bolted upright, lifting her face off of the Laptop keyboard. A two page long string of “kjlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll” bookended what was sure to be the most important publishing of her career ~~so far.~~ 

She laughed and deleted the results of working herself to the bone. She could probably benefit from reviewing her submission - sending it to Perry for his review. Instead? She rose from her seat and made her way towards the window, throwing the window up along its track. Lois cleared her throat and stuck her head out of the window. A smile beamed from ear to ear.

Context: I was working at an event for 2 days with a girl. We were basically together for 16 hours a day and got along pretty quickly. We laughed a lot during these days, suffered through our shift and all, we even watched a movie while we were working. When I saw how stressfull she was Igave her a neck massage which she was very thankfull for, I side huged her when she completely lost her patience against a co-worker. At the end of our shifts I ensured her to not carry the heavy bags, always opened the door and offered to carry her bags.

There were times when she was keep getting hitted on and she always looked for my attention and I tried to make her feel comfortable. She felt comfortable enough to dump her problems with our boss on me, and even talk about getting cheated on by his ex. I dont mean she feels the same way as me just because of the things I mentioned but she is a lovely, kind, caring person so maybe she was just happy to work with someone who isnt like those douchebags she usually works with.

So once the 2 day was coming to an end I told her (at the tram station where she dropped me of so I wouldnt walk for half an hour) how pretty, and what a cute caring person she is and I would love to get a tea or coffee with her (I started saying tea first because I knew she likes it). To response she didnt say no she just told me that “We will discuss it”. At that moment I thought she is saying no just in her extremely polite way so I didnt asked for her insta I just said “All right then have a safe drive home”.

We both know each others name and it really isnt hard to find either her or mine insta. Do I follow her private acc and see if she accepts it or do I leave it the way it is because she just felt like I am a friend at work and it was a clear rejection or she was just tired after a long week of work and couldnt be bothered?

P.S.: there is a very little % that I am going to be working at the same place as she works again, but she kinda takes the same route to her job as me but its very unlikely we will meet again by random",1,1754405302.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Qurac as a nation had struggled in recent years as a result of the nuclear bomb that exploded over the airspace - another action committed by a supervillain - and as such, had been forced to rely on imports from other countries for basis necessities such as food, oil, clean water - but none of that made any sense to Lois. As far as she could see, there was no reason for the conflict to continue. Land, sure, but the concept of fighting over irradiated dirt was lost on her. Before the coffee-brewed coffee she’d been drinking like water failed her, she was deep into her search for *something* that could point her in the right direction - the missing puzzle piece to make the picture finally *click*. 

The morning light continued to seep into the apartment. Dossiers, banking records, steno-sized notepads, and multicolored sticky notes that littered tables, counters and chairs of the home finally stood out amongst the shadows of the home. The sticky notes had meaning: blue for ideas, pink for tangents, yellow for reminders, orange for facts. Every cluster of paper had an equal amount of facts. Every fact had thrice as many tangents. For every tangent, there were four ideas and for every idea there were two reminders. The system was flawed, sure, but that didn’t mean it was inefficient. There was a certain flow that directed them up towards the walls. Amongst the notes were pictures of a life. Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles. History had a way of sprinkling reminders throughout time - it was only a part of the human experience to try to remember. It brought so much *joy* to Lois that she could have a hand in creating reminders. 

As the morning’s touch lit up more and more of the apartment, the details of the pages scattered throughout lost their secrets. Given the bad blood between Qurac and The United States in past years, Lois knew there had to be more behind the decision to support them in conflict, rather than maintain neutrality. It wasn’t even the *first* time that the Bialya and Qurac were at war with one another, which The United States had flawlessly avoided without so much as a press statement. There was something going on underneath the surface and Lois *had* to be the one to uncover it. If  she didn’t? It never would. She had her colleagues, but they were happy with something smaller - as many front pages as possible to raise the recognition, raise the rewards and raise the morale of the nation when it needed it most. 

So *why?* Why *Bialya?* Why *Qurac?* That was the burning question that inspired a phone call at 02:23 in the morning to one of her few contacts on that side of the world. Lois paced around her apartment, effortlessly gliding around the mess and wreckage while she continued to fight for knowledge. Lois never had the *best* Arabic, so getting information while on the brink of physical collapse was *taxing* on her mind, to say the very least; Confusion, frustration, insults and apologies were hurled through the cell phone as if they were bullets - some landed, some grazed and some missed so wide that someone else caught the stray, but she got a single lead: The Quraci Military *found* something two-hundred-fifty kilometers off of the coast, in contested waters. The call dropped and Lois was left to figure out what to do with the details she was given. 

It wasn’t impossible - all it was one snowball to barrel down the hill long enough to cause an avalanche. Lois ***yearned*** to shout from her lungs and shake the world, sending frozen white powder onto the unsuspecting minds of those who needed it most - the ones with a *voice*. The little voice in her mind was begging for her to get her eight hours in, but by the time the clock hit 03:30, she knew that sleep wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. That was when Lois began *seriously* taking notes; her printer had never seen so much action, shooting out transcripts, message logs, news reports and - most importantly expenditure accounts for all involved parties. It took a lot of digging - and that’s where the strain began to sneak in. Numbers began to blur into Times New Blobs as her vision faded in and out of focus. 

The morning light began to soak into the nooks and crannies of Lois Lane’s Fortress of Intellect. Smiling faces and moments of love could be seen all over the home. The shoes of a man who was busy doing his own part to save the world; The vase of violet tulips, lightly wilted but intensely cherished, on a slim entryway table near the front door; A magnet on the fridge consisting a photo of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, on the globe that rest atop the Daily Planet. The moments that were worth fighting for. There was no reason to fight - to *try* \- if there was nothing you could call sacred. Lois had that reason and would give every last ounce of her being to help someone else find theirs. 

Once, Qurac was known for having a wide resource of oil. It was thought to be lost after Cheshire’s nuclear strike on the nation, but recent reports suggest the opposite. A closer look into the energy expenditures account for the United States left a glaring two billion dollar hole where it shouldn’t have been. The financial backing of Qurac *did* have to originate from somewhere - as much as America brags about being the best, they still hadn’t generated the ability to make something out of nothing. 

The only issue with the budget was the source. There exists funds in the treasury *specifically* for aid in foreign affairs - so *why* ***energy?*** Simple. The Quraci Government found something of interest two-hundred-fifty kilometers off the coast, in contested waters. It was sad, really, how often everything looped back to oil. Never food, water, art or any other resource that could further the development of mankind into a kinder, more aware society. No, it was an ancient and beautifully finite substance that caused as many wars as it powered machinery. 

It would make sense, really. Qurac once was *known* for their grip on the world’s oil supply, but was forced to surrender a most - if not all - of their government’s funds just to keep from going bankrupt. Enter the US: A country going through intensive reform after a tense few terms held by consecutive presidents. They could use a win like Lex Luthor could use a hair-loss treatment; funneling money towards the one country that used to sell more oil than any other would make sense *if* said country was able to locate an uncontaminated source. 

*That* was when everything shifted into full gear. Lois ran to the only item that could be called her weapon - it wasn’t a sword; pen and paper hadn’t been the go-to tool for women like Lois in years; no, she often likened her laptop to that of a cannon. Loud. Explosive. Little room for error. Most importantly, she only had *one shot*. Her findings of fact and conclusions were sharpened, despite the lack of energy driving Lois’ motions. 

The sound of typing keys echoed throughout the apartment as Lois did everything she could to make her thoughts seem like anything more than the ramblings of a madwoman. It could be done - did it need to be done right at that moment? ***Yes***. If Lois knew one thing, it was that the world could change in a matter of seconds. All it took was a single *moment* to alter the world in such a fashion that it was impossible to live in the world before it. She’d lived through those moments - she’d *caused* her own handful of those moments. The world was always in need of change. It was the part of every man and woman, both on and off Earth, to make their home better. 

That was Lois’ duty. 

As the night continued on, Lois felt as her body began to pull towards the ground with every keystroke. She was exhausted - she had to fight - she *needed* to persist, if only for the phone call she received at 05:11 from her contact out east. The news was enough to give a second wind: ***The Quraci Government*** ***did*** ***find oil.*** A massive, unsullied, thought to be undiscovered reservoir of crude oil was found four and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the ocean. Lois got to writing. Her hands were her brush and the weathered plastic, her canvas. With each press of a lettered button, she felt a surge of energy course through her bloodstream - she was ready to change the worl-- 

The light of the new morning fully enveloped the totality of the apartment. The sounds of Metropolis - engines, birds, distant chatter on the concrete walkways - began to push their way into the home. A stray beam of sun struck the unconscious reporter directly in the face, disturbing her much needed sleep. She stirred for a moment before realizing - she was fully dressed, shoes and all, in her desk chair. Lois bolted upright, lifting her face off of the Laptop keyboard. A two page long string of “kjlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll” bookended what was sure to be the most important publishing of her career ~~so far.~~ 

She laughed and deleted the results of working herself to the bone. She could probably benefit from reviewing her submission - sending it to Perry for his review. Instead? She rose from her seat and made her way towards the window, throwing the window up along its track. Lois cleared her throat and stuck her head out of the window. A smile beamed from ear to ear.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_LOIS LANE WRITING SAMPLE\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was a certain strength in getting out of bed every morning. The mattress and pillow that someone claimed was special - a place of pure unmitigated vulnerability that every soul returned to night after night. Staying in such a familiar place was easy - bearing the responsibilities that would surely follow, took *power* to repeat day after day. Of course, there were countless people who do not always find themselves asleep in *bed*. Workstations, vehicles, the couch - all equally important and still just as required to ensure the human body could rest and recover enough to *ensure* they still had enough life to power through the next cycle. 

The morning sun peeked in through draped windows. Sparse beams of light shone in through the glass panes, spotlighting the disheveled home; pens, dirty mugs, papers, stacks of empty takeout boxes that matched the height of dog-eared stacked books. A tornado of discovery had destroyed the apartment and the pristine, emptied trashcan tucked neatly into the corner of the kitchen near the fridge signaled that no attempts to repair the damage had been made. Beneath the mess, however, was a home of stories; more stories had been told from the aged office chair than full, uninterrupted nights of sleep had been enjoyed. 

The very same office chair was currently occupied; sleep had *finally* wrapped its arms around Lois Lane, pulling her into much needed slumber. It had been a *very* long week. The Justice League did what they usually did: Stopped a world-ending threat, caused billions of dollars worth of property damage, honored in a parade - none of those stories were world changing publishings. Everyone had read them and everyone knew that safety would be coming, no matter the problem: Superman would come and save the day. But Superman couldn’t be everywhere at once. Every superhero in the *universe* could clock in at 00:01 and work until 23:59 and there would still be portions of the world that needed help - that couldn’t accept the help of the heroes the rest of the world relied on. *That* was where Lois Lane found purpose. She used her daily strength to direct her attention to the pockets of dark in the world that *needed* to be brought to light. It’s why she hadn’t been sleeping or keeping up with her apartment’s cleanliness. She simply had too important of a job to accomplish. 

The conflict in Bialya and Qurac was getting out of control - Queen Bee of Bialya made a public condemnation of the United States of America for providing military and financial aid to the nation of Qurac despite their troubled history. Qurac’s attack on Metropolis shook the nation and *Jihad*, their secret black-ops meta-human terrorist-for-hire sect, only escalated tensions between the two military powers further. Mentions of Benjamin Turner (The Bronze Tiger), George “Digger” Harkness (Captain Boomerang), Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), June Moone (Enchantress) and assorted other known, incarcerated supervillains could be found all over the internet on Quraci news sites - all around the time that Jihad’s power was wiped off the face of the Earth. It was obvious there was outside interference from the United States. 

Qurac as a nation had struggled in recent years as a result of the nuclear bomb that exploded over the airspace - another action committed by a supervillain - and as such, had been forced to rely on imports from other countries for basis necessities such as food, oil, clean water - but none of that made any sense to Lois. As far as she could see, there was no reason for the conflict to continue. Land, sure, but the concept of fighting over irradiated dirt was lost on her. Before the coffee-brewed coffee she’d been drinking like water failed her, she was deep into her search for *something* that could point her in the right direction - the missing puzzle piece to make the picture finally *click*. 

The morning light continued to seep into the apartment. Dossiers, banking records, steno-sized notepads, and multicolored sticky notes that littered tables, counters and chairs of the home finally stood out amongst the shadows of the home. The sticky notes had meaning: blue for ideas, pink for tangents, yellow for reminders, orange for facts. Every cluster of paper had an equal amount of facts. Every fact had thrice as many tangents. For every tangent, there were four ideas and for every idea there were two reminders. The system was flawed, sure, but that didn’t mean it was inefficient. There was a certain flow that directed them up towards the walls. Amongst the notes were pictures of a life. Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles.

Never food, water, art or any other resource that could further the development of mankind into a kinder, more aware society. No, it was an ancient and beautifully finite substance that caused as many wars as it powered machinery. 

It would make sense, really. Qurac once was *known* for their grip on the world’s oil supply, but was forced to surrender a most - if not all - of their government’s funds just to keep from going bankrupt. Enter the US: A country going through intensive reform after a tense few terms held by consecutive presidents. They could use a win like Lex Luthor could use a hair-loss treatment; funneling money towards the one country that used to sell more oil than any other would make sense *if* said country was able to locate an uncontaminated source. 

*That* was when everything shifted into full gear. Lois ran to the only item that could be called her weapon - it wasn’t a sword; pen and paper hadn’t been the go-to tool for women like Lois in years; no, she often likened her laptop to that of a cannon. Loud. Explosive. Little room for error. Most importantly, she only had *one shot*. Her findings of fact and conclusions were sharpened, despite the lack of energy driving Lois’ motions. 

The sound of typing keys echoed throughout the apartment as Lois did everything she could to make her thoughts seem like anything more than the ramblings of a madwoman. It could be done - did it need to be done right at that moment? ***Yes***. If Lois knew one thing, it was that the world could change in a matter of seconds. All it took was a single *moment* to alter the world in such a fashion that it was impossible to live in the world before it. She’d lived through those moments - she’d *caused* her own handful of those moments. The world was always in need of change. It was the part of every man and woman, both on and off Earth, to make their home better. 

That was Lois’ duty. 

As the night continued on, Lois felt as her body began to pull towards the ground with every keystroke. She was exhausted - she had to fight - she *needed* to persist, if only for the phone call she received at 05:11 from her contact out east. The news was enough to give a second wind: ***The Quraci Government*** ***did*** ***find oil.*** A massive, unsullied, thought to be undiscovered reservoir of crude oil was found four and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the ocean.

The light of the new morning fully enveloped the totality of the apartment.

She stirred for a moment before realizing - she was fully dressed, shoes and all, in her desk chair. Lois bolted upright, lifting her face off of the Laptop keyboard.

She laughed and deleted the results of working herself to the bone. She could probably benefit from reviewing her submission - sending it to Perry for his review. Instead? She rose from her seat and made her way towards the window, throwing the window up along its track. Lois cleared her throat and stuck her head out of the window. A smile beamed from ear to ear.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_LOIS LANE WRITING SAMPLE\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was a certain strength in getting out of bed every morning. The mattress and pillow that someone claimed was special - a place of pure unmitigated vulnerability that every soul returned to night after night. Staying in such a familiar place was easy - bearing the responsibilities that would surely follow, took *power* to repeat day after day. Of course, there were countless people who do not always find themselves asleep in *bed*. Workstations, vehicles, the couch - all equally important and still just as required to ensure the human body could rest and recover enough to *ensure* they still had enough life to power through the next cycle. 

The morning sun peeked in through draped windows. Sparse beams of light shone in through the glass panes, spotlighting the disheveled home; pens, dirty mugs, papers, stacks of empty takeout boxes that matched the height of dog-eared stacked books. A tornado of discovery had destroyed the apartment and the pristine, emptied trashcan tucked neatly into the corner of the kitchen near the fridge signaled that no attempts to repair the damage had been made. Beneath the mess, however, was a home of stories; more stories had been told from the aged office chair than full, uninterrupted nights of sleep had been enjoyed. 

The very same office chair was currently occupied; sleep had *finally* wrapped its arms around Lois Lane, pulling her into much needed slumber. It had been a *very* long week. The Justice League did what they usually did: Stopped a world-ending threat, caused billions of dollars worth of property damage, honored in a parade - none of those stories were world changing publishings. Everyone had read them and everyone knew that safety would be coming, no matter the problem: Superman would come and save the day. But Superman couldn’t be everywhere at once. Every superhero in the *universe* could clock in at 00:01 and work until 23:59 and there would still be portions of the world that needed help - that couldn’t accept the help of the heroes the rest of the world relied on. *That* was where Lois Lane found purpose. She used her daily strength to direct her attention to the pockets of dark in the world that *needed* to be brought to light. It’s why she hadn’t been sleeping or keeping up with her apartment’s cleanliness. She simply had too important of a job to accomplish. 

The conflict in Bialya and Qurac was getting out of control - Queen Bee of Bialya made a public condemnation of the United States of America for providing military and financial aid to the nation of Qurac despite their troubled history. Qurac’s attack on Metropolis shook the nation and *Jihad*, their secret black-ops meta-human terrorist-for-hire sect, only escalated tensions between the two military powers further. Mentions of Benjamin Turner (The Bronze Tiger), George “Digger” Harkness (Captain Boomerang), Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), June Moone (Enchantress) and assorted other known, incarcerated supervillains could be found all over the internet on Quraci news sites - all around the time that Jihad’s power was wiped off the face of the Earth. It was obvious there was outside interference from the United States. 

Qurac as a nation had struggled in recent years as a result of the nuclear bomb that exploded over the airspace - another action committed by a supervillain - and as such, had been forced to rely on imports from other countries for basis necessities such as food, oil, clean water - but none of that made any sense to Lois. As far as she could see, there was no reason for the conflict to continue. Land, sure, but the concept of fighting over irradiated dirt was lost on her. Before the coffee-brewed coffee she’d been drinking like water failed her, she was deep into her search for *something* that could point her in the right direction - the missing puzzle piece to make the picture finally *click*. 

The morning light continued to seep into the apartment. Dossiers, banking records, steno-sized notepads, and multicolored sticky notes that littered tables, counters and chairs of the home finally stood out amongst the shadows of the home. The sticky notes had meaning: blue for ideas, pink for tangents, yellow for reminders, orange for facts. Every cluster of paper had an equal amount of facts. Every fact had thrice as many tangents. For every tangent, there were four ideas and for every idea there were two reminders. The system was flawed, sure, but that didn’t mean it was inefficient. There was a certain flow that directed them up towards the walls. Amongst the notes were pictures of a life. Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles. History had a way of sprinkling reminders throughout time - it was only a part of the human experience to try to remember. It brought so much *joy* to Lois that she could have a hand in creating reminders. 

As the morning’s touch lit up more and more of the apartment, the details of the pages scattered throughout lost their secrets. Given the bad blood between Qurac and The United States in past years, Lois knew there had to be more behind the decision to support them in conflict, rather than maintain neutrality. It wasn’t even the *first* time that the Bialya and Qurac were at war with one another, which The United States had flawlessly avoided without so much as a press statement. There was something going on underneath the surface and Lois *had* to be the one to uncover it. If  she didn’t? It never would. She had her colleagues, but they were happy with something smaller - as many front pages as possible to raise the recognition, raise the rewards and raise the morale of the nation when it needed it most. 

So *why?* Why *Bialya?* Why *Qurac?* That was the burning question that inspired a phone call at 02:23 in the morning to one of her few contacts on that side of the world. Lois paced around her apartment, effortlessly gliding around the mess and wreckage while she continued to fight for knowledge. Lois never had the *best* Arabic, so getting information while on the brink of physical collapse was *taxing* on her mind, to say the very least; Confusion, frustration, insults and apologies were hurled through the cell phone as if they were bullets - some landed, some grazed and some missed so wide that someone else caught the stray, but she got a single lead: The Quraci Military *found* something two-hundred-fifty kilometers off of the coast, in contested waters. The call dropped and Lois was left to figure out what to do with the details she was given. 

It wasn’t impossible - all it was one snowball to barrel down the hill long enough to cause an avalanche. Lois ***yearned*** to shout from her lungs and shake the world, sending frozen white powder onto the unsuspecting minds of those who needed it most - the ones with a *voice*. The little voice in her mind was begging for her to get her eight hours in, but by the time the clock hit 03:30, she knew that sleep wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. That was when Lois began *seriously* taking notes; her printer had never seen so much action, shooting out transcripts, message logs, news reports and - most importantly expenditure accounts for all involved parties. It took a lot of digging - and that’s where the strain began to sneak in. Numbers began to blur into Times New Blobs as her vision faded in and out of focus. 

The morning light began to soak into the nooks and crannies of Lois Lane’s Fortress of Intellect. Smiling faces and moments of love could be seen all over the home. The shoes of a man who was busy doing his own part to save the world; The vase of violet tulips, lightly wilted but intensely cherished, on a slim entryway table near the front door; A magnet on the fridge consisting a photo of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, on the globe that rest atop the Daily Planet. The moments that were worth fighting for. There was no reason to fight - to *try* \- if there was nothing you could call sacred. Lois had that reason and would give every last ounce of her being to help someone else find theirs. 

Once, Qurac was known for having a wide resource of oil. It was thought to be lost after Cheshire’s nuclear strike on the nation, but recent reports suggest the opposite. A closer look into the energy expenditures account for the United States left a glaring two billion dollar hole where it shouldn’t have been. The financial backing of Qurac *did* have to originate from somewhere - as much as America brags about being the best, they still hadn’t generated the ability to make something out of nothing. 

The only issue with the budget was the source. There exists funds in the treasury *specifically* for aid in foreign affairs - so *why* ***energy?*** Simple. The Quraci Government found something of interest two-hundred-fifty kilometers off the coast, in contested waters. It was sad, really, how often everything looped back to oil.

I really wanted a glass cup from the Hailey Coffee Co but they were sold out at the time. The barista working said they should have more in stock soon but that obviously doesn’t help me who was only visiting for one day.

Hi friend, 

     I wish I could talk this through with you. You're the only one who didn't look at me like I was speaking Klingon when I talked about it. 

So, the other day I go to get coffee, like every other morning. A woman holds the door open for me. I compliment her shirt because I like the design. I don't notice until I go to leave that the shirt says ""let God open the door."" She gets into her car and I notice his name on the license plate. 

I read a fair bit of the Bible but not enough to know that particular phrase. Apparently it relates to trusting in God's plan for you, easing up on the reins, and letting things flow. Before my research the only thing I could think of was Motion City Soundtrack, hence the post title. 

Later I'm thinking about grabbing a sub, but decide not to at the last minute. Like, maybe that isn't letting things develop naturally? So as I'm making the turn into my building's parking lot there is a car directly in front of me with his name on the plate. Y'know, right as I'm arriving HOME after being good and minding my business, lmao. 

I'm probably schizophrenic, like every other person who thinks they receive messages from God/spirit/the universe. Alternatively, I could have a brain tumor lol. But I just keep hearing his(not His) voice in my head, reassuring me: trust the process. 

I'ma stay ten toes down:  win, lose, or draw. I have so many things to keep busy with anyway. I finally got my slide projector! It's from the late 50's, made by Sears. I'm going to project slides I bought from Thrifty Shopper and try to paint them. If it goes well, I'll cut a slide-sized hole in the canvas, insert the slide from the back and secure before backlighting the area with rice lights. 

I painted Jerry the flamingo black. He's gorgeous. But I have not made his Arcadia display yet. I can't decide if I want to use the wire half-moon wreath or if I want to make him into a wall installation. I also need to consider what I'm doing to the silk flowers I got. I know I want to wrap the stems in floral tape and then paint that. But the petals are too bright. I'm considering a watered-down black acrylic pass over, or a tea stain process. I know I want a few of the pieces of foliage burnt. 

I have a prayer plant, spider plant, a swiss monstera, and an elephant ears prop to nurture. 

I want to build a cat tree. 

I'm behind on books. 

I need to set up my sewing area. 

I DIDN'T CAN ANY FUCKING TOMATOES THIS YEAR AND I FEEL EMPTY INSIDE NOW. (...kidding, kind of...)

Anyway, I'll be around.

1mib31a,https://v.redd.it/wyw4gd7lq7hf1,Bolt Farm Treehouse Mini-Review,"Hi everyone, 

Thought I’d do a mini-review of Bolt Farm Treehouses in Chattanooga, TN, since it’s one I haven’t seen recommended here often, and I’d classify it as chubby.

My boyfriend and I stayed earlier this year for our anniversary, and had a great time. 

*Accommodations*: We stayed in the newer treehouse outfitted by Arhaus and it was absolutely gorgeous. They told us it was $80,000 worth of furniture (!), the bathroom floors are heated, there’s a copper standalone tub on the inside and a stone hot tub with insane views on the deck, a movie projector, different lighting controls both inside and outside, and tons of adorable details. They have an old record player, hand grinder for coffee, etc. They also have motorized blackout blinds which creates an *insane* sunrise view from the bed. 

*Grounds*: All of the cabins and treehouses are located far up a mountain (accounting for the beautiful views), and the treehouses are spread across the edge of the mountainside (I’ll attach more photos in the comments). We didn’t venture too far offsite since we were only there for a long weekend, but we did a hike, visited the spa, and planned to go paragliding but it ended up being canceled due to fog. The spa we went to was cute but small, but they were just about to open a large area that I believe will be a bigger spa area, so hopefully that’s available now. There’s a main check in area where they also do Happy Hour and other small events with live music, etc. They’ll also help you schedule activities like horseback riding or paragliding if you are interested.

*Food*: This is the one area I think they can do better in. You can pay for prepaid meals, or partake in an individual chef coming and preparing food, but otherwise nothing on-site. We ended up doing their pizza ingredient meal (there is a pizza oven outside each treehouse), the individual chef, and then we went back down the mountain to get dinner at a restaurant on one night. They do have minibar offerings in the fridge. If you can swing the cost ($200 pp), the private chef experience was awesome!

*Overall impression*: We had a magical stay, and I’d highly recommend for a romantic long weekend. This property seems to be growing rapidly and offering more and more luxury experiences.

Scaling to millions has only been a pipe dream. It's quickly moving from theoretical to implemented.

Bitcoin was digital scarcity - those two words changed society. Ethereum was programmable money and we are headed for 1tril+ of stablecoins.

HTTPS money will change society again by prying the leverage of information out of the hands of the collective and the eavesdroppers and putting back in the hands of the individual.

\--------------------------------------

# ""Tachyon: Scaling Zcash with Oblivious Synchronization

Zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. They provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. In short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

To enable this, Zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. These proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. But the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-SNARKs](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. Their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

Today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“ZK”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **We can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** We've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of Halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [Orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**Now it’s time to cross the finish line.** I am proposing several protocol changes in Zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. The crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that I refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. This new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**Crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** In the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in Zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. In order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “Sapling” upgrade from earlier in Zcash's history. Back then, we set out to make zk-SNARKs practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. The sophistication of the Sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

Here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)Proof-carrying Data

Early in the history of Zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-SNARKs. As mentioned, the [Sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. However, zk-SNARKs are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. This has led to a misconception that zk-SNARKs are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in Zcash.

In reality, we've never actually considered zk-SNARK verification a barrier to scaling Zcash. I once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. Later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being SnarkPack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

The ultimate tool for scaling zk-SNARK verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like Zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (PCD)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/CT10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind Zcash. Crudely speaking, PCD allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. This can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

PCD languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. This changed when our team at the Electric Coin Company discovered [Halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving PCD with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. As mentioned before, this led to a Cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made PCD table stakes for new scalable protocols. PCD can be leveraged to make Zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) As we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#communicating-state-changes)Communicating State Changes

zk-SNARKs and PCD are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. However, privacy-preserving protocols like Zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

There are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* How do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* How do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* How are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

Zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-SNARKs (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. By being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-SNARKs and PCD.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)Shielded Notes and Commitments

Shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [UTXOs](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in Bitcoin. We aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-SNARK to prove that various rules are being followed. In order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

The commitment hides the note, but the zk-SNARK can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. This allows the zk-SNARK proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). In order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

Secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. The standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. The user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. The user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. Other people use this address to make a payment.
4. The user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

This is how Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. The user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. In private cryptocurrencies like Zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. In order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

Zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. Recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. This simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **As a start, we'll be assuming that Zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** The on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

Fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over Signal chats. In these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most Zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. It is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [URI-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

There are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. By moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. Also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) In order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. This at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)Accumulators and Nullifiers

In order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)). Currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. We call this checkpoint an “anchor.” In order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

In order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. This works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-SNARK proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

If we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **The zk-SNARK helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** The nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. Validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**The scalability bottlenecks that remain in Zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** Currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in Zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#oblivious-synchronization)Oblivious Synchronization

It'll be helpful to recast what a Zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

The wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. In each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. Once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. In all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. As long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

Finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-SNARK proof and spend the funds. (The wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) This is more or less how our wallets currently work.

My vision for scaling Zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how Zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. Rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-SNARK proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** This means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. Then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. This effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

The result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) As a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **Despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

It would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain PCD of the wallet state. This expense is not just due to the cost of creating PCD proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

However, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the PCD proofs) to a third party that I call an **oblivious syncing service**. This service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

We already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) (FHE). **But by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use PCD.** The remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. One would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

In practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. But this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. Fortunately, as I'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

This new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the Zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. The main changes involved include:

* **Wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ECC has already begun exploring the incoporation of URI-encapsulated payments into its Zashi mobile wallet. Different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. Fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the Zcash protocol. It also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **Blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** This involves implementing and deploying a PCD-based proof aggregation protocol for Orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the Orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. This can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **Nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** This can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **Nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in PCD.** I've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. This will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **In-band secret distribution must be removed in Zcash.** This can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). Efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **The payment protocol should allow wallet PCD state to augment the zk-SNARK in transactions.** This final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. This can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**I call this the Tachyon project for Zcash.** I'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. My goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. As with all of our previous network upgrades I'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

Crucially, I don't plan to stand in the way of any other Zcash protocol improvements while I see Tachyon to fruition. I'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and I'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to Tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. I also have no reason to believe that Tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as Crosslink and ZSAs; in fact, I have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for Tachyon.

There are many things I'll be sharing over the coming weeks. I'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that I've developed to be compatible with the Orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. This should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

Stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

1mib068,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1mib068/sa_updateexperience_no_sedation_current_post_op_6/,SA update/experience - no sedation - current post op 6 days experience (positive experience),"For anyone who seen my prior post (Mother of two, 6/7 weeks pregnant, legal state, conflicted and sad but knew I needed to have it done) 

***LONG READ - MY FULL SURGICAL EXPERIENCE AND FOLLOWING 6 DAYS EXPERIENCE*** 

I was SO incredibly anxious regarding an upcoming SA appointment I had made. I kept my appointment and traveled 5 hours to get there. 

We struggled to locate the building until I found the protesters outside. I was already really nervous and anxious and having to walk up while being literally SCREAMED at by grown men was incredibly unnerving to say the least. A woman working there was in the parking lot waiting and escorted us from the lot into the building, explaining what I needed to do once I got inside, but I had just kind of dissociated in the moment and couldn’t hear what she was saying over the men screaming from the curb. so I was pretty shaken up once I got inside. 

The staff was so kind. I got inside, went to check in and was told my insurance didn’t cover it and I just BROKE down. Sobbing. Uncontrollably. In the waiting room… I was so embarrassed. I told her when I filled everything out online it said it was covered with no co pay, and that I had traveled for 5 hours to get there. but she said unfortunately in my state my insurance wouldn’t cover it. But she was so sweet and immediately got with her manager and helped me sort it out and they were able to cover most of it, thank god. and I was still able to be seen. 

It was like any other doctor appt, just lots of questions about info, health and stuff, med allergies etc. blood pressure check etc. and the two nurses I seen were so caring and sweet and kept it light and funny amidst my clear anxiety and tears. 

They didn’t have access to laughing gas so I opted for no sedation, only ibuprofen. I was SCARED. Then they did the ultrasound. They asked if I would like to see while they do it, know if there were multiples, have any photos printed or just have them check alone and not show me at all. Which I really appreciated the options. 

my nurse and doctor talked me the whole way through and it, it went quickly and for the most part, was tolerable pain. They used lidocaine shots in my cervix. The two or three shots felt like a sharp pinch but nothing I couldn’t handle. There were several times of quick sharp pain during the cervix dilating and right at the end. But nothing I couldn’t tolerate. I think it was a total of 10 minutes once it got moving. And then another 15 in recovery room before I was cleared to leave and on the way out. 

The men protesting were still outside waiting to start screaming at me again. After the whole thing it was still pretty unnerving. The lady escorted us back to our car and said “just pull right out the other side of the building, don’t stop at the end of the drive, don’t look at them just slow roll and keep going but don’t run them over” 

I had no complications, minimal bleeding after

I am 100% Content with the choices made… SA instead of MA, no seeing the ultra sound, no sedations.

****Post SA experience so far***

Overall: lots of cramping, my period started on day 4 and Ive had TERRIBLE gas & bloating post SA that hasn’t subsided. Mental health has improved GREATLY. Starting to feel back to my “normal” again. I was battling an extremely low depressive episode when I found out I was pregnant) 

DAY 1: I had cramping throughout the day of, that felt no worse than a bad period cramp day, worsening with being on my feet too long. Was able to walk into a coffee shop 30 minutes post op and grab a coffee for the road with no issues. Had a 5 hour car ride home so I sat most of the afternoon. Light bleeding.

DAY 2: mild cramping, same as first day. Worsening with too much activity or being on my feet too long. Took an ibuprofen in the evening for cramping/mild back pain. Minimal bleeding/brown spotting. A little bloated/slightly gassy. 

DAY 3: started like the previous day, minimal cramping, almost no bleeding, just brown spotting when I used the bathroom. In the afternoon, the cramps became pretty substantial all of a sudden. I would have equated them to early labor contraction pain level, including lower back pains. Not severe pain, but definitely uncomfortable. The ibuprofen 800 helped quite a bit. Insomnia, Wide awake and Couldn’t sleep until 530 am. Very gassy/bloated.

DAY 4: starting to feel a little back to normal at this point, no bleeding mild cramping. I started doing some housework and spend a lot of the day on my feet. In the evening my cramps and the back pain began to get substantial again, and when I went to the bathroom to pee there was all of a sudden what felt like A LOT of blood. It was like the first day of a heavy period. It startled me tbh because I just hadn’t expected it. I was home alone and I believe I worked myself up a bit and started getting anxiety. But after a while and the ibuprofen curbing the pain. I was fine and had realized it was just me starting my period. Insomnia, Wide awake and Couldn’t sleep until 5:30 am. Very gassy/bloated.

DAY 5: I had an outing scheduled in the morning to our local fair with our youngest and some of her peers from therapy. luckily, her father attended, because I had to drop them off with the group and stay in my car for a while and wait for the ibuprofen to start working, the cramps were so bad there was no way I was about to start walking around for 3 hours in that amount of pain. Once that kicked in I was able to go meet with them and have a normal outing for a couple hours. Cramping and normal period throughout the remainder of the day. Insomnia subsided. Very gassy/bloated. 

DAY 6 (today): last night I woke up twice while sleeping, from having to pee/bad gas pains/cramps and so far this morning am having mild cramps. STILL very gassy (painfully so) and bloated. 

*** Since the hormones have been settling, I’ve been only feeling relief. I don’t regret my decision as I know it was the best choice for me and my current children. I thought I would have feelings of regret or dwell on it longer, but honestly I am only relieved. The experience was not as bad as anticipated and I am feeling grateful I was able to make this choice early on.***

For some of you who wonder how certain cafe's (like Glitch) can pull shots that taste like nothing you've ever had before, this coffee is an example of more modern techniques that create something so expressive it's hard to wrap your head around that it's only coffee.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_LOIS LANE WRITING SAMPLE\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was a certain strength in getting out of bed every morning. The mattress and pillow that someone claimed was special - a place of pure unmitigated vulnerability that every soul returned to night after night. Staying in such a familiar place was easy - bearing the responsibilities that would surely follow, took *power* to repeat day after day. Of course, there were countless people who do not always find themselves asleep in *bed*. Workstations, vehicles, the couch - all equally important and still just as required to ensure the human body could rest and recover enough to *ensure* they still had enough life to power through the next cycle. 

The morning sun peeked in through draped windows. Sparse beams of light shone in through the glass panes, spotlighting the disheveled home; pens, dirty mugs, papers, stacks of empty takeout boxes that matched the height of dog-eared stacked books. A tornado of discovery had destroyed the apartment and the pristine, emptied trashcan tucked neatly into the corner of the kitchen near the fridge signaled that no attempts to repair the damage had been made. Beneath the mess, however, was a home of stories; more stories had been told from the aged office chair than full, uninterrupted nights of sleep had been enjoyed. 

The very same office chair was currently occupied; sleep had *finally* wrapped its arms around Lois Lane, pulling her into much needed slumber. It had been a *very* long week. The Justice League did what they usually did: Stopped a world-ending threat, caused billions of dollars worth of property damage, honored in a parade - none of those stories were world changing publishings. Everyone had read them and everyone knew that safety would be coming, no matter the problem: Superman would come and save the day. But Superman couldn’t be everywhere at once. Every superhero in the *universe* could clock in at 00:01 and work until 23:59 and there would still be portions of the world that needed help - that couldn’t accept the help of the heroes the rest of the world relied on. *That* was where Lois Lane found purpose. She used her daily strength to direct her attention to the pockets of dark in the world that *needed* to be brought to light. It’s why she hadn’t been sleeping or keeping up with her apartment’s cleanliness. She simply had too important of a job to accomplish. 

The conflict in Bialya and Qurac was getting out of control - Queen Bee of Bialya made a public condemnation of the United States of America for providing military and financial aid to the nation of Qurac despite their troubled history. Qurac’s attack on Metropolis shook the nation and *Jihad*, their secret black-ops meta-human terrorist-for-hire sect, only escalated tensions between the two military powers further. Mentions of Benjamin Turner (The Bronze Tiger), George “Digger” Harkness (Captain Boomerang), Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), June Moone (Enchantress) and assorted other known, incarcerated supervillains could be found all over the internet on Quraci news sites - all around the time that Jihad’s power was wiped off the face of the Earth. It was obvious there was outside interference from the United States. 

Qurac as a nation had struggled in recent years as a result of the nuclear bomb that exploded over the airspace - another action committed by a supervillain - and as such, had been forced to rely on imports from other countries for basis necessities such as food, oil, clean water - but none of that made any sense to Lois. As far as she could see, there was no reason for the conflict to continue. Land, sure, but the concept of fighting over irradiated dirt was lost on her. Before the coffee-brewed coffee she’d been drinking like water failed her, she was deep into her search for *something* that could point her in the right direction - the missing puzzle piece to make the picture finally *click*. 

The morning light continued to seep into the apartment. Dossiers, banking records, steno-sized notepads, and multicolored sticky notes that littered tables, counters and chairs of the home finally stood out amongst the shadows of the home. The sticky notes had meaning: blue for ideas, pink for tangents, yellow for reminders, orange for facts. Every cluster of paper had an equal amount of facts. Every fact had thrice as many tangents. For every tangent, there were four ideas and for every idea there were two reminders. The system was flawed, sure, but that didn’t mean it was inefficient. There was a certain flow that directed them up towards the walls. Amongst the notes were pictures of a life. Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles. History had a way of sprinkling reminders throughout time - it was only a part of the human experience to try to remember. It brought so much *joy* to Lois that she could have a hand in creating reminders. 

As the morning’s touch lit up more and more of the apartment, the details of the pages scattered throughout lost their secrets. Given the bad blood between Qurac and The United States in past years, Lois knew there had to be more behind the decision to support them in conflict, rather than maintain neutrality. It wasn’t even the *first* time that the Bialya and Qurac were at war with one another, which The United States had flawlessly avoided without so much as a press statement. There was something going on underneath the surface and Lois *had* to be the one to uncover it. If  she didn’t? It never would. She had her colleagues, but they were happy with something smaller - as many front pages as possible to raise the recognition, raise the rewards and raise the morale of the nation when it needed it most. 

So *why?* Why *Bialya?* Why *Qurac?* That was the burning question that inspired a phone call at 02:23 in the morning to one of her few contacts on that side of the world. Lois paced around her apartment, effortlessly gliding around the mess and wreckage while she continued to fight for knowledge. Lois never had the *best* Arabic, so getting information while on the brink of physical collapse was *taxing* on her mind, to say the very least; Confusion, frustration, insults and apologies were hurled through the cell phone as if they were bullets - some landed, some grazed and some missed so wide that someone else caught the stray, but she got a single lead: The Quraci Military *found* something two-hundred-fifty kilometers off of the coast, in contested waters. The call dropped and Lois was left to figure out what to do with the details she was given. 

It wasn’t impossible - all it was one snowball to barrel down the hill long enough to cause an avalanche. Lois ***yearned*** to shout from her lungs and shake the world, sending frozen white powder onto the unsuspecting minds of those who needed it most - the ones with a *voice*. The little voice in her mind was begging for her to get her eight hours in, but by the time the clock hit 03:30, she knew that sleep wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. That was when Lois began *seriously* taking notes; her printer had never seen so much action, shooting out transcripts, message logs, news reports and - most importantly expenditure accounts for all involved parties. It took a lot of digging - and that’s where the strain began to sneak in. Numbers began to blur into Times New Blobs as her vision faded in and out of focus. 

The morning light began to soak into the nooks and crannies of Lois Lane’s Fortress of Intellect. Smiling faces and moments of love could be seen all over the home. The shoes of a man who was busy doing his own part to save the world; The vase of violet tulips, lightly wilted but intensely cherished, on a slim entryway table near the front door; A magnet on the fridge consisting a photo of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, on the globe that rest atop the Daily Planet. The moments that were worth fighting for. There was no reason to fight - to *try* \- if there was nothing you could call sacred. Lois had that reason and would give every last ounce of her being to help someone else find theirs. 

Once, Qurac was known for having a wide resource of oil. It was thought to be lost after Cheshire’s nuclear strike on the nation, but recent reports suggest the opposite. A closer look into the energy expenditures account for the United States left a glaring two billion dollar hole where it shouldn’t have been. The financial backing of Qurac *did* have to originate from somewhere - as much as America brags about being the best, they still hadn’t generated the ability to make something out of nothing. 

The only issue with the budget was the source. There exists funds in the treasury *specifically* for aid in foreign affairs - so *why* ***energy?*** Simple. The Quraci Government found something of interest two-hundred-fifty kilometers off the coast, in contested waters. It was sad, really, how often everything looped back to oil. Never food, water, art or any other resource that could further the development of mankind into a kinder, more aware society. No, it was an ancient and beautifully finite substance that caused as many wars as it powered machinery. 

It would make sense, really. Qurac once was *known* for their grip on the world’s oil supply, but was forced to surrender a most - if not all - of their government’s funds just to keep from going bankrupt. Enter the US: A country going through intensive reform after a tense few terms held by consecutive presidents. They could use a win like Lex Luthor could use a hair-loss treatment; funneling money towards the one country that used to sell more oil than any other would make sense *if* said country was able to locate an uncontaminated source. 

*That* was when everything shifted into full gear. Lois ran to the only item that could be called her weapon - it wasn’t a sword; pen and paper hadn’t been the go-to tool for women like Lois in years; no, she often likened her laptop to that of a cannon. Loud. Explosive. Little room for error. Most importantly, she only had *one shot*. Her findings of fact and conclusions were sharpened, despite the lack of energy driving Lois’ motions. 

The sound of typing keys echoed throughout the apartment as Lois did everything she could to make her thoughts seem like anything more than the ramblings of a madwoman. It could be done - did it need to be done right at that moment? ***Yes***. If Lois knew one thing, it was that the world could change in a matter of seconds. All it took was a single *moment* to alter the world in such a fashion that it was impossible to live in the world before it. She’d lived through those moments - she’d *caused* her own handful of those moments. The world was always in need of change. It was the part of every man and woman, both on and off Earth, to make their home better. 

That was Lois’ duty. 

As the night continued on, Lois felt as her body began to pull towards the ground with every keystroke. She was exhausted - she had to fight - she *needed* to persist, if only for the phone call she received at 05:11 from her contact out east. The news was enough to give a second wind: ***The Quraci Government*** ***did*** ***find oil.*** A massive, unsullied, thought to be undiscovered reservoir of crude oil was found four and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the ocean. Lois got to writing. Her hands were her brush and the weathered plastic, her canvas. With each press of a lettered button, she felt a surge of energy course through her bloodstream - she was ready to change the worl-- 

The light of the new morning fully enveloped the totality of the apartment. The sounds of Metropolis - engines, birds, distant chatter on the concrete walkways - began to push their way into the home. A stray beam of sun struck the unconscious reporter directly in the face, disturbing her much needed sleep. She stirred for a moment before realizing - she was fully dressed, shoes and all, in her desk chair. Lois bolted upright, lifting her face off of the Laptop keyboard. A two page long string of “kjlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll” bookended what was sure to be the most important publishing of her career ~~so far.~~ 

She laughed and deleted the results of working herself to the bone. She could probably benefit from reviewing her submission - sending it to Perry for his review. Instead? She rose from her seat and made her way towards the window, throwing the window up along its track. Lois cleared her throat and stuck her head out of the window. A smile beamed from ear to ear.

Before the coffee-brewed coffee she’d been drinking like water failed her, she was deep into her search for *something* that could point her in the right direction - the missing puzzle piece to make the picture finally *click*. 

The morning light continued to seep into the apartment. Dossiers, banking records, steno-sized notepads, and multicolored sticky notes that littered tables, counters and chairs of the home finally stood out amongst the shadows of the home. The sticky notes had meaning: blue for ideas, pink for tangents, yellow for reminders, orange for facts. Every cluster of paper had an equal amount of facts. Every fact had thrice as many tangents. For every tangent, there were four ideas and for every idea there were two reminders. The system was flawed, sure, but that didn’t mean it was inefficient. There was a certain flow that directed them up towards the walls. Amongst the notes were pictures of a life. Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles. History had a way of sprinkling reminders throughout time - it was only a part of the human experience to try to remember. It brought so much *joy* to Lois that she could have a hand in creating reminders. 

As the morning’s touch lit up more and more of the apartment, the details of the pages scattered throughout lost their secrets. Given the bad blood between Qurac and The United States in past years, Lois knew there had to be more behind the decision to support them in conflict, rather than maintain neutrality. It wasn’t even the *first* time that the Bialya and Qurac were at war with one another, which The United States had flawlessly avoided without so much as a press statement. There was something going on underneath the surface and Lois *had* to be the one to uncover it. If  she didn’t? It never would. She had her colleagues, but they were happy with something smaller - as many front pages as possible to raise the recognition, raise the rewards and raise the morale of the nation when it needed it most. 

So *why?* Why *Bialya?* Why *Qurac?* That was the burning question that inspired a phone call at 02:23 in the morning to one of her few contacts on that side of the world. Lois paced around her apartment, effortlessly gliding around the mess and wreckage while she continued to fight for knowledge. Lois never had the *best* Arabic, so getting information while on the brink of physical collapse was *taxing* on her mind, to say the very least; Confusion, frustration, insults and apologies were hurled through the cell phone as if they were bullets - some landed, some grazed and some missed so wide that someone else caught the stray, but she got a single lead: The Quraci Military *found* something two-hundred-fifty kilometers off of the coast, in contested waters. The call dropped and Lois was left to figure out what to do with the details she was given. 

It wasn’t impossible - all it was one snowball to barrel down the hill long enough to cause an avalanche. Lois ***yearned*** to shout from her lungs and shake the world, sending frozen white powder onto the unsuspecting minds of those who needed it most - the ones with a *voice*. The little voice in her mind was begging for her to get her eight hours in, but by the time the clock hit 03:30, she knew that sleep wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. That was when Lois began *seriously* taking notes; her printer had never seen so much action, shooting out transcripts, message logs, news reports and - most importantly expenditure accounts for all involved parties. It took a lot of digging - and that’s where the strain began to sneak in. Numbers began to blur into Times New Blobs as her vision faded in and out of focus. 

The morning light began to soak into the nooks and crannies of Lois Lane’s Fortress of Intellect. Smiling faces and moments of love could be seen all over the home. The shoes of a man who was busy doing his own part to save the world; The vase of violet tulips, lightly wilted but intensely cherished, on a slim entryway table near the front door; A magnet on the fridge consisting a photo of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, on the globe that rest atop the Daily Planet. The moments that were worth fighting for. There was no reason to fight - to *try* \- if there was nothing you could call sacred. Lois had that reason and would give every last ounce of her being to help someone else find theirs. 

Once, Qurac was known for having a wide resource of oil. It was thought to be lost after Cheshire’s nuclear strike on the nation, but recent reports suggest the opposite. A closer look into the energy expenditures account for the United States left a glaring two billion dollar hole where it shouldn’t have been. The financial backing of Qurac *did* have to originate from somewhere - as much as America brags about being the best, they still hadn’t generated the ability to make something out of nothing. 

The only issue with the budget was the source. There exists funds in the treasury *specifically* for aid in foreign affairs - so *why* ***energy?*** Simple. The Quraci Government found something of interest two-hundred-fifty kilometers off the coast, in contested waters. It was sad, really, how often everything looped back to oil. Never food, water, art or any other resource that could further the development of mankind into a kinder, more aware society. No, it was an ancient and beautifully finite substance that caused as many wars as it powered machinery. 

It would make sense, really. Qurac once was *known* for their grip on the world’s oil supply, but was forced to surrender a most - if not all - of their government’s funds just to keep from going bankrupt. Enter the US: A country going through intensive reform after a tense few terms held by consecutive presidents. They could use a win like Lex Luthor could use a hair-loss treatment; funneling money towards the one country that used to sell more oil than any other would make sense *if* said country was able to locate an uncontaminated source. 

*That* was when everything shifted into full gear. Lois ran to the only item that could be called her weapon - it wasn’t a sword; pen and paper hadn’t been the go-to tool for women like Lois in years; no, she often likened her laptop to that of a cannon. Loud. Explosive. Little room for error. Most importantly, she only had *one shot*. Her findings of fact and conclusions were sharpened, despite the lack of energy driving Lois’ motions. 

The sound of typing keys echoed throughout the apartment as Lois did everything she could to make her thoughts seem like anything more than the ramblings of a madwoman. It could be done - did it need to be done right at that moment? ***Yes***. If Lois knew one thing, it was that the world could change in a matter of seconds. All it took was a single *moment* to alter the world in such a fashion that it was impossible to live in the world before it. She’d lived through those moments - she’d *caused* her own handful of those moments. The world was always in need of change. It was the part of every man and woman, both on and off Earth, to make their home better. 

That was Lois’ duty. 

As the night continued on, Lois felt as her body began to pull towards the ground with every keystroke. She was exhausted - she had to fight - she *needed* to persist, if only for the phone call she received at 05:11 from her contact out east. The news was enough to give a second wind: ***The Quraci Government*** ***did*** ***find oil.*** A massive, unsullied, thought to be undiscovered reservoir of crude oil was found four and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the ocean. Lois got to writing. Her hands were her brush and the weathered plastic, her canvas. With each press of a lettered button, she felt a surge of energy course through her bloodstream - she was ready to change the worl-- 

The light of the new morning fully enveloped the totality of the apartment. The sounds of Metropolis - engines, birds, distant chatter on the concrete walkways - began to push their way into the home. A stray beam of sun struck the unconscious reporter directly in the face, disturbing her much needed sleep. She stirred for a moment before realizing - she was fully dressed, shoes and all, in her desk chair. Lois bolted upright, lifting her face off of the Laptop keyboard. A two page long string of “kjlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll” bookended what was sure to be the most important publishing of her career ~~so far.~~ 

She laughed and deleted the results of working herself to the bone. She could probably benefit from reviewing her submission - sending it to Perry for his review. Instead? She rose from her seat and made her way towards the window, throwing the window up along its track. Lois cleared her throat and stuck her head out of the window. A smile beamed from ear to ear.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_LOIS LANE WRITING SAMPLE\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was a certain strength in getting out of bed every morning. The mattress and pillow that someone claimed was special - a place of pure unmitigated vulnerability that every soul returned to night after night. Staying in such a familiar place was easy - bearing the responsibilities that would surely follow, took *power* to repeat day after day. Of course, there were countless people who do not always find themselves asleep in *bed*. Workstations, vehicles, the couch - all equally important and still just as required to ensure the human body could rest and recover enough to *ensure* they still had enough life to power through the next cycle. 

The morning sun peeked in through draped windows. Sparse beams of light shone in through the glass panes, spotlighting the disheveled home; pens, dirty mugs, papers, stacks of empty takeout boxes that matched the height of dog-eared stacked books. A tornado of discovery had destroyed the apartment and the pristine, emptied trashcan tucked neatly into the corner of the kitchen near the fridge signaled that no attempts to repair the damage had been made. Beneath the mess, however, was a home of stories; more stories had been told from the aged office chair than full, uninterrupted nights of sleep had been enjoyed. 

The very same office chair was currently occupied; sleep had *finally* wrapped its arms around Lois Lane, pulling her into much needed slumber. It had been a *very* long week. The Justice League did what they usually did: Stopped a world-ending threat, caused billions of dollars worth of property damage, honored in a parade - none of those stories were world changing publishings. Everyone had read them and everyone knew that safety would be coming, no matter the problem: Superman would come and save the day. But Superman couldn’t be everywhere at once. Every superhero in the *universe* could clock in at 00:01 and work until 23:59 and there would still be portions of the world that needed help - that couldn’t accept the help of the heroes the rest of the world relied on. *That* was where Lois Lane found purpose. She used her daily strength to direct her attention to the pockets of dark in the world that *needed* to be brought to light. It’s why she hadn’t been sleeping or keeping up with her apartment’s cleanliness. She simply had too important of a job to accomplish. 

The conflict in Bialya and Qurac was getting out of control - Queen Bee of Bialya made a public condemnation of the United States of America for providing military and financial aid to the nation of Qurac despite their troubled history. Qurac’s attack on Metropolis shook the nation and *Jihad*, their secret black-ops meta-human terrorist-for-hire sect, only escalated tensions between the two military powers further. Mentions of Benjamin Turner (The Bronze Tiger), George “Digger” Harkness (Captain Boomerang), Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), June Moone (Enchantress) and assorted other known, incarcerated supervillains could be found all over the internet on Quraci news sites - all around the time that Jihad’s power was wiped off the face of the Earth. It was obvious there was outside interference from the United States. 

Qurac as a nation had struggled in recent years as a result of the nuclear bomb that exploded over the airspace - another action committed by a supervillain - and as such, had been forced to rely on imports from other countries for basis necessities such as food, oil, clean water - but none of that made any sense to Lois.

I'm from the UK, married with grown up kids and life sometimes gets a little blah, a little mundane if you will, chores and routines a never ending cycle of wake up (normally before the alarm goes off) head to work, avoid all the obnoxious idiots while trying to be productive, come home, prep and cook dinner, maybe ill wash up to if I've had a good day, tidy up, shower then relax in front of TV, although i have no control over the TV, that's the wife's domain, im just grateful Love Island has finished! 

I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important. 

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

Snapshots of memories taken by close friends, selfie cameras, within standard white blocks that made up the edges of glossy photo paper and the light black borders that encompassed various front page newspaper articles. History had a way of sprinkling reminders throughout time - it was only a part of the human experience to try to remember. It brought so much *joy* to Lois that she could have a hand in creating reminders. 

As the morning’s touch lit up more and more of the apartment, the details of the pages scattered throughout lost their secrets. Given the bad blood between Qurac and The United States in past years, Lois knew there had to be more behind the decision to support them in conflict, rather than maintain neutrality. It wasn’t even the *first* time that the Bialya and Qurac were at war with one another, which The United States had flawlessly avoided without so much as a press statement. There was something going on underneath the surface and Lois *had* to be the one to uncover it. If  she didn’t? It never would. She had her colleagues, but they were happy with something smaller - as many front pages as possible to raise the recognition, raise the rewards and raise the morale of the nation when it needed it most. 

So *why?* Why *Bialya?* Why *Qurac?* That was the burning question that inspired a phone call at 02:23 in the morning to one of her few contacts on that side of the world. Lois paced around her apartment, effortlessly gliding around the mess and wreckage while she continued to fight for knowledge. Lois never had the *best* Arabic, so getting information while on the brink of physical collapse was *taxing* on her mind, to say the very least; Confusion, frustration, insults and apologies were hurled through the cell phone as if they were bullets - some landed, some grazed and some missed so wide that someone else caught the stray, but she got a single lead: The Quraci Military *found* something two-hundred-fifty kilometers off of the coast, in contested waters. The call dropped and Lois was left to figure out what to do with the details she was given. 

It wasn’t impossible - all it was one snowball to barrel down the hill long enough to cause an avalanche. Lois ***yearned*** to shout from her lungs and shake the world, sending frozen white powder onto the unsuspecting minds of those who needed it most - the ones with a *voice*. The little voice in her mind was begging for her to get her eight hours in, but by the time the clock hit 03:30, she knew that sleep wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. That was when Lois began *seriously* taking notes; her printer had never seen so much action, shooting out transcripts, message logs, news reports and - most importantly expenditure accounts for all involved parties. It took a lot of digging - and that’s where the strain began to sneak in. Numbers began to blur into Times New Blobs as her vision faded in and out of focus. 

The morning light began to soak into the nooks and crannies of Lois Lane’s Fortress of Intellect. Smiling faces and moments of love could be seen all over the home. The shoes of a man who was busy doing his own part to save the world; The vase of violet tulips, lightly wilted but intensely cherished, on a slim entryway table near the front door; A magnet on the fridge consisting a photo of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, on the globe that rest atop the Daily Planet. The moments that were worth fighting for. There was no reason to fight - to *try* \- if there was nothing you could call sacred. Lois had that reason and would give every last ounce of her being to help someone else find theirs. 

Once, Qurac was known for having a wide resource of oil. It was thought to be lost after Cheshire’s nuclear strike on the nation, but recent reports suggest the opposite. A closer look into the energy expenditures account for the United States left a glaring two billion dollar hole where it shouldn’t have been. The financial backing of Qurac *did* have to originate from somewhere - as much as America brags about being the best, they still hadn’t generated the ability to make something out of nothing. 

The only issue with the budget was the source. There exists funds in the treasury *specifically* for aid in foreign affairs - so *why* ***energy?*** Simple. The Quraci Government found something of interest two-hundred-fifty kilometers off the coast, in contested waters. It was sad, really, how often everything looped back to oil. Never food, water, art or any other resource that could further the development of mankind into a kinder, more aware society. No, it was an ancient and beautifully finite substance that caused as many wars as it powered machinery. 

It would make sense, really. Qurac once was *known* for their grip on the world’s oil supply, but was forced to surrender a most - if not all - of their government’s funds just to keep from going bankrupt. Enter the US: A country going through intensive reform after a tense few terms held by consecutive presidents. They could use a win like Lex Luthor could use a hair-loss treatment; funneling money towards the one country that used to sell more oil than any other would make sense *if* said country was able to locate an uncontaminated source. 

*That* was when everything shifted into full gear. Lois ran to the only item that could be called her weapon - it wasn’t a sword; pen and paper hadn’t been the go-to tool for women like Lois in years; no, she often likened her laptop to that of a cannon. Loud. Explosive. Little room for error. Most importantly, she only had *one shot*. Her findings of fact and conclusions were sharpened, despite the lack of energy driving Lois’ motions. 

The sound of typing keys echoed throughout the apartment as Lois did everything she could to make her thoughts seem like anything more than the ramblings of a madwoman. It could be done - did it need to be done right at that moment? ***Yes***. If Lois knew one thing, it was that the world could change in a matter of seconds. All it took was a single *moment* to alter the world in such a fashion that it was impossible to live in the world before it. She’d lived through those moments - she’d *caused* her own handful of those moments. The world was always in need of change. It was the part of every man and woman, both on and off Earth, to make their home better. 

That was Lois’ duty. 

As the night continued on, Lois felt as her body began to pull towards the ground with every keystroke. She was exhausted - she had to fight - she *needed* to persist, if only for the phone call she received at 05:11 from her contact out east. The news was enough to give a second wind: ***The Quraci Government*** ***did*** ***find oil.*** A massive, unsullied, thought to be undiscovered reservoir of crude oil was found four and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the ocean. Lois got to writing. Her hands were her brush and the weathered plastic, her canvas. With each press of a lettered button, she felt a surge of energy course through her bloodstream - she was ready to change the worl-- 

The light of the new morning fully enveloped the totality of the apartment. The sounds of Metropolis - engines, birds, distant chatter on the concrete walkways - began to push their way into the home. A stray beam of sun struck the unconscious reporter directly in the face, disturbing her much needed sleep. She stirred for a moment before realizing - she was fully dressed, shoes and all, in her desk chair. Lois bolted upright, lifting her face off of the Laptop keyboard. A two page long string of “kjlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll” bookended what was sure to be the most important publishing of her career ~~so far.~~ 

She laughed and deleted the results of working herself to the bone. She could probably benefit from reviewing her submission - sending it to Perry for his review. Instead? She rose from her seat and made her way towards the window, throwing the window up along its track. Lois cleared her throat and stuck her head out of the window. A smile beamed from ear to ear.

As a beginner in the speciality world of coffee, I'm here to take your feedback and suggestions. 

As part of my mix easy pour blue tokai sachets, this was my second pick after hearing so much about this on the sub.

Few observations/questions:
1. It stands true to it's claim of being earthy, yes but nutty? (Not sure, what am I missing here, can someone explain?)
2. Once again I had to add milk and sugar to make it as per my taste (black coffee ain't for everyone I guess)
3. Here when I added milk and sugar, the coffee became cold super soon, anything I should take care of?
4. Recently got a sipologie pourover gifted to me by my friend, which pre ground coffee should I go with? Also, can I use that to make cold brew?

We have been through a LOT together, yadda yadda. Very close. Very comfortable with each other. We say we're the only people we can sit in a room or car trip in silence and its not awkward whatsoever. Blah blah.

She has 2 kids now between the ages of 3-5. Both her and her husband are very involved loving parents. Both work full time and both make really high earnings, she works 3 days at home every week. 

Tiny bit of background. I feel like i have definitely put in more effort in our friendship over the years. She has too of course but if I'm being honest not the same as me, and I get it she has kids and is very busy so I knew I would have to pick up the slack more. There was a few years where I lived about a 1.5 hour drive away with my ex at the time who I was with for 3 years. I had a car at the time and I was the one who made the drive out to see her twice a month. She had NEVER come to see me or even meet my ex. She never met my ex who i dated for 3 years. She never offered to make the drive. Which is fine, i lived out in the boonies, she has kids. I didnt mind picking up the slack because shes my bestie and I wanted to be supportive in any way I can.

Then I moved and was then about a 20 minute drive away from her. I didnt have a car anymore so I either would pay 50-60 dollars to uber to and from her place, or take 3 city busses to get to her which took over an hour depending on how long the busses took. She came to my place once to drop something off, sat inside for a bit to chit chat then left. But 99% of the time it was me coming to her, which is fine because she lives in a nice part of the city while I lived in more of a shady area.

Now? I live a 5 minute drive away, or a 45 minute walk. I have seen her *twice* this year. Twice. 

She basically has stopped making any and all effort to see me. She will still text when I text her, and the texting seems normal, she'll answer my ""omg hey long time no talk how has your week been how's the family etc"" texts just fine, but always ignores the parts where I say ""whenever youre able to swing it we should get a coffee/lunch/dinner/ I'll come over with teas"". I have asked to hang out several times this year when shes free and she has either ignored it or says something to the affect of how busy shes been or something. Anytime I ask how she is, she'll emphasize all this chaos in her life (baby was sick, now shes sick, the daycare they use is closing, her dog got sprayed by a skunk, toddler wont sleep, etc) I always emphasize and ask if there's anything I can do to help (which i know there isn't but just letting her know I'm here for support) so that's why the last time I asked to hang out I basically put the ball in her court. I said whenever she has free time and wants to use it to catch up with me then let me know, because I was getting tired of the rejection (didnt tell her that part)

Anyway, we usually used to text every day or every other day, about random shit too. We would send memes, etc, but thats all basically  stopped and I feel like I'm getting ghosted or broken up with with my best friend of over 10 years. She also has multiple villages. She has her parents, and her husband's parents are divorced and married into loving supportive families who are all very involved in their and their kids life, she does have the option to be able to just drop her kids off at any of these places whenever she wants to. Just want to mention that in case anyone suggests that she's doing all of this alone, which shes definitely not.

I know the easy solution is to talk to her. But I'll ask her if shes okay and thats when she'll say like ""oh yeah good over here just chaos of vomitting and sleepless nights!"" Or something like that, but i honestly just *dont want to* ask her ""did i do something wrong?"", because if I did then she can come to me about it, but the fact that shes not (if that's the case) shows she doesn't care, so why should I care too then? I know shes probably stressed out with life, but whenever I give her empathy she'll say ""no its all okay though I love it and everything we do i wouldn't have it any other way"" or something and ill be like ""awww that's the spirit :)"" or some shit I dont fucking know

All my life ive been a chronic people pleaser, going above and beyond, going out of my way financially and emotionally for my friends, and I'm tired of it. If Jenny is comfortable with not seeing me then I want to just be like ""okay 🤷‍♀️"" and just not give a shit and focus on me and my life, but it does pain me, because I thought we were best friends. Again I dont want to or want to care to be the one to address the distance, I am ALWAYS the one who does any of that. I feel like I carry the emotional needs of a friendship, and that i want this to be my first ""okay 🖕"", i know that's harsh, but I'm hurting, and just because I dont have kids doesnt mean I dont have feelings or that me and my life dont matter either.

Has anyone gone through this? I'm sure so many people obviously but just opening up the discussion.

1miatwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1miatwf/hungry_hungry_guest_part_1/,Hungry Hungry guest part 1,"I spent last summer working night shift at the Cheap Sleep Motel. A dingy place in the middle of nowhere with nothing around it for miles. At the time I really needed the money. It had ten rooms and was laid out as an L-shaped single storey accommodation. The Welcome Office where I spent most of my shift was next to the bottom right of the L. 



Cheap Sleep Motel offered amenities such as a coin operated washer/dryer, vending machines with expired goods and a swimming pool behind the long part of the L that could not possibly have met health and safety regulations. My job was to sit behind the front desk and check any customers in. There were other menial aspects of the job too but mostly I sat on my ass and watched terrible shows on a mini TV on the desk. The odd night provided entertainment with couples fighting, people having obvious affairs or some very unsavoury characters coming their visits almost always preceding a visit from the police looking for them. Most customers were middle-aged men who reeked of loneliness. If I had been a good-looking girl I’d have been nervous working that job. I wasn’t. I hadn’t needed a mirror to tell me that. The mocking laughter of other girls throughout high school, the unmasked revulsion from boys … I was ugly and that was that.



One night only a few hours into my shift, around midnight, they arrived. A leviathan of a truck pulled into the parking lot like some giant sea creature in the ocean of black night. Its glaring bright eyes blasted into the Welcome Office where I sat watching trash on TV and stuffing crap down my throat. I felt my podgy body vibrate at the guttural growl of the vehicle’s rumbling engine. The headlights went off and the engine cut out, I remember being relieved as I started to worry the noise would wake guests who’d inevitably yell at me as if it was my damn truck. The parking lot was sparsely lit by temperamental tall lamps emitting dim white light in patches. Most of the place was in darkness. A seedy red light buzzed on and off in an indiscernible sequence illuminating the entire parking lot when it was on. It was the neon sign for the motel that caused this.



He climbed out of the driver’s cabin and into that flashing crimson light. A giant with a white baseball cap and dark scraggly beard. He fit the trucker stereotype aesthetically. Instead of heading towards the office he stepped around the front of his steel beast. Even with the big man beside it, he looked freakishly close to seven feet tall, the truck was monstrous. What the hell was he transporting? The driver opened the passenger side door and assisted a second person down. Even at a distance and in awkward lighting it was clear that she was beautiful. 



Tall leather boots and denim shorts with lots of slender legs between. A pink short-sleeved shirt playfully tied up to reveal an utterly flat belly. Her face was precisely what TV, movies and magazines told every woman they should be. A defined yet delicate chin, puffy yet sleek lips, a nose that was not large nor small, clear cheekbones and large mesmerizing purple eyes. Her golden hair was full of volume and looked as if she had just emerged from a salon. God I instantly hated her.



The pair entered the Welcome Office tingling the annoying bell. In better lighting, up close the woman was exceptionally more beautiful. She smiled softly and walked with unassuming confidence. In contrast the man for all his size looked weary with thick dark bags lining his bloodshot eyes. He was dishevelled and moved like a man on the brink of collapse. 



“Good evening.” I said as was required of me. My voice was raspy and dry.



“Hi there darling!” The woman said with incredible energy and authenticity. Her teeth were pearl white and her voice exotic in sound yet eloquent. “How are you getting on tonight?”



I was temporarily stunned. In all the months I’d worked at the Motel until now I’m certain no other guest had asked me that.



“Fine … I suppose. How are you ma’am?” I responded.



“I’m doing fine too!” The woman replied. “Excuse Big Dan, he's awfully tired from the road.” I looked to the large man and was struck suddenly by something strange. Behind the beard and under the hat worn low Big Dan looked incredibly young. Early twenties for sure.“ You got any coffee?” He asked. His voice too was youthful although gruff with weariness.



“Yeah.” I said and pointed in the corner. “The machine is free for guests.”



“Isn’t that wonderful dear? Free for guests!” The woman said with extreme delight that the aged coffee machine did not warrant. “I’ll check us in and you go and top up.”



Big Dan marched over to the machine, pressed the faded buttons and it clunked to life.



“One room for one night please … Amy.” The woman looked at my name tag. My teal work polo shirt was covered in crumbs and bulged awkwardly around my mass. Why wasn’t she looking down at me like all the others did? There was no hint of disdain in those purple eyes, no sarcasm in her kind voice.



“No problem. If you can sign in the ledger and provide some ID it’s forty five dollars for the night.” I said mechanically as I had many times before. 



“Sure thing.” The woman reached into her pocket and fished out a thick wad of cash. I looked over and saw Big Dan guzzle down his hot coffee like he was dying of thirst. He placed the paper cup back in the machine and pressed it for more.



“I’m Aurelia and that’s Big Dan.” She placed ten twenty dollar bills on the desk in front of me. “Is that okay with you sweetheart?”



It wasn’t the first time I’d let the ID rule slide and like I sat at the time I was desperate for cash. And so Aurelia and Dan Smith received the key Room number 2. Big Dan polished off a third cup of coffee somewhat counterintuitively before bed before Aurelia called him over. 



The beautiful woman gave me a heartfelt thanks before they exited out and into the night. If I had refused the bribe and demanded their ID I often wonder how differently that night might have turned out. Would then have simply left, carried on to the next motel and left us all alone? I don’t know but I cannot change the past.



Something happened to my little TV. It was only after the strange pair had left and I filled in their paperwork with lies - the hundred and fifty change sitting nicely in my pocket - that I noticed it. At first I thought I’d accidentally switched over to a weird late night psychedelic channel. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope toy, whirling shapes of purple and blue moved in a mesmerizing pattern. A low, quiet but immensely pleasant hum accompanied the strange imagery. It was a very meditative experience to watch and listen. 



I stared into the swirling pattern, listening to that nice sound for God knows how long until I finally tried changing the channel. What had previously shown reality shows now also displayed the patterns and played the sound. Every channel did. Again I found myself staring unblinking into the pattern. Suddenly the deskphone rang out and tore me from the mindless stupor. The flashing light on the phone showed it was Room 5 calling. Long-term Louie. A short, irritable, bald and recently divorce man who’d paid a month up front. His semi-permanence convinced him he was entitled to a level of service a place called Cheap Sleep Motel was never going to provide. 



His grating voice entered my ear through the receiver. He bitched about his TV acting up, describing exactly what I was seeing on my TV. Unsure what the hell he was expecting me to do about it I relented and agreed to go over to check in person. Otherwise he was liable to march over and give me a lecture or make a complaint to my boss in the morning. Prick.



I locked the Welcome Office door per policy and headed over to Room 5. I walked past the giant truck on my way there. Its exhausts reached up high and ended sharp as if they were horns for the beast. The sleeper cabin portion of the front was enormous, a decent living space was likely inside. Travelling for days on end must be brutal and I understood why they’d want to spend a night in a real bed, even one at a cheap motel. There was no signage on the cab or trailer and both were painted pure black. I saw there were vents lining the top of the trailer on the driver’s side and in the unreliable red light I saw liquid dribbling out of each vent leaving the trailer’s exterior viscous and glistening. 



At the time I wondered if Big Dan was hauling meats or some such but couldn’t fathom what would require ventilation and produce the strange slime. I looked at the back of the trailer and saw it was covered in locks at least half a dozen. All looked thick and impossible to force or cut. Some required number codes but most required keys of varying size. Something very valuable lay within that trailer. Something very valuable indeed.



Long-term Louie opened the door to Room 5 after I barely knocked it once. This asshole was the main source of all my issues at work this summer.



“Finally!” He hissed like a sweating, chubby snake. His grey dressing gown and slippers served to make me as uncomfortable as possible and made him look more reptile than man. “Fix it then!” He said and turned his back to me.



 He sat himself on the room’s double bed with his arms crossed. No wonder the dickhead was divorced. My trust taser sat in my pocket and I patted it assuredly as I entered. He hadn’t given me any of that kind of trouble before but I secretly wished for an excuse to electrify the asshat. Every room at Cheap Sleep was identical. Well-worn double bed with faded basic coverings, a weirdly positioned chair that faced the bed and a cheap wall-mounted TV. Rotting wooden drawers and eternally squeaky cupboards completed the dilapidated theme the designers were going for. A white door led to the equally depressing bathroom. 



Sure enough the kaleidoscopic pattern was on Louie’s TV and it played that pleasant hum. I made a token effort of fiddling with the remote and inspecting the wiring around the TV for long enough to at least give the impression I was trying to help the asshole. When I was close to trying to just leave Louie stood up and opened his blinds. Each room had a window that looked out at the parking lot and one out the rear. Room 5 looked out back onto the pool area. It was a warm night and for some incomprehensible reason Louie didn’t have his AC on. He seemed to like to stew in his own sweat and filth. 



He mumbled complaints at my incompetence and opened the rear window allowing more hot air to enter. As he got up I noticed the roll of tissues and tub of moisturiser sitting on his bedside table. His late night TV watching that had been interrupted made me taste bile. 



Then Louie audibly gasped. He was staring dumbfounded out the window. While he was distracted I ‘solved’ the TV problem by unplugging it. The images and sounds did not stop … Not only that I was convinced the humming was getting louder, pressing the volume buttons did nothing to change that. Also the visuals seemed suddenly more stimulating. My whole body tingled in response to the dual sensory exposure. It felt good. 



Louie still stood staring outside so I decided to see what had elicited that reaction from him. Standing on the low diving board of the pool, dripping wet was Aurelia. Her hair was slicked back and soaked and she wore a perfectly form fitting dark one-piece swimsuit. She was practically inhuman. She was plucked from the realm of male fantasy and dropped into this grimy motel. My vision was off. It was like when you stare at something on screen for too long and when you look away the image remains superimposed. The purple patterns were overlaid with Aurelia on that diving board. The spinning patterns flowed around her body, matching the rhythm of her slight bounces on the board. Her breasts giggled seductively before she launched up into the air. It seemed she hung there mid-air for several seconds blessing me and Louie with her magnificent visage before finally plummeting into the water with only a slight splash.



“Thanks for your help Laurey.” Louie said getting my name wrong again. He looked at me then and his expression of glee was wiped when he saw me instead of the goddess outside. It must have been like beauty whiplash to him. “Forget about the TV, I'm suddenly in the mood for a midnight dip.”



He all but shoved me out the room before slamming the door behind me. The pattern had now left my vision but had been replaced with the image of Aurelia mid-jump. I rubbed my eyes fiercely but the image remained burned into my retinas.



I tossed the little TV into the Welcome Office storage closet - it too kept working when I tried to unplug it. I hoped the other guests wouldn’t start calling up in sequence to complain, that made me guess not all the TVs had been affected. With my primary passtime decommissioned I fished out one of the emergency books I always kept in my backpack. It was pulpy romantic nonsense but served its purpose.



Around thirty minutes since visiting Room 5 I sat reading until a noise from outside caught my attention. Giggling. In the flickering red light I first spotted Aurelia still wearing her one-piece swimsuit, barefoot and trailing water behind her. Louie followed her, his hand in hers, with her leading him across the parking lot towards the big black truck. He was similarly soaking and wore a god awful blue speedo. I thought I was hallucinating. Why the hell would someone like her even be touching a gross fatso like him. Aurelia unlocked the sleeper cabin door with a key and climbed inside with Louie clambering in after her like a hungry dog. The cabin door shut behind him.



I stared out at the dark truck but could see nothing of the interior. Was that woman mad? Maybe sex-crazed or simply a hooker? I speculated but could not reach a satisfying answer. What hooker travels around with a Trucker especially looking as perfect as she did? I had a cup of tar-like but free coffee and kept an eye on the truck. About five minutes later the cabin door opened and Aurelia dropped out alone and locked the door behind her. Where the hell was Louie? The woman looked directly at me, her purple eyes seeming to glow in the darkness, and she gave me a friendly wave.

6 months ago, I shared my Apple Health data analysis project here and was blown away by the response - over 201 upvotes and so many thoughtful comments!

The most common question I kept getting was: **""How can I set this up for my own data?""**

Since many of you have been collecting health data for years (some mentioned 3GB+ of data!), I realized a web-based solution wouldn't work - uploading gigabytes of personal health data isn't practical or secure.

So I built a **Mac app** that lets you analyze your Apple Health data locally on your computer:

🔒 **Privacy-focused**: Everything runs on your Mac - your health data never leaves your device  
📊 **Handles large datasets**: Works seamlessly with years of data (3GB+ no problem)  
🤖 **AI analysis**: Supports local AI analysis using Ollama if you want deeper insights  
📈 **Export capabilities**: Clean exports and visualizations of your health trends

The app is $4.99 on the Mac App Store (think of it as buying me a coffee for the effort 😊): [**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-data-ai-analyzer/id6749297170**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-data-ai-analyzer/id6749297170)

For those who were asking about privacy - this was a key design decision. Since this is such personal data, I wanted to make sure you have complete control over it.

Would love to hear what insights you discover from your own data! And as always, happy to answer any questions.",1,1754404121.0,QuantifiedSelf,2,0.67,False

I’m working on a project exploring why **India doesn’t have a widely standardized laundromat system** like in many other countries. Despite rapid urban migration, especially to cities like Bengaluru for **education and jobs**, the laundry service market here remains mostly fragmented and unorganized.

I’m considering the idea of a **self-service laundro café** in Bengaluru – a space where people can do their laundry using **a scheduled, app-based payment system** while enjoying coffee, snacks, and Wi-Fi.

Quick survey:

1. Would you use such a place if it was near your PG/hostel/office?
2. What features would make it worth visiting regularly?
3. Which areas in Bengaluru do you think would work best?

1miaow3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1miaow3/i_had_a_setback_but_im_back_im_never_going_to/,I had a setback. But I'm back. I'm never going to stop trying to quit.,"I surpassed 100 days sober last week. I reached out to my most recent ex when I did, as my drinking problem played a major role in our split. I expressed all the positive changes I made, all of which were true, and finished by asking if she wanted to meet up for coffee. She politely declined. We had been together for 9 years until last November.

In my mind, I got sober for close to four months for me, but maybe I did it for her and the hopes I'd get her back more than I thought, because right now I feel empty. I didn't expect to be so rocked by this outcome. I put plans in place ahead of reaching out to her in the case of this happening. Like, developing new goals and something else to work toward. But I didn't expect this to hit me so hard, even though I went into the conversation knowing there was a strong possibility she would decline. Textbook definition of ""getting your hopes up"" I guess.

Anyway, after the short text exchange, which ended without a fight or friction of any kind - I made sure not to come on too strong and just thanked her for responding - I kind of said fuck it and went to the liquor store. It felt odd, like I knew in real time it didn't need to happen. But also like I knew I wasn't going to get out of control and stereotypically open a handle of vodka in the liquor store parking lot and chug it all down while crying my eyes out. I felt sort of indifferent to it. I sat around my place and drank 8 beers over about 5 hours. I bought 10 beers. At the end of the night, I poured the remaining two out. I was drunk, but usually when I binge like that I mix liquor in and even drive back to the store to get into double digit drinks. I'm not sharing this detail as some kind of moral victory, just explaining what happened.

I went to bed without reaching out to her or doing anything problematic, really. Didn't drink Sunday, didn't drink Monday. I dived right back into my sobriety support systems and got back to doing everything I did to get to where I was these last 48 hours. I don't know if it sounds like I'm being too dismissive or arrogant or what, but I kind of knew after that night that the floodgates would not open. It is alarming that it was that easy for me to do what I did, but I didn't wake up on Sunday morning thinking my old, dark life was back. Those 100 days provided a blueprint. They showed me that a life without alcohol was more than possible; it was enjoyable. It was meaningful. These are things I was terrified of before my last Day 1, things I couldn't possibly envision. But the blueprint showed me otherwise. I'm not going to stop doing the work. This setback needs to be addressed and worked through, so the next time life throws a fastball at my face I don't just feel ""indifferent"" again. I have to figure out what went wrong this time. I have therapy today, I'm going to an AA meeting tomorrow.

I am devastated by what looks to be the official end of my relationship and these last few days have been some of the hardest of my life. On one of those, I used alcohol to cope. It didn't make anything better. Shocking, right? I could have told you that going in. I'm going to cope with these raw emotions sober now because I genuinely do not want to cope with them drunk. I'm going to keep fighting for myself because I know for a fact it will pay off eventually to do this sober. Happiness will come. To drink is to be untrue to myself. I guess I felt like I was doing things the right way finally, and was starting to deserve good things, and didn't get them. And that is hard. But I know that is also a flawed, naive way of thinking. I'm not a super patient person, but I need to be. 3.5 months sober is an achievement, but it is a relatively short amount of time. Plus, as bad as I want her to want me, I can't change the fact that the damage has been done in her mind, and she knows she is better off without me around. I'm in a lot of pain right now. But the alternative is more pain, destruction and prolonged hopelessness. I'm choosing to be resilient. Thank you to anyone who got this far in the post.

I (31F) have an older sister (36) who has four children—two from a previous relationship and two from her last marriage. Her last husband wasn’t a good man. Years ago, my niece (who was 13 at the time) said she caught him secretly recording her with his phone. The police didn't find proof, but he fled the country right after, which told me everything I needed to know. I believed my niece, even when my sister didn’t. Months later, my sister followed him back to his country. At the time, I was 23 and furious.

Years later, she admitted he had confessed to doing it. She never told anyone when it happened, just said she didn’t want to be with him anymore. She ended up needing government help to support her kids and started dating someone new—not only from the same nationality as her ex but also his cousin. I was shocked, but stayed quiet because she’s older and I had my own family. What always hurt me was seeing the impact on my niece—she struggled with suicidal thoughts and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That broke me.

This new boyfriend seemed okay at first, but when he drank, he became someone else. Four years ago, my niece called me crying because the police had arrested my sister for stabbing him. My sister claimed he tried to rape her while choking her, and she used a butter knife to defend herself. He never pressed charges, so she got a restraining order and lost her job. She told us they broke up, but later we found out they were back together.

This became a cycle. She’d leave him and go back again and again. Last year, she said she was only with him because he threatened her family if he was deported. I was disgusted that she would keep him in her kids' lives. He manipulated her—telling her our mom didn’t love her and that our family loved my brother and me more. He bought her things, then took them away during fights. It’s emotional abuse.

I tried to warn her. She had teenage sons now, and if they ever saw him hurt her, they'd naturally try to protect their mom. But she didn’t listen. She moved him in again. Her kids lived in a constant cycle of chaos, and it affected their mental health and stability.

This year, after one of their many fights, she went back to our home country, met someone else, and even got married. Then she came back and got back with the boyfriend again. The new husband found out, and it was another disaster. Then she lied to us again and said it was over. I believed her.

We went to Florida together to help her relocate and find a better life. I thought she was finally serious about moving on. But once we got back, I sensed something was off. A few days later, I saw her on TikTok riding on a motorbike with someone whose face I couldn’t see. When I called her, she lied and said she went riding in Pennsylvania with friends. I knew in my gut she was back with him.

She stopped answering. For three weeks, we haven’t spoken—and during this time, I’ve felt peace. No stress. No worry. Just peace. She’s been DMing me sister quotes on Instagram, trying to get a reaction, but I haven’t responded.

She told my mom she’s not with him anymore, but I just found out she is still with him. I had invited her to talk over coffee this week, but now I’m wondering if I should cancel. I’m tired. Tired of the lies. Tired of the drama. Tired of worrying about her kids and getting dragged into a mess I can’t fix. I have three daughters of my own, and my priority is their peace and safety.

I feel guilty. I love my sister, but I’m done enabling her. She always calls us in an emergency, but then says we don’t support her. My brother is done—he doesn’t even invite her to family events anymore. She says she can’t count on us, but what more can we do?

Should I cancel the meeting? I need help.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions is essential for making an informed purchase decision. This section answers frequently asked questions about tall coffee cups, covering compatibility, maintenance, and warranty aspects.

**Are tall coffee cups dishwasher safe?**
The dishwasher safety of a tall coffee cup depends on the materials and construction. Stainless steel cups are generally dishwasher safe, although it's recommended to place them on the top rack to avoid potential damage to the finish. Ceramic cups may also be dishwasher safe, but delicate designs or painted surfaces may require hand washing. Plastic cups should be checked for dishwasher compatibility,as high temperatures can cause warping or discoloration. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning guidelines.

Effective cleaning involves both regular maintenance and occasional deep cleaning. For daily cleaning, warm soapy water and a soft sponge or brush are sufficient. Pay attention to the lid and any crevices where coffee residue may accumulate. For deep cleaning, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water to remove stubborn stains or odors. Alternatively, soaking the cup in a solution of vinegar and water can help dissolve mineral deposits. Rinse thoroughly after cleaning to ensure no residue remains.

**What is the typical lifespan of a tall coffee cup?**
The lifespan of a tall coffee cup varies depending on the materials used and how well it's maintained. Stainless steel cups, if properly cared for, can last for many years due to their durability and resistance to corrosion.Ceramic cups, while aesthetically pleasing, might potentially be more prone to chipping or breaking, perhaps shortening their lifespan.Plastic cups can also last for several years, but they may degrade over time due to exposure to heat and chemicals. Regular cleaning and careful handling can significantly extend the lifespan of any tall coffee cup.

**What should I look for in a warranty for a tall coffee cup?**
A warranty provides peace of mind, assuring you of the manufacturer's commitment to quality. Look for warranties that cover manufacturing defects, such as faulty insulation or leaking lids. The duration of the warranty is also vital,with longer warranties indicating greater confidence in the product's durability.Understand the terms and conditions of the warranty, including what is covered and what is excluded.

I was homeschooled so I didn’t get exposed to this treatment and even in college I had friends in all sorts of circles that I bounced around but always felt like the outsider. 

It’s only in the last couple years that I realize I have been taken advantage of in nearly all relationships I had including my first marriage. I am extremely empathetic, I listen, I give what I hope is good advice, I support people and give them things as a way to show I appreciate them. I have babysat friends kids for free when their work schedules were weird, hosted dinners and parties, initiated play dates and mom-only hangs (albeit inconsistently because of my wacky energy level swings and depression) and I’m all of a sudden the bad guy. 

I’ve had people ghost me because I stood up for THEM against the way they were being treated in their marriage. I put a boundary down with hanging out with a moochy mom with terribly behaved kids and then she started talking about me behind my back. I’m friends with a person who is very similar to me and the broader mom group is mad that we had our own coffee hangs and family things together and didn’t invite them because we’re closer friends and a huge blow up took place regarding our kids school and teachers and one of the moms and I have now been called a bitch because they think I was involved when I wasn’t, I just knew the details from gossip I heard (not spread myself!) 

After this happened I told my close friend that I’m tired of the guilt by association and that it can’t keep happening this school year and she’s been pulling back. Again, because I’m setting a boundary I really needed to set for my sanity. I get panic attacks now having to go to the school and potentially come in eyeshot of these women. 

Are all women like this?! Is it just that I’m the weird one out and they all have uncanny valley with me so they make up stories about me because there’s just*something* they don’t like about me so they create drama where there was none? All of these friendships started off with me being incredibly generous and kind and a listening ear. If you’ve heard the term “sin eater”, which I learned recently, it describes the dynamic to a T. When I stopped having the capacity to deal with their emotional dumping or using me for their own benefit with zero reciprocation, the issues started. Or I would cancel a couple times on mom nights out because of a migraine or just not feeling social - also my spidey sense could tell I didn’t want to be around some of the other women in the circle - which kudos to me for pattern recognition and avoiding even more harm than I have experienced but it just never ends. It’s been going on for over a year now and I will have to see these people for at least another three years since their kids are same year as mine.

1miajgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1miajgr/ex_wants_me_and_his_gf_to_hang_out_and_be_friends/,Ex wants me and his Gf to hang out and be friends,"Hi all. We are about two years in to our coparenting relationship and it has been civil and friendly. But we don’t hang out. We have done our son’s birthday parties together, went to kindergarten graduation, sports events, etc. everything where we have been around each other is a child-focused activity. I am happy to do so because it’s what is best for our child. 

My ex has a newish girlfriend, he introduced our son to her after 6 months per the parenting agreement. And now, he has sent me a couple of messages about how he wants us to all hang out and be friends. He has said his gf is willing to meet me for coffee or a drink to get to know each other. I have declined. 

Last week he sent me a very emotional plea that we should all be together and our son wants us all to be together and it would be better for him. It was kind of out of left field and I suspect he was drinking (alcoholic). There is a lot more context, he is very controlling and was really abusive to me during our relationship, but I just wanted to ask the group on the merits of his request. 

I declined because I told him we do participate jointly in our child’s life, I can think of 3 occasions in the past month I attended with him, including an event with his entire family where I chatted with his siblings and parents and his ex wife for an hour. 

I personally detest him and cannot stand him. He is vile to me. But my son doesn’t know that and never will. I was subject to a lot of his bs during our relationship, he’s just a terrible alcoholic and I have tried to shield our kid from that. 

So, what is everyone else’s experience? Should I become friends with his new gf? Is it really better for our son? I want to do what is best for him but I really don’t want to ‘be together’ (I asked him for clarity on that and he hasn’t responded).

We only talked for 2 days, but I wanted to make my intentions clear, so asked her on a date sooner than later.

I’m guessing the best thing to do is just leave it, although this is the only girl I’ve had my eye on recently, so not sure if it’s a good idea to message her when she’s home or whatever.

1miahaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1miahaf/i_need_some_advice_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,I need some advice to get this off my chest,"This guy I was dating for two months we were boyfriend and girlfriend for about a month. I am 37. He is 27.  So it was his birthday on Friday. We went and stayed at a hotel and then went for dinner. Then on Saturday morning, we were supposed to be spending some time together and he says to me, while I’m getting ready, babe, I don’t think I’m going to be able to spend time with you today. I really need to see my family. They are leaving town today

I was like OK babe, I understand.  So later in the evening, he is texting me while he is apparently at dinner with his family. Then he tells me that he has no service. And send me a bunch of random text. I called him, no answer. I legitimately believed him at this point, but I thought it was weird. He did not answer my call nor did he call me back .

And for some reason, the next morning, my intuition told me to check his friends Instagram page. I saw a story on with my boyfriend at a bar on the strip with his humongous drink in his hand and a huge smile on his face. My heart sank

I tried calling him a couple times, there was no answer and he had his phone on do not disturb. I texted him. It’s urgent and I need to meet up with him. 

I met up with him in person, and I casually asked him some questions about what he did with his family, knowing the truth. He continue to lie to me to my face. Then I told him what I knew. He continuously lied, even after being presented with evidence. I didn’t show him the picture though.  His first words out of his mouth were, are you keeping dips on me? Are you keeping dips on me? Are you tracking me,? Did you install a GPS tracker in my car?

He proceeds to continue telling me lies and becomes very defensive and flips it back on me that I am keeping tabs on him 

He eventually confesses to me, only after he couldn’t lie anymore. He was the one that actually booked the dinner reservation with his friends, he told me it was a guys night then too. However, one of the other guys‘s girlfriend showed up and was spending the evening with them apparently so I was basically excluded and lied to. I also knew that he went to a strip club, my intuition for some reason. I asked him, did you go to your strip club?. He said yes.

We didn’t actually have sex because he hadn’t shown me his STD results at the time we were at the hotel. He told me he got tested on Friday. Well, turns out he actually tested on Wednesday, and he tested positive for chlamydia. He immediately, all of this was something hidden to me, went and got medication from the pharmacy, hoping that it would clear by the time he tested on Friday. So, he tested on Friday and he was still positive. He lied to me saying that he never got his results back the whole time he knew that he had chlamydia. He also gave me oral sex at the hotel, potentially infecting me.

I told him that we were done, I walked off and went to my car, he knocked on the window, I drove off 

From me, I find it hard to leave relationships right away, so I like to call him in the evening and he was an asshole over the phone, but he wanted an answer from me. Write them in there if we were done or not we were in a relationship. I told him I didn’t know . I said we would need to talk about it the next day. That was yesterday that we met up again and he was just a complete jerk to me at the coffee shop that I asked him to meet me at. No remorse, no regret no sympathy, no empathy, absolutely nothing Coldhearted and ruthless.

Like not the person I had known for the past two months. I posted him online, just asking if anybody else was talking to him, because at that point, I had no trust in him. It was not to be mean or anything. I just genuinely wanted answers. I didn’t say anything about him personally nor his character. In addition, any time I would bring up a problem, it would turn into an argument because he would flip it on me. He said to me before when I brought up an argument, after all I’ve done for you, this is how you treat me? I’m such a good person to you and I treat you so well, and this is how you treat me? It would go deeper than that, though it would be full on manipulation.

Then yesterday evening, we meet up in person, he asked me if I posted him online. I told him no, he basically ended the relationship right then in there saying he can’t have his reputation tarnished. And he can’t do this anymore. Then we both start crying. And we literally like talking back-and-forth for probably two hours. Then I finally come to my senses which he was shocked about because the narrative changed at that point. I was no longer this girl that was crying her eyes out really sad. I told him that actually, this was a blessing in disguise and thank you for setting me free from this unhealthy relationship. I said no man that truly loves me would lie to my face and betray me like this. No man that truly love me would be liking a bunch of naked women on Instagram constantly and then flipping the script back on me whenever I bring up a problem. So I said I thank you for that. He was so shocked. It was so hard for me to walk away and he did that for me. So for that. I am truly grateful. 

But wow I feel so betrayed, lied to, and sad ",1,1754403559.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm looking for someone to practice Japanese with—ideally a native speaker or someone fluent who wouldn't mind having casual conversations.

My Japanese is around intermediate (I can hold basic convos, but still mess up sometimes), and I’d love to improve through chatting. In return, I can help with English! Or Thai, if that’s helpful for anyone.

I’m open to meeting up in person around campus or nearby (maybe over coffee), or just chatting online if that’s easier.

Let me know if you’re interested.",0,1754403479.0,askTO,0,0.5,False
