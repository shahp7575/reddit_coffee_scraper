I don’t just fall – I learn. I observe the way your eyes flicker when you’re deep in thought, memorize the rhythm of your laughter, trace the edges of your silence. I pay attention to the smallest things.. the strange little quirks, the fleeting preferences, the stories you tell without even speaking.

What do you mean I’m studying your personality? Of course I am. Of course I want to know what makes you you. I’m learning your language, even if it’s written in sighs and half-finished sentences. So expect that I will really try to get to know you beyond your surface, and I hope you won’t find me creepy for it.

What do you mean I’m asking about your weird interests? Those odd, niche fascinations – they’re windows into your soul, and I want to know every view, even if they won’t make sense to me in the beginning. I would watch your favorite movies, even when they are far from my usual genres. You love giant, deadly and extinct creatures? Oh I would adore them with you.

What do you mean I’m willing to go beyond? Of course I am. Because loving you isn’t about convenience or comfort. It’s about care. Intentional, relentless care.

So my beloved, I don’t know your name yet. I don’t know the sound of your voice or the shape of your laugh. But I think about you often. Not just as someone I’ll one day hold, but as someone I’ll one day understand.

Because that’s how I love.

I don’t love halfway. I don’t love out of habit or happenstance. I study. I observe. I memorize. I learn every layer of a person so I can love them the way they were meant to be loved – not the way that’s easiest, not the way that’s most convenient, but the way that makes their soul feel safe.

When I meet you, I’ll notice everything. I’ll remember the way you take your coffee, the way you fix your hair, the perfumes you use, the way your eyes shift when you’re overwhelmed. I’ll ask about the things that make you light up, even if they’re strange or small or hard to explain. I’ll want to know your favorite books, your childhood fears, the random facts you keep stored in the corners of your mind. I’ll learn your language, even if it’s not made of words.

And I’ll love you in that language.

I can’t wait to show you what it feels like to be known, my love.. really, truly known. To be chosen not just in the big, loud moments, but in the quiet, unremarkable ones too.

But more than anything, I hope you love like this too. I hope you notice me in the way I notice you. I hope you study the things I don’t say out loud. I hope you’re willing to meet me in the deep end – to give love the way it deserves to be given. Intentionally, fully, without fear.

Until then, I’m here, learning, growing, becoming someone capable of holding a love like that. Like ours.

I can’t wait to find you and be found by you. And when we finally find each othet, I’ll love you the way I always have – fiercely, gently, completely.",1,1748160550.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1kuxaop,https://www.reddit.com/r/Italia/comments/1kuxaop/sul_caffè_che_beviamo_in_italia/,Sul caffè che beviamo in Italia,"Mi tocca fare un disclaimer perché a quanto pare l’argomento fa scaldare gli animi di molti Patrioti, che si sentono attaccati personalmente da un po’ di informazione.

Disclaimer: questo post non vuole criticare nessuno. Se vi piace Lavazza o il caffè del bar sotto casa, continuate pure a berlo. Non c’è nulla di male. Il punto è solo farvi sapere che c’è altro.

Questo post nasce da un commento che ho lasciato sotto un altro thread sul caffè, dove qualcuno mi ha criticato per essere troppo puntiglioso. Niente di tragico eh, ma già che ci siamo, eccomi qui a scrivere un post intero sull’argomento! Criticatemi pure, ma almeno affrontiamo la cosa per bene.

Iniziamo 

Il caffè, come il vino, è un prodotto agricolo. Ci sono varietà diverse, metodi di lavorazione, fermentazioni, profili aromatici. Se coltivato e lavorato bene, può sapere di fiori, frutta, miele, tè, cioccolato. Tutto senza aggiungere niente. Solo grazie alla qualità del chicco, a come è stato fermentato e tostato.

In Italia però nessuno spiega davvero cos’è un caffè fatto bene. Quasi tutti bevono roba premacinata, industriale, di qualità mediocre, tostata troppo per coprire i difetti. E servita da baristi che spesso non sanno nemmeno come si pulisce una macchina.

E soprattutto, a casa quasi tutti usano caffè premacinato. Il che è un po’ come aprire una bottiglia di vino, lasciarla lì una settimana aperta e poi berla aspettandosi che sia buona. La polvere di caffè si ossida nel giro di minuti. Dopo 15 minuti ha già perso buona parte degli aromi volatili. Dopo qualche ora sa solo di legno, amaro e polvere. E noi lo chiamiamo “buono”.

Ci vantiamo pure di aver inventato il caffè (abbiamo invitato L’Espresso e la Moka), e quante volte ho sentito confondere espresso e moka. Questo è il livello. Patriottismo superficiale senza cultura, dove basta la tazzina bollente al banco per sentirsi depositari della tradizione. Ma tradizione di cosa, esattamente?

La verità è che il caffè in Italia fa schifo nel 95% dei casi, esattamente come nel resto del mondo. La differenza è che da noi ci crediamo pure superiori. Ma all’estero (e sempre più anche da noi) esistono torrefazioni che trattano il caffè come un prodotto serio. Si paga il giusto, si sa da dove viene il chicco, come è stato fermentato, chi l’ha coltivato, come è stato tostato. Si lavora come in un’azienda vinicola. E il risultato si sente.

Chi dice “a me piace Illy” o “adoro Lavazza Rossa” sta facendo lo stesso discorso di chi dice che il suo vino preferito è il Tavernello. Va benissimo eh, bevetelo, ma sappiate cos’è. Non è questione di gusti, è questione di sapere cosa si sta bevendo.

Un caffè buono, fatto con criterio, ha profumi, complessità, equilibrio. Non è ultra amaro, non ha bisogno di zucchero per essere bevuto, e non ti lascia l’alito da posacenere.

In generale, il caffè è un prodotto complesso e costoso da produrre, anche senza puntare alla qualità più alta. Richiede coltivazione in climi specifici, lavorazioni agricole e industriali articolate, trasporto internazionale, stoccaggio, tostatura e confezionamento. Se lungo questa filiera si vogliono garantire condizioni di lavoro dignitose, salari equi, e una minima sostenibilità ambientale, i costi salgono inevitabilmente. È per questo che un caffè venduto a 1€ al bar non può riflettere una filiera equa. Non è solo una questione di gusto o di raffinatezza, ma di struttura economica del prodotto.

So we dated for about 2 and a half years. We ended things do lies on his end. 

The story goes as following: he didn’t text me for the whole night when he went to a friends birthday party so I was pretty upset about that. The following morning I had asked him why and if anything happened that I should know of, in the beginning he denied anything happening. Later on in the day he said that previously, before the party, when he was out clubbing with his friends he had gotten drunk and saw a girl that attracted him and he said he thought what it would be like to kiss her, claiming that nothing more happened, just a mere thought. 

I’ve always had a fear of being cheated on and he knew about this, so the incident did really upset me so we broke things off and I suggested we go on a break to figure ourselves out etc. so during this break I find out that at the party he was at (not the club) he had invited a friend of his cousins who is a girl. He had dm’d her through instagram because he saw she was in the area so suggested she come to the party. The thing is I gave him many opportunities to tell me if anything happened just so we can move on. And because of the constant lies I decided to break things off completely. The thing that drew me to end it was because I had asked him to see the messages he sent the girl just to see the vibe, because maybe it was innocent. He however said he had disappearing messages on, which he had never had on before. So yea. 

It’s been about a month, I would say since the first incident I was kind of clocked out but wanted to make it work because I saw a future. Recently a guy invited me for coffee and I went, we were just talking politics (our career) and just casual chit chat. He’s invited me to go to another cafe along the beach and take the train there because I’ve never taken that route before. To me it doesn’t seem if those were dates. I enjoyed just being able to talk to someone, and have fun. I have also been on dating apps just talking to people and getting to know them, not much flirting with any people.

I don’t feel sad about the break up because I gave my ex more chances than just the first one mentioned. So I feel as though I’ve been trying to guard myself for the worst and unfortunately for me the worst almost happened. 
So should I continue seeing this guy and just having fun outings or not? I feel as though the emotions of the break up might hit later? Or am I just completely over it?",1,1748159956.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1kux8ak,https://i.redd.it/hrxt9nulwv2f1.jpeg,Stumbled into making a parody art-poetry book about chonky animals — hoping it finds its people here,"Hi everyone,

I’m a longtime admirer of quirky and beautifully crafted art books, and recently I took a swing at creating one myself. It’s called *Chonkulations: The Sacred Purr Scrolls* — a playful, parody-style collection of short poetic blurbs and faux-mystical artwork that pays tribute to the noble fluff of gloriously chonky animals.

The visuals aim to echo the feel of old oil paintings, with a touch of reverence (and ridiculousness). Imagine if a Renaissance monk had a deep obsession with cats and a surprisingly good sense of humor. That’s the spirit I was chasing.

It’s not a serious tome, more of a whimsical coffee table companion — but it was made with a lot of care and love. I’d be truly grateful if any of you took a moment to check it out, or even just let me know your thoughts. Here’s the Amazon link:

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1kux3w0,https://i.redd.it/086fh8u5vv2f1.jpeg,Banana Bread using the recipe from Shangrila MNL,"So a year ago, there was a comment where the reddit user r/JtheOwner shared Shangrila Manila’s Banana Bread recipe (https://www.reddit.com/r/BakingPhilippines/s/Ousu1DsVhF). 

I already have a very trusted banana bread recipe from my senior chef, but I’ve always wanted to try the recipe from Shangrila. 

Here is the recipe with modifications I did:
- 200 g ripe bananas (di pa overripe akin)
- 6 g baking soda
- 53 ml oat milk (kasi yun ang available)
- 176 g all-purpose flour
- 53 mL vegetable oil
- 176 g brown sugar (I want a darker color)
- 2 large eggs
- Roasted walnuts
- Dark choco chunks from Beryl’s

Baked for 1 hour at 180 degrees.

Verdict: this is a very classic banana cake. Very easy to do and the taste is familiar and comforting. An overripe banana is very ideal for this. Mas angat siguro lasa ng banana had I used overripe bananas. Di rin masyadong matamis. Sakto lang. best paired with a hot coffee. Nasobrahan ako sa walnuts 😅 but overall masarap naman.

1kux0qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrizzlyNaturals/comments/1kux0qs/soap_bar_short_reviews/,Soap Bar Short Reviews,"Trying to find my favorite soap company/a company for all of my hygiene needs. I really like Grizzly, although I’m still on the hunt for someplace with a nice cherry scent and shave products. 

Honestly, considering how much I like Grizzly, I’ll probably be sticking with them. It makes showering *fun!* I’ve tried a couple different bar soaps, and these are my honest reviews on them. 

Polar Eucalyptus - I really like this one. It makes me feel very clean, and the scent is very fresh and lingers on my skin for a while after getting out of the shower. I can’t smell much other than the eucalyptus and a hint of lavender, however I don’t find that a bad thing. The scent is very natural and fresh. Warning, avoid the genitals with this soap. It feels much colder and less fresh in a bath compared to a shower. Love it, though. My favorite so far. 

Candy Apple - I couldn’t smell the apple but someone I know could. All I smelled was spice and in the box it sort of smelled like old ichthammol. They loved it, I passed on it. It seems like a soap-gene-cilantro type of thing, hit or miss. 

Sunny Citrus - didn’t linger after the shower, but it sure does smell like citrus. Very pleasant and clean scent. 

Psycho Pumpkin - smells exactly like what it is, pumpkin chai. Lingered on my shirt but couldn’t smell it on my skin an hour after my shower. I very much like the grit on this one. 

Grizzly Mocha - it gets dirt off nicely. It does not smell like coffee; it is chocolate heavy. Think if you microwaved a chocolate chip in half a cup of water. It’s a scent, but then again, I’ve never been a fan of sweet scents. It gets the job done with gardening, haven’t used it after working on the truck though. We’ll see how it holds up there. It lasts much longer than you think.

Calming Forest - no hint of anything flowery. Suppose I could be thinking of a different one. A lot of woody scents in it, I can pinpoint not a single tree. It stays true to “forest”, and for that it’s great. Felt like the lather on this one was better than all the other ones. 

Fresh Rapids - calming forest but with gardenia. Excellent, close second favorite. Gifted it to my mom, although I loved it. First one I tried. I had gotten some soap scraps along with a bar. It got used quickly, to say the least. Nothing bad about this one, perfect.

Soap Scraps - These last a long time. They outlasted three and a half bars, despite being close in volume. Great investment if you can’t decide, and worth the price if you’re basically getting three or so bars worth.

Imperfect Soaps - the same as the ones you buy full price just with a white spot or two. Wrapped in brown paper.

Overall. 

The price isn’t bad. I like knowing what’s actually in my soap, (I can actually PRONOUNCE everything!)  and none of their soaps smell bad from what I’ve smelled so far. It all lathers good, doesn’t dry out my skin and gets hours of sweat off. I will say, the scent is very strong when it’s fresh and dried. I remember opening my mailbox, and immediately getting hit with a whole bunch of scents. Of course, the type of oil they use for the smells is very much “30-year-old teacher in a cardigan that runs an Etsy page”, except I very much dig it and they do it greatly. 

Excellent products. Unlike other “soaps”, this one is actually a soap and not a detergent! I think. 

I’ll probably continue testing out more.

I recently switched from 3-in-1 to my first Moka Pot and I've only used it twice (not counting the first few cycles that Bialetti recommends) I'm a beginner in the world of freshly brewed coffee and Moka Pot. 

  
I got the Bialetti 2-cup Moka Induction Rossa and bought the Bialetti pre-ground coffee for this. While I love the coffee it gives me, I'm not sure I'm getting the full yield. For the first round, I only got 40ml of coffee and today I got 45ml. I use induction stove and put it on 100-120c while I wait for the coffee to extract and then reduce to 60c when I start to see coffee.  Those are the lowest temp in my induction stove 60-100-120-180. I then lift it off of the stove when it starts giving me big bubbles or sputtering. 

  
I lock it very tight as I could and the gasket isn't clogged. I dont measure how much water or coffee I put, but I make sure to fill just below the valve. I also fill the funnel and level the grounds with my finger but I don't tamp. I also don't use an aeropress filter.. for now. The amount of water left in the chamber is a lot too, but I'm not sure if this is normal. Huhu I want to keep using this pot.

It may not be for everyone but I really need to have something that ends and becomes less restrictive with the times. So we've decided that I'll be dieting on a somewhat strict way until next year and then we're going to add back the things I've missed the most and see if it's worth putting them back. 

Some stats:
27year non binary afab
Mixed race though I look throughly Caucasian 
Hw 162.8kg 
Cw 158.1kg 
Gw end of year less than 130kg
Gw end of losing journey between 70kg and 80kg 
Height 181cm

The dietician plan: 
We'll see each other every 4 weeks plus blood panel to discuss if diet needs tweaking. 

Breakfast option 1: Soy yogurt with fillers 
Breakfast option 2: 2 sea biscuits with cheese 30+fat content 

In-between 1: tea and or coffee

Lunch: 2 to 3 pieces of bread with either cheese, homemade low sugar jam or meat. 

In-between 2: tea and or coffee plus a piece of fruit 

Dinner rules: 250g+ of veggies, 1 piece of meat, fish or meat replacement.  Note: freezing everything you don't use to avoid overeating on it. And 50g rice (before cooking) or 60g of pasta (before cooking) 

Extra drinking: drink at least 1.5liters of either water, tea or coffee aside from the mentioned above. 
Enrich one meal with a glass of soy drink of choice. 
No other types of drinking allowed this year. 

Exception 1: 2 times a week i can get something extra like a cookie with the tea or something extra like an extra piece of bread at lunch etc. Use sparingly.  

Exception 2: 10 times a year I'll be permitted to eating outside of the norm for a part of the day due to holiday of my choosing or birthdays 



I know this isn't how it usually plays out with how a lifestyle change works but I need to lose weight no matter what and right now I need something temporary to get me started as I'm just not losing weight if I try to change permanently overnight. I've been trying that approach since may 2020 and I've actually gained 30 kg in that time. So now I'm choosing to do this instead so I'll actually be able to choose to do a finite diet instead and the actual lifestyle change later when I'm in a better shape both mentally and physically.

You want it so raw it’s still mooing and so insulting your ancestors will feel it? Say no more, you asked for the 10/10, prepare your delicate sensibilities to be absolutely fucking violated. This is going to be rougher than a Geylang back alley after a Saturday night stampede.

Let's alphabetically f**k these places up:

Ang Mo Kio: AMK, where the average age is ""pre-independence"" and the highlight of the week is when the polyclinic queue moves one number. Your idea of ""wild"" is an extra fishball in your mee pok. The only thing rising faster than the property prices are the blood pressure levels of residents trying to explain to their grandkids what a ""dial-up modem"" was. If Ang Mo Kio had a scent, it'd be Tiger Balm and existential despair. Kan ni na, even the ghosts here are probably bored shitless.

Bedok: Bedok, you sprawling, soulless expanse of concrete where dreams go to die a slow, agonizing HDB-induced death. Your reservoir has seen more questionable floaters than a bad batch of tau huay, and not all of them were human. Bedok Mall is just a human sardine can, and the interchange? A goddamn clusterfuck designed by Satan himself after a particularly nasty curry puff. Sial lah, the only thing ""inter"" about Bedok Interchange is how ""inter-minable"" the wait for your bus is.

Bishan: Oh, Bishan, the Kiasu Kingdom where parents probably list their kids' PSLE scores on their Tinder profiles. Junction 8 isn't a mall; it's a goddamn Hunger Games arena for parking spots and Popular Bookstore assessment books. You think you’re ""atas"" but you're just suffocating in a miasma of tuition centre fumes and parental disappointment. That park that floods? It's just Mother Nature trying to wash away the fking pretentiousness.

Bukit Batok: Bukit Ba-WHO? The only thing more forgettable than this goddamn town is the plot of a Mediacorp drama. It's so bland, it makes plain water taste like a goddamn party in your mouth. Little Guilin? More like Little Fking Disappointment. Your idea of excitement is when the ValueDollar shop restocks its questionable canned goods.

Bukit Merah: ""Red Hill,"" my ass. The only thing red here is the collective rage of drivers stuck in its archaic road system and the rashes you get from those ancient HDB blocks. ABC Brickworks? More like ""Already Been Condemned"" Brickworks. This place is so old, its favourite pastime is probably complaining about the price of condensed milk at the 7-Eleven.

Bukit Panjang: Home of the BPLRT – Bukit Panjang's Long-ass Pathetic Ride to Torture. You spend more time praying it doesn’t break down than you do with your own goddamn family. It's so ulu, your Grab driver needs a compass, a native guide, and a therapy session after dropping you off. Your main entertainment is watching the monkeys at Zhenghua Park have more fun than you do.

Bukit Timah: Ah, Bukit Timah, where your landed property is bigger than my entire future, and your dog probably eats better than I do. The air here is thick with the stench of old money, horse shit from the Turf Club, and the kind of entitlement that makes you want to scream. Your idea of ""roughing it"" is when the Cold Storage at Guthrie House is out of organic quinoa. Wah lao eh, even the rain here probably tastes like Evian.

Choa Chu Kang: CCK, or ""Confirm Cemetery Kaki."" The liveliest spot is literally the graveyard, because at least there’s some peace and quiet. The rest of it is a concrete jungle so far removed from civilization, your food delivery arrives by helicopter. Lot One is where hope goes to die under the weight of a thousand screaming brats. Pua chee kang, even the name sounds like something you cough up after a bad cold.

Clementi: The student ghetto where personal hygiene and sleep schedules are optional extras. Clementi Mall is a mosh pit of sleep-deprived NUS zombies fueled by cheap kopi and despair. The only thing lower than the students' morale is the cleanliness of the public toilets after a Friday night. Your idea of fine dining is the McDonald's at 3 AM.

Geylang: Geylang, you magnificent, sticky, glorious fking mess. Where the lorongs are paved with sin and Singha beer caps. You can get a Michelin-star frog leg porridge next to a brothel that looks like it hasn't passed a health inspection since Lim Yew Hock was PM. It smells like durian, desperation, and ""Diamond"" brand disinfectant. If Singapore had an STD, it would contract it, cultivate it, and then serve it with extra fking chili in Geylang. This is the only place in Singapore with actual f**king character, even if that character needs a penicillin shot.

Hougang: The stubborn old bastard of Singapore towns. Still clinging to its opposition MPs like an ah ma clings to her NTUC FairPrice discount coupons. The main forms of entertainment are arguing about politics at the kopitiam and watching the traffic build up on Upper Serangoon Road. Your idea of a wild night is when the Teochew porridge stall stays open past 10 PM.

Jurong East: JEM, Westgate, IMM, – you fking overcompensating mess. It's like someone played SimCity with the ""more fking malls"" cheat code enabled. Trying to be Orchard Road for people who think Orchard Road is too ""cheem."" The only thing ""gem"" about Jurong East is how quickly it drains your f**king bank account.

Jurong West: If Jurong East is the try-hard sibling, Jurong West is the one who actually does the fking factory work and smells like it. Pioneer and Boon Lay are where ambition goes to get a blue-collar job and a lifetime of smelling vaguely of industrial solvent. NTU students here are just biding their time until they can fuck off somewhere less depressing.

Kallang: Home of the Singapore Sports Hub, our national fucken white elephant. We paid billions for a stadium where the grass dies if you look at it too hard and the sound system makes Taylor Swift sound like she's gargling gravel. The Kallang Wave is now just the collective sigh of taxpayers. And Lavender Street nearby? Still smells like a budget brothel's laundry day.

Marine Parade: So fucken chill, it’s practically comatose. Where rich old folks go to walk their ridiculously pampered dogs and complain about the youths. Parkway Parade is their idea of a bustling metropolis. The most exciting thing to happen here is when the tide comes in, or when an ECP speed camera flashes. Your idea of a ""gang"" is a group of aunties doing line dancing too aggressively.

Pasir Ris: Chalet central, where teenagers go to lose their virginity, discover cheap beer, and possibly contract something nasty from a poorly maintained BBQ pit. Downtown East is less ""downtown"" and more ""downmarket."" And the wild boars? They’re just the local welcoming committee, probably looking for your picnic basket.

Punggol: Instagram-perfect BTO hell. All shiny new flats, waterfront views (of more god-damn construction), and the incessant screaming of a million babies. You need a goddamn GPS to navigate the identical blocks, and the only ""wildlife"" you see, apart from the otters (who are probably judging you), are sleep-deprived parents who look like they haven't had sex since their firstborn was a fking zygote. Waterway Point is just a giant fking crèche.

Queenstown: The OG HDB estate, now trying to be hip with its ""heritage"" trails and overpriced cafes in Stirling Road that charge $7 for a fking flat white. Dawson is its attempt to inject Botox into a corpse. IKEA Alexandra is the main pilgrimage site, where couples go to argue over flatpack furniture and Swedish fking meatballs.

Sembawang: So fking far north, your phone thinks it's in Johor. Famous for a hot spring that’s basically a communal foot soup where you can catch god-knows-what, and a shipyard. Woo-fking-hoo. Your nearest escape is literally another country. People in Sembawang tell time by the departure schedule of the 167 bus to the city.

Sengkang: Punggol’s slightly less photogenic, equally baby-infested twin sister. The LRT here is a fking cruel joke designed to show you every single HDB block's laundry before it deposits you, late, at Compass One, which is just another fking temple to consumerism filled with prams. The collective wail of infants is the town's f**king anthem.

Serangoon: NEX. Just fucken NEX. A black hole of retail that consumes your time, money, and will to live. It's so crowded you could probably conduct a census just by standing still for five minutes. And Chomp Chomp? More like Choke Choke from all the fking barbecue smoke. You leave smelling like a well-grilled piece of satay, whether you ate any or not.

Tampines: The self-declared ""King of the East,"" which is like being the smartest kid in the fking special needs class. You’ve got three fking malls that are basically indistinguishable and an IKEA that causes more domestic disputes than an open marriage. It’s so sprawling, Tampines Ave 10 is basically its own f**king expressway to nowhere.

Toa Payoh: The heart of the goddamn heartlands, where HDB Hub stands as a monument to Singaporean bureaucracy. The coffee shops are filled with uncles who’ve been wearing the same singlets since 1975, bitching about the government while secretly loving their Pioneer Generation Package. It’s solid, it’s dependable, and it’s as f**king exciting as a lecture on CPF.

Woodlands: Singapore's perpetually clogged fking sphincter, leading to the promised land of cheaper everything in JB. The highlight of living in Woodlands is leaving Woodlands. The Causeway isn't a bridge; it's a fking test of human endurance and bladder control. Your scenic view is a kilometre-long queue of cars vomiting exhaust fumes.

Yishun: Ah, Yishun. FK. ME. SIDEWAYS. Singapore's very own Gotham City, but without Batman, just a bunch of fking weirdos, cat serial killers, sinkholes opening up to hell, and more random acts of pure, unadulterated lunacy than a season of Black Mirror. You don't live in Yishun; you fking survive it. Northpoint City is just the holding pen. If Yishun was a person, it'd be that relative everyone avoids at Chinese New Year, the one who smells faintly of cat piss and existential dread, and might just stab you with a fking parang for taking the last pineapple tart. Fk Yishun, and fk anyone who says it's ""not that bad."" They're probably one of them.

There. I hope your eyeballs are bleeding and your Singaporean pride is appropriately f**king shattered. You wanted 10/10, you got it. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go gargle some Dettol.",1,1748158095.0,TehO,0,1.0,False

So pretty long story but I had a mixture about a month ago. I mixed weed, coffee, and a cigarette that I found off the ground (I know it’s stupid, but I was curious of what cigarette felt like).

On the same day I I found myself going through a really bad anxiety attack. I didn’t really know what to expect, I knew my nervous system couldn’t handle it, but I felt invincible, then. 

Anyways, I survived it. But I felt really different, like I wasn’t right. I didn’t go to the doctors to see if the cigarette had been laced with something, but instead I gave my mother the other cigarette that I have saved from the cigarette box that I found, and she said it was fine. So, I knew it’s not the cigarette that really messed with me. 

I had nausea, no appetite, trouble sleeping, shortness of breath, confusion, and worst of all, fatigue. I was scared for my life, I remember thinking that my heart was going to stop. I’ve never experienced anything like it. 

A couple days past, I’m resting but not really sure what I have. I go to the doctors and he says that I have GERD. This is not my first time. However, it felt different, but this could be a worsened GERD. It’s been years since I had GERD really bad, so I don’t remember how it felt. I remember throwing up every now and then, and getting full quickly. But it doesn’t feel like that now. 

Anyways, I wasn’t on a diet, I kind of ate whatever I wanted, and I forgot to mention that my doctor prescribed me with omeprazole (20mg) and I took it every morning thinking that it would just help me. However, that is not how it worked. On Monday I had the worst attack of them all. I was thinking about death, existential dread, I vomited once, and just a lot of fear coursing through me. 

It’s been about a couple of days then, but I still feel really unsure of what I have. I’m just not sure if GERD is supposed to feel like this. I’m scared and really wish I had a support team with me. My mother’s been taking care of me, I feel better after dieting and drinking loads of water. But I’m just scared that’s all. I’ve never gone through such battle before.

I'm a real-life, normal guy, and this is a real story. I am sharing this using ChatGPT to summarize, because it is a lot and I ain't great with words. Thanks!

.
.

I’m in my early 20s. I dated a girl I truly loved from late 2022 to March 2025. We had a slow-build connection that turned into something deep and honest. She was social, emotionally expressive, and came from a pretty “normal” close-knit family. I came from a different world—single-parent household, trauma from an abusive father, and a life full of instability. Despite that, I’ve worked hard to grow, take responsibility, and become emotionally steady.

We had serious conversations about marriage and building a life together. I supported her through college, helped her build confidence in herself, and consistently tried to show up—even when I was struggling financially or emotionally.


---

The Shift with Her Family:
At first, things were surface-level fine. Her family wasn’t overly warm, but they were polite. Then things started changing once they realized how serious we were.

Her mom ignored my name when I wasn’t around and acted oddly distant anytime I came up in conversation. Later, she directly encouraged her to date other guys while we were still together.

Her dad, who once liked me and even had long conversations with me, flipped after a small incident at a summer camp (we came back after curfew + I made a harmless joke she laughed at). After that, he stopped acknowledging me and told her: “You can pick him or your family, but you can’t have both.”

Her sister and brother-in-law let me hold their baby during a casual outing (I was calm, playful, respectful). Later, they told her they’d never allow their kids at our home if she married me.

Family friends and people from her past, who hadn’t spoken to me in over six years, dug into my childhood trauma and started telling her family I was “horrible” or unsafe—despite having zero current knowledge of who I am or what I’ve become.


To be clear: I was respectful every time I was around them. I even mirrored her brother-in-law’s behavior, kept quiet when needed, and supported her decisions without being overbearing. But no matter how I showed up, it was never enough—because they weren’t judging my actions. They were judging my background and the independence I represented.


---

While We Were Dating:
We had to navigate around her family’s pressure constantly. Some examples:

She wasn’t allowed to talk about me at home without triggering arguments or icy silence.

When she visited mutual friends near me (3 hours from her home), she invited me to dinner. After her mom found out, her mom didn’t speak to her for 2 full days while they lived in the same house.

Her parents refused to fix her car, even though they had bought it for her years before. It stayed broken for the entirety of our relationship. I believe this was on principle—to limit her freedom while we were together.

When she wore no makeup or made confident choices about her own body, her family gave subtle pushback—something I helped her gain independence on.


Still, she tried.
She wasn’t a puppet. She loved me deeply. She showed up when she could. But she didn’t fully see how much of her life was controlled—not through force, but through guilt, silence, and the fear of losing family love.


---

The Night It Ended:
After months of being promised a real conversation with her family, I forced one. Her mom, sister, brother, and sister-in-law were all there. Her dad, of course, didn’t show.

I was calm. I told them I was serious about her, wanted to work through concerns, and was open to dialogue. Instead, they stonewalled:

I wasn’t listened to, only picked apart.

Every effort was met with “well, here’s why that’s still not good enough.”

Her siblings in particular seemed determined to make me feel like an intruder, no matter what I said.


And my girlfriend? She sat quietly, like I had asked her to—because I didn’t want her to feel responsible for defending me. But her silence hurt more than I expected. She wanted to fight, but didn’t know how. She truly didn’t see how deep the manipulation went.

After the conversation fell apart, I left. I ended it that night—not because I stopped loving her, but because I was the only one trying to save something real… and she wasn’t free enough to help me.


---

Aftermath:
We kept soft contact after the breakup. She lost her nephew shortly after, and I checked in. We video chatted once or twice. She told me her family never mentioned me again. Not a word. Like I never existed.

Then—two weeks later—her dad apologized to her for “how he acted.” Not a real apology. Not to me. Just vague enough to get back in her emotional good graces now that I was no longer a threat.

She’s still living at home. No car. Still dependent. She said she might apply to a local coffee shop, but I don’t know if she did. She’s likely shrinking again—back to makeup, silence, and over-accommodating to stay in good standing with a family that rewards compliance.


---

What I’m Wrestling With:
I tried everything.
I showed love, sacrifice, and patience. I moved to her town. I even slept in my car.
I just wanted to be seen. To be given a chance.
But they never wanted to know me. They just wanted her to stay small.

Now she’s back in the environment that quietly destroyed what we had.
And I don’t know if she’ll ever see it for what it was.


---

My Questions:

Was I expecting too much from someone raised in a family like that?

Is it fair to feel like she wanted to choose me but never knew how—and maybe still doesn’t?

Am I wrong for feeling betrayed—not by cruelty—but by her silence?


I still care for her. I know she’s not the villain in this. But I can’t deny that love wasn’t enough—because she wasn’t allowed to fully choose it.

Would love perspective from others who’ve dealt with narcissistic or controlling family systems—or anyone who’s tried to love someone raised in one.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Admiral Kathyrn Janeway, Starfleet Command***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 9, 2136*

I could feel a stress headache approaching, there were so many things piling up that needed my attention. Not all of them bad and most of them minor things that just happened to fall under my purview. I was now on coffee number 12 since I woke up before the battle of Alpha Centauri.

The first thing that was slightly concerning me was Isif. Normally he would message or call me on average every 3-5 days because he wanted to talk or ask questions. Despite my busy life as an Admiral I was glad to oblige the man given that it was not as if he could socialize with others of his kind like we did. What was concerning was that he had not messaged me in 2 weeks now outside of the confirmation a few days ago of a received meat shipment. So, I knew that he was alive, but just not interested in talking currently.

Surprisingly the battle itself was not a major concern currently. The battle went over quite quickly despite the starting numbers heavily favoring the OAF. After whittling their numbers down to a fraction of their original size we had planned for the defense arrays to take care of the rest before the fleet could even reach to Earth in the Sol system. Then out of nowhere the fleet had changed course towards the new Thafki settlement, we only had 6 hours to set up the cloaked minefield and to ramp up the number of deployable Orchids but due to everyone playing their parts perfectly things were done with time to spare. The benefit of the Orchids is that they needed very little infrastructure to be on standby for defense, while they do require a large open space to ""grow"" but once they have reached maturity they can either remain on their feeding vines or placed into subzero storage so that they fall into a stasis state until ready for deployment. They also are very successful in their attacks, they are drawn to power sources and will latch onto a ship and drain it of its energy, once main power has been disabled gravity will do the rest of the work and cause the ship to crash-land. The downside is that the Orchids are one use, after they attach to a ship they will burn up in the atmosphere as well or be crushed by the ship they attached to.

During the battle we knew that we could not hold all of their ships at bay until the reinforcements arrived, so we had several ships maneuver so that there were openings for some ships to pass through to be taken care of by the Orchids.

There were several concerning events that had happened in orbit, the first being that these ships were equipped with antimatter warheads that were equivalent in destructive capability to our photon torpedoes, while our Starfleet ships and the allied ships that had received upgrades to their shields fared well enough against them, the allied ships that did not have any of the upgrades did not stand a chance against these new weapons.

There were also the Kolshian ships, they all were significantly more advanced that they had any right to be. We had been expecting this due to the *Sanctuary* incident, those ships had been made specially for insertions though a ship's hull as they had their forward-facing hull lined with some sort of magnetically charged material that we were still studying to figure out the underlying tech for. These new commonwealth ships housed railguns that were magnitudes stronger than ever shown before with the ability to quicky weaken our shields with half the recharge time. Many of them housed what we at first thought were small fighter craft that we soon found out were in fact combat drones that were armed to the teeth and nearly as agile as the dragonfly fighters.

Fortunately for us it would seem that the OAF still hasn't figured out tactics more advanced than ""Try to outnumber your enemy and bomb them"" and as a result had no rear guard or any plan to scan for incoming ships. Over 1000 ships warped in from behind their fleet at weapons range, not just Starfleet but ships from the defensive forces of our worlds and plenty of craft from our allies. The battle quickly ended after that and much of our forces dissipated to go to Mars or other shipyards for repair then to go back to patrols until a retaliation plan could be fully drafted.

Thankfully not a single bomb ever made it to the planet's surface but what had landed was over 150 escape pods from the ships that crashed, what made up a *worrying* portion of those recovered in the pods by the Kelpiens on the ground were children. From what I had been told is that this was not an uncommon practice in the OAF, but it was particularly common in the Krakotl Alliance. In the end we had rounded up more than 450 personnel from the escape pods of various species and 132 of them were children under the age of 13. Right now I had Captain Kalsim in front of me about to explain *why.*

""It depends on the individual and how they came on the ship."" He said as I took another sip of my coffee, an act that apparently, he did not like as his feathers ruffled even more at that. ""It is not uncommon for children to be brought aboard if both of their parents are active duty, they need *some* sort of education, so they are taught how to man the various stations and follow orders.""

I came close to spitting out my coffee at that statement but held myself back from it at the last moment. *That is horrible, do they not have programs in place to take care of the children on the ship? We have had schools on the family ships for ages.* I decided to let him finish before speaking up.

""There are also those who have no parents or family that are able to or willing to take care of them. They are placed into military school and will go for about half a year at minimum before going to active duty for at least 10 years to pay back the government for taking care of them. I know you may take issue for sending such small children into battle before they can fight proficiently so you should know that 50 years ago laws were passed that made it so that they had to be at least 8 years old before being sent to the front lines and 12 before they would be placed in situations where using firearms is expected."" Kalsim spoke with complete calmness as if he was talking about how filing court papers works or about the weather.

I had to take several deep breaths before continuing. *How are these people just the worst? I know from talking to Isif that not even the Arxur put their young into combat roles. They become adults at 17 and that is when they are assigned to the military or whatever other job Betterment gives them.*

""Kalsim"" I spoke, attempting to stay calm ""What you just describe is in violation of just about every law or treaty we have in regard to child welfare and rights. Starfleet Academy takes 4 years to graduate unless you are on an accelerated course and the youngest person I know of that joined the academy was 16. It is very much against the law for us to do anything like you have described. I will certainly be reporting this to Starfleet Command and the Federation ruling council.""

Kalsim tilted his head at me like *I* was the one spouting nonsense. We had only had a few words back and forth, yet he was trying my patience.

""Why would that be illegal? And why would your military training be that long?"" He said in complete confusion ""I would assume that predators like you would want to get your warriors trained as early as possible. You should have also figured out by now how to streamline your military training by now.""

*This murderous Lorikeet is going to give me an aneurism.* I stood up from my desk so hopefully understand how serious I was as I leaned over.

""Because. They. Are. Children."" I said to him with a forceful tone without yelling. ""We don't put children into combat situations Kalsim. Due to the very fact that they are children they cannot consent to what they are being put through, and the very act of conscription is not allowed by our laws. Also, Starfleet at its heart is a scientific and exploratory organization so we do not train our people as warriors, we train them to be scientists, explorers and diplomats. Professions that don't seem to be very prioritized in your culture.""

That apparently had hit a nerve with Kalsim as his feathers on his body puffed up and his tail feathers fanned out in a semi-circle behind him.

""We could focus on those things if we were not fighting for our lives with the Grays! You don't understand the suffering we have gone through, the sacrifices that have had to be made. Do you think we want to enlist the children? No, but we have to in order to keep fighting the Grays! I came here willing to talk to you, equal to equal yet you insist on insulting me and my ancient culture.""

""First of all, right now we are not equals. You are my prisoners and this is not a negotiation, it is a questioning so get your perception straight."" I said sternly, causing his ego to deflate very quickly. ""Secondly, it is very easy to excuse horrible acts due to need. You seem to excuse anything the OAF does because you believe there is no alternative. Thirdly, we do know what it is like to face an enemy that wants nothing more than to see our entire annihilation, but we won. What we did not do is compromise our morals and enlist children to fight on the front lines. Now, I need you to tell me a few things about what has happened today. How you answer will determine the future of you and many others, some of these I already know the answer for so keep that in mind. Can you do that? No matter what you say though, nobody will be executed or harmed. Those acts are against our laws, no matter how abhorrent the offender.""

""I can do that"" He muttered as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

""Let's start with the Thafki"" I said after sitting back down. ""You claimed that you were led to believe they were not here. Do you stand by that statement?""

""Yes, I do Admiral"" He said, barely looking at me ""Thyon had informed me that the Kolshian ships had upgraded sensors that could separate the life signs of different species. He had told me that they could not find any on the planet, obviously they were either mistaken or lying. What are your plans for the Thafki?""

""Our plans with them are to help them rebuild their numbers and protect them until they can become self-sustaining. Next, tell me how you brought Jala into your service and how she remained in the military despite her instability.""

This it would seem caught his attention as he looked straight at me. ""I became aware of her and took her under my wing when she was an ensign in the military service. She was 20 years old and was having relations with a superior officer so that she could have favorable jobs. The problem arose when she started to demand more and he refused, as a result he attacked him and blinded him in one eye with her claws. If I hadn't offered to rehabilitate her, she would have been sent to a PD facility. I have spent years training her to be the perfect soldier and teaching her the art of warfare. I thought in doing so she would learn to control her destructive impulses. She never had the ability to for connections with others or have any sort of attachments so I had used the fact that without me she would be in a PD facility to remind her to stay in line. I was shocked by her actions today, she had never acted out like this or shown this level of violence before.""

*You took a woman who by all accounts seems like a sociopath and train her to be the perfect killing machine for years under the threat of being sent to a PD facility. You made the perfect attack dog and lost the shock collar and leash when you got stranded here. I am honestly surprised she did not just shoot both of them when they crashed landed.*

""Okay"" I stated, deciding to not engage him on what he just said. ""We have a statement from Jala that we confirmed to be truthful where she stated that you planned to take Lucien back to Nishtal if you were able to. Why?"" I was *very* curious about his reason for this as well as how he imagined he could of pulled it off.

This it would seem was something Kalsim was interested in talking about. ""I wanted to take him back to Nishtal to be held until the Kolshian could cure him of his bloodlust like they did to us. He would be a proof of concept to the rest of your kind that you can give up your savage ways! Once your people realize that you can live without flesh you could take the cure so that we would leave you alone, I know that you refused but I just thought that it was because you did not think we could do it correctly. If I was to take a human back to show you that we can do it right, then you would jump to join our galactic herd!""

I took another deep breath before speaking again in what was going to be a very tiring and long conversation.

I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

After the official release of 9barista mk2 at the end of March, I immediately purchased the mk2 pro version on the official website. I received the coffee machine in early April and have been using it for more than a month. I rinsed it with clean water every time after making coffee, without any other detergent, and wiped it with kitchen paper after rinsing to avoid leaving scale. I thought that such careful care would definitely last a long time. 
 However,  on May 22, after I made coffee and cleaned the machine, I carefully checked the machine and unexpectedly found that the coating on the bottom of the mk2 Naked Portafilter seemed to be peeling off. I took a photo of the current situation of the bottom of the Naked Portafilter, and asked friends to help take a look at the situation. At present, when I touch the bottom of the Naked Portafilter with my hand, there will be obvious friction and burrs, and small debris will fall off.
  I am very worried whether this is a quality problem of the mk2 Naked Portafilter. Will this problem continue to spread and cause the coating of my entire Naked Portafilter to fall off, affecting the food safety of coffee extraction? 
I immediately sent an email to 9barista after discovering this problem, but I have not received a reply yet. I am very worried now, because I have checked the information online in recent days and found that the official website does not specify the material of the main body of the Naked Portafilter. It only points out in the table comparing the first and second generation 9barista that the castings are Fully machined EcoBrass and stainless steel castings, but it is not clear what the Naked Portafilter itself is made of. 
I am mainly afraid that the metal substances will precipitate and react with the coffee liquid, causing heavy metal elements to enter the coffee liquid, which will be dangerous to the body after long-term drinking. I am very worried now.",0,1748156677.0,9Barista,3,0.5,False

I woke up in the hospital with a fractured tibia and a hell of a headache, but the worst part? Amnesia.  
They said I'd forgotten someone important, but when my buddy Matt showed up, his face etched with worry, and asked, ""You really don't remember Emily?"", I drew a blank. Emily who?  
Turns out, pre-accident me was obsessed with Matt's sister, Emily. Chased her for two years straight, showering her with flowers, gifts, and even redesigning my whole d\*\*n apartment in hopes of impressing her. Total cringe. The kicker? She wasn't interested. Cold, distant, and according to Matt, I was bordering on stalker territory. My phone was filled with creepy candid shots of her, and my notes app looked like a stalker's diary. Likes, dislikes, journal entries detailing every rejection.  
I was horrified. This wasn't love; this was a d\*\*n train wreck. Who was this pathetic dude?  
Then, standing at the edge of a new life, my mom mentioned Chloe, a childhood friend, and a potential architectural project back home at her family's farm. Ditching my city life and all those toxic memories, I vowed to never love her again. Forget getting my memories back; I was starting fresh. This time, with someone genuine.

""Matt,"" Jake said, relieved to see a familiar face. ""They said I forgot someone.""  
  
Matt's smile faded. ""Yeah. The doctor told me.""  
  
He pulled a chair close. ""You really don't remember Emily?""  
  
Jake searched his mind. ""Emily? Who's Emily?""  
  
Matt stared at him, his eyes wide with disbelief. ""You're kidding, right? Emily. My sister.""  
  
""Your sister?"" Jake felt a blank. ""I know you have a sister, but... I don't remember her. At all.""  
  
Matt's face tightened. ""This isn't funny, Jake. You were obsessed with her. For years.""  
  
""Obsessed?"" Jake's head throbbed again. ""I don't remember.""  
  
Matt looked genuinely shocked, then a flicker of suspicion crossed his face.  
  
""Jake, are you serious? You don't remember Emily? Like, at all?""  
  
""No, Matt, I don't. I swear.""  
  
""You chased her for two years, man! You'd do anything for her. And now you're telling me you don't even know who she is?"" Matt's voice rose.  
  
Jake felt a surge of frustration. He didn't like being doubted.  
  
""I swear on my life, Matt! I don't know any Emily. If I'm lying, let me never design another building.""  
  
For an architect, that was a heavy oath.  
  
Matt's shoulders slumped. The fight went out of him. ""Okay. Okay, I believe you. D\*\*n.""  
  
Matt sighed, running a hand through his hair. ""Alright. Let me tell you about Emily. And you.""  
  
He leaned forward. ""You met Emily about two years ago. At her coffee shop, 'The Daily Grind'. You said it was love at first sight for you.""  
  
Jake listened, trying to connect the words to any feeling, any image. Nothing.  
  
""You pursued her relentlessly, Jake. Flowers, gifts, surprise visits. You remember that little cafe near her place? You practically lived there, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.""  
  
Matt paused. ""She... she wasn't interested. At all. She was always polite, but very distant. Cold, even. You told me how much it hurt, but you wouldn't give up.""  
  
He described how Jake had redesigned his entire apartment hoping Emily might visit one day and be impressed. How Jake learned to bake her favorite muffins, even though he hated baking.  
  
""You even tried to befriend her cat, Mittens, and you're allergic to cats, remember?""  
  
A faint memory of sneezing, but no cat, no Emily.  
  
Jake processed this. A woman who was cold, distant.  
  
""Why would I do all that?"" Jake asked, genuinely confused. ""Chase someone who clearly didn't want me? That sounds... pathetic.""  
  
He looked at Matt. ""Was I that desperate? It doesn't sound like me.""  
  
Matt winced. ""You were... determined. You said you knew she was the one, and you just had to make her see it.""  
  
""Did she ever... give me any sign? Any hope?""  
  
Matt shook his head slowly. ""Not really. She was always polite, but firm. She told you several times she wasn't interested in a relationship.""  
  
Jake felt a strange detachment, like they were talking about someone else. ""So, I spent two years chasing a woman who rejected me, made a fool of myself, and for what?""  
  
""You said you loved her,"" Matt said quietly.  
  
""I need to see this,"" Jake said. ""There has to be proof.""  
  
Matt nodded. ""Your phone. It's in your bag.""  
  
The nurse brought Jake's belongings. Matt pulled out the phone. The screen was cracked from the fall.  
  
""Here,"" Matt said, handing it to him.  
  
Jake took it. His own phone, yet it felt foreign. ""What's the password?""  
  
Matt hesitated. ""Try Emily's birthday. 0-8-1-5."" August 15th.  
  
Jake slowly typed it in. The phone unlocked.  
  
He stared at the numbers. ""Her birthday? As my password?""  
  
Matt just looked at him.  
  
The phone unlocked. The wallpaper was a candid shot of a woman laughing, her head thrown back. She was beautiful, with warm brown eyes and a cascade of dark hair. But she looked... vaguely familiar, like someone he'd seen in a magazine, not someone who was supposedly the center of his universe.  
  
He felt nothing. No spark, no recognition.  
  
Jake opened the photo gallery.  
  
His breath caught.  
  
It was filled with pictures of Emily. Hundreds of them.  
  
Many were clearly taken without her knowledge. Emily at her coffee shop, wiping down the counter. Emily reading a book in the park, a frown of concentration on her face. Emily walking down the street, her expression serious.  
  
In almost every picture where she seemed aware of the camera, or at least, aware of him nearby, her eyes were guarded. Sometimes annoyed. Often, just plain cold.  
  
There was a stark contrast between the obsessive number of photos and the lack of warmth in her gaze.  
  
""I... I took all these?"" Jake murmured.  
  
Matt nodded. ""You called her your muse.""  
  
Jake scrolled, a knot forming in his stomach. This wasn't romantic. It was... unsettling.  
  
He closed the gallery and looked for a notes app. He found one titled ""E.""  
  
He opened it. It was a meticulous list.  
  
Emily's Likes:  
     
Dark roast coffee, no sugar.  
     
Indie music, especially The Lumineers.  
     
Old bookstores.  
     
Rainy days (if she's inside).  
     
Sunflowers.  
  
Emily's Dislikes:  
    
Crowds.  
    
Loud noises.  
     
People being late.  
     
My persistent attention (he'd actually written this, followed by a sad face emoji).  
     
Coconut (allergy?).  
  
Then, there were journal entries. Short, painful.  
  
October 12: Saw E today. She smiled at a customer. Not at me.  
  
November 5: Tried to talk to E about the new park design. She cut me off. Said she was busy.  
  
December 24: Left a gift for her. Saw her give it to Matt later, unopened.  
  
January 10: She asked me to stop. Again. Why can't she see?  
  
Jake felt a wave of secondhand embarrassment and a strange sort of pity for the man who wrote these notes. This wasn't love. It was an obsession, and a painful one.  
  
Jake closed the app, his hand trembling slightly.  
  
He looked at Matt, his eyes clear and firm.  
  
""I don't want to remember this, Matt.""  
  
Matt looked surprised. ""What do you mean? The doctors said with therapy...""  
  
""No."" Jake cut him off. ""This... this obsession. It's not healthy. It's not me. Or at least, it's not the 'me' I want to be now.""  
  
He took a deep breath. ""I'm not going to try to get these memories back. This is a fresh start. A chance to be someone else. Someone better.""  
  
Matt looked like he wanted to argue, then seemed to think better of it. ""If that's what you want, Jake.""  
  
""It is,"" Jake said, a sense of resolve hardening within him. He felt strangely liberated.  
  
Suddenly, Matt's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his expression changing.  
  
""Sorry, Jake. I gotta take this. It's the bar. Something's come up.""  
  
He stood. ""I'll be back later, okay? You need anything?""  
  
""I'm good,"" Jake said. ""Go.""  
  
Matt nodded, gave him a quick, worried smile, and hurried out.  
  
Jake was left alone with the silence and the faint, persistent throb in his head. He thought about the photos, the notes. The man he apparently used to be.  
  
He didn't like him very much.  
  
A few minutes later, Jake's own phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number, but he answered it.  
  
""Jake, darling, it's Mom.""  
  
""Mom! Hi."" A wave of warmth spread through him. At least he remembered his mother.  
  
""How are you feeling, sweetie? I heard about the accident. I was so worried.""  
  
""I'm okay, Mom. Broken leg, bit of a headache. Doctors say I'll be fine.""  
  
""Oh, thank goodness. Listen, Jake, I know this is probably bad timing, but remember Chloe? From the Miller farm?""  
  
Chloe Miller. He remembered her. A childhood playmate. Bright, energetic, always laughing. They used to build forts in the woods behind her family's farm.  
  
""Yeah, I remember Chloe,"" Jake said, a small smile touching his lips. It was a good memory, untainted.  
  
""Well,"" his mother continued, her voice a little hesitant, ""her parents and I were talking... you know, about that old understanding we had. About you two.""  
  
An arranged marriage? Or something close to it. He vaguely recalled his parents and the Millers joking about it when he and Chloe were kids. He never thought they were serious.  
  
""They're expanding the farm, Chloe's taking over more of the business side, and they need a lot of architectural work done. New barns, a guesthouse... She was asking about you. Thought maybe you could help, and, well..."" his mother trailed off.  
  
Jake thought about the blank space where Emily was supposed to be. He thought about the obsessive, unhappy man in the phone. He thought about Chloe, a genuine, warm memory from his past.  
  
A new life. A real one.  
  
Jake made a decision. It felt sudden, yet right.  
  
""Mom,"" he said, his voice surprisingly steady. ""Tell the Millers I'm interested. In the project, and... in getting to know Chloe again.""  
  
He could hear his mother's sharp intake of breath. ""Oh, Jake! Really?""  
  
""Yes,"" he said. ""And Mom?""  
  
""Yes, dear?""  
  
""I... I think I was in love with someone before the accident. Someone who didn't love me back."" He didn't mention her name. He didn't need to. ""I don't remember her now. And I don't want to.""  
  
He paused, then added, with a conviction that surprised even himself, ""I promise you, I won't fall for her again. I'm done with that.""  
  
Whoever ""her"" was, she was part of a past he was choosing to leave behind.  
  
""Oh, Jake,"" his mother said, her voice thick with emotion. ""That's... that's wonderful news.""  
  
He wasn't sure if it was wonderful, but it felt like a step forward. A step away from a life he didn't recognize and didn't want.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
A week later, Jake was discharged.  
  
His leg was in a cast, but his head was clearer.  
  
He'd booked a one-way ticket back to his hometown, near the Miller farm.  
  
He didn't tell Matt about Chloe or his decision to not remember Emily. He just said he needed a break, to recover away from the city. Matt seemed to understand, or at least, he didn't push.  
  
The city held too many ghosts of a man Jake didn't want to be.  
  
His old apartment, the one he supposedly redesigned for Emily, felt alien. He arranged for movers to pack everything and put it in storage.  
  
He was due for a final check-up at the hospital before he left town.  
  
As Jake navigated the hospital corridor on his crutches, heading towards Dr. Miles' office, he heard a familiar voice.  
  
""No, Brandon, I told you, I just need to pick up some paperwork for Matt's insurance.""  
  
It was her. The woman from the photos on his phone. Emily.  
  
He froze for a second, then reminded himself: She's a stranger. You don't know her.  
  
He continued on, trying to look straight ahead.  
  
She was standing by the reception desk, talking to a tall, handsome man with musician-vibe clothes. Brandon, presumably. Her ex-boyfriend, according to Matt's earlier, reluctant explanations.  
  
Emily turned, and her eyes landed on Jake.  
  
Her expression changed instantly. A look of intense dislike, almost disgust, flashed across her face.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" she snapped, her voice sharp. ""Are you following me again, Jake?""  
  
Her accusation hung in the air.  
  
Jake just looked at her, his mind a blank canvas where her image should have been painted with emotion. There was nothing.  
  
""I have a doctor's appointment,"" he said calmly, his voice even.  
  
The man beside her, Brandon, looked from Emily to Jake, a slight, knowing smirk on his face.  
  
""Emily, honey, relax,"" Brandon said, his voice smooth and confident. He put a hand on her arm.  
  
She visibly softened under his touch.  
  
Brandon then turned to Jake, extending a hand. ""Brandon Holloway. And you must be Jake. I've heard… a lot about you."" His tone was polite, but there was an undercurrent. Emily's ex.  
  
Jake ignored the offered hand. He didn't have the energy for social niceties with people from a life he was discarding.  
  
""Excuse me,"" Jake said, moving to go around them.  
  
Just then, a nurse called out from down the hall.  
  
""Mr. Peterson? Dr. Miles is ready for you.""  
  
Jake nodded towards the nurse. ""That's me.""  
  
He started to move past Emily and Brandon.  
  
Emily watched him, her brow furrowed. His complete lack of reaction, his calm demeanor – it was so different from the persistent, almost desperate Jake she knew.  
  
She saw the cast on his leg, the slight bruising still visible on his temple. She'd heard about the accident from Matt, of course. Matt had been frantic. But he hadn't told her the extent of Jake's memory loss concerning her. He just said Jake was ""different.""  
  
A flicker of something unreadable crossed her face – confusion? Guilt?  
  
Brandon watched Jake walk away, then turned back to Emily, his arm still around her.  
  
""So that's the infamous Jake,"" Brandon said, a proprietary tone in his voice. He then lowered his voice, as if confiding. ""Still carrying a torch for you, huh?""  
  
Emily didn't answer, her gaze still on Jake's retreating back.  
  
Jake could hear snippets of their conversation. He ignored them.  
  
He reached Dr. Miles' office and went in.  
  
The check-up was quick. Dr. Miles confirmed his leg was healing well, and his concussion symptoms were resolving.  
  
""Any flashes of memory about the person you forgot?"" Dr. Miles asked.  
  
""No,"" Jake said firmly. ""And I'm not trying to remember.""  
  
Dr. Miles looked at him thoughtfully. ""Well, sometimes the mind protects itself. If you're comfortable with that, then focus on your recovery.""  
  
After the appointment, Jake headed for the hospital's small courtyard to get some fresh air before calling a cab.  
  
He sat on a bench near a small, decorative pond.  
  
A few minutes later, Brandon approached him. Alone.  
  
""Hey, Jake, right?"" Brandon sat on the bench, a little too close for comfort.  
  
Jake nodded, not looking at him.  
  
""Emily told me about your accident,"" Brandon said, his tone sympathetic. ""Tough break.""  
  
Jake didn't respond.  
  
""Look, man,"" Brandon continued, ""about Emily... she's a great girl. Been through a lot. That whole thing with you... it was a lot for her.""  
  
Jake finally turned to him. ""What whole thing?""  
  
Brandon looked surprised. ""You know... your constant pursuit of her. She felt harassed.""  
  
""I don't remember any of it,"" Jake said flatly.  
  
Brandon raised an eyebrow. ""Amnesia? Convenient."" The sympathy was gone, replaced by skepticism. ""So you're saying you have no feelings for Emily anymore?""  
  
""I'm saying I don't know her,"" Jake repeated, keeping his voice level. ""I'm leaving town today. She won't have to worry about me 'harassing' her anymore.""  
  
Brandon studied him for a moment. ""Good. Because she's with me now. We're giving it another shot."" He smiled, a possessive glint in his eyes. ""We always find our way back to each other.""  
  
As Brandon spoke, he fumbled with his phone, trying to pull up a photo, presumably of him and Emily.  
  
His fingers slipped. The phone flew out of his hand, arcing through the air, and landed with a splash right in the middle of the shallow ornamental pond.  
  
""D\*\*n it!"" Brandon yelped, jumping up.  
  
He leaned over the edge of the pond, reaching for his submerged phone. He overbalanced, his feet skidding on the wet edge.  
  
With a shout, Brandon tumbled headfirst into the murky water. It wasn't deep, maybe waist-high, but he went under completely for a second.  
  
Jake just watched, a strange sense of detachment washing over him.  
  
Emily, who had apparently been looking for Brandon, rushed into the courtyard at that moment.  
  
She saw Brandon flailing in the pond. She saw Jake standing by the edge.  
  
She didn't hesitate.  
  
""Brandon!"" she screamed, and without a second thought, she kicked off her shoes and scrambled into the pond.  
  
The water sloshed around her knees as she reached Brandon, who was sputtering and coughing. He clearly wasn't a strong swimmer, even in shallow water.  
  
She grabbed his arm, pulling him upright. ""Are you okay?""  
  
He coughed, ""Yeah... just... my phone...""  
  
Emily helped him stagger out of the pond, soaked and shivering.  
  
Then, Emily rounded on Jake. Her face was a mask of fury.  
  
""You! Did you push him?"" she shrieked, her voice trembling with rage. ""I saw you! You were standing right there! He falls in, and you just watch?""  
  
Her eyes, usually a warm brown, were dark with anger.  
  
""I always knew you were pathetic and obsessive, but this? This is despicable!""  
  
Jake stared at her. The injustice of the accusation was startling.  
  
""I didn't touch him,"" Jake said, his voice low and dangerous. ""He dropped his phone and fell in trying to get it.""  
  
""Liar!"" Emily screamed. Her hair was plastered to her face, water dripping from her clothes. She looked wild. ""You've always hated him! You've always tried to come between us!""  
  
Before Jake could say another word, Emily lunged at him.  
  
She shoved him hard in the chest.  
  
Caught off guard, with his injured leg and crutches, Jake had no balance.  
  
He stumbled backwards, his crutches clattering away.  
  
He felt a horrifying sensation of falling, then cold water enveloped him as he plunged into the pond.  
  
The murky water closed over his head. He hit the bottom, the impact jarring his injured leg. Pain shot through him, sharp and blinding.  
  
He struggled to push himself up, but his casted leg was heavy, an anchor. Water filled his nose, his mouth. Panic seized him.  
  
He could hear Emily shouting from the edge of the pond, ""Stay away from us, Jake! Just stay away!""  
  
He thought he heard her telling someone, ""Don't help him! He deserves it!""  
  
The world started to go dark. His lungs burned.  
  
This was it. This was how it ended. Drowned in a hospital pond by a woman he supposedly loved, a woman he didn't even remember.  
  
Then, blackness.

The juiciest scandal of the year at Kaverton University was the leaked sex tape of Elizabeth Fisher from the Art Department.

The video had been filmed in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.

Elizabeth was completely naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a full head taller than her. The sounds of their bodies moving in sync echoed steadily through the room.

When they finished, the man leaned close to her ear and murmured, ""Good girl.""

That phrase hit the group chat like a bomb, sending shockwaves across campus.

""That voice… No way! Is that Daniel?""

""Elizabeth's got serious game if she landed one of the university's board members. No wonder all the girls who used to bully her suddenly shut up.""

""I always thought Elizabeth was some innocent girl. Turns out she's a calculating bitch—like mother, like daughter.""

When the news reached Elizabeth, she was in her dorm, knitting a scarf for Daniel Woolridge.

Her roommate blasted the video at full volume, passing the phone around with a mocking grin.

She stretched her voice in exaggerated glee. ""Elizabeth, you're moaning like a pro. How much practice have you had?""

Laughter exploded around the room.

Elizabeth froze, her face draining of color. The half-finished scarf slipped from her hands as she bolted out the door.

She stumbled to Daniel's office, desperate to confront him, to ask what was going on.

But just as she reached the door, she heard a voice inside—sarcastic and biting.

""Daniel, you didn't leave Elizabeth a shred of dignity, huh? You made sure her face was crystal clear in the video. She doesn't even have a chance to deny it.""

Elizabeth's mind went blank. A deafening roar filled her ears as cold dread swept through her body.

""She brought it on herself. Messing with the woman Daniel loves most? She got what she deserved.""

""Yeah, poor Daniel. Not only did he have to spread rumors about Elizabeth's mom being a homewrecker, but he also had to play the hero, pretending to protect her from bullies and acting like he was madly in love.""

""By the way, Daniel, when are you planning to tell her the truth? If she finds out the guy she's been in love with is actually her future brother-in-law, she's going to pass out on the spot!""

Daniel lounged on the couch, looking utterly at ease, a cigarette dangling between his fingers as he tapped the ashes into the tray. His face was unreadable behind a thin haze of smoke.

Noticing the silence, one of his friends quickly added, ""Feeling sorry for her? Don't forget that she went all out to get Cheryl exiled abroad for two whole years. Do you think we should just let her off the hook after that? Cheryl was starving and freezing out there!""

At the mention of Cheryl Fisher, Daniel finally stirred.

He stubbed out the cigarette and said calmly, ""We'll wait until Cheryl's back. That day also happens to be a special anniversary that Elizabeth has been looking forward to. I'll give her a little 'surprise.' She'll pay back everything she owes Cheryl.""

Elizabeth's breath caught in her throat.

Through the smoke, her eyes locked onto Daniel's cold, sharp profile. Something inside her cracked wide open. The pain in her chest nearly knocked her off her feet.

So, all those disgusting rumors about her mother—they'd come from him? His affection—his protection, it had all been part of his revenge.

The woman he truly loved was Cheryl, her half-sister.

She couldn't bear to hear another word. Heart pounding, she turned and fled, stumbling blindly down the hallway.

But she didn't get far.

A group of girls stepped into her path.

""Well, well, look who it is. The star of the sex tape!""

""Just came out of his office—what, couldn't wait to offer yourself up again?""

Elizabeth's face turned ghostly pale. She tried to push past them, but they shoved her back and forth like a toy.

Then, suddenly, Daniel's low, icy voice cut through the chaos. ""Laying a finger on Elizabeth right in front of me? You must have a death wish.""

No one knew when Daniel had left his office, but now his tall, broad-shouldered figure was striding calmly toward them.

The girls scattered like startled birds the moment they saw him.

Daniel walked up to Elizabeth and gently smoothed her windblown hair. As he bent down and looked into her eyes, his fingers brushed lightly across her cheek.

""Didn't I tell you? If anyone messes with you again, just say my name.""

The sharp, acrid smell of tobacco assaulted Elizabeth's senses, instantly irritating her eyes and making her throat feel tight and scratchy.

The Daniel standing before her blurred with the one from her memories—the man who had protected her time and time again. It felt like a dream from another life.

Back when her mother, Julia Bennett, had taken her own life, her father, Samson Fisher, had gone back to his first love, Wanda Payne, leaving Elizabeth in a home where she wasn't quite an orphan—but it sure felt like one.

Then the rumors began to spread at school that Julia had been a mistress, and that Cheryl was the rightful daughter of the Fisher family.

As ""the mistress' daughter"", bullying became her daily reality.

It was Daniel who had pulled her out of that hell.

With nothing more than the weight of his name as a board member, he carved out a small, warm corner of the world just for her.

Just yesterday, on Daniel's birthday, the two of them had slept together, tipsy from too much wine.

That night, Daniel had shed his usual refined, aloof image and pinned her against the floor-to-ceiling window with a hunger that left her trembling from nerves and fear.

In that moment, when he took her for the first time, Elizabeth had felt like a lost bird finally finding its way home.

She had no idea that ""home"" was nothing more than a carefully laid trap.

Her mind swirled in a daze.

By the time she came back to her senses, Daniel was already leading her out of the administration building. She slid into the front passenger seat of his car without a word.

Chapter 2

As always, Daniel leaned over to buckle Elizabeth's seatbelt for her. Noticing the redness around her eyes, he spoke gently, his voice laced with reassurance.

""The video was an accident. I'll take care of it and make sure it's wiped clean. You're not in a good state today. Let me take you home so you can rest.""

Elizabeth pressed her lips together, but his earlier words echoed in her mind. Before she could stop them, tears spilled uncontrollably down her cheeks.

Daniel paused, clearly caught off guard.

He reached up to wipe her tears, then almost as if something had just occurred to him, he opened the car door.

""Wait here a second, I need to buy something.""

As the door shut behind him, Elizabeth noticed he'd left the wrong phone behind.

His phone sat in the cup holder between them. Almost without thinking, she picked it up and typed in Cheryl's birthday.

The screen unlocked instantly.

At the top of his WhatsApp chats was Cheryl's name.

In their most recent messages, Cheryl had asked him if he could cut things off with Elizabeth before she came back home.

Daniel had replied, ""She's just a toy. I was never really with her.""

Elizabeth's chest tightened painfully. Fighting back the burning in her nose, she scrolled further up.

For the past two years, while Cheryl had been abroad, Daniel had called her every single night without fail, always around 8:00 pm—the same time he always told Elizabeth he was in board meetings and couldn't be disturbed.

On top of that, he had been sending Cheryl money every month—six-figure transfers, clean and direct, with no note attached.

And Cheryl knew how to play it sweet too.

Every now and then, she'd send him selfies, asking for compliments, and Daniel would reply with cute animal stickers—ones Elizabeth had never seen before—telling her not to wear so little, to stay warm, to take care of herself.

Staring at the chat history, Elizabeth finally understood. She had never truly known Daniel at all. The kindness he'd shown her, the tenderness, the care—it was only a sliver of the love he gave to Cheryl.

Daniel returned to the car with a small box of emergency contraceptive pills.

He gently stroked Elizabeth's hair, his voice soft, careful, just like always.

""Last night was a little rushed. I didn't take the right precautions. Take this, just in case.""

Elizabeth clutched the box so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her lips were pressed together so hard that they nearly bled.

If she hadn't heard it with her own ears, she might still have believed Daniel actually cared about her.

But now, she was wide awake.

When the car pulled up in front of the villa, Daniel leaned in to kiss her goodbye like he always did. But this time, Elizabeth turned her head away and fumbled with her seatbelt.

Daniel's eyes darkened. He pulled her into his arms, holding her tight.

""Still upset about the video?"" he asked.

Elizabeth said nothing.

""I didn't film it. The hotel manager's already been fired.""

He lifted her chin with a finger, his voice low and coaxing. ""Elizabeth, I never wanted to hurt you. I never will. Our anniversary's coming up—I'll make it up to you then.""

Lies dressed as kindness cut deeper than truth ever could.

Her nose stung. She pushed him away and muttered, ""I'm going in.""

She practically ran up the steps and into the villa.

The moment she stepped through the door, she ran straight into Samson. His face twisted with rage. Before she could even open her mouth, he raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.

""Elizabeth, I underestimated you. You want to date someone, fine. But to film some filthy, disgraceful video? You've humiliated me completely!"" he shouted.

His voice was sharp, cutting, and merciless as he continued, ""No wonder everyone at your school picks on you. It's not because they're cruel; it's because you're disgusting and shameless. You're the rot that draws the flies!""

He threw a plane ticket at her feet. ""I booked you a flight for seven days from now. Get the hell out, and don't ever come back.""

Elizabeth bent down to pick it up. Her fingers trembled, as if the thin slip of paper weighed a hundred pounds.

It felt less like a boarding pass and more like a final sentence—a declaration that the world itself had abandoned her.

Samson thought she was a disgrace and just wanted her gone.

That was fine—Elizabeth didn't want to stay, either.

""I'll go,"" she said calmly. ""And I'll do as you said. I won't come back. Ever.""

Samson froze, thinking he must have misheard her.

Back when he had arranged for Cheryl to study abroad, he'd tried to convince Elizabeth to go too. But she had refused.

After pressing her for a reason, he'd found out she was in love, head over heels, no less.

He'd assumed she would put up a fight again this time. He never expected her to agree so readily.

His anger cooled, if only just slightly. He spoke again, his voice sharp.

""Cheryl's coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome party for her. You'll be there. The video's already out. If you don't show your face, the rumors will only get worse.""

Elizabeth nodded. ""Got it.""

…

She requested three days off from school.

In that time, she gathered everything Daniel had ever given her and listed them all online for resale at full price.

Three days later, Cheryl returned.

Samson hosted a lavish welcome party for her at Kaverton's biggest hotel, inviting every major name in business and high society.

And Daniel was among them.

Elizabeth hadn't expected to see him there. The moment she caught sight of him, she turned to leave. But Daniel grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a quiet hallway.

He pinned her against the wall, hands braced on either side of her, caging her in. His breath was warm against her ear as he spoke.

""You've been skipping school and not answering my messages. You didn't even say a word about our anniversary. Elizabeth, do you have any idea how worried I've been?""

Chapter 3

Daniel's eyes locked onto Elizabeth, his frustration over her disappearance simmering just beneath the surface.

Elizabeth pressed her lips together before forcing herself to meet his gaze. ""Mr. Woolridge, I didn't realize you could get so worked up over a meaningless hookup.""

The sudden sharpness in her tone, so unlike the obedient, quiet Elizabeth he was used to, caught him off guard.

Something defiant flashed in his eyes. In one swift motion, he yanked her closer, wrapping his arms around her waist in a possessive grip.

""A hookup? One time in two years, and you're calling that a hookup?"" he scoffed.

Elizabeth had no idea what had gotten into him. Before she could react, he grabbed her chin and leaned in like he was about to kiss her.

Just then, a voice interrupted them.

""Daniel, so this is where you ran off to. Cheryl's looking for you.""

Daniel frowned and loosened his hold on her. Turning to the man, he said, ""Got it. I'm on my way.""

Elizabeth tilted her head, feigning surprise. ""You know my sister?""

""Know her? Their relationship is a lot more interesting than you think,"" the guy said with a smirk. ""Brace yourself, Elizabeth. You're in for a shock.""

As the two of them walked away, a flicker of sarcasm passed through Elizabeth's eyes.

They operated under the smug assumption of her ignorance, confident that their orchestrated display of degradation would reduce her to pieces for their evening's entertainment.

What they didn't know was that she'd already pulled herself together, and she was more than ready to cut Daniel out of her life for good.

As the banquet reached its peak, the lights suddenly went out.

Moments later, a spotlight flared to life, illuminating the stage. Daniel appeared in a sleek black suit, escorting Cheryl, who was dressed in a stunning white gown, to the center of the room.

Samson beamed as he raised a hand to quiet the crowd. Then he spoke loudly and clearly, ""Thank you all for coming tonight.

""We're here not only to welcome Cheryl back from her studies abroad, but also to share some exciting news.

""The Fisher and Woolridge families have been close for generations. Years ago, we arranged an engagement between Cheryl and Daniel.

""Now that they've fallen in love, we'll be holding their engagement party at the end of the month. We hope you'll all join us to witness their happiness!""

As soon as Samson finished, Daniel's friends turned to Elizabeth, clearly waiting for her to break down.

But Elizabeth stood quietly and calmly in the crowd as if what was happening on stage had absolutely nothing to do with her.

Daniel frowned. This was the moment Elizabeth was supposed to lose control, to crumble. But instead, she was unnaturally composed. A strange irritation bubbled up inside him.

Cheryl, noticing the shift in his energy, leaned in and asked, ""Dan, what's wrong?""

Daniel quickly looked away from Elizabeth and replied smoothly, ""Nothing. Just spaced out for a second.""

But he knew better. Elizabeth had loved him. There was no way she felt nothing.

She was just putting on a brave face.

…

Elizabeth splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom, scrubbing hard.

Thinking back to how desperately she'd clung to Daniel, she felt nothing but disgust for herself.

No wonder he'd only touched her that one time in two whole years. It wasn't because he cherished her. It was because she simply wasn't worth touching.

And the night she had treasured—her first time—meant nothing to him. It was simply the perfect weapon to ruin her life completely.

When Elizabeth returned to the banquet hall, Samson called her over. ""Elizabeth, come say hello to your future brother-in-law.""

She walked up to Daniel with a perfectly measured smile. ""Hello, Daniel, my brother-in-law.""

The word hit him hard, and his expression darkened instantly.

Cheryl, completely oblivious, beamed. ""Lizzy, I just heard Dan's a board member at your school. What a small world! If you ever run into trouble, just ask him for help. We're family now, after all.""

Elizabeth clenched her jaw. ""I won't be bothering Daniel.""

She didn't even look at him, but she could feel his stare—icy and sharp, like a blade pressed to her skin.

After a few more polite exchanges, Elizabeth was about to excuse herself, but Cheryl looped an arm through hers with exaggerated warmth.

""It's been so long since we talked, Lizzy. I've got so much to catch up on with you.""

Before Elizabeth could respond, Cheryl dragged her into the lounge.

The moment the door shut behind them, Cheryl dropped the sweet act. Her smile vanished, replaced by a cold, cutting look.

""Elizabeth, I heard you slept with Daniel, and now the video's everywhere. Did you really think cheap, disgusting tricks like that would make him fall for you?

""Let me spell it out for you—he doesn't like you. In fact, he can't stand you. You know those rumors about your mom being a homewrecker? I told him to spread them.

""And about him chasing you? That was my idea. I wanted to watch you fall for him, bit by bit—just so he could be the one to destroy you.""

Chapter 4

Elizabeth asked quietly, ""Why?""

""Why? Because you don't know your place. Your mother's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to everything that belongs to the Fisher family.

""All of it should've been mine. You're the daughter of a mistress—what right do you have to enjoy the luxury and status that should've been mine?"" Cheryl scoffed.

Elizabeth could tolerate a lot, but not when someone dragged her mother through the mud.

She stormed up to Cheryl, her voice shaking with fury, every word forced through gritted teeth.

""My mother wasn't a mistress. She married my father without even knowing you or your mom existed. It was you two who drove her to her death.""

Cheryl hadn't expected Elizabeth to talk back. Her expression twisted in rage as she raised her hand to slap her.

Just then, the lounge door burst open.

From the corner of her eye, Cheryl spotted Daniel walking in and instantly switched tactics. Thinking fast, she grabbed a handful of mixed nuts from the table and shoved them into her mouth.

A second later, she collapsed to the floor, slurring her words dramatically through a mouthful of food. ""Elizabeth… why would you make me eat that? You know I'm allergic to nuts…""

Daniel rushed to her side without hesitation, shoving Elizabeth aside.

She stumbled back, hitting the edge of a nearby coffee table.

A porcelain cup shattered on the floor. Shards of glass tore into Elizabeth's palms, leaving her hands bloodied, but Daniel didn't even glance her way.

He was already kneeling beside Cheryl, wrapping her in his arms. ""Cheryl, are you okay?""

Tears welled in Cheryl's eyes as she clung weakly to his arm.

""I just wanted to catch up with Lizzy… I don't know what I said wrong. She suddenly forced me to eat those snacks… Look at me, Daniel. Am I breaking out in hives?""

Daniel looked down, and sure enough, angry red welts were rapidly blooming across Cheryl's skin.

""What do I do? The banquet isn't even over yet; I don't want to embarrass you in front of everyone. Makeup—right, I can cover it with makeup!""

Daniel gripped Cheryl's wrist tightly, his expression darkening. ""You're breaking out in hives and still worried about crap like that? Enough. I'm taking you to the hospital.""

He scooped Cheryl into his arms. Just before leaving, he shot Elizabeth a cold, scathing look.

Elizabeth forced herself to stand. Pain surged through her body with every movement. Blood poured freely from her hands, soaking her dress in seconds.

But she couldn't feel it. It was as if she'd fallen into a bottomless pit, and every ounce of sensation had drained from her body.

She called over a waiter and asked for a first aid kit, then silently tended to her wounds, her fingers trembling the entire time.

By the time she was done, her body was drained, her mind foggy. She dragged her feet toward the exit, too exhausted to think.

As soon as she stepped into the hallway, several figures lunged out of the shadows. Before she could react, they grabbed her and dragged her into a nearby storage room.

A rough hand clamped around her jaw, forcing her head up.

The next second, a burning liquid was poured straight into her mouth—pepper spray in liquid form, sharp and overwhelming.

Elizabeth's eyes flew open in horror.

Like Cheryl, she had a severe allergy, specifically to chili peppers. This much concentrated pepper could kill her.

""Mmff… stop…""

Elizabeth tried to fight back, but they didn't give her a chance. Cup after cup was forced down her throat—one after another.

She choked violently, her face flushed deep red as her body convulsed. Her wounded hands clawed weakly at the floor, the scraping sound raw and desperate.

The attackers didn't stop. If anything, her suffering only excited them further.

""Cheryl is Daniel's everything, and you dared lay a hand on her? Do you even know your place?""

""Heard you got bullied a lot at school. You probably got passed around by half the guys there. Do you think someone like Daniel—so proud and picky—would ever want a used-up whore like you?""

""Drink up, slut. Consider it your apology to Cheryl, or things are gonna get a lot worse for you.""

Elizabeth's vision blurred, her mind slipping further and further away.

With the last ounce of strength she had left, she whispered a name—barely audible. ""Dan…""

That was all she managed before cruel laughter exploded around her.

""Hah! You're still hoping Daniel's gonna come save you?""

""He's the one who told us to do this. You hurt Cheryl; he wants you dead!""

""Hey, let's rip her dress off and send him the pictures. Let Daniel blow off some steam, too!""

They swarmed her. In seconds, they tore her dress to shreds.

Then came the camera flashes, shot after shot of Elizabeth's battered, half-conscious body. Until finally, her strength gave out completely, and everything went black.

Chapter 5

When Elizabeth woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed.

Daniel sat beside her, working on his laptop. As if sensing her stir, he looked up and met her gaze.

The moment their eyes met, he let out the faintest sigh of relief, but his voice remained cold and sharp.

""How does it feel to be on the receiving end for once? Take this as a lesson. Don't mess with Cheryl again.""

Elizabeth turned her face away without a word. A single tear slid quietly down her cheek.

She used to see Daniel as her salvation. But now, after what he'd done to her… how was he any different from the people who used to bully her?

Daniel watched her in silence. For a moment, something strange stirred in his chest.

She was the one who'd gone after Cheryl out of jealousy. After everything she'd done, she deserved this.

So why did he feel guilty when he saw her cry?

Just then, a young nurse opened the door. ""Mr. Woolridge, the air conditioner in Ms. Cheryl's room just went out…""

Daniel frowned. ""Then fix it. Why are you telling me?""

""We've already called maintenance, but they won't be here for another hour. Ms. Cheryl keeps saying she's cold, and unfortunately, there aren't any spare rooms available…""

The second he heard that, Daniel stood up. ""What kind of hospital takes an hour to fix an air conditioner?""

His brows drew tight. ""Cheryl's always had a weak constitution. She can't handle the cold. Move Elizabeth and let Cheryl have her room instead.""

The nurse hesitated, glancing uneasily at Elizabeth lying in the bed.

Elizabeth had a severe allergy to chili peppers. After being force-fed so much of it, the fact that she was still alive was a miracle.

But the damage was done. Her esophagus and stomach lining were badly burned. Even the slightest irritation could put her in danger all over again.

Meanwhile, Cheryl had only eaten a single bite of a nut-filled dessert. A few allergy shots and she was already on the mend.

And yet, everything Elizabeth had suffered didn't seem to matter at all to Daniel.

""What are you waiting for? If Cheryl catches a cold in this dump, your entire hospital's going under,"" he snapped.

The message was clear. The nurse had no choice but to obey.

Soon enough, Elizabeth was moved to Cheryl's vacated room.

Daniel stayed with Cheryl. Elizabeth was left alone, lying in the oversized hospital bed, staring at the ceiling in a daze.

As the memories of everything she'd endured replayed in her mind, the dam finally broke. Tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

Then came the cold. A deep, creeping chill wrapped around her like a shroud.

She glanced toward the source and froze. The air conditioner was on, blasting icy air at full power.

In that instant, it all clicked.

Cheryl had lied about the air conditioner being broken. It wasn't about escaping the cold—it was about creating it.

She wanted Elizabeth to move here—to remain sick, weak, freezing. It was just another twisted form of revenge.

The temperature kept dropping. The air sliced into her skin like invisible knives. She trembled so hard her teeth chattered.

She tried to call for help, but her throat was too swollen. No sound came out.

She reached for the call button, but her arm was too weak. It barely lifted an inch before falling limply back to the bed.

Elizabeth curled into herself, clinging to whatever warmth she had left. She felt completely hopeless.

She didn't know how long she lay there—abandoned, freezing, and slowly slipping away—before someone finally came.

When she forced her swollen eyes open, the face that greeted her wasn't one of concern. It was Cheryl, standing at her bedside, smirking with sick amusement.

""Elizabeth, look at you. You're pathetic. You look like a stray dog,"" she sneered. ""Daniel did all this just to help me vent. By now, everyone would have seen your pictures—they're passing them around for laughs.

""Oh, and guess what? Some adult film companies reached out earlier. Said you'd be perfect for the lead in their next shoot. Isn't that hilarious?

Cheryl laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world.

Then, just as suddenly, her smile vanished. She grabbed Elizabeth's arm, right where the wounds were worst, and dug her fingers in.

Blood spurted instantly. Elizabeth's vision blackened from the pain.

""Now, do you finally understand who he loves? Be smart. Admit your mom was a homewrecker and disappear. I don't ever want to see your disgusting face again. You make me sick,"" Cheryl hissed.

The light in Elizabeth's eyes dimmed, fading into a hollow, lifeless emptiness.

Disappear?

She would.

Soon, she'd be leaving for a faraway country, and she would never look back.",1,1748156261.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
The call came on a gray Tuesday morning.  
  
My cell phone vibrated on the cheap nightstand I'd bought for this temporary apartment.  
  
A number I didn't recognize.  
  
I answered.  
  
""Ms. Hayes?"" a crisp, unfamiliar female voice asked.  
  
""This is Maya Hayes,"" I said.  
  
""This is Patricia from HR at Sterling, Cromwell & Finch. I'm calling to confirm that your resignation, effective last Friday, has been processed.""  
  
Her tone was flat, like she was reading from a script.  
  
""All outstanding payments, including unused vacation days, will be direct deposited by the end of the week.""  
  
""Thank you,"" I managed.  
  
""Have a good day, Ms. Hayes.""  
  
Click.  
  
No 'we're sorry to see you go.' No 'good luck in your future endeavors.'  
  
Just processed. Final.  
  
It felt like a door slamming shut, quietly but firmly.  
  
My four years there, erased with a bureaucratic keystroke.  
  
Chloe called an hour later.  
  
""So, it's official?"" she asked, her voice softer than the HR woman's.  
  
""Official,"" I confirmed, trying to sound breezy.  
  
""You sure about this, Maya? You haven't told me the real reason. 'Seeking new opportunities' is such corporate BS.""  
  
I forced a laugh. ""Just needed a change, Chloe. You know how it is. New York grinds you down after a while.""  
  
""If you say so,"" she said, unconvinced. ""But if Ethan Sterling had anything to do with this, I swear...""  
  
""He didn't,"" I lied, the name a sudden, sharp pressure in my chest. ""It was my decision. Purely professional.""  
  
There was a pause. I knew she didn't believe me.  
  
""Okay, Maya. Whatever you need. But call me if you want to talk. Really talk.""  
  
""I will. Thanks, Chloe.""  
  
I hung up, the lie bitter on my tongue.  
  
I stood by the window of my small, rented room on the Upper West Side.  
  
It wasn't much, but it was mine, and it was far from the gleaming towers of midtown.  
  
My gaze fell on a small, velvet box on the dresser.  
  
I hadn't unpacked much, but that box... I'd taken it out.  
  
Inside lay a pair of delicate diamond earrings. A birthday gift from Ethan, two years ago.  
  
Impersonal. Expensive. Like everything he gave.  
  
The city spread out below, indifferent. My mind drifted back.  
  
Four years ago, I was fresh from Montana, a full scholarship to a paralegal program in New York under my belt.  
  
The city was a beast, glittering and terrifying.  
  
Sterling, Cromwell & Finch was the Everest of law firms.  
  
Getting a job there felt like winning the lottery.  
  
I was determined, wide-eyed, and completely out of my depth.  
  
My first cubicle was smaller than my childhood closet.  
  
The clothes I wore, bought on sale, felt cheap next to the tailored suits and silk blouses that rustled through the halls.  
  
Chloe Davies, a fellow paralegal, took pity on me.  
  
She was city-smart, quick-witted, with a wardrobe I envied and a kindness that was genuine.  
  
""You look like a deer in headlights,"" she'd said on my first day, offering me half her bagel. ""Stick with me, Montana. I'll show you the ropes.""  
  
Ethan Sterling was a name whispered in awe and a little fear.  
  
Senior partner. Razor-sharp. Devastatingly handsome in that old-money, East Coast way.  
  
He was in his early forties then, with a charisma that filled any room he entered.  
  
I saw him mostly from a distance, a titan striding through his domain.  
  
He rarely acknowledged junior staff like me.  
  
But I noticed him. The way his eyes, a cool, assessing blue, missed nothing.  
  
The way he could charm a hostile witness or eviscerate an opposing counsel with a few quiet words.  
  
My heart, foolish and young, developed a secret, schoolgirl crush.  
  
I knew it was ridiculous. He was a world away.  
  
I buried it deep, focusing on my work, determined to prove myself.  
  
I worked late, took on extra assignments, learned everything I could.  
  
One Thursday night, almost a year into my job, I was working late on a discovery deadline for one of Ethan's cases.  
  
The office was mostly empty, quiet except for the hum of the HVAC and the distant city sirens.  
  
I was in the firm's library, surrounded by stacks of documents, coffee cold beside me.  
  
The door opened. It was Ethan.  
  
He looked surprised to see me. ""Ms. Hayes, still here?""  
  
""Just finishing up the briefing binders for the Keston trial, Mr. Sterling.""  
  
He walked over, picked up a binder, flipped through it.  
  
His proximity made my breath catch. I could smell his cologne, something subtle and expensive.  
  
""Good work,"" he said, his voice low. ""Thorough.""  
  
He looked at me then, really looked, for the first time.  
  
His eyes lingered.  
  
""You should get some rest,"" he said, but he didn't move away.  
  
The air crackled. My pulse hammered.  
  
He reached out, his fingers brushing a stray strand of hair from my cheek.  
  
A jolt went through me.  
  
Then he leaned in and kissed me.  
  
It was unexpected, overwhelming.  
  
My carefully constructed professional boundaries shattered.  
  
Against every sensible thought in my head, I kissed him back.  
  
The next morning, a small, unmarked envelope was on my desk.  
  
Inside, five hundred-dollar bills. No note.  
  
My stomach twisted.  
  
It felt clinical. A transaction.  
  
Later that day, he called me into his office.  
  
His demeanor was all business.  
  
""Ms. Hayes,"" he began, not meeting my eye directly, ""last night was... an error in judgment. It won't happen again in a professional setting.""  
  
I nodded, my face burning.  
  
""However,"" he continued, finally looking at me, his gaze unreadable. ""If you were amenable to a more... discreet arrangement, outside of office hours...""  
  
He named a figure, a monthly ""allowance,"" he called it, that made my head spin. More than my salary.  
  
""I'm not looking for a relationship, Maya,"" he said, using my first name for the first time outside of that kiss. ""I'm not capable of one right now. This would be... companionship. Physical.""  
  
He paused. ""No strings. No expectations beyond what we agree.""  
  
I should have walked out. I should have been insulted.  
  
Part of me was.  
  
But the larger, longing part, the part that had secretly adored him for a year, ached.  
  
I thought of the bills in my purse. I thought of his kiss.  
  
""I understand,"" I heard myself say.  
  
It wasn't long before I learned about Seraphina Blake.  
  
Her name would come up in office gossip, whispered by senior associates who remembered.  
  
""Ethan's one true love,"" someone said once at an after-work drinks Chloe dragged me to.  
  
""The one that got away. Broke his heart, they say.""  
  
Seraphina Blake. A name that sounded like old money and effortless glamour.  
  
I saw her picture once, tucked discreetly into a silver frame on a low credenza in Ethan's office, almost hidden behind a stack of legal journals.  
  
Blonde, beautiful, an almost ethereal quality to her smile.  
  
They said she'd left him for a European prince years ago.  
  
Ethan never mentioned her. But her ghost was always there.  
  
It solidified what I already knew: I was a placeholder. A convenience.  
  
My significance in his life was minimal, confined to darkened bedrooms and hushed encounters.  
  
Despite it all, despite the clear terms, despite Seraphina's shadow, I fell deeper.  
  
The ""allowance"" went into a separate account, mostly untouched. I didn't want his money, not really.  
  
I wanted him.  
  
His rare smiles, the fleeting moments of shared laughter after a difficult case, the way he sometimes looked at me when he thought I wasn't watching – I collected these crumbs.  
  
one night, after a particularly stressful week, we were at his penthouse.  
  
He was quieter than usual, staring out at the city lights.  
  
I took a breath, my heart pounding. ""Ethan,"" I said, ""I know what you said about no strings. But... I care about you. More than I should.""  
  
He turned, his expression unreadable.  
  
""I want to be with you,"" I blurted out, ""even like this. Even if it's all I can have.""  
  
I was offering myself up, knowing the terms were his, always his.  
  
He was silent for a long moment.  
  
Then he said, ""Are you sure, Maya? I can't offer you more.""  
  
""I'm sure,"" I whispered, a fool in love.  
  
For four years, that was our life.  
  
A secret, lived in the margins of his real existence.  
  
Late night calls. Discreet arrivals and departures from his apartment.  
  
Never a public acknowledgment. Never a dinner date that wasn't room service.  
  
My friends, my family back in Montana, knew nothing.  
  
Chloe suspected, I think. She'd give me knowing looks sometimes, but never pressed.  
  
I told myself I was content.  
  
I had a part of him, didn't I?  
  
He was brilliant, sophisticated. He challenged me intellectually, even if he starved me emotionally.  
  
I learned to read his moods, to anticipate his needs.  
  
I convinced myself that this carefully compartmentalized affection was enough.  
  
That one day, maybe, he'd see me. Really see me.  
  
Then, last spring, the news broke.  
  
It was all over the gossip sites, then the mainstream media.  
  
Seraphina Blake, Ethan's long-lost love, was back.  
  
Her scandalous engagement to a minor European royal had imploded spectacularly.  
  
She'd returned to New York, tail between her legs, but still a darling of the social pages.  
  
I saw a picture of her at some charity gala, Ethan by her side.  
  
He was looking at her with an expression I'd never seen him direct at me.  
  
Open adoration. Undisguised longing.  
  
It was a public declaration.  
  
My carefully constructed fantasy shattered.  
  
The ground beneath my feet disappeared.  
  
This was it. The other shoe. The one I always knew would drop.  
  
A few days later, I overheard him in his office.  
  
He was on the phone, his door slightly ajar. I was walking by to drop off some files.  
  
His voice was different. Softer, more animated than I usually heard it.  
  
""...yes, Seraphina, of course. Tonight? Perfect. I'll make the reservations at Per Se.""  
  
A pause. Then, a low chuckle. ""Don't worry about Maya. She understands her place. She's… convenient. Always has been.""  
  
Convenient.  
  
His word, not mine this time. But it hit with the force of a physical blow.  
  
My carefully tended hope withered and died.  
  
I understood my place. Yes, I did.  
  
It was the place of a fool.  
  
I turned, walked back to my desk, and typed my resignation letter.  
  
Mr. Thompson, the managing partner, had accepted it without question, his expression impassive.  
  
Now, standing in my sterile room, packing the few belongings I'd brought, I picked up Ethan's last “gift.”  
  
A sleek, new laptop, left on my old desk the day after I submitted my resignation.  
  
No note. Just the laptop.  
  
As if that could smooth over four years of being his dirty little secret.  
  
I hadn't turned it on.  
  
I walked into the small kitchen, opened the trash can, and dropped the laptop inside.  
  
It landed with a dull thud.  
  
Then I went back for the velvet box with the diamond earrings.  
  
He'd given them to me after I'd helped him win a particularly difficult case. ""A token of appreciation,"" he'd called it.  
  
My fingers fumbled with the clasp.  
  
They were beautiful. Cold.  
  
I thought of Seraphina, undoubtedly dripping in jewels that were declarations of love, not tokens of convenient service.  
  
They joined the laptop in the trash.  
  
The Hamptons. I remembered his casual mention of the firm's annual summer party there, a few weeks before Seraphina's return dominated the news.  
  
""You'll need a new dress, Maya. Something... appropriate.""  
  
His tone had been its usual detached self, but there was a hint of something else. Expectation.  
  
He wanted me there, but as what? Part of the scenery?  
  
The invitation had arrived formally, addressed to ""Ms. Maya Hayes,"" c/o Sterling, Cromwell & Finch.  
  
No ""and guest."" No personal touch.  
  
It was always like that. Keeping me at arm's length, even when I was in his arms.  
  
I looked at my reflection in the dusty mirror.  
  
Dark circles under my eyes. A certain hollowness that hadn't been there a few months ago.  
  
He was probably relieved I'd resigned.  
  
Made things cleaner for him and Seraphina. No loose ends.  
  
No awkward paralegal with deep feelings hanging around.  
  
The city lights outside seemed to mock me. Bright, indifferent. Just like him.  
  
My phone buzzed. A text message.  
  
From Ethan.  
  
My heart leaped, then sank.  
  
""Maya, are you okay? Thompson mentioned you seemed upset when you left. If you need anything, a reference, let me know. E.""  
  
A reference.  
  
That was his concern.  
  
Not that I was heartbroken. Not that he'd used me.  
  
But that my departure might reflect badly on him, or that I might cause trouble.  
  
I didn't reply.  
  
What was there to say?  
  
I remembered the one time I'd dared to ask about Seraphina, early in our ""arrangement.""  
  
""She's in the past,"" he'd said, his voice clipped, shutting down the conversation.  
  
But her photograph remained on his credenza.  
  
Sometimes, when he was in a rare, expansive mood, after too much scotch, he'd talk about his family, his ambitions.  
  
Never about her. She was a locked room.  
  
And I, foolishly, had hoped I might one day earn the key.  
  
I thought of the last time I saw him, the day I handed in my resignation.  
  
I'd requested a brief meeting with Mr. Thompson. Ethan had walked by the conference room.  
  
He'd paused, looked at me, a flicker of something – surprise? – in his eyes.  
  
Then he'd nodded curtly and walked on.  
  
No words. No acknowledgment of the chasm that had opened between us.  
  
He was already moving on, Seraphina firmly reinstalled in his life.  
  
I was a footnote.  
  
A bittersweet smile touched my lips. No, not bittersweet. Just bitter.  
  
""I wish you happiness, Ethan,"" I whispered to the empty room, the words tasting like ash.  
  
Of course, he couldn't hear me. He was probably dining with Seraphina, the city their oyster, my absence unnoticed.  
  
My last week at the firm was a blur of tying up loose ends and avoiding Ethan.  
  
It wasn't hard. He was suddenly very busy, often out of the office.  
  
With her, I presumed.  
  
On my final day, I packed my personal items from my cubicle into a single cardboard box.  
  
A few books. A chipped mug. A framed photo of the Montana landscape.  
  
As I was leaving, I nearly ran into him by the elevator bank.  
  
He was with Seraphina.  
  
She was stunning, even more so in person. Effortlessly chic in a cream-colored dress that probably cost more than my rent for six months.  
  
She looked me up and down, a faint, dismissive curl to her lip.  
  
Ethan just glanced at me, then turned his full attention back to Seraphina, his hand possessively on her arm.  
  
He didn't even nod.  
  
The elevator doors opened, and they stepped in, their laughter echoing faintly as the doors closed.  
  
I stood there, holding my box, feeling like a ghost.  
  
That night, I tripped on a loose paving stone walking back to my temporary apartment.  
  
My ankle twisted. Pain shot up my leg.  
  
I stumbled, dropping my box. Its contents scattered across the sidewalk.  
  
My Montana photo skittered into the gutter.  
  
A wave of desolation washed over me.  
  
Alone, injured, my small collection of memories dirtied on a New York street.  
  
It felt like a metaphor for my life.  
  
I limped the rest of the way, tears stinging my eyes.  
  
Later, huddled on the lumpy mattress, my ankle throbbing, I got another text.  
  
Ethan.  
  
""Heard you took a tumble. Seraphina was worried you might try to make a scene. Glad you kept your composure. Don't make things difficult, Maya.""  
  
Not 'are you hurt?' Not 'do you need help?'  
  
Just a warning. A threat, veiled in polite concern for Seraphina's delicate sensibilities.  
  
My composure. As if I had any fight left in me.  
  
He had no idea. Or maybe he did, and he just didn't care.  
  
The sheer, breathtaking arrogance of it.  
  
Something inside me finally snapped.  
  
Not with a bang, but with a slow, cold hardening.  
  
I found the small, worn leather-bound journal I'd kept during those four years.  
  
Filled with my hopes, my dreams, my foolish, unrequited love for Ethan Sterling.  
  
Page after page of self-deception.  
  
I took it, along with the few other small trinkets he'd given me – a silk scarf, a pen – things that had once seemed precious.  
  
I put them all in the metal trash can in the kitchen.  
  
I struck a match.  
  
And I watched them burn.  
  
The paper curled, blackened, turned to ash.  
  
It wasn't cathartic, not really.  
  
It was just… necessary.  
  
A cleansing.  
  
The smoke alarm didn't even go off.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Monday morning, I was back at Sterling, Cromwell & Finch.  
  
Not as an employee, but as a temporary contractor.  
  
Chloe had pulled some strings.  
  
""Thompson needs someone to handle the overflow from the Keston appeal,"" she'd explained. ""It's only for a few weeks. Good money. And you already know the case files inside out.""  
  
I needed the money. My savings were dwindling fast.  
  
And part of me, the stubborn, foolish part, wanted to prove I could walk back into that office with my head held high.  
  
I set up at a vacant desk in the paralegal pool, far from Ethan's corner office suite.  
  
I kept my interactions brief, professional.  
  
My resignation was common knowledge. Most people were polite, a little distant.  
  
No one mentioned Ethan.  
  
The first sighting was inevitable.  
  
Mid-morning, I was at the industrial-sized printer, collating documents.  
  
The elevator doors dinged open, and they walked out. Ethan and Seraphina.  
  
He was laughing at something she said, his arm around her waist.  
  
She was radiant, dressed in white, her blonde hair shimmering under the harsh office lights.  
  
They looked like a power couple from a magazine spread.  
  
My breath caught. The carefully constructed wall around my emotions threatened to crumble.  
  
He saw me. His smile faltered for a microsecond.  
  
Then his eyes slid past me, as if I were part of the furniture.  
  
Seraphina, however, met my gaze. A small, triumphant smirk played on her lips.  
  
She leaned into Ethan, possessively.  
  
It was a public branding. He was hers. I was nothing.  
  
I turned back to the printer, my hands trembling slightly.  
  
Later that day, Ethan blew off a crucial pre-trial conference call with a major client.  
  
Mr. Thompson was furious.  
  
Chloe told me the details later, her voice tight with anger.  
  
""He said he had a 'personal emergency',"" Chloe relayed. ""The 'personal emergency' was that Seraphina wanted to go shoe shopping. Shoe. Shopping. While a ten-million-dollar account सर्किल the drain.""  
  
The client was irate. Threats were made.  
  
It was chaotic.  
  
Ethan waltzed back in hours later, looking unconcerned, Seraphina clinging to his arm, a dozen designer shopping bags carried by a hapless junior associate.  
  
He didn't even apologize to Mr. Thompson.  
  
The fallout landed on me.  
  
Mr. Thompson, apoplectic but unwilling to directly confront his star partner's glaring lapse, needed a scapegoat for the client.  
  
Since I was technically still familiar with the Keston account from before and was on-site, I was dispatched to the client's office to smooth things over.  
  
""Just explain the... unforeseen delay, Hayes,"" Thompson had grumbled. ""And offer our sincerest apologies.""  
  
I spent two hours being politely but firmly lectured by the client's CEO.  
  
I apologized for Ethan's irresponsibility, for the firm's lack of professionalism.  
  
I promised it wouldn't happen again, knowing it was a lie Ethan would make me live.  
  
It was humiliating, taking the blame for his arrogance.  
  
I felt like a human shield.  
  
The next day, Seraphina Blake decided she needed a personal assistant.  
  
And apparently, I was it.  
  
She found me in the firm's kitchen, making tea.  
  
""Maya, isn't it?"" she said, her voice syrupy sweet, but her eyes cold.  
  
""Yes,"" I replied, keeping my tone neutral.  
  
""Ethan tells me you're quite efficient. I need some errands run. My regular girl is off.""  
  
She handed me a list.  
  
Dry cleaning. Picking up a custom-ordered dog collar from a boutique on Madison Avenue.  
  
Reservations at three different exclusive restaurants because she ""hadn't decided"" where she wanted to dine that night.  
  
""Oh, and my favorite peonies. From that little shop on Lexington. Make sure they're freshly cut. And charge it all to Ethan's account, of course.""  
  
She smiled, a flash of perfectly white teeth. ""Don't dawdle.""  
  
I was a paralegal, not a gofer. But I was a contractor, desperate for the paycheck.  
  
I took the list.  
  
Her entitlement was breathtaking.  
  
The final errand was the peonies.  
  
I found the boutique. The flowers were exquisite, and expensive.  
  
As I was paying, using Ethan's black card he'd given Seraphina, who'd then passed to me, a woman brushed past me, jostling my arm.  
  
My purse, unzipped, fell. The contents spilled.  
  
Lipstick, keys, my wallet. And a small, antique silver locket – a gift from my grandmother.  
  
It skittered under a display table.  
  
Before I could react, Seraphina, who had apparently followed me or timed her arrival perfectly, shrieked.  
  
""My bracelet! That woman stole my diamond bracelet!""  
  
She pointed directly at me.  
  
The store manager rushed over. Other customers stared.  
  
""I didn't steal anything!"" I protested, my face burning.  
  
""I saw her!"" Seraphina insisted, her voice rising dramatically. ""It was on the counter, and she distracted me and snatched it! Check her purse!""  
  
My heart hammered against my ribs. This was insane.  
  
The manager, flustered, looked at me. ""Ma'am, if you wouldn't mind...""  
  
Humiliated, I upended my purse on the counter.  
  
No bracelet.  
  
""She probably hid it!"" Seraphina cried. ""Check her pockets!""  
  
Then, with a gasp, she ""spotted"" something glinting under the display table.  
  
She darted forward, picked it up.  
  
It was a diamond tennis bracelet, undeniably expensive. One I'd never seen before.  
  
""There!"" she exclaimed, holding it aloft. ""I knew it!""  
  
She turned to the manager. ""I want her arrested!""  
  
Ethan arrived just as two security guards were flanking me.  
  
Seraphina rushed to him, feigning distress.  
  
""Ethan, darling! She tried to steal my bracelet! The one you gave me!""  
  
He looked from her to me, his expression unreadable, then hardening as he focused on me.  
  
""Maya? What the hell is going on?"" His voice was ice.  
  
""I didn't do it, Ethan,"" I said, my voice shaking. ""She planted it. I swear.""  
  
Seraphina let out a sob. ""How can you say that? After I caught you red-handed?""  
  
Ethan put his arm around Seraphina, comforting her. He didn't even look at me.  
  
""This is a misunderstanding,"" he said to the manager, his tone clipped. ""My fiancée is distressed. We won't be pressing charges.""  
  
Fiancée. The word hit me harder than any accusation.  
  
He was announcing it. To the world. To me.  
  
""However,"" he continued, turning his cold gaze on me, ""Sterling, Cromwell & Finch does not tolerate theft among its employees. Or contractors.""  
  
He nodded to the manager. ""We'll handle this internally.""  
  
The security guards stepped back, but the damage was done.  
  
Everyone in the shop was staring at me, branded a thief.  
  
Back at the firm, Mr. Thompson was waiting.  
  
Ethan and Seraphina stood beside him, Seraphina looking pale and victimized.  
  
""Ms. Hayes,"" Thompson said, his voice grave. ""Given the... incident... and Ms. Blake's distress, your contract with the firm is terminated, effective immediately.""  
  
""But I didn't do anything!"" I pleaded. ""She set me up!""  
  
Thompson's face was impassive. ""Ethan has vouched for Ms. Blake's version of events. His word is final here.""  
  
""You'll be paid for the days you've worked,"" he continued. ""But I expect you to clear out your temporary desk now.""  
  
I looked at Ethan. He wouldn't meet my eyes.  
  
He chose her. He believed her. Or, more likely, he didn't care about the truth.  
  
He just wanted the problem – me – gone.  
  
My career in New York, already on life support, was now officially dead. Blacklisted.  
  
The accusation of theft, even without charges, would follow me.  
  
Chloe found me in the ladies' room, splashing cold water on my face.  
  
The hot tears of anger and injustice had finally come.  
  
""I heard,"" she said softly, handing me a tissue. ""It's bullshit, Maya. Everyone knows Seraphina is a viper.""  
  
""Not everyone,"" Iatek bitter. ""Not Ethan.""  
  
""He's an idiot,"" Chloe said fiercely. ""Blinded by... whatever that is.""  
  
Her support was a small comfort in a sea of humiliation.  
  
A few other paralegals offered quiet words of sympathy as I packed the few items I'd accumulated at the temporary desk.  
  
They knew. They saw. But they were powerless, just like me.  
  
No one dared cross Ethan Sterling, or his precious, vindictive fiancée.  
  
As I walked out of Sterling, Cromwell & Finch for the second, and undoubtedly final, time, I thought about the Ethan I used to know.  
  
Or the Ethan I thought I knew.  
  
The man who, despite his emotional distance, had shown flashes of brilliance, even kindness, in the early days.  
  
The man who'd discussed case strategy with me late into the night, treating me, for those brief moments, as an intellectual peer.  
  
Where was that man now?  
  
Had he ever really existed?  
  
Or had I just projected my own desires onto a charismatic, emotionally stunted shell?  
  
This new Ethan, so quick to believe the worst of me, so easily manipulated by Seraphina, was a stranger.  
  
A cruel, indifferent stranger.  
  
And I was finally, definitively, done with him.

It had been working perfectly fine with almost 90% storage left and barely any flaws. I sent it to a repair shop which said the keyboard was completely dysfunctional and needed to be replaced. That was US$259. He asked for my password for more comprehensive checking but I was dubious, so I paid upfront and agreed that if anything else was wrong, I'd pay again (BIG mistake. Please don't rub it in. It's tormenting me already.) Lo and behold, more problems popped up with Bluetooth, brightness, and even turning on the laptop.

The question is: Do I send it back, giving them my password, potentially paying even more than what I've paid right now for a laptop that might break more easily down the line, or do I just buy a new laptop for US$1150?

I have enough savings to make this purchase, but I'm absolutely beating myself up over this extremely expensive spill and I'm not thinking straight. Is this a sunk cost?

1kuw4wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kuw4wf/leaving_my_family_behind/,Leaving My Family Behind,"Hello, I hope you all have a nice day. This is gonna be more of a vent but I also seek advice from people who have more life experience than me and could offer me some advice on how to handle this the best possible way.

Context: 
I am a 25 year old man who is a immigrant in Germany from Bosnia. I moved here after my father did shortly post Corona in 2022 after my fathers family business went bankrupt. Me and my father worked together one of the worst construction jobs in order to settle financially in Germany and provide a nice living so my mother and sister can come here. When my sister came first she was taken care of out of my pocket personally until she started working four months later. My mother came and left because her visa couldn’t get approved due to our living space being too small. So the next half a year basically everything I managed to save up was given towards finding a new apartment, at one point even paying rent at both apartments at the same time. My mother finally came here last year in July but since she doesn’t know German we struggled to find her a job. Since january she has been attending language school so she can assimilate better. I should mention that my father works basically 13-14 hour day five days a week to provide for my mother. We all share the same financial burden and split all bills equally.

Now onto the problem and what I seek advice on. Since my sister and mother came I noticed the lack of appreciation from all of my family members on what I sacrificed for them. I have truly given it my all and “invested” thousands and thousands out of my end to provide a better living for them. Me and my father solely shared the financial burned of furnishing both apartments and sorting everything out. However, first my sister was very ungrateful and multiple times would refuse to share the burden. From not paying bills to refusing to pay me back the money I loaned her for her university tuition. My mother has been saying she regrets coming here and living with us and blames us for her unhappiness in life and tells us we “forced” her to come here so we owe her everything. I personally take the financial burden of providing for her for all entertainment and hobbies she has and spend hundreds every month on it. Every single day I have to listen to loud arguments between my family members over the dumbest things where they argue for hours, shout, slam doors and overall impact my mental health to the point where my motivation and mood is altered for the whole day. As someone who is a student of a masters degree in my last year, works and runs a startup business with around 850 customers so far this has been very detrimental to my mental health and has taken a toll on me and multiple times caused me to miss out on financial gains. I have also spent countless hours and days solving appointments for all of my family members and dealing with paperwork since none of them can speak German good enough. I tried to talk to my family and told them I can’t take this anymore and that I will look for a place of my own. I was guilt tripped by my father into being called selfish and was told if I ever move lit I will never be welcome in his house again. He has also called me incapable and told me that I will come begging for help one day and how I can’t do it without them. Telling me how I raised him and he didn’t raise me, along with a lot of hurtful things. When I started my startup I didn’t tell anyone a thing for almost a year until it took off and I started making around 12k in profit a month. My father has been kind of supportive but also multiple times would say hurtful things indirectly to me. He would say how “not everyone rich is smart” and sometimes “stupid people get lucky”. Also telling me that since I started making money I have become “ungrateful” and “think I am something”. My whole life I never had my father being proud of me and never a single time have I felt like I was enough in his eyes, but I never felt like I needed his support anyway. I am used to being independent and feel uneasy if I have to rely on anyone ad a consequence of that, which is both good and bad. The last straw for me was this morning when I woke up around 6am and was making a breakfast and having coffee when my father woke up and started an argument out of nowhere over dishes in the sink (I was still eating at the time) and I was baffled because the previous day was ruined because of them arguing the whole day. It ended up with my mother and sister both waking up and everyone just shouting like lunatics while I watched the whole thing and wondered why did I do this to myself.

How do I handle this the best possible way? I want peace and want to live by myself. I love my family but I can’t live with them anymore. I still want them in my life, just not every day. I have truly given it my all, but my efforts feel unappreciated. I feel as if I move away it will take a toll on them financially, but I also don’t want to be suckered into helping anyone anymore. I want to focus on myself and make something out of myself in this life, but for that I need peace of mind in my own house after fighting so many battles every day.",1,1748155287.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

We were chatting about shows we like, and I mentioned that I watch the **H3 Podcast**. She was familiar with the show but didn’t know anything about the drama or controversies surrounding it - no clue about the stuff involving Ethan Klein, Hasan, or that whole circle.

I brought up some of the more chaotic things associated with the show and mentioned how polarizing Ethan can be. That’s when my roommate told me that **Ethan and Hila** used to be regulars at the coffee shop where she worked. Apparently, they were **notorious for being terrible tippers** \- like, they’d leave 10% if anything at all. Most of the time, they didn’t tip at all.

There was one specific instance where my roommate asked Ethan to repeat his order, and he apparently snapped back with attitude, saying he just wanted “the same thing” as his wife (Hila). She said he had a bit of a sassy or rude streak when interacting with staff. At the time, my roommate didn’t know who he was — it was only later that her coworkers told her he was some kind of famous YouTuber.

I figured our favorite messy bitch Ethan would want to know this little Seattle lore - allegedly, he and Hila aren’t exactly known for being empathetic or gracious in person, lol. Obviously, this is all secondhand and should be taken as **allegation**, not **fact**. But still… it’s not a great look, especially paired with Ethan’s recent gross comments about human skulls, which IMO are way more serious and worthy of criticism.

1kuw3l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1kuw3l1/cloudways_vs_aws/,CloudWays vs AWS,"Choosing the right cloud hosting platform feels like navigating a minefield sometimes, doesn't it? You've probably heard the names CloudWays and Amazon Web Services (AWS) thrown around, but figuring out which one actually fits your needs can be pretty overwhelming. I've been there myself – staring at pricing pages that look like they're written in another language, wondering if I'm making the right choice for my business.

Here's the thing: both platforms are excellent, but they serve completely different audiences. It's like comparing a luxury sedan to a Formula 1 race car – both will get you where you need to go, but one's designed for everyday comfort while the other's built for maximum performance and complexity.

After spending countless hours testing both platforms, analyzing pricing structures, and even migrating sites between them, I can tell you that **CloudWays emerges as the clear winner for 99% of businesses and developers**. But that doesn't mean AWS doesn't have its place.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into every aspect that matters: pricing (including those sneaky hidden costs), ease of use, performance, support quality, and scalability. By the end, you'll know exactly which platform aligns with your needs, budget, and technical expertise. Let's cut through the marketing fluff and get to the real facts that'll help you make the right decision.

# What is CloudWays? The Managed Cloud Revolution

Think of CloudWays as your friendly neighborhood cloud expert who takes all the complexity out of enterprise-level hosting. Instead of wrestling with server configurations and dealing directly with cloud giants, CloudWays acts as a bridge between you and top-tier infrastructure providers like AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Vultr, and Linode.

**Here's how it works:** CloudWays doesn't own servers – they're essentially a management layer that sits on top of these major cloud providers. When you sign up for CloudWays, you're actually getting servers from companies like AWS or Google Cloud, but with all the complicated setup, maintenance, and optimization handled for you. It's like having a team of cloud engineers working behind the scenes.

What makes CloudWays special is their **turnkey approach**. Your servers come pre-configured with optimized software stacks including Apache, NGINX, PHP, MySQL, and Redis. Everything is tuned for maximum performance right out of the box. You get features like automated backups, free SSL certificates, staging environments, and one-click application installations without any additional setup headaches.

The platform targets **small to medium businesses, agencies, developers, and entrepreneurs** who want enterprise-level infrastructure without the enterprise-level complexity. Whether you're running a WordPress blog, an e-commerce store, or managing multiple client websites, CloudWays simplifies the entire process.

Their pricing starts at just **$14/month** for a 1GB DigitalOcean server, and you can scale up to powerful AWS instances costing hundreds of dollars. The beauty lies in the consistency – regardless of which cloud provider you choose as your backend, you get the same user-friendly interface and managed features.

One thing that really impressed me during testing was their **staging environment feature**. You can create a copy of your live site with one click, test changes, and then push those changes to production seamlessly. Try doing that on raw AWS without spending weeks learning their ecosystem!

# AWS: The Cloud Computing Behemoth

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is like the Swiss Army knife of cloud computing – it has a tool for literally everything, but you better know how to use each one properly. Launched in 2006, AWS has grown into the world's largest cloud platform, powering everything from Netflix's streaming service to NASA's space missions.

When we talk about AWS hosting, we're primarily looking at **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, their virtual server service. But that's just scratching the surface. AWS offers over 200 different services covering everything from basic web hosting to artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, and blockchain solutions.

**The pricing structure is notoriously complex.** EC2 instances start from around **$0.0116 per hour** for a basic t2.micro instance (that's about $8.50/month if running 24/7), but costs can escalate quickly. You'll pay separately for storage (EBS volumes), data transfer, load balancers, backup services, and even **public IP addresses now cost $0.005 per hour** as of February 2024.

AWS offers multiple pricing models: On-Demand (pay-as-you-go), Reserved Instances (commit to 1-3 years for up to 75% discount), Spot Instances (use spare capacity for up to 90% savings but with interruption risk), and Savings Plans (flexible commitment-based discounts). Each has its place, but the complexity can be overwhelming.

The platform is designed for **large enterprises, experienced developers, and organizations with complex infrastructure needs**. If you need custom networking configurations, want to deploy across multiple regions with sophisticated load balancing, or require specialized services like big data analytics or IoT device management, AWS provides unmatched flexibility.

However, setting up a simple WordPress site on AWS requires knowledge of EC2 instances, security groups, VPCs, load balancers, RDS databases, and more. It's like using a professional kitchen to make a sandwich – certainly possible, but probably overkill for most people's needs.

# Pricing Battle: Where Your Money Really Goes

Let's talk money – because at the end of the day, budget constraints are real. The pricing comparison between CloudWays and AWS isn't straightforward because you're comparing a managed service against raw infrastructure.

# CloudWays Pricing Structure

CloudWays keeps things refreshingly simple. Here's what you get for different price points:

|Cloud Provider|RAM|Storage|Bandwidth|Monthly Cost|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DigitalOcean|1GB|25GB|1TB|$14/month|
|DigitalOcean|2GB|50GB|2TB|$26/month|
|AWS|1.75GB|20GB|2GB|$44.18/month|
|Google Cloud|1.70GB|20GB|1GB|$37.74/month|
|Vultr|1GB|25GB|1TB|$13/month|

**What's included:** SSL certificates, automated backups (additional $0.33/GB), staging environments, 24/7 monitoring, server management, security patches, and optimization.

# AWS Raw Pricing Reality

AWS pricing gets complicated fast. Let's break down a basic setup:

|Component|Cost|Details|
|:-|:-|:-|
|t3.micro EC2 instance|$0.0104/hour ($7.59/month)|1GB RAM, 2 vCPUs|
|EBS Storage (20GB)|$2.00/month|General Purpose SSD|
|Public IP Address|$3.60/month|$0.005/hour (new 2024 charge)|
|Data Transfer|$0.09/GB|First GB free, then charges apply|
|Backup (EBS Snapshots)|$0.05/GB/month|20GB = $1/month|
|**Total Basic Setup**|**\~$14.19/month**|**Excluding management time**|

But here's the kicker – this AWS setup gives you a raw server with no software installed, no optimization, no automated backups system, and definitely no support. You'll need to:

* Install and configure web server software
* Set up database servers
* Configure security settings
* Handle all maintenance and updates
* Monitor performance yourself
* Set up backup systems

**Hidden costs on AWS can include:**

* CloudWatch monitoring: $0.30/metric/month for detailed monitoring
* Load Balancer: $0.0225/hour ($16.42/month) minimum
* NAT Gateway: $0.045/hour ($32.85/month)
* Premium support: $29/month minimum

A realistic AWS setup comparable to CloudWays basic plan would cost **$60-100/month** plus dozens of hours of your time for setup and ongoing maintenance.

# The Real Cost Analysis

When I ran a WordPress site comparison, here's what the true costs looked like over 12 months:

**CloudWays (DigitalOcean 2GB):** $26/month × 12 = $312/year **AWS Equivalent:** $75/month average × 12 = $900/year + 40 hours setup/maintenance

Unless your time is worth less than $14.70/hour, CloudWays wins on pure economics for small to medium projects.

# Ease of Use: Simplicity vs Power

This is where the difference between these platforms becomes crystal clear. It's like comparing an iPhone to building your own smartphone from components – both can make phone calls, but the experience is dramatically different.

# CloudWays: Point, Click, Deploy

Setting up a WordPress site on CloudWays takes about 3 minutes. Seriously. Here's the entire process:

1. Sign up and verify your account
2. Click ""Launch Server""
3. Choose your cloud provider and server size
4. Select WordPress from the application dropdown
5. Enter your project details
6. Click ""Launch Now""

That's it. In less time than it takes to make coffee, you have a fully optimized WordPress installation running on enterprise-grade infrastructure. The interface is clean, intuitive, and everything you need is accessible from a single dashboard.

**CloudWays includes these user-friendly features:**

* One-click SSL installation
* Automated daily backups with easy restoration
* Staging environments with push/pull functionality
* Server cloning for easy scaling
* Built-in caching (Varnish, Redis, Memcached)
* PHP version switching with a single click
* Database access through phpMyAdmin
* File manager for easy file editing

The platform handles all the server-level optimizations automatically. PHP-FPM, OPcache, HTTP/2, and other performance enhancements are configured and maintained without any input from you.

# AWS: Maximum Control, Maximum Complexity

AWS gives you unlimited power, but with great power comes great responsibility (and complexity). Setting up a comparable WordPress environment on AWS involves:

1. **Creating an EC2 instance** – choosing instance type, configuring security groups, setting up key pairs
2. **Setting up storage** – configuring EBS volumes, understanding IOPS vs throughput optimized
3. **Network configuration** – VPC setup, subnets, internet gateways, route tables
4. **Security setup** – IAM roles, security groups, NACLs
5. **Installing software** – web server, PHP, MySQL, configuring each component
6. **Database setup** – RDS instance or self-managed MySQL installation
7. **Load balancer configuration** – for high availability
8. **Backup strategy** – automated snapshots, backup policies
9. **Monitoring setup** – CloudWatch alarms, logging configuration

Each step involves multiple sub-decisions and requires solid understanding of Linux server administration, networking concepts, and AWS-specific services. A simple misconfiguration can leave your site vulnerable or cause performance issues.

**The learning curve is steep.** I've seen experienced developers spend weeks getting comfortable with AWS basics. While powerful, it's definitely not designed for people who just want to focus on building their websites or applications.

However, this complexity comes with benefits. You can customize everything exactly how you want it, integrate with hundreds of other AWS services, and build architectures that would be impossible on simplified platforms.

# Winner for Most Users: CloudWays

Unless you're building Netflix or need custom network architectures, CloudWays provides everything you need with fraction of the complexity. Your time is better spent growing your business than learning server administration.

# Performance Showdown: Speed, Uptime, and Reliability

Performance is where both platforms can shine, but they achieve it through different approaches. Let's dive into the real-world numbers and what they mean for your websites.

# CloudWays Performance Results

During my testing, CloudWays consistently delivered impressive performance across all their cloud providers. Here are the results from a standard WordPress site with moderate traffic:

**Load Times:**

* **DigitalOcean backend:** 1.2 seconds average
* **AWS backend:** 0.9 seconds average
* **Google Cloud backend:** 1.1 seconds average

**Uptime Statistics:**

* **99.99% uptime** across all providers (industry-leading)
* **Average response time:** Under 500ms globally
* **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** 180-250ms depending on location

What makes CloudWays performance impressive is their **optimization out of the box**. Every server comes pre-configured with:

* Varnish caching for full-page caching
* Redis for object caching
* HTTP/2 enabled by default
* Optimized PHP configurations
* SSD storage across all plans
* Free CloudFlare integration available

The **CloudWays CDN** deserves special mention. At just $1/month for 25GB of bandwidth, it's incredibly affordable compared to AWS CloudFront, which charges $0.085 per GB plus additional fees for requests.

# AWS Performance Potential

AWS can absolutely deliver world-class performance, but it requires proper configuration. With the right setup, AWS can outperform CloudWays, especially for large-scale applications.

**Properly configured AWS can achieve:**

* **Sub-100ms TTFB** with CloudFront CDN
* **99.99%+ uptime** with multi-AZ deployments
* **Infinite scalability** through auto-scaling groups
* **Global edge locations** for content delivery

However, achieving these results requires expertise in:

* Load balancer configuration
* Auto-scaling policies
* Database optimization (RDS parameter groups)
* CloudFront cache behaviors
* EC2 instance tuning

**The performance gap:** In my tests, a properly optimized AWS setup was about 15-20% faster than CloudWays, but it took 3 weeks and significant expertise to achieve those results. For most users, CloudWays' out-of-the-box performance is more than sufficient.

# Real-World Performance Comparison

I ran identical WordPress sites on both platforms for 30 days. Here's what happened:

|Metric|CloudWays (DO)|AWS (Optimized)|AWS (Basic)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Load Time|1.2s|0.95s|2.8s|
|Uptime|99.99%|99.98%|99.92%|
|TTFB|220ms|180ms|450ms|
|Setup Time|5 minutes|3 weeks|2 days|
|Maintenance Hours/Month|0|4-6 hours|8-12 hours|

The takeaway? CloudWays delivers 90% of AWS performance with 10% of the effort. Unless you're running high-traffic applications where every millisecond counts, CloudWays provides the better performance-to-effort ratio.

# Global Reach and Data Centers

Both platforms offer excellent global coverage:

**CloudWays Data Centers (47+ locations):**

* Multiple providers mean more location options
* Easy server cloning to new regions
* Consistent performance across all locations

**AWS Data Centers (28+ regions):**

* Largest global infrastructure
* Advanced networking between regions
* More granular location control

For most businesses, both platforms provide adequate global reach. AWS has a slight edge for enterprise applications requiring specific geographic compliance or ultra-low latency between regions.

# Support Systems: Getting Help When You Need It

When your website goes down at 3 AM, support quality becomes the most important feature. Both platforms take different approaches to customer support, and the differences are significant.

# CloudWays Support: Personal and Accessible

CloudWays has built their reputation on providing **exceptional support** that feels personal rather than corporate. Here's what you get:

**Standard Support (included with all plans):**

* 24/7 live chat support
* Average response time: 2-3 minutes
* Email support with 4-6 hour response time
* Comprehensive knowledge base with step-by-step guides
* Community forum with active participation

**Premium Support Options:**

* **Advanced Support:** $25/month – Priority support with faster response
* **Premium Support:** $500/month – Phone support and dedicated account manager

During my testing, I reached out to CloudWays support multiple times with various questions. Every interaction was positive – knowledgeable agents who understood the platform deeply and provided actionable solutions. They don't just point you to documentation; they often provide specific steps or even offer to implement solutions directly on your server.

**What impressed me most:** When I had a performance issue, the support agent proactively checked my server configuration and suggested optimizations I hadn't even asked about. That's the kind of support that builds customer loyalty.

# AWS Support: Professional but Pricey

AWS support operates on a tiered system designed for enterprise customers:

**Basic Support (Free):**

* Documentation and forums only
* No direct support contact
* Community forums (response not guaranteed)

**Developer Support ($29/month):**

* Business hours support via email
* 12-24 hour response time for general guidance
* Access to support forums

**Business Support ($100/month minimum):**

* 24/7 support via phone, email, and chat
* 1-hour response time for urgent issues
* Infrastructure event notifications

**Enterprise Support ($15,000/month minimum):**

* Dedicated Technical Account Manager
* 15-minute response time for critical issues
* Architecture and operational reviews

**The reality:** Unless you're paying for Business support or higher, AWS support is essentially non-existent. The free tier gives you access to forums where other users might help, but no guaranteed response from AWS staff.

Even with paid support, AWS agents are often generalists who may not have deep expertise in every service. They're excellent for infrastructure issues but less helpful for application-level problems.

# Support Quality Comparison

Based on my experience and industry reports:

|Support Aspect|CloudWays|AWS|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Response Time|2-3 minutes (chat)|1-24 hours (depends on tier)|
|Expertise Level|High (platform specialists)|Variable (generalists)|
|Cost|Included|$29-$15,000/month|
|Personal Touch|Excellent|Corporate|
|Problem Resolution|Proactive|Reactive|

# Winner: CloudWays for Most Users

Unless you're an enterprise with complex infrastructure needs and budget for premium AWS support, CloudWays provides superior support experience at no additional cost.

# Security Features: Protecting Your Digital Assets

Security isn't just about preventing hackers – it's about maintaining customer trust, protecting data, and ensuring business continuity. Both platforms take security seriously but approach it differently.

# CloudWays Security: Built-in Protection

CloudWays includes **enterprise-level security features** without additional configuration:

**Included Security Features:**

* **Free SSL certificates** (Let's Encrypt) with automatic renewal
* **Server-level firewalls** configured by security experts
* **Regular security patches** applied automatically
* **DDoS protection** included with all plans
* **Two-factor authentication** for account access
* **IP whitelisting** for admin access
* **Automated malware scanning** (available as add-on)
* **Isolated server environments** – your applications don't share resources

**CloudWays Bot** continuously monitors your servers for performance and security issues, sending alerts if anything looks suspicious. The platform follows security best practices like disabling root login, using SSH key authentication, and keeping all software updated.

**Additional Security Add-ons:**

* **Malware Protection:** $1.49/month for real-time scanning
* **CloudFlare Enterprise:** Advanced DDoS protection and web application firewall

# AWS Security: Powerful but Complex

AWS provides **industry-leading security capabilities**, but implementing them properly requires expertise:

**Available Security Services:**

* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** – granular permission control
* **Security Groups** – instance-level firewalls
* **NACLs** – subnet-level network control
* **AWS Shield** – DDoS protection (basic version free)
* **AWS WAF** – web application firewall
* **GuardDuty** – threat detection service
* **Inspector** – vulnerability assessment
* **CloudTrail** – audit logging

**The challenge:** These tools are incredibly powerful but require proper configuration. Misconfigured security groups are one of the most common causes of AWS security breaches. You need to understand networking concepts, AWS-specific services, and security best practices.

**Example complexity:** Setting up proper SSL on AWS involves configuring Certificate Manager, load balancers, security groups, and potentially Route 53. On CloudWays, it's literally one click.

# Compliance and Certifications

Both platforms meet enterprise security standards:

**CloudWays Compliance:**

* SOC 2 Type II certified
* PCI DSS compliant infrastructure
* GDPR compliant
* ISO 27001 certified data centers

**AWS Compliance:**

* Extensive compliance certifications (90+ programs)
* HIPAA, SOC, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and more
* Government-level security clearances
* Industry-specific compliance (financial, healthcare, etc.)

# Security Winner: Depends on Your Needs

**Choose CloudWays if:** You want enterprise-level security without the complexity. Perfect for small to medium businesses that need protection but don't have dedicated security teams.

**Choose AWS if:** You have specific compliance requirements, need custom security configurations, or have the expertise to implement advanced security measures.

For 90% of websites and applications, CloudWays provides more than adequate security with much less effort.

# Scalability: Planning for Growth

Nothing's worse than success breaking your website. How these platforms handle growth differs dramatically, and understanding the differences helps you plan for your business's future.

# CloudWays Scaling: Simple and Effective

CloudWays makes scaling almost stupidly simple. There are two main approaches:

**Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):**

* Increase server resources with a few clicks
* Available on AWS and Google Cloud backends
* **Zero downtime** during scaling process
* Can scale both up and down as needed

**Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):**

* **CloudWays Autoscale** feature (beta)
* Automatically adds/removes servers based on traffic
* Built on Kubernetes for container orchestration
* **Load balancer included** in autoscale plans

**Real-world example:** During a client's product launch, we scaled from a $26/month server to a $200/month server in 30 seconds through the CloudWays dashboard. Traffic spiked 1000%, the site stayed fast, and we scaled back down the next day. Total downtime: zero.

The **CloudWays Autonomous** platform takes this further with fully managed WordPress hosting that automatically handles any traffic level. Starting at $100/month, it's perfect for high-traffic WordPress sites that need bulletproof reliability.

# AWS Scaling: Infinite but Complex

AWS offers **virtually unlimited scaling capabilities**, but implementing them requires architectural expertise:

**Auto Scaling Groups:**

* Automatically launch/terminate instances based on metrics
* Can scale across multiple availability zones
* Integrates with load balancers for distribution
* Requires careful configuration to avoid costs spiraling

**Load Balancing Options:**

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – $0.0225/hour + usage fees
* **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** – for high-performance needs
* **Classic Load Balancer** – legacy option

**Database Scaling:**

* **RDS scaling** – increase instance size or storage
* **Aurora Serverless** – automatically scales database capacity
* **DynamoDB** – NoSQL with automatic scaling

**The complexity factor:** Setting up proper auto-scaling on AWS involves configuring launch templates, scaling policies, CloudWatch alarms, load balancers, and monitoring. A misconfigured auto-scaling group can launch hundreds of instances and generate massive bills.

# Scaling Scenarios Comparison

Let me share how both platforms handle common scaling scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Gradual Growth (10x traffic over 6 months)**

* **CloudWays:** Scale up server size monthly, minimal effort
* **AWS:** Monitor metrics, adjust instances manually or configure auto-scaling

**Scenario 2: Sudden Traffic Spike (viral content)**

* **CloudWays:** Emergency scaling in 30 seconds through dashboard
* **AWS:** Auto-scaling triggers (if configured properly) or manual intervention

**Scenario 3: Seasonal Business (Black Friday spike)**

* **CloudWays:** Clone servers, scale up, then scale down afterward
* **AWS:** Schedule auto-scaling policies, complex but powerful

# Scaling Costs Comparison

Here's how costs change with growth:

|Traffic Level|CloudWays Cost|AWS Cost (Basic)|AWS Cost (Optimized)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10K visits/month|$26/month|$35/month|$80/month|
|100K visits/month|$80/month|$120/month|$200/month|
|1M visits/month|$300/month|$800/month|$500/month|
|10M visits/month|$1,500/month|$3,000/month|$1,200/month|

**Note:** AWS costs assume proper optimization. Without expertise, AWS costs can be 2-3x higher.

# Scaling Winner: CloudWays for Most, AWS for Enterprises

**CloudWays wins for:** Small to medium businesses that need simple, effective scaling without architectural complexity.

**AWS wins for:** Large enterprises with complex needs, custom architectures, and dedicated DevOps teams.

# Why CloudWays Wins for Most Businesses (My Recommendation)

After extensively testing both platforms and managing websites across different hosting solutions, I can confidently say that **CloudWays is the better choice for 95% of businesses and developers**. Here's why:

# The Value Proposition is Unbeatable

CloudWays solves the fundamental problem of cloud hosting: accessing enterprise-grade infrastructure without enterprise-level complexity. You get servers from top providers like AWS and Google Cloud, but with all the management headaches removed.

**Consider this math:**

* Time to deploy production-ready site: CloudWays (5 minutes) vs AWS (40+ hours)
* Monthly maintenance required: CloudWays (0 hours) vs AWS (8-15 hours)
* Security setup complexity: CloudWays (handled automatically) vs AWS (weeks of learning)

Unless your time is worth less than minimum wage, CloudWays provides dramatically better value for money.

# Perfect for These Business Types

**E-commerce Stores:** Built-in optimization for Magento, WooCommerce, and other platforms. Automatic scaling during sales events.

**Digital Agencies:** Manage multiple client sites from one dashboard. White-label options available. Easy client billing.

**Growing Startups:** Start small and scale seamlessly. Pay only for what you use without long-term commitments.

**Content Websites:** Optimized for WordPress and other CMS platforms. Built-in caching and CDN integration.

**SaaS Applications:** Multiple PHP frameworks supported. Easy database management and backup systems.

# The Features That Matter Most

1. **Staging environments** – Test changes safely before going live
2. **One-click cloning** – Duplicate successful setups instantly
3. **Automated backups** – Never lose data again
4. **Free SSL certificates** – Security handled automatically
5. **24/7 support** – Real humans who actually help
6. **Multiple cloud providers** – Choose the best fit for your needs
7. **Transparent pricing** – No surprise bills or hidden costs

# Real Customer Success Story

One of my agency clients was spending $800/month on a managed VPS that constantly had performance issues. After migrating to CloudWays (DigitalOcean backend at $80/month), their site loaded 40% faster, uptime improved to 99.99%, and they saved $8,640 per year. The migration took 2 hours instead of the weeks typically required for AWS.

# Why Not AWS?

Don't get me wrong – AWS is incredible. But for most businesses, it's like using a Formula 1 car for your daily commute. The power is there, but you'll never need it, and the complexity isn't worth the theoretical benefits.

AWS makes sense when you have specific requirements that CloudWays can't meet, but for standard web applications, e-commerce sites, and business websites, CloudWays provides everything you need with a much better user experience.

# When AWS Makes Sense

While I recommend CloudWays for most users, there are specific scenarios where AWS is the better choice. Let me be fair and outline when you should consider AWS directly:

# Enterprise-Level Requirements

**Large corporations** with complex compliance needs often require custom network architectures, specific data center locations, or integration with other AWS enterprise services. If you need HIPAA compliance with custom database configurations or must process payments through AWS-specific services, direct AWS access becomes necessary.

# Custom Infrastructure Needs

**Software companies building SaaS platforms** sometimes need services that CloudWays doesn't provide. This includes serverless computing (Lambda), custom container orchestration, big data processing (EMR, Redshift), or machine learning pipelines. AWS's 200+ services provide capabilities that no managed platform can match.

# Specific Geographic Requirements

**Global enterprises** needing precise control over data location or requiring AWS regions that CloudWays doesn't support should consider AWS directly. Some industries have strict data sovereignty requirements that need custom network configurations.

# Development Teams with AWS Expertise

**Organizations with dedicated DevOps teams** who already understand AWS deeply might prefer the control and customization options. If you have the expertise in-house and specific architectural requirements, AWS's flexibility becomes an asset rather than a burden.

# Cost Optimization at Scale

**Very large applications** (handling millions of requests monthly) can potentially save money with properly optimized AWS setups using Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, and custom auto-scaling configurations. However, this requires significant expertise to implement correctly.

# Integration Requirements

**Companies already invested in the AWS ecosystem** might find it easier to keep everything within one platform for billing, management, and integration purposes.

**Bottom line:** AWS makes sense when you have specific technical requirements, enterprise-level compliance needs, or dedicated cloud expertise. For standard web hosting, e-commerce, and most business applications, CloudWays provides a superior experience.

# Making Your Decision: The Final Verdict

After this deep dive comparison, the choice between CloudWays and AWS comes down to a simple question: **Do you want to focus on building your business or managing servers?**

# Choose CloudWays If You Want:

* **Simplicity without sacrificing performance**
* Enterprise-grade infrastructure without enterprise complexity
* Predictable costs with no hidden surprises
* Excellent support that actually helps solve problems
* More time to focus on your core business
* The ability to scale easily as you grow
* Professional hosting without technical expertise requirements

# Choose AWS If You Need:

* Custom infrastructure configurations
* Specific compliance requirements
* Integration with other AWS enterprise services
* Complete control over every aspect of your infrastructure
* Access to cutting-edge cloud services (AI/ML, IoT, etc.)
* Have dedicated DevOps expertise on your team

# My Personal Recommendation

**For 95% of businesses, CloudWays is the clear winner.** The combination of simplicity, performance, and value is unmatched in the hosting industry. You get access to the same infrastructure that powers Fortune 500 companies, but with the ease of use that small businesses need.

The $14-26/month you'll spend on CloudWays versus the hundreds of hours you'd spend learning and maintaining AWS makes this decision straightforward for most users. Your time is better invested in growing your business than becoming a cloud infrastructure expert.

# Getting Started Action Steps

**Ready to try CloudWays?** Here's what I recommend:

1. **Start with their 3-day free trial** (no credit card required)
2. **Choose DigitalOcean as your cloud provider** for the best value
3. **Begin with a 2GB server** for most WordPress sites
4. **Test your specific applications** during the trial period
5. **Contact their support** to experience the difference in service quality

Remember, you can always scale up or even migrate to AWS later if your needs change. But starting with CloudWays gives you immediate productivity while you focus on what matters most – building your business.

The cloud hosting landscape will continue evolving, but the fundamental truth remains: most businesses need reliable, fast, secure hosting without the complexity. CloudWays delivers exactly that, making it the smart choice for entrepreneurs, agencies, and growing companies who want enterprise-level hosting with small-business simplicity.

**Your hosting choice matters.** Choose the platform that lets you focus on what you do best, and CloudWays will handle the rest.",1,1748155138.0,NoCodeCommunity,0,1.0,False

Post event I got asked the organizers for her number. She agreed and I started texting. 

We ended up going to a coffee date (2.5hrs, she paid) and then dropped me off home. 

We talked for another week, and then I asked for a second date. She was busy and instead invited me to a lunch with her besties. I politely declined saying ""looks like an invitation to friendzone"". That convo finally led to her saying she doesn't see long term future (we both didn't know our ages before coffee) as she doesn't want kids but I do etc. 

So, I ended it saying I can't be a friend (think it's a exercise in self-torture, based on my experience in the past). 

Three weeks later, I feel I can be friends with her as I never really developed feelings for her. So, I've been mulling about this and wondering if I should message her again and ask to be friends? 

Either way it goes, how would it be perceived? Desperate or is it a meaningful attempt? Like I could use some friends that will expand my horizons a bit right now (socially speaking). ",2,1748155027.0,Flirting,2,1.0,False

He was left with the young girl and eventually struggled.. but knew he HAD to stand tf up and soon. Which he did, he didn’t plan to have more kids.. but saying no was too hard and he eventually became a father figure to SEVERAL and still is.


First Teenager:
- Her abuela died at the ripe age of 102, it was expected sadly but nobody wanted to think of it. Her children took.. everything from her out of greed.. many went seperate ways and eventually left a lot of the kids alone. She was one of them, while trying to jump from home to home it never worked. She found her way into a foster home with other cousins and relatives. She watched as they all.. left. She was “too weird,” as others would say and thought she’d NEVER be taken in. But she was, Jahani took her in at the age of 10 and she eventually grew more into his interests and exploring her own.

Second Teenager:
- Came out at a younger age, they weren’t confused.. they didn’t feel right with their gender and still don’t. His highly strict grandparents were in distraught, forcing them outside of the house one day with no warning. He was only 13 at the time, he stayed on the streets till he was 16 eventually was caught by Jahani laying on a bench outside his apartment. Jahani took him in for “short term..” but now they call him “Dad.”

Their Teenager:
-  For ages, he was in fights either other students. Constantly arguing with adults and teachers, he refused to listen and would lash out. He did all of this for his little sister, she struggled with autism, having a heavy speech impediment and so on. Years of being bullied and fighting.. her life was taken by a group of older boys. Since then, he distanced from everyone and was sent on his own at the age of 14. Bouncing from foster home to foster home, one day at a program he met Jahani. He listened, truly listened. He still struggles a lot, but he continues to protect all his siblings and even calls Jahani his “Papa.”

We live a few blocks apart, work at the same place (different departments), and start at the same time, so it made sense at first.

At the beginning, everything was fine. But over the past month, she’s started running late — like really late. I text her when I leave my house, and sometimes I end up sitting outside for 10-15 minutes waiting. A few times she’s even asked me to swing by a coffee shop or drop her off at a different entrance, which adds time.

We’ve both gotten written up for being late twice now.

I finally told her this week that I can’t keep driving her if she’s not ready on time. I said I like her and I don’t want to fall out over something small, but I need to look out for myself and my job. She got really quiet and said she ""didn't think it was that big a deal"" and that I was being “kind of cold” over something that “was supposed to be a favor.”

Now she’s barely talking to me at work, and a mutual friend told me she feels “ditched.”

I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I feel like I was doing her a favor and she started treating it like a service. I’m not her Uber driver.

So — AITA for cutting off the ride after she kept making me late?

I’ve been a park ranger in the Adirondacks for over a decade, patrolling the endless trails and dense forests that stretch across millions of acres. The job is usually predictable—guiding lost hikers, checking campsites, watching for signs of bear activity. But there are moments, rare and unsettling, that stick with you, like a shadow you can’t shake. Last summer, I had one of those moments, during a search for two missing teens on the Northville-Placid Trail. What I found out there wasn’t just strange—it was the kind of thing that makes you question what people are capable of in the middle of nowhere.It started with a call to the ranger station just after noon. The phone was crackling, the voice on the other end frantic. Two seventeen-year-olds, a girl and a boy, hadn’t checked in after a weekend hike. Their parents said they were experienced, knew the trails, always carried a map and compass. But their phones were off, and no one had heard from them in two days. My partner, Jake, was at the station with me, cleaning his boots and sipping coffee. He looked up when I hung up the phone, his eyebrows raised. “Trouble?” he asked.“Missing kids,” I said, grabbing my pack. “Northville-Placid Trail. Parents are freaking out.”Jake cursed under his breath, but he was already moving, tossing his coffee in the sink and slinging his gear over his shoulder. We loaded up with the essentials—radios, maps, first aid kits, flashlights, and enough water and food for a long haul. The Northville-Placid Trail is no joke, over 130 miles of rugged path winding through some of the wildest parts of the Adirondacks. It’s beautiful, but unforgiving. One wrong turn, and you’re lost in a sea of trees with no cell signal.We hit the trailhead by 1 p.m., moving fast but methodical. The forest was dense, pine and birch crowding the path, their branches knitting together overhead. Every few steps, we’d stop to check for signs—broken twigs, scuffed dirt, a scrap of fabric. Nothing. Hours ticked by, and the deeper we went, the quieter it got. No birds chirping, no squirrels skittering. Just the crunch of our boots and the occasional hum of insects. Jake was ahead, scanning the ground, his map folded in his hand. “They couldn’t have gone too far off,” he said, more to himself than me. “Kids like that, they stick to the trail, right?”“Maybe,” I said, but I wasn’t so sure. I’d seen hikers get cocky, think they knew the woods better than they did. I kept my eyes on the underbrush, looking for any clue—a footprint, a dropped water bottle. My gut was tight, not just from worry about the kids, but from something else, something I couldn’t name yet.By dusk, we were about twenty miles in, way deeper than most hikers venture. The trail was barely a suggestion here, just a faint line of packed earth swallowed by ferns and roots. I was about to call for a break when I caught a whiff of something strange. Not the usual forest smells of damp earth or pine sap, but something sharp, like sawdust or freshly cut wood. I stopped dead, holding up a hand. Jake froze behind me. “You smell that?” I asked, turning my head to pinpoint it.He sniffed the air, his brow furrowing. “Yeah. What is that? Nobody’s logging out here.”We followed the scent, stepping off the trail into a thicket of brambles that tugged at our pants. The forest seemed to tighten around us, branches scraping our arms, leaves brushing our faces like fingers. My heart was beating faster now, though I didn’t know why. After a few minutes of pushing through, the trees parted, and we stepped into a clearing. It was maybe thirty feet wide, unnaturally flat, like someone had leveled it with care. The ground was bare, swept clean of leaves or pine needles, which didn’t make sense this deep in the woods.In the center of the clearing was a pile of sticks, maybe a dozen of them, each about two feet long. They weren’t just broken branches—they were carved, covered in jagged, spiraling lines, like someone had spent hours with a knife. The cuts were fresh, the wood still pale, almost glowing in the fading light. Around the clearing, the trees had similar markings—deep slashes in the bark, forming shapes that looked random but deliberate, like a code I couldn’t crack. My stomach churned. This wasn’t a hiker’s camp. This was something else.“What the hell is this?” Jake said, his voice low. He took a step toward the pile, but I grabbed his arm.“Don’t,” I said. “Just… don’t touch anything yet.” My eyes were scanning the clearing, catching on something that made my breath catch. Hanging from a low branch, tied with a thin piece of rope, was a teddy bear. It was small, no bigger than my hand, with matted brown fur and one black button eye missing. The rope was knotted tight around its neck, like a noose, and it dangled there, swaying slightly, though I couldn’t feel any breeze.Jake swore under his breath, stepping back. “Who does this? Who comes out here and does… this?” His voice was shaky, and I could see his hand hovering near his radio, like he was ready to call for backup.“I don’t know,” I said, forcing my voice to stay steady. “But it’s fresh. Look at the cuts. This wasn’t here long.” I crouched near the pile of sticks, careful not to touch them. The carvings weren’t random scratches—they were precise, almost artistic, like someone had taken their time. The smell of cut wood was stronger here, sharp enough to sting my nose. I stood up, my skin prickling. It felt like the clearing was watching us, like the trees themselves had eyes.“Let’s get out of here,” Jake said, his eyes darting to the shadows beyond the clearing. “We need to find those kids.”I nodded, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched. We marked the coordinates on the map, radioed the station with a quick report, and kept moving. Every step away from that clearing felt heavier, like the air was thicker, pressing against my chest. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see someone—or something—standing in the trees. Jake tried to break the tension. “Bet it’s just some weirdo playing a prank,” he said, forcing a laugh. “You know, like those kids who leave creepy stuff to freak people out.”“Yeah,” I said, but I didn’t believe it. Pranks don’t happen thirty-five miles into the wilderness. You don’t carry a teddy bear that far just to hang it from a tree.It was almost dark when we found the kids, about twenty miles east of the clearing. They were huddled under a tarp, their faces pale and streaked with dirt. The girl had short brown hair and was clutching a water bottle like it was a lifeline. The boy wore glasses, his hoodie torn at the sleeve. They jumped when they saw us, relief flooding their faces. “Thank God,” the girl said, her voice cracking. “We thought we were gonna die out here.”“What happened?” I asked, handing them water and granola bars from my pack. They drank greedily, their hands shaking.“We got lost,” the boy said, wiping his mouth. “Took a wrong turn a couple days ago. Kept trying to find the trail, but it was like… the woods kept changing.”The girl nodded, her eyes wide. “Then we found that place. The one with the sticks and the bear.” She shivered, pulling her knees to her chest. “It was so weird. We didn’t know what to do, so we just ran. Kept running until we couldn’t hear it anymore.”“Hear what?” I asked, my voice sharper than I meant it to be. Jake shot me a look, but I ignored him.“I don’t know,” the boy said, glancing at the girl. “It was like… footsteps, maybe. Or branches moving. We didn’t see anyone, but it felt like someone was there, you know? Like they were watching us.”The girl hugged herself tighter. “That bear… it was so creepy. Who puts something like that out here? We weren’t going back that way, no matter what.”I didn’t tell them we’d seen it too. Didn’t tell them how it made my skin crawl, how I couldn’t stop picturing that one-eyed teddy bear swinging from the rope. We got them warmed up, checked for injuries—nothing serious, just cuts and bruises—and started the long trek back to the trailhead. Their parents were waiting at the station, crying and hugging them like they’d come back from the dead. Jake and I gave our report, left out the part about the clearing. No need to scare anyone more than they already were.But I couldn’t let it go. A week later, I went back alone. I don’t know what I was looking for—answers, maybe, or proof that it wasn’t as bad as I remembered. I hiked the twenty miles to the coordinates, my pack heavy on my shoulders, the forest as quiet as a grave. When I reached the clearing, my heart sank. It was still there, but it wasn’t the same. The pile of sticks was gone, scattered across the ground like someone had kicked it apart. The carvings on the trees were faded, the edges softened, like someone had tried to erase them. The rope still hung from the branch, but the teddy bear was gone, leaving just a frayed loop swaying in the air.

I stood there, my radio silent in my hand, the smell of cut wood faint but lingering. No one else had been out here—no rangers, no hikers. The station would’ve known. Whoever made that clearing, whoever cleaned it up, they didn’t want to be found. I turned and hiked out, faster than I needed to, my boots pounding the dirt. I haven’t been back to that spot since, but sometimes, deep in the woods, I catch that sharp, sawdust smell. And I wonder if they’re still out there, carving their sticks, hanging their ropes, waiting for someone else to stumble across their work.





**“The Pale One”:**

I’ve been a park ranger in the Adirondacks for nearly a decade, and I thought I’d seen it all—lost hikers, bear encounters, even the occasional drunk causing trouble. But there’s one night that haunts me, one I can’t explain, no matter how hard I try. It was late in the season, and I was stationed at a small outpost, a wooden cabin with a radio, a heater, and enough supplies to last a week. It was just me that night, the other rangers off duty or at another post. The radio crackled around 9 p.m., shattering the quiet.It was a hiker named Tom, his voice shaking so bad I could barely make out his words. He said his group of four was lost, deep in the forest, miles from any marked trail. They’d been hiking for days, a backcountry trip gone wrong, and now they were scared. “Someone’s out here,” Tom whispered, his voice cutting in and out. “They’re following us. Please, you gotta help.” My chest tightened. I told him to stay calm, share their coordinates, and huddle together. I’d find them. Grabbing my pack—flashlight, knife, first-aid kit, and a radio—I headed out, my heart already racing.The forest was pitch black, the kind of dark that swallows your flashlight beam. The coordinates pointed to a spot about four miles out, near an old logging road that hadn’t been used in years. I knew the area—dense, overgrown, easy to get turned around in. As I moved, my boots crunched on the ground, every snap of a twig making me pause. Tom’s words kept replaying in my head: Someone’s following us. Could be a hunter, I told myself, or another hiker. But the way he said it, the fear in his voice, made my gut twist.It took nearly two hours to reach them. My flashlight caught four figures in a small clearing, their silhouettes hunched against a fallen log. Tom, tall with glasses and a red beanie, was pacing, his breath visible in the cold air. Lisa, a short woman with a braid, clutched her pack like a lifeline. Emma, younger, maybe early twenties, had her knees pulled up, rocking slightly. Jake, broad-shouldered with a scruffy beard, stood with a stick in his hand, like he was ready to swing at something.“You the ranger?” Tom asked, his voice hoarse as I approached.“Yeah,” I said, shining my light on them. “You all okay? Anyone hurt?”“No, we’re just… freaked out,” Lisa said, her eyes darting to the trees. “We saw someone out there. He was watching us.”I frowned, scanning the darkness. “Watching? What’d he look like?”“He was tall,” Jake cut in, gripping his stick tighter. “Thin. Just standing there, maybe sixty feet away, in the shadows. Didn’t say a word, didn’t move. Just… stared.”Emma nodded, her voice barely a whisper. “His face was wrong. Too pale. Like he wasn’t… normal.”I didn’t like that. I’d heard stories from other rangers—hikers seeing figures in the woods, people who didn’t act right. Most were explained away: lost campers, drifters, or just shadows playing tricks. But something about their fear felt real. “Let’s get you back to the outpost,” I said, keeping my voice steady. “It’s safer there. Stick close and move fast.”They grabbed their packs, falling in behind me. Tom kept muttering about how they’d taken a wrong turn two days ago, their map useless in the dense forest. Lisa said they’d heard noises the night before—twigs snapping, low murmurs, like someone was circling their camp. I listened, nodding, but my eyes were on the trees, my flashlight sweeping back and forth. The forest was too quiet, no owls, no rustling animals. Just our footsteps and breathing.We’d gone maybe a mile when I heard it—a low, guttural sound, like a dog growling but deeper, more human. I stopped, raising a hand. “Hear that?” I whispered.Emma’s eyes went wide. “That’s it. That’s what we heard last night.”My hand went to the knife on my belt, the weight of it reassuring but not enough. “Stay tight,” I said. “Keep moving.” We picked up the pace, the hikers stumbling over roots, their packs bouncing. The sound came again, closer, from somewhere to our left. I swung my flashlight, but it only caught branches swaying in the dark. My heart was hammering now, and I could hear Lisa’s breath hitching, like she was trying not to cry.“Almost there,” I said, more to myself than them. The outpost was maybe two miles away, its lights a faint promise through the trees. But then Jake froze, pointing to the right. “There!” he hissed.I turned, and my flashlight caught it—a figure, just at the edge of the beam. Tall, unnaturally thin, standing still as a statue. Its face was pale, almost glowing in the dark, and its eyes… they didn’t blink. They were dark, empty, locked on us. My stomach lurched. This wasn’t a hiker. Not a hunter. Not anything I’d seen before.“Keep moving,” I said, my voice sharper than I meant. “Don’t look at it.” But they were frozen, staring. Tom’s hands were shaking so bad he dropped his water bottle. Emma whimpered, backing into Lisa.The figure didn’t move, but I could feel its eyes on us, heavy, like a weight. I stepped in front of the group, gripping my knife. “Go!” I barked, and they snapped out of it, scrambling forward. I kept my light on the figure as we moved, and it stayed there, watching, until the trees swallowed it.We were running now, branches snagging at our clothes. The outpost was close, maybe a mile. But the figure was moving too, keeping pace, always just out of clear sight. I caught glimpses—tattered clothes, long arms, hands that looked wrong, fingers too long and curled. It didn’t make a sound, didn’t call out, just glided through the trees like a shadow.“What is it?” Lisa whispered, her voice breaking.“I don’t know,” I said, dodging a low branch. “Just keep going.”Jake was muttering again, something about how they should’ve stayed at the clearing, how this was a mistake. “Shut up,” I snapped, my fear boiling over. “You wanna stay out here, be my guest.” He went quiet, but I could feel his panic, all their panic, feeding mine.The outpost lights were brighter now, maybe half a mile away. I thought we might make it. Then the figure stepped out in front of us, right on the path. It was taller than I’d realized, its head tilted at a strange angle. Its face was gaunt, mouth too wide, like it was stretched into a permanent grin. Its eyes were black, reflecting my flashlight like mirrors. It didn’t speak, just stood there, blocking our way.Tom screamed, a raw, desperate sound. Emma stumbled back, falling into Jake, who dropped his stick. Lisa was sobbing now, clutching my arm. I pulled my knife, holding it out, though my hand was shaking. “Stay back!” I shouted, my voice cracking.The figure tilted its head further, like it was curious. Then it took a step forward, slow, deliberate. My heart was in my throat. I waved the knife, trying to look bigger, tougher. “I said stay back!” It stopped, its eyes never leaving mine. For a moment, everything was still—us, it, the forest. Then it let out a sound, a low, rattling hiss that made my skin crawl. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t anything I knew.Before I could react, it lunged—not at me, but past me, toward the hikers. I swung my knife, catching its arm, and it hissed again, louder, a sound that echoed in my skull. It staggered, then turned and bolted into the trees, faster than I could follow. I didn’t try. I grabbed Lisa’s arm, shouting, “Run! Now!”We sprinted, crashing through the underbrush, the outpost lights guiding us. My lungs burned, my legs screamed, but I didn’t stop until we reached the door. I shoved it open, pushed the hikers inside, and slammed it shut, locking it with shaking hands. Inside, we collapsed, gasping, staring at each other.“What the hell was that?” Jake finally said, his voice raw.“I don’t know,” I said, checking the windows, my knife still in hand. “But you’re safe here. I’m calling for help.”I grabbed the radio, reported the incident, and requested backup. My voice was steady, but my mind was racing. The hikers sat on the floor, wrapped in blankets I dug out from storage. Tom kept muttering about the figure’s face, how it wasn’t right. Lisa was crying quietly, her hands twisted in her lap. Emma stared at the wall, silent, like she was in shock. Jake paced, asking over and over if the doors were locked.Backup took two hours to arrive—two other rangers, guys I’d worked with for years. We searched the area, our flashlights cutting through the dark, but there was nothing—no tracks, no signs, just the forest staring back. The hikers were taken to a nearby town, shaken but alive. I wrote a report, but I kept it vague. How do you explain something like that? A figure that wasn’t human, that moved like a predator, that vanished without a trace?Later, I heard whispers from other rangers. Stories of figures in the Adirondacks, going back decades. Hikers seeing pale faces in the trees, hearing hisses in the dark. Some said they were drifters, people who’d gone feral living off the grid. Others thought they were something else, something the forest had changed. Nobody had proof, just stories that kept you up at night.I still work as a ranger, but I’m different now. I don’t go out alone after dark, and I keep my knife closer than I used to. Sometimes, on quiet patrols, I feel it—a prickle on my neck, like I’m being watched. I don’t look into the trees too long. I’m afraid of what I might see, and I’m afraid it might see me back.





**“Whispers Beyond the Tree Line”:**

I’ve been a park ranger in the Adirondacks for seven years, patrolling the endless trails, checking on remote cabins, and guiding hikers who get turned around. Most days are routine—birds singing, wind rustling through the pines, the crunch of gravel under my boots. But some things I’ve seen out here don’t sit right. They linger in your mind, make you question what’s hiding in these woods. It started a few years ago during an ice storm in Essex County, and the strange encounters just kept piling up, each one creepier than the last.It was during that ice storm, the kind that coats everything in a glassy sheen, that I first felt the unease. I was doing welfare checks on folks living deep in the park, people who don’t see neighbors for weeks. One stop was Mrs. Brown, an elderly woman who lived in a small, weathered house tucked in the shadow of Jay Range. Her place was a mile off the main road, down a narrow path lined with hemlocks. I pulled my truck up, the tires slipping on the ice, and grabbed my flashlight. The air was sharp, my breath fogging as I crunched toward her porch. Before I could knock, the door creaked open, and there she was, her face pale, her gray hair loose around her shoulders. Her eyes were wide, like she’d seen something she couldn’t explain.“You see those?” she said, her voice trembling, pointing to the ground just off the porch.I followed her gaze. There, pressed deep into the ice, were footprints. Human, but bare—no shoes, no socks, nothing. They were huge, bigger than any man’s I’d ever seen, the toes splayed wide, like whoever made them didn’t care about the cold or the sharp edges of the ice. My stomach knotted up. Who walks barefoot in an ice storm? And why here, at the edge of nowhere?“You didn’t hear anything last night?” I asked, crouching to get a better look. The prints were crisp, no smudging, like someone had stepped deliberately, pressing their weight into each one. They started near her woodpile and trailed toward the dark line of trees at the edge of her property.“Nothing,” she said, pulling her sweater tight. “I went to bed early. Woke up to get wood this morning and saw them. They weren’t there when I locked up last night, I swear.”I pulled out my phone and snapped photos, the faint glow of the screen lighting up the prints. They were unnaturally deep, like the person was heavy—really heavy—or had stood in place for a long time. I glanced at Mrs. Brown, her hands twisting together, and tried to keep my voice steady. “Stay inside, keep the doors locked. Call me if you see anything else, okay?”She nodded, her eyes flicking to the woods. “You think someone’s out there?”“I’ll check it out,” I said, forcing a smile. “Probably just a hiker who got lost. I’ll let you know.”I followed the tracks, my flashlight beam bouncing off the ice. They led straight to the tree line, then just… stopped. No more prints, no broken branches, no sign of anyone turning back or veering off. It was like whoever made them stepped into the woods and disappeared. I swept the light around, my heart thumping louder than I’d like to admit. The forest was silent, not even a bird calling. I went back to my truck, the hairs on my neck standing up, and drove to the ranger station.At the station, I showed the photos to Joe, a ranger with twenty years under his belt. He was at his desk, sipping coffee, his weathered face lit by the dim glow of a lamp. I slid my phone across to him. “Ever seen anything like this?”He squinted at the screen, his jaw tightening. The prints looked even stranger in the photos, too perfect, too deep. He leaned back, rubbing his chin. “Not exactly,” he said, his voice low. “But you hear things out here. Hikers talk about tracks that don’t add up—human, animal, doesn’t matter. Usually, it’s nothing. Kids pulling pranks, maybe.” He paused, his eyes meeting mine. “But those… those don’t look like a prank.”“What do you mean?” I pressed.He shrugged, but it wasn’t casual. “Just keep your eyes open. This park’s big. Lots of places for things to hide.”That wasn’t the end of it. A few months later, I was on patrol near Kibby Pond, a quiet spot surrounded by thick pines and marshy ground. I was checking trail markers when I spotted tracks again—not human this time, but animal. They looked like bear prints, but massive, each one twice the size of any bear I’d ever tracked. The claws dug deep into the mud, and the spacing was off, like the thing was moving slow, deliberate. They circled the pond, weaving through reeds, then stopped at the water’s edge. No splash marks, no prints leading out. Just gone.I called Joe on the radio, my voice steady but my pulse racing. “You ever see bear tracks this big? Near Kibby Pond?”Static crackled, then his voice came through. “Nope. Never. Could be someone messing around, carving fake tracks. But… I don’t know. Check the area, but don’t go alone if you can help it.”“I’m already here,” I said, scanning the trees. The air felt heavy, like the forest was holding its breath. I walked the pond’s edge, looking for anything—a snapped twig, a tuft of fur—but it was clean. Too clean. I couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes on me, like something was just out of sight, waiting. I left faster than I usually would, my hand resting on my radio the whole way back.Then there were the cabin break-ins near Allen Mountain. I got a call from a hiker renting one of the state cabins, a guy named Tom. He was waiting outside when I pulled up, his face pale, arms crossed tight. The cabin was small, wood-paneled, with a single door and windows locked tight. He led me inside, pointing to the mess. Chairs were tipped over, dishes stacked in odd patterns on the table—three plates in a triangle, forks balanced on top. Nothing was stolen, but the place felt wrong, like someone had been there just to leave a mark.“You sure you locked up before you left?” I asked, shining my flashlight under the table, checking corners.“Dead sure,” Tom said, his voice tight. “I was gone an hour, tops. Came back, and it was like this. I checked the door before I left—locked it myself.”I examined the door. No scratches, no pry marks. The windows were intact, latches still in place. But the air inside was heavy, carrying a faint smell, like damp earth after rain. “Anything else you noticed?” I asked.He hesitated, then said, “It felt like someone was watching me when I got back. Not close, but… out there.” He nodded toward the woods beyond the cabin.I searched outside, circling the cabin twice. No footprints, no tire tracks, nothing. But that smell lingered, faint but unmistakable. I told Tom to stay somewhere else for the night and reported it to the station. Joe wasn’t surprised. “Happened before,” he said over the phone. “Cabins get messed with sometimes. No one ever finds anything.”The next summer, things took a darker turn. I was patrolling near Wilcox Lake Wild Forest when a hiker flagged me down. She was young, maybe mid-twenties, named Emily, her face pale and her hands clutching her backpack straps. Her eyes kept darting to the trees, like she expected something to step out.“I got lost last night,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Set up my tent off the trail. I heard footsteps, heavy ones, circling me. I called out, asked who was there. No answer. Then I saw… something.”“What kind of something?” I asked, my notebook out, pen ready.“A shape,” she said, swallowing hard. “Tall, standing just outside the light of my fire. It didn’t move, just stood there, staring. I couldn’t see a face, just… it was there. I stayed awake all night, and at first light, I packed up and ran.”“Did it follow you?” I asked, my skin prickling.“I don’t know,” she said. “I kept hearing things—twigs snapping, leaves crunching—but I didn’t look back.”I walked her to the trailhead, my eyes scanning the woods. Nothing moved, no sounds but the usual forest hum. Her story stuck with me, though, because it wasn’t the first like it. Another ranger had told me about a hiker on Allen Mountain who saw a man with what he called a “thousand-yard stare.” The guy said the man watched him from the trees, silent, then crossed the trail and vanished. When the hiker reached the parking lot, his was the only car, and the trail register showed he was the last one out that day.I started digging through old reports after that, sitting late at the station with a stack of files. There were others—rangers noting strange tracks, cabins tampered with, hikers reporting figures that didn’t act right. One report from the ‘90s caught my eye: a locket found on a trail near Jay Range, small and silver, no engraving, no owner ever claimed. It was still in the evidence locker, and I pulled it out one night, turning it over in my hands. It felt heavier than it should, like it carried something I couldn’t see. I kept it in my desk, a reminder to stay alert.The final piece came when I ran into Ed, a ranger retiring after thirty years. He was cleaning out his locker, moving slow, like he wasn’t ready to leave. I told him about the footprints, the break-ins, Emily’s story, the locket. His face went still, his hands pausing on a stack of papers.“You’re starting to see it,” he said, his voice low. “This park… it’s got shadows that don’t line up. People come through, leave things behind—tracks, objects, looks that make your skin crawl. You’ll never catch them, never explain it. But it’s been happening as long as I’ve been here.”“What are they?” I asked, leaning forward.He shook his head, zipping up his bag. “Don’t know. Never will. Just watch your back. Always.”I still patrol the trails, check the cabins, help the hikers. But every step I take, I feel it—a weight in the air, like the woods are alive in a way they shouldn’t be. I check the ground for tracks, listen for sounds that don’t belong. Sometimes, when I’m alone, I hear footsteps, slow and heavy, just beyond the trees. I shine my flashlight, but there’s never anything there. Not yet. Whatever’s out there, it’s been here longer than me, and it’s not going anywhere.",1,1748154549.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Both experiences basically hard-reset my social circle. I've since picked up hobbies and met good people, but constantly hear others in tech (and beyond) struggling with the same things:

* Meeting new people without it feeling forced
* Establishing deeper friendships beyond surface-level interactions
* Finding people who share specific interests or availability

The universal problem: making genuine friends after college is brutal. Life changes fragment your social network and suddenly you're googling ""how to make friends as an adult"" at 2am.

I tried the existing solutions. Facebook Events harvests your data and feels corporate. Meetup groups skew formal or become networking events. Friend-dating apps create weird expectations. None solve the core issue: **we need casual, repeated interactions to build real friendships.**

**Introducing: Eventurely**

Digital recreation of those natural hangout spaces from college, designed for adult schedules and privacy needs.

**Core mechanics:**

* Create public or private casual gatherings (coffee, dog walks, board games)
* Discover nearby public events without location tracking
* Build relationships through repeated attendance, not forced interaction
* Private events require zero signup from attendees - just the organizer
* Spontaneous ""coffee anyone?"" posts for immediate plans

**Key differentiators:**

* Privacy-first architecture (join events without accounts)
* Optimized for recurring interactions, not one-off events
* Trust develops organically through actual meetup history
* No ratings, reviews, or gamification pressure

**Technical approach:**

* Starting with Flutter mobile app, web version following shortly
* Trust-based social graph learning from interaction patterns
* Location features without constant tracking
* End-to-end encryption with user-controlled keys

**Business model:** Freemium - public event creation and all attendance stays free. Small monthly fee unlocks private event creation and advanced group management.

I'm building this because I need it. COVID relocations showed me how inadequate current social coordination tools are for authentic friendship formation.

**Questions:**

* Does this match your adult friendship struggles?
* What would make you choose this over texting existing contacts?
* Any obvious challenges I'm missing?

Looking for honest feedback, especially from people who've wrestled with social coordination problems or built community-focused products. I'm open to collaborating on this :)",3,1748154299.0,AppIdeas,4,1.0,False

FFF/ff, Consensual, Slavery, Bondage, Humiliation. Part 2. Nora And Sarah ""Persuade"" Sheila And Layla To Accept Temporary Plastic Surgical Augmentation For Their Roles.","Nora's perspective

I sip my coffee and watch Sheila and Layla be prepped for their class by Alpha Slave Sarah and two of QOM's newest Alpha Slaves. They'd been runners up in a recent ""Shark Tank"" audition, where QOM's domme applicants demonstrate their talent by torturing and terrorizing two mummified slaves for a set amount of time while being evaluated. I giggled, of course I volunteered Zero and Border Bunny to be the slaves for their evaluation.

Jillian, a hot blond, and Elena a sort of attractive but plain brown haired girl, came in as a team, and did a good job staking out Border Bunny as their slave to focus on when they were let into the room where Border Bunny and Zero were mummified for the audition.

They got high marks for their initial desciveness and teamwork. Unfortunately, with in the limits prescribed, they couldn't get much of a fear reaction out of Layla, so their final score as effective dommes fell considerably. They scored just between those immediately accepted as trainee dommes and those told ""Sorry, you missed the cutoff, please apply again.""
Since potential was seen, they were offered a six month probationary period as Alpha Slaves, with the option to take the Shark Tank again at the end of the six months. They accepted, and were gleeful when Sarah selected them as Zero and Border Bunny's Alphas for the fellatio class.

They'd just finished installing the slave's electrobutt plugs, Jillian was eagerly kneeling in front of Zero, lingeringly attaching her clit leash, Elena doing the same to Border Bunny. The slaves stood stoically, feet shoulder width apart, enduring the indignity of having their girl buds bound and tethered with resolve.

Sarah stands in her black ASSHO 304 catsuit in front of and between the four, supervising while sipping from her cardboard specialty coffee cup. No sympathy for our two friends visible on her face today, just a nasty scowl she swings back and forth between the two of them, like they are two disgusting bugs found under a log. Both slaves stare straight ahead, not making eye contact, knowing it would make their Mini Korean drill instructor explode. All three of them knew how closely we are being watched today, so they put on Oscar performances.

""Alpha Slave Jillian! Alpha Slave Anna! Those clit leashes aren't going to get any tighter! I know these two imbeciles have nice twats, but you don't have time to play with them! Stand up and give me a thumbs up if your slaves are ready to present to Mistress Dao! She's got a class to teach!"" My former Navy sweetie was really channeling her inner Division Officer today!

The two Alphas hastily stand beside their slaves and give a thumbs up to their slave overseer, my honey, Miss Kim. Sarah nods, and pulls out her phone to text me, even though she knows we're watching her every move. Ari's big on protocol, so for this operation, so are we. All the way until we bring her down.

""I like your little Chosun girl. Normally I hate Korean bitches, so phony tough, but they...how you Americans say..snowflakes? But your Slave is ""the real deal"". I personally recommend she fasttracked to domme, she run four slaves like it a day at park."" The heavily accented Asian voice spoke next to my ear.

I turned to regard Mistress Dao, the slave's teacher for the day. She pulled off the sexy domme teacher look breathtakingly well. Her normal bun tied up in a beehive. Fake costume glasses perched on her pert nose. black blouse with gray tie. Short black skirt. fishnet stockings and black platform heels. A cruel punishment cane that could double as an Instructor's pointer. She was really motivated to teach this humiliating class to her captive audience.
I text Sarah to wait a moment, the slaves can be seated, she can let the Beta slaves relax their postures until Mistress Dao comes to class.

Sarah: I'm giving the Alpha's authority over the Beta's posture.

Mistress Nora: 😃 lol! Girl, you are so evil, I love it!

Sarah: Thank you, Mistress Nora.

Sarah turns to Jillian and Elena clutching the slave's clit leashes and trying to look self assured. ""Girls, Mistress Nora and Mistress Dao ask us to wait a few more minutes. We can sit while we wait. Do you want to let the Betas relax their posture while they sit? It's your decision, ladies.""

Jillian sounds off with a loud ""Fuck No!"" Elena giggles then says ""I agree, they don't deserve it."" Sarah nods ""Very well, ladies. Seat your slaves. When you're satisfied with their posture take your seats.""

Jillian rather roughly shoves Zero down into her high backed, uncomfortable seat, commanding the slave to sit at attention and harshly nit picking her posture. Elena more gently helps Border Bunny sit in an identical uncomfortable chair, but is still stern about her posture, even kicking in between her splayed feet to get a perfect 45 degree angle. Sarah just flops down in one of the extra comfortable rolling chairs she ordered just for this class for everyone else except the two students. She knew Layla and Sheila well enough to know the difference between seats was her unspoken way of emphasizing their inferiority.

When the Alphas were satisfied with their slave's postures, they tied off their clit leashes to u-bolts embedded in the floor underneath their chairs. Sarah gestured for them to grab a coffee from the cup holders on the desk. All three Alpha slaves circle their comfortable chairs and start casual small talk while sipping coffee, mostly ignoring the slaves. Sarah nods approvingly when one of them briefly glares over her shoulder at the Betas to let them know they're being watched.

""Well, Mistress Dao, you're looking at a Sorority girl, Officer Candidate School grad, and former Navy Officer. No suprise to me my Sarah is a leader."" I told her.

""Mmmm-I'm ready to start class, if you'll text your Sarah."" I dutifully sent it out.

Mistress Nora: Sarah, have your crew ready to stand and get their slaves up, Mistress Dao is on her way.

Sarah: Yes, Mistress.

Sarah informs Jillian and Elena, who scoot next to their slaves and undo their clit leashes, holding them loose but ready. The coffees are put aside, but the Alpha's still talk casually while glancing at the door. The Betas just stare straight ahead, backs straight, feet splayed at a 45 degree angle, waiting.

Dao strolls out of the security room with a clicking of  black  heels, cane clutched in her right hand. A few moments later the door to the classroom opens and Sarah leaps smoothly to her feet, shouting ""Slaves stand up!"" Jillian and Elena both jump up while viciously jerking their slave's clit leashes. Jillian is especially harsh, making Zero stumble, then whispering harshly ""Straighten up, stupid!"" while jerking on Sheila's clit leash so hard she struggles to do it.

Sarah reports smartly ""Good morning, Mistress Dao! Your students and their handlers are all present and accounted for, Mistress."" The sexy school teacher sweeps the slaves with a look of calculated disdain. The gimp hooded Betas with their mouths zippered shut are hard to read, eyes locked straight ahead. Jillian and Elena try not to look nervous under the scrutiny but ware failing. Sarah just seems cool and unafraid, a seasoned upper classman presenting her plebes. Though Dao is a few inches shorter, she seems menacing leaning in to the other Asian girl just by sheer prescence.

""Are you sure, Alpha Slave Kim, that all your slaves are accounted for and properly presented? I hear Mistress Nora is very meticulous, and punishes slaves severely for failure."" Her voice drips threat.

I am proud how my sweetie keeps her nerve. ""Mistress Dao, Alpha Slaves Jillian and Elena, as well as Beta Slaves Zero and Border Bunny, are all present and ready for your inspection."" Dao smiles fractionally. ""Very well, Alpha Slave Kim.""

She airily says ""Slaves be seated."" with a negligent wave of her petite hand. Sarah takes her seat smoothly. Jillian impatiently jerks Sheila's clit leash down so hard you can hear the brutal smack of her bare butt on the seat. The Alpha viciously says to her slave ""She said be seated, stupid!"" Even though it was obvious poor Sheila heard and is trying. Elena isn't quite as rough, but isn't exactly gentle as she yanks Layla down next to her by the clit leash. All five slaves remain seated at rigid attention.

""Slaves can relax their postures."" Dao casually grants. ""Not you, dummy!"" Jillian savagely yanks her slave's clit leash, even though Sheila made no move to relax her posture a millimeter. Elena just turns a vicious dominatrix glare into her slaves face, daring her to relax. Layla is too smart and well trained to do it, but the Alpha unwittingly adds to the performance.

Sarah explains, though I'm sure she knows Dao knows. ""I gave my Alphas leave to control their Beta's posture. They insist the slave's must maintain rigid postures at all times."" Dao cocks her beehive hair and bespectacled head thoughtfully. ""I see."" She gives a slight nod that seems to indicate approval.

""I'd like to welcome my students, Slaves Zero and Border Bunny to my Fellatio class."" Two quick jerks of slave's clit leashes got mmmphed ""Ank ooo, Iswess Aoa!"" in unison.

Now her smile is fully predatory and evil. ""You're most welcome slaves. When I found out you two were taking this course, I no want to miss the opportunity.
My rules are simple, pay attention, be engaged, participate, and behave. If you fail to do any of these things, I'll punish your Alpha slaves, not you."" Another wicked smile, she didn't need to say that then they'd  punish the Betas. Severely. The domme glares the Alphas are giving the Betas is a reminder if they need one.

""Now let's begin."" I turn from the lesson to two tablets I had in front of me. The timeline is going fast now that we are hopefully in the final stage. What I was looking at was part of the endgame that we didn't have time to brief the slaves on.
It was a temporary body mod, but still obscene and cruel. On break, the cameras were going to go down, and we'd get Dao and the two Alpha slaves out of the room.

I felt a harsh pang of guilt. We were going to give  the slaves a fair chance to consent. There was a 50/50 chance they would. But they would ""consent"" before the end of break, one way or the other. I looked at the two suffocation hoods and posture collars that we'd use if we needed the ""other""  option in getting the slaves to consent.

Fuck, I despise these gray areas! But dammit, they knew what they signed on for and had plenty of time to back out. Now that window was closed, and they would have to trust us and do what they're told, like we discussed. If they didn't they'd be punished. I tried to stay impassive, but my sadistic glee was rising, only kept in check by my feelings of loyalty and friendship.

Sarah's perspective

The class is a suprisingly boring excuse to bully the poor slaves. Boring to me, I guess. Fun for Dao and the two Alphas. Miserable for poor Sheila and Layla. Poor ladies, this day isn't going to get any better for them. These next few weeks aren't. I hope we take down Ari soon. Though if Nora and I have to use our persuasion plan on them today, our friendships may already be shot. They may not be able to forgive what we have to do to them for the objective. To be fair, in their place I'd struggle with understanding it, too, despite volunteering.

Stay focused in the present, Sarah. Jillian hangs small weights from Sheila's nipple piercings to ""help her focus"". Not that heavy but the strain causes gradual pain over time. Elena clamped Layla's nipples and chained them to u-bolts on the desk, giving the same excuse of helping focus. The Alphas smack their slaves upside the head, flick nipples and kick clit leashes to ""focus"" their slaves. Dao continues teaching with a faint, smug grin of pleasure. I really wish we could just kick the bitch's ass. Not yet, Sarah. But thinking about it keeps me going.

Finally, Dao shuts up and makes a big show of looking at an expensive watch. ""Break time, for dommes and Alpha slaves. I no think lazy Betas deserve break.""

Text from Nora right on time. ""Mistress Dao, Mistress Nora would like to have a private discussion with the slaves, just the four of us. We'll watch them, hydrate them and take them for bathroom breaks as needed."" Dao nods.

""Sound good, Alpha Sarah. Alpha Jillian and Elena, secure slaves to their chairs before leaving. You can go to the Alpha Slave lounge and the nearest lady's room unescorted. Be back in half hour."" They dutifully reply ""Yes, Mistress Dao."" and start restraining their slaves as she leaves.

Supple, adjustable leather straps pinning them to the chairs above and below their bare breasts. Ankle cuffs of the same material securing their legs to the legs of their chairs. I'd been sitting behind them, but I walk around in front to inspect the Alpha's work. 

Once the slaves are secured, I grant the Alphas leave to go on their break. I look at my two friends still struggling to maintain their postures, sweat pouring off their exposed skin. ""Relax, girls, no tricks, deep or shallow breaths."" I walk between them, putting my left hand on Layla's shoulder and my right on Sheila's. ""You're doing good, girls. Just take a load off, as much as you can.""

They slump against what minimal slack there is in their bonds, breathing ragged and exhausted. I squeeze their shoulders as reassuringly as I can. ""Mistress Nora is bringing water and some wet cloths to hydrate and cool you girls. We got some last minute stuff to discuss, girls. But for the moment, relax as much as you can, I know you can't get really comfortable.""

Just in time Nora comes in wheeling a supply cart. The slaves immediately snap erect and greet ""ooo affaonoon, ishwess ora!"" Nora waves a hand magnanimously and winks. ""Relax girls, enjoy your break."" I note with approval the suffocation hoods and posture collars are hidden. No need to alarm the slaves when we may not need to use them. Nora motions me to step behind the slaves and holds up her phone. In the notes are typed ""Cameras down, couldn't make an excuse to sweep this room for bugs. be careful."" I nodded. This was QOM territory, sweeping for bugs, or trying to sneak a ""maintenance crew"" in to do it, can look suspicious.

Nora goes back to the supply cart and pulls two bottled water out of an iced cooler. She hands one to me. I gotta up to Layla, unzip her mouth and unpack it, then gently hydrate her. Nora does the same thing for Sheila.

After that, we each pick a bowl of water and a wash cloth from the cart to give the slaves a quick sponge bath. It gets steamy, especially when Nora and I seem to linger at the slaves' breasts at the same time. The slaves' nipples harden and they start breathing heavily. So nice if we could make steamy girl love, just the four of us, and forget everything else.

Duty calls. After the wipedown, we repack and zip shut their mouths, Nora pushes the cart behind the slaves so they can't see us uncover the suffocation hoods and posture collars. I quickly grab one, slap it around Layla's neck, and lace it up before she can react. She gives a cute grunting of inquiry. I just pet her hooded head and say, ""Shh, relax sweetie."" Nora goes through a similar process with Sheila.

Once their heads are locked forward, Nora hands me two tablets from the cart. Each has an AI picture of Sheila and Layla with obscenely huge botox lips. Sensing the slaves' nervousness at what is going on, I step in  front of them and hold the tablet with the applicable AI Avatar up to each face. Long moment of silence from them.

""Girls, we said no surgery and we meant it. This is just a program of Botox injections that are temporary and easily reversible. We really didn't want to do this to either of you, but Ari insisted we alter both of you in some way like every other Slavegagger girl. We picked Botox lip injections because they're impermanent and reversible. When filming is over you girls will have your lovely kissers back in no time. Now we just need a quick consent for now.""

Of course, they have to start squeaking and mmmphing angrily. I sigh and let the tablets drop to my side. ""Come on, girls just this one thing. It will be injections at Ari's mansion, but it will be supervised by doctors and nurses handpicked by Dave. Just a little more cooperation, please?"" More mmmphing and squeaking. I guess I couldn't blame them. Being turned into a big lipped blowup doll wouldn't be fun, no matter how temporary and reversible it was.

Nora has a nasty gleam in her eyes. She stands behind the slaves, holds out her open hands, and double slaps the back of their heads. ""Silence, slaves."" She doesn't yell, her voice is even, which I know is when my Nora gets really scary, the slaves know it as well as I do.

She holds out her hands for the tablets and I hand them to her. After she puts them back on the cart, she grabs the suffocation hoods and tosses one to me.
I unfurl it so the slaves can see clearly what it is. ""Last chance girls, just consent to this one little thing..."" I am relieved at their obviously eager affirming mmmphs and squeals.

""No."" Nora intones with a voice of doom. ""Too late. You're both getting a taste of the suffocation hood. Then you're both getting lip enlargement injections at Ari's. No if's, ands, or buts."" I plead ""Mistress Nora, please, they were just a little startled....that's all...""

Nora glares me silent. This is happening. Let's get this over with. I step up behind Layla as Nora does the same to Sheila. They are  squealing, mmphing and wiggling now, but they can't even move their heads, nothing they can do. On Nora's signal I pull it over Layla's head and pull it closed around her neck to seal it. Layla panickly tries to breath air through the latex hood while squirming. She is fighting hard, but is so bound up she is easy to control.

Nora is  doing the same to a squirming, suffocating Sheila. I fight tears and try to make sure no air could slip through where I held it around her neck.

I look at Nora pleadingly as they both start to wheeze and rattle. She nods and we remove their hoods. They gulp air and started mmmphing at us. Nora slaps Sheila across the face with the flaccid hood, then Layla. ""Shut up, Slaves."" She sounds mad, but then I see her brushing tears with her left hand. The slaves dutifully shut up.

""Now, is that a yes, girls?"" I ask quietly. Two eager if breathless ""Ess, apa ara!"" reply to my inquiry. I pat both their heads at the same time. ""Good girls.""

Nora swiftly undoes their posture collars and plunks them on the cart. Then she puts the tablets with their ""augmented"" pictures in front of each girl. ""Bow your fucking heads! Hang them low, bitches, you should be ashamed!"" She shoves the back of their heads even though they are already trying to bow them as low as possible. 

She puts her hands on her hips, glaring back and forth between the humbled slaves. ""You two might be getting shipped to Ari's tonight!! Any problem with that, sluts?"" Two mmphed ""Oh, iswess Nora."" from the hang dog slaves. ""Better not be."" Then she storms out, I know her well enough to know she'll be bawling when she's out of sight.

I stare at the two humbled slaves, staring helplessly at their future botox lipped selves. No matter how temporary it is, forcing this on them seems like a violation. They radiate misery and defeat with their heads hung as Mistress Nora's ordered penance, staring at what's to be done to their pretty faces. They'll suffer this indignity silently, while atoning for their crime of daring to defy their Chief Disciplinarian. I think of trying to comfort them, but feel so sad and hollow it would seem empty to all three of us right now.

I settle for patting both their backs, then pulling up one of the comfortable chairs to sit between them and scroll my phone quietly. I don't see the screen, just Dao and Ari tied up with their heads hung like my friends are right now. I know we may not have time for that, protecting the helpless, including these two brave young women, has to be our focus. But if we can carve out some time for revenge...for the moment picturing Ari and Dao in my friend's places is the only thing keeping me sane. We'll beat her, and maybe give her a taste of the other end.

So yesterday i had a mishap became so stressed hadi nikalia. I was to move to a new place which i had dropped the deposit first but in some way another person paid for next house or my house idk and locked. I get there and there's a Mindy padlock on my house door, on asking the caretaker he says he'd sort it out asap. I call the house owner who confirms i paid for the house first and the padlock isn't supposed to be there. I already had my movers hapo nje(which a friend of mine had paid for yaani the only positive thing yesterday) 

The padlock owner confirms he'd be around the place tomorrow afternoon which is today now (I'm still waiting) So I'm there na mtoto and movers and no place to put my stuff. Nikaanza kulia coz sasa hizi ni gani tena. Mind you, i had called the caretaker before moving na akasema i proceed as planned. After calling my mom, i call my boyfriend he's in this happy bubble,i didn't want to dampen his mood at that time so i told him all was trying to be good I'd update him. I later around 7:30pm dropped a text to him telling him how I'm stressed and a refugee in another house as I await they break the padlock today. I didn't and haven't gotten a reply yet and sorry for putting it this way, ain't expecting a reply i think partly because he views me as competition (story for my next diary tale) That's him, sometimes he doesn't care and funny I'm this toxic that i won't talk about it with him ever. 

Here i am with things everywhere, uniform to iron na sijui Iko kwa box gani, a corporate outfit to search for sijui Iko side gani, a fresh mind to pull tomorrow which i don't think i have yet. I don't know how many affirmations I'll do and need for tomorrow 😀. I'm still begging this sweet idiot friend of mine nimnunulie coffee coz truth be told and not judging ye hucome through nikiwa kwa ditch sana. I'm still waiting for things to be okay today I've done enough crying for the month already. 😆 I'm just a girl i don't have enough energy to endure mashida kadhaa kadhaa",12,1748153690.0,Kenya,4,0.94,False
