Compared to other larger power stations, it's compact and lightweight, easily held in one hand. Besides charging small electronic devices like phones, laptops, and LED lights, it also works great to power some high-wattage appliances and we can enjoy our ""luxury"" camping: making coffee, toasting bread in a toaster, making potato pancakes in an air fryer, and even running a 12v refrigerator.

1oty8p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheInternetsJury/comments/1oty8p7/tifu_by_trying_to_help_my_coworker_with_her_period/,TIFU by trying to “help” my coworker with her period,"
So I (20M) just started my first internship a few weeks ago. It’s my first real job, and I’ve been trying super hard to make a good impression. The other intern on my team, Sarah (20F), is really smart, confident, and honestly kind of intimidating — she knows her stuff.
Anyway, here’s where things went wrong.

Every month, “period week” was basically a sacred event in our house.

When it happened, the women of the family were off duty. Full stop. They didn’t cook, they didn’t clean, they didn’t go to school — they rested. My dad and I would take over everything.

We’d make the meals, do all the dishes, deep clean the house (my dad claimed if help with the Hormones), and deliver food straight to my mom and sisters’ beds like they were convalescing queens. My dad said it was important because “they’re losing a lot of blood, too much movement and they could pass out.”

He also swore that chocolate had medicinal properties for periods. Like, actual medicine. 
“Helps balance the hormones,” he’d say, handing me a Chocolate bar like it was Tylenol.

So yeah — I grew up sincerely believing that when a woman’s on her period, it’s a near-death experience that requires bed rest, male assistance, and cocoa-based medicine.

Sarah and I were in a team meeting, talking about our shared project, when she mentioned in passing that she got her period that morning. I, with all the confidence of a man who has no idea what he’s talking about, went full caretaker mode.

I said,“Oh no, you should take it easy today. I can handle your parts of the project.”

And then — God help me — I reached into my desk drawer, pulled out a chocolate bar I keep for snacks, and said, “Here, this’ll help with the hormones.”

The look on her face. She just stared at me for a solid five seconds before going, “Excuse me?”
And I, completely oblivious, continued, “Yeah, my mom and sisters always say it helps when their bodies are pushing out all that blood. Don’t worry, I’ll take over today so you don’t pass out or anything.”

The room went silent. Our supervisor literally choked on her coffee. Another intern started laughing so hard he had to excuse himself.
Sarah looked genuinely offended (rightfully so) and said, “You do know women can still function normally when they’re on their period, right?”

I froze. That was the exact moment I realized I’d somehow turned into the office Victorian doctor.

Later, my supervisor pulled me aside for a quick “chat.” She was trying so hard to be professional about it, but I could tell she was seconds away from laughing. She said, very carefully, “So… I heard about the chocolate situation.”

I immediately started apologizing, saying I didn’t mean to offend anyone, I just thought that was something you were supposed to do.
She nodded and said, “I appreciate the thoughtfulness, but… just to clarify, periods aren’t really something that stop women from working. They don’t actually, um, bleed out.”

I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole. I muttered something about “the hormones and the blood loss,” and she just sighed and said, “Okay. I think we’re working with some… unique family health education here.” She ended up emailing me a five-minute educational video titled “Understanding the Menstrual Cycle” with the subject line “For your professional development.”

Now the office calls me Dr. Hershey, people keep leaving chocolate bars on my desk labeled “for hormone emergencies,” and Sarah hasn’t looked me in the eye since.

1oty676,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1oty676/rude_ssv_and_green_bean/,rude ssv and green bean,"hi guys! 

so i made a post here a couple days ago and got embarrassed because i thought i was overthinking things, do i deleted it. but things have continued to get worse over the last few shifts ive had with this particular ssv.

i’ve only been at starbucks for two weeks today. i had one week of training and was sent off on my own. There’s still a lot of things i’m working on getting down and finding my rhythm, and the other partners at my store tell me i’m doing great and this job has a HUGE learning curve. 

But, i’ve run into an issue with an ssv. she’s really really mean to me, and only me. she constantly tells me i need to hurry up, nitpicks every single thing i do.. even things i know how to do, and her attitude towards me is just really really negative. i’m the only person at my location she doesn’t like. 

she shoved the coffee timer at me and said “brew, now.” and when i was on DTO (for the first time ever) she kept barking that i needed to be taking orders before i could even open my mouth to greet the customer. she was annoyed with me today when i was doing DTO because i still am not super in the flow with it yet (juggling both screens, the window, and handing out food and drinks) im still adjusting, and when i asked her for help she was like “just do it properly.” and kinda raised her voice at me not to close the window. 

my SM told me not to take things personally and coaching is just part of the job, but it feels super personal and directed.. i’ve been told by other ssvs that i’m doing great and killing it but i don’t know how to feel anymore. i feel like i want to give up just so i don’t have to work with her anymore. I don’t really care that she doesn’t like me, but she’s really unprofessional and her criticism isn’t constructive in the least, she doesn’t point me in the right direction ever, she just belittles me. 

anyway, any advice would be appreciated. i am also autistic so i don’t know if that plays a part in me just being overly sensitive or what and making a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be, but ive never been treated like this by someone who’s supposed to help me learn. thanks! 



TLDR: ssv not providing constructive criticism, just nitpicking and singling me out since i’ve worked with her. she acts very warm and kind to literally everybody else and acts super friendly to everyone but immediately shifts her attitude when i come around. any advice appreciated.

1oty12t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oty12t/i_think_i_might_marry_my_friends_husband/,I think I might marry my friend's husband.,"I’ve never been married and it's been a while since I've been in a relationship. A few years ago, I stepped out of the dating pool. One of my closest friends, on the other hand, has been married for nearly 15 years.

She and I were college roommates. She met her husband during those years, and they married not long after graduation. Shortly after their wedding, she was diagnosed with a progressive illness. Since then, much of their marriage has centered around him being one of her primary caregivers.

We hang out a few times a month. Some days, she’s the same vibrant, exuberant woman I met in college. Other days, I’m not sure how much she’s truly taking in. More and more, she drifts off to sleep in her wheelchair while her husband and I continue talking about everything and nothing.

He’s an impressive person. A successful professional, a world traveler, a marathon runner, a skilled woodworker, and above all, a deeply devoted husband. People often call him a saint for the way he’s stood by her, caring for her with unwavering patience and commitment.

Despite his demanding job, his hobbies, the ever-growing complexity of my friend's care, he still remembers things about me. My favorite music, the cross-country trip I’ve been planning, how I take my coffee, the new bakery I mentioned in passing. After my own recent surgery, he offered to visit and showed up with one of my favorite treats, unprompted.

We don’t know how much time my friend has left. But lately, I’ve had this persistent feeling that someday, when she’s gone and when he’s ready, he might want to explore something more with me. If I'm ever going to be married, it's going to be to him. Nobody else has seemed ""right"".

Sometimes that thought makes me feel awful, like I’m betraying my friend. I'm the other woman who's stealing someone else’s husband. Other times, it feels like a natural evolution of a bond that’s already deepening in a quiet way. I deserve someone wonderful, and he is just that.

I don’t have a crystal ball. I don’t know what the future holds. But I do know that this isn't ideal and life is rarely as simple or as clean-cut as we wish it were.",1,1762829096.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

No fancy dev background here—I've been working away for about a month now, fueled by coffee and late-night Satoshi memes.

I've tested 'em out myself, but y'all are the real experts—holders, miners, noobs, and OGs alike. Hit me with your thoughts, roast 'em if they suck, or suggest epic upgrades. Let's make Bitcoin even more awesome together!Quick intros to each (links included if you wanna poke around— they're super basic right now, built with some simple tools, but hey, gotta start somewhere):

1. [Satoshi Ball](http://satoshiball-blttcixx.manus.space)
   * Basically a magic 8-ball but powered by the spirit of Satoshi. Ask it Bitcoin questions like ""Should I buy the dip?"" or ""Is this altcoin a scam?"" and it spits out cryptic, fun answers. Think oracle for your HODL decisions!
   * Why I'm hyped: It's lighthearted, could help newbies get a chuckle while learning, and who doesn't love a bit of mysticism in crypto?
   * Status: Prototype's live, but needs more polish and maybe AI smarts.
2. [Crypto Weather](http://cryptoweath-76bf8scd.manus.space)
   * A ""weather forecast"" for the Bitcoin market—sunny skies for bull runs, thunderstorms for dumps, with quick stats on price, sentiment, and news. Like checking the weather app before heading out, but for your portfolio.
   * Why I'm hyped: Makes market volatility feel less scary and more predictable, especially for folks who check charts obsessively (guilty as charged).
   * Status: Half-baked, got the basics working but wanna add real-time data feeds.
3. [Panic Button](http://cryptobtn-kkgkropo.manus.space)
   * Ever freak out during a flash crash? This is a big red button you ""press"" to get instant calming tips, meme distractions, or even quick sell alerts (but mostly to remind you to breathe and HODL). No actual trading, just anti-panic vibes.
   * Why I'm hyped: We've all been there—paper hands moments suck. This could save some sanity in the community.
   * Status: Early days, functional but could use community-suggested features like custom alerts.

So, what do ya think? Satoshi Ball for the fun factor? Crypto Weather for practical daily use? Panic Button to keep us all from rage-quitting? Or scrap 'em all and pivot to something else? I'm all ears—pros, cons, ""this reminds me of X app,"" tech tips (I'm using basic web stuff, open to suggestions), or even if you'd actually use one.

It's a huge phrase that can feel a little intimidating, right? Like you have to climb a mountain every single day. But honestly, most of the time it's not about massive leaps. It's about small, smart adjustments—the little **life optimization hacks** that stack up over time.

For me, it boils down to a few simple ideas that keep me moving forward.

**The ""One Thing"" Brain Hack** 🧠

We're constantly told to multitask, but it’s a myth. Our brains are built for focus. When I feel overwhelmed, I just ask: ""What's the *one thing* that, if I do it now, will make everything else easier?"" Sometimes it's answering that one dreaded email. Sometimes it's just tidying my desk. Focusing on that single task until it's done is like a reset button for my productivity.

**The ""Proof of Awesome"" Happiness Hack** ✨

Our brains are hardwired to notice what's wrong. To fight this, I started keeping a ""Proof of Awesome"" list. Every night, I write down *one* thing that went well. It could be big or small—crushing a workout, having a great conversation, or just making a really good cup of coffee. It forces you to hunt for the good and trains your brain to see that life is, in fact, pretty awesome.

Speaking of the emotional side of things, it’s not always easy to manage on your own. Sometimes feeling happier and less overwhelmed requires a bit more structure than just a daily list. If you're looking for something to help you map out your emotional well-being, I've had a good experience with **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**. It helped me get my thoughts in order when I felt stuck.

**The ""Tiny Momentum"" Rocket Fuel Hack** 🚀

A rocket doesn't get to space in one giant burst; it's a continuous, powerful burn. That's how I think about my goals now. Instead of ""I'm going to get fit,"" it's ""I'm going to do a 10-minute walk today.""

*   Want to read more? Read *one* page.
*   Want to start a project? Open a blank document and write a title.

These tiny actions feel almost too small to matter, but they build momentum. They are the small wins that fuel the bigger ones.

She was a WWII history teacher for 40 years, so we're taking her on a bucketlist trip to Normandy. I'm really overwhelmed by research and options and can't believe I don't have something booked for our travel.

I was thinking Amboise for Loire? That being said, if someone has an incredible chauteau they've stayed at, I think that would be a real treat for her.

In Loire, looking for ideally: Small village that has a place to grab pastries and coffee and/or where we can walk to a cozy place for dinner. Does not have to be fancy. Again, Amboise keeps popping up as the best base.

For Champagne, I originally looked at Reims, but because of the WW1 damage and size of the city, I don't think it has the ""charming"" quality I have my hopes set on, but happy to be proven wrong. Hautvillers keeps popping up in my searches, but again, I've left too little time for research.

1otxvwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1otxvwx/best_base_3_nights_loire_valley/,Best Base 3 Nights Loire Valley,"Hello! Traveling next week to Loire Valley and champagne region with my husband and Mother-In-Law, we'll have a car and coming from 3 nights in Bayeux. She was a WWII history teacher for 40 years, so we're taking her on a bucketlist trip to Normandy. I'm really overwhelmed by research and options and can't believe I don't have something booked for our travel. After the 3 nights in Bayeux, we landed on 3 nights in Loire Valley, 2 nights in Champagne and then back to CDG. 

My husband and I love food and wine, we don't like super touristy places and live in a city, so we like to stay in quieter areas. My MIL is just happy to spend time with us :). While we'd normally stay in an AirBnB that might be somewhat remote, but because it's the 3 of us, I think staying somewhere that's walking distance to something may be the best. I was thinking Amboise for Loire? That being said, if someone has an incredible chauteau they've stayed at, I think that would be a real treat for her. 

  
In Loire, looking for ideally: Small village that has a place to grab pastries and coffee and/or where we can walk to a cozy place for dinner. Does not have to be fancy. Again, Amboise keeps popping up as the best base.

  
For Champagne, I originally looked at Reims, but because of the WW1 damage and size of the city, I don't think it has the ""charming"" quality I have my hopes set on, but happy to be proven wrong. Hautvillers keeps popping up in my searches, but again, I've left too little time for research. I'd love a recommendation for either a vineyard stay or nice boutique hotel option in a small city/town. We love AirBnBs, but with only 2 nights at the end of our trip, a hotel might be nice!

1otxvgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FrontAmount/comments/1otxvgz/my_wifes_oura_ring_survived_a_week_in_a_coffee/,My wife’s Oura ring survived a week in a coffee pot… and a full percolator boil 😳☕💍,"Thought my wife’s Oura was gone forever — turns out it spent a week inside her coffee pot… and somehow lived through a full boil.

My wife realized her Oura ring was missing. We checked the Oura app — last known location: our house… about five hours earlier.

We downloaded Wunderfind (that Bluetooth device finder app) and scanned everywhere — the house, both cars, the driveway. Then we literally drove a mile down and a mile back along our road — the same one she’d walked that morning — creeping along the berm hoping for a Bluetooth ping. Nothing.

Next stops: the seamstress and sub shop she’d gone to that day. Still nothing. Finally, the gas station — where her gas cap tether had broken — we searched the entire parking lot. I even went inside to ask about lost and found. Zero luck.

We eventually gave up and left town for a week.

When we came back, she made coffee like normal in her old-school percolator — filled it with water, coffee basket on top, boiled for five minutes, poured her cup.

After she finished, she went to wash the pot, dumped the leftover coffee into the sink and — CLANG.

It was the ring.

We figured out that before she’d started her day, she’d cleaned the percolator and while putting the metal parts back in, the ring must’ve slipped off into the pot. Any sound it made would’ve blended in with the rest of the clanging metal.

So it sat inside that percolator for a full week — and then survived a rolling boil of coffee.

The wild part? There was still enough battery left that it synced with the app that morning when she found it. We recharged it — and a week later it’s still working like new.

For something meant to track sleep, surviving percolator coffee is next-level durability.
Oura, if you’re reading this — you’ve built a little tank disguised as a ring. ☕💍

⸻

TL;DR: My wife lost her Oura ring. A week later, she found it at the bottom of her coffee percolator — after it had been boiled. Still works perfectly.

## The Gift Guide: Xmas Gifts for Her, Sorted by Vibe

We’ve broken down these killer gift ideas by personality type. Just find her category below and let the inspiration flow.

### ### For the Cozy Homebody

She believes the best nights are spent in, with a good book, a soft blanket, and zero pants. Her sanctuary is her home, so let's elevate it.

*   **Weighted Blanket:** More than just a blanket, it's like a constant, gentle hug. Perfect for someone who loves to de-stress and snuggle up on the couch. Look for one with a washable, removable cover.
*   **Luxury Candle Subscription:** Instead of one candle, give her a new scent to discover every month. Brands like [Scentbird](https://www.example.com/scentbird) or [Vellabox](https://www.example.com/vellabox) offer incredible, curated experiences.
*   **Silk Pillowcase & Eye Mask Set:** A touch of everyday luxury. It's better for her skin and hair, and it feels incredibly opulent. This is one of those ""I would never buy this for myself, but I adore it"" gifts.
*   **Smart Mug:** For the coffee or tea lover whose drink is always going cold. An Ember mug² keeps her beverage at the exact temperature she wants for hours. It's a game-chancer for her work-from-home routine.
*   **High-Quality Loungewear Set:** Think beyond cheap pajamas. Invest in a beautifully made set from a brand like Lunya or Eberjey. It’s a gift of comfort that she’ll feel amazing wearing.

### ### For the Tech-Savvy Trendsetter

She's the first to know about the latest gadget, and her life runs on smart tech. These gifts are for the woman who loves innovation.

*   **Portable Photo Printer:** A device like the Canon Ivy Cliq or HP Sprocket lets her print photos straight from her phone. It's perfect for creating tangible memories in an instant.
*   **Smart Jewelry:** A piece of tech that's also beautiful. Consider the Ringly smart ring or a bellabeat Leaf health tracker. It subtly notifies her of calls and texts while tracking her wellness.
*   **Wireless Charging Valet:** A sleek, all-in-one station that charges her phone, watch, and earbuds without a mess of cables. It keeps her nightstand tidy and her tech ready to go.
*   **Aerial Drone:** For the adventurous spirit! A beginner-friendly drone like the DJI Mini series opens up a whole new world of photography and fun.
*   **Voice Assistant with a Smart Screen:** An Amazon Echo Show or Google Nest Hub is more than a speaker. She can use it for video calls, following recipes, watching videos, and controlling her smart home devices with her voice.

### ### For the Creative Soul

Her hands are always busy making something beautiful. From painting to pottery, she expresses herself through her craft.

*   **MasterClass Subscription:** Give her access to online classes taught by world-renowned experts in their fields. She can learn cooking from Gordon Ramsay, writing from Margaret Atwood, or filmmaking from Martin Scorsese.
*   **High-End Art Supplies:** If she's a painter, get her a set of professional-grade paints or brushes from a brand like Winsor & Newton. If she sketches, a beautiful leather-bound sketchbook and a set of fine-tip pens will be treasured.
*   **DIY Pottery Kit:** Let her get her hands dirty with an at-home pottery kit. It comes with everything she needs to create her own small pieces, from the clay to the sculpting tools and paint.
*   **A Modern Calligraphy Set:** This elegant hobby is both relaxing and productive. Look for a complete kit that includes a variety of nibs, a pen holder, ink, and practice pads.
*   **A ""Creative Retreat"" Day:** The best gift isn't always a thing. Plan a day for her to be alone and create. Book a hotel room for a night, pack her supplies, and let her have uninterrupted time to work on her passion project.

### ### For the Wellness Guru

Her self-care routine is non-negotiable. She's all about mindfulness, movement, and treating her body like a temple.

*   **Theragun Mini:** The holy grail of muscle recovery. This pocket-sized percussive therapy device is perfect for working out knots after a workout or a long day at her desk.
*   **Acupressure Mat:** It looks like a bed of nails, but it's an incredible tool for relieving tension, improving circulation, and encouraging deep relaxation.
*   **Hydrogen Water Bottle:** For the friend who has everything. This trendy tech-infuses water with molecular hydrogen, which some studies suggest has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
*   **A High-Quality Yoga Mat:** If her current mat is slipping and sliding, upgrade it to a luxurious, non-slip, eco-friendly option from a brand like Liforme or Manduka.
*   **Sunrise Simulation Alarm Clock:** A gentler way to wake up. This clock gradually brightens to simulate a natural sunrise, which can help regulate her sleep-wake cycle and make mornings less jarring.

### ### For the One Who Deserves a Little Luxury

She works hard, and she deserves to be spoiled. These gifts feel opulent, special, and utterly indulgent.

*   **Designer Wallet or Cardholder:** A small but significant luxury. A beautiful leather piece from a brand like Kate Spade, Tory Burch, or even a classic Gucci or Prada adds a touch of class to her daily life.
*   **Personalized Jewelry:** Go beyond a simple necklace. Consider a custom birthstone ring, a bracelet engraved with a meaningful date or coordinates, or a locket with tiny photos inside. Brands like Mejuri and Catbird are fantastic for this.
*   **A Classic Fragrance:** A signature scent is the ultimate luxury gift. Go to a high-end department store and get her a classic from Chanel, Dior, or Byredo. For a more personal touch, find a local perfumery that offers scent profiling.
*   **Cashmere Sweater:** The epitome of cozy, timeless luxury. A well-made cashmere sweater in a neutral color like camel, grey, or black is a wardrobe staple she'll have for years.
*   **Wine or Whiskey Tasting Experience:** An experiential gift is often more memorable than a physical object. Book a private tasting for two at a local vineyard or high-end whiskey bar.

## Still Stuck? Think About These Pro Tips

If you've scrolled through this list and still feel unsure, take a breath. The best gift doesn't have to be the most expensive.

1.  **Become a Detective:** Pay attention in the weeks leading up to Christmas. What does she complain about? (""My headphones always die!"") What does she admire? (""Oh, that's a beautiful bag!""). These are your biggest clues.
2.  **Focus on Experiences:** Research shows that experiences often bring more lasting happiness than material possessions. Concert tickets, a cooking class, a weekend getaway, or even a fancy dinner out can be the most cherished gift of all.
3.  **When in Doubt, Personalize It:** A personal touch transforms a good gift into a great one. A simple photo book of your memories together, a framed print of a special place, or an item engraved with her initials shows thoughtfulness that no store-bought item can replicate.

Happy hunting! Finding the right Xmas gifts for her is all about showing her how well you know her. You've got this.",1,1762828656.0,JollyDecorAndGifts,0,1.0,False

1otxv2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1otxv2h/im_30m_lost_2_years_with_my_wife_42f_and_we_are/,I’m (30M) lost.. 2 years with my wife (42F) and we are separating..,"So, long story..

I fell head over heels in love with a woman. She reminded me so much of my first love and had a wonderful charming sweet personality. She made me feel loved and cared for.. she even said once “youve been neglected, havent you?” And brought me to tears..

We immediately fell in love. I was so happy to have her.. we shared with each other our disabilities and we vowed to always work around abd help each other with our disabilities.

Then a few more weeks in- I told her that I was VERY sensitive, and cry very easily.. and that I will never be a rich man probably, but I am full of love and a loyal to a fault.. she told me that she had anger issues, and some mental health issues. We agreed to work around those as well. 

Anyways, a few months In- I start to notice slight verbal abuse, but nothing crazy. Mostly just pointing out that I do dumb stuff or making a snarky comment about it. I am book smart, but I lack common sense, and can be very absent minded. I don’t do it on purpose- it’s just me. But I notice the small things I accidentally do- seem to trigger her and make her act different… anyways- I acknowledge no one is perfect, and deal with that no problem. I have a good ability to laugh stuff off, or can find humor in the silly situations my absent mindedness gets me in..

In October she started wanted a new car for some reason. She did have a car, but she decided she wanted a new one. We went to. Couple dealerships- and I even tried to sign with her, but we couldn’t get approved immediately without a down payment and that upset her a lot… one day she goes down with her sister to a dealership for her sister to get a new car.. and then on the way home she starts texting me that she’s really sad and wants to commit suicide.. I beg her not to… I tell her it’ll be okay. I tell her that she can always use my car as much as she ever needs, that it’s just as much hers as it is mine… she responds, “no it’s not. If it was mine, I’d have traded it in already.” Then she texts me “I was going to drive off the cliff but I had to miss the turn so my sister didn’t get lost” because they were following each other… I get very upset because my girlfriend wants to commit suicide.. I end up just offering for her to trade in the car, but I couldn’t afford the payments so she would probably have to get rid of her other car… she gets happy and agrees.. after we get the new car (which my mother actually helps us sign for so we get a good rate) she says “your happy ***** is back,” 

Few weeks later I propose to her at the place of our first date. She accepts.. I feel so happy. I feeel like I’ve secured the love I lost with my first love..

Few weeks go by- she starts texting her most recent bf a lot. Constant texting, good morning texts, pet names.. all that. I had made it very clear that I’m monogamous.. I’ve been cheated on a whole lot in the past… I told her I didn’t like it at all, but she said it was nothing and she loved me.. she asks to go out for a girls night twice that month. We share location- so I do notice where she is.. 

Fast forward past her marriage, and getting a house with my mother and my family, she is having an outing with a group of friends that include this “most recent ex” and she ends up at that address she went to twice for “girls night”. And out of curiosity I ask her where she is. She said “exs house, I did not know they wanted to meet up her..” later I confront her about the addresses and she denies it and calls me crazy.. then a few months later she starts asking to go hang out along with this ex at his house. That is way too much for me. I’m not comfortable with that. I tried to set a boundary.. she told me I was controlling, insecure, and did not trust her, and that she wanted to divorce me… so I gave up and just let her go… (3 times total in the relationship).. I just didn’t see the reason for her to go over there for “coffee” or to have dinner.. he’s an ex for fucks sake, treat him like one..

At this point the word divorce is almost daily in her vocabulary and I cry almost every day because of it.. we come to a point where she starts to anger towards my family. Sends a passive aggressive group text message to the entire family saying no one helped us “clean”… she sent it as my mom was pulling in with groceries.. after she was done working her 2nd job that she had been pulling to try to keep up with all the new bills.. mom comes in, the room, and says “it seems like your upset, …” before she can finish. My wife starts saying I a very loud voice “hell yeah I’m upset”.. my mom replies, “are you yelling at me?” And she replies (in a yelling voice) “THIS IS ME YELLING”… mom walks out, and we end up in a text message war.. and while mom does try to make things work, it ends up not working and she moves out, about a month or two after the incident..

We move out into our own apartment… the abuse that has turned physical at this point is increasing. At this point I’ve been choked, slapped, pushed, kicked, punched, headbutted, target practice, all sorts of things.. I still fight to stay with her, even though she threatens me with divorce and breaks me down every day…

Well without support from my mom, and my wife quitting her job because she was sick of it- my usual income of Lyft driving and my disability check was no longer enough.. I started working another job at a call center on top of this.. 

I am 8 months into my job. She’s just started working again because we were struggling even with me lyfting, working a 40hr week, and a disability check, it wasn’t enough. 

Anyways 2 Fridays ago- we had a blow up. She went to the doctor, and the doctor did tell her that the stress she’s under could cause a flare up. She got mad at me about this. She said that my bad providing and my mom’s fight has caused her so much stress that I’m causing her to be miserable, and need to be hospitalized. Then she tells me I also don’t do nearly enough housework to keep things manageable for her… every single day I came home after working 2 jobs, and cooked dinner, took out trash, did more laundry, dealt with my sons homework, bath, put him to bed.. I literally never stop. I don’t play video games anymore. I haven’t played cards with friends in years. No more jam sessions. I put all my effort into this relationship and our life… and she tells me I don’t do enough.. 

Now know I still have never called her a bitch, or anything like that, I have tried to never do anything except call her “mean.” But I lost it. I started yelling. We were on face time. I said “I don’t want this anymore, it’s not fair. I’m sorry that I make you so miserable. If I make you this miserable, I’ll stay OUT of your life” I hung up, thee my phone in the backseat. I was over it then. I wanted to be done… she had finally pushed me there. I had been taunted with divorce for so long, and fought against it, and now I was the one that wanted it. I went back inside from my lunch break and told my employer what was going on.. they gave me the rest of the day off.

The next week actually goes half smoothly.. I mean she still did threaten to leave me, but there weren’t any HUGE fights.. until this past Friday again. I woke up early to go make a little bit of money that we needed to finish paying this month’s rent. I woke up super early. I noticed the dog peed in the floor. I started. Leaning it after getting ready. I told my wife. She said “wow, she wouldn’t have if you would have walked her like you were supposed too.” I ignore it and keep cleaning, but she gets up- in a bad mood, and says “I’ll clean it, you don’t do it right.” .. so I just step aside and respect her. She’s giving me commands and things to do while she cleans it, and I said “ok” in the most plain neutral way I could’ve said it and I hear “Oh, so we’ve got an attitude now? Asshole.” And I know that the day is goo to be crap… she’s in an awful mood. I kiss her bye and go to work. She seemed to have calmed down a bit- but not even 1 or 2 miles down the road I get a text “I’m unhappy” “I want a divorce..”.. I start crying and type back …… . She said “boy, bye. Don’t come home.”.. she says something like so I need to leave or will you? And I said I’ll come pack my stuff… I go home and start packing. She says “all this because you just had to be an asshole.” And I was a smartass and said “all this because your dog peed in the floor.” She comes storming down the hall and shoved me into the kitchen sink. I fall back but catch myself on the corner. I start screaming “Ah” and trying to get past her. She bear hugs me and starts hushing me… I squirm freee and go towards the door and just pace and freak out for a few. I get really anxious when she gets physical towards me…. She eventually calms me down and convinces me to stay. While we are sitting there talking, she begins to sob and say she wants to take all her pills and kill herself. I cry too and tell her it’s terrible and I hope she never does that. We talk, and while she’s still sad, she tables the suicidal talk, and I put the pills up. I have to go to my actual job now- in which I e taken so much time off for her mental health, that I don’t have any remaining “missed time” and even being late gets me fired. So I cannot stick around to keep cheering her up, and I know she has to work very soon anyways. So I kiss her bye and head to work. When I’m at work, she starts saying that I left her to die. She says “what kind of husbands leaves their wives the way I felt”. I keep telling her “if you want me to quit and come home, I will, but if I leave I will lose my job. Is that okay?” And she wouldn’t answer it. I’m not making your decisions… all day fighting and her making me feel bad, and I quit my job for her. Which makes me feel AWFUL. They were so good to me, and it felt good to have that extra money, AND I felt accomplished. But I did it for her… and she still wasn’t grateful. She just kept hanging the fact that I didn’t go it before work or on my lunch break. She says since it took since my last break, that it really didn’t matter..

Anyways fast forward two more days to today. She made me stay home from Lyft when I woke up super early. I was having a good time chatting with her cause she was awake and seemed to be I.  Good mood! So I stood and talked a few minutes.. and she was like GO OR STAY stop TEASING me, then got up and said guess I’m going to, even though I don’t fucking want too. So I told her just to get back in bed and we weren’t going and I stayed.. 

She starts working. Doesn’t feel good. I call and make her a doctors appointment. It’s time to leave. I put my jacket on. She asks me “is my jacket OUT THERE?” I glance around the living room? Didn’t see it.. glanced around the dining room, didn’t see it, and she freaks out “what’s taking you so long?!?, obviously it’s not there and it’s in the closet dumbass.” “This is why I don’t want to be with you. This is why I want divorce.”… then in the car on the way to the doctor she starts in on the “you left me alone while I wanted to kill myzelf” “you left me to die”… and I just start bawling again. She’s yelling T me, which one of us is packing and leaving? And I said me, and I packed, and I called my mom which I’m so surprised she came to help after the way things turned out, and left…

I’m sitting here now, and can’t help but think of the good times, the butterflies, the laughs, the adventures, the sweet way she used to say my name, her sweet voice, her beautiful warm eyes.. and it takes all I have to hold myself together. Why after all this, why do I still miss her so bad, and want to hear her say something sweet to me? Why do I want to hear her tell me that she loves me? Why am I dying inside because I’m not checking on her? 

I’m so lost.. I’m so sad… I’ve been beaten down and abused, and I’m still longing for her…. Is it worth fighting for? Do abusers ever change?.. or do I just be sad and forget? 

Any guidance anyone?

1otxu52,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockbusterTVSeries/comments/1otxu52/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_does_it_really/,MITOLYN Review'S and ComplaintS:~ Does It Really Work or Just Another Scam in 2025?,"For years, I’d been searching for something—anything—that could give me real, lasting energy without the inevitable crash. I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in



I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline",1,1762828560.0,BlockbusterTVSeries,1,1.0,False

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline",1,1762828508.0,BlockbusterTVSeries,1,1.0,False
1otxsul,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1otxsul/my_sibo_wasnt_actually_sibo_it_was_my_thyroid_the/,My SIBO wasn't actually SIBO - it was my thyroid the whole time (and 15 naturopaths missed it),"If you're reading this at 3am googling ""why does rifaximin only work for 5 days"" or ""SIBO keeps coming back,"" I need you to hear something that took me over a decade and $12,000 to figure out.

Your SIBO might not be the problem. It might be the symptom.

I've been where you are. The endless rounds of rifaximin that work like magic until day 5 post-treatment when everything crashes back. The herbals (oregano oil, berberine, allicin) that give you hope for two weeks before the bloating returns with a vengeance. The restrictive diets that make you feel like a social pariah while barely moving the needle on your symptoms.

My health journey started at 28 when I developed alopecia totalis, complete hair loss, eyebrows and all, practically overnight. That crisis sent me down the functional medicine rabbit hole. Since then, I've seen 15+ naturopaths (only 2-3 were actually helpful), multiple gastroenterologists, various functional medicine doctors, nutritionists, acupuncturists, and ""gut health coaches.""

I tried every protocol this subreddit mentions. Things like elemental diet (done it twice). Low FODMAP became my personality. I have spreadsheets tracking my reactions to 200+ foods. I spent $800 on SIBO breath tests alone, watching my hydrogen levels bounce between 45 and 80 ppm no matter what I did.

The most frustrating part was for years, my thyroid labs were ""normal."" TSH bounced between 2.0-2.5, free T4 right in the middle of the range. Every doctor looked at those numbers and moved on to prescribe another round of gut-focused treatment. Meanwhile, I had Hashimoto's antibodies through the roof, but they kept saying my thyroid function was ""fine.""

Here's where things got interesting for me:

Last year, during perimenopause hormone testing, I specifically sought out an endocrinologist who specialized in women's hormones and thyroid conversion issues, something I learned about from digging through PubMed at 2am. She noticed something odd. My TSH had dropped to 1.2 (still ""normal""), but I had all the hypothyroid symptoms. Brain fog so thick I couldn't remember my coworkers' names, hair falling out in clumps (again), feeling hungover every morning without drinking, needing 3 cups of coffee just to form sentences. My partner would want to do things and I'd be too exhausted to even consider leaving the couch.

She ran a full thyroid panel including free T3, reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies. My free T3 was at the absolute bottom of the range. The pattern suggested central hypothyroidism with a T4 to T3 conversion problem. Basically, my body was making thyroid hormone but couldn't convert it to the active form my cells actually use.

She suggested I run my existing 23andMe raw data through a health interpretation service to check for conversion issues. Sure enough, I have the DIO2 variant that impairs T4 to T3 conversion, particularly in the brain and muscles. My Hashimoto's wasn't just attacking my thyroid. It was part of a bigger pattern where my body literally couldn't use the thyroid hormone it was making.

Why does this matter for SIBO - I hear you asking.

Thyroid hormone directly controls the migrating motor complex (MMC), those cleaning waves that sweep bacteria out of your small intestine. It also controls stomach acid production, digestive enzyme release, intestinal motility, and bile flow.

When your thyroid isn't functioning properly, your entire digestive system slows down. Food sits longer, bacteria have more time to ferment, and the normal cleaning mechanisms fail. You develop SIBO not because you have ""bad"" bacteria, but because your system can't maintain proper bacterial geography.

The KEY here is Standard thyroid treatment (levothyroxine/Synthroid) only provides T4, which my body couldn't convert. I needed T3 support specifically.

Started on compounded slow-release T3. It took three dose adjustments over two months to find my sweet spot (started at 2.5mcg, now at 5mcg twice daily). Added selenium, zinc, and tyrosine to support conversion. Within 3 weeks, my morning ""hangover"" feeling was gone. I was actually having bowel movements without coffee. Bloating reduced by maybe 50%. Brain fog starting to lift. I had energy to actually do things with my partner again.

The bloating took longer, probably 6-8 weeks to really improve. Still have bad days, especially around my cycle. At week 8, I retested for SIBO. Hydrogen was 12 ppm. First negative result since my thirties. Had to retest it because I didn't believe it.

The restrictive diets I'd been following were actually making my thyroid worse. Carbohydrates are essential for T4 to T3 conversion. Every time I went low-carb or did another elimination diet, I was sabotaging my thyroid function and perpetuating the cycle.

The autoimmune protocol that was supposed to heal my gut? It tanked my already struggling thyroid. My body needs those carbs, especially during perimenopause when hormone fluctuations already stress the thyroid.

I'm not saying everyone with SIBO has a thyroid issue. But if you're stuck in the treatment-relapse cycle, consider looking upstream:

**Get comprehensive thyroid testing:**

* TSH, free T4, free T3, reverse T3
* Thyroid antibodies (TPO, thyroglobulin) - especially if you have Hashimoto's
* First morning basal body temperature (under 97.8°F suggests low thyroid)
* Consider genetic testing for thyroid conversion variants

**Check related markers:**

* Ferritin (low iron impairs thyroid function)
* Vitamin D
* B12 and folate
* Selenium and zinc

**Question the connections:**

* Did your SIBO start during a stressful period?
* Do you have other hormone issues (PCOS, perimenopause, low testosterone)?
* Is your body temperature always cold?
* Do you have a family history of thyroid issues or autoimmune conditions?

After all these years of treating the bacteria as the enemy, I finally understood they were just opportunists in a slowed system. Fix the system, and the bacteria sort themselves out.

I still take digestive enzymes and a prokinetic (ginger/artichoke), but I'm eating normally again. Real pasta. Actual bread. Vegetables that aren't just ""low FODMAP approved."" My last three breath tests have been negative.

We get so focused on killing bacteria that we miss the bigger picture. Your gut doesn't exist in isolation. If you've tried everything and nothing sticks, maybe it's time to look beyond the small intestine.

After all this, I wanted people to know that the solution might be hiding in those ""normal"" lab ranges that aren't normal for you.",28,1762828457.0,SIBO,8,0.95,False

However, I have a hard time connecting with people in this area in general— I’m in the arts (do photography work full time) and also own my own business (which is also a photography business). For a lot of years since I moved out here, I struggled with altitude and health issues, I have overcome them and prefer having balance in my life, so I don’t drink and just enjoying hiking, making my art taking landscapes and getting coffee / working on my business. I also have an interest in filmmaking and have gone to multiple film group meetups and made some actor / actress acquaintance in those towns down the mountain. However, I find me choosing balance over drinking makes me not fit in at all, which I don’t mind still going to bars (I still do) but you’re obviously not seen on the same playing field when you’re not participating. I also recently bought a bible and have been kinda called to Christianity, I think it’s fascinating and gives quite a perspective on life. 

Anyways, all that said, I can’t help but go to bed every night these days and just think I’ll be alone forever. There’s no actual options of romance in the town I’m in, and the ones down the hill I will ever rarely see. But I care deeply about my work and art, so I find it difficult to leave my job and this area I’m in just because I want to get a girlfriend. I also hate dating apps and they just seem like window shopping — I’m alright on looks, had girls who wanted to date me when I was in school and university, but nothing special enough to really pull from a dating app. I also don’t feel a connection from texting and prefer meeting in person. 

Today I was debating if I was wasting my life living in this small town, but it’s hard for me to weigh my business successes with relationship success. I wish I could see my future self and just know the answer if I’d regret these years of my life or not. If I’m 35 and still single, I might have a great business life and make lots of money. However might I then be incredibly upset that I don’t have a wife? I do get upset when I think about that now, so I wonder if that would carry over. On the flip side, I can also see a future where if I was super successful I would be able to then find a wife. ",1,1762828454.0,Life,1,1.0,False

# first things first, let's line up the facts / info we have:

☑️ Jillian and Riley were in a relationship up until at least end of August 2024 (*romantic trip to italy in April 2024 where her post still shows up in his tagged posts, but his profile doesn‘t show up as tagged on her profile anymore. Both were tagged in a post and were posing in pics together from the same trip / wedding on August 24, 2024*)

☑️ Jillian met Vinnie in **October 2024**, but they were ‚*just friends back then*‘, however Jillian allegedly mentioned on a live stream that Vinnie *'tried to make a move on her'* back then already

☑️ Jillian mentioned on her **letterboxd** review on **June 22, 2025** that she‘s *'missing her soulmate'* who at that time was *'traveling on the other side of the world'*

☑️ Jillian also mentioned in the same review that she has a *'special connection with someone'* she met 11 years ago, had *'instances of crossing paths in between'*, AND *'finally reconnected'* with in 2024. And she ended the review with *‚if u are reading this i miss u come home </3‘*

☑️ **on June 22, 2025**, Vinne was in Toronto for a Valorant event and spent quite some time with Sabrina Olaso

(🖇️ check here for more info [https://www.reddit.com/r/jillianbrennasnark/comments/1oq735c/jillian\_no\_one\_wants\_your\_man\_you\_had\_him\_because/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jillianbrennasnark/comments/1oq735c/jillian_no_one_wants_your_man_you_had_him_because/), 🖇️ link to the Tiktok Sabrina posted back then on her second account [https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdKrWCGH/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdKrWCGH/))

☑️ Jillian then mentioned on **June 30, 2025** in a seperate **letterboxd** review that she‘s using her *‚bf‘s netflix‘* who was gone for two weeks and then complained about her *'f\*cking up'* his algorithm.

☑️ It looks like around **June 30, 2025**, Vinnie also came back from his Toronto / Paris trip

☑️ On multiple occasions Jillian claimed Vinnie and her got closer in July

☑️ **Vinnie** made his **own letterboxd** account on **July 23, 2025**, wrote two half assed reviews, did **not** like any of Jillians reviews, did **not** follow Jillians account, **followed some dude named Frank**, logged off and was **never active on the platform again**

☑️ Vinnies stream that confirmed their relationship was on **September 17, 2025**, claiming their one month anniversary would be the next day, making the official **start of their relationship August 18**

☑️ Around the time of Vinnies September 17 stream, Jillian got called out for her obsessive letterboxd reviews, and she was quick to **delete and alter** certain parts:  
she deleted ~~the entire soulmate and backstory part~~ on her **June 22** review, including the ~~‚i miss u’~~ at the end, and on her **June 30** review, she changed ~~‚i use my bf‘s netflix‘~~ to *‚i used someone else‘s netflix‘* and the ~~‚he said‘~~ to *‚they said‘*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# So what was up with these letterboxd reviews?

**After gathering all these contradicting infos and breaking them down, there's two main possibilities...**

1️⃣ either the letterboxd reviews in June were 100% about Vinnie 

2️⃣ or there was a third person, a guy that was NOT Riley but that she was obsessed with and actually met 11 years ago, and maybe all these reviews in June weren‘t about Vinnie at all

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Let's explore these possibilities, compare them to the facts that we have, and do a little deep dive...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1️⃣ **POSSIBILITY 1**: ""the letterboxd reviews in June were about Vinnie and Vinnie only""

✅ **what would speak FOR this:** 

💭 *the theory of her being completely delusional:*

* they could’ve hooked up much earlier than July with no strings attached, and Jillian could’ve fantasized about Vinnie being her ‚bf‘ and ‚soulmate‘ as early as June, while they weren’t exclusive yet and Vinnie was still getting involved with Sabrina
* she could’ve made up an entire red string theory / backstory with Vinnie that wasn’t real
* she could've exaggerated on the *‚other side of the world‘* part or even meant his following Paris visit
* Vinnie returned from his Toronto / Paris trip around June 30 so it would line up with the *‚he came back from traveling for two weeks‘* in her review from that day
* the *‚if u are reading this i miss u come home </3‘* part and calling him her *‚bf’* and *'soulmate'* look especially creepy in this context because if they weren't an official thing back then, I highly doubt she would have wanted for him to genuinely read these things, she must have written them more for herself
* so when she got called out for those obsessive sounding reviews, she deleted those exact parts because they were about Vinnie, and Vinnie wasn't supposed to know, and she was scared he would see and notice how obsessed and weird she was ~~(But Vinnie made a letterboxd account on July 23, so if she was in panic about what he might think, wouldn't she have altered these reviews much earlier?)~~

💭 *the theory of some actual conspiracy happening that BOTH of them are in on:*

* they both could have been hooking up and mutually calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend since June, and she could‘ve actually posted the review for Vinnie to see (~~despite the fact that he only got his own account in July and didn‘t interact with her account or reviews at all~~)
* if that’s the case, there must be some big and good reason for them both to hold back the info about an acutal past with each other 11 years ago and in between (~~but then why would she write about it on a public platform in the first place only to delete it after?~~)

❌ **what would CONTRADICT this:** 

💬 *the fact that people have doubted their connection and relationship in terms of hurriedness and authenticity since the beginning*

* if they truly had any prior connection, let alone 11 years ago, and had crossed paths in between, they would‘ve said so. It would have made them look more established, more organic / meaningful and authentic. They made it no secret they were friends since October 2024, why would they not admit to an even longer history?

💬 *the fact that Jillians repeated pattern is to make things sound bigger and more meaningful als they are*

* If there was more substance behind their relationship, she wouldn‘t suddenly hold that info back

💬 *the fact that Vinnie was in Toronto*

* Vinnie wasn‘t on the ‚other side of the world‘ on June 22, and you‘d think while being a hopelessly romantic and dramatic person, Jill would have enough knowledge about geography since she‘s been outside of america and even to europe a few times 😭

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2️⃣ **POSSIBILITY 2:** ""the letterboxd review was about a third person / love interest""

✅ **what would speak FOR this:** 

💭 *the theory that Riley might have already been out of the picture since August / September ish 2024?*

* so there was possibly a bit of a gap before she met Vinnie and could've gotten involved with somebody else

💬 *the fact that Vinnie and her never confirmed meeting 11 years ago or in any way earlier than October 2024*

💭 *the theory that it could've been some type of long friendship turned friends with benefits / situationship that had no official relationship label but made her feel a limerence and sense of destiny similar to what she's now expressing with Vinnie*

* if it was a situationship, the 'bf' on her letterboxd review on June 30 could also mean 'best friend'? would fit with the '11 years ago' 'soulmate' narrative
* the *'finally reconnecting'* in 2024 could be about them if they came back into her life between the break up with Riley and the first encounter with Vinnie
* the entire *'red string theory'* part would make sense then
* that would mean she was still with that person in June, using their Netflix, not Vinnies
* according to that theory she would've literally been involved with Vinnie AND said person at the same time to some degree and there WOULD have been some kind of overlap

💬 *the fact that despite already meeting in October, Vinnie and her were 'just friends' until July*

* if Vinnie 'tried to make a move on her in October' like Jillian allegedly claimed once, why would she have hesitated?
* either she was still too involved with that other person and actually felt some loyalty
* OR that claim is false / she was trying to make things seem bigger as they were once again and Vinnie DID NOT show actual romantic interest in her back then, so she stayed in that other 'situationship' for a while

💬 *the fact that Vinnie was spending an alarming amount of time with Sabrina Olaso in Toronto while Jillian wrote her 'I miss u come home </3' note*

* the entire situation on Vinnies end would make more sense and would have been more acceptable if Jillian had someone else at that time, too

💬 *the fact that Vinnie made his own letterboxd account but did not care about Jillians reviews or her profile at all*

💬 *the fact that Jillian deleted and altered those exact parts in her letterboxd reviews right after being called out in public, NOT right after Vinnie made an account of his own*

* maybe they were never about Vinnie or written for him to read, and she only changed them because she didn‘t want more of his fans to come to that false conclusion
* or maybe she didn‘t want his audience to find out there was somebody else she was obsessed with right before she got with Vinnie, because it would've only made her look even worse

❌ **what would CONTRADICT this:** 

💬 *the fact that there's no sign of a third love interest ever existing on her social media*

* was there never any evidence because it was a very one sided thing and the other person didn't want to make it public? Or did she delete all the evidence before she got involved with Vinnie?

💬 *the fact that she's very opportunistic and Vinnie most probably has much more followers and opportunities to offer than any third person in her environment*

* it doesn't really make sense that she would turn Vinnie down to stay in a situationship if Vinnie actually made a move on her as early as October 2024
* if that's the case, she must have really felt a deep obsession with that third person
* but if she met that other person 11 years ago and believed in the red string theory with them, that might have made her want to hold on to it for a while

💬 *the fact that the person was allegedly traveling the 'other side of the world' for two weeks*

* if the third person was also traveling at the same time as Vinnie was in Toronto / Paris, it would admittedly be a huge coincidence

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# 🚩After exploring both possibilities, I don‘t know what‘s more of a red flag. 🚩

1️⃣ **saying all that about Vinnie and romantically addressing him without him actually reading or acknowledging it** (he had no account back then and didn't even like the review later on when he made one) **- and either blatantly lying and being delusional about a mutual backstory or the backstory being true, but both of them are for some reason trying to sweep it under the rug now**

OR

2️⃣ **Having a third person besides Riley and Vinnie to call her soulmate and tie the red string theory to and use their Netflix in June, then getting closer to Vinnie while still being involved with them, only to then toss it all overboard in the span of a month because Vinnie, the person with more following and opportunities, was suddenly ready to commit to her**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Or maybe the truth is somewhere in between?

3️⃣ **POSSIBILITY 3:** ""her daydreaming about and mentioning two different connections in the same letterboxd review.""

# oh look, the flag got even redder 🚩🚩🚩🚩

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# what do you think? 🤔

has your brain melted, yet? 🤕

**Education:** BSc from BUET, MSc from the US. Currently pursuing a PhD

**Age Range in Prospect:** 26-30

**Location & Relocation:** In the US

**Nationality:** Bangladeshi

**Marital Status:** Never married

**Ideal Marriage Timeline:** within 1-1.5 years, though I’m open to flexibility depending on compatibility and shared readiness. 

**About me:** 

I am a researcher with a reflective heart, someone who values calmness over chaos, depth over surface. My typical days revolve around studying, writing, cooking, and staying active, but I also take time to notice small, beautiful moments like evening light, the warmth of good food, late-night driving through the streets, and meaningful conversation. I’ve learned from struggle, and I carry that with humility. I’m drawn to someone genuine, curious, and grounded, someone who believes connection is built slowly, through shared laughter, patience, and care.

**Five important characteristics about me:** 

* Emotionally warm and grounded: someone who can hold space for both silence and conversation, who doesn’t rush to fix but listens to understand.
* Genuine and empathetic: kind not just in words, but in small, consistent actions that show care.
* Intellectually curious: someone who loves to think deeply, explore ideas, and have conversations that go beyond the surface.
* Communicative and steady: values honesty and emotional transparency, yet knows when to be gentle and patient.
* Values growth and connection: sees love as a journey of mutual evolution, not perfection; someone who’s willing to grow together through both joy and struggle.

**Level of religiosity:** 

I practice Hinduism with a spiritual, reflective approach. My faith in God has been a quiet source of strength, and I’m deeply grateful for the kindness life has shown me. Growing up in the diverse, cultured neighborhoods of Dhaka taught me to value respect and openness toward all faiths and ways of life.

**Level of education and preference:** 

I am drawn to someone educated, with at least a bachelor’s degree, who is intellectually curious, witty, and thoughtful enough to hold conversations that flow with both depth and warmth. 

**Current job status:** 

PhD candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at a leading research university in the southern United States.

**Do you want kids:** 

Yes, hopefully someday. I sometimes dream of a future where my first child is a daughter, a thought that always fills me with quiet warmth.

**Hobbies and Interests:** 

I enjoy reading, writing, and cooking; they help me slow down and stay grounded. I’m passionate about fitness and long walks that clear the mind. I love meaningful conversations, exploring psychology and spirituality, and finding calm in simple things, such as a cup of coffee, good music, or watching the sunset after a long day.

**Something interesting about me:** 

I’m the kind of person who gets equally excited about a deep research idea and a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. I can lose track of time discussing psychology, philosophy, or why Dhaka feels so nostalgic. I’m a bit of a nerd, in a good way, of course; thoughtful, curious, and always up for a conversation that starts serious and ends in laughter.

**What I am looking for in a partner:** 

I’m drawn to someone kind, emotionally intelligent, and grounded, someone who values depth, warmth, and honest communication. I admire a woman who’s educated, curious, and passionate about her own path, yet finds joy in life’s quieter moments. Above all, I’m looking for a connection built on mutual respect, patience, and growth, where both inspire each other to become better and more whole.

**Preferred mode of contact:** 

Feel free to message me here on Reddit. I would be glad to connect and take the conversation from there. Thanks for reading!",2,1762828034.0,BangladeshMarriage,0,1.0,False

1otxn6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1otxn6n/minimal_effort_maximum_return_heres_what_actually/,Minimal effort. Maximum return. Here's what actually works,"I'm tired of complicated optimization advice. Here are the simple changes that genuinely transformed my life with almost zero effort:

Walk everywhere (seriously, design your life around this)

Move close to work, groceries, gym whatever matters to you. Walking is the most underrated life hack. Free therapy. Free exercise. Free thinking time. No traffic stress. No parking anxiety. Just automatic daily movement and mental clarity. This one change fixed my health, my mood, and my bank account.

Earplugs ($2 investment that changed everything)

Best money I've ever spent. Deep sleep even with noise. Focus in chaos. Peace on planes, trains, coffee shops. Your environment is constantly stealing your attention and rest. Two dollars solves it. Keep a pair everywhere nightstand, bag, desk.

Notifications off. All of them. Always.

This is non-negotiable. Every notification is someone else's priority interrupting yours. Your phone should be a tool you use, not a leash that controls you. Turn off every badge, banner, and buzz. Check things when YOU decide, not when an app demands it. This alone will reclaim hours of focus.

Remove negative associations with yourself

Stop calling yourself lazy, stupid, undisciplined, or any other label that reinforces failure. Your brain believes what you repeatedly tell it. Every time you say ""I'm bad at this"" you're training yourself to be bad at it. Rewrite the narrative. You're not lazy, you're learning better systems. You're not stupid, you're building new skills. Words shape identity.

Pocket notebook (just trust me on this)

Carry a small notebook everywhere. Not for journaling or perfect notes. For capturing thoughts before they disappear. Ideas. Tasks. Random observations. Things you need to remember. Getting it out of your head and onto paper frees up mental RAM. Phones don't work for this too many distractions. Paper is instant and focused.

Why these work:

They're all one-time decisions with permanent benefits. You don't need daily willpower or motivation. Set it once, gain forever. No apps to maintain. No habits to track. Just structural changes that automatically improve your life.

Most self-improvement advice is exhausting. ""Wake up at 5 AM! Meditate! Journal! Track macros! Cold showers!"" These things work sure. But they require constant effort.

These five things only need minimal ongoing effort. Maximum return. Just tiny adjustments that quietly compound into a completely different quality of life.

I tried doing it solo but it feels strange. Looking for people to have on the pod that have lived and had some funny/sad crazy stories they want to tell.
I will be recording this on an iPhone with wireless mics(audio only starting out) and will be recording in  different locations such as coffee shops etc
This is my opening promo.

Hi I’m a  former drunk. A full-time f*ck-up turned part-time truth-teller.

I’ve lied. I’ve cheated. I’ve laughed in the faces of people who loved me — then cried alone when they finally left.

I burned bridges like it was a sport, then acted shocked when I had nowhere left to go.

I don’t have a redemption arc. I’m not here to preach or pretend I’ve healed.

I’m just here to talk about the mess — the blackout nights, the broken hearts, and the brutal lessons I earned the hard way.

I’m Jay. And this is The Best of My Worst. Take a seat. It’s gonna get uncomfortable.

Let me know if you like the promo or if you feel you would be a good guest on the pod.

That's the problem if we're too much stereotyping a perpetrator and categorizing whole nationality, then justice won't be served, and those innocent behaving people from that nationality will feel unfair and distanced from tending with the public.
If the perpetrator is a Malaysian or Singaporean, of course netizens will expose her and made her remorse about consequence of her misbehaviour. If we stop stereotyping and really put effort to understand her identity and what led her to this, actually 99.9% people from that nationality who are behaving and friendly all the time, will feel grateful and stand with us.
Let make a peaceful world and let those misdemeanors feel shameful about their aggressive behaviour. Also we should also practice forgiveness and give chance for her rehab of her anger management issue before she return to us as part of society.",0,1762827802.0,Bolehland,7,0.25,False

I recently took the XPT train from Sydney to Melbourne and was pleasantly surprised to find vegan options available on board.

I honestly did not expect there to be any, so I had packed a few snacks just in case.

For breakfast, they offered a coconut curry pie ($7), and for lunch, a Thai green curry with rice ($13.50). The pie was good, lunch was ..Edible.

There were other snacks as well: cut fruit and carrot, celery, hummus boxes. Didn't get those. 

The crew were lovely and very helpful.

Idk what do to anymore. I have horrible social anxiety when I’m out alone. I can barely go into fcking walmart to get a fee things. It’s gotten so damn bad, and im really scared. I’ve never dated, am im not sure I’m ever going to be able too anymore. I can’t even look strangers in the eyes. 

Literally yesterday, i went to Walmart to get just green tea, coffee, trail mix, and jello-chocolate pudding mix for my sister, since my parents for got to get it. I sat there in my car in the parking lot, trying to be convinced that i’m okay, people or are just people and everyone is too busy focused on themselves to really give a damn about focusing on me. I felt alright up until i got to the doors, because past that threshold theres obviously a ton of people, and my mind immediately started wanting to run away, bad. I’ve been trying to work on both trying to ignore the feeling, or just trying to sit with it and go about my business with it lingering and present. So like usual i just go in, trying to be a normal person. It eventually gets so overwhelming, very quickly. I felt myself going stiff, and getting warm and physically irritated all over, and my eyes trying to water. I kinda semi-hid in an empty isle for a bit, trying to distract myself with whatever, and try and take some good breaths to try and steady damn nerves. I thought i brought my mental to a decent enough state to try again, but as soon as I left the isle, it came back. I did this a few times, and just pushed myself throughout the whole process. I tried repeatedly pulling my phone out, trying to make a visual excuse as to not to look so weird. Its very stupid, I definitely understand that. I didn’t know what else to do to keep any tear or anything from happening. The phone is right there and accessible, so i went for it, a lot. Its really weird because it felt like at some point its like that part of my psyche gave out or something, and all that instense anxiety kinda lifted for a brief moment, and i got kinda mentally numb to the surrounding stimuli and people. I was able to look up and in front of me where people were, and it felt SO fucking awesome. Ive never had that happen before. But then it came back down on me when going to check out. I just avoided looking at people at all. Its like if i try to focus on anything outside of whatever’s directly right in front of me, the anxiety increases a ton. 

I hate it, and i fucking hate that i can’t handle everyday normal shit like talking to people, or even something as simple as eye contact. It’s gotten so bad, and me trying to expose myself more to the scary stress, doesn’t seem to help much. 

Ive never really talked to anyone about it. Its this deep deep shame i have. Ive only vaguely mentioned to my friends that i have a bit of social anxiety, but thats it. I don’t really feel okay talking about it with my dad, because I don’t think he’d really believe me. I don’t really think he believes in stuff like that. And i’m not as close with my mom as id like to be, so that would be weird af. I just watch videos, try and read up on it, and read other reddit user’s experience with social anxiety. I watch a ton of HealthyGamerGG, and try to apply that way of internalization to myself, trying to pretty much self dissect my mental space from the inside out.

(Sorry this is a ton to read, its sort of a vent in a way. My bad lol.)

But yeah, I’ve always been single throughout my whole life. School was kinda rough, and especially high school, when i git interested in dating. Ive always had socializing issues, and use to have VERY bad self worth issues, especially as a young kid. Very well hidden issues, that i never dared share with any one soul at all lol. Sorta internalized a lot of that stuff, and got used to the feelings. I still don’t share my issues with my family at all, but I’ve slowly built up a little bit of a since of self worth and still trying. But yeah, I felt very lonely and awkward in school years, and was frustrated a lot, not knowing how to connect to people, and not feel weird or wrong for trying. 

That shit absolutely got worse after graduation. I never went to college, and instead went to work with my dad as a diesel mechanic, because i had zero clue what i want to do. I was really depressed for a very long while. A lot of questioning my intrinsic worth as a person, and what i could possibly have to offer to the people around me. Felt like such a blank slate of a person, with no real value. 

I think thats still kinda lingers in my mind a bit, even given the fact that I’m now trying to build a sense of self worth (a lot of which i found in valuing my ideals, and my thoughts on how i like to treat people). Just this weight in my mind, that i have to amount to something, and have to be able to have skills and intrinsic worth as a person to be of value/worthy of attention and affection. Its not quite enough in my mind to just be me, of that makes sense. 

I want a partner bad. I just have this looming thing that feels like i can’t control it when it happens. Any advice would be so amazing.",1,1762827687.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It's been four weeks since the funeral, but things are getting tense.

Charlie and Sally Ann have gone home.
The house feels empty but not empty if you know what I mean.

But what gets me going now is that some say, especially close friends like you, Marylou.

 Time will heal, even though it doesn't seem real.

I know you and they mean well but saying, seeing is believing, but how can you and others see, what I'm feeling? 

While I'm still grieving, while the black hearse of loving is always leaving, whenever I look at our old photographs?

Leaving all once treasured things behind like scattered Autumn leaves.
.
Things like sweet perfumed love letters from our first meeting at university.

My twin golden engraved wedding ring.
Perfume filled white sweaters.

Memories of Christmas and holidays.

Fun seaside days away with Charlie and Sally Ann and enjoying all things once kind and divine, which once made our souls sing.

So, Marylou, it's a cruel lie, saying time will heal what I'm feeling.

For I struggle to live through each day, alone, now, she's gone.

For inside, I'm quietly dying.
The smiles fake as I deal with this almighty heartbreak.

Listening to people say at church or over coffee at Starbucks, seeing is believing, time will bring healing.

And, knowing deep down inside, how can they see what I'm still feeling when I'm obviously still grieving?

Always seeing the black hearse of love, leaving, and quietly going out of my mind:

Like a victim of organized crime.

After my marriage to the hand, I'll always love has run out of earthly time, and is no longer in your realm.

Breathing.

I apologize for sending this, but my smiles wearing thin as I see and hear her everywhere I look or go.

Next time I see you at church, we'll go for a coffee and talk about her.

I'm sure she'll love it.
Your old army buddy, Ralph.

1otxhrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCreepyPasta/comments/1otxhrg/the_blackened_shell_the_night_i_saw_bowsers_band/,“The Blackened Shell: The Night I Saw Bowser’s Band,"I don’t talk about this night often. Not because I’m scared—okay, maybe a little—but mostly because no one believes me. They think I’m trolling. But I swear on my limited edition Luigi’s Mansion GameCube: Bowser started a black metal band. And I saw them live.

It all started with a Craigslist ad. Yeah, I know. That’s already a red flag. But I was desperate. My doom metal band, Mushroom Doom, had just imploded after our bassist got radicalized by a Breath of the Wild speedrunning cult. I needed a new gig.

The ad read:

> “Seeking drummer. Must be able to blast beat at 300 BPM. Must not fear fire, spikes, or the void. No plumbers.”

I thought it was a joke. But the contact email was legit: koopa.king666@darknetmail.ru.

I replied with a link to my SoundCloud and a photo of me in corpse paint holding a double kick pedal like a battle axe. Ten minutes later, I got a reply:

> “You’re in. Rehearsal tonight. Bring earplugs. And a goat.”

I figured it was a gimmick band. Maybe a viral marketing stunt for a new Mario game. But I was bored and curious, so I packed my gear, grabbed a plush goat from my niece’s toy bin (close enough), and drove to the address.

It was an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese on the outskirts of town. The animatronics were still inside, but someone had spray-painted pentagrams over their eyes and replaced the ball pit with lava lamps and dry ice machines. The smell of burnt pizza and brimstone hit me like a Koopa shell to the face.

That’s when I saw him.

Bowser. In the flesh. Seven feet tall, spikes gleaming, wearing a leather vest with “BLOODSPINE” stitched across the back in crimson thread. His shell had been painted matte black with inverted crosses carved into it. He was holding a Flying V guitar the size of a surfboard.

“Yo,” he growled. “You the drummer?”

I nodded, too stunned to speak.

“Good. You’re late. Let’s melt some faces.”

The rest of the band was equally unhinged. On bass was Dry Bones, who played with his ribcage and occasionally detached his skull to scream backup vocals. On keys was Kamek, who summoned synth riffs from a cursed Moog that levitated and occasionally wept blood. And on rhythm guitar was a Chain Chomp in a studded collar, tethered to a mic stand and growling in 7/8 time.

We rehearsed for six hours straight. No breaks. No water. Just blast beats, guttural roars, and the occasional fireball. Bowser didn’t sing so much as roar lyrics in a language I’m pretty sure predates Latin. The songs had titles like “Throne of Molten Spines,” “Yoshi’s Final Breath,” and “Peachless Eternity.”

At one point, he turned to me and said, “Double kick harder. I want the floor to crack open and summon the Lakitus of the Abyss.”

I did. And I swear I saw something crawl out of the ball pit.

After rehearsal, Bowser handed me a contract written in what looked like Goomba blood. I signed it. I don’t remember why. Maybe it was the fumes. Maybe it was the music. Maybe it was the way he said, “We’re opening for Gorgoroth at the Underworld Coliseum.”

The gig was the next night.

I showed up in full corpse paint, only to be told that wasn’t “kvlt” enough. Kamek hexed me into a shadow version of myself. My skin turned grey, my eyes glowed red, and my drumsticks screamed every time I hit a cymbal. It was metal as hell.

The crowd was… not human. I saw Shy Guys in leather harnesses, Boos moshing through walls, and a Hammer Bro with a face tattoo of Mayhem’s Dead. Someone was selling bootleg shirts that said “BLOODSPINE: Koopa or Die.”

We opened with “Shellfire Baptism.” Bowser screamed into a mic made from a petrified Toad skull. The crowd went feral. I lost three cymbals and most of my hearing in the first song. Dry Bones exploded during the bridge and reassembled just in time for the breakdown.

Then came the finale: “Bowser’s Lament (Peach Rejected My Demo Tape).”

It was a 12-minute epic with a harp solo, a spoken word interlude in ancient Koopanese, and a wall of sound so intense it caused a dimensional rift. I saw glimpses of alternate timelines—one where Luigi was a warlock, one where Mario was a sentient fungus, one where Toad ran a black metal coffee shop called “Corpse Brew.”

When the last note hit, Bowser breathed fire into the crowd. Not metaphorically. Literally. Half the audience was incinerated. The other half cheered harder.

After the show, Bowser pulled me aside.

“You did good,” he said. “You’ve got the fury. The darkness. The tempo of torment.”

“Thanks,” I croaked, my throat raw from screaming backup vocals in Koopa Latin.

“But you’re too… alive.”

Before I could ask what he meant, Kamek hit me with a spell. Everything went black.

I woke up in my apartment. My drum kit was gone. My corpse paint was permanent. My cat won’t come near me. And every time I try to play music, my instruments whisper in tongues.

I tried to find the Chuck E. Cheese again. It’s not there. Just an empty lot with scorched earth and a faint smell of lava.

No one believes me. But sometimes, late at night, I hear blast beats echoing from the sewers. And if I listen closely, I can make out the lyrics:

> “No gods. No plumbers. Only pain.”

So yeah. Bowser started a black metal band. And I was their drummer. For one night.

And if you ever get an email from koopa.king666@darknetmail.ru… don’t open it.

Unless you’re ready to shred.

I see him a couple times a week when I go in, and we’ve had small interactions of mostly just him taking my order or making my drink. He’s always friendly, smiles, and sometimes makes little conversation, but I can never tell if he’s just being nice (as expected in customer service positions) or if there’s something more there.

I’d really like to talk to him more or at least start a small conversation beyond just ordering, but I feel awkward trying to do that while he’s working. I never know what’s “normal customer talk” versus what might come across as weird or flirty. I also get in my head and start overthinking it like, how do I even ask his name naturally without sounding creepy??

For anyone who’s had a crush on someone at their job (barista, cashier, etc.), how did you start actually talking to them more? What kinds of things can you say that don’t feel forced or interrupt them while they’re working?",1,1762827379.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

She’s fearful it may have fallen off of her finger while she was out. She had gone to Trader Joe’s but stopped at Re:Coffee first. We’ve both since re-traced her steps and have called/talked to many businesses along that way (TJ’s, Chili’s, Dave’s, Re: Coffee, Habit, etc.) so far nothing. 

We’re continuing the search at home and I will begin looking at pawn shops in the next day or so. The financial loss hurts, but the emotional toll of losing the ring is far greater.

Wasted months eating bland chicken and rice because I was scared to experiment. Finally figured out what actually works.

**The cheap staples:**

Oatmeal with banana for breakfast. Plain rolled oats cost like $3 for two weeks. Add almond butter if you want.

Rice and beans. Season with cumin and parsley instead of spicy shit. Make a huge batch on Sunday for the week.

Chicken thighs over breasts because they're way cheaper. Bake with olive oil and thyme. 5lb frozen bag is like $10.

Sweet potatoes are filling and don't trigger reflux. Bake a bunch at once.

Eggs. Skip the cheese and hot sauce. Cheapest protein there is.

**What helped me:**

Meal prep on Sundays. One big cook session covers most of the week. I do chicken, rice, roasted vegetables in 2 hours.

I started tracking what doesn't mess me up in a notes app, then switched to Gentlegourmet which lets you filter recipes by what to avoid. Saves time when meal planning.

Safe vegetables: broccoli, green beans, carrots, zucchini. Frozen is just as good and cheaper.

Snacks: bananas, almonds, crackers with almond butter.

**Avoid:** coffee, alcohol, chocolate, tomatoes, citrus, fried food, anything spicy.

Eating out sucks because everything has butter, garlic, and acid. Cooking at home is cheaper and safer.

TL;DR: Oatmeal, rice and beans, chicken thighs, sweet potatoes, eggs. Meal prep Sundays. Track what works for you. Stick to safe vegetables. Cook at home.",4,1762827305.0,acidreflux,3,0.83,False

1otxb7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1otxb7t/how_to_deal_with_the_aftermath_of_a_toxic_guy/,How to deal with the aftermath of a toxic guy while being in a healthy relationship for thr first time?,"I’ve been ignoring this for a while. It’s about my first time. I used to have a toxic boyfriend in [redacted city] a few months ago. He was manipulative and insecure. The kind of person who would say things like, “I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I’d be happy if you did it/sad if you didn’t,” etc. 

[Btw i was 20,f, he was 18-19, m]. It was long distance so 90% of it was through text. We only met and i stayed over at his place about 6 or 7 times at max but the relationship lasted 9 months.

I ended up deleting all my pictures from Instagram, stopped wearing tank tops or anything revealing in the summer, cut ties with my friends and family, and cried at least once a week because of fights with him. Now I’ve broken up with him and have a wonderful new boyfriend, but I keep thinking about my first time.

How was my first time with that toxic ex? It was my third day in [redacted city], and I was leaving the next morning. We’d done sexual things before, but never the actual act. That night, we drank, and we had just come back from a walk. He wasn’t drunk because he didn’t get drunk easily, but I did — I only weigh 48 kg — so I was tipsy. I don’t remember how we started talking about wanting to make love.

We went back to his apartment, and he immediately got undressed and started shaking his “thing” like he was in a hurry. He looked at me — I was barely sobering up — and said, “Hmm, it kinda bothers me that you’re not completely sober,” while continuing what he was doing. I said, “No, no, it’s fine, I’m okay, I want to do this,” and he said, “Alright then,” and just did it with me. We used condoms. I bled a lot.

We tried to make things comfortable for each other. It took a while for it to actually happen and for us to figure out how things worked. Around halfway through, I sobered up completely, and he kept overthinking whether it was okay since I hadn’t been fully sober. I kept reassuring him that it was fine.

Part of me considered it was sexual abuse, but another part wants to say he was just bad with emotional awareness — he never forced me when I said no; “no” was always “no.” Maybe he was just an immature kid who didn’t realize what it meant for me not to be fully sober, and his impatience got the better of him. You know the saying — he was thinking with the wrong head.

But at the same time, he had a foot fetish. I didn’t. Still, I said I was open to exploring. He licked my feet, and I was like, “Okay, I feel loved.” Then he said he wanted a foot job, and I said I didn’t want to, but I did it anyway. Sometimes when he was touching himself, he’d say, “Do something hot, surprise me. But not that, something else.” He also kept making me lick his butt, which I didn’t like, but I didn’t say anything. Once, when I did it, he farted in my face as a joke. He laughed. I’ve never felt so humiliated.

He also made me stay next to him while he pooped or hold his hand because if I waited for him in bed, he’d get upset. He once made me cut his toenails. Maybe he made me lick his feet once — I don’t even remember anymore.

That was just the sexual side. During fights, he’d always go cold and lifeless toward me, expecting me to figure out what was wrong. Whenever I tried to ask, he’d say, “You know what you did.” I never knew. He’d make me beg him to tell me, and when I finally got it out of him, it was always something so small that even he seemed ashamed to admit it.

Two examples: once, I had a photo on Instagram — just an outfit photo from a high angle — and he asked if I had posted it to make my chest look more noticeable, so other men could see it. The shirt was a fitted crop top, but not low-cut, the collar was up to my neck. And I have a small chest anyway. 

Another time, he got mad about graduation photos my classmates had posted of me wearing my prom dress, saying it was “too sexy” because there were maybe two centimeters of cleavage. I hadn’t even posted them myself.

When I tried to explain that posting photos was my way to build confidence after being bullied in the past, he punched himself in the face right in front of me. He did that often — hitting himself. His face was always bruised. He’d say I made him feel that way and then say, “Look what you’ve done to me.” Or, “What will my parents say? I’ll have to lie again and say it was from karate.”

I don’t think his parents even know I existed. His excuse was that he didn’t want to “bother his mom” with relationship stuff. I wasn’t allowed to hold his hand in public because he didn’t want to explain to anyone that he had a girlfriend, “in case we broke up again.” Which we did — three times. The third one was final, thank God. The first two times I went back because of my Stockholm syndrome and his manipulation.

Once, I asked if he could give me 5–10 extra lei (cash) so I could buy a book, and he said no. Then he got angry, saying he always paid for food when we went out because he worked and I didn’t, and that I should show gratitude by buying him small gifts. So I ended up buying him a plush toy for 80 lei.

He never bought me flowers. The only gifts I ever got from him were two sodas and some candy — in nine months of relationship. I, on the other hand, bought him an official merch T-shirt for 200 lei [he said he didnt want fakes], a handmade garland, and a book.

He’d always scold me when I bought something “too expensive” for myself, saying he could’ve found it cheaper somewhere else.

He also scolded me if I watched a show without him — he said he couldn’t watch things alone, so either I watched with him, or he’d find someone else to do it with. But when it came to shows he thought were “trash,” like Bridgerton or Demon Slayer, I could watch them alone.

If I ever looked away during something he recommended, he’d lose it. I wasn’t allowed to do anything else — just pay attention. He’d say things like, “Shave your p*ssy during your stupid Bridgerton, not during my masterpieces.”

He thought his tastes were superior. Everything I liked was “trash” or “L.” I once listed all my hobbies, and he said they were all “L” except the fact that I liked eating gyros.

[Im a singer] He said my voice was nice at first but got worse later. He’d make me sing covers from his favorite anime, and it was never good enough — he said I made everything sound like a manele (cheap pop).

He threatened to kill himself more times than I can count. He never did.

Once, he recommended me three beers (Nenea Iancu, Spitfire, Efes), and I said I didn’t like one of them — Efes. He got offended and said, “How dare you disrespect it and me like that? It’s an amazing beer — you just have no taste. Of course, you’d like piss like Heineken or [redacted local brand].”

I kissed a female classmate on the lips twice while i was out with friends and drunk. That was a week before breaking up with [this person] for the second time (we had three breakups). When we got back together and he found out, he called me a cheater, and to “earn forgiveness,” I stood outside on my balcony in the winter cold and tried to sleep there.

We started talking around may 25th 2024, became a couple on may 18th 2024, and broke up the first time on july 29th 2024. Broke up the second time on november 30th. And the last time on february 19th.

I was fed up, especially with his idea that “it’s not men’s fault they can’t control themselves — it’s women’s fault for dressing revealingly.”

He’d also get extremely mad if I bought anything from companies he thought were unethical — fast food places, or certain clothing brands. Once, when I got breakfast from [redacted coffee shop], he said, “I hope it gets stuck in your throat,” and I blocked him. We got back together again later because he texted me — and I, the idiot, replied. That was the only time he ever came to my city, [redacted city].

But on february 19th 2025 we broke up for good and now i have an amazing boyfriend already for almost 6 months, i love him, but sometimes my traumas from this ex come up and i dont know how to be a good or even sane girlfriend after all i had been through. 

I really needed a support group because i want people to hear my story and to remember they're not alone, and girl if you dont feel seen or respected, if you feel like something is wrong, then listen to yourself. Its not okay when you cry every night over a man. There is a good one out there. 

And also any advice on how to not be toxic or raise my walls up too much or think that im in danger when im not whem im with my boyfriend after all i had been through? ",1,1762827080.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

1otxabu,https://i.redd.it/et05q82xbj0g1.jpeg,The Year Thanksgiving Came in a Dented Pot,"Every year around this time, I reflect on the wildest, coldest, and most heartwarming Thanksgiving of my life. It was 1978, the year Boston disappeared under a blizzard, and my new wife, fresh from Ecuador and still learning what a “yam” even was, and I tried to make our first Thanksgiving from scratch. What followed was part survival story, part comedy, and one of the most honest Thanksgivings I’ve ever known.

I grew up in the Low Country of South Carolina, where Thanksgiving was a full-day celebration of gravy and goodwill. My mother’s table could bend under the weight of sweet potatoes, cornbread stuffing, and pies that could end wars. We were poor, sure, but on that day the house smelled like wealth itself: butter, collards, stale cigarette smoke, and forgiveness.

Fast-forward to 1978, and I'd traded all that warmth for a Boston, MA, that was all grey breath and frozen sidewalks. I was a half-starved medical student living mostly on caffeine and stubbornness. I’d just married a beautiful woman from Ecuador, still wide-eyed with wonder at this strange, snow-covered country. It was our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife, and her first Thanksgiving, period. She correctly thought it was some kind of ancient American harvest ritual, where people gave thanks by overeating and then falling asleep in front of football. I loved her for that. All I wanted was the smell of roasted turkey and piping hot gravy, the kind of meal that could make the world feel steady for one afternoon, even if you were broke, homesick, and a long way from the place where I first learned what love and gravy were made of.

Outside, the blizzard was gathering like a plot twist written by someone with a sense of humor. The wind pressed against the windows until they hummed. Inside, our Montgomery Ward 13-inch TV that I had bought off my cousin for five bucks and forever tilted slightly to the left, flickered between WKRP in Cincinnati reruns and Walter Cronkite’s calm baritone explaining that Boston had come to a full stop. The world beyond our walls had vanished under white, but in that tiny apartment, we sat wrapped in one blanket, her long black hair cascading around her caramel shoulders, while she rested her head on my shoulder, and the smell of Folgers coffee soothed our chilly bones. Two dreamers with more love than money, trying to build a holiday out of canned goods and imagination, inventing our first Thanksgiving from scratch. All we had was a scrawny bird with a smaller bust than Loni Anderson, a blizzard, and that feeling that somehow, we were exactly where we were supposed to be.

We lived in a drafty walk-up near Commonwealth Avenue, the kind of apartment where if you looked closely, you could see the mouse’s breath when he scurried by. He was a polite little thing, kept to his route, never stole more than a crumb, and sometimes paused by the radiator as if checking whether we were holding up as well as he was. Meanwhile, the radiator clicked like a preacher’s watch in a long sermon, steady, unbothered, faintly judging us.

We’d planned a modest meal: a small turkey, two potatoes, a tin of green beans, and a dream of a forlorn feast. By midmorning, the city was buried, the buses stopped running, and the power blinked out.

“So what now?” she asked, wrapped in the crocheted blanket my grandmother had made me before I left for college. “Now,” I said, striking a match, “we get creative,” while lighting some candles to imagine the little heat we had would not disappear in a Boston instant. 

A few minutes later came a knock that sounded like it had traveled through three decades of wallpaper.  
Mrs. O’Malley from down the hall stood there framed in the doorway like she’d just wandered out of a black-and-white movie. Her hair was in curlers, her robe a faded shade of bravery, and she carried half a bottle of sherry and a single pie crust balanced on a cutting board.  
“Well,” she announced, “my oven’s dead and my patience retired, so I’m declaring this a group project.”

Then came Ravi, the dental student from downstairs, with a sack of rice and the polite smile of a man prepared to eat anything warm. Next were George and Lillian from 2B, retirees armed with crusty sourdough, a can of mixed vegetables, and a can opener. They also brought a working handheld radio that was a lifesaver.

I pulled out my old green Coleman camping stove from the closet, and word spread that we had heat. One by one, they arrived, the neighbors I’d nodded to a hundred times but never really met. Someone brought beans. Someone else, a handful of chicken bouillon cubes, and so it went on.  

We emptied every offering into that battered pot, our little cauldron of faith, rice, canned vegetables, and a few noble scraps of pie crust drifting like lifeboats. My wife leaned over it, stirring with quiet purpose, her face lit gold by the candle flame. She smiled that soft new-country smile, the kind that makes the cold back down a little. Outside, the blizzard kept shouting, but inside she was performing quiet magic, turning leftovers, strangers, and sherry into something that felt a lot like grace. Grace was her name.

We sat cross-legged on the floor, candles flickering, snow slanting against the window. The pot steamed. The radio croaked out half a Bee Gees song before dying again. Mrs. O’Malley poured the rest of her sherry into the pot “for luck,” which also meant “for taste.”

The first spoonful was humble at best, haha. Thin, salty, uncertain of itself. But something happened in the silence that followed. Maybe it was the lack of heat, or the laughter starting to bubble up, or the fact that for the first time all day, no one felt alone. By the second spoonful, we were smiling. By the third, we were laughing. And by the fourth, that strange little stew had become something far greater than food. It tasted like kindness and luck and the steady faith that somehow, we'd all make it through that brutal winter storm.

I thought about my mother’s kitchen down South, how she’d feed anyone who wandered in, whether they brought a ham or just a story. And that night, in a frozen Boston apartment full of the people I usually passed in silence, I understood what she meant when she said, “We ain’t got much, but we got enough.”

When the lights finally flickered back to life late that night, no one wanted to leave. We cleaned the pot and promised to do it again next year, snow or no snow. And we did, every year until I graduated, and we moved on to build our own traditions.

That was my wife’s first Thanksgiving, our first Thanksgiving. It was the night I learned what home really means as an adult. It isn’t a table or a perfect meal or even a roof that keeps out the cold. It’s the warmth you build together when the world goes quiet and hard around you. My bride and I went on to share forty-one more Thanksgivings after that one, years filled with kids, grandkids, new homes, shifting traditions, and all the beautiful chaotic noise that comes with a full table. She beat the odds more than once, until she couldn’t. Breast cancer took her from us in 2019, but even now, when the air begins to have a morning bite, the sun becomes a deep shade of burnt orange and sits lower in the sky while the light softens in late November, I go back to that first year. That tiny apartment. That dented pot that I still have, except now it is the home to a Heartleaf Philodendron, her favorite plant. Those strangers who became family. Out of all the Thanksgivings in a lifetime, that one frozen, flickering, and full of Grace will always be my favorite.",15,1762827010.0,thanksgiving,6,0.94,False

The cemetery itself seemed peaceful, calm and quiet but not too quiet. We took some videos for the content. Prior to stepping onto the cemetery I explained what we would be doing, why and how long we would be there. I also said thank you to the land prior to leaving. After we were there for content my partner went to the car and I cleaned up some graves in the cemetery. This cemetery seemed very run down and like no one has touched it in years. There was broken tombstones,and weeds everywhere. I was pulling the weeds talking to the tombstones prior to doing it, again explaining what I am doing and why and how long, and saying there name out loud. I have cleaned cemeteries before and always have the same ritual. I was almost done when I went to pull a weed and got stung. My hand just radiated and then I saw a yellowjacket crawl out softly from the weeds and sit there. I put the weeds in my hand to the side away from the tombstones and apologized for abruptly leaving, not finishing and for bothering anyone who didn't want to be bothered. We left and I treated my sting. I also realized I never brought an offering which I usually do but the cemetery was a spur of the moment choice. We went to the cemetery on the 25th of October. I got a complication from an extraxtion I had a few days prior, and had to go in the 27th to get it fixed but had issues even with the fix its okay now, then I got a debilitating migraine and got sick several times and had to go home from work on the 30th, on halloween (31st) I fell really hard and hurt my knee and struggled to walk, its still healing but okay now. My partners car battery died randomly while getting coffee on the 1st of November and it was the same car we used to go to that area. I had a complication with my knee healing and needed to go get antibiotics and had to go get them on the 6th. It is now the 10th and everything seems to be stable now. I did do a ritual to honor the dead, cleanse and protect my household on sauin. My partner who doesnt even believe full in the paranormal even thinks I mightve mad something or someone mad. I have thought about going back to the cemetery to leave a double offering one to cover my first and another to apologize. I wouldn't go in just leave it by the entry. I wanted to apologize to the land again. Then go home do a cleanse and protection just in case. I do believe in ghosts but I don't normally jump to that as answer and totally was just accepting this has been bad luck until he said that. Now, I dont know. What do you think?  Do you think ghostly or just bad luck?

Taking control of your finances doesn’t have to feel like an overwhelming task reserved for accountants or financial experts. With the right approach, practical strategies, and a mindset focused on action, anyone can start steering their money in a direction that supports their goals and brings real peace of mind. Mastering personal finance isn’t about perfection—it’s about building small, consistent habits that compound over time, giving you the confidence to make money work for you.

Below, we’ve outlined 10 personal finance tips that can help you take command of your money, manage your spending, and plan for a secure financial future. Each tip is actionable, simple to implement, and designed to make a real difference in your financial life.

# 1)) Track Every Dollar You Earn and Spend

Before you can take control, you must understand exactly where your money is going. Most of us underestimate our spending, especially on small, recurring purchases like coffee, subscriptions, or takeaway meals.

**Action Steps:**

* Use a budgeting app or spreadsheet to log every expense for at least 30 days.
* Categorize expenses into essentials, discretionary, and savings.
* Review your spending weekly to identify patterns and opportunities to save.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Emily, a young professional, discovered she was spending nearly $150 a month on subscriptions she didn’t even use. Canceling these freed up money, she could redirect it toward building her emergency fund.

Tracking expenses gives you clarity and sets the foundation for all other personal finance decisions. It’s the first step toward taking control of your money because you can’t manage what you don’t measure.

# 2)) Create a Simple, Realistic Budget

A budget is a roadmap for your money, showing where it goes and ensuring that spending aligns with your priorities. The goal isn’t restriction—it’s freedom. A clear budget reduces stress, helps you save, and prevents debt.

**Action Steps:**

* Start with the 50/30/20 method: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, 20% for savings and debt repayment.
* Adjust the percentages according to your goals; for example, increase savings if you’re building an emergency fund.
* Automate allocations where possible, so bills, savings, and investments happen without you thinking about them.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Mike struggled to save because his budget wasn’t clear. After tracking his spending and implementing a simple plan, he set aside 20% of his income automatically, making his savings grow without extra effort.

# 3)) Build an Emergency Fund

Life is unpredictable. Unexpected expenses—like medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job changes—can derail your financial stability if you’re unprepared. An emergency fund acts as a financial safety net, giving you peace of mind and keeping you from relying on high-interest credit cards.

**Action Steps:**

* Aim for 3–6 months of living expenses in a separate, easily accessible account.
* Start small: even $500 can cover minor emergencies and prevent financial stress.
* Gradually increase contributions over time until you reach your target.

**Real-Life Example:**  
When Sarah’s car broke down, her emergency fund covered the repair without affecting her regular budget. She avoided debt and stress, reinforcing her control over her money.

# 4)) Pay Down High-Interest Debt First

Debt is one of the biggest obstacles to financial freedom. Credit cards, payday loans, and other high-interest obligations can quickly compound, eating away at your income. Focusing on eliminating these first is crucial for long-term control.

**Action Steps:**

* List all debts from the highest to the lowest interest rate.
* Prioritize paying off high-interest debts while making minimum payments on others (the debt avalanche method).
* Celebrate each payoff milestone—it reinforces motivation.

**Real-Life Example:**  
James had three credit cards with varying interest rates. By concentrating on the card with the highest interest first, he cleared it in six months, freeing up cash to tackle the next one.

# 5)) Automate Savings and Investments

One of the most effective ways to take control of your finances is to pay yourself first. Automating savings and investments ensures that your money is working for you, even when life gets busy.

**Action Steps:**

* Set up automatic transfers to a savings account or investment account on payday.
* Consider retirement contributions, like a 401(k) or IRA, to benefit from compound growth.
* Start with small, consistent contributions and increase over time.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Rachel automated $200 monthly into an investment account. Within a few years, compounding turned this modest amount into a substantial nest egg, all without extra effort.

# 6)) Monitor Your Credit Score and Report

A strong credit profile opens doors—better loan rates, mortgage approvals, and even rental opportunities. Knowing your credit score and understanding the factors that influence it allows you to make smarter financial choices.

**Action Steps:**

* Check your credit report for errors at least once a year.
* Pay bills on time and reduce outstanding debt to improve your score.
* Keep credit card utilization below 30% to maintain a healthy profile.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Tom discovered a late payment error on his credit report. By disputing it, his score jumped 50 points, allowing him to qualify for a lower-interest mortgage.

# 7)) Set Short-Term and Long-Term Financial Goals

Goals give purpose to your personal finance efforts. Without them, money can feel directionless. Whether it’s buying a home, traveling, or achieving financial independence, clear goals guide your decisions and spending habits.

**Action Steps:**

* Break goals into short-term (1 year), medium-term (2–5 years), and long-term (5+ years).
* Assign a dollar amount and a timeline for each goal.
* Review and adjust goals regularly to reflect changing priorities.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Linda wanted to save $5,000 for a home renovation in two years. By breaking it down into monthly targets and automating deposits, she achieved her goal without feeling deprived.

# 8)) Cut Unnecessary Expenses Without Feeling Deprived

Taking control doesn’t mean extreme frugality—it’s about making intentional spending choices. Small adjustments can free up significant resources for saving and investing.

**Action Steps:**

* Identify non-essential subscriptions, memberships, or impulse purchases.
* Practice mindful spending by asking: “Does this align with my goals?”
* Redirect savings toward debt repayment or investments.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Alex realized he spent $50 a month on takeout lunches. By preparing meals at home just three times a week, he saved $150 a month—money he funneled into his emergency fund.

# 9)) Educate Yourself About Personal Finance

Knowledge is power when it comes to money. Understanding the basics of budgeting, investing, taxes, and debt management gives you the confidence to make informed decisions.

**Action Steps:**

* Read books, blogs, and reputable online sources on personal finance.
* Attend workshops or webinars to learn strategies for your stage of life.
* Apply new knowledge gradually—small steps build lasting change.

**Real-Life Example:**  
After reading a book on investing, Naomi started contributing to a diversified portfolio. Within two years, she had a clear understanding of how to grow her wealth safely.

# 10)) Review and Adjust Regularly

Personal finance isn’t static. Life changes, goals evolve, and financial circumstances shift. Regularly reviewing your money habits ensures you stay on track and adjust strategies when needed.

**Action Steps:**

* Set aside time monthly or quarterly to review budgets, expenses, and savings.
* Compare actual spending to your plan and identify areas for improvement.
* Celebrate wins and make course corrections for setbacks.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Every quarter, Jordan reviews his spending and savings. He recently adjusted his budget to save more aggressively after receiving a raise, accelerating his journey toward financial freedom.

# Conclusion

Taking control of your money is a journey, not a one-time task. By implementing these 10 personal finance tips, you can gain clarity, reduce stress, and build a roadmap toward financial security. Tracking your spending, creating a budget, automating savings, tackling debt, and setting achievable goals are all actionable steps that put you in the driver’s seat of your financial life.

The key is consistency and patience. Even small steps—like canceling unused subscriptions, automating a small savings contribution, or reviewing your credit—add up over time. With determination and the right strategies, anyone can achieve financial confidence and take meaningful control of their money.",1,1762826793.0,LifeStylenaireMoney,0,1.0,False

1otx2q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1otx2q1/accidental_domme_21/,Accidental Domme (21),"Waking up early in the morning, Mark looked to his side to find Steffi partially asleep.  It was rare for him to wake up before her.  Slipping his arm under the blankets, he caressed her body.

She enjoyed his soft touch but tried to let him down gently.  “Not right now,” she whispered, keeping her eyes closed.

He leaned over to give her a quick kiss.  He then got out of bed to prepare for his day ahead.



\*\*\*\*\*

While in his office sipping coffee, Mark received a text from Steffi.  After some back-and-forth texting to ensure they were alone, he opened the incoming FaceTime call from her.

“I just wanted to see that you’re doing ok,” she said.

“Why wouldn’t I be?”  He looked puzzled.

“I know you can get all pouty when I deny you sex,” she elaborated.

“Oh no, I’m sorry about that.  I shouldn’t have woken you up on your day off.”

“So, what do you do in these situations?  Do you take care of it in your office?  Or do you go to the restroom?” she sincerely wondered with a playful tone.

He chuckled at her insinuation.  “You do realize I have the ability to control myself, right?”

“Really?  I thought you have no control when it comes to me,” she teased.  “Speaking of no control, why don’t you send me some money?  I need money for shopping later.”

“Well, you don’t need my money,” he lightheartedly challenged her.

“No, but you need to keep your girlfriend happy,” she replied, getting straight to the point.

“How much do you want?” he said, quickly acquiescing.

“Whatever you feel like sending,” she said, being intentionally vague.

About five minutes after ending their call, she saw a notification that she had received $300 from him.  Being pleasantly surprised by the amount, she felt a slight rush of excitement and looked forward to her day ahead.



\*\*\*\*\*

While walking along the promenade, Steffi pulled out her phone and initiated a FaceTime call with Mark.  After a brief moment, his image appeared on her phone.

“Hey, are you alone?” she asked.

“Yeah, I’m eating lunch in my office.  What’s up?”

“I thought we could spend some time together,” she offered.  “I’m not interrupting anything, am I?”

“This chicken salad is pretty tasty, but I guess I can make time for you,” he joked.

As they engaged in idle conversation, she found herself being constantly distracted while avoiding bumping into other people.  She pulled her phone closer to her body, holding it inconspicuously as she navigated the crowded walkway.  His mind wandered as he stared at his screen filled with her tight-fitting top.  Spotting an empty bench under the large tree, she sat down and returned her attention to him.

“So, what do you think?” she asked, continuing from where she left off.

“What was that?”

She raised her phone to her face after realizing his mind was elsewhere.  “Were you listening to what I was saying?  Or were too busy enjoying the show?”  She teased him, letting out a knowing smirk.

“Come on, can you really blame me?” he defended himself.

“I suppose not.  But I know that’s not the kind of show you enjoy.”  She repositioned herself and put her feet up on the bench.  Switching to the rear-facing camera, she positioned her phone such that her white platform sneakers were in the frame.  Without saying another word, she checked her social media feed.  After about ten minutes of silence, she switched back to the front-facing camera without warning.

Embarrassed at being exposed, he tried to hide his slightly flustered state.

“What are you doing?” she asked, unable to hide her grin.

“I’m just eating,” he fibbed.

“Yeah, I don’t think so,” she playfully called out his lie.  “I thought you didn’t do that in your office.”

“I don’t,” he said unconvincingly.

“So how much was that little show worth to you?” she pressed without a hint of irony.

“What are you, a cam girl now?” he asked facetiously.

“No, I’m your girlfriend,” she stated the obvious with a hint of irritation.  “If you want to tell me no, you can just say that.  You don’t need to keep coming up with witty excuses.”

He looked at her with a conflicted expression.

“Mark, you’re so cute.”  She smiled at him.  Knowing he was incapable of denying her always made her more insatiable.  “Well, I’ll let you go now.  I have more shopping to do, and you should probably get back to work.”

1otx2ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1otx2ce/im_28_years_old_making_115k_in_baltimore_this/,"I’m 28 years old making $115k in Baltimore, this week I play pickup kickball and finish 3 books","[I wrote another long Money Diary 3 years ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/10djec8/i_am_25_years_old_live_in_austin_tx_and_made/) it will be interesting to see what changed and what stayed the same since then! As the kids these days like to say, I'm a yapper, so consider yourselves warned.

Important context not directly related to income is that I relocated from my home city of Austin, TX to Baltimore, MD about 6 months ago because of my partner's career. I tracked expenses and kept a sparse moving diary, planning to post it here, but still haven't cleaned it up enough to share.

***Section One: Assets and Debt*** 

* **Retirement Balance:** $197,400 
   * $30.4k in my old company’s 401k, $96.5k in my current company’s 401k, $70.5k in my Roth
* **Checking:** $1440
* **Savings:** $62,720 
   * $22k HYSA emergency fund, $22,200 in various HYSA sinking funds ($7.5k of this is my Roth IRA contribution for 2026 since I do a lump sum at the beginning of the year, a lot of the rest is saving for extensive 2026 travel and some new tech), $18,000 in bonds and money market for engagement ring, wedding and/or down payment, $520 in my checking bank’s savings account to maintain a minimum balance.
* **Brokerage:** $13,090 mostly in random individual stocks 
* **HSA:** $6500ish
* **Equity:** N/A
* **Credit card debt:** N/A I pay off my credit card every month
* **Student loan debt:** N/A, went to school on a full ride scholarship + stipend and worked in summer to cover any remaining expenses

My partner “M” is in medical residency making \~$75,000. We split living expenses but we don’t combine finances and we have not ever sat down and looked at the specific numbers in each other’s accounts. We will be doing this as part of the process of getting engaged and wedding planning in the next 2 years. I know they contribute to retirement, have comfortable savings/investments (managed by their parents), and they do not have debt. 

***Section Two: Income***

**Income Progression:** I've been working at my current company and in my current field for almost 4 years. 

* **2022: $65,000.** Started at my current company in entry level sales. Base pay was around $35-40k, I hit almost 200% of quota.
* **2023:** **$87,000.** Got promoted in spring and got a base pay bump to around $55k-$60k, kept blowing out my quota.
* **2024:** **$112,500.** I was promoted to a new role in summer and got a base pay bump to \~$80k. I blew out my quota in both roles.
* **2025: \~$115,000.** Got a merit raise in spring to $83,000 base pay but I’ve struggled to hit quota most months. 

I talked about switching companies and getting into sales in my previous money diary, you can read more details there if you’re interested! I still like sales and am glad I made the jump but the last year and a half has been super dicey with multiple of my managers getting unexpectedly laid off or quitting.

Going remote because of moving earlier this year for M’s residency will block me from getting promoted or receiving future merit raises due to a new company policy. As a result I have started casually looking and marked myself open to work on LinkedIn, leading to me being contacted by the recruiter who appears in my diary this week.  

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $3246 base pay (gross: $6384 base pay), I talk about commission below. 

My take home is so low because I’m **contributing 25% to my 401k** so I can max it out this year. I was contributing 20% but bumped it up a few months ago since my commission checks got smaller. My employer matches up to 6%. I contribute about **$230/month to an HSA.** My health insurance is heavily subsidized by my company if we get a (free) preventive blood panel and answer some preventive health questions once a year, **medical/dental/vision is $74/month.** 

Commission varies a lot. Because the team I support hasn’t been hitting quota, **my after-tax/401k take home for my August, September and October commission checks was $0, $1160, and $602 respectively.** If the team were hitting or overattaining, my commission take home would be $1160 a month or more. I save/invest my commission take home pay and live off my base. 

I win a lot of sales contests at work and can make a couple hundred dollars a month in company points that I redeem for gift cards, so this also supplements my income.

Right now I don’t have other income outside my main job. 

***Section Three: Expenses***

**Rent: $875/month.** M and I live in a 2b/2b rowhome and split the $1750 rent 50/50. 

**Renters insurance: $131/year** through Lemonade

**Car insurance:** **$151/month** through Geico, surprisingly cheaper than it was in Texas

**Savings & investment contributions:** Whatever’s left after monthly expenses - varies a lot because of commission variance. I talked about my 401k and HSA contributions above. 

**Monthly donations: $25 to the Human Rights Campaign, $26.19 to the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund, $25 to Doctors Without Borders, $104.90 to UNICEF, $102.40 to the Baltimore Tree Trust.** Uneven numbers are because I opted in to cover payment processing fees. I have been donating to the HRC and Doctors Without Borders for almost 4 years, to the PCRF for 2-3 years, and to UNICEF and BTT since this summer. 

**Utilities & Wifi:** **N/A.** M pays for utilities and wifi and I pay for all groceries. I suggested this after a few months of 50/50 splitting everything because their name is on the utilities, I meal plan, grocery shop and cook for us 99% of the time, and it’s a hassle to constantly follow up on my weekly payment requests and remind them to send me a monthly payment request for utilities (because of the hours they work this wasn’t happening very quickly and it was causing completely unnecessary friction around finances to develop). This works well because I make 30-40% more than they do and utilities+wifi come out to around $200ish on average while groceries and household essentials hover around $400-$450 a month, so it feels more fair for our respective incomes as well as our habits and preferences. 

**Cell phone:** **$50/month** to my mom (still on the family plan) 

**Therapy:** I get 12 free therapy sessions per year through my work which I only realized a few months ago after almost 4 years working here, so I’m going to therapy twice a month right now. I don’t know what I will do in 2026 once I run out of sessions because I wouldn’t be able to afford my therapist ($200/session) without making changes to my charitable giving or my retirement, and I don’t think therapy helps me enough to be worth that.

**Apple cloud storage: $0.99**

**Gym membership: $139** for 8 OrangeTheory classes per month. I am traveling a lot in November/December but plan to upgrade to the unlimited class plan in 2026 and go to 3-4 classes a week. Since switching from bouldering and heavy lifting to OrangeTheory from necessity/convenience when I relocated to Baltimore this year, I found out I really enjoy running!

**Paid hobbies:** N/A on a monthly basis - my main hobbies besides working out are reading books from the library and making art. I've hoarded art supplies for a while and the tech I use for my digital art is fairly new and in good shape. I expect to make big tech purchases every 5-6 years and I'll be due for a PC in the next 1-2 years. If I run out of a specific art supply I will buy it but due to the hoarding and not actively creating art for many years, this hasn't been an issue recently.

***Section Four: Background***

**Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?**

Yes, my parents and grandparents all went to college and my dad has an advanced degree. It was assumed that my siblings and I would go to college as well, and we all did. I did not want to take on debt or loans so I went to a state school that offered me a full ride + stipend. My parents contributed by sending me $100 or $200 a month while I was at college and feeding me/letting me stay in their house for free when I was home for the summer. I am grateful to my past self for avoiding student debt although now I wonder if I was almost too paranoid of it. 

**Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parents educate you about finances?**

My parents always stressed the importance of saving and of tithing 10% to church and when we started getting a small allowance (like $10-15 a month) my mom would show us how to separate it into $1 for church, at least $1 or $2 for savings (I always saved more), and spending the rest. They talked about debt and budgeting a lot because they went through a big Dave Ramsey phase when I was a kid while working to pay off my dad’s student debt; I fondly remember my mom's cash envelopes every month. They were very cautious of credit cards and did not have any that I am aware of. 

My parents also emphasized family, faith, and values over having a lot of money. This message was contradicted for me, to some extent, by extended social interactions in my preteens and teens with people who were much wealthier than our family (donors to the nonprofits my parents worked for, my maternal grandparents, families from church who I babysat for, families who lived in the wealthy public school district my parents transferred me into for high school). The explicit message from my parents was that money should not be important but the implicit message from being around so many wealthy people was that money could obviously get you a nice house, more social power/respect, and a better life with more opportunities than I felt like I had as a teenager, especially traveling to other countries and going to good colleges without worrying about debt. Does anyone else relate to this? Anyway, despite the contradictions I’m grateful for the solid foundation and values around money that I got from my parents.

**What was your first job and why did you get it?**

I started a pet care “business” as a 10 year old and did that for a few years with the help of my mom (it was not lucrative), then switched to babysitting for church families. My first ""real"" job with a paycheck was summer of my freshman year of college as a children’s art camp counselor making \~$13/hr. The next year I got promoted to a supervisor making around $14 and kept working that job through college. I want to say I grossed about $5000 a summer with that job. 

**Did you worry about money growing up?**

A little bit. We got some free food and a lot of hand-me-down clothes from groups at church and my dad’s post-graduate school, and outside of hand-me-downs we mostly got clothes at the thrift store. I thought we were more food insecure than we really were - I learned a few years ago that when my mom wouldn’t buy milk when we ran out it was because she was just waiting to go to the store on the weekend, not because we couldn’t afford it. I always had 3 healthy meals a day and snacks, I always had clean clothes and new shoes that fit and plenty of toys, and although I always shared a room with a sibling until graduating high school and moving out, we never experienced housing insecurity. I would describe my family growing up as indebted working middle class, and I would say my parents are now solidly upper middle class.

**Do you worry about money now?**

Yes. It seems clear to me that even if you have plenty of money saved/invested and you make all the right choices, it only takes one or two health emergencies or a long period of unemployment to wipe you out unless you come from extreme generational wealth. If you’re fortunate enough to make it through a long and happy life with no bad luck or health scares, good quality assisted living and end of life care is incredibly expensive and I don’t think we will fully fix the healthcare and insurance system in the US in my lifetime, though I have faith we’ll make strides toward it. When I think about possible elder care expenses, I don’t know if I’ll ever believe that I have “enough”. That’s without even considering what will happen when my parents get old.

**At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?**

I became mostly responsible for myself when I moved out at 17 to go to college: I had to pay my own rent, food, car insurance, and any expenses that weren’t covered by my scholarship. My parents kept me on their health insurance and covered my cell phone bill until I graduated and got a job. My parents would let me move in with them if I ever became homeless, but I don’t think monetary support would be on the table.

**Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?**

No and I don’t expect to. 

**Money Diary**

**Sunday** 

**AM:** I wake up before my alarm and flop around in bed for a bit wondering why I’m awake - I only remember daylight savings time ended when M gets up and mentions they’re not used to being up when it’s light out. They kiss me goodbye and go to work. 

I get up around 7:30 and make coffee in my Aeropress with half caffeinated and half decaf coffee. I’ve been trying to cut my coffee and caffeine intake for a while. I play Wordle, Connections and Strands and text the results to my mom - our new daily ritual since I moved out of Texas earlier this year. I finish a sketchbook drawing and then talk on the phone to my mom for 30 minutes while she walks in her neighborhood. She shares what’s going on with the extended family since someone recently passed away, then we talk about work and having gratitude for our flexible and well paying jobs even when we’re not feeling challenged enough and having feelings that the grass might be greener elsewhere. As usual we close the call without my mom mentioning M, my partner of 3 years who I moved up here to live with. 

After wrapping up the call with my mom I drive to the grocery store and get our groceries for the week: produce, lunch meat, cereal, pantry items, yogurt, butter, and milk for our normal groceries, a protein shake for my breakfast, and extra onions, a 2lb roast, beef broth & gruyère cheese for my main planned meal this week **($87.88).** The store appears to have replaced M’s favorite Chipotle Bitchin’ Sauce with some random hummus dip thing and I also need white wine for my special meal of the week, so I know I will need to run another errand when I get home.

*\*A note about groceries - I currently pay for groceries with gift cards I get from my company using employee points I win in vendor contests. I’m tracking it as an expense to give a better picture of my COL, but I’m technically not paying for it with my “own money” out of my paycheck.*  

Once I’ve driven home and unloaded the groceries I walk to the harbor to visit Whole Foods. We don’t like to shop at Whole Foods more than we absolutely need to but it’s nice to have a grocery store within walking distance for last minute needs… and Bitchin’ Sauce. Before going to the store I sit down in a park by the harbor to enjoy the gorgeous day and start my new sketchbook with a watercolor of the fall foliage. I also pick some colorful leaves off the ground to draw later. I get Bitchin’ Sauce **($5.99)** then grab white wine and bourbon at the local liquor store **($63.25)**. On my walk home I stop at our neighborhood bakery/cafe for a smoked salmon bagel sandwich and a spiced brown sugar latte **($19.91).**

**PM:** I put away the groceries, eat my bagel sandwich, and fool around with a new camera tripod trying to get it to mount my phone perfectly before settling for good enough and filming myself making colored pencil drawings of the leaves I brought home. I am slowly accumulating footage of myself drawing in tentative plans of relaunching my old animation YouTube channel this year. I remain absorbed in this activity for the rest of the afternoon. 

Around 5 I make pancake batter to use up our leftover buttermilk from when we made Halloween sugar cookies last week. M gets home around 5:30, says hi to me, and takes a nap. While they nap and the pancake batter sits I make myself a Bourbon Renewal. We inherited a TON of random liquor from M’s aunt’s deceased friend earlier this year after all her other friends had picked out their choices and this is my drink of choice to slowly use up the creme de cassis. Here’s to you, M’s aunt’s friend. While enjoying my drink I scroll on reddit + watch other artists’ sketchbook tours on YouTube.

I wake M up around 6:30 and start throwing pancakes on the griddle. They taste so good with maple syrup and homemade blueberry compote I threw together on the side. Later we watch Song of the Sea and Star Wars Visions: Screecher’s Reach, two beautiful and Halloween-y animated stories by Irish creative powerhouse Cartoon Saloon. After the movie I do a watercolor study of a drawing by Tomm Moore and go to bed. My heart is pounding and my stomach hurts with anxiety while I think about how I’m a terrible friend and the people I asked for professional references last week probably hate me and think I’m just trying to use them, but I know this is irrational and I eventually get to sleep. 🥲

**Total: $177.03**

**Monday**

**AM:** I get up at 7. M stays in bed because they are switching to night shift tonight (residency is brutal). I sit in our sunroom and drink the last of my green mint tea. I got this tea in a sample pack from a local tea shop and it’s now my favorite thing to drink in the morning besides coffee or matcha, so I’ll need to get more soon. I play Wordle/Connections/Strands and text the results to my mom, do a Japanese lesson on Busuu and briefly scroll on instagram. 

At 7:30 I log in to work, message my team, write out my schedule for the day in my hourly planner and start replying to customer emails in between prepping the pot roast (browning roast & onions, then adding all ingredients to the crockpot). Once everything is in the pot I settle in to pull some pipeline reports for my team and continue replying to emails. Today looks like a light day for calls, I just have an internal training at 1, so it will be lowkey unless something comes up. I hope today I get the offer from the job I was interviewing for so I can reject it and ditch some of this anxiety. 

I’m hungry at 10:30 and crush a couple leftover pancakes with peanut butter, fresh blueberries and raspberry jam. The dentist office texts asking if I want to reschedule my appointment next week for tomorrow morning but I specifically scheduled it for my day off next week so I say no. I have a cheese stick and pear as a snack and eat some leftover chili for lunch… I’m feeling extra hungry today and I think it’s because I can smell the pot roast cooking. 

**PM:** The afternoon is so slow and I don’t have any leads to call. Times like these make me believe getting laid off would feel like a mercy killing. I wish I could log off and work on art instead of waiting around like this feeling my brain liquefy. 

M gets up around 3 and runs some errands. I finish work at 5 and immediately start working on the French onion soup since I know the onions will take a long time to caramelize. M comes back home and eats pot roast dinner while we chat, then they head off to work around 6 without getting to taste the soup since the onions are still not caramelized (!!!). I keep stirring the onions, drinking the leftover white wine from the recipe and reading Billions and Billions by Carl Sagan, which I finish in the time it takes them to caramelize. Around 7:15 I finally finish the onion soup… next time I have to try Julia Child’s method of adding some sugar to help them brown faster. I eat the soup with toasted sourdough and grated gruyère on top and it’s transcendent. Worth the wait! I only wish M were here to enjoy it with me, they’ll get some tomorrow.

After showering I do some pen and watercolor studies of hands and go to bed at 11 (later than ideal) worrying about how I’m going to feel in the morning because of the wine. I had 2 glasses and was done before 8 but I've been extremely sensitive to alcohol the last couple years so I usually don’t drink anything the night before workouts. At least I don’t feel the anxiety symptoms from last night as I drift off. 

**Total: $0**

**Tuesday**

**AM:** Wake up at 5:30, snooze my alarm once, then drag myself out of bed because I have to get to my fitness class. I’m out the door at 6 and I’m worried I’ll be late but I get there right at 6:15 as class is starting. I feel less yucky from the wine than I expected but it affects my performance… I go super slowly and feel like I’m moving through mud. It’s still a good workout. 

I get home at 7:30 and make a half caf Aeropress cup of coffee. M arrives shortly and vents about their bad night at work. A young patient died and later they felt flustered and humiliated when they couldn’t answer a rapid fire question about another patient’s condition at the end of their 12 hour shift. Medical residency is an emotional meat grinder. I hug and comfort them for a while, then I log in to work and they go to bed. 

As usual I time block my day, reply to emails, follow up with customers and send out a report of my team’s extremely poor performance last week. Having my performance reviews and my pay tied to these people’s performance makes me feel hopeless and I don’t know what to do. It feels like I’ve tried everything to help them and now it’s making me resent them (and our leadership, for seemingly not putting in much of an effort to help us fix this). I know this is a down cycle in sales, the problem is I’m not used to ever having down cycles. I almost never did when I was responsible for my own individual quota. 

I play NYT games, text my mom, do Busuu Japanese, and eat more peanut butter pancakes. I spend most of the morning reaching out to customers and talking (read: complaining) with my coach/engineer, who commiserates and agrees with everything. I eat a turkey/cheese/lettuce/tomato sandwich for lunch and read all of Sun Horse Moon Horse by Rosemary Sutcliff since it’s due back at the library. Beautiful and disturbing little historical fiction chapter book about the Uffington White Horse, 10/10 would allow my future children to be traumatized by it. 

**PM:** I go to my team’s 1+ hour quarterly kickoff call then follow up with more customers and send out quotes until 5. 

After work I give my recruiter a call back, she fills me in on the company’s process to get an offer put together for me and I think about how bad I feel that it got this far because I do not plan to take this job (and knew I did not want it from the moment the recruiter first messaged me). I thought I would get rejected earlier in the interview process. I cuddle with M for a bit then sketch until they officially wake up. We eat leftover pot roast and french onion soup with sourdough+gruyere and they go to work. 

I watch some sketchbook videos and buy a ticket to see Little Amelie or The Character of Rain on Friday night **($16.70)**. I’m happy to check this off my to-do list! They recently announced they’d be screening Cartoon Saloon’s newest animated short Eiru before all theater showings of Little Amelie, as if I wasn’t excited enough to see Little Amelie already. The last time I saw a movie in a theater was Sinners with M and before that, according to my memory and my email receipts, it was Wolfwalkers way back in 2020 (besides going to my eccentric film buff friend’s birthday party in a rented out theater last year). 

My soft, beloved around-the-house red hoodie that I’ve had since college is falling to pieces so after a lot of pondering tonight I order a like-new dark red Nike hoodie to replace it on Poshmark **($31.93)**. I looked at hoodies last week too but didn’t pull the trigger, I have a hard time letting go and I'm so picky about my ""comfy"" clothes :( But now I can check this off my to-do list too, yay! I make a lowball offer on a merino wool sweater in one of my best colors (rust) I liked a few weeks ago and it’s accepted **($23.45)**. I saved $2000 to refresh my wardrobe this year and have spent less than $200 of it because I don’t know what clothes I want to wear anymore, probably due to falling back into depression last fall and experiencing severe body image issues. I guess it makes sense that when I don’t even know “what” I look like, I wouldn’t know “how” I want to look either. 

I do more watercoloring then go to bed. 

**Total: $72.08**

**Wednesday**

**AM:** I toss and turn for an hour after my alarm goes off, then get up. M gets home while I am making coffee at 7, they had a much better and sillier night compared to yesterday and I’m happy to hear about it. They eat breakfast while I do my usual morning routine in the sunroom (NYT games, Busuu Japanese & Spanish, text mom). M goes to bed and I faff about on social media until work time. I have Greek yogurt, granola and frozen blueberries for breakfast. 

This morning I have 2 hours of back to back internal meetings. What we cover in the meetings reminds me of my ongoing stress about my job, and my coworker and I vent to each other in DMs about the expectations being placed on us while the expectations for the teams that our income and performance metrics depend on appear to be lowering. A vendor sends us all a Doordash giftcard and that cheers me up a bit. I help a few customers who are having issues. My body is not coping well with the half caf two days in a row but at the same time it’s not as bad as I feared. 

**PM:** During lunch I return the 2 books I finished. My heater is blowing cold air on the drive to and from the library, oh boy. I’ll see what it’s doing tomorrow morning. I hope I don’t have to write about using some of my e-fund on a car emergency, this car has been so great for me with no problems. Home, eat leftovers, work. 

The coach who supports my team ghosts me on the expectations meeting they asked to have with me. The team I support gets a last minute meeting put on their calendars so their manager can tell them their quotas for last quarter are being retroactively raised. No wonder morale is at an all time low. I follow up on open deals, send out a few quotes and am done. 

I eat dinner with M, they cheer me up and then go to work. I shower then work on drawing theater poster concepts for the play my friend is producing and sketching with markers for 3 hours until I go to bed around 10:15. 

**Total: $0**

**Thursday**

**AM:** I wake up an hour before my 5:30 alarm, thanks daylight savings, and toss and turn with anxiety about my job and the state of the country (politics makes me think about my flight home for Thanksgiving, that makes me think about being around my family, that makes me think about how ""it gets better"" has never felt true for me with my parents...). 

My alarm goes off, I hit snooze and get up after 10 minutes to go to Orangetheory. My car heater is working now so that’s good - maybe it felt cool yesterday because the car was warm from sitting in the sun? At the workout I feel awful, slow and behind and about to burst into tears the first half of the workout but once I get on the treadmill, running fixes my mood right up and I end the class happy, peaceful and sprinting my fastest speed ever! 

When I get back from working out M is already home, we chat while I make matcha. They are feeling down because of how little we’re seeing each other with their night shifts which will be continuing for 2 weeks with only 1 day off per week, which is especially tough for night shifts because it doesn’t give them time to reset their sleep schedule. We agree to talk more this evening, and they go to bed. 

I am so glad it’s Thursday as I log in to work and plan my day after playing the NYT games and texting my mom. When I time block my day I see I have therapy back to back with 2 business meetings. Oh joy. My morning is free so I plan some outbound calling and scroll around on LinkedIn while drinking a protein shake. I follow up on open deals and book an order (not from my follow ups, just a customer randomly reaching out). 

Later I make delicious microwave oatmeal with peanut butter, molasses, egg whites and some milk and start calling customers. I get a text from a new acquaintance who I met at a volunteer event inviting me to play kickball with their team tonight and I accept because I need to get out of the house. 

**PM:** I go to therapy and it’s fine, we don’t talk about anything really deep, but we go over some strategies for how to cope mentally with all of the upsetting/depressing things that are happening in the world. I have a meeting with my team and after that the afternoon actually picks up and I’m kept busy working with customers and setting up calls which is great! 

After work M wakes up and we talk about our relationship, hug and cry a little bit until it’s time for them to eat and get ready to go to work. I make air fryer potatoes and cook some bell peppers, onions and scrambled eggs. M goes to work and I go to the park to play kickball! It’s cold and dark but we have a really fun time and lose the championship in spectacular fashion. We hang out on the bleachers afterward to cheer for the teams playing after us and share a little celebratory fireball and champagne since it’s the last game of the season, a season in which I played exactly 2 games counting this one. I’m happy to be included and I think it will be fun to hang out with these people more. 

My fingers are freezing cold when I get home. I take a long, warm shower and eat a mug brownie (subbing almond powder instead of flour to at least bump the protein/fiber content) while scrolling around on reddit. I planned to do art but that is not in the cards. I watch youtube videos, finish rereading Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH which I’ve been casually working away at since picking it off my bookshelf on Tuesday, and go to bed around midnight because the rodent drama had me in a chokehold.

**Total: $0**

**Friday**

**AM:** It’s COLD outside (36 degrees) so I stay in bed until I hear M get home around 7:15, then I get up and make matcha. We have another conversation about our relationship and it ends in a really good place. They go to bed and I go to work, check emails, plan my day and complete some monthly training. You know the drill by now: I play NYT games and text my mom, then do Busuu Spanish. I use credit card points to pay my UNICEF donation because my credit card has an extra 25% promotion on points used for certain charities, and pay my credit card balance for the last month. M texts me that they renewed our annual aquarium membership this morning so I zelle them my half **($92.50)**. The National Aquarium is amazing and very close to us. An annual membership pays for itself in 2 visits and we go a lot more frequently than that. 

Three of my teammates just had babies, my manager sends out a diaper fund announcement asking for at least $5 per baby. I venmo them $10 per baby **($30)**. The morning is busy and I set up a customer call for the afternoon. At lunch I walk to the bakery to replenish our supply of whole wheat sourdough and resist the temptation to get a sandwich or drink **($9.44)**. I eat leftovers for lunch.

**PM:** Busy afternoon full of quotes and customer calls. I get another doordash giftcard from a vendor and redeem it to my growing stash. Even though my team is missing quota I’m still winning vendor contests so when I get a minute to breathe I cash out the $225 company points I won last month into a grocery store giftcard. I finish the day by sending out meeting invites for next week, working past 5. 

The recruiter texts at 5:30 PM asking me to call her but I don’t see the text right away due to the busy work evening and I also don’t really want to talk. M comes up to eat dinner and I sit with them, after they eat we cuddle on the couch before they go to work and I go to see Little Amelie, hooray! The movie theater where it’s showing is 20 minutes away, themed after an ancient Egyptian temple, and it’s SO COOL. Because going to the movies is such a rare experience for me I buy popcorn **($7.42).** Things are a little weird when I get into the theater because a guy is settled very comfortably into my seat next to his partner, but it ends up not being a big deal because the theater isn’t full so even though he seems really apologetic and offers to move I just let him keep the seat and sit in a different, equally optimal one. I’m confused about why he sat in my seat in the first place but I prefer not to make a big deal out of it. The movie is very green and purple, and very French. It’s visually stunning and I’m so glad I watched it on the big screen. It feels like an early birthday present to myself (it will be out of theaters next week, my real birthday week). The 20-minute night drives there and back feel like an early birthday present to myself too. I’m happy I live somewhere I don’t have to drive much because of the environmental and financial benefits, but I love driving and listening to music to be alone with my thoughts and unwind.  

At home I shower, make a cup of ginger turmeric tea, skim/reread the play my friend is putting on and make more drawing concepts for their play posters. I watch artists’ sketchbook tours on youtube and go to bed a little before 12. 

**Total: $139.36**

**Saturday**

**AM:** I wake up as M is getting home at 7:45 so we cuddle for a while and they talk about work. They have breakfast while we talk some more, they play me a new Rosalía song and I tell them about my movie experience. They go to bed and I make coffee, play NYT games, text my mom and do Busuu Spanish. I switched away from Duolingo two months ago because of dissatisfaction with their business practices and an unforeseen added benefit of changing to Busuu has been that Busuu Spanish is way more on my level (as someone who does “know” Spanish, just doesn’t use it). It’s helping me expand my vocabulary and review grammar that Duolingo never showed me any time during my 4 year streak. To balance out my gushing about the Spanish grammar, the Busuu app is extremely buggy compared to Duolingo and it’s depressing.

I text the recruiter that it was a busy day at work yesterday and I’ll call her on Monday. I scroll on reddit for a while and make my grocery list, I will be making mafe (Senegalese peanut stew) for my birthday week since it is one of my favorite foods. It’s super simple and inexpensive to make, I’m just always trying new recipes so I haven’t made it since February. 

I eat my usual Greek yogurt + granola + frozen blueberries for breakfast and walk to the farmer’s market with my sketchbook. I buy a HUGE bell pepper and a couple sweet potatoes for my mafe **($5.54)** and sketch people for a while, then I walk to the local spice and tea shop and get more mint green tea and also a cinnamon, apple and rooibos tea I’m excited to try **($27.98)**. Then I walk home, book a haircut for next week, and make a reservation at a new neighborhood cat cafe for myself and M tomorrow afternoon **($20)**. 

I’m hungry so I make a “charcuterie board” out of random stuff in the fridge - grapes, blueberries, apple, red pear, slice of sourdough, cheddar, leftover gruyere - and eat it while starting Gravity and Grace by Simone Weil. Technically, what I read is mostly the extremely long and pretentious introduction by the guy who compiled her writings post mortem, it’s longer than the actual chapters of the book. For the rest of the afternoon I draw: more poster design concepts for my friend, color/shadow on my farmer’s market sketches, and pen+watercolor sketches of the pumpkins and candles on our kitchen table. I film this last bit.

I realize it’s almost 5:30 and I’m hungry so I make myself a turkey sandwich with cheddar, lettuce and tomato. M comes up and eats dinner around 5:45, we hug and kiss and have a little chat. I tell them about booking the cat cafe tomorrow like we talked about doing for their day off, yippee! We’re both so excited to see the cats. They go to work, I scroll on instagram for a bit - bad habit I regained due to posting more art on instagram, I need to kick it, it does not help my stress levels - and make myself a Bourbon Renewal. We’ve come full circle. 

I watch youtube videos, scroll around on reddit, make myself an old fashioned and decide to finally (!) see what all the KPop Demon Hunters hype is about. The movie is fun but a little overhyped… except for the music, that’s as catchy as everyone has been saying. When the movie is done I transition to my favorite buzzed activity: watching Warrior Cats AMVs on YouTube. I can see the white ¾ moon rising between the blinds through the window right in front of me at my desk on the third floor, it’s beautiful. I continue watching YouTube videos of art, cooking and swing dancing (discovering the absurdly talented Emeline Rochefeuille, wow!) until around 12:30 AM when I go to bed.

**Reflection** 

This was an abnormally high spend week for me, I’d say most weeks I hover around $200-$300 and that’s with going on a weekly dinner date with M (which we didn’t do until the Sunday following this MD due to their wild schedule - we take turns paying and it usually comes out between $70-$120 depending on where we go and how many drinks we have). The alcohol purchase is not a typical habit, the clothes purchase is very atypical, and I waffled about counting the annual aquarium membership as a weekly expense. The movie, popcorn and baby fund donations were also atypical. If all of those were subtracted this would be more of a usual week for me.

Rereading this drove home the fact that I am extremely burned out on my current job and something needs to change. On a happier note, I love how I’ve invited my art practice back into my life, and it’s scary, but I’m starting to wonder if I could make something of it. I got badly burned the one time in my life I tried to pursue a creative career in 2018 right after graduation, and I haven’t messed around with trying to make money off my art since then. Also, it didn’t come up in this diary because they were at work or sleeping or we were talking about other things, but M is so supportive of my art and my desire to teach someday after they’re done with residency and I’m so lucky to have a wonderful life companion like them. I’m excited to get engaged and start wedding planning in 2026, especially with the news of the Supreme Court decision today putting my heart at ease! This diary also made me appreciate how beautiful our life in Baltimore is and how happy I am that I moved up here, and made me want to consider retroactively posting my moving diary if people are interested.

If you made it all the way through, thanks for reading and I hope you were at least moderately entertained! ",9,1762826401.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,2,0.8,False
1otx24d,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/1otx24d/trying_to_get_ibd_diagnosis_any_advice/,"Trying to get IBD Diagnosis, any advice??","I’ve had stomach issues for as long as I remember. When I turned 22 I decided to take charge and go to the GI. It started with all the tests. Calprotectin( negative) ,tTg (negative) colonoscopy( looked normal and found 2 ssa’s) endoscopy ( chronic gastritis- h. Pylori neg,esophagitis, and non reactive gastropathy) and yet no answers for my stomach problems. Tried and failed 4 different medications used to treat ibs. This was nov of 2024. After this I was willing to give up for now. My symptoms are abdominal pain every day , burning sensation in my lower stomach with occasional nausea,constant bloating and diarrhea at least 5-6 times a day, have found mucus in my stool as well have had several urgencies a day where I feel like I’m going to go in my pants . I don’t digest leafy greens or tomatoes like at all like have found whole pieces in my diarrhea and pretty much just literally uncomfortable every day of my life from all of this . Fast forward to September of this year I went on a weekend getaway trip. In the middle of nowhere I had the worst abdominal pain, my stomach was gurgling so loud I was literally about to sh*t myself I could literally feel it moving down my intestines and I was in so much pain I had tears in my eyes and was white knuckling my seat . I made my boyfriend pull over and I went on the side of the road with traffic passing me by cause I did not care at the time( not my finest moment with him, he was a trooper tho) Because of this I decided to go back to my GI. They did a crp test ( a month later) and it was mildly elevated so they did a ct w contrast( another month later )It came back that there was some mild wall thinking in my splenic flexure and sigmoid colon. I asked my GI what that meant and they said it was prolly just from the ct scan. I was so upset. I thought after a year and a half I was finally starting to get answers and expressed that to them. They ordered another calprotectin( another month later )  and said if it came back elevated they would do another colonoscopy. Got my results back today and they were exactly the same as they were a year and a half ago. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m too young to be dealing with this stuff with nothing being wrong and haven’t been able to get any answers. I eat pretty healthy, a lot of gluten free things. Cut coffee from my daily routine overall a generally healthy person. Anyone else been thru this with GI? Idk what to do but I know I cannot keep living like this. ",1,1762826384.0,IBD,5,1.0,False

I’m building a local startup idea called **Kanari ""Quiet Booth""** — small, soundproof booths inside coffee shops where people can take video calls, interviews, or just focus quietly while still enjoying their coffee.

Before launching, I’m doing some quick **research with people who actually work or study from cafés in Saskatoon.**

If that sounds like you, please take a quick **1-minute survey** 

👉 [https://okt11ij1rel.typeform.com/to/pPZqcrTP](https://okt11ij1rel.typeform.com/to/pPZqcrTP)

As a thank-you:  
💡 *Everyone who fills it out will receive one free* **Kanari ""Quiet Booth""** *session once we launch our first location in Saskatoon.*

We’re collecting honest feedback — what you’d want inside the booth, how often you’d use it, and what pricing feels fair.  
Your answers will directly shape how we design and price the first cabins and help local cafés decide to host them.

Thanks so much for supporting a small local startup idea! 🙌",0,1762826182.0,saskatoon,3,0.25,False

I’m excited to share that I’m building a women’s community called Bloom Co. We host free friendship-based events, like coffee meet-ups and walks, to help women reconnect offline.

I’ve drafted an idea for a circle model that includes both free and paid options. Here’s the rough structure:

**Two Free Circles:** Coffee Meet and Women’s Walk 🌸

**Paid Circles (Tier 2):** Book Club, Journaling Circle, and a “Pamper Me” self-care circle.

Each paid circle will be $18.97. This fee will cover a “Bloom Box” that women will receive at their meet, which includes themed take-home items, a letter from me, small gifts, and more.

Each circle will consist of an A & B group, with 10 women in each group, to create a more personal atmosphere.

My question is: should I introduce this model after the very first free event, or wait until the second event, when members are more connected and comfortable?

I would love feedback from anyone who has run community events, membership groups, or similar models. 🙏 Do you think this pricing and structure make sense, or does it feel too early to introduce tiers?",1,1762826098.0,Femalefounders,0,1.0,False

if i did this again, and i don't think i will, i might have gone in with ginger and garlic at the beginning or something.  have to say, though, it was a pretty high volume low calorie bowl of oatmeal since i also added wheat bran and some cabbage.  i'm not too intense about counting calories, but out of curiosity, i tried doing the math for this breakfast and then the whole day.  when i do count, i sort of go with a weight watchers thing that i don't know is still done or not, but it encourages you not to count vegetables or even fruit.  i may count it, but i underestimate on purpose.

so, breakdown of calories in [breakfast](https://imgur.com/ahF4qtd).  the oatmeal (160), wheat bran (35) and cabbage (zero) would be around 200 calories, two eggs would be about 150, the mushrooms and cucumber i don't count.  soya sauce is nothing, yogurt is around 100, i'll say 50 for the melon and since i've switched to 5% cream and monk fruit sweetener (my mom's cutting sugar because she's getting pre-diabetic so it's in the house already), the coffee's only going to be 20 calories max.  the whole breakfast comes to around 520.  for the size of it and how filling it was, that's not so bad. 

next, the calories in [lunch](https://imgur.com/tbef3Xm).  the flat breads i make are similar to [this recipe](https://cookingwithayeh.com/yogurt-flatbread/) so i'd count one as maybe 150. cream cheese is about two tablespoons so 70 calories.  salsa and hot sauce are negligible and the roasted vegetables had some oil and za'atar to cook so, i don't know, let's go all out and say 100 calories.  chocolate yogurt was another experiment i probably won't be doing again and i'd say maybe 120.  in total about 440 (450).

i could actually have done without [dinner](https://imgur.com/ohuO1U2) but thought that might be a bad idea.  about a cup of potato curry we can say 200 calories.  tomato chutney about 40.  jello is 10.  i also had another coffee, later on and not pictured which again i'd count as 20.  so 270 all together. 

it all adds up to about 1,250 calories and i am *full* right now, like FULL.  ",1,1762825820.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

I enjoyed writing by the window with my heater at my side and the snow at my back. Peach enjoyed it to. I hd to stop writing yet again for almost an hour so she could take a nap on my lap. Every time she does this I worry I won't have time to write at all but soon enough I managed to convince her to move to the chair beside me.

The actual plot of this part of the story is taking longer than I'd like to get through. Maybe I am slow or maybe this part will need a rewrite. Either way that is the future author's problem. All I need to concern myself is getting the first draft down. If I continue to struggle so much with it, maybe I'll take a break from it and work on another story for a few days. A change of pace helps; a glass of water after nothing but soda for days. I have plenty of options to sip on until my palate cleanses.

I don't have much else to tell you. Father's keys are still missing. My shoulder is no better than what has become usual. I also had a strange coughing fit one night when I was in the middle of sleeping, I can't even remember which night or whether it really happen or was simply a dream. Maybe I'm coming down with something. I desperately hope not. I'm behind on my writing enough as it is. Maybe I'll start using my air purifier when I sleep again and see if that helps. I used it most during last winter, when the heating system made the air so dry I'd get a bloody nose every day. Drinking more water also couldn't hurt.

I worked as an administrative assistant in the h.q. of a coffee company for about two years. On Sep 19th I was called into a meeting in the middle of my shift and terminated. They did not accuse me of any misconduct or of poor performance. I was specifically told “this isn’t working out” and to leave the premises. I was also told that I would be receiving one week of severance pay for the following week in appreciation of my loyalty to the company. On Sept 22nd I sent an email to my bosses  accepting the severance pay as the conditions of my termination. They did not respond to the email but they did send the severance pay at the correct time, exactly as described in the email. I filed for unemployment once I received the severance pay which was on Oct 3rd. My former employer is now claiming that I “voluntarily quit” and I was denied benefits because of this. I requested a hearing and sent and evidence packet along with my request including the email accepting the conditions of my termination and the paystub showing that I was paid for the following week when I was no longer employed as my severance pay exactly as we agreed upon. I spoke with the claims center and they stated that it is likely that I will get a redetermination given the strength of the evidence they I was terminated through no fault of my own. I was wondering if there is anyone I can speak to in order to expedite the process since it has been a long time now and I am experiencing financial hardship. Does anyone have any experience in getting a redetermination in your favor or in ways to expedite the hearing process ? Any type of feedback is greatly appreciated.

The rest of the stories can be found on this [masterpost](https://old.reddit.com/r/AstroRideWrites/comments/mgv92s/mieran_ruins_collection).*

Housing after the apocalypse went through several stages. The first stage was the original inhabitants got vaporized, which means this property is mine now. The second step was about challenging each other to open combat to see who could hold onto what they had. The third stage was realizing that all the buildings were garbage, and it didn’t matter who owned what. Property disputes were resolved by both sides passive aggressively saying the other should keep the house. After all, it was in such a lovely location, and the neighborhood was coming up.

Dorothy obtained her house after the Mieran Invasion. It was a lovely four bedroom in what could be described as a feeble attempt at the Tudor style. She always desired it even when she was a little girl. When the war ended, she saw her chance and took it. Coincidentally, the owners disappeared that same day. It was during a lull in violence in general, and the original occupant’s bodies were never found. Funny how that happened. She managed to defend it against all invaders, and was determined to die there. 

Jacob approached the door wearing his nicest shirt which meant the a shirt with a collar and two buttons. He had a gift consisting of flowers. He considered getting a box of chocolate, but the local candy maker had recently disappeared. His house was now occupied by a young couple looking to make it their forever home. It was funny how that kept happening. Perhaps humanity wasn’t as advanced as they thought. Jacob knocked on the door and waited.
Franklin opened the door wearing his nicest shirt which meant his shirt which had the least amount of holes. His hair was dripping wet and parted to the right. His face was bright red, and his smile was forced.

“Aww, those look beautiful.” Franklin took the flowers and gave Jacob a quick peck. “I was thinking that maybe we could go to that new restaurant that opened down the street. I heard they serve excellent french fries.”


“I thought we’d eat here,” Jacob said.

“I said that, but it’s my mother,” Franklin said.

“Don’t blame me if he can’t handle it.” Dorothy pushed her son out of the way and threw the door open. “Here, what do you think?”

The mess inside was so thorough that it appeared to be the result of deliberate effort rather than mere neglect. The walls were covered with marks and smelled horribly. The floor was home to garbage and miscellaneous items that were supposed to be stored somewhere else permanently, but she never got around to it. Through the hallway, Jacob could see the kitchen table where a vase sat. The flowers died long ago, and the water turned brown. A new form of life was sprouting from their corpse, and if biologists ever found it, it would shatter all their current knowledge about life and evolution.

“It’s very…” Jacob struggled to look for the right word. That was the power of the word very. In theory, it implied an abundance of certain qualities. In practice, it was a filler word until the most flattering term could be found. “Homely.” 


If Dorothy was more social, she’d realize that calling something homely meant the inhabitant didn’t care at all about their basic hygiene. Alas, if she did realize it, she didn’t care. She fought hard for this house, and she was going to use it as she pleased.

“What did you plan on cooking here?” Jacob sweated as he imagined all the foodborne illnesses entering his body.

“I was going to fry some fish,” Franklin said.

“You still can. The fire’s going strong in the living room,” Dorothy said. 

“Fire.” Jacob was confused by this comment. Dorothy smirked and led him in. The stove was covered with dirty dishes because the sink was filled with old papers. For cooking, Dorothy had turned the coffee table in the living room into a makeshift fire pit. The fire was burning strong and smelled of manure.

“Oh lovely,” Jacob said.

“I agree. It’s always best to cook your own food,” Dorothy said.

“Well, get the fish I guess,” Jacob said.

Across town, the cleaning robot appeared on Sasha’s doorstop. She moved it to her room and turned it on. A loud buzzing noise emitted from the device, and its head extended.

“Abigail 1.0 set-up complete. Please contact the warranty office if any problems are discovered.” The robot had an accent that didn’t betray any regional origin, but it definitely sounded posher than you. The warranty office didn’t exist, but Dr. Kovac always enjoyed putting it in all his inventions as a joke. No one else found it funny.

“Would you like me to start cleaning?” Abigail asked. 

“Yeah.”

“Desire confirmed. Begin analysis.” A red light scanned the room. “Analysis complete. Cleanliness score 29. Standard teenage room.”

“Thanks,” Sasha said.

“Beginning cleaning.” The robot’s hands moved quickly. It picked up all her clothes and sorted them. The dirtiest clothes were placed in her quick washer inside her. The base of her body shampooed and dried the carpet. Miniature dusters emerged from her hands. Within three minutes, the room was spotless.

“Would you like me to continue?” Abigail asked.

“Sure, you did a great job,” Sasha said.

“Compliment accepted. Thank you.” Abigail wheeled out of the room to continue her journey. Dr. Kovac forgot to program it to continuously confirm that it needed to clean. Sasha didn’t know, but it was now on a journey to achieve perfect hygiene. The consequences would soon be apparent, but that was someone else’s problem. For now, Sasha could sit in her room and enjoy the fact that the chores were done.

New peater here. I've been suffering for years from long term fungal/mold problems and have been unable to function for whatever reason. I initially transitioned to carnivore and it helped heal me dramatically and improved a lot but at some point, the spark disappeared. I then found out about MTHFR and tried B vitamins and same thing happened. Miraculous beginning and spark disappeared.

After being exposed to Peating from X/Twitter.... The only thing I've implemented was coffee in the mornings and eating random teaspoons of raw honey throughout the day, and drinking raw honey with milk before bed.

With only these 3 minor changes... I've seen a dramatic turnaround in my MOOD, PRODUCTIVITY, MOTIVATION, ENERGY, and SLEEP QUALITY.

I just want to say fucking thank you because you guys have saved me from spiraling into a pit of doom... (I was seriously at risk of dropping the ball on many important life responsibilities from inability to function).

Thank you.

Side note: would be interested to learn if this WOE (way of eating) will lead to better immune/gut function to heal my mold toxicity issues. Any tips are appreciated.",3,1762824617.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

The alarm goes off at 6:00 as usual. It’s Thursday, with no work Friday it’s almost the weekend. Amy stretches and tries to put together a game plan. Two hour drive for 10:30 meeting. Out by noon then in the office at 3:30. Tie up some loose ends then a busy three day weekend. Time to take a quick shower, alone.  But in twelve hours she will be where she wants to be.

The alarm sounds at 6:06. Dan was already awake. Marveling at how empty the house feels. Starts the coffee wonders back to the bedroom. Well at least it smells like Amy. Wyatt called yesterday and wanted to talk this morning. Have to talk to Charlie and make another call he never thought he would ever make again. 6:30 the phone rings.

“Good morning Beautiful. How did you sleep?” Thinking he already knew the answer. 

“It was great! There wasn’t a boner poking me in the ass all night!”

That comment made Dan laugh. “Talked to Larry after your presentation. Said that you owned it.”

“Had a wonderful supper with Larry and Tamera last night. Tamera played 20 questions on me pretty hard early. Then we went to the ladies room to wash and she apologized. She had to make sure I wasn’t a gold digger.  We are invited for a weekend at the lake house.  I’m not sure we’re fancy enough for a lake house!”

“Did he say anything about increasing their orders?”

“No. What? Wait. Why?” Amy stutters. 

Dan laughs. “It has to be negotiated but you got us in the front door. You better get going don’t want to be late. I love you and good job Baby Girl.”

Dan gets his coffee and goes gets Rosie. She comes trotting out of the kennel with an old toy of Chief’s. She was very proud of herself. The only time she would drop the toy was to chase a bunny. Side by side rides were still both of their favorite. 

XOXOXOXOXOXO

Dan was working in his office when there was a knock on the door and in walked Wyatt. He walks in and sits in a chair across from Dan. He sat there dirty, needing a shave and haircut. Boots covered with mud, concrete and paint. What other people wouldn’t know is he walked out of the house probably at 5:00 this morning and just left the job site fifteen minutes ago. Working beside his guys and keeping all the balls in the air. Wyatt was one that wanted to make it on his own and he had. 

“So how’s Amy, Dad?” There was no sarcasm, just a genuine question. 

“First solo business trip. Went and saw Larry yesterday.”

“Hope it went better than Rachel’s first visit with him.” They both laughed. Glad Rachel wasn’t there to hear them. 

“She aced it. Sounds like more business coming our way.”

“Last night Katie went on and on about Amy liking yellow kitties and having another princess dress.”

Dan, sits and smiles. 

“I have business to discuss with you.” Wyatt says. “I’ve got a chance to sell the company, for way more than it’s worth. So I would need a job. You always said there would be a place here for any of us. So I’m calling in a favor if I sell. I would need a job.”

Dan gets up and walks across the room. Goes to the liquor cabinet and reaches in the back. Pulls out a bottle of the good stuff. Pours two glasses. Hands one to Wyatt and sits down. 

“Cheers!” Dan smiles and sips. “Does Jade know?”

“Not yet, but she wants me home more. I know I’d have to start here at the bottom”

“Listen to me, you have skills. You built a business from scratch. You never find that type of experience. You have something I can’t buy. You will be an asset.”

“Thanks Dad.”

“Now listen to this old fart. Go home and talk to Jade. Get a babysitter for tonight and put on your suit and take her out. Go get a haircut and shave for Christs sake. Jade has worked just as hard as you making this happen.”

Wyatt knew that was sound advice. He got up, finished his drink. Shook Dan’s hand and headed to the door. “Do I have to wear a suit?”

“Yes. Take it from a 60 year old guy banging a 30 year old hottie.”

“Damn it Dad! Now I’ve got to get that image out of my head!”

Both laugh as Wyatt heads out. 

Dan goes back and grabs the bottle of bourbon and two fresh glasses. He walks down the hall, knocks on the door and walks in. Sets the glasses down on Charlie’s desk and pours them each a shot. He sits down in the leather chair. 

“What’s the special occasion? Amy get us another chunk of business?”

“Better.” Takes a sip of bourbon. “Wyatt is ready to join the business. We have our new manager.”

Charlie grabs his glass and leans back in his chair. “You are the luckiest son of a bitch I know!”

XOXOXOXOXO

Amy walks out of the board room. Tim followed, “I’m sorry you had to deal with all of them.”

“It’s alright. A lot of people are worried right now. They know it will get better it’s just when.”

“On top of it we have some minority ownership that is making rumblings about wanting their money.” Tim shakes his head. 

“So how are the books?”

“Excellent but can’t afford to buy out 20 or 25%  of the company in cash.”

“How is your capacity?”

“Only 10 to 15% under optimal.”

“Give Dan a call. I know there are a couple things on our end that we could use some help on. You never know.”

Tim looked like the world was lifted off his shoulders. “I will.”

“Dan said your one of the good ones. He said you guys are a top notch company.”

With that she walks out and gets in the Jeep. ‘Momma warned me there would be days like this.’ She heads out. She drives by a couple cute boutiques and goes around the block. After that a little retail therapy is required. 

XOXOXOXO

Amy pulls into a travel center grabs the bag of new clothes and heads inside. She goes in a stall and strips off the pantsuit she was wearing. Then put on this cute little baby doll sundress she had bought. It was to short and to low cut but she looked so cute in it. She slips on a pair of pantyhose. She hated  these things but knew it would make Dan’s brain melt. ‘What is it about men and pantyhose?’ She wonders half out loud. She slips on her heels and walks out. She catches a glimpse of herself. “Well I won’t ever be able to wear this to church!” Buys a sparkling water and gets on the road. She sends Dan a text:

Be at the office in 30.

Hits send and gets on the road. A minute later Dan’s reply:

See you soon BG. Have good news. Drive safe. 

Amy pulls into the parking lot. Slips on the wedge heels that Dan had mentioned he liked. She smiles and says to herself “having a man with a clothes fetish is kind of fun.” The parking lot is empty so she walks right in and goes right into Dan’s office. He is on the phone with his back to her.  She adjusts the top to show more cleavage. The clears her throat. Dan turns around with a finger to his mouth to request that she be quiet. Then he sees Amy. He just stands there. Doesn’t talk doesn’t move. Slowly he puts the phone to his ear. 

“Tim, Amy just walked in and there is something I need to take care of, we will talk tomorrow.” Then hangs up. Dan tries to talk.  His mouth moves trying to make words. Amy giggles at her poor speechless Silver Fox. 

She does a little spin. “I got you something Daddy. Do you like it?” She asks in full tease mode. 

Dan knows he is being teased. This beautiful woman who is stealing his heart and made him millions of dollars in the last 24 hours and doesn’t know it.  She wants him to want her. Slowly Dan can think straight again. “I’m glad you stopped by. We are going to Toni’s for supper.”

Amy was stunned. This dress, this whole outfit was supposed to be for his eyes only. This baby doll sundress barely covers anything. Her nipples began to harden at the thought of being this exposed in public. “Daddy this was supposed to be for your eye’s only. I don’t know if I can do this!” 

“Baby Girl, you look gorgeous. Please do me the honor of taking you to dinner to celebrate.”

“The dress, is it to much?” I can change. 

Dan smiles “I’m okay with it if you are.”  

“But what will people think when they see us together?”

Dan smirks, Amy knows he is going to try and embarrass her. “They are going to think that I either have a lot of money or a big dick. After your trip, they are right on both counts!” Amy just shakes her head. 

“I’m not going to give you the satisfaction of laughing!” They head out the door to go celebrate together. 

They get in Amy’s vehicle. “I need to go do chores and change before we go get dinner. Plus you can meet Rosie.” Dan says. “ I was at a lost for words earlier. You my dear look incredibly sexy.”

“I needed a little retail therapy after happened at Tim’s company.”

“I heard it got pretty nasty. Although I also heard you kept your wits about you and capitalized on an opportunity. Well done young lady.”

Amy can’t help but blush a little. “Thank you. That means a lot.”

“You planted seeds that are already starting to take root. I can’t say any more.”

He didn’t have to. She knew that she might have lost the battle but won the day. 

When they got to the farm, first thing they did was go meet Rosie. It was love at first sight for both of them. They bonded while Dan went to change. Rosie went to chore and Amy slipped inside. 

Amy went to the bedroom and found the toy stash. “Let’s see if we can make tonight a little more interesting.” She grabs a butt plug and lube. 

In a few minutes Dan can comes in the house. He quickly starts shedding clothes and heads to the shower, Amy follows. Stepping into the steamy shower, Amy is staring and smiling. 

Seeing the look in her eyes of desire, Dan says “Why don’t you take a picture it will last longer.” So she does. 

“Do you like my new dress Daddy?” Amy smiles. “You don’t have to answer that. I can see by your cock you do. I don’t think you’ll make it through dinner without some relief first.”

Dan knows she is right. “You going to do something about it?” Dan asks. 

“No. I’m not, but you are.  Now stroke your cock for me Daddy. I want to watch you pleasure yourself while I stand here and take a few pictures and watch.” Amy can’t believe those words are coming out of her mouth as he slowly starts to stroke his erection. “Now soap yourself up so your nice and slick. That’s what I want to see. Now cup your balls with your left hand and keep stroking.”

Dan does as instructed. He knows where this is going and doesn’t care. 

“Did you know Daddy, I forgot to put my panties on before putting on these pantyhose. Do you like my pantyhose?”

“Yes, Baby Girl!”

“Keep stroking Daddy, but don’t cum till I tell you! Do you want to see my kitty?”

“Yes please.” He moans softly. 

“Don’t cum yet! As she steps forward, and pulls up the skirt. Revealing her nylon clad pussy. 

“May I cum please?” Dan begs.

“No! What are you going to this beautiful kitty tonight?”

“Make it mine!” Dan moans.

“Cum for me Daddy! Like a good slut!”

“Oh Fuck! Baby Girl!”

Three ropes shoot out across the shower. Dan slumps against the wall. Amy standing there enjoying the sight of her man completely losing it at her command. She wiggles her finger at him to come close. She gentle kisses him. “Now hurry up, I’m starting to get hungry.”

Dan stands up and smiles. “Yes dear!”

“Oh and Daddy.” Amy smiles. “Turn about is fair play!”

Digital Marketing.,"A few years ago, I was stuck in a windowless office, inputting data into spreadsheets for eight hours a day. My soul was practically withering under the fluorescent lights. The highlight of my day was timing my coffee break just right. I felt like a background character in my own life, just watching the clock tick down to retirement.

One night, mindlessly scrolling, I saw an ad for a digital marketing course. I'd heard the term but pictured slick, corporate types in suits. Out of sheer desperation, I clicked. Suddenly, I was deep in a rabbit hole of SEO, Google Ads, and social media funnels. It felt like learning a new language, but for the first time in forever, my brain actually felt… excited. I spent my nights and weekends devouring every free tutorial and cheap online course I could find.

My first 'client' was a friend's struggling Etsy shop that sold handmade candles. I built them a simple Instagram campaign, targeting people who liked cozy home decor. When my friend called me, ecstatic, because she’d made more sales in a weekend than she usually did in a month, it was a bigger thrill than any promotion I’d ever gotten. That little taste of success was all I needed. I started freelancing on the side, taking on any project I could to build a portfolio.

Fast forward to today: I run my own small agency from my home office (which has a window!). I make three times what I did at my old job, I set my own hours, and that feeling of dread on a Sunday night is completely gone. It wasn't an overnight thing, and there was a ton of grinding and moments of doubt, but making that leap was the best decision I ever made. It’s not just about the money; it’s about feeling like I’m actually building something real.

So, for anyone feeling stuck like I was, what's a skill you've considered learning on the side that could be your 'escape hatch'?",1,1762824381.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

This past weekend I had a same-gender client who talked the entire session, and I could relate to much of what she said so I was commiserating a bit. Specifically, she was talking about how hard it is to make authentic connections with people and I agreed with that. At the end of our session she declared that we should meet for coffee sometime soon because apparently she felt like we connected authentically. I was taken aback because it felt sudden, and honestly I'm not looking to make friends out of my clients, but I didn't know what to do in the moment so I smiled and said that would be nice. 

Later when she was checking out, I went up to get my next client and she said she had given the front desk permission to give me her cell and to get in touch. And I said I would, because what else could I say? 🤦‍♀️

I have to be honest that in addition to the ethical/boundary considerations, this behavior felt like a red flag (or at least yellow) to me -- but I know I also contributed to this because we're on the same page about many topics. I've already internalized the lesson that I need to be careful empathizing with clients during a session, and I would love to take that lesson and move on, but she's already booked another session with me next month and I feel like I should at least get back to her -- even if it's to say something like I'm too busy to meet for coffee. (It's true that with massage school and working FT, I am honestly too busy, but a part of me feels obligated. The other part of me wants to run because something just feels off about the way this all went down.)

What would you do? What are the ethics around this kind of thing, where someone wants to connect outside of this setting? Should I be polite and text her but let her know my time is super limited? I'm trying to tell myself it's no big deal, just text her to be polite, but something in my gut is stopping me. Help!!

After the last one I parked my truck near a hospital walked over checked myself in, did all the standard tests and everything was fine except my heart rate.

I also did blood work and wore a heart monitor for a day results came back perfect.

1otw3fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1otw3fm/what_do_you_think_happened_to_me_in_my_old/,What do you think happened to me in my old apartment?,"This happened to me on Halloween night of 2018 and has haunted me ever since that night. My girlfriend and I were renting a two bedroom apartment at the time, this apartment had an upstairs and a downstairs. I spent most of my time downstairs as that's were my computer set up was. The upstairs had a bathroom, our bedroom and the second bed room which my girlfriend turned into a room were she would store her clothes, do her makeup and had a fold out futon for when we had people over. We were not allowed to smoke in the apartment but I was a pot head so I just always opened the window in the second bedroom and smoked in there. I would like to preface that I had been smoking pot for well over ten years at the time of this incident and had what most would consider a high tolerance so me smoking weed didn't cause me to feel out of the ordinary, if anything it made me feel normal.

My girlfriend at the time worked night shifts at a restaurant so I was always home alone during the nights until around 10pm on most nights. I had just finished up my shift earlier in the night and came home to relax in my normal way, Smoke a joint and scroll on my phone while hanging with my dog in the second bedroom than go downstairs to play my computer down in the computer space. This must of been around 6 or 6:30pm so it had just gotten dark here on the east coast. I light up the joint and I smoked about half of it while spacing out endlessly scrolling Instagram on my phone while I had my dog sitting next to me with the window cracked.

All of a sudden I realize that my dog has been barking for about 20 seconds and has not stopped so that got me to lose focus on the phone and to what he was barking at. Directly in-front of me is the three drawer dresser with six drop handles on it that my girlfriend stored some of her clothes in.

When I looked up the top right handle was flapping up and down COMPLETELY on its own, I was in auto-pilot mode at this point so I got up and grabbed the handle to make it stop..When I did this my entire body went ice cold like I was in a freezer..at the exact moment everything clicked in my head and I realized what was going on. I let go of the handle and the moment I do..The handle starts flapping up and down again on its own, not rapidly but in a very rhythmic motion.

I could not bolt downstairs quick enough, I went into fight or flight mode and choose flight, when I got downstairs I realized my dog was still upstairs in the second bedroom barking at this dresser so with all my courage I went back up to grab my boy. When I get to the top of the stairs I see the handle is STILL flapping up and down. I run in, grab my dog and bolt downstairs in complete shock with everything that just happened.

I went into the living room and instantly called my friend to tell him what happened, just being on the phone with someone else made me feel secure, though I was still so scared. We must of been on the phone for hours until my girlfriend got home and I was able to tell her what happened up there..I was so scared to go back into that room from that moment on, though I still had to smoke in there. I would rush back down there the second I was done and ALWAYS kept the door shut so I didn't have to look in there when it was not needed. Our bedroom was next to this room so at night I would need to walk past it quite frequently.

A few days later I was talking to my neighbor who use to live in the apartment we were renting and asked if anything strange ever happened in there while she was renting it as she lived in there for over ten years. She told me in the room upstairs a young Lady had overdosed in the early 2000's. She also told me that her sister was sick at one point and was staying with her, until she passed away down stairs one day.

I only had a few other strange things happen to me in that apartment like my coffee mug sliding across the table about a foot or so while half full, but the dresser situation stuck with me since that day. Ive tried to make a rational explanation for that night but I simply can't. Things like having the window open..but there was no breeze, and even if there was why only the top right handle move? Why did my dog notice this before I did ? why did my body go ice cold.

I wish I had got this moment on film but in the moment that was literally the last thing on my mind. My girlfriend and I were so scared she ordered some sage and made us perform a seance. We put salt on all the windows, had them open and told whatever was in that apartment to leave and that it was our home now.

I will never forget what happened to me that night and it completely shattered what I thought reality was, I was always a believer but that just cemented it for me.",3,1762823725.0,Ghosts,0,0.64,False

If anyone has tips or advice on how to get my appetite back I'd really appreciate it.


Hey guys, first time even posting anything regarding this, i never looked at it like an issue because i didn't notice.

I'm 32M soon to be 33, 1 meter 91cm tall and i weigh around 66 kilos give or take half a kilo. All the doctor's Ive seen say i should be weighing around 85-90 kilos to be proportionate to my height. (I'm underweight)

For context, I'm an addict in recovery. I spent from age 15 to age 26 abusing hard drugs, heroin, speedballs, IV cocaine and crack (first experimenting then using on a regular / daily basis starting from about age 18 onward)

Since i spent so many years using cocaine i hardly ever ate, and at my worst before rehab i weighed like 50 kilos maybe less. 

My issue is that i straight up dont feel hungry. I used to eat all the time before starting to use coke and it's various methods of consumption. Back in active addiction i would go 1 week and eat the equivalent of 2 or 3 plates of food per week. Week after week, year after year.

So flash forward to today, Ive been clean from all hard drugs since Dec 8 2019 and i have definitely gained weight and organized my life to the point where i have a 9-5 job, wife and 2 kids so with i'm lucky that with the married and kids life, comes routine meals. My issue is i have no appetite, and don't really feel hungry until i'm like starving, and that just feels like nausea but i know it's hunger.

I realize that i have an eating disorder and this never crossed my mind but it's obvious because i don't eat 3 full meals a day, usually it's just 2 meals on a steady basis:

 - Eggs, toast, and coffee for breakfast

 - A lunchtine meal, my wife cooks for us and does an amazing job with variation and cooks delicious food (so it's not like the food bores me, it's not that)

I'm no doctor but i imagine that after almost a decade of the lifestyle i used to live, maybe my stomach shrunk? I definitely can't eat the same amount of food in one sitting as i used to pre-drugs.

Sorry for the long post i just wanted to know if anyone is in a similar position, not drug related but more ""having difficulty gaining weight"" related.

I swear i just feel no hunger and sometimes im forcing myself to eat just because i know i have to. Anyway i would really appreciate any thoughts, advice, stories, or anything that might help me get my appetite back. Thanks in advanced kind redditers!",0,1762823653.0,eating_disorders,2,0.5,False
