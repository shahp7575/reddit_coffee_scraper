Officer Philips: so we are targeting a known drug dealer who usually drives past here weekly, we’re going to do a standard pull over,  which will allow us to track his registration plate and so on, we will let him get on his way as we don’t want him to get too suspicious, and make up some crap about his plates being cloned in another province.

Nat’s nods along to officer Phillips, as they take a sip of the coffee.

Officer Phillips: there he is

Officer Phillips points a black 2006 ford fiesta

Officer Phillips: Alright nat’s let’s go get this muppet

The police car fly’s down the road with sirens blaring, as the Ford Fiesta tries to speed up but the driver realizes this isn’t going to be as clean as he likes, the Ford Fiesta, pulls over into another bylane on the road.

Driver: Is something wrong with the officer ?

Officer Phillips gathers the information and his reasons as a faint chemical smell can be smelt from the car's boot, nat’s and officer Phillips then open the boot and seizes several bags of fentanyl and methamphetamine, enough to harm thousands of Alberta residents.

Taking to social media after the bust, Nat’s said “What we saw tonight is exactly why Conservative governance in Alberta is failing. We need a member of parliament in Alberta North who can Challenge the ruling United Conservative Party and make them accountable for residents. Only the NDP will protect Albertans from the failures of the Tories.

1jl4ozj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MrGreenty/comments/1jl4ozj/how_overtrading_destroys_accounts_and_how_to_stop/,How Overtrading Destroys Accounts (And How to Stop),"Let’s drop the facade: You’re not “hustling” by making 20 trades a day. You’re **overtrading**, and it’s bleeding your account dry. After combing Reddit meltdowns, X rants, and desperate forum posts, here’s the cold truth: overtrading isn’t a strategy—it’s a self-inflicted wound. Let’s stitch it up.

# The Problem: You’re Addicted to the Click

**Real Traders, Real Pain**:

* Reddit user OvertradingOrphan: “Made 47 trades last week. Lost $3K. My broker loves me.”
* **X/Twitter @CaffeineChartGod**: *“I trade just to feel something. Even when the market’s closed.”*
* **Trade2Win Thread**: *“Overtrading is like scratching a mosquito bite. It feels good until it’s infected.”*

Newsflash: The market doesn’t care how many trades you make. It cares how many you *win*.

# Why You Can’t Stop (Even Though You Know You Should)

1. **FOMO on Steroids**: *“What if I miss the next NVIDIA?”* (You won’t. You’ll chase a pump-and-dump instead.)
2. **Boredom Trading**: Markets flat? You invent reasons to click “buy.”
3. **Ego Fuel**: *“I need to prove I’m right!”* → Spoiler: The market doesn’t grade effort.

**Pro tip**: If your trading log looks like a Netflix binge queue, you’re doing it wrong.

# The Reddit-Backed Fixes

# Step 1: Set a Trade Limit (And Stick to It)

* **Beginner Rule**: Max 3 trades/day. Period.
* **Advanced Rule**: 1 trade per 1 K in your account.. 1*K in your account*.. 5K? 5 trades. *No exceptions*.

# Step 2: Use the “Checklist” Hack

Before hitting “buy,” ask:

* ☑️ Does this fit my strategy?
* ☑️ Is the market in a clear trend?
* ☑️ Am I bored/angry/FOMO-ing?

**Fail one?** Walk. Away.

# Step 3: Track Your Triggers

* **Journal entries like**: *“Overtraded after 2 losses → revenge mode activated.”*
* **Patterns emerge**: You’ll spot if you trade more on Mondays, after coffee, or during full moons.

# The 3 AM Truth Bombs

* **More Trades ≠ More Edge**: The best setups are rare. Wait for them.
* **Your Broker is the Real Winner**: Fees and spreads feast on your hyperactivity.
* **Overtrading is a Symptom, Not the Disease**: Fix your boredom, FOMO, or ego—the trades will slow.

# The “Overtrading Detox” Challenge

1. **Week 1**: Cut your daily trades by 50%.
2. **Week 2**: Only trade 1 setup (e.g., morning momentum).
3. **Week 3**: No trades before 10 AM. Let the market wake up first.

**Reward**: Lower stress, clearer decisions. **Risk**: Realizing you’ve been paying your broker for therapy.

# The Unfiltered Verdict

Overtrading isn’t a badge of honor. It’s a neon sign screaming, *“I don’t trust my strategy!”* The traders who survive aren’t the busiest—they’re the *most patient*.

Your job isn’t to trade. It’s to wait.

**– Market Maven**  
*P.S. The best trader I know takes 2 trades a week. The worst one takes 2 trades a minute. Guess who’s on blood pressure meds?*",1,1743084371.0,u_MrGreenty,0,1.0,False

The suspect was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. so the game starts at the year 1981

You are Dylan Mchoney, a biological scientist working for a research company called Gaia, since previously you are famous for your recent discoveries of several groundbreaking research and new info about the dinosaurs, specifically your research for atrociraptors which compared to velociraptors are more robust and stronger, Gaia hired you to help them bring back the dino's back 

they have researched various  genus of dinosaurs from therapod to sauropods and ornithiscians

as well as aquatic reptiles, ancient fish and aquatic therapods, there are several Gaia facilities all around the world and you are stationed at Gaia facility D or Draia located in a Secret location of the state of Colorado USA, there you continue your research and eventually after a few years you and your colleagues succesfully bring back dinosaurs,all around the world other Gaia scientists have also brought back other prehistoric creatures meanwhile Gaia has congratualated you and others for your contribution and has prepared parties inside facilities for the scientists, these parties are only held at Gaia facilities and are hidden from the public as well as the recent success of bringing back the dinosaurs.

March 1980 Facility D, Gaia has hired a new research intern for you and your research her name is Mitchell Lockward, she has helped you through various research projects and has always been there for you, although she hides a very dark secret.   
Ms. Lockward or what you think her name is, is actually a journalist for the public who wants to know every secret Gaia has, her actual name is Livia Edmonds in which she did some illegal dealings to have her fake name forged with other documents concerning her background to pass through Gaia's background Checking and is now trying to get and record every bit of info she can get from your research.

September 27, 1991, over the past few years Gaia has successfully revived almost 67% every prehistoric creature there is with cutting edge technology, from the Early Triassic to Late Cenozoic period, over the course of the years your research for atrociraptors has been fruitful and has not gone unnoticed, same with other researches, all research involving theropod, sauropod and Prehistoric mammals have been given larger funding compared to other researches and to this day you are working as usual just like everyday Gaia has given every scientist Private Lodges Protected with outstanding security and you are not sure if you really need all that security since since your already in a over secured Facility.

September 27, 1991, 2:00 pm you are sitting by your desk on your break time usually you would have your assistant bring you coffee but she informed you that she would be going on a private matter with other assistants from other researchers, while you pay no attention to the matter you go up to get some coffee and maybe some food from the cafeteria, 2:30 pm after you grab some lunch you head back to continue some minor R&D on your research but while you do a sudden rumble shakes the facility and power goes down and red lights of alarm blare, the speaker deafens your ears as it says in the voice of facility director John Raigne ""all facility personnel please evacuate the area, it seems intruders have infiltrated the Reactor so Please follow your nearest security guard or officer to Evac zone, i have contacted Gaia and are sending an Armed emergency response team **he pauses**..... and Please stay away from the Containment areas for the specimens"", the speaker then shifts to an Ai voice saying evacuation guidelines, meanwhile you take all of your research files and put them in your special suitcase and go to your computer and transfer all of your research to Gaia Records, as you do Panicked screams and unearthly roars similar to atrociraptors  are heard on the hallway outside of your room, you hurry your work and as you are done you hear more screams and roars, you take a small peak and you see Velociraptors and some small compie's killing and eating your colleagues, **BANG** you see as your ear deafens multiple special security personnel have begun firing on the Creatures and are trying to rescue you and other researchers and some misc personnels, you run under the fire of the security team and as you do a velociraptor screeches and runs behind after you making it for the security hard to hit the monster rather than you, after some adrenaline panicked seconds a security officer shouts at you ""GET DOWN!"" you slide for the security to fire on the pursuer,\*BANG\* and with a accurate shot to the eye the Creature drops dead and the security team escort you and others to an emergency shelter. so uhhh im not done yet on the idea im kinda on a break of typing this i will update though.",1,1743084347.0,gameideas,0,1.0,False

1jl4obo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheRealARDaniel/comments/1jl4obo/creative_differences_chapter_1/,Creative Differences - Chapter 1,"https://preview.redd.it/le5m7oq1o8re1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=306d5f9b2fb0dfdc7e6e4dae008452b575abef10

Jamie Hollinsworth had always liked bookstores — the scent of fresh paper, the cozy lighting, the hidden promises of each story tucked neatly between cover and spine. But today, he felt none of the usual excitement. Today was different.

He nervously tapped his fingers on the polished wooden table of Greenlight Books Cafe, eyes glued to his laptop. An email stared back at him, one he’d been putting off opening. The sender: “*WordsmithAI*”

Jamie sighed and finally clicked open the email.

>“*Dear Mr. Hollinsworth,*

>*Congratulations! As one of our premium subscribers, your weekly novel is now ready. ‘The Lost Symphony,’ a gripping literary fiction exploring human struggle through music, awaits your personal touch. Happy editing!*

>*Best,*  
*The WordsmithAI Team”*

He grumbled audibly. Premium subscriber was a nice way of saying obsolete author. Every Monday morning, his inbox was cursed with another flawlessly written, fully formatted novel — no typos, no plot holes, impeccable pacing. All Jamie had to do was tweak sentences, shuffle around paragraphs, maybe inject a human flourish here or there to maintain plausible deniability.

But deep down, Jamie knew the truth: the machine had already done all the enjoyable work. And it did it disgustingly well.

He slumped into his chair, irritated at the beautiful prose in front of him, resenting the nuanced character development and intricate plots he himself struggled to craft. He wondered bitterly: when exactly did his own creativity become optional? Was he even still a writer if all he did was edit a robot’s work?

“Hey, Jamie!” a familiar voice interrupted his brooding. It was Priya, his longtime friend, and a programmer. She dropped her backpack onto the seat opposite, rubbing her temples dramatically.

“You look as thrilled about your morning as I feel,” she said dryly, sinking down.

“Your AI friend again?” Jamie asked knowingly.

Priya groaned loudly. “If by ‘friend,’ you mean that nightmare of corporate-mandated artificial intelligence that’s now coding better software than our entire dev team combined—then yes, absolutely. My good pal, CodeGenie.”

“Sounds awesome,” Jamie chuckled. “What did it gift you today?”

“Oh, just another fully complete, intricately architected application,” Priya deadpanned. “My ‘role,’ if I dare to call it that, is to debug the thing—except, surprise! It never has bugs! They just say ‘debug’ to make us feel necessary. We literally pretend to find problems, tweak a few settings, and voila—‘work complete.’ It’s insulting.”

Jamie nodded in solidarity. “Sounds familiar.”

They both paused, caught in their mutual misery and shared futility.

After a moment, Jamie's phone buzzed on the table. He glanced down and rolled his eyes, holding it up for Priya to see. It was a notification from his friend Tyler, a music producer he’d known since college.

“Guys, it happened. MelodiaAI composed my album again. I guess my job now is just clicking the ‘publish’ button and acting cool in interviews.”

“Poor Tyler,” Priya said with a grimace. “Is he still working with that major record label in the downtown studio complex?”

“Yeah, Harmony Records,” Jamie confirmed. “They were one of the first to fully adopt MelodiaAI. Tyler says his contract specifically limits how much he can modify the AI’s compositions—just enough tweaks to claim human involvement for copyright purposes.”

Priya leaned back, laughing sadly. “And here I thought art and creativity would be the last stronghold. Seems we’re all equally screwed.”

Jamie sighed, stirring his coffee absent-mindedly. “It used to be that creating was the fun part — the thrill, the anxiety, the doubt. But now, it’s all just... ready-made.”

A new voice cut in, playful and melodramatic. “What’s this? Is this the meeting of the Obsolete Artists Club?”

Both turned to see Marco Reyes approaching. Marco was their charismatic and perpetually upbeat friend, a graphic designer who had been producing viral album covers, book jackets, and digital art since before digital was cool.

“Marco,” Priya said, smiling tiredly. “Don’t tell me —“

“Oh yes!” Marco said, sitting dramatically and flourishing his tablet. “It’s Artify, my beloved corporate overlord, back with another masterpiece. Now my role is to add a subtle line or ‘personal touch’ somewhere, just enough to say I was involved. Artify even picks the colors! I’m essentially an overpriced human watermark.”

Marco scrolled through images on his screen, each one spectacular, breathtaking, and totally indistinguishable from anything Marco himself could have produced.

Jamie rubbed his forehead. “It feels like we’re living in some comedic dystopia. Our jobs are now literally just... approving a machine’s creativity.”

Marco laughed bitterly. “At least we’re in it together, right?”

Priya nodded slowly. “Together, yes. But to do what, exactly? Watch as we’re replaced, one conveniently automated masterpiece at a time?”

They sat quietly, sipping their coffee, lost in the absurdity of their situation. Marco broke the silence first, clearing his throat theatrically.

“Well, perhaps it’s time we humans made a stand — reclaim our territory, show these glorified calculators who’s boss. How about it?”

Jamie chuckled skeptically. “What, sabotage our digital overlords?”

Marco leaned forward conspiratorially, eyes glinting mischievously. “Oh no, something even crazier — let’s see what happens when we actually try doing it ourselves again.”

Jamie hesitated, strangely intrigued by Marco’s enthusiasm. “You mean write a novel? From scratch? Myself?”

Priya stared incredulously. “And actually code an entire app? Without CodeGenie’s ‘expert help’? My fingers have practically atrophied.”

Marco’s voice rose dramatically, earning amused glances from nearby patrons. “Exactly! We’ll prove creativity still needs the human spirit, the human struggle, the imperfection!”

Tyler’s voice chimed in through Jamie’s phone, amused. “Do I get to compose music again, with an actual instrument?”

“Of course!” Marco exclaimed. “And we should get Oliver involved too.”

“Oliver Bennet? The painter?” Jamie asked. “I haven’t seen him in months. Not since Artify started taking over his gallery shows.”

Marco nodded emphatically. “The very same. I ran into him at the Creative Technology Expo last week. He was doing the same thing we all are—adding tiny human touches to AI masterpieces. He’d love to join our rebellion.”

Jamie looked around the small table — Marco, grinning like a mad revolutionary; Priya, skeptical but already thoughtful; Tyler, laughing hopefully through the tiny speaker.

A flicker of excitement rose in Jamie’s chest, unexpectedly thrilling.

“Alright,” Jamie finally agreed, suddenly energized. “Let’s take back our joy.”

Marco clapped delightedly. “Viva la revolución !”

“I’ll start a group chat with all five of us tonight,” Priya offered, already pulling out her phone.

Jamie shook his head, smiling, then shut his laptop decisively. He’d deal with the perfect, robot-crafted novel later. For now, they were plotting something reckless, possibly futile, but undeniably human — and for the first time in months, he felt truly alive.

Their battle had begun.

1jl4ia8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/1jl4ia8/update_im_a_disappointment_to_the_firm/,UPDATE: I'm a disappointment to the firm,"It has been nearly two months since my original post.  I debated on posting an update, however, my previous firm posted a job posting the other day to fill my position.  I won't include the job posting or the stringent qualifications to work there (for doxing reasons), but it gave me a hell of a laugh.  You can also find the link to my initial post at the bottom.

Now for the update of events that followed that conversation.  After my conversation with my ex-boss, I instantly updated my resume and started reaching out to firms that same day.  I was extremely fortunate enough to meet up with a friend the next day.  He recommended me to his fellow partners, I sent them my resume, I interviewed, and I had accepted a new job at a larger and more successful personal injury firm not only in the city, but in the state, by the end of the week.  Like I mentioned, I felt fortunate that it panned out the way it did.  

So how did I tell my boss? I know a few commenters wanted an update for when I left, so here it is.  My intention was to give a month notice, mostly because I wanted to show my respect and I set my start date for the new job two months out to give me a little bit of a break between jobs. 

I separated from the firm on the Friday the week after I had the initial conversation with him.  Between the conversation and my departure, I did my best to prepare status memoranda, I showed up when he wanted me to, I worked both Saturday and Sunday (even though it wasn't necessary), and subtly packed belongings and took them home when I could.  Then, Thursday rolled around.  I showed up around 8 a.m. because I took my wife to work.  By the end of the work day, I decided to take a diploma home.  Friday morning, I showed up to work around 7:30 a.m.  Legit just brewed a cup of coffee and sat at my desk when my ex-boss comes into my office blood red.  The first words from his mouth are, ""How do you think you have been doing since our last conversation?""  I responded by saying that I thought I have been doing well, I have been showing up early, worked on the weekend, etc.  He disagreed.  He reiterated some things that he told me in our initial conversation and said that he noticed I came in with the staff yesterday, but not only that, I left with my diploma in front of the staff yesterday.  (To be fair, I did leave when the staff left at 5 p.m., but I was the only attorney left in the building anyway.)  He raised his voice and said he nearly called me at 8 p.m. last night to ask if I was quitting and he thought I wasn't going to show up today.  I responded by saying ""I am here... at 7:30 in the morning. Plus, I have never been a no-call, no-show.""  Then he asked why I took my diploma home, and I told him that I took his advice from our conversation and found a new job opportunity.  I mentioned that I will have status memoranda prepared and this is me giving a months notice.  A more than generous notice.  He didn't take it well.  In fact, I was told that I can pack my things today or someone can pack my things for me and I can pick them up on Monday.  So, I packed up all of my belongings and was gone by 7:45 a.m.  I had a solid relationship with the staff there, so I messaged them all and told them how much I appreciated working with them. 

After my abrupt departure, I contacted my new firm and moved my start date up by a month.  I took a month off and chilled out.  It truly was a much needed vacation from both law and life.  The difference between my previous firm and my current one is night and day.  Even in the interview for my new firm, I felt like it was the right fit, immediately.  Since I started there, it has been the best decision I have made in a long time.  The grass isn't always greener on the other side, but sometimes making the leap to find out is worth it.  In my case, I went from dead grass to a flourishing meadow. 

I can't say that I felt immediate relief when I left.  I felt sadness, depression, and instant feelings of insecurity about myself.  I had night terrors and couldn't sleep more than a few hours.  So much so that I had to go sit on the couch and start a show to fall back asleep for a little bit.  But, I got passed most of that after two or three weeks. Starting at the new firm has made me much happier.  I am extremely grateful for all of the support everyone in r/Lawyertalk has given me.  Everyone validated how I felt and helped me make that necessary change.  I can't say thank you enough.

If anyone ever falls into a situation similar to mine, please reach out to me.  I am happy to chat about how I handled things or to chat generally.

by c.w. cobblestone

I had just plopped into bed after yet another long, exhausting day of service when my cellphone pinged with a message from my master — three little words that set my sissy heart aflutter:

*get in here*

Tingling with excitement, I rolled out of bed, hurriedly donned my pink teddy — one of Cody’s favorites — and fixed my makeup. When I was presentable, I scurried across the corridor to the master suite and tapped on the door.

Liz granted permission to enter. I greeted the naked, reclining couple with two respectful curtseys.

“Mistress? Master? How may I serve you?”

Liz wiggled her butt on the mattress and spread her legs. “Come get me ready for your master.”

“Oh, oh — thank you, Mistress!” I slipped onto the bed and situated myself between Liz’s thighs beneath her swollen belly, waiting until she tapped my ear, her unspoken command to start licking.

Cody soul-kissed his lady and rubbed her baby bump while I worshiped her divine vagina and peeked up at my betters in awe. I no longer wished I could be a real man like my master; that ship had long since sailed. Rather, a submissive wave washed over me whenever his sexual prowess was on display, and my master was the object of my fawning admiration instead of the bitter envy I’d once felt. Being a eunuch kept me from having delusions of grandeur, and helped me realize that I wasn’t even close to being a man like my master — and, despite my operations that gave me a feminine appearance, I’d never be a woman, either. I was a sissy, whose job was to serve, serve, serve.

That fact had caused me much anguish when we’d first embarked on our adventure, although after my spiritual awakening, I became content with my place in the sun, even if it was on society’s bottom rung. Accepting that everyone was better than me went a long way toward achieving inner harmony.

I deduced that Liz was enjoying my tongue, since she moaned and grabbed my hair. The gesture made me smile inside, and I put my heart and soul into my work until I was abruptly shoved aside by my horny master.

Cody slid his fat cock into Mistress’s wet pussy, making her throw back her head and suck in a lungful of air. As he built up a rhythm, my master barked over his shoulder: “Get that tongue going.”

“Yes, Master, thank you, Master!” I gushed before pressing my nose into his bucking buttocks and probing until I tasted his spicy O-ring.

“Mm,” he groaned as he increased his pace, causing my head to jerk back and forth with each thrust. It was hell on my neck muscles, and my nose took a beating, but I didn’t care — I was happy to be of service.

Without warning, Master rolled over with his dick still inside Liz, until she was on top of him. Since I’d been trained to keep my tongue where it belonged until told otherwise, my head got smushed between his ass and the mattress. I tried to stay still and submissive while the amorous couple fucked cowboy-style, although when it became difficult to breathe with the weight of two bodies suffocating me, I involuntarily started squirming, which caused my betters to chuckle.

“Sorry about that, sissy; I forgot you were under there,” Master said in an amused tone as he lifted his hips enough for me to extract myself from beneath their sweaty torsos.

My mistress giggled as I choked and sputtered in an attempt to catch my breath. Cody smacked her on the ass.

“Ooh, I can feel your pussy squeezing my dick every time you laugh,” he said — and just like that, my mistress forgot all about me. She playfully squeezed her vaginal muscles on her lover’s cock, making him groan with pleasure, before bopping up and down again.

I curled up at the foot of the bed and watched the divine coupling, awash in wonder, hoping my mistress might order me to suck her toes or lick her butthole, even though I knew the latter would result in my neck becoming even sorer. Or, perhaps, I thought, my master might want his toes sucked. Whatever secondary sexual service was required, I was ready and eager to provide it with a submissive smile on my Botox-swollen, ruby red lips.

Alas, Liz and Cody were lost in each other, and they made sweet love without giving a thought to the sissy eunuch at their feet.

When Master blew his load, it was further proof that he was far, far above me on the food chain, since I no longer knew the joy of orgasms. Being a prime stud, Cody continued fucking my mistress after he came until she climaxed, too, screaming like a banshee with her nails scratching his back and her toes curling.

In the postcoital calm, Cody had me suck his slimy penis clean as usual, although my mistress called for a towel as she generally did after having an orgasm, when she was too sensitive to be licked “down there.”

As I sucked my master’s cock, he conversed with his wife about the next day’s plans.

“I’ve got a group from Chicago coming in to do some fishing tomorrow, and they said they needed a guide, so I might be a little late,” Cody said, rubbing his fingers in my hair while I slurped a bead of cum from his balls. “Depends how long they want to stay out; they said they were coming at one, so I shouldn’t be too late — those city groups don’t usually stay out too long.”

“I might be late too; I’ve got a meeting with our attorneys at three, and those assholes love to hear themselves talk.” Liz nudged me with her foot. “Are my red pumps shined, Mirabella?”

I lifted my mouth from Master’s cock. “Yes, Mistress, I did them right after dinner like you told me to, Mistress.”

Liz nodded regally and continued talking to her husband while I got back to work. I was summarily dismissed after Cody’s genitals were deemed clean, and I thanked my masters for the honor of serving them before exiting their suite. They didn’t bother answering, which was par for the course.

After years of having a sissy maid at their disposal, my masters rarely teased me or gratuitously humiliated me like they had in the early days of our triad relationship, although a few times a month, as foreplay, Liz would whip me or ask Cody to do it because it turned her on. Usually, though, my masters treated me like an appliance, and since Aunt Sheila had helped me transform my way of thinking, I had no problem with that whatsoever. In fact, I felt blessed that the Hansen family had found a use for me, and my entire being was focused on trying to make their lives better.

I had almost fallen asleep when my bedroom door creaked open and Cody barged in.

“I’m still horny and your mistress says she’s tired,” he announced. “Get up.”

I immediately positioned myself the way I knew my master wanted: On my knees, face to the mattress, while holding open my butt-cheeks with both hands. Wordlessly, he climbed onto my bed, spit on his target and slammed into me, causing me to squeal in agony and delight. Being unable to orgasm without testicles, prostate stimulation was the closest I ever came to sexual pleasure. When my master grabbed my ponytail and yanked my head back while ramming me like a jackhammer, causing my silicone boobs to smash into the bed, I embraced the screaming pain, and felt grateful that a man of such nobility had deemed to spend time with a lowly sissy eunuch like me.

After Master came for the second time that night, he lay back on my mattress and pointed to his sticky crotch. As I respectfully licked his cock and balls clean, he farted in my face and chuckled. I fought back a wave of nausea by reminding myself that it was an honor for my master to have shared such an intimate act with me.

When Cody was clean, he pushed my head aside, lifted his large body from my small bed and ambled away playing with his dick. He hadn’t said a word to me, other than when he’d first strode into my room and ordered me to wake up.

My asshole throbbed, my boobs were sore and my scalp hurt from having my hair pulled, but I fell asleep with a smile, thankful that I’d been allowed to please my wonderful mistress and master that evening.

The quiet of my slumber was shattered not ten minutes later with the evening’s second text. This one was from my pregnant mistress:

*I’m craving mcdonalds big mac meal spr size*

Within a few seconds, I’d texted her back: *I’m leaving now, Mistress*

With a weary sigh, I pulled myself out of bed, changed into a housedress, and drove to the nearest Mickey D’s.

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

My demanding schedule was taking a toll, and four cups of coffee barely kept me awake as I scurried around the kitchen getting things ready for Monday morning breakfast.

Brooke padded down to the dining room first, and I was quick to serve my twenty-one-year-old boss her usual cup of coffee with a half-teaspoon of honey and a dollop of heavy whipping cream.

“Good morning, Mirabella,” she said in response to my curtsey. “Just oatmeal this morning.”

Curtsey. “Of course, Miss. Would you like it now, or do you want to eat when everyone comes down, Miss?”

“I’ll wait.”

“Yes, of course, Miss.” Curtsey.

Brooke sipped her coffee. “How’s the history research going? It’s due Wednesday, remember.”

Oh, I remembered, all right — I’d spent what little free time I had the previous week helping Miss Brooke get her college thesis together.

“I’ve made good progress, Miss.” I curtseyed yet again. “I have the timeline laid out for all the civilizations like you wanted, Miss, and I’m almost done putting together the bibliography.”

“You’re so loyal.” Brooke smiled. “Go ahead and take away three check marks.”

Curtsey. “Oh, thank you, Miss.”

“Where are you at now? On your check marks, I mean.”

Curtsey. “Um, I’m at negative five, Miss, since you just took off the three. Thank you again, Miss — thank you SO much.”

“Negative five? Wow — you haven’t been punished in a while, have you?”

“N-no, Miss, I’ve been very lucky, Miss, and haven’t been getting a lot of check marks,” I replied with yet another curtsey.

Although Brooke was under the impression that I hadn’t been recently punished, she wasn’t aware of an incident three nights earlier, when her mother had flogged me before jumping Cody’s bones; while the previous week her dad had whipped my ass to make her mom horny.

Aside from what happened behind closed doors, though, my young boss was right — it had been almost two months since I’d accumulated enough check marks to warrant family discipline. The last time I’d been punished that way was when Cody blamed me for getting a phone number wrong when I took a message from a large group that wanted my master to be their guide on a fishing jaunt. My penance for that infraction was having to handwrite a twenty-thousand-word essay on the importance of maids paying attention to detail. And when I reported to my masters’ bedroom that night, Cody whipped the shit out of me with the wicked cane Aunt Sheila had left behind. Even though the girls were adults, Liz and Cody preferred keeping my corporal punishment private, since as far as they were concerned, it was foreplay.

I asked Brooke if she needed anything else, and when she said she didn’t, I curtseyed and drifted back to the kitchen. I had just opened the oatmeal canister when Mia’s shrill call startled me: “I need coffee out here, maid!”

Within seconds, I had poured Miss Mia’s coffee — black and bitter, just like her mood often was — and executed a respectful curtsey.

“Good morning, Miss, what would you like for breakfast this morning, Miss?”

“Ugh, do you have to be such a kiss-ass all the time?” Mia massaged her temples. “I’ve got a pounding headache — tone down the brown-nosing, okay?”

Curtsey. “S-sorry, Miss.”

“I’ll take bacon and eggs — lots of bacon.”

Curtsey. “Of course, Miss. Would you like to eat now, or—”

“Now. Yesterday. Hurry the fuck up!”

Curtsey. “Yes, Miss.” Scurry.

While I worked in the open kitchen, I listened to Brooke berate her little sister:

“What the hell’s your problem, Mia? Don’t take it out on Mirabella because you were out drinking again with and those two stoners from your store. All you guys do is go out and get hammered after work.”

“Pfft, don’t worry about what I do, Miss Equestrian Scholarship— I’m making good money at the shop, and if I want to spend it partying, that’s my fucking business.”

“Well, you don’t have to be a bitch and take it out on poor Mirabella. It’s not his fault you have no impulse control, and don’t know when to stop drinking — or how to save money. I’m going to school full-time, and I’ve got more saved up than you do.”

“Oh, fuck you, Brooke, get off your high horse.”

“Fuck YOU, bitch!”

Liz’s snarl interrupted the quibbling: “Geez, are you two at it AGAIN?”

“She’s got another hangover,” Brooke tattled. “And she’s being a bitch to Mirabella.”

“You two sound like a broken record, you know that?” Liz sat at the dining room table next to her husband yelled into the kitchen: “We need coffee out here.”

I rushed into the next room, poured my masters’ coffee and took their breakfast orders: Eggs and sausage for Mistress, while Master wanted bacon and eggs.

After serving the morning meal, I stood my post while the family discussed their plans for the day. Mia, having eaten prior to everyone else, sat there sipping coffee and orange juice, nursing her hangover, before finally announcing: “I feel like shit; I’m going back to bed. Mirabella, you can open up the shop; wait until Tayna or Madison get there, and I’ll be in later. I’ll text them to let them know.”

I dipped a double curtsey. “Yes, Miss, I’m so very sorry you’re not feeling well, Miss.”

Mia huffed. “Ugh, would you STOP being such a suck-ass?”

The remark made Cody scoff, which I figured was why Brooke didn’t scold her sister for being rude like she had earlier. Liz was too busy watching the morning news on TV to notice the insult.

When breakfast was done, my mistress kissed Cody goodbye and left for the office. He headed for his tackle shop a few minutes later, while Brooke had me pack her book bag before driving to the university.

Once everyone other than Mia had left, I removed the breakfast dishes from the table and washed them. Then, I changed into a plain housedress, hopped into my used Honda and drove to Lake City, where Mia’s store, The Korner Kloset, occupied a corner spot in a busy strip mall.

Mia’s two employees, Tanya and Madison, knew all about me, since my young mistress often had me come by the shop to do grunt work — and to show off her power over me.

I unlocked the store and busied myself straightening the merchandise. I had my own key, which allowed me to come to the shop three times a week at five in the morning to give the place a thorough cleaning. I also reported to Cody’s tackle shop to spruce up before it opened, although my master only required twice-weekly cleanings.

Madison, a tall blonde in her early twenties, was the first to report to work. She grinned when she spotted me.

“Well, he-llo, Mirabella,” Madison called in a sing-song voice. “Miss Mia’s not feeling good this morning, eh?”

I curtseyed, “No, Miss Madison, she said she’ll be in later.”

“Yeah, that’s what she said in her text. She was hitting it pretty hard at the club last night. She was so drunk, she dragged Conner into the men’s bathroom and fucked him in a stall with twenty people in there, hee-hee, the little slut.”

I shifted my weight, unsure how to respond.

Madison smirked. “So, have you gotten any check marks at home lately, Mirabella?”

“I … n-no, Miss, I’ve been lucky, Miss.” Curtsey.

“No starvation diets?”

“Um, no, Miss. Not in a while, Miss.”

The twentysomething party animal searched my eyes. “So, Mirabella — what’s it like being a eunuch? I was telling my boyfriend about you, and he said he can’t imagine what that must be like. Without balls, I mean.”

“Um, I … I don’t know, Miss.” I wasn’t sure what else to say, so I left it at that and hoped it would suffice.

It didn’t.

“Show me again.” She pointed at my crotch.

With a submissive smile, I hefted my skirt, pulled my panties to my knees, and lifted my tiny cock to expose my empty sac.

Madison’s eyes flashed. “So, do you still get horny with no balls?”

“I … it’s hard to explain, Miss. Kind of.”

“And you got your balls cut off because Mia’s dad made you?”

She already knew the damn story; she was just forcing me to recount it.

“Mia’s father wanted me to have the operation, Miss, but I did it of my own free will, Miss.”

“Because you simp for Mia’s mom?”

“Um, I do love her, Miss.”

“Tee-hee, you’ve got to be the world’s biggest simp. Go ahead and pull up your panties.”

After I complied, Madison continued talking to me while sifting through a rack of clothes. “Actually, I was telling my boyfriend I think it’s kind of romantic how you gave up so much for the woman you love. I mean, that’s giving up a LOT.”

Her assessment brought tears to my eyes. “T-thank you, Miss Madison.”

The young clerk giggled. “I asked my boyfriend if he’d do that for me, and he said HELLS no! I guess that’s the difference between guys like him, and … you know, sissies.”

Just then, Tanya came into the shop. When she noticed me, she jerked her thumb toward the door.

“Hey, Mirabella, my car’s out in the lot,” the pixy brunette said, tossing me her keys, which bounced off my chest and fell to the floor with a jingle, causing Madison to giggle. “The Turtle Wax and stuff’s all in the trunk.”

“Y-yes, Miss,” I said with a smart curtsey.

As I bent to retrieve the young vampire’s car keys, she smirked at me. “Mia says I can have you run some errands for me when you’re done washing my car, so hurry up and get that done, and then get back in here — because you’ve got a WHOLE LOT of running-around to do. M’kay?”

I curtseyed. “Yes, Miss.”

Although I was happy to make my young mistress look good by providing service for her friends, I wondered how in the world I’d ever get my chores done at home. With a sigh, I resigned myself to yet another night with little or no sleep.",1,1743083598.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

1jl487d,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1jl487d/newly_diagnosed_t2/,Newly diagnosed T2,"Hi Group.  I was recently diagnosed with T2 with a fasting(12 hour) glucose of 192, and an A1C of 7.5.  Met with the Dr and he prescribed metformin 1000mg per day, only taking 500mg now(started 3/21).  My ALT level was also about 30% above the high cutoff.  The dr wasn't concerned with the ALT number, and really didn't say it is related to T2, or separate.  I pretty much cut out all refined carbs 3/17 when I got the high fasting results.  I'm still eating about 50g a day, mostly nuts and low carb wraps/bread, greek yogurt, and berries.  Dr said I really don't need to test, and we could rely on the A1C in my next blood work.  I opted to test, since i like data and want to see what causes spikes.  



Here is my question.  I work on the road and often skip lunch if I'm stuck working on something.  Could the high ALT(fatty liver) contribute to high fasting bg levels due to glucose dumping?  I've only been low carb for about 10 days and on metformin for 6.  My blood sugar last night after eating(turkey chili with kidney beans, and some whole wheat tortillas) was 126 2.5 hours after the meal. I ate at 8:30 pm(later than normal).  My fasting blood sugar was 106 at 6 this morning.  I had 2 pieces of whole wheat toast for breakfast(6g net cars) with PB, a large black coffee, and my BG was 90 2 hours after eating.  Could the potential fatty liver been driving my spikes during times of fasting?  I know it's pretty early in my journey, but it seems like I'm on the right track now.  I don't know if it's worth sharing these results to the Dr, to see if he still wants me to up the metformin dose.",1,1743083036.0,type2diabetes,0,1.0,False

Last summer, my closest friends and I attended a huge teaching conference out of town. We were brought together by the scholarship that paid our way through college, and it had made us really close through all the hours we had to spend together. 

We stayed at an amazing resort in Florida for the 4-day professional development event. However, the friend I roomed with was not interested in the sessions and would instead stay in the room getting high or go to the pool and get drunk. Since she had no interest in actually learning, I stopped hanging out with her during the trip so I could attend all the sessions and get the most out of the experience.

We had grown closer during the trip, but her lack of engagement caused us to drift apart. At the time, I was also going through a difficult 3-year breakup, and she wasn't very supportive. So I distanced myself from her.

About 2 weeks after the trip, we hadn't spoken. Later, I found out that she and a few other friends had been hanging out with my ex, even though they knew how I felt about him and had previously talked badly about him. When I texted her about this, she argued that they weren't ""hanging out,"" just happened to be in the same place. But I knew they had sat together, rode together, and gone places together. They were all at the same first year teacher meetings. They all got coffee together & went shopping. I know this because my ex accidentally told me, assuming I already knew.

The argument didn't last long, as she didn't understand my frustration. I expressed that as one of the strongest females I know, I was hurt that she stood in my ex's face without considering my feelings. She never responded, and we left it there.

Months later, I texted her to apologize and wish her well before a Christmas party, but she left me on read. At the party, we didn't speak. 

Now, 7 months later, she has received an outstanding first-year teacher award in our district. When I texted to congratulate her, I found that I was blocked on iMessage and all platforms. Our scholarship coordinator has suggested a restorative meeting with her as the mediator, but I'm not sure if I want to engage further. I feel I've already apologized and communicated my feelings, while she hasn't done the same. I live a drama-free life, and this situation has been taking a toll on me.

As we prepare to attend the same conference in Dallas this summer, I'm unsure whether it’s an asshole move to leave things as they are or attend the suggested restorative meeting. If I do attend, I know for a fact that I don’t want to be forever friends with her. She definitely has shown me her character and I’m simply not a fan. ",0,1743082902.0,AITAH,17,0.5,False

1jl4530,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1jl4530/thoughts_on_the_new_havoc_campaign_sorry_for_the/,Thoughts on the new Havoc Campaign (sorry for the rant post).,"Preface I apologies in advance for the wall of ranty unpunctuated  text I’ve tried to put headings in so people can skip to certain sections but I’m under no illusion people will read this rant also no Ill will to any of the Devs, I’m sure a lot of design decisions are forced upon them with full knowledge of how the player base will react as they also play the game routinely.

Anyway:-

Currently I am clearance 37 in the new havoc campaign, prior to the update I have almost exclusively played Havoc 35-40 since its initial release.

**Pros**

**The decreased cool down between mob packs is fun**. Adds a new layer of intensity and feels like the typically defensive Havoc playstyle is punished more frequently if you stay in one spot too long you will get worn down and need to keep moving.

**Cons**

1)      **The game appears  to struggle with the increased spawn rate** at the moment and the audio just gives up after a while, what was already an annoying issue of getting ganked by silent X,Y,Z enemy is now even more of a problem wouldn’t be an issue as most players who play havoc don’t actually need to see the enemy to avoid them as their reactions to audio cues are good enough, only problem is the audio needs to exist in the first place Im sure this will improve over time though… (he said naively)

2)      **The new modifiers are lazy** I’ll be perfectly honest I don’t know what difference these new modifiers make  the groups I’ve been playing 35+ with seem to nuke everything so fast we aren’t engaging with the new  modifiers it’s just another level of the Havoc dps check that you won’t notice much aside from the odd CC immune crusher or rager but that’s rare for all intents and purposes enemies have a different hue and now come in apple, cherry and blueberry flavours.

The Daemonhost ritual is noticeable and is a 50/50 split on how fair it is to disrupt without a suicide charge that would in itself cause a wipe so get comfortable fighting a host say 20% of the time you see these events pop up based on my experience.

**The new Havoc ranking + deranking**

Where do I start? what a mess this was. This is what happens when you let the guy who makes the coffees pitch in during the design meeting. I know a few Youtubers have made comments about the absolute mess the ranking system is namely Reginald and Mr. E. e.g. why the hell is Havoc 40 not a game mode of its own? Why does darktide need a ranking system to begin with who was clamouring for that? All it does it force raid keys into Darktide. Forget the ladder, which is designed to insert grind, once I’ve earned Havoc 40 let me play that. It feels like FS have dug themselves a grave now they don’t know how to get out FYI the best way is to stop digging.

1)      **Removal of the weekly clearance bump.** I know they were worried about ‘boosting’ but honestly…who the hell is doing that? I’ve been playing high level Havoc for months the most I’ve seen people be boosted is from early 30s to 40 and Im talking about three or four times amongst hundreds of Havoc matches.  Currently you no longer rank up based on your previous weeks clearance you help a host clear a 35+ and you’re 30? That’s great for the host but too bad for his teammates, they all get a single rank up and next week they’re back to playing their piddley little 31s scrub! I know artificial grind when I see it.

 

**2)      The joint demotion.** Again this is FS attempting to remedy a issue of their own making. Whereby the host stumps up the highest price for the mission and has the most to lose. This new system erm incentivises people to play harder…I guess? I mean it’s Havoc who’s signing up to cost along? The joint demotion means people will slide down the ladder much more quickly and….say it with me folks…LEAVE THE GAME! That right it’ll put people off playing…well done mission accomplished everyone back to base for tea and medals. Now there’s less High end Havocs to go round with the few there are being precious. Meaning the player base will funnel itself.

To summarise. This is more of Fatshark’s weird kink with portion control. You had it with the rotating mission terminal, you had it with the previous ‘crafting system’ and cosmetic shop, now you’re getting it with Havoc. FS don’t want you to glut yourself on the content their devs and concept artists have pained over and poured their hearts                  into …nope you get this slice…no more no less… one slice at a time…come back next week for a chance to get another slice.",2,1743082783.0,DarkTide,1,0.75,False

1jl44s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1jl44s4/from_page_to_platform_prohibition_partners/,From Page to Platform: Prohibition Partners Unveils Interactive Cannabis Intelligence Hub,"*Prohibition Partners* will soon be launching the 10th addition of their industry leading European Cannabis Report, marking the milestone with a ground-up overhaul of its tried and trusted format.

In April 2025, *Prohibition Partners* will launch a new digital knowledge hub, offering readers the same in-depth and up-to-date analysis they’ve come to expect from the company, in an easy-to-navigate, consistently updated, interactive format.

The choice to transition away from a traditional point-in-time publishing schedule comes at a critical time for the industry, which has undergone transformational changes in the last 12 months.

In order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape in real time, this new digital hub will act as a one-stop-shop for businesses, patients and stakeholders alike to gain valuable insight and analysis into 31 of the world’s most critical cannabis markets.

Its new always-on dynamic digital platform will feature interactive maps, real-time data visualisations, and continuously updated insights covering everything from regulations and pricing to domestic production, imports, and exports.

These insights will be built from the industry’s most in-depth datasets which have been a mainstay of *Prohibition Partners* reporting since 2017.



“Since 2017, we’ve been charting the evolution of cannabis markets across Europe, we knew it was time for something new that matched the pace, scale, and complexity of what’s happening on the ground,” *Prohibition Partners* CEO, Stephen Murphy, explained.

“This isn’t just a new edition of our report—it’s a complete reimagining of how we deliver insights and data. The digital knowledge hub gives businesses, policymakers, and patients real-time access to the data and analysis they need to navigate an industry that is no longer changing year by year, but week by week.”

Alongside these new, easily digestible resources painting a clear picture of the international cannabis framework across Europe, the site will also delve deep into individual markets pushing the boundaries of cannabis reform.

In Germany, landmark cannabis legislation enacted in April 2024 triggered a rapid restructuring of the medical market, while also giving rise to cultivation associations for adult-use cannabis across several federal states. However, political uncertainty now surrounds the country’s second-phase adult-use pilot programs, following a change in government led by the conservative CDU/CSU party.

Meanwhile, the Netherlands is preparing to roll out Europe’s largest-ever adult-use cannabis trial on April 7th, 2025. Ten municipalities, representing a population of over 1.6 million, will see coffee shops selling cannabis exclusively sourced from licensed and regulated supply chains—marking a historic shift in the country’s drug policy.

In Switzerland, seven adult-use cannabis trials are already underway. While full results have yet to be released, early indicators are promising. The Swiss National Council has formally adopted a proposal to draft legislation for the full legalisation of adult-use cannabis, with early drafts expected in the coming months.

On the medical front, the UK continues its steady climb, with a doubling of cannabis import volumes year-on-year, and the first UK-cultivated medical products now entering the market. Patient interest and clinical adoption are both growing as awareness expands. At the same time, Germany and the UK are positioning themselves as key European manufacturing hubs for medical cannabis extracts.

With a growing patchwork of regulations, production models, and patient access schemes across Europe, *Prohibition Partners*’ new digital format promises to be a vital tool for investors, policymakers, operators, and advocates. The hub is expected to be a cornerstone resource for those navigating the complexity of Europe’s fragmented but fast-expanding cannabis ecosystem.

1jl445h,https://i.redd.it/d2np4z0tj8re1.jpeg,Update on - Should I approach this Girl in the park ? (she made Eye contact everytime ),"
[Previous Post for more details 
](https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/s/vCwup2IOLh)

TL;DR – I approached her, we talked for two days, and went on a coffee date. Twist – She told me she wasn’t single only when I asked her. And she left me with a very intriguing question.

So, I approached her the next day. She was listening to music with earphones. I tried to speak up but hesitated 3–4 times at the last moment. Somehow, I finally said ""Hi"" as she was walking past me. She stopped after passing me (I thought she ignored me) and then came back. As expected, I stuttered in the very first sentence – ""So early today?"" she replied something. But my mind went blank after that. Luckily, she saved the conversation and started asking me questions (Phew!).

We walked together and talked for half an hour. Then we went to a roadside coffee shop. She paid before I could even pull my phone out and didn’t accept the money from me later. When we were about to leave, I asked for her Instagram,she did gave it but she didn’t accept my request on it.

The next day, she was again walking in the park. We talked and walked for an hour. She even mentioned how she couldn’t approach me and all. But… after all this, I casually asked her, ""So, you must be single, right?"" To which she replied, ""Nope…...yada yada..."" and told me she was in a long-distance relationship.

The next day, we just passed each other with a smile and a quick ""Hi."" After that, my park timing changed, so I didn’t see her again.

But the question that still bothers me is – Why did she keep making eye contact with me every single time for three days and even admit that she couldn't approach me… IF SHE WASN'T EVEN SINGLE ?

1jl432t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jl432t/aita_for_telling_my_flatmate_she_cannot_have_his/,AITA for telling my flatmate she cannot have his boyfriend over,"Hello guys, I just want to start out with saying, I love watching Charlotte's videos I'm a Virgo too so I naturally was clicking with your personality <3 Also english is not my first language so if I make any mistakes please excuse me. Now to my story. (Sorry this might be long)

I am 24 (M) and live with my friend of 6-7 years, let's call her Bertha (24, F). We live together for a little more than 1 and a half year, we has had some arguements before, but this time I feel like Im going to explode with everything that piled up over the years.

When we moved in I was super excited, because this was gonna be the first time I have my own room, since I moved away from home, and the house we found was super nice as well. So naturally, i could not control myself, and wanted to start our chapter together as flatmates in the best manner, so I bought some stuff that we would still to this day use together, that are general household stuff (hoover, hair dryer, clothes steamer, bathroom mat, hairstraightener, sandwich cooker), some of which she uses more often than me. Not that I would expact her to pay for all of that since I bought them without saying anything to her, but she never even thanked me for it, or acknowledged it. Also important thing is that I use NOTHING that is hers, the only thing I have used sometime (3-4 times) is an airfryer, but nothing that I would use every day. This already left some bad taste in my mouth.

Another thing is her needs. She cannot sleep with the slightest noise, or light in the house, so of course I tried to accomodate her as much as I could. For example, I like to wake up with the sun shining in my window, but I started to sleep with my shutter down (I am european, we have built in shutters in like all apartments) because our rooms have glass doors, and the light could be seen in her room. But even then were times, when I would be playing with my friends on the computer, and she would come in my room and tell me to be quiet because she has to work the next morning, which is of course, very fair, BUT! This is where things start to go south for me. You might be asking yourself now, what does she do for me, that makes me more comfortable at home. Nothing. I never asked her to change a thing. Of course I was thinking about this, because I am trying to be as objective as possible, but I just cannot think of a time where I conforonted her about something that makes me uncomfortable UNTIL RECENTLY.

She started to bring friends over. And I mean at first It wasn't that bad, of course I had friends over as well, but it was kinda different. For example, when I invited friends over most of the time she wasn't even at the apartment, because she went back to our hometown to visit family, so it wouldn't affect her at all. And of course I cleaned the house after as well, so I don't distrub her in any way. Or when I invited friends over when she was here, I made sure she was okay with it, and didn't have to work the next morning, or we stayed really quiet.

This is not what happened with her friends however. She started to offer our house to friends, who didnt even come here to meet her, there were times when friends just came to the city for a concert, slept at her room, then left the next morning. This was really weird to me, like she just let others use her for free accomodation. She also never even considered if I have to wake up the next morning for work, and many times I woke up to her and her friends having a shower at 4-5 AM after party (my room is next to the bathroom so I can hear the tap going off) or using the microwave, the very loud coffee machine and I NEVER complained to her about this. This is where I have to refer back to when I said I asked her for one thing. I am a very ambivert person. Outside I can be very social, and loud, but at home I like to feel safe, and charge myself socially and mentally. She knows this. I told her this many times. When people come here who I dont know I get kinda anxious, and disturbed, I cannot be free even in my own room, closed in. It just makes me uncomfrotable. Another important thing is: She has the bigger room, and our huge built-in wardrobe is there, so If I want to get my clothes I have to go in her room. I think you can guess what that means. Even if she has friends over i have to go over to get my stuff, which is very awkward, and just makes me overthink about when I should go in and stuff. This has resulted in me wearing the same clothes for multiple days, because I couldnt get myself to knock and go in.

Recently she got a boyfriend, lets call him Brian. Brian lives in a different country, which is like a 3 hour flight from here, so this is a distant relationship. When they got together she told me, he might stay at our place for a few days. At first I was kinda reluctant, but agreed since I didnt want to clash, and I could bare a few days once in a while. Well it was not fine. After 1 month of them being together Bertha told me that Brian is gonna go on holiday at his workplace for a little more than a month, and he might stay at our place a few times in february. Here I have to say I was wrong for agreeing with her, but I didnt know what she meant by a few more times. February is 28 days long. If i counted correctly he stayed here for 15 days. Half of the month. Not in one go, but in like parts. 3 days once, then next week 4 days, then next week 2 days like this. This has started to annoy me so much, I could not hide my feelings, I am a virgo after all, my emotions can be read on my face. We started to be very weird around each other after this. Then in the middle of this, she told me she was gonna invite over another girlfriend to sleep over yet again. I said yes again. But at this point I was done. I have to highlight this as well, that I work part time at Zara and go to uni every day. I also dance as a hobby, so I have practices once or twice a week, and meet with my friends, so you could guess, I am not home often. But as I said before, when Im home I would want to rest and recharge myself, but due to this whole sleepover thing, I started to become very exhausted and annoyed. Then at the last week when Brian was supposed to leave, her grand father died. Which is of course a very sad and unfortunate thing. But for me this meant that he stayed in our cuntry for 2 more weeks. And he didnt even spend most of it with his family in his hometown, but at our apartment. This pissed me off even more.

I wrote a message to her, when she told me last minute he was staying at our apartmant again, that next time she should just book an airbnb or hotel for them, because at this point this is just too much, and i cannot take this anymore. After that we sat down and talked, but I dont feel heard at all. Bertha started to pity herself, saying that its hard for them, because they cannot meet as often as they would like, and this was a good opportunity for them to stay together more. Of course, I couldnt stand my ground and gave in, and let it go. BUT NOW i really feel like Im done.

Last week she had her friends over before they went for a party. When she goes out with these friends they do stuff in the room before a party (u know kinda illegal stuff) which I also told her I am not comfortable with, but she never cared, she just bragged about where she hides it in her room. I had work the next morning but this also never disturbed her. I could sleep till 11PM and when she came home around 5AM she started to use the very loud coffee machine, and the microwave which I of course woke up to. The worst part is, that I was next in cleaning duty this week, but I thought she was gonna do it after she had like 4-5 friends over. No. She asked me to clean the house this week. This really hit something in me. But again, my fault, I never expressed this to her. But then Bertha told me she was gonna go to Brians country sometimes, but he will come here every 2-3 weeks too.

Im scared I would be a Karen for thinking this way, but all my friends said that this is too much, some even told me they have a no boy rule in their apartment and nobody brings boys over ever. I am just very fed up with this situation. I want to tell her again with more confidence that If they want to sleep somewhere, they should get a place somewhere else, but i am done with them using this place as a hotel, and not even considering me. I feel like she should stop offering our flat as an option to anyone to use for their liking, and be more empathetic towards me. She also never reimbursed me for the long time he stayed here, we payed the bills as usual, half-half, and she didnt buy stuff like toilet paper instead of me, just kept going the same way as usual. I feel annoyed and mad at this point.

1jl4203,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1jl4203/roommates_gf/,Roommates Gf,"I (M27) have been living with an acquaintance (M27) for two months now. One of my close friends is his cousin and he connected us both while we were searching for a new lease. We’ve met a few times before but nothing to the extend of me really knowing him or to call him a close friend. I work from home and he works from the office so I like the balance of having space and not seeing each other all day.

He has a long distance relationship with a girl who lives in Canada. He went to visit her recently for a weekend and when he came back he said “just a heads up, my girl is coming in a few days for 17 days”…… at first I was unsure on how to approach the situation but he explained she was participating in a running event blah blah blah … even though 17 days is a lot I said “got it”, keep in mind he did not ask me if I was ok with it, he just told me she was coming. Our apartment is very very small and truthfully it’s only meant for 2 people.

She ended up staying for 4 days and then left to renew her visa and then came back a few days later. I work from home and he told me she would be working from her company’s US office or from a coffee shop so I would barely see her. She has been working from the apartment everyday and taking phone calls and meetings from the living room. He even went out of his way to replace the coffee table in our living room for a coffee table that turns into a desk so she can work….A few days ago I noticed he had made her a key without running it by me…. Since he has no closet her luggage and bags are in the living room…. I also overheard he calling credit card companies and phone companies to set her US address as my address…..one of the things that pisses me off the most is that when they are in the living room they have baby talk, “Baby do you love me 🥺” “Baby can you give me a kiss please🥺” holy shit guys go to the fucking bedroom I don’t want to hear that shit….She is supposed to leave on Sunday but I get this feeling that she won’t be leaving on Sunday and knowing myself if she’s not gone on Sunday I may have to speak with both of them and ask what’s going on.

I joked about it in the original post but I am in fact walking her to and from work, we decided it was best since unfortunately for her, we live in a red city, in a red state and she works nights at a bar and we had a talk and concluded that drunk people and transphobia probably don't mix well, especially since now she's starting to try going out presenting female.

The sleeping situation is hella awkward for me still, at least it's a big bed, but i fell from it trying to keep my distance a couple times already, she on the other hand doesn't seem to mind very much, or maybe it's just the fact that she sleeps like a rock from being tired of work, idk.

Yesterday we went out grocery shopping and it was her first time having nail polish and makeup in public, she was very nervous so i had her do my nails as well so we could do it together, i felt awkward but her smile was worth it, she has it rough, i can take a bit of feeling silly.

We're going shopping for clothes for her this weekend, i offered to go with and she said it would help a lot, so I'll go.

1jl3x6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernLuxuryKitchen/comments/1jl3x6i/how_to_choose_a_german_kitchen_that_matches_your/,How to Choose a German Kitchen That Matches Your Lifestyle,"The purpose of this document is to provide a clear, practical guide for individuals who are considering a German kitchen, and want something aligned with both lifestyle and functionality. It does not aim to promote a brand or aesthetic trend, but rather to explore what factors are most relevant when making a long-term, high-investment decision about a home kitchen.

# Understanding the German Kitchen Philosophy

The first relevant distinction when discussing German kitchens is their fundamental philosophy, which differs from many other global approaches. These kitchens are characterized by an emphasis on precision engineering, ergonomic layouts, and an optimized user experience. This is not marketing fluff; it is a direct consequence of cultural and industrial norms in Germany, where manufacturing is often deeply systematized. German kitchen design is modular, adaptable, and engineered for long-term durability. The design reflects a broader cultural inclination toward efficiency, problem-solving, and functionality. Before moving on to color swatches or appliance preferences, users should internalize this foundational perspective—it helps frame every subsequent decision.

# Assessing Your Lifestyle Needs

Functionality should follow utility. To determine which kitchen suits your needs, begin by identifying what your kitchen is for. The temptation is often to jump into aesthetics, but unless you know whether your kitchen is primarily for cooking, socializing, multitasking, or hosting, you risk buying the wrong setup. Think about how often you cook, how many people typically use the kitchen simultaneously, whether your household is likely to change in the near future (e.g., new children, aging relatives, roommates), and whether you require dedicated zones for specific tasks like food preparation, technology, coffee, or pets. These responses help build a behavioral profile to ensure the kitchen supports your life rather than complicates it.

# Exploring Design Aesthetics and Layouts

German kitchens are often associated with minimalism, but they are not inherently sterile. The visual identity of these kitchens is a product of function-first engineering, which often results in clean lines, invisible storage solutions, and concealed hardware. Layouts such as the galley, L-shape, and island-centric designs are all common. The critical consideration is how the physical layout corresponds to your behavioral flow. This is where the kitchen work triangle becomes relevant, optimizing movement between the sink, refrigerator, and stove. High-volume cooks may benefit from compartmentalized designs, whereas those who entertain may prefer open, flexible spaces. It is also advisable to avoid over-personalization if resale value is a concern—functional flow retains its value better than passing trends.

# Choosing Materials and Finishes

When selecting materials for cabinetry, countertops, and surfaces, the German kitchen framework emphasizes high durability, easy maintenance, and clean finishes. Engineered materials like laminate, composite stone, and anodized metals are generally preferred for their resilience over purely aesthetic options. Aesthetic aspects are a secondary benefit derived from functional choices. Matte finishes minimize fingerprints, high-gloss surfaces expand perceived space through light reflection, and wood veneers offer a warmer contrast to industrial surfaces. These decisions must also align with your maintenance tolerance and the presence of children or pets. Ultimately, these choices prioritize functionality and lifespan over ornamentation.

# Integrating Technology and Smart Features

Smart features in kitchens are no longer novelty items. In the German context, technology is introduced where it reduces friction, not as a gimmick. Examples of meaningful integration include induction cooktops with precision controls, motion-activated cabinet lighting, sensor-operated faucets, and smart refrigerators with inventory management capabilities. Each of these should be critically assessed for their practical value. Not all technology is intuitive or universally beneficial; some systems introduce complexity, require regular updates, or depend on third-party apps that may become obsolete. Adopt technology that addresses specific inefficiencies or pain points rather than seeking features based on popularity or aesthetics.

# Budgeting and Investment Considerations

German kitchens typically involve a higher initial investment compared to mass-market alternatives, but this should be framed in terms of long-term value. Their engineering quality and modularity reduce the need for future repairs or complete overhauls. Expenses generally include design consultations, installation labor (which may be separate from materials), appliances (which are often integrated), and long-term maintenance. There is also an opportunity cost to consider: inadequate layouts and poor-quality materials can degrade your daily experience and even reduce your home's value. Transparency with vendors about budget constraints is crucial, as many German kitchen components are bespoke and non-interchangeable.

# Customization and Modularity

One of the most practical advantages of German kitchens is their modularity. Units are designed for configurability, making them suitable for unique spatial needs including accessibility, dietary separation, or semi-commercial applications. Cabinet widths, drawer internals, door mechanisms, and shelving types can all be tailored. This adaptability is not simply an aesthetic benefit; it future-proofs your kitchen. As household dynamics change, modular systems allow for reconfiguration without complete renovation. That long-term flexibility is one of the central reasons these systems stand apart.

# Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Practices

Sustainability is a baseline expectation in many German manufacturing models. These kitchens often use FSC-certified wood, comply with rigorous emissions protocols, and integrate seamlessly with energy-efficient appliances. Additionally, kitchens can be designed with built-in recycling systems, low-emission finishes, and water-conserving fixtures. These features contribute to both environmental sustainability and indoor air quality. Always look for verified third-party certifications to ensure claims are substantiated, as marketing language is not a substitute for documented compliance.

# Leveraging Professional Expertise

If your goal is a kitchen that is structurally sound, highly functional, and long-lasting, the input of a professional designer is almost non-negotiable. Designers familiar with German systems understand component compatibility, can navigate supply chains efficiently, and ensure compliance with building codes and ergonomic standards. Their ability to simulate and iterate designs digitally adds enormous value and can help avoid costly mistakes related to clearances, ventilation, and integration. DIY solutions often miss these critical layers of planning.

# The Role of Product Research

Due diligence is essential. German kitchens often use proprietary fittings and unique dimensions, so assuming universality across brands is risky. Research should focus on appliance compatibility, maintenance logistics, customer service responsiveness, and the real-world aging of finishes. Rely on technical documentation and post-installation case studies rather than influencer content or showroom visuals. Informed decisions are the foundation of functional outcomes.

# Navigating the World of Kitchen Catalogs

Gaining access to detailed [Kitchen catalogs](https://www.leichtca.com/catalogs) is a necessary step in narrowing choices. These documents provide specifications on dimensions, finish compatibility, and appliance integration. They also clarify which components are standard versus special order. Reviewing a catalog with your floor plan in hand allows for accurate cross-referencing, helping eliminate configuration conflicts early in the process. It also facilitates more efficient conversations with design professionals and suppliers.

# Drawing Inspiration from Modern European Kitchens

Much of the value in observing [modern European kitchens](https://www.leichtca.com/design) lies not in their visual language, but in their structural logic. These kitchens are models of efficient space utilization, subtle material harmonies, and appliance integration. Common characteristics include flush-mounted or handleless cabinetry, muted color palettes, and strategically zoned lighting. Rather than treating them as aesthetic templates to copy, use them as models of what it looks like when function and form are aligned with clear intent.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing a German kitchen that matches your lifestyle is not a decorative exercise. It is a logistics project, a spatial optimization problem, and a long-term economic decision. Success depends on prioritizing real behaviors over aspirational images and investing in systems that offer measurable value—not just showroom appeal. By grounding your decisions in usage patterns, objective constraints, and verified specifications, you can develop a kitchen that serves your life—not just your Pinterest board.",1,1743082125.0,ModernLuxuryKitchen,0,1.0,False

I (29m) am running into a hard time just finding someone to talk to. I had a gf all through college and a a rebound gf after our breakup around our graduation time frame. I've learned rebounding isn't a great thing, no need to reiterate this point for me.

After this last break up, which was maybe 4 years ago, I decided to work on loving myself and also being more emotional as a human being. I grew up in an abusive household where my 2 grandparents didn't love each other anyway. Always argued with each other, talked about divorces to us kids, etc. I realized that I never knew what a healthy relationship was. I realized that I was checking off some sort of mental checklist that men are supposed to do. Like pay some of her bills, physically be available if something happens, like a car accident. However, while I was doing this, I never was emotionally there. I was just going to school and going to work. That's where my energy was.

I've grown to understand that I DONT know exactly what I want because anything that I would want is based on old ideals from a broken household. But I also think that may be the problem. It feels like I can't land a date through dating apps by being honest. I don't know exactly what lady I'm looking for, is it so wrong for me to ask for a cup of coffee and a conversation while we figure out if we can even talk to each other?

Don't get me wrong, I can make lady friends. I've met a few great women that I've become close friends throughout my life. Like at work, enjoying hobbies like gaming, traveling, etc. I don't think I come off as a creepy guy. Hell, one of my friends I recently made trusted me with dogsitting for her. I wash my hands regularly and can tell you my shower, skin, and hair routines. Roughly 6ft tall and weigh 220ish or so. I'm don't think these are repulsive stats.

Until the last few weeks, he's typically behaved a lot like a cat does - stubborn, only wants to be petted or cuddled when HE feels like it on his terms lol, and gets a burst of energy at certain times of the day, then is a couch potato sleeping for the rest of the day and night. He usually gets his bedtime walkies around 830pm-9pm and then has the zoomies after, then konks out for the whole night on the rug or the couch near the front door/window on the main floor, while we all sleep upstairs. He will come upstairs in the morning when he hears my alarm go off, etc.  

LATELY - he's been more affectionate and needy for company and attention throughout the day, insisting on being petted or cuddled ALL THE TIME. And he will come upstairs in the middle of the night and will get on my kid's bed and wake him up (not even wanting to sleep on the bed because he will hop off), sniff around, lick his paws loudly, and is just generally restless for hours through the night, sometimes scratching at my door -- which used to signal that he has to pee or his tummy hurts in emergency situations, but now it seems like he just doesn't want to be alone and it's not about needing to go outside. 

When I get up around 630-700am, I used to let him out for a quick pee while I drink my coffee and get my kids ready for school, then take him on a big walk about an hour later, then he eats breakfast after that. I started walking him later at night and making sure that he does poop. He does have a history of eye/ear infections (he had entropian surgery a couple years ago and hasn't had eye issues since) and skin infections and allergies...but he doesn't seem to be suffering with anything at the moment that seems obvious to me. His fur looks okay, his eyes are okay, his ears are a challenge for me to stay on top of but don't seem to be bothering him now. He's eating and drinking normally...

Well, to be specific, I was a contractor at a major international organisation as a policy analyst, and they were not able to renew my contract due to budgetary and HR reasons. It happens more often than it doesn't in this line of work and if anything it was silly of me to not expect it to happen to me, but it was still massively destabilising, especially because losing my employment also meant losing my diplomatic visa, my apartment, and my life in the city that I've been living in for over 4 years. I'm now facing moving back in with my parents to save money while I apply for jobs and I've been feeling just absolutely horrible. I've been lucky in the sense that I never faced prolonged unemployment, I graduated from my master's program almost 3 years ago and joined my IO right away and been there since. I'm someone who was always taught to value achievement, business, perfectionism above all else and I felt great about my career picking up speed. There were times when I was extremely bored by the work or resented my extremely toxic team, but I would be lying if I said I didn't care about the prestige and whatever other accolades. Since it all disappeared into thin air, I've come to face the realisation that I have no idea who I am outside of my identity as an overachiever, and I feel horrible. 

  
Job hunting has sucked so far. I've been riddled with anxiety and self-loathing. I forgot how anxious and panicked I get in interviews, how when I'm in the hot seat I forget all the answers (no matter how much I study and practice before) and all I can think about is how the interviewer thinks I'm an idiot, stupid moron, and why did I even show up. I know it's irrational, but these are the thoughts I have. Last night I was yet again crying to my boyfriend about how stupid and useless and direction-less I feel. 

  
I don't know, I know two months is not that long to be unemployed, but I'm honestly just really embarrassed to be in this situation at this stage in life. I feel ashamed and worthless all the time and I'm so discouraged by spending my days with filling out online applications, perusing linkedin, and setting up networking coffee chats. I've worked so hard to not be in this place in life right now. I just needed to rant I guess.

Five years after it was approved by the city at half the cost, the plan by a Rochester-based developer to convert a Louise Bethune-designed industrial building in Larkinville into apartments is once again cleared to proceed to construction, starting this summer.

But this time, it’s all apartments, with no office space or restaurant. And besides seeking state and federal tax credits, the developer is including some affordable housing in order to qualify for tax breaks needed to make the financing work.

Park Grove Realty received approval again on Monday to renovate the former Iroquois Door Co. manufacturing and distribution facility. Designed by Bethune and constructed in 1904, the 93,500-square-foot building is located at 619 Exchange St., just a couple of blocks west of the Larkin at Exchange office building and Larkin Square.

Plans call for renovation of the four-story building into 59,614 square feet of apartment space, dubbed Iroquois Lofts, with 64 studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, for a total of 77 bedrooms. Ten of the apartments, or 15%, will be “workforce” or affordable housing, targeted for individuals or households earning no more than 80% of the area median income.

Buffalo Public Schools has at last acquired Fosdick Field, the grassy 4-acre parcel next to City Honors School.

As with most property controlled by the school district, the field is now formally owned by the City of Buffalo, which paid $2.05 million to the nonprofit City Honors/Fosdick-Masten Foundation. That money will ultimately go to the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority, which controlled the property before transferring it to the foundation in 2016.

The purchase follows more than a decade of planning and negotiation between the city, the school district, the foundation and the BMHA. It was a complex transaction that additionally required sign-off from federal regulators.

""Something that was lost and people thought it could not be put back together is back — and permanently protected,"" said William Kresse, principal of City Honors.

The goal is to build a sports field on a portion of the site and landscape the rest to bring it closer to its historical look, Kresse said.

My understanding is the first episode will likely be publicly available for free next week, but the first four are at this moment available via their Patreon, which is where I heard them, and I believe Brett mentions this in episode 2.

It's strange that it's not mentioned more often that when Damien Echol's mother Pamela Hutchison talked to the police on May 12, 1993 she told them that on May 4, 1993 (the day before the murders on May 5) that she separated from Damien's biological father Eddie joe Hutchison, who had been living with them but he moved all his possessions out that very day. According to Pamela, the separation, which ultimately only lasted 2 weeks, was due to Pamela insisting that her second husband Andy Jack Echols should still be able to have contact with Damien and his sister, despite the allegations that he had molested Damien's sister and been psychologically abusive to both of them. Pamela stated that this caused Damien to cry, which was unusual, and she told the police, ""THERE (sic) NATURAL FATHER HAD DESERTED THEM WHEN THEY WERE BOTH REAL SMALL AND UH, I GUESS HE FELT LIKE HE WAS DOING IT AGAIN."" 

This is the kind of trigger that could potentially lead to a particularly violent act being committed by a young person with a history of violent outbursts and diagnosed serious psychological issues and who was taking mind-altering medications prescribed for those issues which may or may not have been working as desired esp. if other drugs were consumed like alcohol. This just doesn't look good, and it's what she said 8 days after the separation and 7 days after the murder. Which may be why Pamela changed her story after Damien's arrest and by September 10, 1993 Damien's mother told the prosecutors that in fact she and Joe Hutchison had separated on May 9, 1993 and she had misremembered previously. This change in the story is a little dubious, I have to say. Links and excerpts from statements are below.

EDIT: Probably worth adding here that from my quick reading of the files, the murders also happened in the middle of the period of 1-2 months when Jason Baldwin's mother Gail Grinnell had temporarily  separated from her husband and Jason's step-father Terry Grinnell and had brought her new boyfriend Dennis ""Dirk"" Dent to live with them. Dent was a petty criminal and was in jail for car theft by the time Jason was arrested. So a pretty unstable time in Jason's home too.

**Chapter I**

**In Media Res**

Astral was running, screaming for the crazy spirit shaped like a humanoid rat to stop. He had to dodge through a crowd of surprised and confused normal humans who had no idea why the strange white man was running through Shibuya’s alleys while screaming like a mad man in perfect Japanese. He was about to lose sight of the crazy spirit when a police officer noticed him and the spirit and quickly gave chase to the spirit as well. The officer was faster on his feet than Astral was and quickly caught up to the spirit and cornered it. It was sobbing rather predictably as Astral approached.

“Please stop the bad man...” The spirit cried.

The officer watched Astral carefully, as Astral pulled out his ID and handed it to the officer. 

“I’ve been following this little bastard and his goddamned ‘kawaii-desu’ psychos for three weeks now for Massengale Inc.” Astral gasped, desperately trying to get air into his lungs, “Just caught them trading off corporate secrets after posing as mascots.” 

The officer handed back Astral’s ID and nodded, “We’ll need to hold him, her?” He looked at the spirit for confirmation.

“Oh...” The spirit frowned and its gray white fur turned a deep brown splotched with blood red. 

The spirit went to leap at the officer but found itself bound by chains of light that dug into it’s body and caused it to scream. 

“MERCY!” The spirit shrieked.

“You killed a living human.” Astral snapped, “Not a daemon, not a skin suit. Man likely had a family. You know what that means.” 

“You ain’t got the balls!” The rat hissed as it bit through two of the chains and quickly darted off.

“Homicidal Spirit on the loose, we have one exorcist class here!” The officer shouted into his radio.  

“Get more.” Astral grumbled, “He ain’t really that small or cute.” 

As the rat ran off it grew to the size of a silverback gorilla and became fully physical. It pushed people down and plowed through a wall as it grabbed a metal traffic sign for a weapon.

Astral’s wings spread and he focused on where he wanted to be. He saw the beast with multiple smaller rats hanging from the large tail of the Rat-King. He wasn’t sure how one had gotten this strong, but now it was a threat and that meant taking it down hard and fast. He grinned as he thought back to his latest training with Baba Yaga.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

The smack of the cane was quickly blocked by Astral’s foot, not that it lessened the pain that the crazy old woman had inflicted on him. He glared down at her as he balanced a bucket of fish heads on his own head and basket of them in each arm. He wasn’t sure what the crazed being was doing, but Lucifer had asked him to trust her when he made the exchange of old favors for his student to learn under the crone.

“You have good balance.” Baba Yaga nodded, “Put it down.” 

Astral sighed and dumped it all over. He regretted that almost immediately as Baba Yaga’s living hut went into hunger mode and immediately began to peck at and devour all the fish and very nearly took his leg with them. 

“You alive?” Baba Yaga asked.

“Yes. Mama Yaga.” Astral sighed as he addressed the crone as she preferred, he wasn’t about to anger the woman who could casually devour daemons and purge in the same sitting. “I am safe, but I’m confused as to why you’re doing all these martial arts tests?”

“Trying to provoke some usage of the light, Shield.” Baba Yaga muttered. “Something should have made you use it.” 

“Nothing here is actively a threat.” Astral shrugged. “I can call a small amount at will, use it for Babel, but it mostly comes to me in fights and when I need it.” 

“That is not how the Light works.” Baba Yaga arched an eyebrow, “Unless someone altered how you use it?”

Astral just stared and shrugged, “I’m not a sage or philosopher.” 

“No, this would be a deity’s domain.” Baba Yaga grumbled, “And since yours has been absent for some time...” 

Astral stared at her before nodding, he didn’t know how she knew that, but it also didn’t matter. 

“If this is how the Light comes to you, every fight must be practice, until you can bring it all forward.” Baba Yaga laughed, “So I will make arena for you to fight in. You will come when it is ready, I will have many things for you to fight.” 

Astral nodded and smiled, an actual fight had sounded good to him then. What he hadn’t expected was that his first opponent would be a kidnapped and angry Russian WereBear that did not want to listen to him. Astral had barely survived the encounter, but Baba Yaga got what she needed. She had determined with a single fight that the “Light” was indeed within him like it should be, but he had had such a botched teaching of it growing up that he had to quickly “Unlearn” his old channeling methods.

He spent close to a month learning from crone after that. Days spent getting whacked with a cane or other sticks. A week and a half away from what he had come to see as his family was the worse part. In the end though, Baba Yaga had taught him what Lucifer struggled to, and the Fallen was nothing if not put off by that. That had made the whole effort somewhat worth it to Astral, but more importantly it had made him even stronger against daemons and other evils of the world.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

The training kicked in and Astral blew past the Rat King faster than it could react. The creature had tried to hit him with the sign, but it only passed through air as Astral landed in the building and rushed forward to the Rat King, ran up its back and drove his fist into the skull of the beast. The creature roared and tossed Astral through another wall. 

Astral stood and dusted himself off as he watched a small vehicle approach. He couldn’t help but grin, the tiny high speed tank belonged to Tech Tanuki. Tech Tanuki was an odd one, an exorcist class hero with a tech focus. To Astral he was a new friend who enjoyed the nephilim’ company as much as Astral enjoyed his. The vehicle skidded to a halt and the small furry form popped out.

“What we got, good-buddy?” Tech asked as he held a specially made rifle that fired bursts of electricity as bolas.  

“Rat King. Real strong.” Astral sighed, “Punch didn’t do anything. And he killed a guy.” 

“Oh...” Tech pressed a button and the rifle’s ammo switched to red glowing bolts. “Uncooperative and violent. Well, Bessie is ready.” 

Astral shook his head. “You watch too many old western shows.” 

“The best!” Tech smiled as he armed the weapon. “Why isn’t it out here yet?” 

Astral sighed, “It’s hiding inside where I can’t fly.” He approached the hole in the wall.

“Well that’s not fair.” Tech followed.

Astral peeked in and looked around before looking back, “Looks cl-” A giant clawed hand grabbed Astral’s head and yanked him in and threw him through two more walls.

“I don’t think it’s clear!” Tech shouted as he fired his rifle and avoided the larger, more dangerous Rat King. “Was it this big before?” 

Astral stood again and shook the cobwebs from his mind, when he got a look at the beast it had clearly grown a few feet. “Nope, it’s feeding!” 

Astral rushed back to the fight and called upon the words of Babel to make a shield of light that used to help Tech Tanuki get cover. They huddled behind the glowing shield for the moment as they both tried to make a plan.

“Man that thing is using its other rats like a flail.” Tech winced as he watched it slam against Astral’s shield.

“More like a friggin’ morningstar.” Astral winced as it impacted his shield again, it didn’t hurt but it took stamina to hold it after every hit. “I need to get him outside.” 

“Right, I can use Bessie’s rocket mode.” Tech advised.

Astral looked around to check what kind of building they were in and groaned. “Can’t, art show.” 

“Please tell me it wasn’t eating the art.” Tech sighed.

“You know rat spirits, they eat joy.” Astral grunted as his phone beeped, he slipped it out to see a text he dreaded more than the creature. “Oh.” Was all he could say.

“What?” Tech asked.

“Maxwell.” Astral said as a streak of white fur and blue cloth slammed into the Rat King and tore into its belly. 

The creature wailed as paintings poured out from its gut and its body shrunk. Then the two meter tall werewolf that was simply known as Maxwell slammed his staff into the ground and began chanting. 

“Restrain it!” Astral shouted as he cast the shield away and called the chains from earlier back to the Rat King’s.

Tech rolled away and changed the ammo back to the bolas and managed to tie the creature's arms up in a tangle of electrically chained shackles.

Astral held a focus on the chains, continuing to pour more words of binding into them to counter the creature’s enhanced strength. Tech just kept firing before he had to stop and reload a few times, but he never stopped until Maxwell did.  The Rat King roared as its body was compacted down into that of a single rat with the dead bodies of other rats glued to its tail, then it too finally died for good.

Maxwell stared at the dead creature and bowed his head and said a small prayer. Astral did much the same, but he didn’t have the same compassion for the beast that Maxwell clearly had. The werewolf then shifted back to his priestly human form. He was a wandering Shinto Monk, a sight so rare in the world that Astral was convinced that Maxwell was the only one left. 

In his human form Maxwell was a much shorter man, roughly only 175 Centimeters tall and not all that muscular, he bore a friendly smile and often leaned on his ritual staff. Maxwell was albino and often had an umbrella with him, though Astral didn’t see one at this time, he knew it was often just a comfort for the wandering monk.

“That was rough.” Maxwell smiled, “Thank you for the restraints.” 

“Bastard tanked a decently powered punch.” Astral grumbled, “Killed a man and sold off some corporate secrets, well almost did.” 

Maxwell nodded, “I just wonder what torment made this poor thing? Yokai don’t just appear.” 

“You consider it a yokai?” Astral blinked.

“Yes.” Maxwell walked over and blessed the corpses. “They were once living things, tormented into darkness. It is often the path that leads a creature to being a yokai and they needn’t always be alive to take it.” 

“I considered it a threat.” Astral shrugged, “Rat Kings weren’t uncommon in New York. Nastiness just happens there.”  

“Yes, but something had to torment this poor creature to make it this strong.” Maxwell countered.

“He’s right.” Tech spoke up, “Rat Kings feed on joy and pain. So someone had to be feeding that thing. And it was smart too.” 

Astral nodded, “Makes sense to me, but who would do that, what’s to gain?” 

“In this case, I believe it was Avarice...” Maxwell sighed, “...why risk one’s self in such exchanges when a minion of decent power and intelligence would suffice.” 

Astral frowned, “Poor little guys.” He bowed his head to the small furred mammals. “Rest in peace.” 

Maxwell smiled, “You always try to play so tough.” 

“Not playing at anything, I just didn’t have all the information.” Astral grumbled, “Threats can become victims, but I can’t make that decision without all the info.” He sighed, “Could it have been reasoned with, you think?” 

“No.” Maxwell shook his head, “You made the right call. It was too tormented, too twisted and blind to hope.” 

Astral nodded, “Well at least they can all rest now.” He looked around the room for a moment before spotting a small pocket liner that he picked up. “Well back to getting paid. You boys gonna be okay?” 

“It would be nice if you stayed for once.” Tech sighed, “But I get it, Were we sending the officers for questions?” 

“They can find me at home tomorrow.” Astral grinned as he stepped out and spread his wings and headed off to turn in the case to his employers.” 

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

That night Astral was finishing writing in his journal. It was a small thing he started directly after moving into the decently sized home he had acquired to let him and Ukiko keep some sort of protection for Ariane, the young girl they had both become attached to and who had become attached to them. They couldn’t adopt her due to an odd power she possessed to make all paperwork regarding her identity and guardianship vanish. Still they had been managing well for the month they’ve had as a weird little family.

Ukiko was a thought in his mind that he found hard to exercise on most occasions. She was smart, independent in every way and determined to do what she thought was right at any cost. She was a skilled and crafty lawyer who took her job seriously, and even if he was no longer technically a client, she had taken to defending him from the Church as a personal challenge that she was not backing down from.

Ariane was a bit of a different issue. The young girl was about 6 as far as anyone could tell. She was also a revenant, an undead being brought back to life for some purpose. Ariane’s purpose had been to find Astral and be a guide of sorts. As it turned out her patron was Yaweh, the Lord of Hosts and single deity of the Abrahamic faiths. The exact reasoning for Ariane’s status was still a mystery but the young girl was always enthusiastic and willing to protect her found family from their own moments of sadness. It was an enthusiasm that Astral could not keep up with at times. Thankfully they had managed to get the young girl into school via a homeschool option Ukiko had located.

Third in the strange little family was Lucifer Morningstar. The Fallen Angel had first presented himself as a mentor to Astral, and he still was by all accounts, but now he had wormed his way into their lives as an official “unofficial” uncle to Ariane. It didn’t hurt that he was also sworn to report the Archangels and to train Astral in the more combat based aspects of being a nephilim while also searching for the missing Yaweh. 

The newest addition to the odd family was Craig the Vegetarian Ōmukade that lived under the building. He was still technically a sore spot for Ariane who was deathly afraid of bugs, but she was slowly, very slowly, coming around to seeing Craig as a non-threat. Craig himself was a friendly and jovial sort, if non-confrontational and people pleasing. He was a good neighbor and friend.

Then there were the angels and their missions. For the angels, the first mission was finding Yaweh. He had vanished sometime during the Eleventh Century after making multiple Revenants at once. No angel would spare anything in their search for their Father and Lord. Their second mission was to prepare for a return of a great enemy, which also led to their third mission. They had to free all the nephilim from the Church, where they were little more than brainwashed slaves, a fate that Astral had been saved from by his weird little family.

For Astral though, the biggest issue that always found a way to creep into his head was the impending return of The Purge. The alien invaders were set to return and he had to be careful about who he told in order to avoid a panic. He hated that, he hated secrets, but he knew a panic would be an unrecoverable state and would be the end of them all.

As he finished recounting his day in the journal he stood up and walked out to the living room where Ariane was struggling to read a lesson book and Craig was also struggling to help her. Astral knew it wasn’t a language issue, so he walked over and looked at the cover. The book was on the Purge War and both Ariane and Craig were very gentle souls that were likely having trouble with the content of the lessons within. 

“All right.” Astral sighed, “Why are you studying such a sad point in history?” 

“Because it was on the lesson list.” Ariane sniffled. “Why did they do such horrible things?” 

Astral picked the girl up and carried her to a recliner he had bought, he sat down and put her on his lap. Then he opened the book and winced, the first pages were that of Tokyo, directly after its liberation, very few buildings of not had remained standing.

“Because, Ari, not everyone in this universe is good.” Astral sighed, “We want to believe that with all our hearts that everyone has the possibility of being good, but the purge cannot even try, for them to survive worlds must die.”

“Can’t there be other ways?” Ariane asked, tears pooling in her eyes.

“Many asked that question when they arrived. Some tried to reason with them, but in the end they chose elimination and consumption over everything else.” Craig craned over Astral’s head, “I was a hatchling then, my family moved to the United States afterward in an attempt to help our neighbors clean up and rebuild.” 

Ariane smiled at the giant centipede, “Good neighbors.” 

Craig clacked his mandibles in his way of smiling.  

“Just like daemons.” Astral sighed and winced, “So if they ever return, what do we do?” 

“Keep people safe.” Ariane raised her hand defiantly.

“Hide!” Craig hissed.

“Both are acceptable answers.” Astral smiled, “But there were good things that came from the time.” 

Ariane looked at Astral and smiled expectantly. 

“The first generation of heroes came out as a result. The supernatural started to just be a little more natural, but weird.” Astral grinned, “And we got some friendly aliens a bit later.” 

“The Rana!” Ariane nodded, “They lost to the same bad guys.” 

“Yeah, and now they’re a part of humanity.” Astral smiled, “Then we met the irresponsible guys.” 

Ariane tilted her head confused by the statement.

“See after the Rana came here, we eventually got visited by some space police who promptly freaked out when they learned we beat the purge.” Astral smirked.

“Technically they came before the Rana, but humanity told them to go away once they tried to make Earth a ‘wildlife’ preserve. Something about us not being a high enough civilization to participate in galactic politics.” Craig corrected his friend. “It just got worse when the Rana arrived, other Rana off world tried to claim Earth as a protectorate of their newly forming empire.” 

“Why?” Astral snorted, “Wait, no, let me guess. Military survivors using cloning.” 

“Close, Military and leading political parties.” Craig sighed, “They made the typical threats that if they came to Earth they would crush us.” 

“Please tell me we didn’t quote the Spartans.” Astral sighed and groaned.

“We did.” Craig snickered with a few clacks.

“What did the Spartans say?” Ariane asked.

“Well a long time ago the Spartans were warriors, pretty much the best. And some far off king made pretty much the same threat, ‘if we march on your city you will be destroyed.’ and the Spartan king sent a one word message back.” 

Ariane nodded and leaned forward. 

“If.” Astral said flatly, “What history tends to forget...” He looked at Ariane who was giggling and stopped. “You know what, time for lessons to stop.” He closed the lesson book. “Go play or something.” 

Ariane hopped down, “Can I go to the corner store and get some candy?” 

Astral looked around carefully and then at Craig before handing her a few yen notes. “Craig, can you go with her?” 

Craig nodded, “I need some cabbage for tonight anyway.” Astral watched as the centipede yokai’s body condensed and collapsed into a weird accordion shape and he became a humanoid with a centipede shaped head. It was a skill the yokai had put great effort into learning and it was one that was paying off. 

“Squishy Craig.” Ariane smiled.

“Yes, very.” Craig smiled as he held out a strangely human looking hand for Ariane. 

Ariane took the hand and waved to Astral as the two left for the corner store. Astral took the moment of silence to try and clear his own stressful thoughts, but that didn’t last long as a few moments later Ukiko walked in and screamed at the top of her lungs. Astral nearly tripped as he pitched himself out of his chair.  

“What, who?” Astral’s heart was beating like a jackhammer.

“Oh, no.” Ukiko sighed, “I thought you were out too. I saw Ari and Craig.” 

“Nope.” Astral laughed, “Just needed a moment.” 

“I feel that.” Ukiko looked around cautiously, “Quick sake?” 

Astral arched an eyebrow, but sighed and nodded, “Sounds like we’ve both had a day.” 

“I think this is the first time you’ve agreed to a drink.” Ukiko smiled as she went to a cupboard and unlocked it, pulling out a sake set which she immediately set about to heat the main bottle of. 

“What got you today?” Astral asked, “For me it was finally catching that friggin rat.”

“That’s good though.” Ukiko squinted.

“Turned out to be a Rat King, killed a man. A guard at the parking lot.” Astral sighed, “I didn’t even find the body until I was chasing the bastard.” 

“Even heroes can’t save everyone.” Ukiko smiled as she began to pour the drinks. “As for me, those lawyers from the Vatican finally started visiting again. They’re calling in reimbursement for your stipends. I don’t have a lot to work with on that, technically it is owed to be paid back. They could attempt to take the house.” 

“They won’t.” Astral nodded, “Threat tactic, besides I can pay it all back now. Been saving for just this play.” 

Ukiko blinked, “You’ve also been spending pretty well.” 

Astral shrugged, “Private investigation pays well. Like ludicrously well, if you know what to look into. In my case busting yokai and spirits on industrial espionage, still can't believe I’m saying that, pays a lot.” He chuckled as he drank from the cup Ukiko had poured for him. He coughed and balked for a moment.

“You okay?” Ukiko asked, “You and alcohol really don’t agree with each other.” 

Astral shrugged, “I will admit, liquor tends to agree more, but that also is something I try to avoid. Addictive personality and all.” 

“I can always keep you on the wagon if you’d like.” Ukiko smiled and sipped her drink. “Also you’re supposed to sip sake.” 

“Oops.” Astral smiled, “Well, that’s not how that phrase goes anyway. The Wagon is sobriety, which you have clearly worked against tonight.” 

Soon he was sipping his second cup and finding it much better than the first. Ukiko was putting the rest away as she too was on her second cup. During that time Ariane and Craig walked back in with Ariane holding multiple small plush creatures.

“Candy?” Astral laughed. 

“The crane machine called to me!” Ariane whimpered, “They needed homes.” 

Ukiko laughed and nodded as she finished her drink, “So you got more stuffed friends for Teddy then. Ok, let's put them up.” 

She walked around the counter and tripped forward only for Astral to catch her and spin off the tall chair that he had been sitting at. He had to grab the counter to hold them both up and they were positioned perilously close to each other’s faces.

“Do you think they’ll kiss?” Ariane whispered to Craig.

“I’ll get her to her room!” Craig chirped and rushed the young girl off.

Astral pulled the both of them back upwards and dusted off Ukiko’s shoulders nervously. She straightened her hair and cleared her throat.

“Thank you.” She bowed her head. “I’ll see to Ari’s bed time.”

“Probably...” Astral nodded. “...probably a good idea. Gonna go crash, want to get up early enough to take her for a morning walk.” 

“Sounds...” Ukiko blinked. “Sounds good.” She quickly dashed off to Ariane’s room.

Astral smacked his own face lightly then he went to his room and fell face first into his pillow and silently screamed into the cushion. He made a small prayer for something, anything to shatter the awkwardness that was continuing between himself and Ukiko. It would be a prayer he would soon regret.

I will also attach my Daylio for this month to show trends. I started February 19th, 5mg for one week and then 10mg since. This is my second time on lexapro...first time I was on it for about 8 years at 10mg. Worked so great, but got sick last November and quit cold turkey (I wasn't in my right mind).
Three weeks in this time was my worst week. Last week started a really positive trend: mornings got better, I was able to start drinking a little more coffee, sleep is getting better, and I'm feeling closer and closer like myself. I am happy with the progression so far, and still know there's plenty more room and time to get better. 
That being said, yesterday humbled me. It started out good, but by the afternoon I started feeling a little off. Then, a little after 3pm, I had a pretty gnarly panic attack, which I hadn't had in quite awhile. Hydroxyzine calmed me down eventually (I hadnt had to use it during the day since last Thursday), but still felt a little off the rest of the evening and into this morning currently (anxiety had me jumping out of bed this morning, and now a little more restless and jittery than I have been the past week). So I'm trying to grasp at what could be causing this change. 
I know some people have a rough week or two right before leveling out. Again, 3 weeks in was a rough week, and now this is just over 5 weeks in. I've also had a few things going on....my son got his learner's permit yesterday, and going to the dmv may have triggered something. I'm also stressed about the fires in NC and SC (I'm in East Tn). It's also allergy season here, and that may have me feeling off. 
And then, finally, there's the fact that my boob's have been sore since Tuesday (I had a hysterectomy 12 years ago, but still have my ovaries), so maybe it's a hormone fluctuation causing this anxiety. 
So I'm just looking for a little advice to help me get through this dip. Did anyone have a rough patch around 5-6 weeks? Do hormonal fluctuations cause increased anxiety during this start-up time? Thank you all so much ❤️ ",4,1743081181.0,lexapro,2,1.0,False

In recent years, kitchen spaces have increasingly been viewed not just as utilitarian areas for meal preparation but as integral components of domestic architecture. Contemporary design trends emphasize spatial efficiency, integrated technology, and minimalist aesthetics. A significant influence on this transformation has been the European approach to kitchen design, particularly in the implementation of open layouts and material restraint.

The concept of luxury in this context is more aligned with precision, quality of materials, and ergonomic planning than with ornamental features. European kitchen design, notably from German and Scandinavian origins, prioritizes function without compromising visual coherence. This model has informed design preferences globally, encouraging a move away from traditional, compartmentalized kitchens.

This article provides a focused analysis of how European design philosophies have contributed to redefining the luxury kitchen. It addresses philosophical underpinnings, material selections, spatial planning, technological integrations, and customization. The goal is to clarify why these influences have become central to the modern understanding of luxury in kitchen environments.

# Philosophical Underpinnings of European Kitchen Design

European kitchen design draws heavily from early 20th-century modernist movements, particularly the Bauhaus school. The guiding principle—form follows function—remains relevant. In this framework, aesthetic choices are subordinate to utility, resulting in environments that are both visually coherent and practically optimized.

The concept of ""Gesamtkunstwerk"" or ""total work of art"" underlines the holistic approach taken in European kitchens. This idea mandates that each component—be it cabinetry, fixtures, or lighting—functions as part of a unified whole. Accordingly, designs often feature built-in appliances and concealed storage that reduce visual clutter and increase usability.

This approach leads to a rational organization of space. Design decisions prioritize workflow and longevity, supporting a more intuitive user experience. Philosophically, it aligns with broader European tendencies toward sustainability and moderation in consumer habits, further reinforcing its relevance.

# Materials and Textures: The European Palette

Material selection in European kitchens reflects an emphasis on durability, sustainability, and aesthetic neutrality. Common choices include engineered stone, ceramic composites, and treated wood varieties such as oak and walnut. These materials are favored for their tactile qualities and subdued appearance.

The use of matte finishes and restrained color palettes reinforces the understated elegance typical of European interiors. Metals such as brushed steel and anodized aluminum are often used for hardware and trim, providing subtle contrasts without visual excess. Glass elements are incorporated sparingly to enhance light diffusion and openness.

This material vocabulary is not chosen for superficial reasons. Instead, it reflects a commitment to ecological responsibility and lifecycle performance. Many manufacturers adhere to environmental standards and use recyclable components, indicating that the aesthetic coherence is matched by a systemic design integrity.

# Spatial Dynamics and the Open Kitchen Concept

A notable contribution of European design is the integration of kitchens into the broader architectural context of the home. The removal of internal barriers has facilitated more flexible and interactive domestic environments. This has shifted kitchens from isolated work zones to central hubs for communal activity.

The design logic typically follows spatial zoning, wherein different activities—cooking, eating, socializing—are accommodated within a continuous layout. Islands and peninsulas often serve as transitional elements, delineating functional areas while maintaining spatial fluidity. This organization enhances usability and encourages social engagement.

Spatial efficiency is further optimized through considered ergonomics. Work triangles are minimized, and circulation paths are calculated with precision. Custom storage elements, such as deep drawers and rotating shelves, maximize capacity in constrained layouts. Lighting design follows a layered approach, employing task, ambient, and accent lighting to define zones and support usability.

# Technological Integration and Smart Functionality

Technology in European kitchens is deployed not for spectacle but for operational enhancement. Built-in appliances are prevalent, with integration intended to preserve the visual unity of the space. Equipment is often flush-mounted or concealed behind cabinetry to reduce interruption in the design narrative.

Smart appliances are increasingly common. These include induction cooktops, networked ovens, and automated ventilation systems. Control interfaces are designed for simplicity and often integrate with broader home automation systems. Despite the technological complexity, the user experience remains central to system design.

Air management and climate control systems are also embedded in cabinetry and ceiling structures. These features contribute to environmental comfort and support the open-plan arrangement by reducing sensory disruptions. Overall, the use of technology in these kitchens is utilitarian and discreet.

# Customization and Personalization in Layout and Use

European luxury kitchens are not prescriptive. Instead, they are designed to accommodate user-specific requirements. Manufacturers offer modular systems that allow for extensive customization in both form and function. This ensures that the kitchen can be tailored to diverse usage patterns and spatial constraints.

Customization options include variable countertop heights, modular cabinetry configurations, and appliance placement flexibility. Users can specify material and color combinations that align with personal preferences while maintaining overall design coherence. These modifications allow for individual expression within a standardized design language.

Additional zones for niche activities—such as baking, coffee preparation, or entertaining—can be incorporated without disrupting the visual or functional unity of the space. These secondary features enhance the kitchen’s versatility while preserving its formal discipline.

# How German Kitchens Exemplify European Design Excellence

German kitchens represent a high standard of execution within the broader European context. Their emphasis on precision engineering, modular design, and build quality has set industry benchmarks. These kitchens integrate seamlessly into architectural spaces and are noted for their material consistency and structural durability.

The design characteristics of [German kitchens](https://www.leichtca.com/kitchens) include frameless cabinetry, ergonomic work surfaces, and innovative storage solutions. Soft-close mechanisms and concealed hinges are standard, reflecting a focus on silent and efficient operation. Layouts prioritize symmetry and accessibility, further enhancing user interaction.

Materially, German kitchens often employ a combination of wood veneers, laminate composites, and metal accents. The visual language is restrained, relying on clean lines and subtle contrasts. This design rigor reflects a cultural emphasis on quality and long-term value, making German kitchens a strong exemplar of European luxury.

# The Contemporary Definition of a Modern Luxury Kitchen

The term [modern luxury kitchen](https://www.leichtca.com/projects) no longer connotes ostentation or excess. Instead, it refers to spaces that are intelligently designed, materially consistent, and technically sophisticated. The European model has played a significant role in shaping this revised definition.

Current standards for luxury emphasize practicality, coherence, and adaptability. A kitchen that aligns with these criteria supports varied use cases, minimizes waste, and complements the larger domestic environment. European kitchens, through their emphasis on modularity and integration, exemplify these values.

This shift also corresponds with broader social attitudes favoring mindful consumption and responsible design. Consumers increasingly seek spaces that perform well over time and support sustainable lifestyles. European kitchens, with their measured approach to form and function, are aligned with these emerging expectations.

# Conclusion: Embracing the Essential Elegance of European Kitchens

The influence of European design on modern kitchens is both significant and instructive. It demonstrates that luxury is not dependent on ornamentation but can emerge from the consistent application of sound design principles. This includes the integration of space, material, and technology into a cohesive whole.

As the definition of domestic luxury continues to evolve, European kitchens offer a viable model grounded in practicality, aesthetics, and sustainability. They are not merely trend-driven showpieces but long-term investments in quality of life and architectural coherence. For those engaged in kitchen planning or renovation, the European approach remains a compelling standard to consider.",1,1743080851.0,ModernLuxuryKitchen,0,1.0,False

This might be more of a rant although I do need some advice (my mom likes to get in my head, you'll soon see the tip of the iceberg as to why I have issues with her). I have my daughters 2 year old birthday party coming up and had everything under control (decorations, catering, even on theme ice cubes for beverages and kids goodie bags, etc) for drink options I have a themed punch and pink lemonade as well as champagne for those who might want to add it to their drink, beer and coffee. My mom is insisting it's rude that I don't have wine (this is mainly for her but she's spinning it as if it's for everyone else too).  I know she's doing this because she can't stand when I don't need her for help or have everything be about her needs. I'm not a drinker, I'm currently pregnant and have a few other pregnant ladies coming and this is a kids birthday party at 1pm on a Sunday for 2 hrs.... is booze even necessary for a child's birthday?  Especially with a party at 1pm on a Sunday. 

Second dilemma regarding my mom again, surprise surprise.  My nephews birthday is a month before my daughters and my mom insisted I offer to bring something to their party. Mind you, this was another themed event where I got the invitation in the mail, etc. I thought it was weird to offer to bring something to someone else's kids party that they planned and have a theme, etc? Ive been to lots of kids parties for my son and no one has offered to bring food nor have I.

 (Not to mention, I have two kids, work full time, currently pregnant and my husband is always working so I'm alone most of the time and technically live out of state (about an hour away from them though)). 

So now with my daughters party, my mom put my SIL up to asking me if she should bring anything. I simply so no but thank you we are covered.  My mom now keeps asking and I'll tell her no and she'll try to spin it another way to see if I take her up on it. I know she's trying to get her way and see if I cave to accept others help as payback for not offering to bring food last month however I find this SO ODD. This is not a BBQ/potluck/family dinner, etc. 

Am I wrong here thinking this is just about her getting her way? I always offer and bring food for any other event except ones like this where I don't think it's necessary... to me this would be like asking if I should bring food to a wedding.

Day 1
Training: Crystal hunting - get some energy for the coming week and increase aerobic capacity. End the day by reading some SciFi novels to get inspiration for naming FA boulders.
Nutrition: Blunt to relax and coffee to get psyched

Day 2
Training: Limit Outdoor projects- all day. 
Nutrition: Ciggy and Coffee - get you wired for the board session - nicotine is a neutropic after all. Blunt to relax after the session. 

Day 3
Training: Limit  Outdoor projects - all day baby. Go to bed with knee pads taped and glued on. Hopefully this'll get me used to them being nice and tight for the projects.
Nutrition: Pancakes in the morning for the carbs,  pre session ciggy to keep concentration optimal, then recovery beers. 

Day 4
Training: Limit Outdoor projecting - all day. End the day with some DJing to loosen up the limbs and keep me flexible for the projects. 
Nutrition: rinse and repeat. Make sure have enough recovery beers , hydration is key.

1jl3dyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1jl3dyc/aita_for_destroying_my_perfect_relationship_and/,AITA for destroying my perfect relationship and breaking the heart of the kindest man I've ever known?,"I've been sitting in my car for the past two hours, sobbing so hard I can barely see straight, and I know I deserve every second of this pain. Three weeks ago, I had everything – a loving boyfriend of four years who treated me like gold, a beautiful apartment we'd just signed a lease on together, and wedding plans on the horizon. Today, I have nothing but regret and the knowledge that I single-handedly destroyed it all.

My boyfriend (now ex) was genuinely the most thoughtful, caring person I've ever met. He remembered every anniversary, brought me soup when I was sick, and drove two hours to surprise me at work on my birthday with flowers. He got along with my awful family, tolerated my mood swings, and made me laugh even on my darkest days. This man was planning to propose next month during our vacation – I found the ring receipt in his email when I was looking for our flight confirmation. That's what makes what I did so much worse.

It started at a work conference in Miami. My coworker, who I'd always found attractive but never thought anything would happen with, was there too. We ended up drinking at the hotel bar after everyone else had gone to bed. One drink turned into five, and I convinced myself that harmless flirting wasn't really cheating. When he suggested going up to his room, some stupid part of my brain decided that what happens at conferences stays at conferences.

It wasn't even good. The whole time I felt sick with guilt, but I didn't stop. The next morning, I woke up hating myself but told myself it was a one-time mistake that my boyfriend would never need to know about.

Except my coworker started texting me constantly when we got back. He showed up at my office with coffee. He kept making comments about ""our little secret"" within earshot of other colleagues. I should have shut it down immediately, but I was terrified he'd tell everyone, including my boyfriend, if I rejected him outright.

Then last week, my boyfriend picked me up from work unexpectedly. He saw my coworker hand me a note, and later found it in my coat pocket. It wasn't explicit, but it was obviously inappropriate. Instead of screaming or throwing things, my boyfriend just sat me down and asked, with tears in his eyes, ""Is there something I should know?""

I broke down and confessed everything. The look on his face destroyed me. He didn't yell. He didn't call me names. He just said, very quietly, ""I thought you were my forever person,"" packed an overnight bag, and left.

I've called, texted, and even gone to his friends' places looking for him. Yesterday, his sister told me he's staying with their parents and asked me to stop contacting him. She also told me he'd already called our landlord and paid the fee to break our lease.

My friends are split – half say I made a terrible mistake but should fight for him, the others say I need to accept it's over and let him heal. My coworker is still texting me like we're going to start dating now. I've blocked his number, but the damage is done.

I know I'm the asshole here. I guess what I'm asking is... is there any coming back from this? Has anyone ever rebuilt trust after such a terrible betrayal? Or should I just accept that I ruined the best thing in my life because I was too selfish and stupid to appreciate what I had?",1,1743080525.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

1jl3dlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ObjectiveAlarming933/comments/1jl3dlc/abracadabra/,Abracadabra,"I couldn’t sleep. I was having a nonsense dream. Except for this one weird part where I was in my parent’s bedroom suddenly and the house was being surrounded with water. My parent’s bedroom was becoming submerged. A man was in my parent’s bed and he said “come on!!! Let’s pull it out of the water”. In order to pull it out of the water, the man had to convince me to get into the bed, lock arms with him and then pull our arms up. I thought that was ridiculous so I didn’t do it… even though I knew he was right somehow. 
And then I woke up. 

I tried to go back to sleep but my back hurt from laying in bed so I just got up. Blueberry greeted me and lead me to his feeding station. I figured,”I’m not doing anything else” so I sat on the floor and brushed him while he ate. The last few weeks, my mission has been to remove blueberry’s mats. It’s been a whole ordeal here. But we are getting close to being mat free. The next step is to maintain the health of his fur. He really enjoyed spending time with me and having his fur brushed. I got a lot of shit too. I’m hoping we can keep this up so he doesn’t get anymore mats.

After I brushed blueberry. I made coffee and then it dawned on me. It was like a jolt of electricity. My partner is sick. He had a fever when he went to bed. He was already clammy when he got to bed- which means I need to wash the sheets when he gets up because he gets soooo sweaty when he has cellulitis. But something else that happens when he gets sick is he gets really fucking loopy. Like, he’s not here at all. When he’s not sick, he’s a little bit here. Not a ton. But when he’s sick, he’s confused and not everything that he does or says makes sense. This information is helpful for me because it will help me have more compassion. It’s also a reminder that this is not a regular relationship. He’s really sick. He is really really sick. 

Last night when I blurted out how challenging this is for me, his response was “I’m sorry” and then he left. And I think that’s the most appropriate response he could muster in his fevered state. I think it was the most understanding he could provide. It’s hard because the people who surround us haven’t seen his decline. We only see people for a couple hours in a week or month. No one understands. And I want people to understand. But I don’t think they can. I think and feel that I am dealing with this alone. 

I can feel myself hardening to him and this situation. That’s not what I want and that is not what he needs. He needs my kindness and compassion. 

I can be affectionate with him but I’m afraid he will still consider us romantic partners and I need that definition to change. For my own sanity. For my own fulfillment. For my own satisfaction. But we are a ways away from that. I don’t know if I can do it. I don’t know if I can tell him that I can’t be romantic with him anymore. I don’t even know how much of it he will grasp in his state. He’s getting infections every 2-3 months. Just as soon as one begins to clear up, the next begins. 

So yeah. Of course I’m doing some of the things that I am doing. Im glad that I’m not drinking. I’m glad that I don’t want to drink. 

This is really hard. 
I’m having a hard time. 

I miss having sex and having a partner that engages in conversation. I miss doing life with someone. I am lonely. I’m tired. And I’m burnt out. 

I keep daydreaming about the concert. It’s something to look forward to. After the show, I’m going to get a hotel room with my best friend who will be visiting Portland for the week.
After her visit, I think I will start planning a trip to powell’s books. Last night I loosely started looking into renting a cabin. Finding a whale watching tour. That’s super expensive and it would be an ordeal. But I think it’s worth working towards. Getting a bed is something else I am looking forward to. These are things that i lean on really hard when this shit gets unbearable. 

It’s been really nice talking to other. I’ve always enjoyed conversations with him. We’ve kept the conversation light. I think that’s good. I think it’s okay to keep an open conversation going. At first I was a little hesitant but he has a lot going on and doesn’t seem bothered by long breaks in the conversation. It doesn’t bother me either. It’s a nice little surprise to get a message from him randomly in the day. 

I’m going to dig deeper into crochet. I promised myself that I would come out of this experience with a mastery in crochet and I am still really committed to that. One thing that I love about my current project is that I can enter a flow state because I know the original African Violet Motif so well from practicing it over and over again. My weakness is that I know it so well, I made an error on the triangular motif last night. The triangular motifs will be vastly different than the other shapes. I need to follow those patterns step by step instead of just cranking my motor and going going going. This project is called a “stash buster”. It means you can use up scrap yarn in order to assemble it, which is awesome for me. I need to use this yarn. Next I need to use my surplus of chenille yarn. I don’t know how much I want to use it in the future. I will say that my impulse buying of yarn has helped me gain a better understanding of the different fibers and how they work when stitched and what types of projects they will be good for. 

So the other day when I was listening to the intro of that book by the ninja Christian white guy… he talked about the Latin meaning of the word “ Abra Cadabra”. It literally translates to “I create with my words”. And I really fell in love with that tidbit. I’ve been thinking about that a lot because the word was adopted by magicians. Magic. Words are magical and powerful and they can create or destroy depending on my intention. (I feel stupid talking about this when I blurted something that I wish I could take back last night. I do really good otherwise. I was having a rough night. The cat broke me down. lol.) when I was growing up, my parents really drilled into my words because I guess I am direct in a way that is not always great for other people. My brother is too. When my parents got divorced my brother adamantly told my mother she was making a mistake and he was severely abused and rejected because of that. My father pulled me aside more times than I can count to tell me that my words were hurtful- even if they were true. That’s something, isn’t it? We should tell the truth, but only about our own shortcomings. Never point out someone else’s shortcomings. Unless they ask. And my intentions have to be pure too.

Spewing of magic, all of the witchy books I put in the apartment library are gone. I knew they wouldn’t last long. The first ones I put in the library were nabbed in less than an hour. 
The only book that remains is one that I had to struggle to find. I can’t remember where I finally found it. It’s called “Jesus and the goddess”. I don’t remember a lot about the book, but I do remember the conversation I had with the author after I read it. I asked her about different issues I have had with my own generalized faith. I think I eventually exhausted her because finally she asked “does it bring you peace? If so, it’s probably the right direction for you”. The conversation was really meaningful to me. She is a reverend of some kind. She first was a minister in a Christian chapter of faith and then moved in the direction of goddess beliefs. I can’t remember a thing outside of that. 

Compassion. Faith. Peace. Kindness. Serenity. 
I can create these things within my home with my words. 

Abra Cadabra.

So my (M23) ex (F22) who I now believe to have undiagnosed BPD after 1.5 years together decided to cheat on me and dump me 2 weeks ago seemingly out of nowhere. At first it was the most painful thing I had experienced, but after a solid break from dealing with her in person it’s starting to hit me how abnormal the relationship was. When we first met things moved pretty fast and we official within a month of meeting, I loved her she seemingly loved me, things were intense and she seemed so sweet and innocent at first but the way she idealised me fed my ego, posting instagram stories and tic tics calling me handsome and comparing me to celebrities, and made me almost addicted to her. I did find her highly attractive and things were good in bed too however pretty early on it was clear there were red flags which I should not have ignored.  Within the first couple months I remember one morning she woke up and kicked me out the house because “my presence made it impossible for her to pee” to which I left and forgot about it. She shortly after revealed she had previously been hospitalised for psychosis and never truly recovered. She has been quite dysfunctional since, struggling to hold any job and being unable to do her uni work on her own. After the first 6 months or so her true self begun to slowly reveal itself. There would be occasional explosive outburst of anger for seemingly no reason maybe a sarcastic comment that would be taken way too personally. As time went on this became more frequent. She also had issues making friends she didn’t really seem to have any close friends and was avoiding meeting my own friends and family despite me meeting and getting along well with her family (they were lovely btw, her mum even wanted us to live together full time). I remember the first time I started to question the longevity of the relationship was when I woke up one morning to a really loud bang that caused me to wake up in a state of shock, she had thrown her fan (over a metre tall) across the room at the wall out of nowhere just after waking up, to this day I still don’t know why as I was asleep leading up to this. As time went on the explosive outbursts worsened to the point she would shout at me publicly one that stuck in my memory was her screaming at me in a grocery store near the counter because I waited outside for her (she wanted to get some alcohol, I had forgotten my ID) but after 5 minutes and her not coming out I went in to check everything was ok and that’s when she exploded at me, the way everyone in the store looked at me with concern still sticks in my memory. Another time we had woken up late and I had to leave in a rush to get ready for work, she had been making a coffee I had assumed for herself and as I said goodbye to her she got angry and smacked the glass off the counter, slammed the door on me and screamed “F*** off then”. She became more needy over time, wanting me to stay more and more with her but refusing to ever come round mine, which drove a wedge between my family and friends because I was spending less and less time with them but more time with her, basically sacrificing my own life for her needs. She was deeply insecure would always say she feels like shes not good enough for me, questioning me frequently asking “why do you love me”. Towards the end especially the last month she became more distant, but still said she loved me, 3 weeks before ending things we even booked to go on holiday in the summer with her family and paid for the flights, she was even excited to have “hotel sex” then 2 weeks later she started hiding her phone from me and pulling strange faces (guilty face I suppose), I knew she was hiding something but I just accepted it was going to end soon, that Saturday she dumped me by text saying she no longer feels a connection and that she doesn’t want a relationship anymore, after calling her it was revealed she had been meeting with this over guy and that she had indeed cheated before ending things. It was hard at first, the same day she broke up with me she said she misses me and asked me to come to a restaurant with her and her mum. I declined, she text me to say she’s sorry and she hates herself and that I deserve better, and tried ringing me a few times throughout the week but I didn’t answer as I was done. Decided to establish no contact a week ago and she’s still sending me songs that remind her of me despite her seeing this other dude. At first I was heartbroken and questioning what went wrong or what I should have done better, but after 2 weeks to process things I also feel a sense of relief, knowing I really did the best I could for have for her which is why it probably lasted so long despite her flaws, but also seeing more clearly how little she sacrificed for me. She was just a deeply miserable person who hated herself and will self sabotage anything good for her eventually. Sorry for the long post just needed to vent on the experience that has been the last 1.5 years of my life dating who I believe to be an undiagnosed pwBPD. I’m not the crazy one right? 

So my (M23) ex (F22) who I now believe to have undiagnosed BPD after 1.5 years together decided to cheat on me and dump me 2 weeks ago seemingly out of nowhere. At first it was the most painful thing I had experienced, but after a solid break from dealing with her in person it’s starting to hit me how abnormal the relationship was. When we first met things moved pretty fast and we official within a month of meeting, I loved her she seemingly loved me, things were intense and she seemed so sweet and innocent at first but the way she idealised me fed my ego, posting instagram stories and tic tics calling me handsome and comparing me to celebrities, and made me almost addicted to her. I did find her highly attractive and things were good in bed too however pretty early on it was clear there were red flags which I should not have ignored.  Within the first couple months I remember one morning she woke up and kicked me out the house because “my presence made it impossible for her to pee” to which I left and forgot about it. She shortly after revealed she had previously been hospitalised for psychosis and never truly recovered. She has been quite dysfunctional since, struggling to hold any job and being unable to do her uni work on her own. After the first 6 months or so her true self begun to slowly reveal itself. There would be occasional explosive outburst of anger for seemingly no reason maybe a sarcastic comment that would be taken way too personally. As time went on this became more frequent.

1jl3d3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jl3d3j/custom_embroidery_service/,Custom Embroidery Service,"Alright, let’s dive into this exciting venture of yours! Picture this: You’re sitting at your kitchen table, a calming cup of coffee by your side, and a shiny new embroidery machine humming softly in the background like a proud puppy waiting for a treat. That’s your future right there, my friend. Custom embroidery is more than just stitching; it’s a way to infuse personality into everyday items.

First up, let’s brainstorm some ideas. Hats? Absolutely! Think quirky phrases like “Mommy’s Little Explorer” or “Adventure Awaits” – perfect for toddlers who are already living their best lives. And let’s not forget about jackets! Whether it’s a vintage denim jacket or a sporty bomber, imagine them adorned with little badges or personalized names. Anything that turns a basic piece into a cherished memory is a winner in my book. 

Now, baby clothes…oh, the possibilities! Adorable little onesies with playful motifs or heartfelt messages like “I’m the reason we’re always late.” That one’s sure to get a chuckle. Parents are always on the lookout for unique pieces that tell stories, and you can be the storyteller with a needle and thread.

As for investing in that embroidery machine… consider it your creative sidekick. Don’t go for the industrial beast right away; something compact yet powerful can do wonders without overpowering your space. You don’t want to feel like you're wrestling with a robotic octopus every time you need a new design.

Now, let’s talk marketing. Think local at first. Farmers’ markets, craft fairs, or local boutiques can be perfect places to showcase your crafty magic. Connect with your community. You can even host small workshops to teach others the basics. Imagine gathering a bunch of eager learners around, everyone laughing and sharing stories while creating their own masterpieces. Those connections build trust and brand loyalty better than any ad campaign out there.

And then there’s Etsy, the online treasure trove waiting for your spark. Craft an engaging shop description that feels like a warm chat over coffee. Use high-quality photos that capture the vibrancy of your work, and sprinkle in heartfelt stories behind each piece. Remember, people buy with their hearts, not just their wallets. Share your journey. Highlight how your products can be that special gift for a baby shower or a unique way to celebrate a birthday.

In this process, embrace the shifts and turns—after all, just like any good story, this journey has its highs and lows. Lean into those moments of vulnerability, share your victories, and invite your audience on this beautiful ride with you. Who knows, this little embroidery dream could blossom into an incredible community of supporters and customers all cheering each other on.

So, roll up those sleeves, dust off that sewing machine, and get ready to stitch some unforgettable stories onto hats, jackets, and onesies. You're not just creating products; you're crafting little pieces of joy for folks to hold onto. And that’s something worth every stitch.",1,1743080467.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

These figures showcase amazing possibilities for future business owners.

This piece will help you discover proven small business ideas that work in 2025. You'll learn about three traditional business models and their challenges. We'll also reveal why telehealth stands out as one of the most promising chances for entrepreneurs. Our insights will guide you to find the right path, whether you want a side hustle or a full-time business venture.

***Strategic Guidelines: For top small business ideas, scroll to the bottom.***

# Key Takeaways

* **Shift to Digital & Home-Based Models:**A significant portion of U.S. businesses now operate from home, fueled by online platforms and digital entrepreneurship.
* **Diverse Opportunities Across Sectors:**Promising ventures include online businesses (dropshipping, content creation), service-based models (virtual assistance, personal care), and product-focused enterprises.
* **Challenges in Traditional Models:**Traditional ventures like coffee shops, e-commerce stores, and wellness studios face issues such as high operating costs, fierce competition, and regulatory hurdles.
* **Telehealth's Rapid Growth:**Telehealth stands out due to its projected market boom, lower costs compared to in-person care, and increasing insurance coverage, making it a top small business opportunity.
* **Support Through Digital Health Platforms:**Platforms like Bask Health offer essential digital tools and expert guidance to help entrepreneurs successfully launch and scale telehealth services.

# Popular Small Business Ideas in 2025

Small business opportunities have changed a lot, and entrepreneurs now have many paths to success. Let's look at the most promising ventures in various business models.

# Online and digital business opportunities

Digital entrepreneurship continues to thrive, and online businesses are projected to generate substantial revenue. The [AI market alone is expected to reach USD 826.70 billion by 2030](https://www.shopify.com/blog/online-business-ideas). New entrepreneurs find dropshipping a budget-friendly option that lets them source pre-existing products without managing inventory directly.

Content creation services have become a lucrative opportunity. Creators can monetize their skills through multiple revenue streams, from freelance writing to podcast production. On top of that, the influencer marketing industry will reach USD 22.00 billion, creating new paths for social media entrepreneurs.

# Service-based business models

Service businesses offer remarkable advantages because of their low startup costs and flexibility. Personal services, from fitness training to skincare, show strong customer demand. Plus, business support services like virtual assistance and consulting let entrepreneurs work remotely.

Growing businesses just need expert leadership without full-time commitments, making fractional C-suite services increasingly popular. Specialized services like translation and accounting keep steady market demand and offer stable income potential.

# Product-based ventures

Product-based businesses remain viable with a strategic approach, despite the digital move. Successful product entrepreneurs share common traits: they value community support, understand their work's importance, and know that sustainable growth takes time.

Product success depends on getting the full picture of [market validation and customer engagement](https://bask.health/blog/starting-a-telemedicine-business). Research shows that 80-90% of products launched in the US fail. All the same, entrepreneurs can find success when they:

* Start small and focus locally
* Perfect their formula through direct customer feedback
* Build strong relationships with wholesale accounts
* Maintain product quality while scaling operations

Some of the best-selling products were created years ago, and their success came from constant refinement and customer feedback integration. This shows that patience and persistence often bring better results than rushing to market.

These business models show that 2025's most profitable ventures match high-demand markets. This lets entrepreneurs focus on delivering value instead of convincing people to buy. Small businesses succeed when they solve real problems and meet genuine market needs.

# Three Traditional Business Models and Their Hidden Challenges

Business owners often discover hidden operational challenges only after they're deep into their ventures. Let's get into three common business models and learn about what makes them tough to run.

# Coffee Shop: Community appeal vs. operational realities

Running a coffee shop looks simple, but it's far from easy. Staff costs eat up 35-45% of margins, which makes managing your team vital. Baristas tend to change jobs frequently, so you need constant training. This affects how consistent your service can be.

Picking the right spot is a game-changer. Most customers pick their coffee shop based on what's close by, not brand loyalty. A great location comes with its problems - rent takes 10-15% of what you make. Successful shops need to handle [supply chain complexities](https://bask.health/blog/understanding-the-fda-shortlist) and keep their coffee quality steady even when growing conditions change.

# E-Commerce Store: Low barriers but fierce competition

E-commerce might be easier to start, but the competition is brutal. Local shops find it hard to match big online stores' convenience and product range. Marketing costs can spiral out of control when you're trying to stand out against bigger retailers who've been around longer.

You'll spend more than just running a website. Managing inventory, shipping, and customer support needs serious money. Your digital strategy needs constant updates because online shoppers change their priorities faster than ever.

# Health & Wellness Studio: High demand with regulatory hurdles

The FDA keeps a close eye on health and wellness studios. You need to watch every health claim you make. Even basic wellness products might need special approval if they promise specific health benefits.

Starting costs are steep - you need equipment, expert staff, and facility upkeep. Studios must find ways to stand out while following [regulatory compliance](https://bask.health/blog/meet-compliance-regulations). Lawyers love to target wellness businesses, so proper paperwork and risk management are a must.

# Why Telehealth Is the Most Profitable Small Business Idea Today

Telehealth will be a profitable venture in 2025. Market data and growing opportunities back this claim. Let's get into why this sector is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs.

# Market growth statistics and future projections

The [global telehealth market](https://bask.health/blog/healthcare-tech-investments) was worth USD 101.15 billion in 2023. It will grow at a CAGR of 24.3% through 2030. More smartphones, smooth internet connectivity, and strong government support drive this growth. The market could reach USD 286.22 billion by 2030. This shows huge potential for new businesses.

# Lower overhead compared to traditional healthcare

Telehealth costs much less than conventional medical practices. A telehealth visit typically costs USD 40-50, while in-person acute care costs USD 136-176. The results are impressive - 83% of patients solve their issues in one visit. This leads to lower operating costs through:

* Minimal facility requirements
* Lower staffing needs
* Decreased administrative costs
* Reduced equipment investments

# Expanding insurance coverage for telehealth services

[Insurance coverage for telehealth services](https://bask.health/blog/navigating-insurance-and-billing-challenges) is growing steadily. Currently, 43 states require private insurance to cover telehealth services. Medicare coverage now extends through March 31, 2025. Patients can receive care from anywhere in the U.S..

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved new Remote Therapeutic Codes. This gives providers more billing options. Healthcare organizations using telehealth report major benefits:

* 36% reduction in emergency department visits
* 17% lower costs compared to traditional care
* Better patient engagement and medication adherence

These numbers show why telehealth is ideal for entrepreneurs seeking profitable ventures. Market growth, lower operational costs, and better insurance coverage create an unprecedented chance in healthcare.

# Conclusion

Business opportunities in 2025 include digital ventures, service-based companies, and product-focused enterprises. Coffee shops, e-commerce stores, and wellness studios remain viable options. These traditional businesses face major operational hurdles and tough competition.

Telehealth stands out as the best opportunity right now. Market projections and wider insurance coverage strongly support this outlook. The sector will reach [USD 286.22 billion by 2030](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/55-small-business-ideas-for-2025). Lower operational costs make it an excellent choice for entrepreneurs who want lasting success.

Smart business owners should review their options carefully. Successful ventures in 2025 will blend digital innovation with core services - an area where [telehealth](https://bask.health/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-telehealth) shines.

Every single time. I got six coffees, 2 donuts, 100 points and a $25 ""grift"" card for SkullCandy.

So ignore the urge to roll and kill that desire  for instant gratification. Once it's over and no one is rolling anymore, prizes are still left in the pool - A LOT of them.

At first it was the most painful thing I had experienced, but after a solid break from dealing with her in person it’s starting to hit me how abnormal the relationship was. When we first met things moved pretty fast and we official within a month of meeting, I loved her she seemingly loved me, things were intense and she seemed so sweet and innocent at first but the way she idealised me fed my ego, posting instagram stories and tic tics calling me handsome and comparing me to celebrities, and made me almost addicted to her. I did find her highly attractive and things were good in bed too however pretty early on it was clear there were red flags which I should not have ignored.  Within the first couple months I remember one morning she woke up and kicked me out the house because “my presence made it impossible for her to pee” to which I left and forgot about it. She shortly after revealed she had previously been hospitalised for psychosis and never truly recovered. She has been quite dysfunctional since, struggling to hold any job and being unable to do her uni work on her own. After the first 6 months or so her true self begun to slowly reveal itself. There would be occasional explosive outburst of anger for seemingly no reason maybe a sarcastic comment that would be taken way too personally. As time went on this became more frequent. She also had issues making friends she didn’t really seem to have any close friends and was avoiding meeting my own friends and family despite me meeting and getting along well with her family (they were lovely btw, her mum even wanted us to live together full time). I remember the first time I started to question the longevity of the relationship was when I woke up one morning to a really loud bang that caused me to wake up in a state of shock, she had thrown her fan (over a metre tall) across the room at the wall out of nowhere just after waking up, to this day I still don’t know why as I was asleep leading up to this. As time went on the explosive outbursts worsened to the point she would shout at me publicly one that stuck in my memory was her screaming at me in a grocery store near the counter because I waited outside for her (she wanted to get some alcohol, I had forgotten my ID) but after 5 minutes and her not coming out I went in to check everything was ok and that’s when she exploded at me, the way everyone in the store looked at me with concern still sticks in my memory. Another time we had woken up late and I had to leave in a rush to get ready for work, she had been making a coffee I had assumed for herself and as I said goodbye to her she got angry and smacked the glass off the counter, slammed the door on me and screamed “F*** off then”. She became more needy over time, wanting me to stay more and more with her but refusing to ever come round mine, which drove a wedge between my family and friends because I was spending less and less time with them but more time with her, basically sacrificing my own life for her needs. She was deeply insecure would always say she feels like shes not good enough for me, questioning me frequently asking “why do you love me”. Towards the end especially the last month she became more distant, but still said she loved me, 3 weeks before ending things we even booked to go on holiday in the summer with her family and paid for the flights, she was even excited to have “hotel sex” then 2 weeks later she started hiding her phone from me and pulling strange faces (guilty face I suppose), I knew she was hiding something but I just accepted it was going to end soon, that Saturday she dumped me by text saying she no longer feels a connection and that she doesn’t want a relationship anymore, after calling her it was revealed she had been meeting with this over guy and that she had indeed cheated before ending things. It was hard at first, the same day she broke up with me she said she misses me and asked me to come to a restaurant with her and her mum. I declined, she text me to say she’s sorry and she hates herself and that I deserve better, and tried ringing me a few times throughout the week but I didn’t answer as I was done. Decided to establish no contact a week ago and she’s still sending me songs that remind her of me despite her seeing this other dude. At first I was heartbroken and questioning what went wrong or what I should have done better, but after 2 weeks to process things I also feel a sense of relief, knowing I really did the best I could for have for her which is why it probably lasted so long despite her flaws, but also seeing more clearly how little she sacrificed for me. She was just a deeply miserable person who hated herself and will self sabotage anything good for her eventually. Sorry for the long post just needed to vent on the experience that has been the last 1.5 years of my life dating who I believe to be an undiagnosed pwBPD. I’m not the crazy one right?

1jl370e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jl370e/i_feel_so_bad_for_rejecting_him/,I feel so bad for rejecting him,"Hi, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. Chime in to hear about yet another love (?) story involving two young adults in their first year at uni. 

He's one of the topmost students of our class. Excellent CGPA, excellent friend group, all the professors like him (except for the ones that hate everyone and act like they've been forced to work here), probably has a good future lined up for him if he stays on track. Fairly handsome too. 

And then there's me. Has only one friend in class. Not the best CGPA and ofc she's not recognized by profs cause she barely tries to interact with them. Very average looking too. 

Anyway, he told me to meet him at the uni cafeteria to catch-up over a coffee which caught me off-guard cause not like we're close friends so what are we catching up on? Goes on to tell me he's liked me ever since we started uni but was waiting for the right time to say it cause I seemed very closed-off in his eyes. 

I kid you not, this kid has no business liking me. Besides the aforementioned differences, I have an extremely dysfunctional family. I never saw love b/w my parents growing up. Their marriage turned out to be like the ones where they stayed together for the kids even though it was a love marriage. If you don't know what it's like growing up in a house like that, I'm happy for you. 

I currently only dream of graduating with my computer science degree, hopefully get a job where I can get paid enough to live a decent average life. My only little wish is to be able to live a little, be able to not feel like a burden to my parents. 

Not only my parents but there's so many problems going on in my siblings lives too. One is barely passing high school, another has been unemployed for 3 years after graduating from uni, lives as a couch potato with our parents.

I cannot for the life of me stand my family's situation anymore. There are fights going on everyday. We can't even have dinner in peace without my parents breaking into an argument. 

I live on campus and I even dread coming home. I get depressed when home cause unlike at uni where I'm not constantly reminded of how miserable my life is, at home I have to come to terms with the fact that I cannot afford to have fun because I should be busy trying to get away from whatever's going on at home.

Anyway, I told him I'm not good with emotions and that even though he would be considered a great guy by most girls, I cannot get into dating right now or anything like that. I just don't have it in me to even think about my feelings ’cause I was never taught how to love. I don't know what it looks like when two people are in love (keeping fiction aside). I don't think we'd be a good match given our differences too. 

We had like a 30 min talk and I just walked away after saying what I had to say. I obviously didn't go into details about my family but we all agree he deserves someone so much better than this. It's to the point where I just don't even wanna be within his radius ’cause I don't wanna ruin whatever he has going on for himself. I'm sure he'll go on to live a great life and hopefully have a great family. 

A small part of me feels bad for rejecting him because whatever he said to me in the cafeteria that day seemed quite genuine. Although I'm not the best when it comes to judging guys so Idk. 

It was my first time being told by someone they like me and honestly I'm clueless as to why this is. But like I said, I'm not the greatest with feelings so maybe there's something I'm missing here. I still have classes with him and probably will do for the next couple of years and hopefully this doesn't turn into anything bitter. 

Thank you for reading. Thank you for your time. I cannot talk about this with my siblings cause.. Idk they already have shit going on in their lives. 

Peace. Have a good day. 


TL;DR: A really smart, well-liked guy from my class told me he’s liked me since we started uni. I was completely caught off guard and turned him down because I don’t think I’m capable of love, thanks to growing up in a dysfunctional family. Right now, my only focus is graduating and getting away from home. I feel a little bad because he seemed genuine, but I honestly think he deserves someone better.

I've been feeing that way lately, but I recently tried upping the dose again, and I think I might consider periodically decreasing/increasing the dose - less on a weekend or time I don't need to be as ""on it"" and more when I'm really needing it most.

I started taking Atomixetine this oast December (34F). At first, it seemed to be helpful - more alert, energetic, more aware of time, etc. despite all the symptoms being perhaps more noticeable than the subtle benefits, but manageable (dry mouth/feeling the need to drink tons of water to stay hydrated, lack of appetite, sleep issues, some nausea).

After I finished ramping up the dose to 80 mg, I started noticing my ADHD symptoms worsen back to ""normal"" - spacey, slow, timeblind, forgetful, distracted by thoughts and feelings. My doctor upped my prescription to 100 mg, and I don't know that I noticed much difference. 

The past week or two have been stressful work weeks, in additon to some emotional/relational stress. So, the other day I tried taking the 100 mg pill with one of the remaining 25 mg pills I still have.

I felt like I did when the meds were new and ramping up - super energetic, not really needing more than one cup or less of coffee, able to be dilligent at work all day. But it kind of a little too intense? Like feeling like the effects are positive and helpful, but the feeling that you are on drugs, a little too positive in kind of an edgy way.

I did the 125 mg for two days - once with 25 before bed and 100 in the morning (which made wake up at 2/3am), the next day 125 in the morning (slept fine that night). Yesterday, I dropped back down to 100 mg and I still felt an improvement, but more balanced. Though, here I am up way to early again - I wasn't hungry enough to eat a proper dinner, so woke up energetic and hungry.

I think I'll stick with the presribed 100 mg for now, but when I see my doctor for a follow-up next week, I might talk to her about modulating the dose.

I am otherwise a coffee drinker, and I sometimes do this when I notice coffee isn't working - take a day or two with no coffee/decaf or half caf.

The interelation of the atomoxetine, coffee, I also take St. john's wort, exercise, and sleep really all seem to come together to equal how effective I can manage, of course.

Running costs for businesses are too high, so prices go up, but wages and student/maintenance loans have stagnated so the drinks are too expensive. Customers drink the cheap stuff at home before coming out with maybe £20 which doesn't really benefit the economy.

How about off-brand spirits from the budget retailers, cocktails for £5, cheap bottles of beer for £2 and two for one cocktails for far less than a tenner? 

Don't deceive your customers, it is what it is. No Hendricks here, just Greyson's. Margarita for £5? It costs £1.99 in a can from Aldi and it's very good. It's fast and you can get people served in under a minute. Like it should be: a cheap and efficient night out.

Obviously this isn't practical in every sense as you would need to use a wholesaler for the volume, but the intention is there: get people out with the limited money they do have.

Would you be bothered? I believe it's the only way to keep venues open and we shouldn't be too snobby to lower our standards in order achieve the same result.

We're in an era where off-brands are eating into the domestic market share of alcohol, so why not commercialise that? Breweries are suffocating their leaseholders and old free houses are being turned into coffee shops (many of which use awful and/or cheap products anyway).

A lot of cars in my country, especially toyotas: rav4, Hilux, Camry ...etc, started to break down with sever carbon buildup on valves.. A considerable number of car owners had to rebuild their engine heads at a significant cost.

[Here a video illustrating the issue ](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1EVxJ79FcS/)

In the video, a mechanic is explaining that the valves are so gummed up that he has to use a hammer to extract it.

Funnily enough, port injected engines seems to suffer more compared to DI. Most korean GDI engines seems to fair better (for now)!

This issue has been the focus of the public eye, and there is little to no information as to what's going on. Due to many reasons that are too long to explain and not the right place for, a single government company is the sole importer of gazoline, and the general belief is there is corruption.

So, we have to deal this contaminated gasoline for the foreseeable future.

My questions:

1- Would octan booster help?

2- Would Injectors cleaner help?

3- Would adding half a liter of Hydraulic oil to a full tank help? as is widely believed?

4- Would using coffee filter to filter the gazoline help at all?

If you didn’t have a mate out there, somewhere.. I would snap you up in a heartbeat.”
        “I don’t.” I sighed, “He is the Alpha of Tall Pines and he rejected me for being half human. I accepted.. and here we are.”
        He growled “That scum! He better hope I don’t run into him.”
        I laughed and told him, “Odds are you will.. he and his Luna eat at my restaurant once or twice a month. He believes he’s rubbing it in what should have been mine.”
Chapter 1
I yelled “Maddox! Come on, Buddy Roe! I’m going to be late.. I still have to drop you at school.” He hollered down to me he was coming. True to his word, he landed his little ten year old self in front of me from the staircase landing.
He grabbed his backpack and I shoved my phone in my back pocket. I asked “Jeep or bike? It’s still warm enough for the bike.” He grinned and grabbed his helmet. Reckon that’s my answer, then!
I climbed on my Harley Softtail Deluxe and backed it out of the garage. Maddox got on behind me, and we took off for the school. I was hugging the curves and flying low. Maddox loves speed.
Parked out in front of Pine Grove Elementary, I asked “You have everything, right? Homework? Lunch card? Inhaler? Maxi pads?” He grinned and said “You’re such a dork.” Then he walked off, dramatically sighing “Ohhh nooo! I forgot my maxi pads.. AGAIN!”
I started the bike.. laughing at his antics, and made my way to the diner. I walked into a pretty big breakfast crowd, for a Thursday. I smiled and told Ashley good morning.. before checking on my line cook and chef.
She smiled and said “I’m leaving at noon.. but I have Tammy coming in to cover you. The doctor wants to run some labs.. he’s worried about congenital diabetes with this baby. Seems he’s bigger than he should be.”
I asked “Even for a wolf? Does your doctor know you got knocked up by a wolf?” She shushed me and said “No one knows, Delaney! I only told you because you would have smelled it anyway.”
I made a face “Eww. When you say it like that, it sounds creepy.” She giggled “Dude! It IS creepy!” I laughed at her and my wolf, Iris huffed at her.
I set about rolling silverware for lunch and dinner.. and Ashley asks “Hey! Did you hear about the motorcycle club moving to town?” I shook my head and she continued “They bought that five hundred acres with those old campgrounds. Wolf warriors or something.”
I perked up “Wolf warriors? Do you think? Could it be Warrior Wolves? That club that has mostly rejected wolves as their members? If so.. this town just got a whole lot safer. They’re feral rogue hunters.”
She shrugs and tells me “Well. I’m sure I don’t know. There was just a biker in this morning.. at the asscrack of dawn. Before I even got coffee started.. saying his club was moving to town and he was just hanging out.. waiting on Mr. Donaldson over at the bank.”
Again, I nodded. Not that I don’t care.. because I do. A bike club would bring in a lot of business.. and that can only help me out! I smiled at Ashley and said “Hey! Fresh meat! For all you know, your future ex-husband is a member.. a Biker AND a Wolf? Mega jackpot, right there!”
She cracked up and responded “You just can’t help it, can you? Do you make a conscious effort every morning to be a bitch, when you crawl out of bed?” I laughed and said “Hell no! That shit just comes naturally!” Making her laugh, again.
I asked “Did you remind Tammy she’s on her own from three to six? It’s Thursday.. and Maddox has training.” She said “Shit! No! I will text her right now.” She looked around for her phone.. then said “Give me your phone.”
I laughed “Lost it again, did ya?” and handed her my phone. She muttered shut up and texted Tammy. She handed my phone back and said “You have a message from Maddox’s teacher.. something about maxi pads.”
I choked on my own spit. That boy! I texted her back.. explaining it was just a joke between Maddox and myself, and I would take care of it.
I went to the kitchen to see if Chef needed my help prepping for dinner.. but he said no. I have line cooks for the standard daily fare. But Chef works Thursday through Saturday evenings.. for a more substantial, upscale cuisine. It works well for the people in town.
We got through lunch, and Ashley took off for the doctor. Congenital diabetes, my left tit! That baby is half wolf.. he’s going to be bigger! I left at 2:45 to grab Maddox from school.. and hurried home.
We changed into our black combat clothes.. and I threw the duffle bag in the back of the Jeep. I drove out to the old abandoned farm we had found our first weekend here.
I had set up a training ground for Maddox to hone his weapons skills. I don’t know if Marcus is coming for us.. but my little brother will not end up like my mother!
Getting out of the Jeep, I asked “What do you want to work on first?” He shrugged and told me “Archery.. I’m better at that, than knives. And katana is always saved for last! It’s my favorite!” I grinned and said “Mine, too!”
We ran our routines.. and I am so impressed with his accuracy and agility. His speed is increasing, too. His instincts are good and he never freezes. I grinned and said “Next week, we will start on moving targets. You have gotten good enough, we need to step it up!”
He laughed “Yeah. I still don’t want to run the course blindfolded.. like you do. I don’t have that extra boost to my senses, that’s all you!” I told him “You have extra something, Buddy Roe! You’re accurate, as hell.. and fast. Your instincts are on par with a wolf’s.”
I took him home to have dinner and do his homework. Mrs. Sutton from across the street came to babysit, until I closed the diner.
Back at work, I was restocking the cooler and Tammy said “About time you made it back! I had a rush at four. Was in the weeds for an hour!” I straightened up and looked her over “You realize I am the person who signs your paycheck, right?”
She nodded and I snarled “Then what gives you the right to use that tone with me? I won’t tolerate disrespect Tammy! From anyone!”
She sneered “You know what?! I don’t give a fuck! I quit! That new M.C. is taking applications for club girls. Free room and board. A clothing allotment and two hundred cash a week!”
I laughed and asked “You’d rather be a club whore than work in my diner? I wish you luck, young one! I hear initiation is a bitch!”
She scoffed “Not a whore, you idiot. A club girl.” I busted out laughing..” Never been around a bike club, have you? Well! I wish you luck. Now, get your shit and clock out. I will have your final check cut in ten minutes.”
I texted Ashley that we have to run an ad.. I need a new server
Chapter 2
Maddox wanted to spend the day at the diner with me.. so I brought him to work. I had texted his best friends’ mother to see if Hunter could join Maddox for an afternoon matinee.. I know he will get bored.
I had finished clearing breakfast dishes and had set all the tables with placemats and silverware, for the lunch crowd.
We still haven’t put on a new server yet. But the ad has only been out for two days. Saturday mornings are usually Ashley’s shift.. but this pregnancy is hitting her hard.
The curse of being the owner means I turn more key to key shifts than I care to think about. That’s okay, though. I signed up for it. I have to provide for Maddox..
Running away with him before I was even seventeen, was necessary. I wasn’t going to wait around for Marcus to hurt Maddox.. or me! I waited until I heard the sirens and jumped out my bedroom window. With Maddox piggybacking to my mom’s car.
I jumped in and took off. Marcus was arrested and I was three states over, by the time I ditched the car. We rode a train west.. ended up in Pine Grove. Here we are.. five years later.. and thriving.
Marcus was sentenced to ten years.. and that scares me to death. I am technically guilty of kidnapping.. and I really don’t want to have to kill my brother’s father.. but I will. Maddox is my kid! I won’t risk his life!
The door dinged, and I looked at the clock.. realizing the lunch crowd is starting. I yelled at Harry, the line cook.. “Could you fix a grilled cheese and cheesy fries for Maddox? I’ll come grab it in a minute.”
I saw three bikers at the front and walked over. “Follow me, gentlemen.. and I will be right with you.” I seated them and got them some water.
I took an apple juice over to Maddox and he asked if he could play a game on my phone. Handing it to him, I said “Game. No YouTube!” He nodded and I went back to the biker table.
I asked if they’d decided on drinks.. and they all ordered coffee. I brought it back to them.. dropping Maddox’s food.. telling him “At least two thirds.. or no movie matinee.” He grinned and dug in.
I stopped back at the bikers and asked if they knew what they wanted. They ordered burgers and fries. One of them said “Cute kid? Yours?” I grinned and said “Yep! Spit him out just after my eleventh birthday.”
As I walked away, I heard his buddies chuckling at him. I had three more tables seated by the time the bikers food was up. I dropped their order and got water delivered to my other tables.
By the time the other tables were served, the bikers were done. I cleared their table and dropped the check. The largest of the three said “I’m Venom.. President of the Warrior Wolves. We just moved here and I gotta tell ya. You’re the first person to treat us with any normalcy. I mean, we’re used to it.. but sometimes, the stares and the rudeness are a bit much. I just wanted to thank you.”
I grinned “Give it time. It’s a small town. Everyone knows everybody.. they take a while to warm up to new people. I was in your shoes five years ago. I’m Delaney, by the way.”
He nodded and they left.. Just as Hunter and his mother came in. She smiled at me and said she would take the boys to the movies.. and that was one less worry off my afternoon.
I was clearing tables when I realized Venom had left a hundred dollar tip on a forty dollar ticket! Damn! I could get used to that.
The rest of the day was uneventful.. I had enough time to take Maddox home so Mrs. Sutton could get him ready for bed. I rode my bike back for the dinner shift.
I had just gotten the salad bar set when customers started showing up. It was getting hectic and fast paced. Which is exactly how I like it. Doesn’t allow for thinking.. and time flies.
I had cleared my last table when I heard the bell. I looked and saw the same three bikers.. only this time, they had dates.. Tammy was hanging on Venom’s arm. I grinned and told them to sit anywhere and I would be right there.
I brought them water.. and set menus down in front of them. Now.. I am really not sure what Tammy was thinking.. or what crawled up her ass.. but apparently, she thought she could be rude.
As I was placing silverware, Tammy said “I guess me quitting didn’t hurt anything. You’re dead for a Saturday night.” I smiled.. not rising to the bait “Actually, I was slammed earlier.. not that that’s any of your concern.”
She laughed.. a fake assed tittering worthy of mean girl status and I stood waiting. The guys ordered coffee again.. the girls ordered soda.
When I brought the drinks back, Venom said “Delaney, this is my VP Snake and my enforcer Axe.” I smiled and said I was happy to meet them. They ordered their food.. and I went back to stocking for breakfast service.
I brought their food out..and Tammy asked for a side of ranch. I went to the kitchen to get it.. when I returned she asked for extra napkins. I looked her dead in the eye “What are you doing? I won’t be a runner for you. You know me better than that. You trying to impress your pimp?”
Venom said “Hey! I’m not a pimp!” I laughed and said “Ya kinda are, dude. Tammy here is now a sweet butt. You pay her a weekly stipend to entertain the guys.. that includes sex. She can never refuse to have sex with anyone.. and you can make her give head.. to anyone.. anywhere. That, my friend, is the very definition of pimp.” He laughed and agreed.
And I was still not sure what Tammy was thinking.. she jumped up and stomped her ass over to me.. getting right in my face, she screamed “I am no whore! You take it back! I am a club girl.”
I shot an eyebrow into my hairline.. I looked at Venom. Because I know a lot of bikers don’t like their women getting hurt.. even the paid whores. He shrugged and held his hands up in a ‘do what you gotta do’ motion.
I quietly said “Did you borrow someone else’s balls tonight? It is certainly not conducive to your continued good health to get up in my face, Tammy.”
She ground out “I Said… take it back!” I laughed at her and asked “Truth hurts? Let me break it down for you. You signed a contract. To have sex.. with anyone..at any time. You cannot refuse in any fashion.. not the time..not the who.. not the way. Even threesomes will become normal.. all for compensation of some kind. That.. in legal terms.. is prostitution. Not that it is in any way different than what you were doing before.. Maybe you should have thought about it before signing that contract, Sweet Butt.”
She stepped back enough to swing on me. I grabbed her wrist and yanked her to me.. I twisted and slammed her forehead into the table next to me. I growled “You really are too stupid to quit while you’re ahead.” and I knew Iris was shining through my eyes.
I said “And Tammy? Never enter my restaurant, again. Consider yourself banned.” I looked over at Venom and told him “I won’t apologize for marking your whore. She had it coming.. but she’ll probably have a black eye for a week or so.”
He laughed and told me “Oh.. she definitely had it coming. And she will be punished for her actions when we get back to the clubhouse.”
I laughed “Best be prepared to be punishing her, on the regular. She’s hardheaded.. seldom learns.”
Chapter 3
Venom’s POV ~
Another town.. Axe found this one. Which seems alright, as small towns go. We needed to be in this area, anyway.
I founded Warrior Wolves when I was discharged from the army. I had grown up believing I would be Alpha to Golden Lake pack. However, I was deployed when my father was killed, and my younger brother was placed as interim Alpha.
When I was discharged, and went home.. Cabot had decided he liked playing Alpha house.. he also discovered he liked fucking my Goddess given mate. Preferring to challenge me, instead of stepping down.
I laughed at him.. refusing the challenge. I may not like Cabot a lot. He is still my brother, and I would seriously prefer not to kill him. Besides, I wanted my freedom.. being in the military, had me feeling confined. So, I started the club.
We aren’t one percenters.. we, frequently, walk a fine line between legal and felony as fuck..but we only step outside the law when the law can’t get the job done.
I have built our reputation on being there to help. We aid in search and rescue. We hunt down feral rogues.. rapists.. murderers.. Anyone the law can’t find. Or can’t touch. I have been known to do the touching for many police captains.. or district attorneys.
Now, we have moved to Pine Grove permanently. We needed a solid home base.. instead of being a nomad motorcycle club. Somehow, our members have increased to nearly a thousand. My guys need roots. They are all mostly ex-military..and we have all gone through losing our mates. Either rejection or death.. the pain is the same.
The property we purchased butts directly up against the Kootenai Forest. On the other side, is Trenton Falls. Rumor has it, they are dealing with several ferals.. terrorizing the town. I figured two birds.. one stone. We get a permanent home.. and my men can hunt ferals.
After meeting Delaney at the diner, I find myself intrigued. She never blinked twice when three huge tattoed bikers walked into her place. She treated us like we were everyone else. That doesn’t happen often.. So, I have decided to like her.
We are nearly all set up here, at the new compound. The fencing will go in tomorrow.. and should be electrified and ready the day after.
The main lodge needed a new roof, so that was priority. Axe had that arranged before the rest of us arrived. The lodge became our new clubhouse.. complete with a club bar.. and dining room. Forty rooms that became bedrooms.. and the top floor is strictly for the ranks. It worked out well. We turned one of the larger cabins into an infirmary.. and Doc is setting that up, to his liking.
That brings me to the Sweet Butts. We brought four with us.. but had hired twelve more. I don’t mess with the girls much. I might get drunk and demand a blow job, now and then.. But mostly, I steer clear. They get clingy and demanding. Wanting to become somebody’s old lady.. even knowing not one member can take a Sweet Butt to his Valkyrie. That is one of my most sacred rules.
Snake told me he had all sixteen girls in the conference room, waiting on me. I nodded.. pinching the bridge of my nose. I asked “Why must we go through this shit with every new girl we sign?” He laughed “Because we always seem to get the ones who have their heads in the clouds.”
Walking into the conference room, I looked around. They were pretty girls, for the most part. Relatively intelligent. They choose this life for various reasons. Some are running from something or someone bad. Some have nowhere else to go. Some just like to fuck. Those are the ones I prefer to hire. They seldom reach above their station.
I looked at Tammy. She had latched onto my arm in the diner.. glaring at Delaney like she was staking a claim. I am about to nip that in the bud, right now.
She has a huge goose egg above her right eyebrow.. and a lovely shiner. Delaney was right. I smiled at that. I like a woman who doesn’t take any shit!
I spoke quietly, but clearly “All right ladies. We have a few things to discuss before we can call it a night. First rule.. Know your place. You never approach a brother. He will approach you. Never greet one of us when we return from a run. Absolutely, never touch me. I don’t like it.. and I won’t tolerate it.
You are here to service the men.. whether our members.. or a visiting M.C. You do as you’re told. You have the right to refuse service, if you feel your safety is threatened. In that case, you speak directly to Axe.. and he will investigate your reasons.
Never.. and I do mean Never.. stray from your lane. Anyone, member or visitor here is to be treated with respect. Step out of line, you will be punished.
When you are in town, you will behave. You may be sweet butts.. but you still represent my brand. You behave badly, it reflects on the club. Your contract will be terminated for anything that brings embarrassment to our members.
Tammy, you are on your first strike. You deliberately set out to give the diner owner a hard time. It was unprovoked and uncalled for. As punishment you are confined to the compound for two weeks. So, if you have any family you want to notify.. do so now, before your phone is confiscated. Two weeks. No interaction outside the club. Now, I will answer any questions you may have.”
A girl named Bethany asked “What happens if a brother decides he wants one of us, exclusively?” Shaking my head, I replied “Won’t happen.. and can’t happen. It’s against the rules. You are all here to service whomever asks. A brother may choose you as his one exclusive. You girls are still required to service any requests. You don’t have exclusivity. That luxury is not yours, however.”
Another girl, Christie, I think.. asked “What if a brother and one of us fall in love.. can we be together?” I responded “Love has a mind of its own. If such a thing happens, the brother will move into a private residence with the whore. She would never be claimed as a Valkyrie. Not allowed at meetings or parties. And absolutely never permitted to ride behind the brother on runs. He can’t claim her as his old lady.. only as his property. And he has to buy out her contract.”
Someone asked “What happens if we get pregnant?” I grinned “That’s up to you.. your body, your choice. Bear in mind, the only children allowed to be raised in the compound belong to menbers. The brothers will never be forced to pay child support.. unless he chooses. If you decide to carry through with your pregnancy, a DNA test will be done. If the brother who fathered your child decides he wants to raise it.. the pup will be given to him, and you will be paid a severance and made to leave.”
They were all looking at me, wide-eyed.. and I laughed “Go to your rooms. Read over your contracts. All of this is covered.. and you need to memorize the rules. I don’t tolerate the ‘I didn’t know’ defense... I expect each of you to fully comprehend and know these rules, inside out. After today, there will be no exceptions.”
Chapter 4
Delaney ~
Here we sit. Maddox and I. In the principal’s office.. again. Maddox has a bloody nose and the other kid is holding his arm.. giving me the impression he may have a dislocated shoulder.
The principal sighs “Miss Quinn. There seems to be a pattern starting. Your brother can’t go around yanking other students arms out of sockets.”
I nodded.. asking “What preempted this altercation?” The other boy.. larger and more of a bully type.. says “He jerked me out of my chair at lunch. Me and my friends were joking around and apparently Madman didn’t like it. I punched him with my good arm after he hurt me.”
I looked at the principal “I assume you have video surveillance?” He shook his head “The cafeteria cameras aren’t online yet. That’s scheduled to happen today.”
I nodded and said “Convenient. Maddox.. what happened?” The door opened and a woman walked in. Fuck! The mayor’s wife? That means that boy is the mayor’s son? Deep doo-doo, my lad.
Maddox quietly said “He and his friends were talking smack about Valerie. They had hurt her this morning on the way to school and were laughing about it. I don’t know all they did to her, but when she got to class, her arms were all scratched up.. and she had bruises on her face. When I asked her about it, she just told me to leave it alone or it will get worse.”
I asked “Has this happened before, Maddie?” He nodded and said “I thought she was being abused, at home.. but turns out she’s abused on her way to school. And Bert there.. with his three friends, thought it was funny to brag about it, at lunch.”
Valerie is a sweet, quiet girl that hangs out with Maddox and Hunter. I can’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt her. I’m beginning to see why Maddox acted in defense of his friend. I am pissed.
I looked at the principal and said “Perhaps you should be asking why four of your students think it’s okay to bully and physically harm another student.. a little girl, at that.. on her way to school.”
The principal said “If it happens off school property, I can’t do anything about it. I can’t investigate what I don’t know is happening, Miss Quinn. Rest assured I will get to the bottom of it.” I can accept that.
The boy’s mother said “We are here to address the abuse my son has suffered at the hands of this bully.” I snapped “Lady, my brother isn’t the bully in this room. You need to take a long, hard look at your self-entitled, spoiled rotten son. Ask yourself what YOU should have done differently! That boy of yours is headed for a fall.. and it won’t be pretty.”
She snarled “Your brother dislocated my son’s shoulder. I should press charges! Then, let’s see how you act! You expect me to believe what he said my son was joking about? Where’s your proof?”
I demanded the principal bring Hunter and Valerie to the office.. along with the other three friends of Bert. Then I said “If Valerie doesn’t have any marks on her, Maddox will apologize and I will cover Bert’s medical bills. If she does have marks.. your son will apologize to her.. and I want a guarantee it will never happen again.” She agreed.
By the time all the other kids arrived, Bert was squirming in his seat. He was nervous about what might be said.. Interesting..
Valerie’s little face had a scratch above her eyebrow.. and several bruises on her cheeks. Her arms were scratched, all the way up both.. from her forearm to her shoulder. I pulled her to me.. and into my lap. I miss this so much. Maddox only snuggles now if he’s sick.
I asked her to tell me what’s going on.. she quietly starts “I don’t know what I do wrong. They always follow me to the bus stop. When it’s time to get on the bus, they never let me. I usually end up having to walk to school. I’m always late to first period. Today, I really needed to ride the bus to get my science project to school in one piece. They wouldn’t let me. They busted my project.. and shoved me into the thicket. The briars scratched me up and now I am failing science.” She began crying and the whole time she spoke, I watched Bert’s mother.
She asked Valerie what she does to provoke the boys and I lost my shit. I yelled “Are you shitting me right now? You’re THAT guy? You’re the person who accuses an assault victim of asking for it, aren’t you!? I see where your son gets his bullying tendencies. How dare you insinuate this little girl could do or say anything that would warrant being accosted.. molested.. and abused by FOUR boys.. each one much bigger than she is! What the fuck is wrong with you?!”
The principal interjects “Regardless, Miss Quinn. There are repercussions. Restitution must be met. I am suspending Maddox.. pending further investigation since he initiated the contact. Three days.”
I stood and said “I see. So.. punish the hero.. let the bully go free. I am finally aware of what greased wheels mean. I want to be there when you realize riding in the mayor’s pocket is too confining. Mrs. Alden.. feel free and try suing me for your little punk’s medical bills. You will lose! Bert. I haven’t heard any apology! Today was the very last time you ever lay hands on Valerie again. I will be bringing her to and from school from here on out. Maddox. Let’s go.. we have a three day vacation to do whatever we want.. but we will be increasing your training to three days a week. Valerie may need you again.”
I took Valerie’s hand and opened the door.. ushering Hunter and Maddox out.. the principal said “Miss Quinn.. I can’t allow you to leave with these other students.”
I sneered “Call their parents. They already know.” I had texted Hunter and Valerie’s moms when I found out what was going on.
We stopped for ice cream before I took the kids home. We had Valerie laughing and much happier, when I walked her inside her house. Her mom is single.. and works really long hours. I explained to her what had been happening with Bert and his little gang. Then I let her know I would be picking Valerie up from now on. She was relieved and just clung to her little girl, as she cried.
Back at the diner, I got Maddox situated with my laptop so he could complete school assignments. His teachers had agreed to not dock his grades because they felt he was being unjustly punished.
I glanced up, as the bell dinged to see Venom and two others walk in. I brought water to the table and started to place menus down, but I was told they didn’t need them. Simple. Coffee with burgers and fries.
I grinned and said “You’re becoming a regular and this order is becoming your usual.” He shrugged, smiling “I am a creature of habit. And these burgers are pretty damned good.”
I laughed and said “Let’s make it happen, Cap’n!” Not realizing that was his actual rank in the Marine Corps
Chapter 5
Venom ~
This little restaurant is rapidly becoming my favorite hangout. The food is good.. the service better. And Delaney is pleasing on the eyes.. about 5’4.. dark auburn hair.. a body to die for.. or kill for.. depending on the mood.
We ordered burgers and fries.. the damned things are addictive! Chainz asked “The little waitress.. she attached?” I grunted “Beats me. This is only the third time I have seen her. Don’t really know anything about her. I like it here because she doesn’t treat us like second class citizens.”
Chainz grins and says “One way to find out.” When she comes back with our food, he asks if she’s seeing anyone.. She grins and says “I pretty much see everyone.. being the best restaurant in town. If you are asking if I am dating anyone.. the answer is nope. Don’t need to. Don’t want to. I am raising my brother and running my restaurant. I don’t have a lot of free time.”
He shrugs and smirks “Shame. I could show you a real good time.” She laughed at him “I can show myself a good time, without the drama, sweetness!” And it was my turn to laugh. Really starting to like this girl!
She delivered our food.. asked if we were good. Then she excused herself, saying she needed to talk to Maddox and was within earshot if we needed anything.
I tuned my hearing to listen.. just to make sure everything was okay. She said, lowly.. “Okay, Maddie. Out with it.. you’re brooding.” His little boy voice sounded teary.. “Bert’s the mayor’s son, Laney. What if his mother sues me? I didn’t mean to jerk his arm out of its socket.. they just made me so mad.”
She hugged him and told him “My sweet little man. You did exactly what we train to do. You stood up for someone being abused. We don’t stand idly by and allow bullies to go unchecked. I am so very proud of you for protecting Valerie. She’s too small to be accosted by even one boy.. much less four. I meant it when I said you are a hero. I know Valerie thinks you are! As far as being sued.. I pray to the Goddess that woman gets me into court. I will eviscerate that entire family. Remember when I told you some people will always try to throw their weight around and force us into doing something we shouldn’t? And I told you that those same people always have skeletons hanging around they don’t want rattled? I make it my business to locate those skeletons, honey. And I ain’t afraid to rattle the shit out of them.”
He giggled and whispered “I am sorry, though..” Delaney shook her head “Never apologize for being right, Never tell anyone you regret standing up and doing the right thing, baby. There are a million injustices happening around us every day. If we can prevent even one.. then we are doing exactly what we are supposed to do!”
Maddox nearly whined “But, Laney.. what if they rattle our skeletons? What if they make me go back to Marcus when he gets out? What if they put you in jail for kidnapping me? I get so scared, Sissy.”
She pulled him into her lap.. “You listen to me. When I turned 21.. I had old Mr. Masters.. grandma’s attorney.. draft paperwork to adopt you. We can change your last name to Quinn to match mine.. instead of Walters.. Marcus isn’t eligible for parole for another eighteen months. When he was convicted, I was granted guardianship.. we have the adoption hearing in four days. Then… nobody can ever take you away from me, Bubby. No one! I will kill them first!”
As I listened to the love, support and understanding she gave, in listening to her little brother, I realized she is my kind of people.. She believes in much of the same things we stand for. I think I am going to be great friends with her.
That little boy dislocated someone’s shoulder? Damned impressive! She mentioned they train.. I wondered where.. I also wondered why. I found myself really wanting to know this girl’s story.
I mind linked Snake and told him I wanted everything he can find on a Marcus Walters.. on my desk.. within the hour.
We paid the check.. and as I was walking out, I handed her my card, and told her “I overheard what you were saying to your brother. Please. Don’t hesitate to call me.. my numbers are on the card. If you ever need help.. or find yourself in an untenable situation.. call me. It’s what we do.”
Her body language screamed her response. Proud stance.. face set. I grinned and said “You know what they say about pride, don’t you, Delaney?” She shrugged “Yeah.. it goeth before the fall.”
I nodded.. grinning wider “Everyone needs a little help sometimes. It’s okay to ask. Let me be your friend.. we all need to know someone is in our corner.”
She actually smiled.. some of the tension leaving her shoulders.. telling me “I will keep it in mind.”
Shaking my head and chuckling, I walked out.. climbed on my bike and headed to the clubhouse.
Snake met me at the door and said “I ran the info down. You’re gonna be pissed.. this guy is a piece of work!” I nodded my head and went straight to my office.
Opening the file.. I began reading.. Marcus Walters grew up in a group home in Idaho.. problems as a teenager landed him in juvie. Obtained his GED while incarcerated.

I’ve had some days that felt like the end of the world – you know, no cash, no job luck, even my coffee judging me? Yeah, that vibe. Then, flipping through Netflix, I landed on that Naruto vs. Pain episode. Holy crap, what a dumb fight, right? Dude getting smashed left and right, everyone thinking he’s toast, and there he is, yelling he’s gonna save everybody and become Hokage. I laughed out loud, like, ‘Bro, give it up already.’ But then it hit me.

I was like Konoha that day – wrecked, no hope. I’d been hit with ‘no’ after ‘no’: job interview flopped, friend ghosted, plans went poof. Wanted to chuck it all. But seeing Naruto, all beat up, getting back up and shouting ‘I don’t give up’ just slapped me awake. I’m no ninja, but I thought, ‘If this goofy blonde won’t quit, why should I?’

Next day, I got up early – rare for me – and did something small: tidied my space, shot off an email for a new gig. Didn’t fix everything, but it flipped my day. And the wild part? Naruto’s stubborn nonsense stuck with me. Sometimes, keeping going is just that: one step when everything’s screaming stop.

So, tell me: which anime fight pulled you up when you just wanted to stay down? Curious if anyone else got saved by a loudmouth hero’s yelling, lol.",1,1743078670.0,u_Outrageous-Steak5099,0,1.0,False

I’m really having trouble being alone in my house with my baby (5 weeks). I work full time in healthcare, a job I find rewarding and keeps me suitably busy/challenged, but I’m on maternity leave until the beginning of June. I have a history of severe PPD with SI with my first baby. It’s not as bad this time, but I don’t know if this part (the dread and panic when my husband and toddler leave for work/daycare, the intense boredom paired with but simultaneous lack of motivation when I do identify projects around the house I could tackle (plus the difficulty doing them with a newborn)) is even part of it. I don’t want to ask to up my meds or add something new if I’m really just crying and judging myself for feeling this way. What if I eliminate the depressive symptoms and I still can’t just relax. I don’t remember what I used to do with my free time before kids. I used to wonder last time if it wasn’t PPD but just laziness or lack of fortitude. I’m my worst critic, lots of self judgement, which there is more opportunity for now when I’m not working. 

Yesterday I talked to my mom about going over to her house during the day, just to be with people and noise. I even reached out to my boss to do some unpaid tasks for her (she does a lot of presentations and research articles and often asks me to proofread). My first was born in nicer weather and we were better able to get out of the house and walk. Right now we have snow and freezing temps. I don’t have mom friends or friends who aren’t in the workforce that I could meet up with for coffee or lunch  

All of these things don’t feel like solutions, they feel like distractions from dealing with whatever the real problem is. I am going to discuss this more in therapy, it just feels like a heavy lift. Hoping someone can affirm that this was part of their experience, maybe give assurance that this gets better as you got better. If not, just ranting.

The company gives a generous amount of sick time, and I understand that employees should use this when needed.

My problem is more personal and how I can balance empathy for their absences. A couple of my direct reports are always sick, and they often complain about how they don't sleep well, need to nap, etc. Both reports are in their mid-20s. 

It's clear to me that they do not take care of themselves, but that's not really my place to bring it up? If you are not sleeping, showing up to work and you're only just waking up and need an hour to get coffee and settle in, and needing to nap at lunch every day, I feel like there's something going on in your life that you should probably look into.

I look at performance and getting work done vs perfect attendance. I don't want to be ""that"" manager who is so strict, as long as they're getting the work completed, and they are. However, it is my responsibility to cover their work and sometimes they're absent on a deadline day, and I have to complete and submit the work.

I'm just concerned about their personal well being, but annoyed at the same time because there's other employees who are not sick all the time and actually start work around 9am, vs just being there and waking up slowly. 

I find myself struggling with empathy sometimes. I don't know how to always respond positively when someone has constant issues one after another. This one employee is always falling sick (for real, I talk to them on the phone when they call out), but then there's a family emergency another day, and then they need to nap at every lunch break.

Reason for breakup was i had a pretty traumatic childhood that leaked into our relationship. I started going to therapy and working on in before she left me but she said the damage was already done and she cant deal with me anymore. I wasn’t abusive or anything i was just emotionally silent, stone walled after intimacy coz i would get flashbacks and i would ask insecure questions. All things i know i shouldn’t have done i took accountability for it and went to therapy to fix it. She was also not perfect she lied about her ex and forced me to be ok with her still wanting to hang out with her ex friends with benefits. She is emotionally avoidant as hell so never actually opened up to me but forced me to open up to her and she never once came to me with problems we had in the relationship also went to her friends. In the end shes blamed me for everything and said i hurt her very very much. Which i understand to a degree but she also never gave me the chance to fix the things i did wrong coz she would never tell me when i did do something wrong. 

Anyway here comes the asshole part. So today i went and picked up my hoody from her place of work. It was all arranged over the phone she was supposed to leave it at reception and i would just stop get it and leave. I get there and she never left it at reception, i call her and she comes down to give it to me. I was polite said hello, she gave me the hoody then looked at me with big eyes and asked for a hug i said no. Then said goodbye and left. Also keep in mind she asked me to go get a coffee over the phone and i declined coz i dont want to see the women who basically said you are too broken to be loved and took 0 accountability for anything she did wrong.

All my life I’ve struggled with my period. Cramps, Pain, Constipation or Diarrhea, Bladder problems, irregular cycles, PMS… 

I tried a lot of things to better my symptoms like eating less to no sugar/veggie/vegan, no coffee, drinking teas, do sports, sleep, no stress (as far as it was manageable), “listen to my body”, but it never helped. I just felt worse cause I couldn’t eat or drink my comfort food, sports only made me feel sluggish, stress wanted to creep in because I slept and didn’t do much. I went on to unhealthier habits, let’s just say, I didn’t get my period anymore. I was unhealthy but I was happy.

When I recovered and my period came back I was so miserable. I cried for hours and felt so helpless. Las year I decided to switch my gyn. She is the best I have ever had and really takes me seriously. She suspected endometriosis and I felt so heard and understood when reading up on the symptoms. 

Fast forward to getting a laparoscopy last week at a hospital for final diagnosis. After the laparoscopy they told me their suspicions had been confirmed and I should go to my gyn this week for post surgery treatment and to discuss the results. I was fine with that. I didn’t need any more explanations because I thought I finally had an answer to my condition and we could discuss further treatment. 

Well, guess what? It’s not endometriosis. It just looked like it. When they took the biopsies during the laparoscopy the tissue looked like endometriosis, so they told me it was. The pathology report however stated that it is not endo, not inflammatory, not malignant. Just tissue.  

Now don’t get me wrong, I am glad I don’t have cancer or chronic inflammation BUT I am extremely sad and frustrated and lost right now. I am back to my body is just my body hating me without a reason. I feel so helpless and angry at my body that it just can’t function properly. That there is no explanation to why I am experiencing this. 

My gyn tried to reassure me, that she is with me to get to the bottom of my symptoms and to treat them. For now we have to wait for the final report of the hospital (which they told me takes weeks), and we will go from there. 

It’s just so exhausting. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I just want peace. I want the periods to stop. I like being a woman but periods can go fuck themselves. If I could, I would just let them take it all out. ",1,1743077703.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

Where do I go from here?,"I (24M) recently went on a date with a girl (26F) and it was amazing! We clicked really well, we had great fun, it really felt like we had great chemistry and it went on for much longer then we anticipated it. Only catch: she has a boyfriend.

I recently met a girl through work and thought she was cute and interesting. So I texted her asking for a coffee and she said yes. When I get there, I find her waiting all dolled up and ready. She was wearing a skirt, she had done her hair, she was wearing contacts and all around looked great. I mentioned this to say that it wasn't a ""casual"" look but clearly of someone on date trying to look good.

We get coffee and start chatting and 10 minutes into our conversation she casually drops that she has a boyfriend. I was stunned.  At first I thought I misheard her but then she hit me with, ""What about you?"" Unable to process this one-two punch I deflect saying ""No, I don't have a boyfriend"" buying time to think about what's happening. She doubles down and asks me about my dating life and I deflect again saying that I haven't had any luck with long term relationships.

At this point you're thinking, ""Sucks for you dude, but she has a boyfriend. Move on. What's the problem?"" and you my friend are correct except we stayed there for 4 more hours and have been texting since.

As mentioned previously, it was an amazing date. We chatted for 4 hours after that. We laughed and got super comfortable with each other. We went for a walk and when I'd suggest we go back she even made an excuse to elongate the date. After the date/coffee, we have been texting each other nonstop.

She has mentioned this boyfriend twice more over text since, leading me to believe that this is a real person. And even if he doesn't exist her saying it means that she doesn't want a romantic relationship with me, right? 

THEN WHY GO ON A DATE?? I refuse to believe she didn't think of it as a date. She came all dressed up and our level of comfort matched exactly what I would consider a good date to be. Also, no way she didn't get the vibe here. She is super smart and would have realised it right? 

Am I deluding myself just because I like her? Is she gaslighting me to test me (cuz that has happened to me before)? Was she actually just seeing my request for coffee as a casual, friendly and platonic meet up? Idk what to do because I want it to work but not if she actually has a boyfriend.
