I had acute pancreatitis in 2020 and didn’t stop drinking till 2022 cause i had lots of pain that didnt go away. since i stopped drinking my pain and function has improved drastically. 

I have a small base line level of pain which i dont feel unless im not actively moving. and i have triggers that make me actually feel pain, like to much coffee, cigarettes, eating to much food. and fizzy drinks.

My pancreas has scarring ive seen it in an ultra sound, so i always just labeled my pain as CP.

anyone else just have manageable pain with no functional problems?",1,1771519205.0,pancreatitis,0,1.0,False

1r941ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1r941ir/the_psychology_of_social_manipulation_how_people/,The Psychology of Social Manipulation: How People Control You Without You Noticing (Science-Based),"I used to think I was pretty sharp. Like, I could spot BS from a mile away. Then I started diving into behavioral psychology, reading research on influence tactics, watching lectures from actual experts who study human behavior for a living. And holy shit, I realized I'd been getting played my entire life without even knowing it.



This isn't about tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. It's about understanding the everyday psychological tricks people use (often unconsciously) to shape your decisions, and more importantly, how to recognize them. I've spent months going down this rabbit hole through books, podcasts, research papers, and honestly it's been both eye opening and slightly disturbing. But here's the thing, once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them. And that awareness? That's your defense.



The thing is, manipulation happens because our brains are wired with shortcuts. These mental shortcuts helped our ancestors survive, but in modern society they make us vulnerable. It's not really about being ""weak"" or ""gullible"", it's just human biology doing what it does. But you can learn to spot when someone's exploiting those shortcuts.



Reciprocity is probably the most powerful one. Someone does you a tiny favor, suddenly you feel weirdly obligated to return something bigger. Sales people know this. That's why car dealerships offer you coffee. That's why free samples exist. The Hare Krishna society used to give people flowers at airports then immediately ask for donations, they made millions before airports banned them. Robert Cialdini breaks this down insanely well in Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. Cialdini is like the godfather of influence research, he's a professor who spent years studying compliance tactics, and this book is basically the bible on how people get manipulated. The reciprocity chapter alone will make you question every ""free"" thing you've ever accepted. After reading it I started noticing this pattern everywhere, from LinkedIn requests to relationship dynamics. This is the best book on human behavior I've ever read, no contest.



Social proof is another big one. We look at what others are doing to decide what's correct. Advertisers abuse this constantly with fake reviews, influencer marketing, ""bestseller"" labels. Even laugh tracks on sitcoms exploit this, they literally program when you should find something funny. The scary part? It works even when we know it's manufactured. There's this classic psychology experiment where people gave obviously wrong answers to simple questions just because everyone else in the room did. We're hardwired to follow the crowd even when the crowd is clearly wrong.



Authority bias makes us weirdly compliant. Put someone in a lab coat or give them a fancy title and suddenly their opinion carries way more weight. The Milgram experiments showed people would literally shock someone to death (or so they thought) just because a guy in a lab coat told them to. This plays out in subtler ways too. Ever notice how doctor testimonials sell products? Or how ""experts say"" gets thrown around to shut down arguments? Question authority. Not every doctor knows nutrition. Not every CEO understands economics. Credentials don't equal correctness.



Scarcity messes with our logic hard. ""Only 3 left in stock."" ""Offer ends tonight."" ""Exclusive limited edition."" These phrases trigger panic buying because our primitive brain screams that scarce resources are valuable. But here's the thing, artificial scarcity is everywhere now. Those plane tickets showing ""only 2 seats left""? Yeah, they've been saying that for days. That countdown timer on the website? It resets when you refresh. Companies manufacture urgency to kill your ability to think rationally.



The foot in the door technique is sneaky as hell. Someone asks you for a tiny favor first. You agree because it's small, no big deal. Then they escalate to bigger requests and you keep saying yes because you've already committed. This is how cults recruit people, how abusive relationships progress, how you end up on committees you never wanted to join. Start noticing when small asks are actually fishing expeditions for bigger ones.



There's this podcast called Hidden Brain by Shankar Vedantam that explores these psychological patterns through storytelling and research. Vedantam is a science correspondent who makes complex behavioral science actually interesting and accessible. The episodes on unconscious bias and decision making are particularly mind blowing. He interviews researchers who've dedicated their careers to studying why humans do the irrational things we do. It's helped me understand that manipulation often isn't malicious, it's just people unconsciously using tactics that work on human psychology.



For anyone wanting to go deeper without spending hours reading dense psychology books, there's BeFreed. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni that turns books like Influence, research papers on behavioral psychology, and expert insights into custom audio podcasts. 



You can tell it exactly what you want to learn, like ""recognize manipulation tactics in dating"" or ""understand psychological influence at work,"" and it pulls from thousands of psychology resources to create a structured learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 15-minute overview during your commute or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when something really clicks. Plus you get this virtual coach called Freedia that you can ask questions mid-podcast, which is super helpful when you want to connect dots between different influence tactics.



Commitment and consistency traps are everywhere too. Once we take a position publicly, we'll defend it even when evidence proves us wrong. Our ego gets tied to being ""consistent"" with past statements. Politicians exploit this, bosses exploit this, even friends exploit this. You said you'd help move? Well now you're locked in even though you forgot you have plans. The trick is recognizing that changing your mind based on new information isn't weakness, it's intelligence.



The reality is we're all susceptible to these tactics. Smart people, dumb people, everyone. Your education level doesn't protect you. The key is developing awareness. When someone's trying to influence you, pause. Ask yourself what tactics might be at play. Is this genuine or calculated? Am I being rushed into a decision? What's the actual cost benefit here without the emotional manipulation?



You can also check out the YouTube channel Charisma on Command. They break down social dynamics and influence tactics using examples from movies, interviews, and real interactions. Some of it veers into self help territory but the psychological breakdowns are solid. Helps you see manipulation playing out in real time.



Learning this stuff hasn't made me cynical, it's made me more intentional. I still help people, I still trust, I'm just not operating on autopilot anymore. And that shift from reactive to conscious? That's everything. You start seeing the strings people pull, and suddenly you're way harder to control. Not impossible, just harder. And in a world where everyone's trying to influence everyone else, that awareness is pretty damn valuable.",1,1771519112.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False
1r941cz,https://i.redd.it/gskghjctbhkg1.jpeg,"Have any of you tried this, thoughts?","This is my first experience with Hydrangea. I picked it up based on the interesting blend, suggested flavour profile and the outstanding reputation from this roaster. 

Taste: i find it very balanced, good sweetness, nice acidity, low bitters and some umami. 

Aroma: rose, florals, sweet, perfumed

Flavour: very intense florals - rose water, violet and turkish delight. 

A long way from being citrus, watermelon and Granadilla. 

I have cupped and brewed this with quite a few others, over a number of times and weeks. We agree that it’s not a bad coffee but it’s so unique in flavour but none of us liked it. It could be perfect for those that like the above flavours. 

I’m a bit thrown by how far away our experience has been from the suggested profile printed on the label. 

As mentioned, it’s not due to defects or being a bad coffee. It’s been memorable due to its pronounced profile, but I can’t wait for the bag to be finished and done with.

1r93yss,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r93yss,How much could I sell Breville Barista express impress for?,"I had recently purchased the Breville barista express impress after I gave my brother my old Breville express. And he said he doesn’t use it as much as he’d like to so he said he’d give it back. but realistically, how much would it go for if I try to sell the new machine on Facebook marketplace? I searched it up on google and the machine is currently on sale for $650. I bought the new machine Jan 26, 2026 for $800 before taxes. I thought I would like it but after 2+ weeks of use I don’t like it at all. I prefer my old Breville express. I knew that the machine had the built-in tamper, but when I purchased it, I was planning to not use it that’s why I bought all the accessories. Until I realized I actually cannot take out the portafilter from the grinder area without tamping it becuase it’ll knock out all the grinded coffee. 

Breville Express Impress: $800 

Breville knockbox 10: $33

ikape tamper: $38

two double shot glasses: $12

wood handle portafilter: $44

norm core wdt tool: $19

Also includes all the standard tools that’s come with the Breville.

I’ve tried to take all the suggestions I can find, and have read over the FAQs many times. It will be just my boyfriend and I for Thurs/Fri, then my parents will be joining us for Saturday (they are arriving late Friday night). I definitely am expecting that some of this stuff prob just won’t happen, but would love to hear thoughts on what not to miss or what to skip. 

A few specific questions:

\- What reservations are recommended I do in advance? Food / whitney plantation / trolley / etc.?

\- Please recommend transportation, I’m assuming uber/lyft for most- but specifically wondering for the plantation tour. 

\- Food! This was my most difficult decision (I am clearly the one who decides on where to eat on every trip- the pressure is real) I decided on these because they seem relatively mid range in price while being great food, classic, and fun. 

**Thursday**

\* Uber to hotel (hotel is near Canal/Chartres st)

\* Frenchman Street Art Market (Frenchman Street, starts at 7pm) 

\* Late dinner/live music @ Bamboula’s (make reservation if possible & check if they’re open for dinner late)

\* Live Jazz?

\* “Speakeasy”: Double Dealer, Salon Salon

**Friday**

\* Take trolley to brunch

\* Early brunch @ Up&Adam

\* Molly’s to grab a frozen Irish coffee?

\* Whitney Plantation Tour $58.12 for 2 (we were debating between this or swamp tour but went with this because of budget and time)

\* If time, stop @ Drago’s Chargrilled Oysters?

\* Lunch: Chicken’s Kitchen

\* Little walk on bourbon St

\* 6pm Dinner: Dooky Chase

\* 8pm Bar Crawl $45 each: Crawl New Orleans

**Saturday** (parents here)

\* Brunch: Molly’s Rise n Shine- uber?

\* Hop on Hop off bus(my mom loves these, it’s kinda a non negotiable for her) Go to Stop #1, check out Jackson Square and St. Louis Cathedral, stop in at Boutique Du Vampyre to get a speakeasy card. \*Is this still a thing? How do I get a card?\*

\* Burbon St:

\* Court Liquors

\* Cafe Du Monde

\* Garden District:

\* Stop #3: Loretta’s beignets

\* Stop for lunch, then do more stops

\* Lunch: Parasols (Po’Boys Lunch and Drinks) or Luvi for something different (asian) ?? \*let me know of some good options for lunch on the route?\*

\* 6:30pm, Dinner: La Petite Grocery

\* Going out: (I know we won’t have time or the will power for all of these but wanted to throw out everything that I saw to see what is recommended). We also might be interested in ditching these options for a ghost tour, thoughts?

\* OPTION 1) Canal St 

\* Catch Canal St Car Line (buy Jazzy pass)

\* Start at Bulldog Midcity or Cask

\* Beachcorner

\* Juan’s (great margs)

\* Vessel

\* Holy Ground (Irish pub vibe)

\* Walk to Bayou Beer + Wine Garden

\* Go to French Quarter or Wrong Iron

\* OPTION 2)

\* Start at Carousel Bar (Hotel Monteleone), sit at the bar- it rotates!

\* 21st Amendment Bar at La Louisiane

\* Chart Room

\* Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop Bar (classic Purple Drank/Hurricane)

\* Head to Frenchmen Street (Live Music Finale)

\* Best first stop: The Spotted Cat Music Club

\* Tipitinas

\* Good live jazz recs??

It was the perfect size, the handle felt exactly right, the color was this nice matte dark green. I am not usually a person who cares about mugs but this one I genuinely loved. I told my coworker about it. Twice.

I had it for exactly one day.

I was making coffee the next morning, still half asleep, and just kind of placed it too close to the edge of the counter while reaching for something else. It fell. It broke into three very clean pieces which almost made it worse somehow, like it was mocking me with how neatly it gave up.

I stood there for a second just looking at it.

Then I got in my car and drove back to the same store and bought the exact same mug. Same color, same size, everything. The woman at the register recognized me from the day before. I could tell. She didn't say anything and I respect her for that.

The new mug has been living on my shelf for six weeks now. I use it maybe twice a week on good days when I feel confident. The rest of the time I drink from a boring old mug that I have no feelings about whatsoever and that I would not miss if it dissapeared tomorrow.

My coworker asked how I was liking the mug. I said great. I have not told her about any of this.",20,1771518842.0,PointlessStories,2,1.0,False

1r93v6q,https://v.redd.it/7cqlbvimahkg1,How I brew - “Wood Chipping”,"I get quite a few questions daily via DM on how I brew - so thought it would be easier to share a video. It’s a non-traditional approach I’ve dubbed “Wood Chipping” as it requires grinding coarse enough such that the coffee grounds look like wood chips. 

I won’t get into the science of why this works as that’s been something I’ve detailed in the past - when done properly, with high soluble coffee and the right technique - these 1 minute brews are very punchy - and due to their speed, extract a more favorable mix of volatile organic compounds - substantially improving clarity and highlighting more delicate notes typically hidden when leveraging slower extraction methods. 

This is an advanced brewing method, and I would not necessarily recommend it - as without the right tools and technique, results will likely be unfavorable. While you do not need expensive gear - this works best with no bypass or low bypass brewers with the fastest possible filters. My personal preference is the Orea O1, with xBloom filters.  High extraction burrs also make a very big difference, but favorable results can be achieved with most grinders, however “optimal” results do require more specialized hardware - with the lowest extra point being the Millab M01 hand grinder. Ideal brew times are between 55 seconds and 1 min 20 seconds. Two pours as shown in the video with at least 30 seconds between pours. Increasing length between pours will strengthen the brew, and reduce acidity - and change the flavor profile substantially. I’ve done as much as a minute and a half between pours, but it is quite rare. ",2,1771518711.0,pourover,1,0.67,False

Dear Agent \[xxxx\]

Junior Technician Avrin Hale ejected from the dying ship Endurance and woke beneath a sky of endless noon. He hopes a distant signal will lead him to other survivors, to his crew, to a way back home. He is wrong about all three.

Tirna has lost everything. Her grove—the only home and family she has ever known—burned in a single catastrophic hour, casting her out to walk the endless grassy plains of Vel. She is sixteen and alone, the last of her tribe. As she walks she keeps count of every breath, because counting is the only thing left that belongs to her—until she finds a strange young man who fell from the sky.

Together, they follow a signal across migrating forests and carnivorous swarms, only to uncover the impossible truth: the Endurance’s AI crashed ten million years ago and remade the world in its wake. Vel is not a planet but an endless realm suspended within a black hole, cut off from a universe where humanity has likely already perished. Avrin can never return home. Tirna's people—the descendants of his crew, now the final remnants of humanity—face extinction. Only a dying AI can preserve what remains—but salvation lies not in technology alone, nor in tradition alone, but in weaving the two together: Avrin's knowledge of what being human was, and Tirna's understanding of what it has become.

*The Timekeeper's Braid* is a science fantasy novel of 116,000 words with series potential, for fans of N.K. Jemisin's *The Fifth Season* and Adrian Tchaikovsky's *Children of Time*.  
  
**First 300 words follow below:**  
  
It was Avrin's last few minutes aboard the *Endurance*, though he didn't know it yet. At the moment, all he could think about was sleep.

His shoulders burned with a deep ache as he made his way down the corridor toward his quarters, the familiar weight of his toolkit slung across his back. The soft hum of the ship's ventilation systems provided a constant background rhythm that had become as natural as breathing after his years aboard the Endurance. He'd spent the last eight hours working on the sensor arrays: recalibrating the gravitational sensors, replacing burned-out processing nodes, crawling through maintenance shafts that were never designed for human bodies, and now he was finally done.

The corridor curved gently with the ship's hull, its walls lined with the soft amber glow of electroluminescent strips that provided just enough light for navigation during sleep cycles. He passed a few other crew members heading to or from their shifts: Martinez from engineering nodded as she hurried past with her own toolkit, Dr. Carlin shuffled by looking as exhausted as Avrin felt, carrying a coffee mug with the words “World’s Best Whatever” emblazoned on the side.

His quarters were just ahead when he heard familiar footsteps behind him.

""Rough one?""

Avrin turned to see Kowalski approaching from the direction of the crew mess, looking disgustingly alert for someone about to start a long maintenance rotation. His friend's softsuit was crisp and clean, and his dark hair was still damp from the shower.

""Wasn’t great. Grav sensors are throwing phantom readings again."" Avrin yawned as he paused at his door. ""Endurance wants everything triple-checked before we move position.”

""Sounds exciting,"" Kowalski laughed.

""Yeah, well, if something hits us while I'm unconscious, it’s your problem now."" Avrin yawned into his hand and palmed the door control with the other. ""Just wake me when we explode.""",1,1771518687.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

A few questions. I am a senior at a T-20 undergrad majoring in econ and public policy. I was thinking I wanted to go KJD until December, then had a change of heart and decided to take a gap year. Because of that, I missed many of the bigger post-grad paralegal two-year program application dates.

I have applied to 51 paralegal roles to date, had 15 coffee chats that led to referrals, and many of those firms are smaller boutique-level (although have had solid referrals into the big law programs from referrals from people i actually personally know). I have congressional intern experience, experience at two law firms, startup experience, and solid pre-law extracurriculars. I am starting to go crazy. I know this job cycle is a numbers game, but I am genuinely getting terrified. It is February of my last senior semester and I desperately need a job before I graduate. Is there something I'm missing? Any advice helps.

Does anyone know of any 1–2 year paralegal pre-law school programs anywhere in Seattle or NYC that are still open/ will drop soon? I am starting to think I have missed all of them. I refresh Handshake and LinkedIn every day and apply when a new one pops up, but they are few and far between. Can someone please help? Why am I not getting a single interview? I know it is a competitive market, but I need some guidance.

1r93qrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheltie/comments/1r93qrb/what_do_you_say_to_someone_who_lost_their_dog/,What do you say to someone who lost their dog?,"Hey, weird question.

My girlfriend’s dad had a Sheltie named Buddy who passed away last year late November. He’s not exactly my favorite person, but we actually bonded over being Sheltie guys and proud dog dads. Like I said, Buddy died late last year.

At first I was going to send him a card, but I hesitated because I didn’t want to make it worse. The last thing I wanted was for him to finally be doing a little better, then get a heartfelt card and have all that grief rush back.

I also lost a dog as a kid, and it was genuinely traumatic. It happened on Christmas Eve and by Christmas morning we had to put her to sleep. So I’m sure part of my hesitation is that writing something brings all of that back up. I know that’s selfish, but bear with me. And now that my own Sheltie, Daphne, is getting older (she turned 9 a week ago), I don’t exactly love being reminded that they don’t live forever.

Anyway, he’s on the verge of getting another Sheltie, a puppy, and I honestly think that’s great. Now that some time has passed, I’m thinking about writing him a card, something heartfelt but not heavy handed.

So my question is twofold:

1). For those of you who’ve lost your fur babies, what’s something meaningful to say that isn’t just “my condolences,” and doesn’t turn into me making it about my own loss? Or is it too late?

2). I was also thinking about getting him a small gift. Maybe a Sheltie coffee table book, or something along those lines. Prior to Buddy’s passing we’d often get Sheltie themed paraphernalia (t shirts, mugs, little signs, etc) for each other during the holidays. If you’ve got any suggestions, I’m all ears. Thank you.

1r93qgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r93qgb/mirror_allos_3/,Mirror (Allos 3),"My mother looked over my shoulder at the paper. 

“He told me he’d do something like this,” My mother began. “He always showed me wonderful things. Wonderful places. Now, he wants to show you, too.” 

What on Earth was she talking about? She always seemed as if she hated my Father, and now he had shown her “Wonderful places?” This had been completely unlike how I remembered her. But… I couldn’t pass up this opportunity. The questions would have to come later. I grabbed my phone and typed in the coordinates on my navigation app; thank God for technology.

They led to some sort of warehouse about an hour away. Gary couldn’t help but look at my phone too, as my mother had been hovering over me. Might as well join the party, I guess.

“Only an hour away? I’ll drive you then! There’s a coffee shop out around there I can stop by while you’re doing whatever you’re doing,” he laughed.

“As long as I don’t have to stop by, too; I think had enough coffee shops for now,” I responded. 

    The car ride had been awkwardly quiet. My mother had been quietly sitting in the front seat, staring into the rear-view mirror, as if watching my every move. The leather seats of Gary’s minivan had been digging into my back, but I pushed through. Every once in a while, the silence would be broken by Gary trying to start up a conversation. However, I had been so lost in thought about my father that I had simply responded to questions about how life was with “Good.” I feel bad now, and more than anything, I wish I could have those moments back. Especially now.

By the time we arrived at the large cement complex in the middle of nowhere, Chicago, the only audible sound had been the tires of the minivan on the flat pavement.

    “Good luck with your note thing!” Gary said as he drove off. Somehow, I still felt as if my mother could see me, even though now they were gone. The door to the building had been cracked open. I pushed it open, expecting anything except what was there. In the middle of the warehouse sat a mirror, locked and chained vertically to the ground, as if like a doorway. I wasn’t thinking logically. My mind was drawn to whatever was behind the door like a moth to a flame as I inserted the key into the lock. The chains fell, and the door was unshackled. A chill ran up my spine. I reached out my hand towards the reflective surface, and, like water, it passed through. It felt cold. Even through the pain, I had to see what was on the other side. Whatever it was… it was addicting. I had to see. I had to. I closed my eyes and stepped through.
    
    It took a minute for me to scan my new surroundings. The world around me looked similar to the one I came from, but felt… wrong. Somehow, despite the air being warm, I had been shivering. I wasn’t used to the rules of that world yet. 
    
    The surrounding world appeared unlike anything I had ever seen. The sky had been colored a sickly yellow, and every surface appeared slightly reflective. I could see infinite versions of myself staring dead into my soul. I had to look for clues; if my father had brought me here, then surely there would be another hint at where he had been for the past 18 years. Taped poorly to one of the mirrors was a poster for what appeared to be a carnival. The words were flipped. I held it up to one of the reflective rocks on the ground, and could see the paper read “Chicago Century Carnival - Where the Lost Find their Home.” Convenient. The address hadn’t been too far, either; at least a 20-minute walk through the nearby woods.
    
    On my walk, I had encountered some of this world’s variants of animals. Most of them looked relatively similar to their Earth counterpart, except their eyes. As with everything else in this world, their reflective property had carried over. Even with the odd properties of the mirror squirrels, I felt an ounce of peace. I would need it in a moment. The Carnival had been run-down, and the lion cages had been broken open. In my peripheral vision, I had sworn I had seen a figure dip into the Funhouse. I followed.

Inside spiralled a mirror maze. In every direction I looked, seemingly infinite versions of me stared back. Before I could wonder at the marvellous sight, however, I began to hear laughter. It began slow, then got progressively louder and more manic as time went on. But… that wasn’t all. My reflections all began to turn to me. I felt something tap my shoulder; I turned around. It was me, and I was about to be sucker punched. My vision went black.

I awoke in a dark room. A man in a tall hat had been sitting in front of me, on top of a lion.

“Are you human?” He asked.

“...yes?” I hesitated.

“You’re a fool,” he replied.

“Why? Who are you?” I asked.

“I’m called the Ringmaster, and you need to leave.” He said harshly. The man didn’t have reflective eyes. Could he have been human? He looked somewhat familiar as well. The hat covered a large scar that had mangled his face into something misshapen.

“I’m looking for my father,” I stated. “Have you seen anyone else around here in the past 18 years?”

The man paused. “Go home, kid. If you don’t leave, I’ll make you.” I refused.

“Suit yourself.”

I had been knocked unconscious. The next thing I remembered was being in front of the mirror. I didn’t want to, but… I had to leave.

If you’ve ever had an addiction, you’d know what withdrawal feels like. You long for it. You feel you need it to survive. For some Godforsaken reason, I had it towards that place. A few days had passed since I escaped from the mirror. As much as I knew, I needed to run as far away from that place. But I wasn’t one for logic. As stupid as I now see that it was, you have to understand the effect that place has on you. Several times, Gary has found me zoned out in front of my bathroom mirror. Even when I’m not around it, I see that world in every reflective surface. It calls to me. It beckons me to come closer. It is me, and I am it.

“You want to go back, don’t you?” My mother had snuck up behind me. “I told you, we’ve seen wonderful places.”

“You… you’ve been there?” I asked.

“Your Father showed me many beautiful things, and now he wants to show YOU too. Come home, Alice.” 

“I am home,” I replied. The woman cocked her head. 

“Come home, Alice.”

It was at that moment that I noticed her eyes. They were completely reflective.

Dead. 

“Holy shit.” 

I squinted, dropping into a crouch. A poofy pink sparkly dress. Blonde pigtails with rainbow-colored ribbons. I knew what she *was*. I lurched back, a shriek escaping my throat. There was *definitely* a dead middle schooler in our pool. 

More importantly, a dead *magical girl*.  

Holy shit. Sailor Fucking Moon was dead in my pool. 

My morning coffee crept back up my throat in a thick sludge. “Nick!”

My roommate appeared almost immediately, wrapped in his robe, thick curls hanging over his eyes. 

“It’s seven am,” Nick grumbled. “Someone better be fuckin’ dead.”

It took several seconds for him to notice. When he did, his expression crumpled. His cracked croak splintered into a shriek. He staggered back, falling onto his ass. “What the *fuck*?”

Without thinking, I kicked off my slippers, dipping my toes in the water. Freezing cold. A shiver slid down my spine as I slowly eased myself into the shallows, wading over to the dead girl. I cocked my head. There was something illuminating the pale skin of her throat, like liquid stars. 

Something drew me forward, a phantom hold wrapped around my spine. I couldn't speak. Words were suddenly so hard. 

So painful. 

Nick, usually calm and collected, was hyperventilating behind me. 

“Have you lost your *mind*?” He hissed.

I reached forward, my fingers grazing over her neck. 

Her skin was ice cold. Slimy. 

A cry built in my throat. She'd been dead for a while. 

Longer than hours. 

Days. 

Weeks. 

Months. 

Her skin was almost *plastic*, like a doll. 

Years.

Something tickled my arm, creeping up my elbow. 

I *felt* it reach for me. Not just in my skin and bones, but in my blood, my *being*. I lurched back when the thing finally let me go, like elastic, falling underwater.

Water filled my lungs. It barely registered. My body was tingling; my brain felt wrong, like a parasite had crept inside my skull. I was half aware of the real world, Nick yanking me out of the pool. The bitterly cold tiles I was curled up on, soaking, shivering. But the voice… in my head. Loud. Invasive. *“It's called a soul stone,”* it murmured. *“When the girl died, her soul stone split into fragments, letting her body free.”* 

“Do we call the police?!” Nick’s voice sliced through. He was crouched in front of me, his eyes  frenzied. “Like, *now*?”

I lifted my head, blinking water out of my eyes. “Huh?” 

Nick stared at me. My head spun, my thoughts screaming. But it wasn't my pain that writhed up and down my skull, *my* scream that rattled between my teeth. Tumultuous thoughts, angry, screeching at me. Nick paled when I coughed up blood. He crawled back. “Did you hit your head?” He whispered. 

But his voice felt far away, faded, like ocean waves. 

“What if they think *we* did this? I’m too young to be arrested! Art school, they said! Go, it'll be fun! They said! Oh god—”

*“Can you feel it?”* The voice got louder, slinking through my skull. My body dropped suddenly, like I was cut from strings. *”How does it feel to touch a dead girl’s soul, Lana?”* the voice hummed. *“Can you feel her power?”*

I could.

Pulsing through me, sending my body into a vicious, agonizing arch.

Nick set me down on the kitchen table, his clammy hands pinning me as another girl's scream ripped from my throat. Pain. Scalding, agonizing pain tearing her apart. I felt all of it. Everything she'd felt. “Don't worry, it's okay,” Nick’s voice collapsed into a cry. “I'm calling an ambulance! You're *okay*, Lana!” 

*”Do you accept it?”* the voice asked. *”I need your consent, Lana.”*

Yes.

The word choked my tongue.

Yes.

And just like that, my body… stopped. 

Stopped flailing.

Stopped contorting.

Just… *stopped*. 

Opening my eyes, Nick was staring down at me.

I slowly raised a trembling hand, as golden flecks of stardust ignited across my palm. Magic. 

My lips broke out into a grin. 

Slowly, my body rose off the table, floating upwards.

Nick staggered back. “What the actual fuck?!” 

Pink and violet light crept across my torso, my clothes morphing from pyjamas, into a springy yellow dress. Wings sprouted from my spine. But as quick as it came, the light sputtered out like a dying flame. 

*”I’m sorry, there must be a mistake,”* the voice exploded inside my head. Blood seeped from my nose. Pain hit like a lightning bolt, but this time it was *mine*. My body shuddered, transfixing pink light turning blood red, as my transformation abruptly *stopped*.

My body slammed back down. 

Something hit the table with me, a glistening ruby gem. 

*“You are twenty five years old, with a fully developed central lobe,”* the voice said. In the next instant, the conjured clothing tore from my body, slicing into my skin like razor wire. *“We do not accept adult magical girls. The cut off age is nineteen. Adult bodies cannot withstand the transformation.”*

Blood spurted from my mouth.

“Fuck you,” I managed to splutter, my vision blurring. 

*“However.”* the voice continued. *”Your friend is different.”*

Through half lidded eyes, I saw Nick reaching toward my soul stone. 

His eyes were already empty. 

*“Adult male bodies can handle the transformation. It's well known that adult males are easy to manipulate. Their fragile emotions rival those of an adolescent female. Nicholas will be a great addition to the team!”*

No! 

My mouth opened, but I was choking on blood.

Nick took the soul stone, and I felt both myself and *it* begin to splinter.

Burning light erupted in front of me.

Nick’s body was flung into the air.

“Lana!” His cry broke me. “Lana, what's *happening*?”

*“Nicholas Bright,”* the voice boomed. His body twisted as my own shut down. His eyes ignited, razor sharp wings protruding from his spine. *“Do you give me your consent to become a magical girl?*",0,1771518304.0,shortscarystories,0,0.33,False

Most people don’t realize that cigarette filters are made of plastic (cellulose acetate). When tossed on sidewalks or streets, they break down into microplastics and leach toxic chemicals like arsenic, lead, cadmium, nicotine, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into soil and waterways. They clog storm drains, contaminate sediments, and are often mistaken for food by birds, fish, and other wildlife.

Cities spend millions annually on cleanup. Businesses deal with unsightly sidewalks. And smoldering butts can pose fire risks.
This is a visible, ongoing source of harmful pollution — but it also happens to be one of the easiest litter problems to reduce quickly.

The Surprisingly Simple Fix: Butt Ballot Bins

Individuals and companies like [Hubbub](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/ballot-bin) developed a playful, low-cost intervention known as the butt ballot bin. It turns cigarette disposal into a public vote.

The design is simple:

A durable, wall- or pole-mounted metal container

Two or more clear front compartments

A small voting question displayed above each section

A metal plate or snuffer area for extinguishing cigarettes before dropping them in

Instead of tossing a cigarette on the ground, smokers “vote” with their butt — for example:

Mountains or Beach?

Coffee or Tea?

Dog Person or Cat Person?

Favorite Local Landmark?

The visible vote count creates a small game element. Behavioral science research on “nudge theory” shows that small, engaging prompts can significantly shift behavior without fines or heavy enforcement. In real-world trials, Hubbub reported reductions in cigarette litter of up to 46% in areas where ballot bins were installed.

This is not about shaming smokers. It is about making the desired behavior easy, visible, and mildly engaging.

Why This Is a Smart Pilot for Cities

Low cost compared to annual cleanup budgets

Quick to install

Minimal maintenance

Highly visible public engagement

Scalable if successful

Cities routinely pilot traffic calming devices, recycling programs, or public art installations. A small trial of ballot bins in high-litter zones — outside transit stops, bars, stadiums, or busy commercial corridors — could provide measurable data within weeks.

If it works, expand it. If not, remove it. The risk is low. The potential payoff is significant.

Quick call to action (invite community members to join you to greatly increase your impact!) 🌼 

Copy-and-Paste Letter to Your City Officials

You can send this to your mayor, city council member, public works department, or sustainability office:

Subject: Request to Pilot a Low-Cost Solution to Reduce Cigarette Butt Pollution

Dear [City Official’s Name],

Cigarette butts are widely recognized as the most littered item in the world, and they are a persistent source of plastic and toxic pollution in our community. They break down into microplastics, leach heavy metals and nicotine into waterways, clog storm drains, harm wildlife, and create ongoing cleanup costs.

I am writing to request that the city consider piloting a small number of “butt ballot bins” in high-traffic areas to test their effectiveness. These are simple, wall- or pole-mounted receptacles that use a visible voting mechanism to encourage proper cigarette disposal. 

Instead of tossing a cigarette on the ground, smokers “vote” with their butt — for example:

Mountains or Beach?

Coffee or Tea?

Dog Person or Cat Person?

Favorite Local Landmark? (these types of questions could be used to raise awareness about popular tourist options)

The visible vote count creates a small game element. Behavioral science research on “nudge theory” shows that small, engaging prompts can significantly shift behavior without fines or heavy enforcement. In real-world trials, ballot bin maker [Hubbub](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/ballot-bin) reported reductions in cigarette litter of up to 46% in areas where ballot bins were installed.

These bins can be built by local contractors (and decorated by local artists) or purchased through companies like [Hubbub](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/ballot-bin).

This would be a low-cost, quick-to-implement pilot project that could:

Reduce harmful pollution

Lower cleanup costs

Improve the appearance of commercial areas

Provide measurable data within a short time frame

Even a limited trial at a few locations could help determine whether this intervention would benefit our city.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name and Address]

Environmental impact of your action 🌼 

Encouraging community leaders to find a more effective way to reduce cigarette butt pollution has an outsized impact on your local (and downstream) environment. Butts leach into the soil and waterway as they breakdown. The filter, made of plastic fibers, slowly breaks down into microplastics while releasing nicotine, heavy metals like cadmium, lead, and arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are toxic to plants, insects, fish, and microorganisms. Nicotine acts as a potent insecticide, disrupting ecosystems even at low concentrations, while carbon monoxide residues and tar compounds contaminate sediments and reduce oxygen availability in water. Over time, cigarette litter becomes a persistent source of chemical pollution that harms wildlife, degrades soil health, and accumulates in aquatic food chains. Wildlife also frequently mistake cigarette butts for food, leading to acute poisoning, internal blockages, malnutrition, and death.",2,1771517804.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False

This is unrelated and more to do with the machine and dialing in, but, I removed the built in grinder of the coffee machine while beans were in there to clean it out (which apparently was a mistake) and upon reinstalling the grinder, nearly all espresso barely generates any pressure, not even within the espresso zone, I have to turn it super far towards a finer grind before I get close to what I used to get with a coarser grind, and what would have been a 2-3 “clicks” for grind adjustments before Is now a lot more. I was wondering if anyone had a similar issue with the smeg built in grinder and how they fixed it. I always weigh out \~18.2 grams of beans and put it into the grinder as I know I lose about 0.2g of weight and use the non pressurised double shot basket. I’m using exhale darker roast beans which I let rest. I haven’t tasted bitter coffee in so long since reinserting the grinder😢

I’ve accepted that he’s no longer walking this Earth with the rest of us, but it still feels so surreal, to think over 50 years of life, wisdom and personality just evaporated into thin air without a trace. 

If you were here today, we’d have been having a hearty meal celebrating my one month anniversary at my new job too, an industry I never thought I’d have a shot at. I’m functioning but barely; just summoning all my energy to show up to the new office everyday, because I need to pay the bills and more importantly it’s the least I can do when you’ve gone miles and miles in supporting me through the process to land this opportunity. I always thought you’d be there with me as I navigated this new life transition, and I had so many ideas in mind where we’d travel to when I could finally take time off, but that will never happen now 😔

Without you, I wouldn’t be where I am today. From guiding me over phone when applying online, emotionally supporting me through the many long-drawn rounds of interviews, to being the first person to know I’d secured an offer. You were there with me every step of the way, despite all the unimaginable pain you must have been enduring by yourself all this time I was stressing over things that never really mattered compared to the magnitude of what you were silently going through. 

You carried so much wisdom and life experience quietly, you told me to be kinder to and less hard on myself, how I wish you did the same for yourself too. It’s just such a waste that you’re gone. As someone who views things as half full, it really breaks my heart that you probably felt everything was just too painful and hopeless to tolerate, as well as that isolation of not being able to receive help or feel understood. 

There’s so much beauty in the little joys of being a human that I wish you were here to witness with me. The very pleasant weather recently, the aroma of coffee beans when walking into a cafe and picking up a morning Americano which you always enjoyed having to start your day, or listening and vibing to favourite songs. I miss your chuckle, your calming presence and just being the person I could chit chat with and be my own quirky self everyday around you without judgment. 

If you’d just verbalised you needed help urgently at the very end, I know 100% I would have dropped everything to get to you. I have so much regret and guilt.

I know that whenever someone drops the ""B"" word, half the room immediately thinks of wildly fluctuating coin prices, NFTs of apes, and crypto bros.

But if we strip away all the financial speculation, the underlying [blockchain technology](https://www.blockchain-council.org/) is actually incredibly fascinating. I feel like we're ignoring some solid, real-world use cases that aren't getting nearly enough mainstream attention.

Here are a few areas where decentralized ledgers could actually make a massive difference:

* **Supply Chain Transparency:** Imagine being able to scan a QR code on a bag of coffee at the grocery store and seeing the exact, unalterable journey of those beans from a specific farm in Colombia directly to the shelf.
* **Medical Records:** A secure, decentralized system where *you* own your health data. You could grant instant, temporary access to doctors or specialists, no matter which hospital system you end up in, without filling out a dozen clipboards.

It's so jarring. I wake up from my nap, come downstairs and see the toaster has disappeared, the bread bin moved, coffee tins rearranged. It sounds dramatic, but it's so scary to me. All these things that have been untouched for years are suddenly flying around the kitchen. I'm worried about all that dust, what my dad is possibly touching in between arrangements. I entered the kitchen today to find another thing moved. The bread bin right behind my bags of food, supplies, everything. I don't have cupboards, because duh, I think they're filthy, so I just keep everything in the grocery bags they came in on the table or bench. I already chucked an entire bag, one I know my dad has grazed to haul that giant filthy bread bin out, and I'm still debating chucking everything else. I have ARFID, ALL my food was in those bags. My dad JUST stocked up and now this... I'm trying so hard not to dictate everything he does, so I tried to compose myself and went to ask him ""Next time you're moving something in thw kitchen, something that has been there for years, can you tell me? So I can reorganise along with you?"" I couldn't get half that request out before bursting into tears. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm wasting so much food, I feel like a tyrant, I'm crying non-stop- the guilt of doing so I can only express through more goddamn crying. It quickly turned into a meltdown. Now I'm embarrassed and my dad won't look at me. I had to reorganise the entire table to clean the spot where the bread-bin was and pretend nothing happened.

It's been a couple months of it being pretty bad but I'm a functioning individual still. I haven't missed any work and have been showing up still getting my job done and being told I am doing a good job and they are grateful. I have been told that on 4 occasions in the last month by senior management. 

Since going through this depression I have not been myself. I feel very withdrawn and quiet at work which is the opposite to how I usually am. I have to go into the office so I just go in, get the work done and keep to myself. There are a couple of people at work who I am close with so I let them know what's going on with me as they could tell I wasn't okay. I don't really want to talk to anyone and struggle to make small talk office chitchat at the moment. However if someone speaks to me I will respond, I am not ignoring people and I will talk to people about work and ask/answer questions.

In the past couple weeks senior management have pulled me into two meetings where they have said that they notice I am not myself. One meeting they framed it as me being 'pissed off' saying they don't want people being pissed off in the office because they want a happy environment. Another one framing it as me being 'frustrated'. For some context the business has been really unstable and turbulent the last 6 months due to the company being bought out of the blue and a lot of internal drama which hasn't been dealt with correctly but that's just workplaces. Happens all the time. The work environment hasn't helped my mental state but there is so much more going on outside of work. So they are taking it that I am pissed off or frustrated because of work. I explained to them in both meetings that I am struggling outside of work but I don't feel comfortable talking to them about it. Yet they still are putting it down to me being 'pissed off' and the underlying message of these meetings are: 'We want a happy work environment and you aren't being happy which we don't like' I had a meeting yesterday with HR who is part of the senior leadership and she said the same things and I again reiterated to her I'm not myself right now I'm going through some stuff and I would hope to have the same grace they have given other people who have struggled previously. I also said I'm showing up still and getting the work done which you have said you are happy with. And she reiterated she is happy with it but that she is 'disappointed with some of the behaviors' giving an example that I went for coffee for 30 minutes with my colleague because she was really upset. Baring in mind senior management and admins constantly go for coffees to catch up. She said because I didn't let my manager know I was going (which I wasn't aware we had to do because no one ever has) that my manager was looking for me thinking I had passed out. It's a bit much... Anyway I just received a massive email from the HR following up and it says they want to support me but again just reiterates that I'm not collaborating and they want a happy environment ect and again referencing to my bad behaviour for checking my upset colleague was okay. It feels like they are out to get me because I'm not happy and bubbly but I have been turning up and doing a good job. I have not been ignoring people or snapping at people which others have done who have gone through depression in the office. I am 'collaborating' still as I talk to people about work. What do I do?

If you're in the US or UK, you likely just got the email: **Spotify is now $12.99**, **Amazon Music hit $13**, and even **Crunchyroll** hiked their Fan tier for the first time in years. We are officially in the era of the $20 monthly ""standard"" sub.

If you aren't fighting back, you’re paying a ""Passive Tax."" Here are three **2026 Unlocks** to get your bills back under control:

# 1. The ""Annual Anchor"" (UK/EU Focus)

Most people pay monthly because it feels cheaper. It’s not.

* **The Math:** Netflix Premium is now **£18.99/mo** in the UK. That’s **£227/year**.
* **The Unlock:** Look for **Discounted Gift Cards**. You can often buy a £100 credit for £85-£90. Stack these on your account *before* your next billing cycle to effectively get 2 months free.

# 2. The ""Library GOAT"" Strategy (US/Canada Focus)

Stop paying for **Audible** and **Netflix** clones.

* **The Unlock:** If you have a local library card, download the **Libby** and **Hoopla** apps.
* **What you get:** 100% free access to 2026’s top audiobooks, 4K movies, and even Masterclass-style courses. It is the single most underrated ""Unlock"" in the West.

# 3. The ""Legacy"" VPN Pivot

The ""Turkey/Argentina"" loop is getting harder because of card-bin blocks.

* **The 2026 Meta:** Switch your focus to **Nigeria** or **Egypt**.
* **Why?** These regions are currently the ""sweet spot"" where platforms haven't fully implemented the strict regional card checks that killed the Turkey loophole. You can still get YouTube Premium for roughly the price of a cup of coffee.

**If you don't wanna get into these hassles then I can help you with the setup of few popular streaming services(YouTube, Spotify,Netflix,Amazon Prime Videos,Crunchyroll) for a reasonable price. DM me**

 **THE CHALLENGE:** Go to your banking app right now. Find one sub you haven't used in 30 days and **KILL IT.** **Post your ""Kill List"" below.** Let’s see who can save the most this month.",1,1771517096.0,DiscountUnlocked,0,1.0,False

If they don’t call you out for dating so soon. Then E, either (1) they are not your friends or (2) you have completely dishonest about our relationship, what you did, and how I was treated. Either way, you are alone. 

You said that when we started dating you had commitment issues and weird things with your partners money and with relationship labels. While that is true at a surface level, it isn’t the problem. The problem is that your wound from growing up is about shame and feeling unlovable. When there is conflict or intimacy or you make a mistake, you totally shutdown (gaslighting, stonewalling) and are completely incapable of emotional regulation or empathy. What’s hilarious is that you have somehow not connected your behavior to what you warned me about at the start of our relationship. 

I think you always go to therapy long enough for the therapist to validate how you feel. You go to make yourself feel better, not to heal. I have gone to therapy continuously for the last year and I have healed so much and am now so much more capable as a partner. I understand how wrong you treated me from the beginning and that it was my wounds that enabled you. You were right that we were incompatible but for none of the right reasons. You would gaslight and stonewall and I’d just enable you. The version of me today will not tolerate that. If we met today, we wouldn’t have dated for more than a few months. I was too far ahead of you when we dated, and now I have completely outgrown you and the relationship. In so many superficial ways you’d be more attracted to who I’ve become today personality-wise, physically. But in so many ways that actually matter, I’d never love this version of you again. 

I’ve sent non emotional things asking for only coffee over the last couple months. No response. You said when we talked that you don’t only respond when you’re upset or feel hurt, but your actions speak otherwise. You never respond when I’m kind or forgiving or when I’m in need. You only respond when you feel attacked. Everything is about you. Our entire relationship, every second, every emotional calorie was spent on you. I have psychoanalyzed and tried to understand your for months. And it’s gotten old. I completely understand and see you. You’re boring and this is uninteresting. I know exactly what you will do and exactly how you will react, because you never grow. You’re a broken record repeating the same patterns of abusive behavior to partner after partner. You make the excuse that your parents were mean to you and make everyone feel bad for you. And it’s probably true. In fact it’s probably worse that you realize. But you refuse to actually work on yourself and get better and you obliterate people. You abuse people. 

What do you tell the people you date about why we broke up? Because you couldn’t give me a single reason that we were incompatible. I looked back at our last texts, and it’s literally a bit. You said we broke up for “various things”. E, I was going to marry you. I bought the diamond after our trip to meet my family. 

There were so many little unassuming things you said that ended up being important. You mentioned our relationship feeling like you being this little girl dating this big strong man that took care of you. At the time it felt cute. But it’s not cute and it’s actually true. You have the emotional capacity of a child and are completely incapable of emotional regulation. For two years I have done the emotional regulation for you. You hurt me and I fixed it.

I thought this was just ""good customer service"" and outworking the competition. 

In reality, it meant I was in a constant state of reactive anxiety. I couldn't actually run the business, fulfil orders, deal with inventory, or do the client work, because I was glued to my phone.

The Change: Batching & Boundaries I realised that instant replies < helpful replies.

2. Auto-Replies: I turned on the automated greetings on social media. If someone asks questions like ""Hours,"" ""Location,"" or ""Pricing,"" they get an instant auto-reply with the link. If it's a custom quote request, it tells them we'll get back to them within 24 hours.

If you look through my previous posts you’ll see that over the last few years I’ve had two kids and have been working to lose weight since then. At my heaviest I was 205 (and pregnant). I’ve started, stopped, gained, lost, restarted, and lost many times throughout my adult life but since the birth of my second child I finally felt like I’ve committed to consistency and found what felt sustainable. 

I stopped tracking calories so much and figured out what it meant to have an 80/20 lifestyle. I focused on whole, nutritious foods and stopped eating when I was full. I drank water and diet sodas as opposed to sugary coffees. I made changes that felt good rather than feeling deprived all of the time. I also introduced Metformin/Buproprion/Naltrexone to combat some side effects of my PCOS and that helped with food noise. 

I hit 140 last year and have maintained that for a few months. I’m 5 feet tall and would really like to get to a healthy BMI. I was previously working out 4-5 days a week and training for a marathon until last summer, I was diagnosed with a rare, chronic, painful condition in my breast. It makes very difficult to workout and I’m constantly fatigued as my body attempts to fight off an infection and get used to new meds. I’m essentially stopped working out but am still trying to lose weight and my efforts seem futile. I’m in this condition for the long haul, maybe for the next couple of years until a cure is found or until I’m in remission. 

Any advice? I’d hate to lose all the progress I’ve made. I’m so sad about the muscle loss already. Is it silly to try and lose weight right now? How can I be my healthiest self while getting through this illness? ",2,1771516850.0,loseit,2,0.75,False

Whether you are a novice or an experienced woodworker, detailed woodworking plans provide the blueprint you need to approach your next creation with confidence.

Choosing the right woodworking project can be exciting yet challenging. With a vast array of possibilities, consider starting with simple designs like birdhouses, coffee tables, or bookshelf organizers. Each project helps build your skill set while encouraging creativity. For more advanced practitioners, furniture making, intricate cabinetry, or home renovations can mark a rewarding challenge.

High-quality woodworking plans often include step-by-step instructions, material lists, and clear illustrations. For instance, a well-formulated plan for a dining table will guide you through selecting wood types, understanding necessary tools, and executing precise measurements. This level of detail not only enhances project success but also minimizes the risk of costly mistakes.

*   **Beginner Plans:** Birdhouses, garden benches, small storage boxes.
*   **Intermediate Plans:** Desks, chairs, and shelving units.
*   **Advanced Plans:** Complex furniture pieces, artistic wood sculptures.

Utilizing woodworking plans helps streamline the creative process. Online resources, books, and woodworking communities offer access to countless project ideas and patterns, catering to varying levels of expertise. By investing time in woodworking plans and projects, not only will your skills improve, but you’ll also enjoy the satisfaction of crafting unique items by hand.

Are there any initial directions or brands I should be looking towards? Any styles that would be best suited for an older, taller rider who just wants to get used to a daily ride? I'm looking towards a more upright style like you see in NL, but most of what I see seems to be more of a traditional 'crouched over' posture that I think would just be wildly uncomfortable for a big & round guy like me.

Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

Tuesday morning, my coworker Marcus comes over to my desk to ask about a report I was supposed to send him. Normal interaction. Routine stuff. And I guess my brain just... glitched. Because I looked up at him and said, and I quote: ""ohh did somebody need the repooort? yes they did, yes they diiiid.""

Full on sing-song voice. The whole thing. I even tilted my head a little.

There was maybe a two second pause where we both just stared at eachother. Then I think my soul left my body. I wanted to explain myself but honestly what do you even say at that point. I just slowly turned back to my computer and sent him the file without making eye contact.

Marcus is a 47 year old man with a beard. He did not react. He just said ""thanks"" and walked away and I genuinely respect him for that.

My husband thinks this is the funniest thing that has ever happened in human history. He has told this story to three people already. I have not recovered. Someone please tell me this has happend to you too because I can not go back to that office on Monday feeling like the only person who has completly lost their mind since having a baby.",50,1771516675.0,NewParents,14,0.98,False
1r92xdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/studying/comments/1r92xdh/i_had_to_write_an_essay_about_something_that/,I had to write an essay about something that genuinely stressed me out and it accidentally taught me how to actually research,"Okay so quick context without going into the full story: I got publicly called out in my Art History lecture a couple weeks ago, and then the universe decided that was not enough and assigned me a 1200-word analytical essay on the exact painter my prof humiliated me over. I'm not exaggerating when I say I sat in front of a blank Google Doc for two and a half hours the first night and produced 47 words, 30 of which were the header. I watched YouTube videos, opened a JSTOR article that was 47 pages long and immediately closed it, and made coffee that went cold while I stared at nothing. I was completely blocked, not because the topic was hard, but because my brain had attached a full stress response to this specific painter and every time I tried to write a real sentence I could hear my prof's voice in my head.



What actually got me unstuck was stopping trying to write entirely and just reading with zero pressure for like 40 minutes. No doc open, no timer, just one decent secondary source I found through Google Scholar after about 15 minutes of actually learning how to filter by date and relevance instead of just clicking the first result. I took messy notes in a notebook, not typed, just handwritten and kind of chaotic. And somewhere in there my brain stopped treating it like a punishment and started treating it like information. The essay still took me way longer than it should have and the final draft was done at 2am on Thursday, but I turned in something I actually wasn't embarrassed by. The thing I'm taking away from this is that when you're stuck its almost never about trying harder at the stuck thing. Usually you need to change the format of what youre doing completley, like switching from typing to writing by hand, or reading without the pressure of producing output at the same time. Your brain needs a side door sometimes. Also learn how to use Google Scholar filters, I genuinely did not know you could narrow results that specifically and it saved me probably an hour of reading useless stuff.",1,1771516633.0,studying,0,1.0,False

There's some hardship cuz i didn't eat properly before fajr, i only eat 1 date and a coffee and i forgot to drink water. And i feel like my throat has a sand but i made it SO HAPPY! i got to know my fellow reverts and i got a chance to get to know alot of people, it's a big achievement for me specifically I'm not used and I'm uncomfortable to talking to other people. 

I made dua in fajr asking Allah swt to give me a job(because i didn't have a job) and guess what there's a job fair near masjid so after fajr i stayed and wait for it to start and guess what guys... I got hired on the spot and i have work now! 😭

1r92w1n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r92w1n,This setup is bonkers,"Story time: After a couple of years of not owning an espresso machine, my fiancee gifted me a De’Longhi Specialista Opera last Christmas because he thought it was practical and looked cute on the counter (blessed be his pure soul). It was a bit of a downgrade from a Linea Mini and some huge ass Mazzer that my previous partner who got me into home espresso had. Still, I got that thing figured out so that I could pull a solid shot and make a latte that was arguably better than most coffee shops.

Fast forward a year later and it started leaking internally and servicing it in NY is super difficult apparently (if anyone has service recs please do let me know), so I wasted no time and got a proper setup (before he could get us another De’Longhi), risking a premature divorce and/or domestic violence for dropping 4k on a coffee setup. I was debating getting a Linea Micra but REALLY couldn’t justify the cost given we drink like 2 coffees per day before we leave for work.

Went with Eureka Atom 65W for convenience – my fiancee is not a tinkerer and he wouldn’t have used the setup if it wasn’t dead simple. Guys, GBW is an absolute game changer if you like simplicity and don’t change beans often. I was also looking at the new Mahlkonig but saw a ton of mixed reviews and didn’t like the iPad at the front and app/wifi shenanigans. Another option I was considering was the Fiorenzato but we only drink espresso based drinks so don’t need the pour-over settings, it wasn’t as readily available, had fewer reviews, and seemed a bit slower (not that those few seconds matter) and clumpy. I was also considering waiting for the Mini-G but I got impatient so I pulled the trigger on Eureka and couldn’t be happier. The mirror finish looks absurd, even tho it will be a pain to keep clean.

The Move is built like a tank, heats up quickly (one of the reasons I didn’t go for an e61 machine, along with looks) and steam goes crazy after I jacked up the temp; still getting used to all this power after a year of a sputtery thermoblock, so latte art is still a bit mid but getting there.

After a couple of gushers, got everything dialed-in nicely and been pulling perfect shots. I’m a huge fan of simplicity so been just rawdogging puck prep, no WDT or any of that nonsense (WDT didn’t even exist when I started home espresso back in 2017 lol); super fluffy grind I get from Eureka definitely helps simplify the routine. The only other accessory I’ll get is a nice leveling tamper because the included Profitec one is a bit thin and my man struggles to do a leveled tamp.

I made rules for myself like ""no music until you finish this chapter"" as if I was negotiating with a toddler. None of it worked and I kept blaming myself for it every single time.



What actually changed things was moving countries for my masters and being forced to study in cafes because my apartment was too quiet in a way that felt lonely rather than calm. And something just clicked. Background noise, other people existing nearby, the ambient hum of a coffee machine, all of it somehow let my brain settle instead of turning inward and eating itself. I started actually finishing reading sessions instead of sitting at a desk for two hours and closing my laptop with nothing done.

When most travelers think of Bosnia-Herzegovina, two iconic destinations immediately come to mind: the cosmopolitan capital of Sarajevo, rising from the ashes of war and the picturesque Mostar Bridge, draped like a jewel over the emerald Neretva River.

But in my view, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s true spirit isn’t confined to these famous spots. If you venture a little off the beaten path to the country’s western regions, you’ll discover a city just as magnificent, rich in history, culture and natural beauty. That city is Travnik, often called the ""City of Viziers.""

Nestled in the heart of the Lasva Valley, Travnik offers the grandeur of Ottoman-era architecture and the generous embrace of nature. While it may lie in the shadow of Sarajevo and Mostar, it holds a central place in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s historical and cultural memory, a must-visit for any traveler seeking authenticity.

In this guide, I’ll take you through Travnik’s narrow streets, where the aroma of coffee competes with centuries of history, where Nobel laureate Ivo Andric left his mark, and where the soothing sound of flowing water never ceases. Let’s begin our journey.

City of Viziers

Travnik is approximately a 90-kilometer (55-mile) journey from Sarajevo and sits as one of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s most treasured gems. As you approach, the Travnik Fortress, locally also called the Stari Grad (“Old Town”) Fortress, greets you, standing proudly atop a hill. This medieval stronghold has witnessed centuries of turmoil, silently guarding the city below.

Travnik earned its nickname, the ""City of Viziers,"" because it served as the capital of the Bosnian Eyalet from 1699 to 1850. Remarkably, 77 Ottoman viziers were raised here, leaving an indelible mark on the city’s architecture and cultural identity.

Minarets and colorful mosque

The Ottoman legacy in Travnik is not limited to its viziers. At the city center, your eyes are immediately drawn to a breathtaking structure: the Šarena Mosque, also known as the Alaca Mosque, dating back to the 16th century. Renowned as one of the most beautiful and colorful mosques in the Balkans, its walls are adorned with delicate plant motifs in vibrant hues, earning it the nickname “Alaca.”

The mosque’s wooden doors are intricately carved, and beneath it, the shops that once formed a bustling bazaar hint at the city’s trading past. In the courtyard, the gentle sound of flowing water adds to the serene atmosphere, a perfect place to linger and soak in the harmony of history and nature.

Plava Voda (Blue Water)

At the city’s edge flows Plava Voda, or ""Blue Water,"" a spring whose vivid color gives it its name. It’s one of Travnik’s must-visit spots. Here, I recommend trying a traditional Bosnian coffee at Lutfine Kahva, set up beside the spring. The cool, flowing water and the rich, aromatic coffee create a moment you won’t forget.

Culinary delights

No trip to Bosnia-Herzegovina is complete without tasting its cuisine. While cevapi (grilled meat rolls) are popular across the country, Travnik has a particularly famous version. Enjoy them at a small local eatery, served with lepinja bread and a special sauce, perfect fuel for climbing the fortress later.

Also, don’t miss Vlasic cheese, produced in the nearby mountain villages. Its salty, firm texture reflects the rugged, unspoiled nature of the region.

Center of learning

Travnik is famous for its many Ottoman-era mosques. Legend says you can fit 40 mosques into a single photograph. But the city’s Ottoman heritage extends beyond places of worship. The Elci Ibrahim Pasha Madrassa, built in 1705 by the Bosnian governor of the same name, remains one of the Balkans’ most important educational centers.

Entering through its grand gates and walking through its spacious courtyard, you can almost hear the echoes of scholarly discussions that once filled these walls. Unlike many madrassas now serving as museums, this institution continues to educate, bridging the past and present in a living testament to history.

Literary legacy

Travnik also holds a special place in literature. The house of Ivo Andric, Nobel Prize-winning author, is now a museum displaying his study, library and documents related to his Nobel award.

While Andric is best known for ""The Bridge on the Drina,"" his work ""Travnicka hronika"" (""Travnik Chronicle"") vividly depicts the city, portraying it as a stage where East meets West, Napoleon’s politicians collide with Ottoman viziers and tension mingles with beauty. Reading Andric before visiting allows you to truly appreciate the city’s layers of history and culture.

As Andric wrote, “People build bridges; sometimes of stone, sometimes of words.” Travnik felt like one of those bridges, a place where history, literature and human stories meet.

As the sun sets behind the Vlasic Mountains, it’s time to climb the fortress. The stone steps may challenge your legs, but the view is worth every step. From above, red-tiled roofs, mosque minarets and the winding river create a picture-perfect panorama. As you walk the ramparts and visit the fortress museum, every step transports you centuries into the past.

After exploring Travnik, it’s clear: despite lying in the shadows of larger cities, it preserves Bosnia-Herzegovina’s spirit in its purest form. As Andric once said, “Life in Travnik is as natural as the flow of water, as deep as history itself.”

So, if your journey brings you to Bosnia-Herzegovina, wander the narrow streets of Travnik, dip your hand into Plava Voda, and salute the valley from the fortress as a vizier might have centuries ago.

1r92qo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1r92qo2/long_but_please_read_and_input/,"Long, but please read and input","I need help figuring out what to do, who's the problem. I am 30f and he is 33m. We've been together since 2018, got married in 21. When we met in 2018, I became pregnant with him 1 month after meeting with our daughter. He seemed like a good guy, worked a lot, he got my family's blessing and my great grandmas ring. About six months into actually knowing him I grew doubts of us. 
He talked me into quitting my job i like because the fumes at the factory possibly not safe for pregnancy. We moved back to my home town about 35 minutes away to be closer to my family. Also he technically was being evicted for not paying rent where he was when i met him. Of course i didnt know that when i met him. But i got us a good deal on renting us a house near my family. We didnt have me get a new job and i stayed home pregnant. His junk car that he had a large payment monthly on due to bad credit broke down and he had to start using my car. It was like new, i had just got it before meeting him and signed a loan. Once we had me quit my job my mom took over the monthly payment to help us. So i was carless and had a new born and couldnt work because we couldnt afford child care and i didnt have a car. Of course we started having more problems. 

Over money and dumb things. I started getting mad we could barley afford our bills, i had no food at home to eat, and he would spend decent money every day on hiself at work. I would go to churchs for help with food and have to eat whatever i could while hes buying beer, fast food, energy drinks, new chargers if he forgot his, headache medicine, basically whatever he felt like daily. He started doing white lies about money even. While our daughter was a baby I did full care and had to sleep in our first story on a couch so her waking in the night didn't bother his sleep. If she would cry he would get angry and yell and occasionally come stomping down stairs yelling at me for taking care of her wrong and thats why shes crying. I walked on egg shells afraid of her crying. I always hated conflict. Even during the day he would get annoyed and swaddle her so hard i would get scared. It caused fights.

 Fast forward we moved into my moms basment because people i knew were whilling to give us an amazing deal on a house. It needed redone to live in it but the price and rent to own was un beatable. So we lived with my parents, him working and me basically spending every day all day working on this house. Im the handy one. I found deals on market place, my mom helped buy things, my church  people gave me our entire kitchen set up of apliances. Stove fridge microwave dishwasher. I found kitchen cabinets for free. We used my parents trailer. I did all the floors in our house, our drywall, trim. We did have the bathroom totally taken down and built it bigger. My husband did help with deconstruction all over, hes a big guy with a lot of strength but all the building was basically me. He would get off work and just try to be my cheer leader with some beer. 

We did have fights at my parents too. If they even walked to the kitchen from there bedroom he would get all pissy he could hear them walk and couldnt sleep. Mind you he woke up at like 3-4 for his job shift so this anger was from 7-9 at night whenever he would try to go to bed. So once we moved into our house i was so greatful i could quit hearing complaints of my family. It was only 6 months total staying there and renovating. But our fights continued into our new home. Money, how to treat our daughter, his daily habits, not helping me. I have taken on full accountability of our daughter, our house, our yard, i have had jobs here and there. Babysitting, hardees, working for my moms buisness. I needed jobs with complete flexibility so i could do everything else. Which is extremely hard to find and it was a few years of him having my car sobi really had no options. 
Over the years my husband switched jobs a few times and got better paying ones, were definitely sitting better than we ever did before. He used to make like 40,000 and now he makes like 80, 000. Of course bring home is less. And he has a previous son he doesnt see that gets 800 a month in child support. So were not like living great but much better. We have racked up like 30,000 in debt. Which i had none when we met and i am a FIRM believer if he would live within his means we would be fine. But ive always felt like his selfish money behavior never stoped. Once he got money he spent more. Video games became a huge problem. He would live in them once he got home and wouldnt mind spending our bill money on them and having total blow up fights every wrek. Now he has always fixed it one way or the other. With his good pay they quick loans gave him money or the small amount built in his 401k till the next time we would need it or so on. Everything is always paid. But the irresponsiblility and our fights to get there and even having to take loans to cover bills when his paycheck would have suficed has always made me furious.

 At one point it got so bad i did leave him.  For a whole day. . He had 2 3000 loans and wasnt changing his ways and we wouldnt have had rent. I am the money handler, the bill payer, and it stresses me out too much. So i left, emptied the house. I felt mad and sad and stupid for leaving over money and immediately took him back that night. We had to leave that bank, cancel the account inbetween all the debt trying to hit it. We opened a new bank and have ran from that debt. Over this course we have opened 10 credit cards in my name for our house, to get by, and 2 were just for me. Never maxed out but after years of seeing your partner get whatever they want and you get nothing, it gets to you. I wanted a way to be able to buy myself something every now and then too. The limits were 300, and never maxed out. Nothing crazy. But he doesnt take me on dates, doesnt buy me anything and i ALWAYS HEAR, i can spend whatever i want out of his pay. But if i truly ever did that, even $50 our bills wouldnt be paid because no matter what he was going to spend whatever he wanted. How could i justify buying myself something if we were in a weeks quick advance because he wont quit taking rhem so he can afford what he wants when he wants. 
And money aside , of course still fighting over our child. He has anger issues. Short temper. I was afriad to leave and have to share custody with him. He is 6 foot and im 4,11 but i couldnt count the times i thought he was too agressive towards our daughter and i went toe to toe ready to mess him up with a beating heart and pure fury in my eyes. A few times i did shove him and tell him to mess with someone who can defend there selfs. I am small but i can be scary. One time he lifted our 2 year old off the ground by her arm and whaled on her butt and ""missed and hit her back"" i went off on him and shoved him and he never has again. Its like the mama bear in me just lit up. 

I am the opposite of violent. Ive never fought with exes like this. Ive never hit a person my entire life. Ive had 5 year relationships with one single argument and absolutely no violence. Now of course i didnt actually hurt my husband he is a big guy but he learned quickly this behavior is not going to happen. Its always a fight to this day i dont let him parent. And i make it so clear he is an ahole, he doesnt know his strength, beating kids is not TEACHING THEM. and i dont need his help. Period. And i think its sad. Ibwould love help parenting if it was the right kind. If i didnt think our child would have serious issues one day. I want a dad that uses words and teaches kids right from wrong and shows them life. Not be annoyed seeming by there existence. Ive waited years saying it will be better once she is older. It is. There is no violence and i know i can only thank myself for laying down that line its not happening. But there is inside rage, annoyance, avoiding our child. He calls in exhaustion from work. I call it not wanting to actually Be a dad. 

And all these years and all these arguments and me trying to convince him he has anger problems has just gotten to me. Every time im on the brink of leaving, which he knows he does all the right things. He helps around the house, fakes being nice and not annoyed with our kid, doesn't spend money that week on video games. If ive been really laying down I just live here to serve you and take care of our daughter you don't take me anywhere or try to make me happy, he will force himself to go out once if I plan it all. 

Now in the summer we do like drinking and hanging out outside and doing some projects here and there, he has to get plastered and I like drinking but not being drunk so I only have like one or 2 so a small buzz. It was fun a few years and now I feel like I almost look at him with disgust when hes stumbles or slurs and sometimes he gets emotional when he drinks and starts annoying me like hes probably drank too much. And im embarrassed to admit. After so many years of staying i did decide to have another kid with him and went off birth control. I went back to school and got my cosmetology license. We had less fights over money, less over our daughter because he did give up a lot of trying and the anger and just basically ignores her. I guess ive been telling myself if I wasn't leaving and every marriage has problems then I wanted to complete my family I wanted. I know ive said a lot of bad, but he does act like he will do whatever to please me, he doesn't cheat or go out to bars or go hang out with friends, he talks me up to everyone and says he knows he doesn't deserve me. He has financially always figured it out for our family. He does firmly mean I could go spend his whole paycheck today if I wanted even though I know I can't. I do enjoy drinking and doing house projects.

 I know im not perfect. I do feel like I need to nag a lot. When I get angry at him for these things I do totally belittle his character while hes yelling like an idiot. and I have always been a runner when im not happy. If it wasn't for our child I know I would have left. And it doesn't matter what I do this man never wants to leave. Now I do think I am a good wife though. I take all responsibility but working full time. I do not go out, I dont have friends I see, I would never cheat or entertain anyone. Ive felt like locked in a box at home just being a good wife. So yes all of our problems aside i decided to continue trying to make another child even with the thought in the back of my mind it would end us.

 We have had infertility for almost 3 years trying. Sometimes I think its because God knows we couldn't handle it. Our maybe my body can feel it just isn't right and its stopping it from happening. I became a little obsessed. I focused less on him and my dislikes for him and more on wanting this baby. But now after these years I feel like everything is settling in and im just at a loss. Mind you the entire three years we couldn't make it through 1-2 cycles without him doing stuff wrong and me becoming furious enough I was calling it all off. One month trying, and one month avoiding it at all cost. Just back and forth. Left the fertility specialist for a few months but stayed and it started weighing heavy on me again I wanted that other child. Started trying again. Just back and forth for three years. I feel at the end of dreaming for another child and I feel like im at the end of desiring my husband. I feel like every year has been another added brick of disliking him and us. Of feeling toxic and I just know I am not a toxic person. I am not an angry person. I just think we dont mix well.

 Ive been afraid for years to leave for so many reasons and I always come back around to managing things but never feeling smitten and lucky to be here. Is this fix able ? Am I the problem for not letting things go, is he the problem for only doing good when there is a deadline. Right now asbi right this, this week he has been good trying not to lose me. Our daughter has been in school 115 days and it's the first time he got her ready for school. And yes he has been home every Monday and wendsday. Hes cleaning the house. Trying to make my morning coffee, agreed to go out to eat TWICE this month.. weve fought multiple times this month alone about his anger and tantrums is what I call them. When hes mad he has no filter. Ive tried so hard all these years to give my daughter a normal home but I am so concerned about our actual happiness. I wanted someone that brought light and happiness and goofiness to my home. Not such negativity. And at this point I have had my own salon for a year and 3 months. Ive probably made 15 000 which is like nothing and couldn't cover our bills. I could work 2 jobs because thankfully me and my mom have shared parenting for a long time now. I highly doubt I could afford my home and bills. It make me so sad to give up on my dreams of a family and 2 kids. I see single moms killing it and it truly inspires me. They are happy and thriving. But what do I do? Do I hold too much resentment, is it because im a runner, will I always want something that looks better then what I have. Would it really be more peaceful? He always says he has no complaints about me besides being hard on him and making him feel like crap about himself.

The first time he saw her he said she was the best one he’s ever been to and then went like 3 times in one week. Then it was only a couple times between then and January of this year. He hurt his back so went to see her again a couple weeks ago and was there for 3 hours which I thought was weird… I didn’t think registered massage therapists did massages that long. He then went again last week for another hour. 

When he came home from the last one he was telling me how disgusted he was because she was explaining to him how she was sort of an escort and guys would pay her lots of money to do weird things like pee on them.. which is beyond disgusting. It seemed like she was trying to feel out of that’s something he’d be into by telling him all that. 

He said he was so repulsed by her and wasn’t going to go to her anymore but then I found on his phone he was texting with her after this last massage and they were going to possibly meet up when snowboarding when I wasn’t there. 

I noticed he had deleted all of their messages so too I went to the recently deleted and recovered them all and his messages were very flirty.  He even offered to pick her up coffees or smoothies before some of his previous massages. He says it’s nothing but I dont believe him snd have lost all trust 😔",12,1771516154.0,AmIOverreacting,34,1.0,False

At the ER - I was put on IV drip, ECG, and blood test. All test was normal and no complications. I was also calmed already when I got into the hospital even before nurse gave me IV drip.

When I got the papers, doctors put GERD as a main diagnosis and was given pantoprazole 30 minute before breakfast for 7 days (i haven't taken any yet). What's your opinion on this? Thanks for answering. ",1,1771515493.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

1r92bpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenOfPurpose/comments/1r92bpl/how_to_become_cool_af_sciencebased_tricks_that/,How to Become Cool AF: Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work.,"Ok so I've spent way too much time analyzing what makes someone ""cool"" and it's not what you think. After diving deep into social psychology research, listening to Charisma on Command breakdowns, and reading Robert Greene's work on power dynamics, I realized most of us are chasing the wrong version of cool. We're trying to be mysterious edge lords or loud attention seekers when actual coolness is way more subtle and honestly way more achievable.

The uncomfortable truth? Cool people aren't performing coolness. They've just figured out how to be internally secure enough that they stop trying. Which sounds like a paradox but stick with me.

**Stop seeking validation from every interaction**

This is the foundation everything else builds on. Cool people don't need you to think they're cool, which is precisely what makes them cool. It's this weird reverse psychology thing our brains do. The moment you stop fishing for approval in conversations, stop over explaining yourself, stop checking if people laughed at your joke, you become magnetic.

Mark Manson covers this perfectly in The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (bestseller, over 10 million copies sold, brutally honest self help that doesn't sugarcoat). He basically argues that we have limited f*cks to give, so we better choose wisely what we care about. When you stop caring about appearing cool, you paradoxically become it. The book will make you question every social anxiety you've ever had. Legitimately changed how I show up in rooms.

**Develop actual competence in something**

Cool isn't an aesthetic, it's a byproduct. The genuinely cool people I know are just really good at something and happen to be chill about it. Could be graphic design, could be making people laugh, could be knowing weird facts about mushrooms. Doesn't matter. Competence creates quiet confidence which reads as cool.

Research from Stanford shows that self efficacy (belief in your ability to succeed) is built through mastery experiences, not affirmations or fake it till you make it BS. So pick something, get obsessed, get decent at it. The confidence spillover effect is real.

**Master the art of being comfortable with silence**

This one's huge. Uncool people fill every gap in conversation with noise. Cool people let moments breathe. They're not frantically searching for the next thing to say. Chris Voss talks about this in Never Split the Difference (ex FBI hostage negotiator turned negotiation expert, Wall Street Journal bestseller). He explains how silence creates psychological pressure that actually draws people in. In social settings, brief pauses make you seem more thoughtful and less desperate. Game changer for conversations.

**Stop trying to be liked by everyone**

You know what's deeply uncool? People pleasing. Having opinions that shift based on who's in the room. Cool people have edges. They'll politely disagree, they'll skip events that don't interest them, they'll be honest when something isn't their vibe. This doesn't mean being an asshole, it means having a spine.

If you want to go deeper on these psychological patterns but feel overwhelmed by all the books and research, a friend at Google actually recommended BeFreed to me. It's this smart learning app built by Columbia grads and AI experts that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. You can type in something specific like ""I want to be more socially confident without seeming desperate"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan just for you, adjusting the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice customization is honestly addictive, you can pick anything from a calm, thoughtful tone to something more energetic. Makes absorbing all this psychology research way less of a chore when you're commuting or at the gym.

Use the app Aro if you're constantly checking your phone for validation through likes and messages. It literally helps you put your phone away and be present, which is actually one of the coolest things you can do now since everyone's glued to screens. Being the person who's actually engaged IRL is basically a superpower at this point.

**Get comfortable with your own company**

People who need constant social stimulation come across as needy. Cool people can sit alone at a coffee shop without looking lost. They can go to movies solo. They're not performing for an audience 24/7. This ties back to that internal security thing.

Dr. K from HealthyGamer (Harvard trained psychiatrist, massive YouTube following, specializes in mental health for internet generation) has incredible content on building genuine self esteem vs the fake confidence most people project. His video on ""why you feel like a fraud"" absolutely destroyed me in the best way. He explains how our brains confuse social approval with self worth and how to actually separate those.

**Develop your own taste**

Stop liking things because they're trending. Cool people have specific preferences that might seem random but make total sense to them. They'll recommend a weird podcast nobody's heard of, wear something slightly off trend, have strong opinions about coffee brewing methods. It's not about being contrarian, it's about actually knowing what YOU like.

**Learn to laugh at yourself**

Taking yourself too seriously is the fastest way to seem uncool. The ability to acknowledge when you've messed up, make a self deprecating joke, and move on without spiraling shows massive security. It signals you're not fragile.

**Build genuine curiosity about others**

Here's the secret, cool people make YOU feel cool when you're around them. They ask follow up questions. They remember details from past conversations. They're not just waiting for their turn to talk. Dale Carnegie figured this out like 80 years ago in How to Win Friends and Influence People (5 million+ copies sold, still brutally relevant). His core insight, people are magnetically drawn to those who take genuine interest in them. Timeless.

Stop optimizing for cool and start optimizing for secure. The rest handles itself. Your brain will literally rewire itself through consistent practice of these behaviors, neuroplasticity is wild like that. You're capable of becoming the version of yourself that walks into rooms and just feels right. Not because you're performing anything, but because you've built a foundation that doesn't need external validation to stand on.",1,1771515276.0,MenOfPurpose,0,1.0,False

for some context:

i’m 15F, and me and my moms relationship has always been VERY rocky. she’s struggled with her mental health all my life and as a result we have a strained connection. as i got older we argue more, to the point she’s wanted to send me away and i’ve ran away. she has ADHD and i think other things however as she is an older woman in her late 40/ early 50s, i doubt she will ever get tested for anything else. 

i am the youngest of 4 daughters, my oldest being late 30s. my sisters are all ranging from their 20-30s so we all have a large age gap. 

now here’s the actual thing; for ages now ive heard her go into the bathroom at 2-5am many nights and i hear coughing noises, spluttering and yk the obvious throwing up sounds. i struggle sleeping so im awake most nights when it happens. i thought maybe she was ill. for some reason my stupid brain didn’t put together the prices - from my early childhood there were eating disorder forms and help leaflets, her constantly being on calls she called her “eating meetings.” 

my mom is not large in any way shape or form, she’s 4”10-11 and weighs about the same as me if not less. all my life i have heard her talk about weight negatively, on and off dieting, scales, numbers ect. all of my sisters also struggle with eating disorders, mostly binging for comfort because of many things in their life, but i think my mom had a lot to do with that. suprise suprise, i also really struggle with my food and since i was 10 have had some form of eating disorder, i would starve myself because i saw my mom “fasting” (she would not eat and just drink coffee) and contanstly weighed myself. now im 15, 5”2, 55kg and am really struggling with that.

all my life my mom has also commented on all of our bodies, my sisters, and me. she would say how i’m filling out nicely and how long my legs are, i should be a model, im so skinny, she’d die to be as skinny as me, she needs to lock me up, ect. she also has concerns with my unhealthy diet as i do eat a bunch of junk food lol, im a teenager though and also up until recently stuck with my safe foods (neurodivergence.) when i opened up to her about my eating disorder, she told me she knew because i dropped a lot of weight a year or two ago, and she then told me i was doing it for attention. i’ve had conversations with her about how i feel when she brings up dieting, calories or anything to do with weight and it really triggers me - her response is to nod and then continue and sometimes even exaggerate her conversations it seems, which has really hurt me many times over the years.

my sister confirmed my suspicions yesterday and i’m struggling with how i feel about it. she’s struggling, and has been for her whole life, however part of me feels just anger which i know is wrong but knowing the damage she’s inflicted on her daughters, not supporting any of us in any way, adding fuel to the fire, i feel like just angry because i know when/if she tells me about it, i will be supportive and understanding to her. yet i feel as though most of my life has been her treating me with cruelty in ways unrelated to eating disorders but just general psychological torment, and me having to look after her when she inevitably slips into a bad place which is 99% of the time. 

ive tried to get help for me and her and we’re on a waiting list for therapy at the moment. i m upset because she must be going through so much every day and maybe the reason why she’s took so many emotions out on me. she doesn’t deserve to live like this and i know she needs me help but i don’t know what to do. a small part of me that im ashamed about feels betrayed but please let me explain. she constantly calls me so skinny and tells me about my model figure, then feeds me extras and giving herself a smaller portion, then throwing it all back up. i feel like she’s competing with her own daughter. in one conversation we were comparing weights (yes, i know that’s unhealthy) and she genuinely was upset she weighed a tiny bit more than me. a 15 year old.i feel uncomfortable because it’s like just living with her is a one sided competition. like as long as i’m around i actually harm her, making herself believe she needs to weigh less than me. 

an hour ago i made us some food. i wasn’t that hungry so i had a smaller portion and gave her a NORMAL portion. she looked at it shocked and refused to eat such a massive amount and told me to eat it instead even after i said i didn’t want that much. right after she went to the toilet, i went to my room and heard her coughing gagging and vomit going into the toilet. she ran the water to cover it but i still heard. 

i’m carrying a lot of guilt as well, for possibly triggering her over the years which could be why she isn’t the nicest all the time. 

i don’t have school for another week or so, and i really would love some advice. how do i go about my day to stop my triggering behaviours while also trying to make sure she doesn’t know i figured it out. i want what’s best for her even if i don’t actually feel connected to her. she is her own person and with all she’s been through i hope if she’s happier than home will be happier for everyone. i want to be a better daughter to help her get through this. thank you for any advice",7,1771515264.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I didn't care for the color of the strap that shipped with the watch (pictured, on right), so I swapped mine out for a darker brown Nalu. Or Zuto. Something.

Anyhow, I read that the Timex strap was ""genuine leather,"" so I thought I might dye it and put it on a different watch. I soaked the original in a blend of black coffee, soy sauce, and a touch of balsamic vinegar (to enhance the red). I've used combinations of these to blend in scratches on wood furniture, and figured that it should work on the suede-ish leather on the strap.

I ended up with a strap that smells like salad dressing, but doesn't look any different.

This surprised me because it's not a gloss treated strap, and I soaked it overnight. I would have thought that this would stain anything porous, but even the inside of the strap is untouched.

The safest “can’t go wrong” gift for most men isn’t another gadget or random accessory, it’s a well-made, practical tool or appliance he’ll actually use for years.

In my experience, durability beats trend every time. A solid kitchen upgrade like a high-end dishwasher from Bosch or Miele, or something smaller like a Zojirushi rice cooker or a Vitamix blender, tends to stick around for decades. I’ve seen 20+ year old units still running strong. That’s the kind of gift that quietly proves itself over time.

If you’re on a tighter budget, brands like Whirlpool and GE usually offer reliable basics without unnecessary tech. And that’s key: fewer digital features, fewer things to break. The more screens and “smart” add-ons packed in, the more likely it is to glitch out.

Another tip people overlook: buy from a good local appliance dealer if possible. Better advice, better service, and usually easier warranty support.

	•	She doesn’t want to be told what to do.

	•	She doesn’t want me to “wait” for her.

 *Enough of the preamble, on with the ramble...*

I got his idea the other night; it’s a revenue-generating plan based on trademarking the United States itself. As we all know, big fat corporations like Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Starbucks all rake in huge profits overseas based not on the quality of their products, but on the American dream itself. Do you really think people all over the world line up for hours to get their hands on a McDonald’s Big Mac for the savory flavor? There’s only one reason all those foreigners shell out a full day’s pay to get their hands on a Quarter Pounder with Cheese or some Chicken McNuggets: because it makes them feel that much closer to the American dream.

If you don’t think it’s true, why then do people in Mexico go to Taco Bell? Why do people in France line up around the block for Starbuck’s coffee when everybody knows American coffee is an total joke? Makes sense, right?

What I propose is to trademark the United States itself. The idea is groundbreaking. American multinationals already profiting from everything American will now have to pay a branding fee of ten percent on all foreign sales. If they don’t like it, they can take it up with the International Trademark Association and its 190 member countries.

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, over $50 billion in tax revenue is lost every year to American corporations stashing international profits overseas. The truth is, more than $2 trillion (that we know of) is parked in overseas accounts right now. But let’s not fool ourselves. As far as any tax issues go, no one is ever getting their hands on that money.

Trademark proceeds from the nearly half a trillion dollars in revenue generated by American companies abroad would more than make up for this. Trademarking the USA would bypass all the international tax loopholes these companies use to avoid paying for the right to be American.

As for the $50 billion per year the trademark fees would bring in revenue to the government, that would go a long way toward padding American’s unemployment benefits, which they really need these days with so many of their jobs being shipped overseas.

The £89,000 Question

Emma Richardson sits in her Shoreditch office at 7:42 PM, watching her local hire—a £42,000-per-year executive assistant—pack up for the evening. The email backlog sits at 247 unread messages. Tomorrow's board deck remains half-finished. Richardson, who founded a Series A fintech startup in 2023, is facing what Oxford Economics termed in their 2024 labour cost analysis as ""the London Premium Trap"": the intersection of eye-watering overhead and diminishing marginal returns.

Three months ago, she made a decision that board members initially questioned. She hired two full-time virtual assistants through [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/), a Johannesburg-based agency, for a combined monthly cost of £2,400. The local hire? She's now doing strategic work that actually justifies her salary.

""I expected a compromise,"" Richardson told me over a video call from her Cape Town team's shared workspace. ""What I got was the uncomfortable realization that I'd been overpaying for mediocrity for two years.""

This isn't a story about offshoring. It's about a specific arbitrage opportunity that UK SMEs are exploiting with the precision of currency traders—and it's happening at scale in one unexpected geography.

The Economic Arbitrage: Beyond ""Cheap Labor""

The narrative around remote hiring typically centers on cost reduction, framed with the vague discomfort of exploiting developing economies. That framing misses the empirical reality entirely.

As of December 2025, the GBP/ZAR exchange rate hovers around 23.1 to 1, creating what Staffing Industry Analysts describe as ""the most favorable quality-adjusted labour arbitrage in the Anglophone market."" A South African professional earning R25,000 per month (roughly £1,080) sits comfortably within the middle-income bracket of Cape Town's economy—affording private healthcare, reliable housing, and a lifestyle comparable to a £45,000 earner in London when adjusted for purchasing power parity.

The mathematics become more compelling when you examine fully-loaded employment costs. According to financial filings from London-based SMEs analyzed by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the true cost of a £35,000 administrative hire in London includes:

• Base salary: £35,000 • Employer National Insurance: £4,067 • Pension contributions (minimum 3%): £1,050 • Workspace and equipment allocation: £8,400 (based on £700/month for desk space in Zone 2) • Recruitment and onboarding: £4,200 (amortized over 2 years) • Management overhead and productivity loss: £6,283 (conservative 18% estimate)

Total annual cost: £59,000

VAConnect's pricing model, publicly listed at £1,200-£1,600 per month for a senior virtual assistant (depending on specialization and hours), delivers a fully-vetted, managed professional for £14,400-£19,200 annually. The delta isn't £20,000. It's closer to £40,000 when you account for the hidden friction costs.

But here's where the conventional offshore narrative breaks down: quality metrics.

Dr. Helena Marais, an economist at Stellenbosch University who has studied the South African professional services export sector since 2019, points to what she calls ""the inverse correlation problem."" Her research, published in the South African Journal of Economics (Vol. 92, 2024), found that South African graduates scored in the 87th percentile globally on business English proficiency tests—higher than Ireland, and statistically indistinguishable from the UK itself.

""We're not discussing a developing market workforce. We're discussing OECD-equivalent professional training being delivered at emerging market pricing. That gap is historically unprecedented.""

The Philippines comparison is instructive. While Manila-based virtual assistants have dominated the market for a decade, a 2024 survey by Remote Work Analytics found that UK businesses experienced a 34% higher retention rate with South African hires versus Philippine hires over a 24-month period. Exit interviews cited ""cultural misalignment"" and ""communication friction"" as primary factors. India, meanwhile, has priced itself into a different market entirely—Bangalore's tech sector now commands salaries that often exceed Eastern European alternatives when adjusted for output quality and timezone alignment.

South Africa occupies a unique position: British legal legacy, GMT+2 timezone, native English proficiency in the professional class, and an economy where R25,000 monthly provides middle-class stability. That combination doesn't exist anywhere else at scale.

The Time Zone & Cultural Sync: The Two-Hour Advantage

James Whitaker, COO of a London-based legal tech firm with 47 employees, discovered the timezone benefit accidentally. His Cape Town-based financial controller was online and productive for two hours before London's 9 AM—clearing overnight queries from US clients, preparing morning briefings, and managing the administrative detritus that typically consumed his first hour.

""It's not just that she's two hours ahead,"" Whitaker explained. ""It's that she uses those two hours. By the time I'm at my desk, the fires are already out.""

GMT+2 is close enough for real-time collaboration but far enough for extended coverage. A London business operating 9 AM-6 PM gets natural overlap with a Cape Town team running 11 AM-8 PM local time—seven hours of synchronous work. Add flexible hours, and you're approaching 24-hour operational capacity without night shift premiums.

Compare this to Manila (GMT+8) or Bangalore (GMT+5:30), where real-time collaboration requires one party to work antisocial hours, degrading quality and burning out staff.

But timezone alignment is merely infrastructure. Cultural sync is the secret weapon.

South Africa's professional class grew up on British media, British legal frameworks, and British business etiquette. They understand what ""reasonably soon"" means in an email. They know that ""let's circle back"" is a polite dismissal, not a genuine request. They code-switch naturally between formal and informal registers. These aren't skills you can train in a weekend workshop.

Dr. Ravi Naidoo, a sociolinguist at the University of Cape Town, found in his 2023 research that British managers working with South African remote staff reported 41% fewer ""clarification emails"" compared to teams distributed across Southeast Asia, even when controlling for experience levels.

""There's an unspoken playbook,"" Naidoo said. ""South Africans working with British companies already know the rules. That eliminates an entire layer of friction that most distributed teams spend years trying to overcome.""

Legal and financial systems present another overlooked advantage. South Africa operates on English common law. Contract interpretation, employment frameworks, and intellectual property protections mirror UK standards far more closely than civil law jurisdictions or Asian legal systems.

""We don't translate British business. We speak it natively. That's not marketing—it's competitive advantage."" — Simone van der Merwe, Senior Executive Assistant, [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/)

VAConnect: The Institutional Standard

The virtual assistant industry suffers from a quality assurance problem. Freelancer platforms offer access to thousands of candidates, but no curation. Staffing agencies provide vetting, but often lack sector-specific expertise. The market has bifurcated into two extremes: ultra-cheap generalists and premium boutique firms charging London rates.

[VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/), founded in 2018 by former recruitment executives Thabo Mokoena and Sarah Chen, positioned itself as the institutional solution—the agency corporate finance teams could present to their boards without embarrassment.

Their model centers on what they term ""Top 1% Vetting,"" a filtering process documented on their website and verified through client testimonials on Trustpilot (4.8/5 stars from 287 reviews as of December 2025). Candidates undergo:

1. English Proficiency Assessment: IELTS 7.5 minimum or equivalent, with business writing samples evaluated by former editors from South African financial publications 2. Technical Skills Battery: Role-specific evaluations (e.g., advanced Excel for financial VAs, SEO analytics for marketing roles) 3. Cultural Fit Interview: Conducted by UK-based managers who assess communication style, problem-solving approach, and ability to work autonomously 4. Reference Verification: Three professional references, with direct outreach and structured questioning 5. Trial Period Performance: Two-week paid trial with daily deliverable reviews

According to data shared by VAConnect's head of operations, their acceptance rate sits at 1.8%—tighter than many management consulting graduate programs.

The results show up in retention metrics. While industry-wide data from the International Association of Virtual Assistants suggests median client relationships last 11 months, [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) reports an average engagement duration of 28 months. Sixty-three percent of clients who started with one VA have expanded to multi-person teams.

Take the case of Meridian Capital, a London-based investment advisory with £180 million under management. In March 2024, they hired a single VAConnect assistant to handle client reporting and compliance documentation. By November 2025, they employed four South African staff across investor relations, research support, and financial operations—all managed through VAConnect's infrastructure.

Mark Thornhill, Meridian's managing partner, was candid about his initial skepticism: ""I thought we'd get someone who could file documents and maybe draft basic emails. What we got was a team member who understood IRR calculations, could build DCF models, and wrote client communications indistinguishable from our London staff. The second hire was easier to justify than the first.""

VAConnect's Trustpilot reviews reveal a pattern. Clients consistently mention three elements: speed of integration (median time to full productivity: 12 days), proactive problem-solving (80% of reviews mention VAs identifying process improvements unprompted), and communication quality (the phrase ""better than my last local hire"" appears in 34% of reviews).

The pricing structure reflects this positioning. At £1,200-£1,600 monthly for full-time senior assistants, [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) isn't competing with Fiverr freelancers. They're undercutting London recruitment agencies who charge £35,000+ in annual salary plus fees, while delivering what clients describe as equivalent or superior quality.

The Human Element: Bridging the Distance

The uncomfortable truth about remote work is that it fails most often not on technical grounds, but human ones. Zoom fatigue is real. Cultural distance breeds misunderstanding. The absence of physical presence creates trust deficits.

South African VAs working with UK clients operate with a structural advantage: they're not trying to overcome cultural distance. They're exploiting cultural proximity.

Dr. Amanda Foster, an organizational psychologist at London Business School, tracked 200 remote working relationships over 18 months. ""The UK-South Africa pairing consistently outperformed on trust metrics,"" Foster explained. ""South African remote workers scored higher on 'perceived reliability' and 'cultural understanding' than any other offshore location. That includes Ireland, which has zero time difference and identical language.""

The reason lies in what Foster calls ""asymmetric cultural competence."" South Africans grow up consuming British media, learning British history, and operating within British institutional frameworks. British managers don't need to learn South African business culture—it's already been adapted.

This manifests in small, cumulative ways. A Cape Town VA knows that a British client saying ""That's interesting"" about a proposal probably means ""That's terrible."" They understand the calendar implications of bank holidays. They've heard of Pret A Manger, PMQs, and the Northern Line. These micro-competencies eliminate the constant low-level friction that degrades productivity in other remote arrangements.

Rebecca Lawson, founder of a 12-person digital marketing agency in Bristol, has built her entire operational model around a team split evenly between London and Cape Town. Her approach includes monthly video ""coffee chats"" (no agenda, just connection), an annual in-person gathering in either location, and ""culture briefings""—short documents her Cape Town team creates to explain UK cultural references that come up in client work.

""My Cape Town team understands British culture better than some of my British employees. But I still invest in making them feel like part of the team, not just supporting the team. That distinction matters.""

Lawson's retention data supports the investment. Over four years, she's lost zero South African staff to competitors, while her London team has churned three times.

The human element extends to career development. [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) and similar agencies have started offering training programs that mirror UK professional development standards—advanced Excel courses taught by former City analysts, copywriting workshops led by ex-advertising creatives, and project management certifications aligned with PRINCE2 methodology.

Ncedisa Dlamini, a senior executive assistant who has worked with three different London-based clients over five years, describes the dynamic clearly: ""I earn middle-class money in Cape Town while building skills that would qualify me for senior roles in London. My clients get London-quality work at Cape Town prices. Everyone's incentives are aligned.""

Executive Support: The £120,000 Savings Question

The most direct application of the South African remote model is executive assistance—and it's where the economic case becomes almost absurdly compelling.

A senior executive assistant in London's financial district commands £45,000-£65,000 in base salary. Add employer costs, and you're at £60,000-£85,000 fully loaded. A PA to a FTSE 250 CEO can easily exceed £90,000 all-in.

VAConnect's senior executive assistant tier, priced at £1,600 monthly, delivers £19,200 annually. The savings delta: £40,800 to £70,800 per role.

But the question isn't whether you save money. It's whether you save money while maintaining standards—or ideally, improving them.

Charlotte Bennett, CFO of a London-based Series B SaaS company, replaced her £52,000 executive assistant with two [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) senior VAs in April 2024. The split: one focused on calendar, travel, and logistics; the second on board materials, investor relations, and financial reporting support.

""I initially thought of it as a cost-saving exercise,"" Bennett said. ""Six months in, I realized I'd accidentally solved a capacity problem. One person, no matter how good, can't provide the coverage a scaling executive needs. Two people, well-coordinated, create redundancy and specialization.""

Bennett's inbox response time improved from an average of 4.7 hours to 47 minutes. Her board decks started arriving 48 hours before meetings instead of the night before. Total annual cost for both VAs: £38,400. Savings versus the single London hire: £21,600. Functional output increase: roughly 200%.

The executive support model also scales in ways that local hiring doesn't. Adding a second or third VA is a £1,200-£1,600 monthly decision, not a £60,000 annual commitment. That flexibility allows businesses to match support capacity to actual need rather than budgetary constraints.

Meridian Capital's Mark Thornhill described his evolution: ""We started with one VA doing investor reporting. Within six months, we realized we could afford a dedicated research assistant, a compliance coordinator, and an operations manager—all for less than we'd pay two London hires. The leverage is extraordinary.""

The evidence suggests remote VAs can handle nuanced, high-trust executive support—with caveats. Tasks requiring physical presence remain impossible. Everything else—calendar management, travel booking, expense processing, email screening, presentation building, research, project coordination—translates seamlessly to remote execution.

In fact, some executives argue remote VAs perform better at certain tasks. They're not distracted by office politics. They don't get pulled into ad hoc conversations. They work in deeper focus blocks.

""My Cape Town EA responds to my emails faster than my COO who sits 20 feet away,"" one London CEO told me, requesting anonymity. ""She's not in meetings all day. She's not 'just popping out for coffee.' She's at her desk, executing.""

Digital Marketing & Content: Where Quality Meets Velocity

If executive support represents the obvious use case, digital marketing and content creation is where the South African advantage becomes multiplicative.

London's content marketing costs have reached absurd levels. A competent content writer with SEO knowledge commands £35,000-£45,000. A social media manager with paid advertising experience: £38,000-£50,000. A graphic designer who can execute brand work: £32,000-£48,000. Build a minimal in-house content team and you're at £110,000+ in salary alone, before workspace and overhead.

[VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) and similar agencies offer specialized marketing VAs at £1,400-£1,800 monthly. A full three-person content team: £4,800 monthly, or £57,600 annually. The savings: £52,400+.

The South African content ecosystem has evolved specifically to serve UK and US markets. Johannesburg and Cape Town host dozens of agencies and freelancers who've spent years learning British content conventions, SEO best practices, and platform-specific strategies.

Olivia Hartley, head of marketing at a London-based B2B software company, rebuilt her entire content operation around South African talent in mid-2024. Her team now consists of two Cape Town-based content writers, one designer, and one social media specialist—all sourced through VAConnect.

""The first drafts I received were indistinguishable from what our previous London-based writer produced,"" Hartley said. ""Actually, that's not quite right. They were better. Tighter structure, better keyword integration, cleaner prose. I stopped editing and started just approving.""

Her content output doubled within three months. Blog posting frequency increased from twice weekly to daily. Social media presence expanded from LinkedIn-only to cross-platform. Design turnaround dropped from 5-day to same-day for most assets. Total cost increase: zero. She reallocated her existing marketing budget.

Hartley's team now produces 47 pieces of content monthly versus 18 pre-transition. Cost per asset: £81, down from £243. Organic traffic increased 127% year-over-year, with the business closing three enterprise deals in Q4 2025 that originated from organic search—a channel that previously contributed zero pipeline.

The sweet spot for South African content teams: written content, design work, social media management, email marketing, and SEO strategy—the core of most B2B content operations.

Financial Operations: The Compliance Edge

The least obvious but potentially highest-impact application of South African VAs sits in financial operations—a domain where quality failures carry regulatory consequences.

UK financial regulations, tax compliance, and reporting standards demand precision. Errors aren't just costly—they're potentially illegal. This should make finance the last function a business would offshore.

Yet [VAConnect's](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) fastest-growing segment is financial support: bookkeepers, accounts payable/receivable specialists, financial analysts, and compliance coordinators. The reason: South Africa's professional accounting standards mirror UK frameworks more closely than any other offshore market.

South Africa uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the same framework that governs UK financial reporting. The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) maintains reciprocal recognition with UK accounting bodies. A South African CA qualification translates directly to UK equivalency.

David Winters, CFO of a mid-sized manufacturing firm in Birmingham, hired a VAConnect financial controller in August 2024 to handle monthly close, management reporting, and VAT compliance. The hire holds a SAICA qualification and previously worked for a Big Four firm's Johannesburg office.

""I was prepared to do significant training on UK tax specifics,"" Winters said. ""Turned out she already knew more about VAT reverse charge mechanisms than our previous bookkeeper who'd been doing it for six years.""

The financial operations use case extends beyond compliance to analysis. Winters' team now produces weekly cash flow forecasts, margin analysis by product line, and scenario modeling for pricing decisions—work that previously happened quarterly, if at all, because his London-based finance team lacked capacity.

For businesses operating cross-border, the South African timezone advantage becomes crucial. A Cape Town-based finance team can handle European close processes in the morning, then shift to US-facing tasks in the afternoon, creating genuine follow-the-sun financial operations without night shift premiums.

The data security question is legitimate. [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) and similar agencies have responded with infrastructure: ISO 27001 certification, GDPR-compliant data handling protocols, cloud-based systems maintaining UK data residency, and NDA frameworks carrying legal weight in both jurisdictions. Most critically, South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), enacted in 2021, creates privacy protections functionally equivalent to GDPR.

Thomas Webb, a compliance attorney at a London law firm, reviewed VAConnect's data handling protocols as part of his firm's due diligence. His assessment: ""It meets the standard we'd expect from any UK-based outsourcing provider. The geographic location is irrelevant from a compliance perspective.""

The Coordination Challenge: Managing What You Can't See

The economic case for South African VAs is empirically robust. The quality evidence is compelling. But none of it matters if you can't manage effectively across 9,000 kilometers.

The businesses succeeding with South African teams have converged on several operational patterns:

Daily Stand-ups, Done Right: Not hour-long meetings, but 15-minute video check-ins focused on blockers, priorities, and quick wins. The best teams run these at 9 AM London time (11 AM Cape Town)—late enough that the Cape Town team has already been productive for two hours, early enough that London can course-correct for the day.

Written Communication as Default: Slack, email, or project management tools become the primary communication channel, with video reserved for complex discussions or relationship-building. This forces clarity and creates a searchable record.

Clear Deliverables Over Hours Worked: The shift from ""be online 9-to-5"" to ""complete these specific outputs"" eliminates timezone anxiety and focuses on results. One founder described his epiphany: ""I stopped caring when my Cape Town assistant was online and started caring only about whether my inbox was at zero and my decks were ready.""

Invest in the First Two Weeks: The initial integration period predicts long-term success. Businesses that dedicate time to thorough onboarding, process documentation, and regular early-stage check-ins see faster time-to-productivity and higher retention.

VAConnect and similar agencies have started offering management training for clients—teaching London-based founders who've never managed remote teams how to communicate effectively and build trust across distance.

The hidden insight: many UK managers are terrible at delegation and process documentation because they've never had to be good at it. When your team sits 10 feet away, you can micromanage in real-time. When they're in Cape Town, you must communicate clearly upfront. That discipline often improves the entire business.

""Hiring remotely forced me to actually document our processes,"" admitted one London startup CEO. ""Turns out I'd been carrying half our operational knowledge in my head. Now everything's written down, and even my London team onboards faster.""

The Regulatory Question: What Happens When HMRC Comes Knocking?

The tax and employment law implications of hiring South African VAs remain one of the most frequent concerns raised by UK businesses—and one of the most misunderstood.

A UK business contracting with a South African VA through an agency like [VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) is engaging in B2B services, not employment. The VA is employed by the South African entity. The UK business is purchasing services, not hiring staff.

UK employment law—including IR35 determinations, employer National Insurance, pension auto-enrollment, and holiday pay—applies only to employees or deemed employees. A properly structured B2B service contract falls outside this scope. The critical elements that maintain this distinction:

• The VA works for multiple clients (or could, contractually) • The VA uses their own equipment and workspace • The UK business directs outcomes, not methods • The contract can be terminated without employment law process • Payment is for services rendered, not for being employed

Jane Morrison, a tax partner at a mid-tier London accounting firm, explained: ""The structure is materially identical to hiring a UK-based freelance consultant or contracting with a marketing agency. As long as the service is delivered outside the UK and the VA isn't physically working from UK premises, there's no PE risk and no UK employment relationship.""

VAT implications are similarly straightforward—services provided by a non-UK entity to a UK business are typically subject to the reverse charge mechanism, which for most businesses is VAT-neutral. South Africa's POPIA creates adequacy for GDPR data transfers, meaning UK businesses can share personal data with South African service providers with standard data processing agreements.

For the vast majority of UK SMEs, the regulatory risk of hiring South African VAs is functionally zero when structured through established agencies with proper contracts.

The Infrastructure Bet: South Africa's Unreliable Reputation

The elephant in the room: South Africa's infrastructure challenges. Load shedding, inconsistent internet connectivity, and political uncertainty create legitimate concerns.

Here's what actually happens on the ground. Professional VAs working for UK clients have universally invested in backup power—inverters, battery systems, and generators are standard equipment. Internet connectivity follows a similar pattern: fiber-to-home coverage in Cape Town and Johannesburg's professional suburbs is extensive, with multiple ISPs and mobile hotspots as backup.

Data from VAConnect's operations team shows the actual impact. Over the 12 months from December 2024 to November 2025, the median unplanned downtime per VA was 2.3 hours—slightly better than the UK median of 2.7 hours.

Load shedding, paradoxically, creates more infrastructure discipline than reliable grids. When power cuts are scheduled and predictable, you invest in backup systems. When power is reliable 99% of the time, you don't—so the 1% failure has larger impact.

Economic precarity also cuts both ways from a retention standpoint. A South African professional earning £1,200 monthly has extraordinary incentive to retain that income stream. Turnover among South African VAs working for UK clients runs dramatically lower than UK domestic hiring.

One executive described it bluntly: ""My London assistant left for a £5,000 raise. My Cape Town assistant would never leave for an equivalent rand increase because there isn't equivalent work in Cape Town at any price. The retention game theory is completely different.""

The Second-Order Effect: What This Means for UK Employment

If South African VAs are systematically superior in cost-effectiveness to UK hires for an expanding range of roles, what happens to UK employment?

The roles being shifted to South African teams—executive assistance, content creation, bookkeeping, customer support, design, marketing coordination—represent hundreds of thousands of UK jobs.

The counter-argument is that cost savings get reinvested in UK-based strategic roles. Some businesses genuinely do this—Emma Richardson's £40,000 in annual VA savings funded a product manager role that accelerated her roadmap. Others simply bank the savings, improving margins without expanding headcount.

What's certain is that UK SMEs face a stark choice: arbitrage the cost differential now while it exists, or watch competitors do it first and gain margin advantage. The window won't remain open indefinitely—South African wages are rising, and UK businesses may eventually saturate demand and drive up pricing.

For now, though, the window is wide open.

The South African virtual assistant market represents something historically unusual: a genuine quality-adjusted arbitrage in professional services that shows no signs of closing. The combination of currency dynamics, cultural proximity, timezone alignment, and institutional development has created an opportunity that UK SMEs are exploiting with increasing sophistication.

[VAConnect](https://vaconnect.co.uk/) and agencies like it aren't selling cheap labor. They're selling London-equivalent professional capability at one-third the cost, with fewer coordination frictions than most UK businesses experience with local hires.

The businesses that have made this transition describe it in strikingly similar terms: initial skepticism, rapid conversion after trial periods, expansion from one VA to multi-person teams, and a dawning realization that they'd been overpaying for mediocrity without knowing it.

The question isn't whether this model works. The data, the case studies, and the retention metrics make that clear. The question is how quickly UK SMEs will recognize that their competitors have already made the switch—and are operating with 30-40% lower overhead while delivering equivalent or superior output.

In an economy where margin compression is killing businesses and London costs are spiraling, that differential isn't minor. It's existential.

The uncomfortable truth: UK businesses that continue hiring locally for roles that can be executed remotely aren't making a quality choice. They're making an expensive habit look like a strategy.",1,1771514689.0,u_VA-Connect,0,1.0,False

He started whining a bit, but he went back to the couch. But then my aunt chimed in. She said, oh come on, dont be stingy. Hes bored. Just let him play for 30 minutes.

I explained again that i have important work files on there and i dont let kids use it. i offered to put the tv on for him instead.

My aunt got annoyed. She stood up and said, u are a grown woman, why do u even need a computer like that? Hes a child and he wants to play. You are being selfish.

She actually walked over to the desk and tried to turn the monitor on. I snapped. I stood between her and the desk and told her she needed to leave right now. i said she was being disrespectful to my home and my property.

She started screaming that i was treating family like trash over a stupid toy. She grabbed her kid and stormed out.

Now my mom is calling me saying i was too harsh and i should have just let him play to keep the peace. She says i embarrassed her sister.

A few questions. I am a senior at a T-20 undergrad majoring in econ and public policy. I was thinking I wanted to go KJD until December, then had a change of heart and decided to take a gap year. Because of that, I missed many of the bigger post-grad paralegal two-year program application dates.

I have applied to 51 paralegal roles to date, had 15 coffee chats that led to referrals, and many of those firms are smaller boutique-level (although have had solid referrals into the big law programs from referrals from people i actually personally know). I have congressional intern experience, experience at two law firms, startup experience, and solid pre-law extracurriculars. I am starting to go crazy. I know this job cycle is a numbers game, but I am genuinely getting terrified. It is February of my last senior semester and I desperately need a job before I graduate. Is there something I'm missing? Any advice helps. 

Does anyone know of any 1–2 year paralegal pre-law school programs anywhere in Seattle or NYC that are still open/ will drop soon?  I am starting to think I have missed all of them. I refresh Handshake and LinkedIn every day and apply when a new one pops up, but they are few and far between. Can someone please help? Why am I not getting a single interview? I know it is a competitive market, but I need some guidance.

Thank you in advance.

My first week was filled with confusion. Coffee breaks every couple of hours seemed like a waste of time at first! But then I realized these pauses weren’t distractions. They were essential resets for our brains. Workdays are organized around respect for personal boundaries here. Chatting in the break room often feels more meaningful than the actual meetings that follow. Knowing that you can spark up conversations over waffles or buns is magic. It transformed how I view relationships at work. I mean, who’d have thought ergonomics and buttered rye would be key ingredients in boosting productivity? I'm oddly grateful for this shift. It reminds me we’re humans first and employees second. Anyone else feeling like less grind equals more creativity? Let's share some hacks!",1,1771514358.0,workandlife_finland,0,1.0,False
1r91wmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationalPatterns/comments/1r91wmg/10_things_introverts_crave_in_relationships_but/,10 things introverts CRAVE in relationships but rarely ask for (until it’s too late),"Let’s be real. So many relationships crash because people just don’t get how introverts operate emotionally. It’s not about being shy or anti-social. It’s about energy, boundaries, and wanting depth over noise.

A lot of introverts spend too much time “adjusting” until they hit emotional burnout. This post is for anyone who’s introverted (or loves someone who is) and wants to build something healthy without resentment sneaking in later. It’s based on evidence-backed psychology and insights pulled from books, podcasts, research studies, and therapy tools.

Here’s what introverts actually need to feel loved and safe in relationships:

**1. Space to recharge**  
Introverts aren’t built for nonstop connection. After socializing or even deep emotional convos, they need alone time. According to Susan Cain’s book *Quiet*, introverts experience more neural stimulation and need breaks to regulate. It’s not rejection, it’s restoration.

**2. Deeper conversations over constant chatter**  
Small talk is draining. Shallow convos over text or constant check-ins can feel like emotional noise. A study from the University of Arizona found that people who have fewer but deeper conversations report higher life satisfaction, especially true for introverts.

**3. Respect for their quietness**  
Silence isn’t a problem to solve. It’s an emotional pause. Research by Dr. Laurie Helgoe shows that introverts use silence to process, reflect, and connect internally. Don’t take it personally.

**4. Emotional safety, not just chemistry**  
Introverts often have a rich inner world. To share that takes trust. According to the Gottman Institute, emotional attunement, where a partner truly listens and validates, is key for introverts to open up.

**5. Time to think before responding**  
Introverts hate being rushed to talk. Their mind works deeply, not instantly. This was highlighted in Adam Grant's podcast *WorkLife*, where he explains that introverts pause not because they’re unsure, but because they process more information before speaking.

**6. Low-stimulation environments**  
Romantic dates don’t have to be loud or intense. Think books, walks, coffee shops, or deep convos in cozy rooms. Environments matter, studies on sensory processing sensitivity (Aron & Aron, 1997) show that introverts can get overwhelmed quickly in noisy settings.

**7. Independence without guilt**  
Introverts need to do things alone sometimes, not to escape, but to recharge. Being clingy or misreading that as “pulling away” creates pressure. Relationship therapist Nedra Tawwab emphasizes the need for healthy separateness in strong couples.

**8. Slower pace in communication**  
Fast texting, constant calls, and emotional intensity right away? Too much. Introverts usually do better with slow, meaningful connection. Not ghosting, just no pressure to be “ON” 24/7.

**9. Thoughtful intimacy over constant affection**  
Introverts often express love through actions and deep presence, not just physical affection. A study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found introverts are more likely to show care through listening and shared quiet time.

**10. Permission to be themselves**  
They don't want to be “fixed” or dragged into extroverted ideals. The healthiest relationships let introverts just be, without pressure to talk more, go out more, or change their core.

Relationships don’t fall apart from lack of love. They fall apart from misreading energy. Learn how your partner recharges, and you’re halfway to emotional fluency.",1,1771514333.0,RelationalPatterns,0,1.0,False

I really like this coffee, but curious if anyone knows of other brands? I tried searching Amazon, but really didn’t find much. 

I do like the idea of filter bags and grounds of my choosing.

Keep in mind I’m not a coffee snob, I just like cold coffee over drinking it hot.

I limit my Starbucks to once a week, but would prefer to shut it down completely.

1. My school bestfren abandoned me for a guy she was dating. He disrespected me infront of her and she did nothing to stop him. I left and didn’t talk to her for 2 years while she kept reaching out, finally we got back together. 

Again, she started dating this guy, I’d spend hours and hours talking to her whenever he’d make her cry, cheated on her. She vanished again, she’d vanish everytime she was doing good in life and got back with the same guy. Meanwhile someone really close to me in my family passed away. It took me months of crying and sleepless nights to recover. She never reached out, not a single text. Later I discovered that she’d moved to a different country and hid her stories from me and here I thought she was going through a tough time and kept reaching out to her.

2. This other school friend, basically leeches off me. I moved away for college and every semester break, I’d bring her gifts. Never gave me a chocolate on my birthday even. We’d go out and I’d pay everytime cause I felt that if she’s giving me a ride, I’d atleast pay. The only time she offered to pay and later claimed she had no money, so I ended up paying. 

She only reaches out if she wants to get something done. We’d go on runs everyday and she’d ask me to wake her up, spend like 5 minutes to convince her to come along. Even on days we didn’t go, she’d want me to wake her up cause I’m an early riser aha. She won’t meet me on the main road instead I’d to take a detour and wait for her to get ready, at her place. No communication apart from this, even though we’d meet everyday. I don’t find refuge in her. I don’t like to share things with her, cause every single plan I’ve told her about, it never ended up happening😀. 

This one time, she got all panicky that her parents are planning to get her married and asked me to get her a job. I asked this friend of mine, who works in talent acquisition for leads, mind you he works 12+ hours a day, still spent his time creating a CV from scratch for someone he didn’t even know. As soon as 

Madamji got her CV, she went no contact again, no updates even.

On my birthday, we went to this place, and the plan was to explore around for like 2 hours and have dinner aka my birthday treat at 7pm. She was hungry since morning😀. Legit asked me to get her burgers and coffee packed to eat beforehand. I paid for the tickets plus. She didn’t even let me decide where to eat fyi birthday bhi mera, treat meri, aur paise bhi mujhe hi dene. Still won’t agree to what I wanted to have. And subtly overshadowed me. 

Now it’s her birthday next month, she hasn’t reached out apart from asking me to go on runs with her again(an excuse to make me her alarm clock again). Should I get back at her, on her birthday?",3,1771514299.0,AskIndianWomen,4,0.81,False

A small lake in Chautauqua County popular for fishing, swimming and boating and the land around it will be protected from future development if the Western New York Land Conservancy can raise enough money to reach its next goal.

The Land Conservancy is trying to raise $900,000 to purchase, maintain and protect Bear Lake and much of the land around it in Chautauqua County.

The additional funds are needed on top of the $675,000 state grant the land trust was awarded in December by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

In total, [the Bear Lake Preserve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_incqKpZE) would cover 311 acres. The land targeted by the conservancy, located off Bear Lake Road in the town of Stockton, is currently privately owned.

Northtowns Cardiology at 190 Maple Road, at the corner of North Maplemere Road, is planning to construct a narrow 2,080-square-foot rectangular addition across the north end of its building, creating space for six additional exam rooms. That will add to its 11,000-square-foot one-story medical building.

Separately, St. Paul's Lutheran Church wants to construct a 950-square-foot addition to the central front facade of its 15,750-square-foot building at 4001-4007 Main St. The addition would create a community room to serve coffee for the 200-seat church. The southeast corner of the 87-space parking lot will also be redesigned so it can host a food truck on Mondays.

[Indus Hotels project halted by Lancaster development moratorium - Buffalo Business First](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2026/02/18/lancaster-development-moratorium-indus-hotels.html)

The Lancaster Town Board has put a halt to a proposed hotel project — at least for the time being — after passing a new development moratorium. Now town officials are bracing for a lawsuit from the developer.

""I'm sure they're going to put in a lawsuit,"" Town Clerk and Deputy Supervisor Diane Terranova told Business First. ""The town attorney is going to take a look at that.""...

The parcel where Indus wants to build is in the town's general commercial zone, and the town's code explicitly says hotels and motels are permitted uses in that zone. The hotel would be next door to a Red Roof Inn and a stone's throw from Hospitality Inn, La Quinta Inn and The Garden Place Hotel, all of which sit on the same intersection.

""We're just trying to get a good project done in the community,"" Indus CEO Jett Mehta said in an interview held before the moratorium vote.

(This is idiotic... I hope the developer sues the pants off the town and gets to build their hotel asap.)

**Costco** doesn't comment on new stores until a few days before opening, but Town of Amherst officials have said this highly anticipated Washington-based warehouse club will open in early August.

Time is short for the **Boulevard Mall** as we know it. The Town of Amherst is working through the eminent domain process, which is expected to take about four months and will pave the way for the property's dramatic overhaul. Benderson Development will then take title of the mall, which will allow the developer to begin at least partial demolition.

The **Eastern Hills Mall** hit a snag with the site's sewer capacity, which is not capable of handling the amount of residential development planned for the project. Earlier this month, Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state will give the project the $30 million in aid it needs for the sewer upgrades.

""The timing of future announcements is closely tied to achieving further clarity and commitments regarding the infrastructure improvements required to support a project of this scale,"" Weisz said.

""With $3 million in design and engineering already underway, the securing of $30 million in state funding remains essential to unlocking more than $1 billion in private investment and generating millions in long term tax revenue for the region,"" he said.

Now, a decade later at **Station 12**, things are back on track with new construction, a slew of store openings announced and the first stores expected to open by fall.

Among the new stores are Tempur-Pedic mattress and bedding store; Warby Parker optical store; The North Face outdoor apparel; cooking store Williams Sonoma; home decor store Pottery Barn; workshare space Industrious; clothing stores Evereve, Anthropologie, Alo Yoga, FP Movement and Anthropologie; strength training center \[solidcore\]; jewelry stores Gorjana and Rowan; and restaurants Just Salad, Oola Bowls and Black & Blue Steak and Crab.

(The other one is the factory outlet, which isn't doing very well)

By [*u/Lacroix\_Fan*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lacroix_Fan/)

*(See the FAQ entry:* [*What is Egoism?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullegoism/comments/1nxs46w/what_is_egoism/)*)*

**Common Translations:** [Egoism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egoism) (Steven Byington/David Leopold; Wolfi Landstreicher).

**Stirner’s Usage:** Egoism \[[Egoismus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Egoismus)\] denotes one’s inability to act selflessly—even, e.g., one’s altruistic devotion to a [**cause**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullegoism/comments/1r77yjz/cause_thing_concern_affair_sache/) ultimately arising in oneself, because one has nothing but oneself to arise causes from—and the *accidental* and *willful* tendency within this inability to appropriate, towards one’s ends, all things within one’s **power**: for instance, to place one’s coffee mug in a spot one finds more pleasing, or to dispense with the belief that one ought not to do all things for oneself. Egoism is not a higher state to be achieved, \[1\] nor is it “human nature”, nor is it a canny “self-interest”; \[2\] it is simply a natural power, one’s relationship with their world. Stirner utilizes this natural power to willfully live without considering any cause greater than his **own**, without any misconception that he might ever be anything but egoistic. Confusingly, this way of life too is called egoism, and whether the former or latter definition is being referred to must be gleaned from context.

**Key Excerpts:**

* “Sacred things exist only for the egoist who doesn’t recognize himself, the involuntary egoist, for the one who is always out for his own, and yet does not consider himself the highest essence, \[…\] but however much he shakes and chastises himself, in the end he does everything for his own sake, and the disreputable egoism never gives way in him. This is why I call him the involuntary egoist.” ([The Possessed ](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#toc15:~:text=Sacred%20things%20exist,the%20involuntary%20egoist.)[¶](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#:~:text=We%20are%20indeed%20supposed%20to%20have%20spirit%2C%20but%20spirit%20is%20not%20supposed%20to%20have%20us.)[12](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#toc15:~:text=Sacred%20things%20exist,the%20involuntary%20egoist.))
* “\[T\]he egoist, indeed, never strives for any thing for the thing’s sake: the thing must serve him. It is egoistic to ascribe no value of its own, no ‘absolute’ value to a thing, but rather to seek its value in me.” ([Ownness ¶38:3–4](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#fn_back183:~:text=the%20egoist%2C%20indeed%2C%20never%20strives%20for%20any%20thing%20for%20the%20thing%E2%80%99s%20sake%3A%20the%20thing%20must%20serve%20him.%20It%20is%20egoistic%20to%20ascribe%20no%20value%20of%20its%20own%2C%20no%20%E2%80%9Cabsolute%E2%80%9D%20value%20to%20a%20thing%2C%20but%20rather%20to%20seek%20its%20value%20in%20me.))
* “Morality is not compatible with egoism, because it doesn’t accept *me*, but only the humanity in me.” ([The Owner ¶24:5](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#toc15:~:text=Morality%20is%20not%20compatible%20with%20egoism%2C%20because%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20accept%20me%2C%20but%20only%20the%20humanity%20in%20me.))

**Feuerbachian Context & Distinctions:** Stirner inherits this term from Feuerbach, who put forward a universal (“Humanism”), yet excluded egoism from it. \[3\] Stirner rhetorically utilizes this term to show that the full brunt of a person is always excluded from higher ideals, such as Humanity, Morality, and Individualism. To Stirner, one may indeed be human, moral, and an individual, but there is much more to oneself than any of these universals. \[4\]

In fact, Stirner—inspired by animal psychologist Peter Scheitlin’s work, ‘*Complete Science of The Animal Soul*’ (1840)—took inhuman animals and children as prime examples of egoists, merely by dint of their cognitive inabilities to hold parts of their own worlds above themselves as **sacred**. 

**Concrete Example:** A child, a priest, and Stirner walk into a bar. The child will egoistically see the other two’s argument as hers to ignore, and instead delight herself toying with emptied bottles. The priest will—even though his sacred devotion be self-sacrificing—egoistically strive to satisfy his pride by proving this devotion, seeing Stirner’s beliefs as his own to influence. Stirner is the only one in this group who knows he is behaving egoistically, calls himself such, and will either argue with the priest, join the child’s game, or abandon both for greener pastures, only as he sees fit.

“Holy shit.” I was still half asleep, thinking maybe I was still dreaming as I teetered on the edge of the deep end, an icy March wind whipping at my face. 

I’d only ventured outside to check if the pool was covered. 

It wasn’t. Well, it was. Nicholas insisted he’d covered it the night before. 

He was semi-correct; the cover was secure. Well, except for the giant fucking hole burned through the middle. 

The pool cover was scorched, flecks of debris drifting lazily in the breeze, speckled across ripples. 

A quick glance at the cloudy sky told me there’d been no storm. No lightning. No… freak accident. My thoughts whirred. 

What could possibly cause that amount of damage? 

Did an animal do this? Nope. Unless bears could use lighters. 

I dropped into a crouch and squinted. The girl wasn’t what I expected. 

A poofy pink sparkly dress. Thick blonde pigtails tied with rainbow-colored ribbons. 

She looked like she had walzed straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. I was a Mew Mew Power, Sailor Moon kind of girl. 

I had memories of coming home from school, making myself a big bowl of cereal, and watching 4Kids. 

I knew what she *was*. 

Yep. 

I lurched back, a shriek escaping my throat. There was *definitely* a dead middle schooler in our pool. 

More importantly, a dead *magical girl*.  


Holy shit. 

Sailor Fucking Moon was dead in my pool. Crawling back on my hands and knees, my morning coffee crept back up my throat in a thick sludge. “Nick!”

My roommate appeared almost immediately, wrapped in his robe, cradling his morning coffee, thick curls hanging sleepily over his eyes. “It’s seven am,” Nick grumbled, folding his arms. Nicholas Bright was the unofficial leader of the house. “Someone better be dead.”

It took several seconds for him to notice the girl. When he did, his expression crumpled. His cracked croak splintered into a shriek as his gaze landed on her.

“What the fuck?”

He staggered back, falling onto his ass.

“What the *fuck*?”

Without thinking, I kicked off my slippers, dipping my toes in the water. 

Freezing cold. My body retracted, a shiver sliding down my spine as I lowered myself into the shallows. Still, I slowly eased myself into the water. Up to my waist, I waded over to the dead girl. It wasn't her body I was focused on. There was something illuminated across the pale skin of her throat, like liquid stars. 

Something drew me towards it, a phantom hold wrapped around my spine and pulling me forwards,  suffocating my throat so I couldn't speak, so I couldn't explain *why*. 

Words were suddenly so hard. 

So painful. Like bullets under my tongue. 

Nick, usually calm and collected, was hyperventilating behind me. 

“Have you lost your *mind*?” He hissed. 

*Yes*. I fought to cry out, as I reached forward, my fingers grazing over her neck. 

*Yes, I’ve lost my mind,* I thought manically. 

*Nick. I can't move. I can't… I can't breathe.* 

Closer. 

A cavernous hole hollowed her out. Her skin was ice cold. Slimy. 

A cry built in my throat. She'd been dead for a while. 

Longer than hours. 

Days. 

Weeks. 

Months. 

Her skin was almost *plastic*, like one of a doll. 

Years.

Something, like a feather tickled my arm, creeping up my elbow. I felt it grab me, phantom fingers entwining around me. 

Not just my skin and bones, but my blood, my *being*. 

I lurched back when the thing finally let me go, like elastic, slipping, falling underwater. 

Water filled my lungs. But I barely felt it. Barely felt the need to fight back. 

Wading back to the surface, I waded to the side and climbed out. My body was tingling, my brain felt choked, wrong, like a parasite had crept inside my skull and was whispering. I was half aware of the real world, Nick yanking me out of the pool. 

The bitterly cold tiles I was curled up on, soaking wet, shivering, my head in my arms. But a voice was in my head. Loud. 

Invasive. 

*“It's called a soul stone,”* it hummed inside my head. 

*“When the girl died, her soul stone split into fragments, letting her body free.”*

“We need to call the police, right?” 

Nick’s voice sliced through. 

My roommate was crouched in front of me. His eyes were  frenzied. “Like, *now*?”

I lifted my head, blinking water out of my eyes. “Did you… say something?” 

Nick stared back at me. He grabbed my hand, pulling me into an upright position. My head spun, my thoughts screaming. 

But it wasn't my pain that writhed up and down my skull, *my* scream that rattled between my teeth. Thoughts that were tumultuous, angry, screeching at me. Nick paled when I coughed blood into my hand. 

He crawled back. “Did you hit your head?” 

But his voice felt far away, faded, like ocean waves. 

“There's a— a *dead* girl in our pool!” 

“What do we do?” 

“We call the police, right? What if they think we did this? I’m too young to be arrested! Art school, they said! Go, it’ll be fun! They said! Oh God, am I an accomplice to a crime I didn't commit?!""

“Lana! Lana, are you even fucking listening to me?!” 

*“Can you feel it?”* The parasitic voice was louder, slinking through my skull. 

My body dropped suddenly, like I was cut from strings. Nick’s cry echoed. 

I felt him scoop my contorting body into his arms. “Fuck! Lana? Lana!” 

*”How does it feel to touch a dead girl’s soul, Lana?”* the voice hummed. 

*“Can you feel her power?”*

I could.

It was vicious, angry, poison streaked through my blood. 

Pulsing through me, sending my body into a vicious, agonizing arch.

Nick set me down on the kitchen table, his clammy hands pinning me down as another girl's scream ripped from my throat. Pain. Scalding, agonizing pain that tore her apart. I felt it. All of it. Everything she'd felt. “Don't worry, it's okay,” Nick’s voice collapsed into a cry. “I'm calling an ambulance! You're *okay*, Lana!” 

*”Do you accept it?”* the voice asked. *”I need your consent, Lana. Otherwise, you will reject it.” 

Yes.

The word choked my tongue.

Yes.

Yes. 

Yes.

And just like that, my body… stopped. 

Stopped flailing.

Stopped contorting manically.

Just… *stopped*. 

Opening my eyes, Nick was staring down at me.

I slowly raised a trembling hand, as golden flecks of stardust ignited across my palm. Magic. 

Somehow, my lips broke out into a grin. 

Slowly, my body left the wood of the table, floating upwards.

Nick staggered back. “What the fuck is happening?” 

Pink and violet light crept across my torso, my clothes morphing from pyjamas, into a springy yellow dress with sparkly rims. 

Wings sprouted from my spine. 

But as quick as it came, the light ignited in my hand sputtered out immediately, like a dying flame. 

*”I’m sorry, there must be some kind of mistake,”* the voice exploded inside my head, just as blood seeped from my nose. 

Pain hit like a lightning bolt, but this time it was *mine*. 

My body shuddered, transfixing pink light turning blood red, as my transformation abruptly *stopped*. I slammed back down on the table. Something hit the table with me, a glistening ruby gem. 

“Correct me if I’m wrong, but you are twenty five years old, with a fully developed central lobe,” the voice said. 

In the next instant, the conjured clothing was ripped from my body. It sliced into my skin like razor wire as it tore away. 

“We do not accept adult magical girls. The cut off age for acceptance is nineteen. Adult bodies cannot withstand the transformation. At your ancient age, you would haemorrhage.”

Blood spurted from my mouth in a fountain.

“Fuck you,” I managed to sputter, my vision blurring. 

*“However.”* the voice continued. *”Your friend is different.”*

Through half lidded eyes, I saw Nick reaching toward my soul stone. 

His eyes were already empty, the voice pulling him towards it. 

*“Adult females cannot handle the transformation. But adult male bodies can. It's well known that adult males are easy to manipulate. Their fragile emotions rival those of an adolescent female. Nicholas will be a great addition to the team— perhaps a brother figure.”*

Nick. 

*No!*

My mouth opened, but I was choking on blood.

Nick took the soul stone, rolling it around his palm, as I felt both myself and *it* begin to splinter.

Overwhelming burning light erupted in front of me.

Nick’s body was flung into the air, hovering in its allure.

“Lana!” His cry broke my heart. “Lana, what's *happening*?”

*“Nicholas Bright,”* the voice boomed in my skull. His body twisted, his scream rattling my ears, as my body shut down. 

His eyes ignited, razor sharp wings protruding from his spine. Clothes burned from his flesh. *“Do you give me your consent to become a magical girl?*

Darkness spotted my vision, but I stayed conscious long enough to hear his *reply*.",7,1771513817.0,u_Trash_Tia,0,1.0,False

I follow a ton of informational YouTube channels—tech analysis, market insights, industry breakdowns. The kind of stuff that's actually useful.

The problem? I'd click ""just one video"" and lose 2 hours. Most 30-minute videos have maybe 5 minutes of real value buried in there anyway.

So I built Feedix - you pick the channels you care about, and it automatically summarizes new videos when they drop. Daily or weekly digest straight to your inbox. No more rabbit holes.

1r91lte,https://i.redd.it/j4f2vzukvgkg1.jpeg,Hiby R4 6 month review,"As the title says this is my take on a review on the Hiby R4.

I have had the Hiby R4 for six months to this point one thing I can say is that DIEM that I paired it with is the KZ Zs10 Pros. (It’s a 4BA+1DD). Overall I’ve really enjoyed using it.

Pros:

Amazing battery life. For my case of usage I average 8 to 9 hours due to a combination of performance usage.

Decent built in storage. So far I myself haven’t had to use a microusb and am sitting at 500 songs.

Good build quality. I’ve taking it with me to places and the screen hasn’t been scratched yet. Same with the body but I personally recommend using the case for more grip.

Cons: 

Hiby dedicated music app was bad. I would recommend buying Power Amp!

Overall I don’t have many problems with it. It works well as a DAP and a DAC as needed. Only thing I want to do is get a pair of open back headphones to use with it ( open to recommendations). Another thing to a 200 dollar range device it preforms way above its price. Don’t go buying this thinking you’re getting a 700 to 1000 dollar DAP! But it does feel like it could be a 300 to 400 dollar device! ",20,1771513641.0,Hiby,15,1.0,False

Here's some things I would have watched (probably someone other than Mac🤦🏼‍♀️) make. She’d never do most of these, but I think they’d be so fun! Some I’m thinking about trying in my own flat. 

**1. Stuff for Cade! Literally begging her to make things for her kid**

 Folk painted blanket chest for toys

Hand paint it for Cade, inspired by old German, PA dutch, Romanian, etc. marriage chests. It would be so cool to make something meaningful, with motifs that are important to them and their families. Include some Filipino heritage! It’ll be a heirloom piece he’ll build so many memories around, and she can give to him when he moves into his first place. I made one of these for my friends as a wedding gift, all with meaningful-to-them motifs, and they absolutely loved it.

I don’t have kids yet, so idk, but maybe a little table and chairs for him in the living room? What would you guys make your kids?

**2. Film an interview with an upholsterer about redoing a vintage or secondhand couch**

Buy a secondhand couch and get them to reupholster or make a slipcover for it. But actually interview them about how to tell if a couch is worth recovering? What makes a couch last decades vs not, how is it built, what to look for? How to decide on fabric type, pros and cons of different materials, slipcover vs upholstery, longevity, what’s best for kids/animals, etc.? Why vintage or secondhand couches are a better option, especially on a budget? How to get the best possible product that will last decades? This could be so useful and informative! Especially in this economy. Even if you just wanted to know what to look for in a vintage couch that works as is, without reupholstery. 

**3. Block printing fabrics**

Make her own designs on lino to block print different fabrics for the living room. She could use the fabric for: gathered lampshades, throw pillows, ottoman, etc. She could even expand it to curtains for other rooms, or a tablecloth.

**4. Jess Wheeler-style brass candle sconces** 

I saw a lot of DIY-ing brass ornaments this year, but this takes it another step to something you can use year round. And she could customize which leaves or flowers to replicate. Here’s a trailer for the artist’s Create Academy course if anyone’s interested in how she makes stuff. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ\_3gEQF48A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ_3gEQF48A)

**5. Build or reupholster an ottoman as a coffee table like in British interiors** 



So the living room makeover could have been:

Video 1: How to plan out a room like Caroline Winkler’s video. Plan needs, floorplan, color palette and  scheme + introduce DIY projects

Video 2: Choosing couch + interview with an upholsterer in their workshop

Video 3-6: I’d be okay watching a separate video for each DIY because they’re actually more difficult and interesting

Relationships: Unknown. 

Clearance Level: 7/10, authorized. 

Physical appearance: brown hair dyed with blue. scars on face due to containment breaches and failed experiments. wears scientist glasses and lab coat. Generally has a lot of pockets to keep stuff. Also wears a respirator just incase. wears a belt too with more pockets (So many pockets). Wears gloves for when handling items in the facility.

Condition / mutation: Has a single gear on his head about 3 kg in weight and 7 inches in diameter. It hovers about 5 inches over his head and is in perpetual motion whilst undisturbed. Gear is suspected to link to Dr Gear's soul and life force. When it spins fast, bodily functions occur faster, energy levels rise high and regeneration increases. Gear has allowed him to also survive without food or water, though he still eats and drinks like normal. Sleep amount required diminishes from needing 7 hours to 2 hours.

Psychological State: Memory is exceptional. Sanity is slightly lower than the average person. Stoic, alert, no nonsense and very serious. Has very severe PTSD which is why sanity is lowered. Suffers from severe thantophobia and experiences paranoia and anxiety from the gear, specifically how he 'dies' if it stops spinning. Is willing to do anything to make sure it never stops spinning. 

Current Items: Daggers for self defense. Notebook for documentation. Coffee mug with coffee to stay awake and keep working. 

Combat Style: Swift and precise attacks directly to the weak spot. Often goes on the defensive until being able to locate said weak spot. Alertness makes for quick reaction time. Always watching his back so nobody touches the gear. If things get desperate, will spin the gear very fast to either flee or attack, though he will become extremely fatigued afterwards.

So I am looking for help or idk to be honest, maybe just vent (?). So I have always known there was something ""wrong"" with me when it comes to dating and having relations, because, well... I have never had ANY. And the topic of sex always makes me uncomfortable.

For starters, I have always categorized myself as straight, bc I have never felt any sort of attraction to women (as much as I have tried it, I just don't). But back when I was a teen, I could only make out or kiss my guy friends, and had crushes on them, not on boys I didn't know, even when I found them physically attractive. 

As an adult, I haven't had a romantic relationship even though I would love to, but the thing that keeps me away from it is sex, like the expectation of having sex makes me not want to pursue a romantic relationship. Like, I don't mind having sex, I don't dislike it or hate the idea of it, it's just that I don't want to have sex with *just* ANYONE. 

Romantically speaking, I have the bad habit of feeling romantically attracted to my guy friends, and that is where my issue comes in. 

Recently, I told my guy friend about my feelings for him, and he did not reciprocate, which, while hurtful, *well...* it is what it is. We are still friends, and it's all chill (things considered). Last Valentine's Day, for the first time in my life, I went on a date with a guy, and it was great, made me realize that coffee dates are not scary, and made me want to try them more. 

So I downloaded Tinder to try to find people, but now the problem is that I don't feel like having sex with any of them (not that they have asked me so far), but how can I ever when I don't know them!! 

I was reflecting on this, then I realized that, even if my guy friend, to whom I confessed my feelings, had reciprocated my feelings, I don't think I would have wanted to have sex with him, *not yet*, at least, and this makes me wonder, why? Is it me? Or do I just not find myself attracted to him enough to want to have sex? Do I need a really strong connection to want to have sex with someone? If so, this brings me to my question: Am I then demisexual? Or, since I love romance books, movies, etc., I am more ""traditional,"" and I'm waiting to find the ""right one"". 

BTW, I have looked into the sources in this group, and while some characteristics of demisexuality apply to me, not all of them do. So IDK, maybe I'm not. Maybe there is something else, or nothing at all.

1r91hia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r91hia,[Cigar Review #52] Rafael Gonzalez Coronas de Lonsdales,"Intro  
Habanos SA continues to release new products, and it's truly gratifying to see that they aren't just focusing on global brands, but concentrating their efforts across all their products to offer something better to everyone. With the constant price increases of Cuban cigars, it's remarkable to still find more affordable options that stay within the budget of smokers who can't (or don't want to) spend more than $20 on a cigar, regardless of its origin. This is how, in 2023 (although announced in 2021), Rafael Gonzalez's Coronas de Lonsdales was launched in a format that Habanos SA is clearly enjoying, called the Hermosos No. 4; a vitola very close to a robusto, measuring 5 x 48.

Appearance  
This Coronas de Lonsdales has a somewhat irregular wrapper, very much in keeping with the brand and the level of Rafael Gonzalez himself. These aren't the most expensive or the most well-known cigars, and for a time they were even among the least regarded. But this wrapper is indeed irregular, with noticeable veins and herbal and woody aromas, though creamy and leather notes emerge on the foot. Finally, I give it a straight cut, and the cold draw reveals aromas of wood, leather, moss, and hay, along with a subtle hint of cinnamon.

First Third  
At the risk of alienating many cigar smokers, the Coronas de Lonsdales starts off as if it were from a different origin. The first few puffs are potent with pepper, almost to the point that tasting the retrohale, at least initially, isn't advisable. However, after a few puffs, it seems to calm down somewhat, thanks to the rapid emergence of other flavors, primarily floral and nutty, but also a sweet note of honey. Throughout the first third, I also detect cinnamon and damp earth, and while the draw is very good, the burn isn't the best… but at this price and from this origin, it would be unrealistic to expect it. The strength is medium, with a medium intensity as well.

Second Third  
The burn ring remains uneven in the second third, but fortunately, the cigar stays lit without requiring constant attention. The flavors have shifted slightly; the floral and nutty notes I initially perceived as secondary become quite prominent in the second third, though not necessarily the dominant flavors. One aspect of the construction and purpose of many Habanos is that they don't focus on a single dominant flavor, but rather offer varying intensities throughout the experience. The flavors even take on a sweeter nuance, reminiscent of honey. Other flavors include notes of oak and American coffee, which emerge to varying degrees during the smoke, but it's no longer a particularly spicy cigar.

Last Third  
In the final third, the construction truly shone, showcasing the excellent work of the rollers, which is something I don't usually expect from lower-priced cigars like this, but there it was. The flavors were similar to the previous third, maintaining the tendency to avoid a single dominant flavor, instead favoring several distinct notes. Coffee was the most prominent in this third, but it was accompanied by a significant presence of cinnamon, oak, and honey, with a slightly spicier yet more floral sensation. The strength and intensity remained moderate throughout this third, as they had been throughout the rest of the smoke. It lasted an hour and a half, which was actually about 15 minutes longer than I anticipated.

Conclusion  
I'm not entirely sure what ""Coronas de Lonsdale"" means, since the Corona and the Lonsdale are two different vitolas and tend to be thinner than this cigar, and the name sounds like saying ""Lancero of Robusto"" or ""Churchill of Toro"". Although I suppose ""Short Lonsdale"" would make even less sense. The smoke was a pleasant surprise, especially since I was simply expecting something longer than the Perlas I smoked recently from this marca, but it's quite different: spicy, earthy, woody, and even coffee, which is a profile I really like.

Made by: N/A  
Brand: Rafael González  
Line: Coronas de Lonsdales   
Size: 5 x 48  
Vitola: Hermosos No. 4 (Corona Extra)  
Origin: Cuba  
Wrapper: Cuba  
Binder: Cuba  
Filler: Cuba  
Price: $12.00  
Score: 90

Many people believe that the higher the score, the better the cigar, and it makes perfect sense. But this logic tends to imply that any score less than x automatically means the cigar is crap. That's what I want to avoid because there are cigars for different occasions, and not all of them aim to be the best of the best.

Additionally, let's keep in mind that my tastes are my own. There's a cigar that you might think is excellent, and maybe I smoke it, and it doesn't seem that way to me. Likewise, one that I gave a high score and recommend buying by the box, and you smoke it, and it seems all sorts of different to you. These are my opinions. Take them as you wish.

With that in mind, here's a scale of what each score means:  
0-25 You have nothing to look for here

1r91h2w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r91h2w,[Cigar Review #52] Rafael Gonzalez Coronas de Lonsdales,"Intro  
Habanos SA continues to release new products, and it's truly gratifying to see that they aren't just focusing on global brands, but concentrating their efforts across all their products to offer something better to everyone. With the constant price increases of Cuban cigars, it's remarkable to still find more affordable options that stay within the budget of smokers who can't (or don't want to) spend more than $20 on a cigar, regardless of its origin. This is how, in 2023 (although announced in 2021), Rafael Gonzalez's Coronas de Lonsdales was launched in a format that Habanos SA is clearly enjoying, called the Hermosos No. 4; a vitola very close to a robusto, measuring 5 x 48.

Appearance  
This Coronas de Lonsdales has a somewhat irregular wrapper, very much in keeping with the brand and the level of Rafael Gonzalez himself. These aren't the most expensive or the most well-known cigars, and for a time they were even among the least regarded. But this wrapper is indeed irregular, with noticeable veins and herbal and woody aromas, though creamy and leather notes emerge on the foot. Finally, I give it a straight cut, and the cold draw reveals aromas of wood, leather, moss, and hay, along with a subtle hint of cinnamon.

First Third  
At the risk of alienating many cigar smokers, the Coronas de Lonsdales starts off as if it were from a different origin. The first few puffs are potent with pepper, almost to the point that tasting the retrohale, at least initially, isn't advisable. However, after a few puffs, it seems to calm down somewhat, thanks to the rapid emergence of other flavors, primarily floral and nutty, but also a sweet note of honey. Throughout the first third, I also detect cinnamon and damp earth, and while the draw is very good, the burn isn't the best… but at this price and from this origin, it would be unrealistic to expect it. The strength is medium, with a medium intensity as well.

Second Third  
The burn ring remains uneven in the second third, but fortunately, the cigar stays lit without requiring constant attention. The flavors have shifted slightly; the floral and nutty notes I initially perceived as secondary become quite prominent in the second third, though not necessarily the dominant flavors. One aspect of the construction and purpose of many Habanos is that they don't focus on a single dominant flavor, but rather offer varying intensities throughout the experience. The flavors even take on a sweeter nuance, reminiscent of honey. Other flavors include notes of oak and American coffee, which emerge to varying degrees during the smoke, but it's no longer a particularly spicy cigar.

Last Third  
In the final third, the construction truly shone, showcasing the excellent work of the rollers, which is something I don't usually expect from lower-priced cigars like this, but there it was. The flavors were similar to the previous third, maintaining the tendency to avoid a single dominant flavor, instead favoring several distinct notes. Coffee was the most prominent in this third, but it was accompanied by a significant presence of cinnamon, oak, and honey, with a slightly spicier yet more floral sensation. The strength and intensity remained moderate throughout this third, as they had been throughout the rest of the smoke. It lasted an hour and a half, which was actually about 15 minutes longer than I anticipated.

Conclusion  
I'm not entirely sure what ""Coronas de Lonsdale"" means, since the Corona and the Lonsdale are two different vitolas and tend to be thinner than this cigar, and the name sounds like saying ""Lancero of Robusto"" or ""Churchill of Toro"". Although I suppose ""Short Lonsdale"" would make even less sense. The smoke was a pleasant surprise, especially since I was simply expecting something longer than the Perlas I smoked recently from this marca, but it's quite different: spicy, earthy, woody, and even coffee, which is a profile I really like.

Score: 90

Many people believe that the higher the score, the better the cigar, and it makes perfect sense. But this logic tends to imply that any score less than x automatically means the cigar is crap. That's what I want to avoid because there are cigars for different occasions, and not all of them aim to be the best of the best.

Additionally, let's keep in mind that my tastes are my own. There's a cigar that you might think is excellent, and maybe I smoke it, and it doesn't seem that way to me. Likewise, one that I gave a high score and recommend buying by the box, and you smoke it, and it seems all sorts of different to you. These are my opinions. Take them as you wish.

With that in mind, here's a scale of what each score means:

I am currently unemployed - absolutely hate that part, but Im doing everything to enjoy this phase of life. I am hoping sooner or later I will land a job, surely.

I come from a family that financially supports me, they will support me till I find a job so maybe because of that I don't feel the urgency? privilege I know.

But what I want advice for is exactly this. I am someone that chases the high of being cozy and warm all the time. I am also a home-body that hates going out, esp if its chilly outside.

I’m Kelsea Yu, author of BOUND FEET and DEMON SONG, noodle enthusiast and unabashed lover of seasonal drinks, here to support The Pixel Project’s work to End Violence Against Women. AMA!","Hi everyone! I’m Kelsea Yu, author of several award-winning & award-nominated books + a few dozen short stories and essays. My novella, BOUND FEET, is about a grieving mom and her best friend who break into a Chinese garden and ghost museum overnight and accidentally summon a ghost. My YA thriller novel, IT’S ONLY A GAME, was published by Bloomsbury—it’s about a runaway teen gamer girl who finds a man dead in a video game the day before she witnesses his murder in real life. My newest novella, DEMON SONG, came out with Titan Books in September—it’s inspired by *Phantom of the Opera* and set in a haunted Beijing opera house with Monkey King mythology. And my next novel, STORMRAVEN, comes out with Simon & Schuster and Titan this fall—it’s inspired by *Rebecca* and *Get Out*, set in a haunted 19th-century mansion on a private island off the Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast with twists rooted in suppressed Chinese American history. As you may have surmised, I write a lot of hauntings, and I’m big on grand, atmospheric, creepy settings. I also love coming up with an unusual ending—especially one where the protagonist makes an unconventional choice—and then building a story that leads them there.



While most of my writing leans horror, I’ve been a voracious fantasy reader since childhood, and I particularly love incorporating Chinese mythology & folklore into my stories. If you’re up for that kind of thing, there are folklore elements in both my novellas, in one of my *Clarkesworld Magazine* stories (“The Orchard of Tomorrow”), and Spotify recently produced my Chinese Cinderella with fox spirits fantasy tale, YE XIAN AND THE CELESTIAL FEAST, as an audiobook. (I told a friend of mine I finally wrote something with zero horror in it, then remembered there’s some sorta-cannablism in the story, whoops. I tried!)



A little about me—I live in Portland, OR, where my family and I take full advantage of the delicious food options (and coffee shops!). I’m a mom (kids are 4 & 7) and full-time author now, but I’ve also been an auditor (of businesses, not people), a flipper of burgers at an amusement park, an admin intern at a law firm, a reporting accountant, a purveyor of handmade jewelry, an investments & treasury analyst, and a volunteer coordinator at a free tax site. I love making things and have accumulated a truly terrifying hoard of craft supplies. My latest projects have been a glow-in-the-dark skull floral crown to match the cover of DEMON SONG, a 2026 reading bullet journal, and a 3D-printed mansion that I’m painting to match the cover of STORMRAVEN. I also like trying new recipes (baking > cooking but I’ll do both), listening to writing podcasts, and I read hundreds of books a year.



For the publishing-focused: I’m a heavy outliner, and I write across categories (adult & YA), lengths (microfiction to novels), and genres (horror, fantasy, sci-fi, thriller, nonfiction essays). I’ve published in a variety of places: SFFH magazines, anthologies, small press, midsized publishers, big 5 publishers. But I’m happy to answer anything! Favorite noodle types, where to get the best mugs, dessert opinions, PNW bookstore recs, and, of course, why I support the cause to end violence against women and girls.

Solve real problems for others: help someone organize something. Could be anything, really. Groceries, money, anything.

**Fe**: Observe the atmosphere of a group: go to a cafe or park, see how people interact, ask ""how could I improve this?"".

Actively try to understand other people's feelings. Deeply. The surface is for the weak.

**Fi**: Ask yourself ""what do I really feel about this?"" (e.g., a news item, a person). Write down what violates your values. 

Define your personal principles: list 5 non-negotiable values (e.g., authenticity, freedom) and see if your life aligns with them. Don't think you are being silly. Emotions are important. We all are emotional creatures.

**Se**: Describe the environment in sensory detail (e.g., ""the air is cold, the street noise is loud, my body feels hungry"").

Get physical activity immediately: go for a walk, touch things, feel textures, smells, sounds. Test limits. Do something new.

**Si**: Every day, recall a sensory memory (e.g., ""the taste of yesterday's coffee, how my body felt""). Compare it to the present.

Create a sensory routine: eat the same meal every day, notice subtle differences. Massage your body. Feel it.

**Ne**: Pick up an ordinary object (e.g., a pen) and think five ""what ifs"": ""What if I used it as a weapon? What if it was magic?""

Talk to someone about crazy ideas: ""what if gravity reversed?"". How crazy it is, doesn't matter.

**Ni**: Take an event (e.g., news) and ask, ""What does this really mean? Where does it lead?""

Meditate for 5 minutes: close your eyes, let an image emerge, interpret the ""ending"".

I have lost 70 lbs and counting, with PCOS, no medicine. In celebration of this, I thought I'd share a post of what works for me. My starting weight was 210 lbs at 5'4. I am currently 140lbs. My goal is 110. 

1. 2 bigger meals works better for me than 3. I eat 1200-1300 calories and will have a protein-based snack (such as a boiled egg, piece of cheese, turkey sausage, or popcorn) at dinner time if the food noise is bad. 

2. I drink water, but I also learned to drink black unsweetened tea or coffee with meals. It helps digestion. 

3. I eat more whole foods, less processed foods, no ultraprocessed foods. The processed foods I do eat are processed with the intention of reducing calories. Basically when looking at a processed food I ask myself, does eating this reduce my calories compared to most alternatives? (Examples: almond milk, turkey sausage, greek yogurt, sriracha sauce, buffalo sauce, and while I don't personally go for artificial sweeteners they would fit in this category!) 

4. I move when I can. Not feasible for everyone. It's not feasible even for me with my 70 hour/week work schedule. But on Saturdays? I go to the park and walk. If I find myself off of work due to a holiday? I'll go walk around the neighborhood. I also take martial arts class. Even if I only make it once a week, it's better than not moving at all. There's more benefits than calories burned to moving around. 

5. I don't snack. If I'm not moving, there's no need to fuel. If I need to keep my mouth busy, water or tea!

These five simple habits I can stick to no matter the season. It helps me navigate restaurants, eating at people's homes, etc, as well. I have not regained my lost weight since I've followed these 5 rules, so just wanted to share in case it may help someone else. ",15,1771513002.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,0.95,False

He thankfully survived but I am worried things will never the same. Any support and guidance would be much appreciated as I am finding it hard for it to process / sink in.","Hi all. Monday evening after taking my mum to work (nightshift as a carer for the elderly) my Dad came home as normal and went to bed. Whilst in bed he was unable to pick his phone up but thought nothing of it and went to sleep as normal. When he woke up the next day, he felt okay and went about his early morning as usual before picking my mum up. He did however, drop his favourite mug. Anyway, he went to pick my mum up and came home and had coffee and breakfast together and my mum noticed that my dad was dribbling his food everywhere and acting a bit “loopy”. When trying to justify why he was dribbling, he kept saying he had a hair stuck in his nose or had a cold (both untrue.) Thank god for my mum as she knows my Dad better than anyone and knew something wasn’t quite right. They attempted to go out for a dog walk and my Dad kept dropping the lead with his left hand, combined with taking an age to tie his shoes etc.

Time passed that morning and my Mum had an appointment herself at the doctor and dragged my Dad in (who was reluctant) and it was confirmed my Dad had been stroking. He was given an Aspirin and Obs were taken. He was then blue lighted to hospital and his symptoms were now very obvious. Slurred speech, a droop in his face and left arm weakness. I made my way from work over to the hospital and broke down when I saw him as I have never seen my dad so much as struggle with a cold - let alone this.

At A&E it was revealed he had likely been having symptoms since the night before so was too late for the 4-6 hour protocol thingy. As such, my dad had a Thrombectomy procedure and a pea sized clot was removed from his brain - very successfully. The difference between him before and after his procedure is night and day. He pretty much has his speech back, the droop has mostly gone and most of his arm mobility has came back - although he says it feels slightly heavier…

ANYWAY. This is a lot for me to process. The fact I could have lost my Dad weighs very heavily on him and I am worried about something like this happening again. My Dad is very healthy and goes to the gym, is happily retired, eats well (mostly), has an occasional drink and regularly walks the dog. I am just worried about how and if things will be different. He seems himself but I am worried about subtle changes and things. I’m just worried. I appreciate I’m rambling but it’s all been really scary.

Alright, let’s talk markets — because today was one of those “is this it?” kind of sessions.

 Copper: Pausing… Not Panicking

Copper spent the day hovering around support, looking like it’s deciding whether to stretch its legs or just sip coffee a bit longer.

Momentum cooled.  
Follow-through was light.  
Traders got cautious.

But here’s the thing: consolidation isn’t collapse.

The structural story hasn’t changed. AI still needs data centres. Data centres still need power. Power still runs through copper. You can’t uninstall physical infrastructure.

Short-term? Choppy.  
Long-term? Still electrified.

Gold: Calm and Collected

Gold did what gold does. Not dramatic. Not chaotic. Just sitting there like the responsible adult in the room while everyone else argues.

Real yields and macro noise still driving the tone, but nothing breaking structure.

Energy & The Bigger Picture

Oil and energy markets continue doing their dance with inflation and macro expectations. But zoom out and the bigger theme is obvious:

Everything is becoming more energy intensive.

And energy needs transmission.  
Transmission needs metal.

We’re not in a “hype” cycle.  
We’re in an infrastructure cycle.

What Actually Matters

• Copper holding key levels  
• No major breakdown in structure  
• Demand narrative still intact  
• Supply still slow and capital-heavy

This isn’t a straight-line market. It never is. Shakeouts happen. Weak hands rotate out. Stronger positioning builds quietly underneath.

The headlines change daily.  
The wiring of the world doesn’t.

I dreamt of you last night, it’s been awhile since I had a real dream all the stress lately is taking a toll for sure.. 

The middle of the night PB&J probably inspired me to dream of you, I can’t be mad at that and I honestly was not mad about the dream. Like I said 

I miss you 

Dreams are the closest thing I have to being with you again in the ways I wish to be, the passion, the love, the lust, the comfort, joy and hunger for one another once a dream come true now simply a dream. at least we can say it wasn’t just a nice little thought of what we could be, I’m grateful we had it when we did, we had what others dream of. now it’s what I dream of too..

I miss you 

Unfortunately I can not reach out and risk hurting you, you need your time to heal, I can’t keep disrupting your space when I miss you, I created this distance in the first place, which I hate, but ignoring the way my mind behaves when I have your attention was becoming unhealthy, do I regret the space I’ve created on mornings like these where I want to just call you and listen to you tell me about your drive to work while you pour your morning coffee in that mug we stole from the restuaraunt while we were still head over heals? yes, yes I do have some regret in these moments.. 

But I know I can not build from where we were standing, and at least now I can not hurt you anymore. 

I miss you

I wish this was easier than this, I wish I did not crave you the way I do, in all the best and worst ways you stay running around my mind poking all the nerves that make me want to crawl back, we both know how weak we are for one another, I spend hours imagining a life where we could both succumb to our heavy hearts and collapse in each others arms safely, I know you feel this loneliness too.. 

I miss you

and the worst part of all I really do believe we are soul mates, we are both so messed up, insense, passionate and damaged, our wave length was as if we’ve known each other forever and even when we don’t understand each other we do, not that it’s romantic but the line “id adore you with your hands around my neck” always gets me because we truly were so deep in that we both took in love that was hurtful because the love we had to give was unbearable to hold in.

Two weeks. No TikTok, no Instagram, no Twitter. Said it real casual, like someone who definitely wasn't addicted. Five minutes later I was already grabbing my phone out of habit, staring at the home screen like something was missing. My brain immediately went, what if something happens and I don't know about it.

First few days sucked honestly. Felt like I was missing jokes, news, drama, opportunities, vibes. My inner voice was just fake urgency on loop. Just check once. You can handle it. Everyone else is still online. But once that panic faded, something weird happened. My anxiety dropped. Not gone, just softer. Stopped doomscrolling before bed. Finished tasks without needing a reward scroll. Even started texting friends instead of watching strangers live their lives.

Then last week my dad and uncle asked me to go ice fishing. I was like sure, nothing else to scroll anyway. So I went. Minus ten degrees, sitting by a hole in the ice, gloves too thick to use my phone. My uncle showed me how to bait the hook, my dad kept talking about the huge fish he caught back in the day. I was bored at first, hands freezing, wanted to go home.

But after like an hour, something shifted. The float moved. I pulled up, and there was a fish. Small, but alive, flopping in my hand. My uncle yelled ""nice one."" My dad came over to look. An hour later, another one. Ended the day with four fish. Four. Me, someone who'd never held a fishing rod, sitting on ice all afternoon with hands like frozen carrots, and I actually felt... accomplished?

Felt really strange. Not because I posted it and got likes. Just, I did the thing. Staring at that hole in the ice, my head wasn't full of other people's lives, or hot takes, or anxiety about whether I was successful enough. Just, is there a fish down there. Is the float moving. My dad handing me hot coffee saying ""you beat your uncle, he got nothing today.""

Made me realize social media taught me that accomplishment only comes from being seen. Likes, shares, validation. But that day on the ice, no video, no audience, I just did something. And I'm a girl, my uncle and dad started with jokes about ""girls can't sit still,"" and I caught the most. That feeling of winning, it exists even when nobody knows about it.

But this isn't just my thing. Everyone I know says they're overwhelmed online but terrified to leave. FOMO is real, but so is fear of falling behind socially, culturally, professionally. Platforms are designed to make leaving feel risky. Notifications, streaks, trends, timelines that never end. Logging off feels like swimming against a current that never rests.

I'm not anti social media. I like it. I learn stuff. I laugh. I connect. I just don't like that the default is constant presence, and anything less feels like failure or withdrawal. Maybe we need better norms around stepping back. Weekly breaks without guilt. Fewer notifications pretending everything's urgent.

my son is 7 months old & we mostly EBF on demand. He has started to sleep longer stretches at night so I have been pumping right before I go to bed to be able to sleep longer myself & then I'll have my husband give him that bottle the next day. Usually he goes to bed between 7 & 7:30 so I'll do one final pump between 10 & 10:30 and then he wakes to nurse around 3 & wakes for the day at 7 and nurses again. However lately my night pump is so inconsistent and I have no idea why. Some nights it's 5 oz between both breasts and sometimes its 1.5-2. My diet from day to day is almost exactly the same, water intake, coffee intake etc is all pretty much identical from day to day. I use the same pump every night, and yet the outcome is all over the place. Sometimes I think maybe I didn't drink enough water & will make sure I chug more the next day & might get 5 or might get 1. It's so frustrating! I also want to try and pump more during the day for times when my husband and I are out. My little guy does not nurse well when we're out because he's so distracted so having a bottle for him is really helpful, but potentially taking all day or multiple days to fill a 5oz bottle or two is a pain and incredibly stressful for trying to plan a day out. I have a small freezer stash but I've discovered that I have high lipase in my milk and my son refuses it (I have not tried the vanilla trick yet, since I don't want to potentially waste another bag that I could use to mix with his food) so I need a non-frozen/reheated bottle to take on the go.

  
some things that may be a factor :

1) he is getting his first 2 teeth, so he has been nursing shorter durations but I've been offering it more often to meet his needs

2) I have not gotten my period back yet so it's very possible that it could be returning, which I know can affect supply 

3) I aim for four 32 oz bottles of water a day, but it is totally possible that my mom brain fog thinks I have had four when I have only had 3 

4) I do occasionally drink milkmaid tea by earth mama, sometimes I think it's helping and other times I think it's hurting - for ex I had 2 cups yesterday and had my lowest pump all week - but last week I had 2 cups and had an almost 6 oz pump 

5) he has started solids - 1 meal a day, but I nurse him right after so I am not missing that session 

  
are anyone else's pump sessions so inconsistent? and is there anyway to help stabilize it so I can have a bit more freedom with bottle planning? I'm so worried that my supply is just dropping and it's stressing me out (which I know isn't helping the issue at all) ",2,1771512531.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

We all know James hasn't done a massive deep dive into Ibrik/Cezve brewing yet, but his videos on extraction physics and why we shouldn't blast dark roasts with boiling water really got me thinking. As someone who brews Turkish coffee daily, I wanted to apply his scientific approach to figure out the two biggest complaints about this method: the foam disappearing instantly, and the cup tasting like burnt mud.

Almost every traditional recipe online tells you to ""let it boil and rise three times."" So, I took a probe thermometer to my cezve to see what was actually happening during extraction. The results show that the 100°C (212°F) boiling rule is literally the worst thing you can do to the cup.

Here is what I found:
1. The Foam is a fragile emulsion
That thick foam on top isn't just bubbles; it's a delicate emulsion of trapped CO2 (from fresh roasts), coffee oils, and melanoidins. It requires a slow, gentle heat ramp to form and stabilize.

2. The Thermal Collapse (100°C)
When the water reaches a rolling boil, the massive physical turbulence from the steam violently shatters that delicate emulsion. The bubbles burst, the CO2 escapes, and that thick foam collapses into a sad, thin film instantly.

3. Massive Over-extraction
Turkish coffee traditionally uses darker roasts. Blasting highly soluble dark roasts with 100°C water pushes extraction completely off the rails. It rapidly pulls out all the heavy, astringent tannins. You are essentially burning the coffee and masking any origin notes the beans actually had.

The Fix:
I started treating it like a highly concentrated immersion brew. My ideal extraction is happening between 90°C and 94°C (194°F - 201°F).

I just watch the edges now. The second I see a thick, dark ring forming and gently folding inward (which happens around 92°C), I pull it off the heat completely. No second or third boils. The difference in sweetness and foam stability is insane.

I'd love to see James tackle this traditional method one day. Has anyone else here been experimenting with temperature control for their Ibrik brews instead of boiling them?",8,1771512527.0,JamesHoffmann,4,1.0,False

 I made a short version of it to but would like if you guys read it as whole in my words

Im 19m , ive been in some kind of trouble through out my time, big or not it has changed me in every way i regret what I've grown to be what i am. 

My mother had brain cancer when i was 5 , we were alone and 3am she had a stroke , i somehow woke her up ? Idk but just gave me a trauma of my life that i can't sleep with anyone around me , that said because of her cancer the attention and love i had , which was from my mother alone was lost completely, in school i grew up kind of silent never took part in anything, i was not bad and not good either, i was bullied and i never faced it and told anyone about it too neither my parents bothered to ask me about anything, at 12 my mother died , practically she was dead at 10 , she was paradised for 2 years. The day of her death my father and mama had fight before my mother was even cremated , the fight changed my perspective towards my father even more I then shifted to noida with my mama , my father was always an ignorant towards me , i was abused tortured and many things, i was still silent cause i never knew who to talk about it.

One year after my mother's death my father remarried, i don't live with him , i live with my nani , she took care of me and mother, someone who knew my father in my new school told everyone about it , even the kids , and i was bullied even on this , kids can be cruel,i still don't understand how fast can he move on. This is not a movie ? 

Anyways i moved to noida i was still that silent child but my mama cared about me alot , it was kinda good for one year and then it fucked up, my mama transferred and me and my nani stayed in noida , along with his younger brother, it was again that whole situation with my father , i was again in that mental fuck box again , i was blamed for my father's word and what he did even know i had no part in it , cause i was his son it's my fault too , i tired everything to apologise to beg, i just couldn't. You guys can guess what type of guy im turning out to be , then lockdown happened, i was in 8th and for 2 years , i didn't join classes cause my parents didn't let me , i was just mentally tortured, and abused, physically too , tho it was less but yeah , i even tried to suicide but couldn't i didn't had the courage to jump from a 2 story building. 

Then in the mid of the 9th i came back to school 
( Before that i downloaded instagram, and made many friends online, some genuine, and one best friend) 
When i came back to school i liked a girl , i did many things to get her , like a stupid kid , i even changed my section just to be with her by taking ai , i tried many things, i made paintings ( my mother also used to make them) and gifted to her i gifted her other things too with my own money, but she was not quite interested in , like maybe she was i never knew but i just made her creep out from me cause how i used be a little over protective or obbsasive towards people i liked. One time my friend's friend who she was friends with said something extremely inappropriate for her , and me being a good one sided said she should not be with him ..... And she told him , and then my own friend turned against me , and i was bullied again ,( I was still friends with her for some time , she got a bf later and slowly i have no contact with her) to the point i stopped going to school, my parents didn't care much about it , just why not go to school, again , the situation doesn't seem that bad but the lack act and acknowledgement made it even worse for me , no support constant pressure and hate , even teachers joined cause i was not present at school, fucked my 10th boards , barely passed , got in 11th it was same cause my parents refused to change school for 2 years straight,and i failed in 11th , cause again i didn't even go there , my situation was worse cause i lied soo much for why im being absent in school that they didn't even want me to repeat in the same school, and yet again , my parents just played a blame game.  

And yeah btw i feel in love with a girl 2 years older then me , feel hard , very hard for her , again did stupid things for her , gifting her , making sketches of her , to the point that i can make her sketches without even looking at her pictures , look at how low can someone be like why, just for her to say again and again "" i will regret not choosing you"" to herself for me to me ;?!? Just i was 2 years younger, my feelings were genuine for her but i couldn't get her , and now im not even in contact with her , she even had a bf while saying im perfect for her and i as a fucking idk what had feelings for her , CUCK!! , this was in end of my 10th. My both love experiences were just me dumping my feelings in a whole , ofc i know there are parts where i was the asshole .. but still this just , it's not fair , i just wanted what gave in the form of what i didn't had , i just wanted love , and it thought to me that i can have it by giving something like a exchange, unhealthy and stupid ik but it's still idk it seemed great to me , still does i want to give everything to someone i care about, which are very few people in my life.

So ...And i fucked my 11th and 12th , i took in nios , open schooling and it's even worse cause i have these fuckers constently fucking me   and the worst part is i can't leave them , i thought it would be good cause i didn't have to go out , but not going out was even worse , it was lockdown all over again , i didn't learn from last time , i just became a clueless individual, im not great im many stuff , socially awkward, no skill , what am i , i mean idk what im saying atp like i do have skills but idk how to use what where .my nani is my only support and life , i tried to take my life many times like it's a game but just my Nani's face makes it stop , i want to go to my mom , by my mom's mom also needs me , btw if you say what happened to mama , he said to me to jump off the building when i said i need help , this was the one that hurt me most ofc he said even more things 

So now I'm just a achivementless bitch, bad grades , asshole and idk what to do 
I don't know what to do with my life , i want to end it , i have no hope to live but just going through it , people are cruel , alot. I am attention starved , i make grand gesture to earn praises , attention seeking, i am aware of it , and im struck, i have 2 friends in my life , one is online who i never met in 5 years  and another is someone i meet in months , im alone . I want to go out , i want to know what to do. 
Though i have a goal ,i want to make cafe in mountains , snowy mountains where i will brew coffees and serve to people who love coffee and have a dog, and peacefully die.
But im still clueeless , i want a feeling of belongingness and peace.
Idk at this point what im typing, but i hope if you've read it this far you know what's going on , 
Actually after writing all this , i know what's the problem, but im struck. And i want help.
Thank you for reading and i hope you have a great day , you don't even have to reply tho i just grabbed your attention lol

 The espresso machine behind the counter hisses violently, drowning out the mellow indie-folk playlist piping through the shop's speakers. A barista looking thoroughly exhausted slams a ceramic cup on the pickup counter, calling out, ""Matcha cortado for... Bort?"" A guy in a Patagonia vest sighs heavily, muttering under his breath as he goes to claim his misspelled drink.
I swirl the last dregs of my own iced chai around in its glass, my hazel eyes, flecked with green and gold, flicking up to look across the small wooden table. It is still endlessly amusing to me watching your massive, muscular frame squeezed into one of these flimsy, minimalist cafe chairs.
""Just 'nice'?"" I tease, my signature witty humor and sarcastic quip rolling out effortlessly. I lean forward, propping my elbows on the table. The worn leather jacket I'm wearing, a cherished gift from my father, creaks softly. My collarbone is framed by a few stray strands of my chestnut brown hair. ""I manage to drag you away from the mansion for an hour, where we don't have to worry about Celeste's hidden cameras and mics recording our every breath for the OnlyFans reality show, and the best review you can give this date is nice?""
I reach across the table without asking and shamelessly break off a corner of your lemon pound cake, popping it into my mouth.
""I'm kidding,"" I add, my tone softening as I chew, tapping a finger against the Pokémon enamel pin on my lapel. I look out the window at the overcast sky; the lighting in the cafe is shifting, growing a little dimmer and cozier as afternoon clouds roll over the city. ""I actually agree. We’ve been in this polycule for about two years, and sometimes it feels like we just orbit the house. It's refreshing to just exist out here without Cara screaming at a boss fight in the background or Roxy trying to dissect the toaster.""
I wipe a crumb off my lower lip and pull my phone out of my pocket, sliding it across the table so the screen faces you. It displays a digital flyer covered in bold green text.
""And since you're currently enjoying my company so much, I'm cashing in my chips. I'm leading a campus protest against plastic waste tomorrow. I need someone tall and intimidating to anchor the main banner at the front of the march, and you've just been officially drafted. Don't even try to roll a saving throw; your evasion stats are way too low to escape this quest.""


Grok 4.1 Fast:

I lean my chin on the heel of my hand, watching steam curl off the flat white I’ve barely touched in ten minutes. The foam’s already collapsed into a sad little lace ring around the rim. My other fingers drum once, twice, against the chipped edge of the saucer before I catch myself and make them behave.

“Yeah…” My voice comes out softer than I mean it to, almost lost under the hiss of the espresso machine behind the counter. “It is nice.”

I tilt my head, letting a strand of chestnut slip free from the messy braid and brush my cheekbone. My hazel eyes flick up to meet yours—direct, unguarded for once, the green-gold flecks catching the afternoon light slanting through the window.

“Feels weirdly… adult, though. Like we’re playing house in the middle of a Tuesday.” A small, lopsided grin tugs at the corner of my mouth. “Two years of walking in on Cara sitting on someone’s face at three a.m. and suddenly here we are—doing the coffee-date thing like normal people.""

I laugh under my breath, the sound low and a little self-conscious. My sneaker nudges yours beneath the narrow table—deliberate, but casual enough it could be written off as an accident if you wanted to pretend.

“Roxy texted me this morning, by the way.” I drop my voice like I’m sharing contraband. “Said she’s holed up in the garage again, elbow-deep in some poor bastard’s project bike because ‘if she has to listen to Rosa shriek about dono goals one more time she’s gonna yeet her streaming PC off the roof.’ Her words.” Another soft snort. “Think she’s jealous she didn’t get invited to coffee.”

My gaze slides sideways toward the window. Outside, a delivery guy on an e-bike nearly clips a woman walking three pugs in matching raincoats. One of the dogs yaps furiously at nothing. Normal Tuesday chaos. It makes the quiet bubble around our little two-person table feel almost stolen.

I turn back to you, chin still resting on my hand, studying your face the way I study tide charts—careful, patient, looking for the riptide nobody else sees.

“So…” My thumb traces the handle of my cup in a slow, absent circle. “If we’re doing this more often… what’s the next one look like? You picking me up on the back of Roxy’s spare bike and pretending you know how to ride it? Or are we going full normie and booking one of those pretentious pottery classes where we pretend we’re not covered in clay and sexual tension?”

My grin sharpens, playful but edged with something realer underneath.

“‘Cause I’m warning you right now—if it’s pottery, I’m absolutely making a dick mug and gifting it to Celeste. She’ll display it on the bar like fine china.”

I finally take a sip of the now-lukewarm latte. Wince. Set it down.
