1kgeczr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1kgeczr/today_is_my_30th_birthday_and_my_dad_surprise_me/,Today is my 30th birthday and my dad surprise me with a gift that I didn‚Äôt know about.,"I was raised in China in the poor district of Guangdong Province. My parents were worked on the village plot where we made a living off, selling sugarcane, vegetables, and potatoes. we had a cow named Horton who helped on the field, making the farming work much easier, but life was still very difficult. 

I didn‚Äôt have much growing up . My parents gave me the necessities and made sure that I had everything that I needed to succeed in school. I made my parents really proud in my elementary years as I placed third in my class, counting backwards. They taught that no matter what, hard work and perseverance will get me the furthest. My parents always boast about their 12 mile walk to school when they were just in the second grade and on certain days my dad even had to swim 3 miles to and from school. I took these lessons to heart and made sure that I too would be able to walk and swim when I grow up.

Fast-forward 22 years, I am now an agricultural engineer. I make a modest 75k a year. Each year on my birthday, my mom would get me a sack of tangerines and a red envelope. It wasn‚Äôt much, but I really appreciated their gift every year. 

This birthday however was special. My mom bought me a Jasmine flavored cake. The ones with the fresh fruits and all, which I never had because it had always been a sponge cake with no filling. With it, she strangely told me to pay off all my credit card debt, which I did. The next morning, after a nice dream and a sip of coffee, my parents pulled me aside to share with me some news that I hadn‚Äôt expected or ever heard of in my life. She wrote me a cheque for 12.5M USD. I thought they had robbed the bank. I was shocked to learn that they had sold the farm that they once worked on in the village. It all started to make sense why J.P.Morgan and Merrill Lynch kept sending investment letters to my home like Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. I started to piece together how they were able to have abalone with a side of bird‚Äôs nest soup every few weeks. 

Honestly, this is not gonna change me other than the fact that I will buy a Patek turbuilllon, a small boat of the Ferrari brand, and a modest Mercedes G-63 Brabus with the custom Ardoire Togo leather interior. I might even retire 15 years early and tell my boss that O hated him since our second Zoom meeting and even more so after our first performance review. But honestly, I‚Äôm not gonna change much. 

TLDR: my parents were rich and acted poor. Now I‚Äôm rich and I might act a little rich, but I won‚Äôt change. ",2,1746562177.0,Salary,1,0.75,False

1kge9xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kge9xj/someone_please_convince_me_not_to_buy_bitcoin/,Someone please convince me not to buy bitcoin,"I have been profitable in long term investing using fundamentals (beating the S&P). That means I've hated bitcoin for a very long time. Recently, I've come across a few things that made me change my mind about bitcoin. The new things I learned addressed what I thought were bitcoin's weaknesses. I'd appreciate if the experts here to poke holes and point out things I havent thought about. Here are the things I've learned, without listing the stuff that most people already know. I'm hoping someone who supports and understands bitcoin very well can throw a wrench in here.

- The purpose of bitcoin has changed. It will no longer be intended to buy coffees. It could replace settlement system between the different reserve systems and their banks. This makes sense when I think about how it can take weeks for a transaction to settle when sending (and/or converting) fiat money to another country, because there are many intermediaries and there is risk between every intermediary. This means large, and fewer transactions onto the blockchain, with the lightning network filling in the role between a retail bank and its customers.

- Power consumption - Mining operations are using only excess capacity electricity. That means new energy projects can be supported by miners until the energy producer has enough non-mining customers to drive up the energy cost. Mining operations are only using electricity that would otherwise be wasted or dissipated. 

- No government will ever create a digitial coin that can be trusted by people, because the the entire purpose of fiat is for the government to be the sole owner of the money printer. If a government were to clone bitcoin and then officially sanction it as their hard currency, I could kind of see how that official support might create a real competitor, but I am not convinced a government would ever do this, and I am not sure how the government can convince people to adopt it over bitcoin.

- No other digital coin is likely to replace bitcoin because no other new coin can have 2 decades of proof of work to wield as authority.",4,1746561974.0,Bitcoin,11,1.0,False

I‚Äôm keeping service/atmosphere in consideration but it‚Äôs heavily weighted towards the food. Obviously it‚Äôs all just personal opinion based on one meal too!

While everything listed is in ranked order, the only place I wouldn‚Äôt recommend is Tompkins honestly. Everything else was good enough that I‚Äôd revisit, the top 5 or so I would go well out of my way for.

1. Anixi - Khachapuri, Chicken Gyro Rolls, Kofta, Manti Lamb Pockets. This was incredible, must visit. The yolk in the Khachapuri was almost too accurate. Had the leftovers for breakfast

2. Seed & Mill - Soft serve with Halva. On a hot day at the end of the High Line this was a perfect dessert, I think about it constantly, lovely guy working there too.

3. Spicy Moon - General Tso‚Äôs chicken, DanDan noodles w/beef, crab rangoons, wontons in chili. This is up there with Tofu Vegan in London for me which is high praise, I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the mains, drinks and vibes were great too. Crab Rangoons and the service let it down but everything else was immaculate. 

4. Confectionary! - Macarons, assorted cookies, Tarts. Had to show restraint here, everything was so tasty. The pistachio and the peanut butter cookies as well as the blueberry lemon tart were standouts for me but I loved it all. This place is a do not miss

5. Orchard Grocer - Marlowe. Great sandwich, stacked with pastrami, quite messy. Loved that it was a full vegan spot, bonus points for the shop next door with a very friendly cat. It was a bit out of the way for us or I‚Äôd have gone more times. Vanilla and Choc soft serve but unfortunately the machine was off when we went.

6. Plantega - SEC, Cubano, Chicken Sub. Went to Plantega a few times and this is where they averaged out. Loved it for the ease and the fact it gives vegan visitors the option of a proper Bodega sandwich.

7. Vegan on the Fly - Chopped Cheese, Jerk Chicken Mac and Cheese. Proper comfort food, the mac and cheese was very wet, the chopped cheese was huge and pretty greasy. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend sitting in but would definitely go again. Soft serve looked great didn‚Äôt get the chance to try it.

8. Franchia - Steamed Dumplings, Lions Mane Bites, Singapore Curry Noodles, Braised Tofu. This was tasty, loved the lions mane and the braised tofu. Overall it was nothing to write home about

9. Beyond sushi - Crab Rangoons, Ozisushi Spicy Salmon Rolls, Spicy crab , Charred Sprouts, Matcha Strawberry Tart. The service here was really good, definitely outshone the food. The ‚Äúspicy‚Äù rolls were pretty bland, I had to send a cocktail back it was so bad. Delicious rangoons, better than SM‚Äôs, nice pudding. 

10. Jajaja - Tacos and Birria loaded nachos and Churritos. Nice lunch, great service, really good cocktails. I would go here again but it was nothing amazing, the dip that came with the churritos was lovely

11. Vinnie‚Äôs Pizza - Vodka Sauce & BBQ chicken slices. Hard to rank as we didn‚Äôt have any other pizza, it was good, felt very ‚Äúauthentic NYC‚Äù from a tourist perspective. I‚Äôd recommend it but also wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way for it. 

12. Pick a bagel - Tofu CC / Everyting bagel, Tofu Scallion and tomato / Onion bagel. Very generous with their CC, really nice bagels, good price

13. John‚Äôs - Eggplant Parmiagana, Seitan Scallopini, Tiramisu. Absolutely loved the atmosphere in here, I‚Äôd recommend going just for the experience, and I would go back if I visit again. But the food was like a nice home cooked meal and the tiramisu was bad

14. Urban Vegan Kitchen - Coconut Shrimp, Chicken and Waffles. Honestly think it was my own fault ordering this main, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it but it was well cooked and the staff were really nice. The shrimp was delicious however. Would like to try again and pick other stuff from the menu

15. Tompkins square bagels - Why is it so hyped? Bagels weren‚Äôt very good, and they were tight with the fillings. Lots of options though

Best coffees for anyone interested were at Black Fox, La Cabra and Devocion. Notable mention to Ground Central Coffee Company, they had a decent vegan bakery selection and the tahini choc chip cookie was great.

There were a few places we wanted to go to but didn‚Äôt get a chance. However we‚Äôll definitely be back to try more. Thanks for all the tips I picked up in previous posts ",2,1746561561.0,nycvegan,0,1.0,False

You confuse me and I don't know what you want. What's your MO? I hate that I wonder about angles and ulterior motives. I've become quite fond of trusting no one.

1kge0qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1kge0qi/my_experience_dental_phobia_and_ocd/,My Experience - Dental Phobia and OCD,"Hi everyone! I had my wisdom teeth out last week and I thought I would share my experience, especially for people coming to this sub with fear of the procesure. This account of my experience is mostly meant for people with similar issues as I have. As said in the title, I have a dental phobia and OCD that is typically focused on medical procedures and thoughts of harm.  Going in, I knew these would be big challenges for me but I'm at a week of recovery and I am so glad that I faced my fears. It's hard, but you can do it too!

The day before my procedure I had a large lunch, a large dinner, some ice cream, and LOTS of water. Make sure to hydrate, I think that helped a lot on day 1. I began my fast at midnight to prepare for the surgery at 8. I had scheduled the procedure about 10 weeks out so that I could get an early time slot, and I would recommend doing so to make the fast easier.

I was really nervous about receiving IV sedation and it was definitely scary. I think the worst part was the lead up to getting into the chair, and starting the whole process. Once they placed the IV, I was under in about 15 seconds. The whole thing was a half hour tops. We left the house at 7:30, and I was back home on the couch before 9. Plus, they took me back late at about 8:10 due to one of the techs being late. So very very quick!

As for my actual teeth - I had all 4 wisdom teeth fully in; they were twisted around but not impacted. The two on my right side erupted in 2020, and the two on my left erupted in 2024. This was a long time coming! They gave me stitches on the bottom because apparently those are more likely to develop dry socket. The top two did not get stitches at all.

My first day of recovery, I was very groggy, but not in a bad mood. I was not in much pain, and I was pretty much continually icing. I had two ice pack straps, and as soon as one would be too warm I would put the next one on. That first night was the peak of my swelling. I didn't eat anything solid, but I had lots of fluids, a smoothie, and a protein shake.

The next day, I began the warm compresses and those brought the swelling down quickly. I also began trying to introduce foods, I ate a pudding and a few bites of baked potato. It was really helpful to start stretching my jaw. I was definitely still stiff, but the pain was starting to subside. I took Tylenol (I found a powdered form that was really easy to take, would recommend) every 4-6 hours. I wasn't super disciplined with it because I didn't need to be. Pain levels were honestly very tolerable.

Day 3 I left my house to get coffee and do an errand, but it was very taxing. I immediately came home and napped for an hour and a half. Be prepared to be TIRED. Keep moving, but be gentle on yourself and let yourself rest. I also had some mac n cheese by day 3, mostly swallowing it whole or chewing just in the front.

Then was the sinus period. Oh boy, that was rough. For about 3 days, I had nasty sinus headaches, a double earache, postnasal drip, sore throat, acid reflux, the whole 9 yards. I took antibiotics so I'm not sure if it was an infection or a normal reaponse. I did call my surgeon at one point and he told me that some sinus discomfort was normal. I took some cough medicine on top of the Tylenol and that helped some. Those were the only days that I had symptoms that I felt were difficult to manage and that I felt uncomfortable. To anyone else who had the same, I sympathize.

Now, I'm mostly dealing with a reduced appetite. I'm pretty sick of baked potatoes and mac n cheese, but I'm not yet confident enough to graduate to more solid foods. I'm still chewing in the front for the most part, since the back of my mouth still feels a bit gummy and odd. Tomorrow I may try to eat some pancakes. But honestly, other than the sinus complications, it's all been very smooth and easy. I haven't had any pain meds all day and I don't really mind.

Here are some things that I was really worried about, that you may be too:

DRY SOCKET: Follow all instructions from your dentist, and it should be okay. I am still avoiding straws and too much strain to the mouth, just in case, but I don't feel put out by it. Some pain is normal so don't psych yourself out thinking you have a dry socket when it's normal. Double up pain meds if you have to.

BLOOD TASTE: This was a struggle I did some exposures about before having the procedure. The taste of blood could be enough to trigger a panic attack for me, so I was very apprehensive of the removal. For an exposure, I would create a blood taste in my mouth once every few days (flossing vigorously did the trick) and I would sit with the discomfort until I began to feel more comfortable with it. When I was actually in the recovery stage, a few sips of Gatorade would wash away the taste and I wouldn't panic.

SLEEPING: I got a block pillow for recovery and I had a great time with it. I can still sleep mostly on my side, but make sure everything is elevated to promote healing. I found one online for 20 bucks, and it was a great investment. I'm still using it to just lounge in bed and read!

MEALTIME: Obviously choose foods that you're comfortable with, but I feel like protein shakes, smoothies and pudding were the best things for me the first few days. Then baked potatoes and mac n cheese were the best. Now I'm eating salmon with refried beans and a little rice. I'm craving a burger, but I'll get there eventually...

Anyways, I hope this can be helpful to someone going into surgery or starting their recovery process. It was scary, but I did it scared and I'm happy I did. I also had some support from a therapist who provides ERP therapy, which is a whole separate journey I'm on. If you really struggle with fears, it's something you should look into because it's helped me a lot and I could not have done this surgery without my ERP techniques.  If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer in the comments!",1,1746561371.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 49, black, single and living in SoCal. Fortunately, there is no shortage of the type of white woman I‚Äôm enamored with, but this type of woman doesn‚Äôt typically date interracially, so it remains an unfilled fantasy. 

My dream woman is between 38 and 50, fit (but not a gym rat) and is usually wearing workout clothes from Alo or Lululemon. She likely has her hair in a ponytail or her pixie haircut is hiding under a well-worn ball cap that frames her face. She wears little to no makeup, but has a skin regiment that keeps her looking vibrant and youthful. She usually has one of those large Stanley tumblers in one hand and her phone in the other. She always has a look of urgency, even when she‚Äôs getting coffee or shopping. She smiles, but usually it‚Äôs a transactional reflex more than an intentional act. She displays muted signs of wealth like a simple David Yurman bracelet or an Oura ring. 

She avoids eye contact, mostly because she‚Äôs deep in her head about a series of tasks she never has time to complete. All of her basic needs are met, but she‚Äôs always retrospective about being good enough. 

I‚Äôve tried to approach these women and even made it as far as a number exchange, but most of them have lives that I just wouldn‚Äôt fit in. Even if there is an attraction, how does she explain this drastic departure from the social norms she‚Äôs been curating since college? 

If I‚Äôm honest, I‚Äôm not trying to disrupt her perfect, suburban life with my presence. I love that she‚Äôs isolated herself in socio-economic and cultural spaces that limit her worldview. It‚Äôs her unfettered optimism that makes her so sexy. 

No, I‚Äôd love to be her escape. A moment in time on her well-organized, color-coded Outlook calendar that marks the date and time of our salacious rendezvous. For a few hours a week, she gets to leave her life and her lists behind. She gets to be the recipient of pleasure, not the sole creator of everyone else‚Äôs comfort. She gets to allow herself to dive deep into carnal fantasies without damaging the world she‚Äôs created. Just the thought of the juxtaposition of my hand touching her pale, expensively moisturized skin excites me. 

Then, when it‚Äôs over, she goes back to her busy life, juggling all the things and people she‚Äôs responsible for. But occasionally, she allows her mind to wander and reminisce as she stares off into space, gently tugging her Van Cleef necklace and biting her lip. 

At this point, I‚Äôm losing hope that my fantasy will ever come to fruition. For now, I‚Äôm grateful to Starbucks, outside shopping centers, expensive grocery stores, and farmer‚Äôs markets for being the preferred destination of my dream woman. 

As a successful, attractive man in LA, I don‚Äôt really struggle with dating, but this specific archetype seems consistently out of my reach. If I‚Äôm ever lucky enough to convince one of these ladies to venture outside of their comfort zones for a bit, I‚Äôll be eternally grateful. ",0,1746561233.0,confessions,0,0.33,False

**April 10-April 30** \- My symptoms changed to BV like symptoms (burning and itching inside the whole vulva, burning when I peed, and a strange fishy/metallic smell). I was given Metronidazole for 7 days. There was slight improvement.

The part in question shows marking of ""NTC xxxD-9""  
Based on the datasheet I've found and the remaining marking (see pictures), it seems as it could be:

NTC 5D-9: 5ohm@25degC, 3A steady current  
NTC 6D-9: 6ohm@25degC, 2A steady current

Proteinuria.  Wondering if I need a quicker follow up.  Also Wondering if I can quit using statins.

Appointment on April 12th last month.  
Meds:  ambien 10mg PRN, Rosuvastatin 10mg, multivitamin, was using creating 5gpd last couple months but have since quit.  

Use zyns 3mg probably 6-7 a day.

Hx alcohol use/binge drinking intermittently over last 5-6 years 2-3 times weekly average (3-8 white claws) but had quit except maybe once every 2-3 months in last year.  Some long periods of no alcohol. Some periods where I drank more frequently.  Do not drink currently.  Last alcohol use a week before labs or so.

For context:
	‚Ä¢	I own a La Marzocco Linea Micra and a Timemore 078s.
	‚Ä¢	Both grinders are available for me to buy locally in my country, which is a must due to warranty and consumer protection rules (so no Zerno Z1, sadly).

Pricing:
	‚Ä¢	Mazzer Philos (with I200D burrs):  ‚âà $1,370
	‚Ä¢	Lagom P64 (with SSP HU burrs): ‚âà $2,045

My reflections so far:

Mazzer Philos
Pros:
	‚Ä¢	I love that it‚Äôs stepped ‚Äî I currently have a Sculptor 078s and really dislike the grind adjustment; I hope stepped settings will make dialing in and repeatability much easier.
	‚Ä¢	Built-in grinds knocker.
	‚Ä¢	Mazzer is a well-known, established brand.
	‚Ä¢	Built like a tank ‚Äî it seems designed to last forever.

Cons:
	‚Ä¢	It seems physically quite large; that‚Äôs a bit of a concern. Would love for it to be a bit smaller.
	‚Ä¢	Fixed at 1,400 rpm, no adjustment. Not sure if this really matters, though ‚Äî my 078s has been running at ~1,000 rpm since I got it.
	‚Ä¢	Louder than the P64.

‚∏ª

Lagom P64
Pros:
	‚Ä¢	I love the looks ‚Äî it‚Äôs clean and modern.
	‚Ä¢	Can grind directly into the portafilter. Not 100% sure i would use it sll the time though.
	‚Ä¢	Feels like more of an endgame grinder. I‚Äôve drooled over it before but never thought I‚Äôd actually have a chance to own one.

Cons:
	‚Ä¢	Is it a little outdated by now? It launched a few years ago, and while the current version is improved, it‚Äôs still the same core product.
	‚Ä¢	Stepless ‚Äî though I believe dialing in coffee is still easier here than on the 078s.
	‚Ä¢	No grinds knocker (I see people tapping the top on YouTube, which feels a bit silly at this price point).
	‚Ä¢	Less well-known than Mazzer (BUT I hear great things about Option-O customer service).
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve heard about static issues and potential mess, possibly requiring RDT every time.


Any advice or thoughts?
I‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve used or compared these two grinders ‚Äî what would you pick, and why?",1,1746560875.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1kgdqgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1kgdqgl/dcf_involved_regret_calling_cops/,DCF involved. Regret calling cops,"About a month ago my husband and I had a blow up argument that resulted in him dumping out some of my cold brew and liquid vitamins (he often throws things of mine away when he is mad). I tried to grab them from him and he claimed I put him in a headlock and bit me. Nothing severe but enough it scared me. I was super angry and sad and tired of him doing this so I called the police - mostly to call his bluff. I had said I‚Äôd call next time he threw stuff out. 

The law here says that any domestic dispute when a child is in the home must be reported to DCF. My two year old was home but was not in the room. I understood that, I‚Äôm a licensed social worker as well, so I prepared myself. The case worker who reached out was super nice and after interviewing both of us and touring our home she was like ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt seem like something that rises to a level of concern for child safety so I‚Äôm going to do my due diligence and call your collaterals but I plan to close
This case. I‚Äôm not concerned unless you tell me you are.‚Äù 

Since this incident my husband HAS been better. Calling his bluff seemed to have worked and so things have been much calmer. 

Then today the DCF worker called to let me know she decided to open a case. She said she called previous jurisdictions and found out I‚Äôd called the police before (YEARS ago, before having a kid, when my husband threatened suicide then left the home.  Police came, I told them he had come back and I wasn‚Äôt concerned anymore, and they left before even getting our names. I cannot believe they found this). She also said she had concerns about some things he‚Äôd said about my drinking habits. My husband has been accusing me of alcoholism for YEARS, which literally everyone else in my life is like ‚Äúwhat??‚Äù. I almost 100% stopped drinking back in November just to shut him up and do not keep alcohol in the home. I have one drink *maybe* once a month or so when out with a friend. I‚Äôve never had trouble choosing not to drink. I admit I used to go overboard from time to time but since my kid has been born that has happened exactly ONCE, and when he called me out on it I owned it and then never let it happen again. So now DCF is claiming he had concerns there was alcohol in my coffee that he threw out and that‚Äôs why he threw it out. He had said that in the moment but I thought he was actually experiencing delusions and would not say that after he got his head on straight. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm really nervous about all this. I haven‚Äôt told him they decided to investigate yet and I‚Äôm worried how he‚Äôs going to take it. I also worry about what having this in my record will do for jobs, licensing, etc. as a social worker. My kid is safe and I‚Äôve never been concerned he would harm her. Obviously I  don‚Äôt want her growing up with parents fighting like this but I‚Äôm working on a plan to either get out or get us into therapy. They‚Äôre claiming that they just want to provide us ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and help us, but as someone who has worked in child welfare myself, I know they can really make things difficult. It makes me regret calling the police. I feel like me calling out of frustration has resulted in this massive life disruption.

1kgdm4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kgdm4e/could_the_espro_p3_french_press_review_reveal_the/,Could the ESPRO P3 French Press Review Reveal the Perfect Coffee Experience?,"Testing the **ESPRO 1432C-BK P3 French Press** has been an enriching journey as a coffee enthusiast who craves quality every morning. I never start my day without a warm cup of coffee, and this brewing device turned into a vital part of my kitchen setup. Designed with intention and precision, it pulls you closer to the art of French press brewing. While no product is a universal solution, this particular model brings plenty of features to the table, along with some quirks worth noting.

**Elegant and Durable Design**

I was particularly struck by the timeless design of this French press. The matte black finish makes it a classy addition to my countertop, and it seems to fit any kitchen style seamlessly. Measuring approximately 9.45 inches tall and 4.33 inches wide, it feels compact but capable. One standout feature is its 40% thicker glass compared to traditional French presses. This makes the product feel robust and reduces the paranoia of accidental breakage while washing or brewing. The Safety Lock mechanism holds the glass firmly in place, offering additional security during use. 

Although the design impressed me, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that it can get heavy when filled, considering it holds up to 32 ounces of coffee. While manageable for me, my younger cousin, who occasionally borrows it to brew tea, found it slightly cumbersome to carry when it was full.

**Ease of Use and Manual Operation**

Unlike some overly complicated coffee machines, this French press gets points for simplicity. It operates entirely manually, letting you stay in full control of your brewing process. The permanent filter is highly convenient and eliminates the need to keep a stash of disposable paper filters. Brewing coffee or steeping loose tea leaves becomes a satisfying ritual, and the device accommodates loose coffee grounds and tea leaves seamlessly.

I did find that its manual nature demands a bit of finesse. For casual users who dislike getting their hands too involved or just want hit-the-button brewing, this isn't the perfect match. Precision in your grind size and water temperature is crucial to optimize the filter and extract that perfect flavor.

**Dual Micro-Filter System: No Grit, No Bitterness**

If you‚Äôve ever dealt with grit sneaking into your cup, you‚Äôll appreciate the double micro-filter system here. This feature became an unexpected delight during testing. Even with coarse grind coffee‚Äîa typical choice for French press brewing‚Äîthe filters worked flawlessly to ensure every sip was smooth and free from sediment or bitterness. Each press feels consistent, and you notice the purity of flavors more distinctly compared to some lower-quality presses.

**[Check ESPRO 1432C-BK price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b011wtm622/)**

That said, the dual-filtering mechanism does create a slight challenge during cleanup. Disassembling and cleaning the two filters requires extra care, and I occasionally found myself stuck scrubbing certain areas, especially if the coffee grounds dried before washing.

**Key Benefits**

- Robust and stylish design with a matte finish.
- Double micro-filter for sediment-free, smooth coffee or tea.
- Safety Lock ensures secure use.
- The thicker glass enhances durability and insulation.
  
**Areas for Improvement**

- Cleaning the dual filter can be a bit time-consuming.
- May feel heavy when filled to capacity for some users.
- Manual brewing isn‚Äôt ideal for every lifestyle.

**Perfect Fit for Coffee Enthusiasts**

This French press feels tailored for a very specific audience‚Äîthose who take joy in a hands-on brewing routine. It encourages exploration, giving you the freedom to experiment with grind size, steeping time, and flavor notes. For casual drinkers who want speed and automation, this might not hit the right notes. However, for people like me, who find brewing coffee therapeutic, it‚Äôs a near-perfect match, minor cleaning hassles aside.

**Rival Brands**

When setting this French press against similar competitors like the [Bodum Chambord French Press](https://www.amazon.com) or the OXO Brew French Press, the differences become evident. Bodum‚Äôs Chambord has a more vintage charm with brass-finished components, but its glass isn‚Äôt as thick, and the single-layer filter allows fine grinds to slip through occasionally. OXO‚Äôs Brew French Press, another contender, offers great insulation with its stainless-steel body but feels bulkier and slightly clumsy for smaller kitchen spaces. Compared to both, the ESPRO French press excels in offering grit-free coffee with its superior micro-filter system and robust glass construction.

**Worth Every Penny**

Considering its premium features, it feels like a smart investment for those passionate about savoring exceptional coffee or tea. Although slightly pricier than some standard presses on the market, its durable build, elegant design, and unique double filter justify the cost for enthusiasts who prefer grit-free, rich brews.

I'm a Community Manager at a coworking space and the owner and I are trying to come up with nice but inexpensive gift ideas for members who will be celebrating their 1 year anniversary in the space. We also have one team celebrating 2 years in a few months. 

I'll be sending the members/teams a personal message thanking them for staying with us for a year, and try to speak with them in person, too. I'll be sending a message to virtual and in-person/physical office members, but would like a gift only for the members who actively use their office.

Some ideas I've had are a pen with the company's logo on it (very silly), a $5 gift card to a local coffee shop (some teams have 10+ members - could get pricey), or a ""Best Coworking Members"" certificate (for a special/specific team, so I might not do that).

Do other community managers do this for your coworking space? We've only been open for a year and a half, so we haven't missed too many one year anniversaries yet. Does anyone have any nice/inexpensive gift ideas?

We don‚Äôt work in the same department often, so previous I had little reason to associate with him. However, when Brad suffered an accident that left him couch-bound he ended up reaching out to me for video-game recommendations. That led to us talking about games, and then playing video-games together.
I like Brad. I don‚Äôt think he considers us out-of-work-friends. We don‚Äôt have any real/deep conversations that would allow us to get to know each other better. He barely asks me about my day or have basic small talk that isn‚Äôt game related. When I see him at work his attitude towards me shifts constantly from playful/friendly to damn near avoidant like I don‚Äôt even exist.
He seems emotionally distant and content with just being gaming buddies that make dirty jokes and innuendos at each other. I feel like I can‚Äôt even ask him how he feels towards me even on a friendly level because of an unknown boundary. For a while I‚Äôve wanted to ask him to grab coffee or something since I only physically see him at work, but his actions stops me from doing so. 

Would it be best to address our odd relationship (or lack-thereof. How would I do that?) or leave it be as it is and focus my energy and attention elsewhere?

I‚Äôm not going to put the blame all on you for how things happened between us. I know that I played a part in it. I deeply regret it.

I was glad that we reconnected. I was terrified that I had lost you for good.

You said that you were dealing with a lot in your personal life. You weren‚Äôt ready to have a conversation about our relationship yet. I didn‚Äôt have a problem with that. When you said that we should go for a coffee to vent to each other, I absolutely wanted to. I didn‚Äôt have an issue with you having to postpone it a few times for personal reasons. I am very confused about what happened at the end. You said that your life was in a mess, and that you really did want to tell me about it. You apologized for keeping me waiting for so long, and promised not to back out.

But, when I sent a message to confirm plans, you didn‚Äôt reply. I tried to give you space because I know that‚Äôs how you like to deal with things. I did send some messages checking in to see if you were ok, or if you had changed your mind about coffee. Did they stress you out? I checked today, and it looks like you‚Äôve blocked me. Did something happen?

I don‚Äôt know how to feel about you now. I hope that this isn‚Äôt the end for us. Your friendship means so much to me.  If you do decide to come back, I‚Äôll listen to what you have to say. If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm going to have a hard time moving on from you. I hope that you know I meant everything that I said that last night we hung out together, just the two of us.

1kgddar,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1kgddar/how_do_i_remove_stains_from_my_dining_chair/,How do I remove stains from my dining chair cushions?,"Removing stains from dining chair cushions can be straightforward if you follow the right steps and choose the correct cleaning method for the type of fabric and stain. The first thing to do is check if your cushions have removable covers. If they do, unzip and check the label for washing instructions. Many removable covers can be machine washed using a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Let them air dry to avoid shrinkage. For non-removable covers, you'll need to clean the fabric while it's still on the cushion.

Start by vacuuming the cushions to remove loose dirt, crumbs, and debris. Use an upholstery attachment if available to get into creases and seams. Next, identify the type of stain you‚Äôre dealing with‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs food, grease, ink, wine, or something else‚Äîbecause the treatment method can vary. For most general stains, mix a solution of warm water with a few drops of mild dish soap. Dampen a clean, white cloth with the soapy water (avoid using too much liquid, especially if the cushion is not waterproof or quick-drying) and blot the stain gently. Do not rub, as this can push the stain further into the fabric.

If the stain is greasy or oily, you may need to apply a small amount of baking soda or cornstarch first and let it sit for about 15 minutes to absorb the oil. Then vacuum it up and proceed with the soap-and-water method. For tougher stains like wine or coffee, you can try mixing a small amount of white vinegar with water (roughly equal parts) and blotting the area. Vinegar helps to break down acidic stains and neutralize odors. Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous part of the cushion first to ensure it doesn‚Äôt damage or discolor the fabric.

For ink stains, rubbing alcohol applied with a cotton swab or cloth may help lift the stain. Dab gently and then follow up with the mild soap solution to remove residue. For pet stains or odors, use an enzymatic cleaner designed for upholstery. These products break down organic material and help eliminate smells rather than masking them.

Once the stain is removed, use a clean, damp cloth to blot away any remaining soap or cleaner. Then blot with a dry towel to remove moisture. Allow the cushion to air dry completely before using it again. If possible, place the cushion in a well-ventilated area or near a fan to speed up the drying process.

Regular maintenance can help prevent future stains from setting in. Consider using a fabric protector spray that repels liquids and dirt, or add removable, washable slipcovers to your chairs. Acting quickly when a spill occurs is one of the most effective ways to prevent stains from becoming permanent. Blot up liquids immediately and treat stains within a day whenever possible.

1kgdcac,https://i.redd.it/0lcead5pq7ze1.jpeg,Coffee Quality at Downton,"I was guilty of stereotyping Brits as tea drinkers only, but noticed coffee is daily routine at DA. Drinking coffee today, I wondered if anyone knew more about coffee history in England and therefore DA. 

I know there was the India ‚Äútrading‚Äù company and that England was conquering and could get whatever it basically wanted and took. 

Recently learned that Japan is very picky about its coffee beans, test imports for mold; and the U.S. does not. (So hoping that it is the mold I have been reacting to all these years bc coffee has great polyphenols for health. So I‚Äôm trying a new brand that DOES test for mold and is grown with fulvic and humic minerals‚Äîis better, and all that jazz.) What good stuff The Crawleys must have been drinking? Would it have been adulterated by 1912? Siri tells me coffee has been in England for centuries. But I do wonder how the rest of the world didn‚Äôt know they drank it! 

The famous English black soil on one of the coasts of England comes to mind, but I guess the climate is all wrong for growing coffee plants.

What do you suppose the coffee looked like when it came to Downton‚Äîthey got it from Bakewell‚Äôs as beans and Patmore assigned someone to grind them? And would the method have been French press? ",8,1746559700.0,DowntonAbbey,2,0.9,False
1kgdc99,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1kgdc99/does_the_gplus_floor_mats_dodge_ram_20092018/,Does the G-PLUS Floor Mats Dodge Ram 2009-2018 Review Meet Expectations?,"The **G-PLUS Compatible with Dodge Ram 2009-2018 Floor Mats** got me intrigued when I first stumbled upon it. As someone who spends a lot of time on the road, keeping my truck‚Äôs interior clean, especially during unpredictable weather conditions, has always been a hassle. I decided to give these floor mats a shot, and honestly, they surprised me in both good ways and some areas that could use improvement.

**Design and Material Quality**  
Right out of the box, the floor mats felt sturdy and well-constructed. They are made from TPE material, which initially sounded a bit fancy to me, but after some research, I learned it‚Äôs highly durable and resistant to extreme temperatures. These mats didn‚Äôt produce any peculiar odors, even when left in a hot vehicle for hours, which is a huge plus. Subtle aesthetics elevated the inside of my Dodge Ram, reducing tread marks and keeping the vibe pristine.

**Usability and Cleaning Effort**  
One aspect I find crucial in floor mats is how easy they are to clean. I‚Äôve tested mats before that claimed to be ‚Äúwashable,‚Äù but turned into a nightmare when I tried to scrub off dried mud. These mats? A dream. All it took was a quick shake and a rinse under the garden hose, and they looked as good as new. They‚Äôre also foldable, which helped when I wanted to stash them temporarily. Let‚Äôs just say there have been moments when convenience matters, and these mats delivered.

**Performance and Fit**  
The fit for my Dodge Ram Crew Cab was near perfect. Despite being marketed as ‚Äúvehicle-specific,‚Äù I was a little skeptical. I‚Äôve been burned by so-called custom-fit mats that turn out to be a one-size-fits-most situation. But not these. They hugged the interior of my truck snugly, leaving no room for debris or liquids to slip through. With rainy seasons around the corner, the waterproofing and coverage of these mats provided peace of mind. I even spilled coffee once, and the containment edges effectively kept it from soaking into the carpet.

**Check [G-PLUS Compatible with Dodge Ram 2009-2018 Floor Mats] price on Amazon.**

**Strengths**  
- Material with superior durability and no lingering chemical smell over time.  
- Perfect fit for my truck without sliding or curling up.  
- Hassle-free cleaning process that genuinely restored them to their original look.
- Excellent for protecting the vehicle interior from mud, snow, or accidental beverage spills.  

**Shortcomings**  
- While the mats feel solid, they don‚Äôt work with the Quad Cab configurations, which limits flexibility in vehicle compatibility.  
- Folding them, though convenient for storage, caused minor creases initially, and it took some time for them to fully flatten out.  
- A tad pricier than some generic all-weather mats which may be hard to justify for occasionally light-duty users.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
I recently compared these mats with WeatherTech and Husky Liners, which are staples in the floor mat game. While the G-PLUS variety excels in its snug fit and odor-free material, other competitors bring a wider model range. WeatherTech feels built for toughness, but I found their mats too rigid for my taste, making them slightly tricky to clean. Husky, on the other hand, has awesome non-slip backing but isn‚Äôt visually as sleek. In terms of balancing long-lasting durability and vehicle-specific design, G-PLUS holds its own remarkably well.

**Value Proposition**  
These mats sit in a sweet spot between premium all-weather liners and more affordable choices. While the initial cost might seem slightly higher compared to some weaker alternatives, you‚Äôre paying for something built to last with thoughtful features like easy maintenance, thermal resilience, and spill containment.

1kgdayr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1kgdayr/proteinpacked_snacks_under_150_calories_you_can/,Protein-Packed Snacks Under 150 Calories You Can Prep Ahead,"Hey, friend! Ever find yourself starving mid-afternoon, rummaging through the pantry for *something* that won‚Äôt wreck your macros? I‚Äôve been there, and let me tell you, prepping **protein-packed snacks** that clock in under **150 calories** is a game-changer. These babies keep you full, fuel your muscles, and‚Äîbest of all‚Äîare ready to grab when hanger strikes. Let‚Äôs chat about some tasty, make-ahead snacks that‚Äôll save your sanity and your diet. Ready?

# Why Protein Snacks Are Your New BFF

Protein is the MVP for keeping you satisfied. It‚Äôs like the friend who always shows up when you need them. Unlike carb-heavy snacks that leave you crashing faster than my Wi-Fi during a storm, protein keeps your energy steady and your cravings in check. Plus, these snacks are **low-calorie** (under 150, duh) and perfect for prepping ahead. Who‚Äôs got time to cook when you‚Äôre juggling life? Not me.

# The Magic of Meal Prep

Ever wondered why meal prep feels like a secret weapon? It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre setting yourself up for success before the chaos hits. Prepping snacks means you‚Äôre less likely to dive into that bag of chips when you‚Äôre stressed. These recipes are quick, store well, and‚ÄîIMO‚Äîtaste better than anything from a vending machine.

# Calorie Control Without the Sad Vibes

Low-calorie doesn‚Äôt mean boring. I used to think ‚Äúhealthy snacks‚Äù meant choking down celery sticks (ugh). But these options? They‚Äôre flavorful, satisfying, and won‚Äôt leave you dreaming of pizza. Let‚Äôs get to the good stuff.

# Snack #1: Greek Yogurt Parfait Bites

I‚Äôm obsessed with these little guys. They‚Äôre like dessert, but without the guilt trip. **Greek yogurt** is a protein powerhouse, and when you freeze it into bite-sized portions, you‚Äôve got a snack that‚Äôs portable and refreshing. Perfect for those ‚ÄúI need something sweet‚Äù moments.

# How to Make ‚ÄòEm

* Grab some **plain Greek yogurt** (non-fat or 2% works great, about **10g protein per 100g**).
* Mix in a teaspoon of honey or a few drops of stevia for sweetness.
* Spoon into silicone mini-muffin molds. Top with a sprinkle of **chia seeds** or a few blueberries.
* Freeze for 2‚Äì3 hours. Pop ‚Äòem out and store in a freezer bag.

**Calories**: \~**120 per 3 bites** (depending on yogurt brand).  
**Protein**: \~**8‚Äì10g**.  
**Pro Tip**: Keep these in a cooler bag if you‚Äôre on the go. They thaw slightly but stay creamy. üòä

# Why I Love It

I once brought these to a work meeting, and my coworkers acted like I‚Äôd invented fire. They‚Äôre stupidly easy to make, and the protein punch keeps me from raiding the office candy jar. Plus, they‚Äôre customizable‚Äîswap in different fruits or even a dash of cocoa powder.

# Snack #2: Turkey Roll-Ups

Okay, hear me out: **turkey roll-ups** are the unsung heroes of snacking. They‚Äôre savory, portable, and feel like a mini-meal. I started making these when I was cutting for a fitness challenge, and they saved me from boring protein bars.

# How to Make ‚ÄòEm

* Take 2 slices of **low-sodium deli turkey** (about **50 calories** and **10g protein**).
* Spread a thin layer of **light cream cheese** (1 tsp, \~20 calories).
* Add a slice of cucumber or a few spinach leaves for crunch.
* Roll tightly, slice into bite-sized pieces, and store in an airtight container.

**Calories**: \~**100 per 2 rolls**.  
**Protein**: \~**10g**.  
**Pro Tip**: Prep a batch on Sunday, and they‚Äôll last in the fridge for 4‚Äì5 days.

# Why They Rock

These are my go-to when I‚Äôm running errands and don‚Äôt trust myself near a drive-thru. The cream cheese adds just enough richness to make you forget you‚Äôre eating ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù Ever tried pairing these with a coffee? Game. Changer.

# Snack #3: Edamame Power Packs

Raise your hand if you‚Äôve underestimated **edamame**. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è These little green beans are protein-packed and ridiculously easy to prep. I discovered them during a vegan phase (don‚Äôt judge), and they‚Äôve been a staple ever since.

# How to Make ‚ÄòEm

* Buy **shelled edamame** (frozen is fine, \~**120 calories per cup**).
* Boil for 3‚Äì5 minutes, then drain and toss with a pinch of sea salt or chili flakes.
* Portion into small containers (about ¬æ cup per serving).
* Store in the fridge for up to a week.

**Calories**: \~**130 per ¬æ cup**.  
**Protein**: \~**11g**.  
**Pro Tip**: Sprinkle with a tiny bit of garlic powder for extra flavor without calories.

# Why I‚Äôm Obsessed

Edamame is like popcorn‚Äîyou can‚Äôt stop munching. It‚Äôs satisfying, and the protein keeps me full for hours. I once ate these during a Netflix binge and didn‚Äôt even miss my usual chips. That‚Äôs a win in my book.

# Snack #4: Hard-Boiled Egg Whites with a Twist

Egg whites sound basic, but don‚Äôt sleep on them. They‚Äôre dirt-cheap, protein-dense, and versatile. I started jazzing mine up after getting bored with plain ones, and now they‚Äôre a fridge staple.

# How to Make ‚ÄòEm

* Boil 4‚Äì6 eggs (pro tip: 10 minutes for perfect hard-boiled).
* Peel and separate the whites (2 whites = 1 serving, \~**34 calories**).
* Sprinkle with **everything bagel seasoning** or a dash of hot sauce.
* Store in a container for up to 5 days.

**Calories**: \~**40 per 2 whites** (seasoning adds negligible calories).  
**Protein**: \~**7g**.  
**Pro Tip**: Keep the yolks for a salad if you‚Äôre feeling fancy.

# Why They‚Äôre Awesome

These are my ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too lazy to cook‚Äù snack. The seasoning makes them feel gourmet without any effort. Ever tried eating these on a busy morning? They‚Äôre like a protein hug.

# Snack #5: Tuna Salad Cups

Tuna gets a bad rap, but when done right, it‚Äôs a **protein-packed** dream. These mini salad cups are quick, cheap, and perfect for when you need something substantial but light.

# How to Make ‚ÄòEm

* Mix a can of **tuna in water** (drained, **100 calories**, **20g protein**) with 1 tbsp **light mayo** (35 calories) and a dash of mustard.
* Add chopped celery or pickles for crunch.
* Scoop into **lettuce cups** (romaine or butter lettuce works, \~5 calories per leaf).
* Store in the fridge for 2‚Äì3 days.

**Calories**: \~**140 per 2 cups**.  
**Protein**: \~**15g**.  
**Pro Tip**: Make a big batch, but keep the lettuce separate until you‚Äôre ready to eat to avoid sogginess.

# Why I Can‚Äôt Quit Them

I brought these to a picnic once, and people thought I was some kind of health guru. They‚Äôre filling, fresh, and the mustard gives just enough zing. FYI, they‚Äôre also great for meal-prep lunches if you want to double the portion.

# Tips for Snack Prep Success

Alright, let‚Äôs wrap this up with some real talk. Prepping snacks is only awesome if you actually do it. Here‚Äôs how to make it stick:

* **Batch it**: Set aside 30 minutes on Sunday to prep everything. It‚Äôs less overwhelming than doing it daily.
* **Get cute containers**: I swear, fun Tupperware makes me more excited to eat healthy. Don‚Äôt ask why.
* **Mix it up**: Rotate these snacks weekly so you don‚Äôt get bored. Nobody wants to eat the same thing forever.
* **Keep it accessible**: Store snacks at eye level in the fridge or in your bag. Out of sight, out of mind, right?

# Final Thoughts

So, there you have it‚Äîfive **protein-packed snacks** that won‚Äôt break the calorie bank and are ready when you are. Whether you‚Äôre dodging office donuts or just trying to stay on track, these snacks are your new secret weapon. Which one are you trying first? Hit me up in the comments (or, ya know, just tell your fridge). Keep it healthy, keep it fun, and let‚Äôs snack smarter together. üòé",1,1746559607.0,Fitnessplates,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! Let‚Äôs talk about that secret sauce we all wish we had a gallon of‚Äîour personal ""unfair advantage"" that supercharges our productivity. You know, those little habits that feel like cheating, yet they‚Äôre totally fair game. 

For me, it‚Äôs all about my **morning routine**‚ÄîI‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs the cheat code to success!  Here‚Äôs how it plays out:

- **Wake Up Early:** I know, I know‚Äîwaking up early sounds like a punishment devised by the universe. But hear me out! There‚Äôs something magical about those quiet morning hours. The world is asleep, and it‚Äôs just you and your dreams (or a strong cup of coffee). 

- **No Phone Zone:** As soon as I wake up, I keep my phone away for at least the first 30 minutes. Seriously, scrolling through social media before functioning is like trying to run a marathon with one shoe. Just don‚Äôt do it!

- **Mindfulness Moments:** Five minutes of deep breathing or meditation helps clear the mental fog. Ever felt chaos in your head? This is like hitting the reset button. 

- **Write It Out:** I‚Äôve started jotting down three things I‚Äôm grateful for and three tasks I want to tackle that day. Nothing crazy, just simple stuff that primes my brain for action. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love checking things off a list? Feels like winning, right?

- **Move Your Body:** Whether it‚Äôs a quick stretch, a brisk walk, or some dance moves to your favorite jam, getting the blood flowing releases those feel-good endorphins. It's like giving your brain a high five!

Now it‚Äôs your turn! What‚Äôs *your* go-to habit that gives you that edge? Is it a quirky coffee ritual? A specific playlist that pumps you up? Or maybe a wild midnight snack that fuels your creative genius? 

Let‚Äôs swap our tips and tricks! I truly believe that sharing insights can help us level up each other‚Äôs game. So, what‚Äôs the one habit you won‚Äôt let go of, no matter what? üåü",1,1746559586.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Lulu has suddenly deemed my book in contravention of their agreement and cancelled my order and closed my account. They have not given any specifics of how my project breaks their rules and they are sending me this SIX MONTHS after I first started printing the project with Lulu. 

The project is  coffee table book comprised of text (written by me) and photos (shot by my coauthor and also licensed from a legit stock photo company.) The book features interviews with famous musicians from the 90s, (conducted by me and written by me.) and many photos. 

The notice from Lulu says my book  ""may be in violation of the Lulu Membership Agreement which states your project cannot contain material that is intellectual property of another, invasive of privacy rights, defamatory or otherwise questionable and/or determined by us in our sole discretion to violate our Membership Agreement.""  

I am guessing they might be objecting to the cover image (which is a famous musician shot in a very stylized out of focus style so there is no recognizable face.) My understanding of the legalities is that COVER art is treated differently than editorial content (photos inside the book itself.) And further that IF I used  the likeness of a recognizable famous face on the cover, I would likely be on thin ground legally. However, to restate, my book's cover has no recognizable face on it. 

To make matters worse, Lulu has no customer service phone number (unless anyone here has one they can share) and are slow to reply to emails. And worse than that they have cancelled my account and stated that I cannot open a new one. 

  
All this is happening with ZERO info or recourse. Needless to say this is a big problem for me as I have spent almost a year and many thousands of dollars creating this book - and now it has been canceled with no clear reason. 

  
Any advice very much appreciated (on how to get Lulu to reverse this and/or an alternative printing company that can print high quality coffee table type books?

So I generally am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to nutrition. I know how to lose weight, I know how to be healthy, I know about macros etc. But my personal appetite fluctuates a lot. I‚Äôm eating 1200-1500 calories a day to be in a deficit. I‚Äôm 11 pounds down so far, and have about 15-20 left to go. 

Some days I‚Äôm SO HUNGRY that I need to eat 3 meals a day, but other days I‚Äôm just not hungry until way later into the evening. So maybe 4 days out of the week I just won‚Äôt be hungry at all til maybe 7pm. I‚Äôve been eating 2 protein bars when this happens at around 2pm to hold me down.

It‚Äôs been going great. I feel great, my stomach feels fine, everything feels good, and I can kind of eat as much as I want for dinner without really thinking about it. (Usually I eat about 400 calories at dinner, but with only having 400 calories between the bars and coffee, I can eat up to 800 for dinner if I wanted to!) 

If I don‚Äôt reach my calories, I always supplement with some nuts, avocado or yogurt. I never go under my calorie limit.

Just wondering if this is fine to do? If my boyfriend said he did this I‚Äôd be concerned, but doing it myself feels fine. Just wanted some insight? Is there any actual things wrong with doing this? 

They‚Äôre Nugo bars so they‚Äôre delicious and have only 11g of protein per bar if that helps. More of an energy bar. No fake sweeteners, just agave.

Iced coffee, no sugar, a little oat milk

Then again I am confused and scared because any transactions done online work as digital proof, which can be scary if I don't know, God forbid what happens.
I did mention to him that I am a girl who comes from a good background, and this isn't anything escort like, and apparently he resents the same thought and says ofc this isn't anything like that.
I did say though that for the first meet, I would like to meet him over coffee, which even he seemed to agree to and his major focus was on taking it slow and trying to understand each other and seeing if we VIBE! (what am I a disco ball?)

So please help me out because I don't know how to approach the situation or what to even think of it because it just feels too good to be true.
Very honestly I used to think I am not cut out for this but yolo got me into thinking that it is okay to have some fun and adventure in life, but I don't know.

I am staying in a Lojman right around the corner from Boƒüazici university but most of the people in my house are married middle aged couples. I'm active in the Couchsurfing (travel app) community in Istanbul but most of their meetups are in Taksim and Kadik√∂y so I'd like to have more friends in my area.

I only just moved to Istanbul 6 weeks ago but I'm pretty well acquainted with Turkey. I'd say my Turkish is around A1 level, but I'm pretty well acquainted with Turkish (political) culture.

I'm not really fussy about things to do. Beer, coffee (obv not Espressolab üòÇ), football, walks - whatever. I just graduated in political science in February and I'm a politics nerd who loves to travel to weird places. I'd consider myself pretty adventurous, so would definitely be down for (weekend) trips :D

1kgcsfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DopamineDetoxing/comments/1kgcsfj/signs_that_your_dopamine_receptors_are_fried_my/,Signs That Your Dopamine Receptors Are Fried (My Story),"Personally, I had fried dopamine receptors for a couple of years. It started slowly in my early teens when I began eating fast food and sugar, while spending most of my time in front of a PC, mindlessly consuming content that pumped me full of artificial dopamine. My drive slowly disappeared, and I stopped seeing life the same way.

Eventually, I started using caffeine and nicotine to cope. That‚Äôs when the descent into hell really began.

After a couple of years of these habits, my body went from constant fight/flight mode into full on freeze mode / Dorsal vagal shutdown. One weird thing that happened was that the vascular vein in my neck became constantly visible and pulsating, my body was stuck in a permanent stress state. My tolerance for stimulants, nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol became insane. I could drink six cups of coffee and feel nothing. I could take 50mg nicotine pouches without a hint of euphoria, just anxiety and discomfort. I could drink half a liter of vodka and stay fully aware, no buzz, no joy, nothing. - If your dopamine receptors are truly fried, this is what happens.

At that point, my sense of smell vanished. My nose was always stuffed, I couldn‚Äôt tolerate most foods without getting hit with waves of anxiety and dread. Every morning, I woke up miserable, apathetic, and irritable. No amount of nicotine or caffeine helped. I felt nothing, no pleasure from sex, no enjoyment from movies, nothing from everyday life. My vocabulary also diminished, I could barely form a coherent sentence and couldn‚Äôt talk to strangers without looking like an anxious fool. Anxiety ruled my life at that point.

The funniest thing is that when I was out with my friends drinking, I had half a liter of vodka beforehand and drank a ton at the party. Still, my friends asked, ‚ÄúHave you even had a drink yet? You seem completely sober.‚Äù I drink alcohol maybe three times a year, yet my tolerance was so high it wasn‚Äôt even worth it.

That‚Äôs when I realized I had to change. I had to return to nature and its laws.

So I did.

I quit social media and focused on living in the present, talking to real people around me. I switched to a boring but anti-inflammatory, healing diet consisting of Fresh Lean Meat/Fish/Seafood, White Potatoes/Rice/Berries, Sea Salt, Still Water. I quit nicotine, caffeine, and all stimulants. I dropped out of my studies to focus on healing. I spent most of my days sleeping, not doing anything that would potentially make me stressed.

For a few months, it was hell. I felt worse than ever. But then something shifted.

My sense of smell returned.  The feeling of being able to smell your bed sheets, the grass gave me instant nostalgia from the years I had missed. I started feeling dopamine again, real joy from real things, like socializing and being outdoors. I tried alcohol again, and this time I actually felt the buzz, the joy. My ability to remember my dreams also returned. My hormone levels went up after being nearly nonexistent, depleted by years of constant stress.

It's honestly insane how much fried dopamine receptors ruin your life. Embrace boredom, it is the price you pay for the reward of truly feeling alive.",3,1746558327.0,DopamineDetoxing,2,1.0,False
1kgcs5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kgcs5x/kinda_stressing_about_adding_more_daily_calories/,"kinda stressing about adding more daily calories as I transition from a medical weight management meal replacement program to ""real food""","As the title says, I am getting a bit anxious about transitioning from an extremely low calorie medical weight management program with a diet consisting of full meal replacements to one that has ""real food"" in it. At the beginning of December I entered a medical weight management program and since then have been eating about 950-1100 calories per day of shakes/soups/bars as part of the program. Everything has been going great while on the meal replacements, and I have dropped a bit over 110lbs in this time. However, now I am about 4 weeks into the transition back to food, and I feel like I'm being compulsive with the calorie counting and restriction. 

I have been tediously counting every single calorie every single day in the MyFitnessPal app since mid-December, and I always felt good about seeing the nice, even numbers every day since I was consuming a specific number of meal replacements. Now that I am adding a few meals per day of actual food, and adding protein/calories in general as part of that, I've had a few days where I cut up an extra oz of carrot for my salad or add an extra couple of oz of shrimp to my impossible burger stir-fry for dinner, and the calorie count comes to a ""crazy high"" 1800 calories and it is really messing with me mentally. 

like, I know 1800 calories is still pretty low for someone of my size, but it just seems like an insane amount of food. I keep my snacks to 200 calories (with at least 20g of protein) and lunches to about 400 calories (with at least 40g of protein) and that's fine, but some of the dinners I make are pushing close to 800 calories and it is freaking me out a little. The MWM program shoots for 250 calorie meals 5-7x per day, but it is a real pain in the ass to plan, prep and consume that many on a regular day. 

On a typical day my diet looks like this:

Breakfast = 400-450 calories 

* coffee + meal replacement shake (160 calories)
* Oikos pro or Ratio greek yogurt (~140-170 calories)
* 200g mixed berries (strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, blackberry for 80-100 calories)
* 6g honey (18 calories)

Lunch = 400-450 calories

* 100g spring mix + baby spinach blend (30 calories)
* 2oz sauerkraut (20 calories)
* 2oz kimchi (20 calories)
* 50g celery (10 calories)
* 50g broccoli (20 calories)
* 50g carrots (20 calories)
* 100g cucumbers (10 calories)
* 50g pepperoncinis (10 calories)
* 2 cans of tuna (150-200 calories)
* 2oz avocado (100 calories)

pre-workout snack = 210 calories

* 3oz plain greek yogurt (50 calories)
* protein bar (160 calories)

Dinner = 700 calories

* 4oz 93/7 ground beef (170 calories)
* 180g shrimp (170 calories)
* 3oz onion (35 calories)
* 4.5oz brussels sprouts (45 calories)
* 4.5oz cauliflower (35 calories)
* 4.5oz broccoli (55 calories)
* 5oz mushrooms (35 calories)
* 1tbsp gochujang (50 calories)
* 1tsp chili crisp (35 calories)
* 1.5tsp EVOO (60 calories)

This was copied from MFP from yesterday, and comes out to 1770 calories. For additional context, I have a mostly sedentary job, but have been walking at least 10k steps per day (up to 25-30k some days) and do an hour of strength training with a trainer in the gym 3x per week. My energy and hunger levels are good, but I feel like ~1800 calories is a crazy amount of food and I really have to push myself to consume that much. It's just so much food, and I feel like I am setting myself up for more binge failures in the future. I could ask in my MWM class (and I probably will), but they kinda freak out if you go over 250 calories per meal or under 7 meals per day, so I figured I would ask here if this is reasonable.",1,1746558308.0,loseit,11,1.0,False

1kgcqxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthybodyhappylife/comments/1kgcqxs/polycystic_ovarian_syndrome/,POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME,"Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. PCOS. 

The syndrome of the excess testosterone 

You may have heard of it. The modern ‚Äúplague‚Äù, associated with:

- Scalp hair loss but - frustratingly - increased facial hair
- Acne
- Irregular periods
- Occasional struggles with fertility 

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - Survivorship

PCOS is consistently blamed on women being ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù. PCOS occurs in familial clusters with:

- The so-called Syndrome X
    - Hypertension
    - Elevated cholesterol 
    - Abnormal blood sugar levels
    - Excess fat around the waist
- Type 2 diabetes
- Cardiovascular heart disease 

What if I told you that this ‚Äúdisease‚Äù is not a sign of a weak or faulty body, but rather the result of a strong, healthy, inbuilt survival mechanism? 

Underpinning all these conditions is the presence of the Insulin Resistance (IR) phenomenon. IR is a powerful genetic survival mechanism - the ‚Äúthrifty genotype‚Äù. People with PCOS have IR genes. These genes enabled ancestors, in eons past, to utilise every calorie efficiently, by effectively storing spare energy (calories) as fat. Fat stores enabled people to survive through the nutritional challenges of famine, illness and voyage across land and sea. In contrast to insulin resistance, insulin ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù people had lower fat stores and often perished during these obstacles. Thus, IR ancestors passed this genetic profile down through the generations, as they survived and bred. Thrifty, indeed!

There was little opportunity for insulin resistance to cause disease in the ancient conditions of an appetite-satisfying diet of high protein meats and high fibre plants. The intermittent food supply kept blood sugars stable and prevented too much fat gain. Daily activity through hunting and gathering burnt up calories and encouraged muscle building. Instead, IR packed away just enough fat to last through the next energy deficit. IR kept ancestors alive through food-poor times, and the natural food and activity environment prevented too much fat storage during times of food-availability.

PCOS: A toxic relationship between good genes and bad environment 

However, in this modern, toxic environment of meals based around processed food, a constant supply of low fibre treats and sedentary patterns of work and play, the previously desirable insulin resistance trait now acts on a huge excess of calories to build large reserves of fat, especially around the mid section. With low levels of activity and thus reduction in calorie burning and muscle, IR causes metabolic havoc. Insulin and body fat interact to signal the ovaries to produce excess testosterone - and PCOS results. 

Management or Reversal of PCOS

Upon understanding this, the foundations of reversing PCOS become self evident. 

Build Muscle
Ever heard of ‚Äúthin PCOS‚Äù sufferers? The real issue in this subgroup is insulin resistance plus muscle deficit. Simple compound resistance exercises and a higher protein diet, would create muscle gain and restore the balance of body fat to muscle, reducing excess insulin and thus ameliorating many of the symptoms. So tofu, fish, meat, cheese and eggs, and three times a week:

- Squats 3 sets of 12
- Planks build to one minute

Lose Fat
As for those with fat to lose - eat like your ancestors. Undergird your diet with plants and protein, add in a small amount of healthy fats and round out with some portion controlled, soul-satisfying carbs. For example: 

What to eat

Examples of the above dietary guidelines:

Breakfast - eggs and spinach on one piece of whole grain toast

Lunch - salad with tuna or cheese

Dinner: Tofu or organic meat stir-fry with some nuts and half a cup of rice for dinner. 

How to Eat

Like the IR ancestors, minimise between meal snacks - a little high fat yogurt or a couple of cheeky pieces of dark chocolate. After dinner, stick to herbal teas or decaf coffee. This results in building in some ‚Äúfasts‚Äù through the day. 

Movement - Keep Busy
 
Aim for 10,000 steps a day, and as above add in some planks and squats a couple of times a week.

Measure around the waist once a month and keep an eye on your symptoms. Request an appointment with an endocrinologist, especially if you are thinking of starting a family. 

That‚Äôs the way forwards - or, really, backwards, for those with PCOS.

With its sleek silver design and durable stainless steel finish, it effortlessly blends into my modern kitchen. The attention to detail in the compact 11.2"" x 8.3"" x 12.5"" size means it doesn‚Äôt hog counter real estate. Despite its compactness, this espresso machine boasts powerhouse capabilities. You might think I have a personal barista at home, judging by the number of lattes and espressos I‚Äôve brewed since it arrived. Let me walk you through my experience.

**Ease of Use Meets Advanced Features**  
Touchscreen technology on this espresso maker elevates its user-friendliness. Navigating through options is seamless, even for my parents, who are not particularly tech-savvy. With just a few taps, I can adjust settings to brew an espresso, a latte, or prepare foam ‚Äì yes, it‚Äôs practically foolproof. One standout feature is the dual-pump system. With 20-bar pressure for espressos and a separate 4-bar pump for frothing milk, this machine ensures the coffee and milk are brewed with precision. 

[Ready to snag URintells Cuising EM5120-US? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dfwbcyfj/)

**Comprehensive Milk Frothing!**  
As a latte enthusiast, the milk frothing system won me over. It's not just automatic; it‚Äôs adjustable, allowing creamier foam for cappuccinos or a light latte texture. I even discovered that holding the ‚Äúdouble cappuccino‚Äù button for five seconds lets you froth milk without brewing espresso! This came in handy when I wanted to prepare vanilla chai lattes without espresso. The froth consistency rivals any specialty coffee shop, and the control milk reservoir knob makes experimenting easy for beginners like my sister, who‚Äôs now hooked on homemade mochas.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The solid build of this coffee maker ensures it feels more premium than many other options in its range. The removable 34oz water tank and 23oz milk reservoir make it super convenient to clean and refill. Plus, the stainless steel drip tray is detachable, which means tall cups are a go. Whether it's a quick espresso shot in the morning or an oversized latte bowl on weekends, I‚Äôm covered.

**Pros**  
- Responsive touchscreen, thoughtfully designed for fast operation.  
- Compact yet robust; fits effortlessly into smaller kitchens.  
- Dual heating and pump systems ensure optimal coffee and milk temperatures.  
- Adjustable milk froth feature works incredibly well.  

**Cons**  
- A bit noisy during milk frothing; not a huge issue, but worth noting.  
- Requires regular cleaning of removable parts to maintain performance.  
- Although sturdy, the plastic parts could feel more premium.  

**Market Rivals**  
I‚Äôve had prior experience with Breville and De‚ÄôLonghi espresso machines, so naturally, I compared. The Breville Barista Express is magnificent when it comes to sheer craftsmanship and advanced customization but carries a hefty price. While De‚ÄôLonghi‚Äôs automatic frothing system is beginner-friendly, its frothing isn‚Äôt always consistent. What sets the URintells Cuising apart is the perfect midground: fantastic features, an intuitive interface, and accessible pricing ‚Äì all without overwhelming complexity. The Breville commands a higher price tag, which makes this model stand out as a budget-conscious alternative with almost no compromise on performance.

**Financial Value**  
Given its advanced dual-pump technology, powerful 1350W and 900W heating systems, and intuitive functionality, the price makes sense. Every aspect, from brewing speed to milk foam control, feels deliberately crafted for value. Its operational cost is remarkably lower than daily Starbucks runs ‚Äì the machine was practically paying for itself two weeks into use.

This decision was a long time coming, but of course I'm still having many mixed and complicated feelings about it. While I always recognized that my Q drank too much, it wasn't a major issue in our relationship for the first year or so. I also understand that this is likely because my own drinking had escalated during the beginning of COVID. However, after the first 2 years, he became increasingly unpredictable when drunk. Initially, it was just general emotions that would come out - he'd be frustrated with work, the world, whatever, and I would be the listening ear to his rants. Next, though, he'd be angry with me. I've always thought of myself as strong, independent. I have graduate degrees and a high drive for success, and so more than anything, I feel a deep amount of shame for what I tolerated for so long. I convinced myself for a long time that the trauma he had from his childhood was to blame, but I recently more freely admitted (to myself and others) the amount of verbal, emotional, and even physical abuse that I dealt with. Of course, I could never talk to him about the way he spoke or behaved. Even when I waited for the ""perfect"" moments - when he was sober, awake for a few hours, had drank coffee and eaten - there was always a reason why he couldn't discuss these issues. I walked on eggshells for so long, and I'm only just now starting to understand how deeply it has affected me. 

After a particularly bad bender weekend for him (where he stayed out all night, screamed at me repeatedly and broke up with me, and then pretended that nothing happened), I let him know that I would be moving out. After a similar situation, we briefly split 6 months ago and he had promised to move out, but we ended up reconciling because he essentially never made any plans to move and stopped drinking for a couple weeks. He's promised numerous times over the past few years to either: stop doing shots, stop drinking while at work (he's a bartender), stop drinking for a month, stop drinking altogether. Obviously, none of those things have happened, although he does still seem to believe that he didn't drink for several months last year. He made similar promises this time, but I somehow found the strength to hold firm and not get sucked back into his cycle of drinking and abuse. 

I managed to find and move into a new apartment within 2 weeks, and the positives have been overwhelmingly positive. I have slept more soundly and peacefully than I have in years. I'm not on edge waiting for him to come home, wondering if he'll just pass out on the couch or if he'll have some drunken anger to take out on me. I'm excited to go to work in the morning, and I don't find every single day exhausting. I can just relax in my home now, and I can already feel the healing powers of that. 

However, as many of you are familiar with, I'm also dealing with a lot of guilt. Guilt that I am so happy, while I'm pretty sure he's spent the last few days drowning in red wine and Irish whisky, not eating any food. He's seemed fine on the mornings I've been in the old apartment, cleaning and moving my stuff, but he'll text cryptic or angry messages at 3 or 4 in the morning. I worry deeply about his ability to take care of himself, but he's also a grown man in his 40's. I want to step away, but I still feel the desire to be a potential source of support for him. I've always struggled with letting go, but this has also been the most serious and long-term relationship of my life. That, combined with our shared friend group, is making it difficult to just wash my hands of the whole thing and walk away. I'm in my 30's, and I don't want to lose my whole friend group in order to avoid him.

1kgchbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kgchbd/need_advice_i_think_my_spouse_has_become_someones/,Need advice - I think my spouse has become someone‚Äôs FO,"Made a typo in the title FO= FP Deliberating being place and pronoun vague to protect peoples identities. I‚Äôm not even sure if this is the right sub to post this on my really need some advice. After some research into BPD I believe that my spouse has become a person with BPD‚Äôs  Favourite person. Really trying to sound non bias in my writing here but it‚Äôs tricky as I have a lot of feelings around the situation. 

It started 6 months ago and they‚Äôve been in contact pretty much every single day in one way or another since then. At first I didn‚Äôt think much on it myself and my spouse are in an open marriage so we regular go through phases of messaging other people etc. However I was a bit unsure of my spouse messaging the pwBPD because they are not non monogamous and had upcoming  wedding. 

The pwBPD confided a lot of very intimate personal information very soon after the friendship starting including telling my spouse that they have BPD and also making sure my spouse knew that very few people know that about them. 

My spouse and the pwBPD met at a local business where the pwBPD worked, the business followed me on Instagram and shortly after they became friends I noticed that the business profile started viewing my stories regularly (I have a private account) which I suspected was the pwBPD viewing my stories and they also viewed at my LinkedIn profile. All happened early on and I thought maybe they‚Äôre just curious. But then after this my spouse tells to me  they‚Äôve been messaging every single day for a few weeks, I became a bit more suspicious. At one point the messages became sexual, sexting in itself I‚Äôm not too bothered about like I said we have an open marriage, it just made me uncomfortable knowing that this was all going on behind the pwBPDS partners back. And I didn‚Äôt really know what the pwBPD was after. Usually when we date people outside of our marriage it‚Äôs people from the ENM communities and there are firm boundaries in place. and there is a level of respect for everyone‚Äôs  partners etc. in this case there seemed to be none. 

A couple of times my partner has tried to put boundaries in place by cutting down messaging realising that the constant contact probably wasn‚Äôt right or healthy. But the pwBPD always finds a way to contact them or seemingly to get their attention. (Ie messaging on Instagram instead or post a new picture of themselves  on Instagram etc) the only boundary that seems to actually stay in place is that they have not been physically intimate with each other. My spouse has always said they don‚Äôt mind the strangeness of the relationship and that they just really like the pwBPD and they feel like they can be themselves around them. The pwBPD has made every effort to completely normalise everyday contact saying things like it‚Äôs just like chatting on msn or that they have other friends who they are in contact with everyday. My spouse is also regularly coming home with stuff they pwBPD has given them and the pwBPD I has offered free trials or extend trials at the local business they work for also free tickets to events etc. 

My spouse seems to have become their number one confident. The pwBPD has apparently had some issues at work with their boss and somehow my spouse was the only one they could talk to about the problems they‚Äôre going through. And telling my spouse that they can‚Äôt tell their own partner about this. They have also expresses an interest in non monongmoy and has said things that have led my spouse to believe that they are in a controlling  relationship. My spouse says the pwBPD has been very flattering to them and saying how much they‚Äôve learnt from them etc. The pwBPD has also expressed annoyance that I am aware of their friendship. Me and my partner practice radically honesty so if she‚Äôs participating in behaviours that might been seen as disrespectful or potentially have repercussions on our relationship they‚Äôll tell me about it which is why I know about it and why they told me about the pwBPD having bpd. 

My spouse loves to empower people and help build their self confidence as a couple and separately we‚Äôre into self improvement and always try to get friends and loved ones to emotional stand on their own feet. So this seems to have been the role my partner has place in the pwBPD life. 
And I feel that has probably been very validating to the pwBPD 
The pwBPD just got married despite indicating to my spouse that they don‚Äôt  really want to do so and indicating they feel trapped by their relationship. 

Something in my gut is saying that this could all become very toxic. For instance my partner feels the need to let the pwBPD know when they‚Äôre not going to be in contact with them. For instance my spouse didn‚Äôt message the pwBPD on our wedding anniversary the pwBPD seems to accept it but obviously I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre actually thinking. 

Their relationship mainly takes place over WhatsApp. They have been out for coffee etc. And my spouse even invited the pwBPD over for brunch in an off the cuff way. But suddenly weeks after the invite the pwBPD remembers about the invite  mand says they‚Äôre free to come round. And the pwBPD  has also already arranged a meet up with my spouse the week after they get back from their honeymoon. My spouse wasn‚Äôt invited to the wedding btw! 

My main concern is what happens when the pwBPD really realises that they are never going to be a priority in my spouse‚Äôs life. What happens when my spouse can no longer or no longer wants to carry on taking in the same way. I‚Äôm concerned for my my spouses emotional wellbeing. I feel like they are being taken advantage of a low key manipulated.  And I fear that the analogy of the frog in the boiling water may end up applying ! We also have a young child to who the pwBPD has offered to babysit on more than  one occasion. Which I am not keen on due to not knowing the person with pwBPD and our child not knowing them. 

Anyway my questions are does anyone else think this does sound like a BPD FP relationship? And is there a world in which this doesn‚Äôt end up with people getting hurt? Is my spouse being very naive thinking they‚Äôve just got this nice new friendship? 
Any opinions and advice greatly welcome! I have no one to talk to about this! ",1,1746557578.0,BPDlovedones,0,0.99,False

I mentioned it in a comment the other day, and someone said they were interested in it, so I'm writing this post about it. It's a long one ‚Äî hope you enjoy!

I was a Swiftie for a long time (I've reformed now), one of those parasocial Swifties who were obsessed with her music and her love life ‚Äî I know, I know ‚Äî so I started to get the idea that Taylor had a different vision for her life, which is very different from how things turned out. She wanted to be a power couple with Matty Healy and had planned to involve him in TTPD as a co-writer/producer. This would have branded them as an intellectual power couple, and everyone would have lost their minds over their cosmic connection. However, her fanbase didn't let it happen. Let me explain. 

We know that she and Joe broke up, and then she moved on to Matty. Some might argue that she was emotionally cheating on Joe with Matty for months before the breakup. At this point, she controlled the narrative: the whole world wanted to know what had happened between her and Joe, and was interested in her new man. Fans screamed and begged her to release a new album so they could find out everything, so she released 'You Are Losing Me' to give everyone a little taste of it, and the Swifties went feral and turned on Joe for making her sad and not marrying her. 

By this time, she was obsessed with Matty, tired of hiding in the basement, so they went public and were photographed in NYC. She was head over heels and 'the happiest she had ever been'. Matty is a musician and Taylor saw an opportunity to do what she couldn't do with Joe: be a power couple, brand themselves as the writers of this generation and gain exposure and 'lore', making their relationship seem aspirational. To achieve this, she slowly started to tease him in her work.

1**. Exhibit A.** She collaborated with The 1975 (Matty's band) on 1989 TV. The original version of 'Slut' featured them, and Matty was credited for the lyrics. This song was removed from the tracklist at the last minute due to the controversies (which we'll discuss later), but it made it to the album booklets, and some Swifties received the 'old version' of the tracklist with the song's lyrics and credits. There are lots of pictures of this online from different sources, so I doubt it's fake.

2. **Exhibit B.** She kind of referenced him in the 'Karma' remix music video. We all know he was involved in a controversy with Ice Spice, and shortly afterwards Taylor collaborated with her, which I thought was a strange move. People started wondering if she did it to control the damage caused by the Matty/Ice Spice situation. But that doesn't matter: the important thing is that she referenced Matty in the video. It ends with her carrying a cup of coffee and bringing it to a tall man with black, messy hair who is sitting by the piano playing it while she sings, 'Karma is my boyfriend'. The image then blurs, but you can still see his silhouette and it clearly resembles Matty. I was surprised at first because she always referenced her boyfriends as her inspiration while she was the musician, but now she's bringing a drink to a lover who's clearly a musician, which is a reversal of the usual dynamic. Kinda interesting.

**3. Exhibit C.** The title of the TTPD album. To me, it was strange that it's titled The Tortured Poet**s** Department, yet the only 'tortured poet' she talks about is herself. This could be attributed to a lazy concept where she simply created a word salad and was pleased with the result. However, personally, I don't think so. Look at the lyrics, 'You left your typewriter at my apartment, straight from the Tortured Poets Department', from the TTPD song. It's the only one in the whole 31-track album where she mentions the concept, and it refers to Matty. Initially, she wanted to be the only member of the Tortured Poets Department alongside Matty.

**4. Exhbit D.** The Fortnight music video. This image is pretty self-explanatory, but yeah, she draws a lot of inspiration from the aesthetic of the last 1975 album. Of course, this is because the album is about Matty. However, it could also be a nod to the fact that she was planning to involve him in the album, but failed, so ended up doing it the only way she could. Some fans also say that this song's production style is very similar to that of The 1975.

**5. Exhibit E.** The song 'The Alchemy'. I wrote a long post about how I think Taylor wrote it about Matty, but then they broke up and she tried to change it to fit Travis in, but failed. I can't link to it here since it was originally posted on another sub, but you can see it in my post history. Anyway, I think this is an example of how the songs about Matty (which he co-wrote with her) could have turned out. Epic love, inevitable attraction ‚Äî you name it!

Taylor was ready to co-write the greatest album of the century with her lover, proving that they were intellectual, creative and artistic, and that they would be the next Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. She had introduced him to her fans, and she had criticised Joe enough (the infamous unfollowing party, the YLM song), so of course everyone would accept Matty as the new perfect boyfriend. Their fanbases would have loved them, lost their minds over their epic love, and they would have been very public about it. They would have written songs about how much they love each other, talked about each other in interviews, and become this iconic couple. But then the Swifties got in the way.

I don't know if they launched their relationship too soon after Joe's breakup, or if it was just bad luck, but Swifties quickly started looking for reasons to hate and cancel Matty. He has always been a controversial public figure, but they didn't have a problem with him during their decade-long friendship, when Taylor appeared at one of his concerts in January 2025, when he promoted Midnights on social media, or in 2014 when they wore each other's merchandise and socialised in public. The fact is, they cried out for Daddy Joe and cancelled Matty, using his controversies as an excuse (some of the criticism was valid, but it got out of control and got really weird).

Then he started receiving death threats and was harassed. He realised what he was getting himself into and wanted out. He ghosted her and fled, leaving her heartbroken and wrecking her plans. She's manic and depressed, feeling like she lost the love of her life twice. She wrote about it, rebranding TTPD as a sad, cathartic album, but kept the title and aesthetic despite them being weird and uncohesive with the songs and content. While making the album, she met Travis. She sees an opportunity to become part of the iconic couple she had always dreamed of being with Matty ‚Äî this time, not as a poet, but as an all-American girl and a WAG. She sees the money and exposure that could come with it and seizes the opportunity. The rest is history.

We talked of all the years we had, all the memories, good and bad. Its hard to believe after all these years you're graduating. All the late nights of my trying to help you study, all the nights of you in virtual classes while i creep silently around trying not to disturb you. Making dinner, taking care of the house.

You said you miss me, and i said i miss you too.

""Its been.. really really... hard without you."" i said. ""I always thought i would be there with you for this part, and now, your family hates me, they don't respond when i text. They act like I'm just the worst person. Like i wasn't here for all of this, like i tried to hurt you on purpose..."". My eyes started to well up with tears.

""Hey, hey, stop that"" she said. "" You are here, with me right now. I got 13 people from out of town at my house here to celebrate, but I'm at this shitty coffee spot with you. But lets be honest, you left. You packed up and left. I wanted you to stay, but you left.""

""I was spiraling, my ship was sinking. And i didn't want you to go down too."" I said, "" there was alot of stuff i wasn't dealing with. I broke under the weight of it all. A childhood of problems, abuse, neglect. For so long i was just surviving, until i met you. Then life got hard, and i went back into survival mode.""

""Why didn't you talk to me about it?"" she asked.

""You where in a masters program, the last thing you needed was me being all broken up over something from years ago."" I took a deep breathe, "" I'm selfish, I couldn't see past my own thoughts. I don't want to taint you with my problems""

""Well that's stupid"" she said in a lighter tone, "" why do you think i wasn't there for you? You could've talked to me. I know where you came from, and I know where you are now. I've bailed you out of jail, I've sat with you in the hospital when you broke your back, I've done so much. But you can't talk to me?"" She said.

""I don't know. I wasn't myself."" I said, "" But I've started getting help since then, like real help. Not just getting fucked up, but actually dealing with those problems.""

""Yeah?"" she said.

""Yeah. Therapy is a bitch, but i think its helping. I'm trying to get better for..."" I stammered off, stopping myself.

""For?"" She said optimistically.

""You, I'm trying to get better for you."" i said as i stared right into her eyes. "" I think if can get right, you'll take me back"" i continued to stare.

The tone changed, ""The therapy needs to be for you. You need to fix yourself for you. Not me. I love you, but you need to be better for you."" She said firmly. ""You need to forgive yourself"".

The tears welled up again, i fight them back, "" I just really miss you, and this distance is breaking me, i made this huge mistake. You're about to be on the other side of the country, and ill be here doing the same shit over and over. I can't lose you anymore than i already have.""

""Well, we have been hanging out like everyday since we broke up. I mean, we broke up 5 months ago and there's been what, 10 days, where we didn't see each other since then?"" she said. "" Don't be dumb"" She said with a smile in her eyes.

My heart fluttered, ""I'm sorry, i just..."" i fumbled my words, "" I just thought when you made a hinge it was over. I saw that as my sign to back off. Yeah we hang out, but it feels different.""

She starred into my soul, "" i was just angry, you left. My friends made it for me, and it boosted my confidence seeing all those boys blowing me up.""

Cautiously i asked, "" did you like any of them? I know you said you had engineers, doctors, surgeons, wealthy dudes and all that messaging you. What happened to that?""

""I did have all those guys reaching out, promising the world. A ton of very enticing offers. Trips to Rome, trips to wherever. I'm a hot piece of ass"" She said proudly. ""But.. every time i was supposed to go out with one, i couldn't do it. I guess I'm a serial ghoster"" she said with what sounded like shame.

""Wow"" I said sarcastically, "" and here you sit with a roofer for coffee?""

""Those boys don't know me."" She said firmly, ""I mean a 6 pack would be nice but looks and money aren't everything.""

""You're my everything"" I said softly. Then with a burst of confidence i said ""And I want you back"".

""Well this is a good start."" She said sweetly.

I smiled, she smiled. And we starred at each other for a while.

I have been a lurker on here but never had the guts to express a few of my dilemmas. I figured I would start here. Sigh. I am an independent contractor and I have worked in a field that I think most people don't even know exists anymore. Through this job I have gotten to interact with probably thousands of people and it has been eye opening, enlightening even. I have made friendships in unlikely ways and grown to care for my clients but typically in a platonic sort of way. I have worked in this field for about 8 years and many clients come and go, but one client didn't go. At least not for a while. When we first started speaking, he utilized me for the job I was meant to do, but we would then get into long philosophical discussions about life and death, the nature of humanity and other meaningful things. When we first spoke he was living in the US, but over time I was on the phone with him through various transitions. I was who he called when he wanted to pursue women and needed advice. I was there when he succeeded or failed. Even when he succeeded THEN failed. I listened to him picking himself apart for his failures and doubting the credibility of his successes. When the economy started tanking, I was there when he moved to Germany and he still called. We never spoke less than an hour. He was as reliable as my morning cup of coffee. As years went by, we both knew a lot about one another, but I believe he started falling first. I was continuing to try and remain professional even though he had passed into my heart as a friend long ago. But there was another issue. My job itself. The fact that he needed to use my skills made him feel disgusted with himself even though he had done absolutely nothing wrong. He was respectful, kind, human. I tried to reassure him I had dealt with much more disrespectful clients and that he was one of my favorites. Aside from feeling like he was using me and wasting my time, he admitted his attachment to me was akin to an addiction and that he needed to pull back and focus on his life. I was sad to see him go but ultimately wanted what was best for him. We were painfully aware that we would likely never meet. There were those conversations about it where the hope arose in his voice. I could almost sense him glancing at me from the corner of his eyes, fingers crossed. He would then punctuate that conversation with laughter just to make sure neither of us were let down by reality. To act like we didnt care. And so he did disappear. For almost a year and a half he was gone. I wondered what he was doing and how he felt. I'd built new relationships with clients, even new friendships but he was just, different. He felt like a person who was born in the wrong era. He struggled with the reality we had to live through but remained so authentic and thoughtful about it all. As time went on I tucked him into my pocket and focused on my work even though he would randomly come to mind every now and again. So my birthday arose. I was a little irritated that I was working but it was my choice. (In this economy was it though?) I had maybe been working for two hours and I was getting through it as best I could. The next time my phone rang, it was him! This completely stunned me because I underestimated my value in his eyes. He remembered my flipping birthday??? What on Earth?? He talked for 2 hours about how hard it was to keep away. That he would often check my availability and then turn away from his phone. He updated me on his life. We talked about the Nordstream Pipeline, which was so strange to know someone who was experiencing this from the other side. We philosophized as usual like no time had passed when he absentmindedly mentioned he loved me. Well I couldn't say it back even if I felt it, because I'm married...And he knew. I love my husband deeply, I'd never cheat or hurt him but I even told him about this. He is very understanding (we were open for a while). It came to the point where it was just devastating to get calls from the guy because I kept imagining this alternate universe where there are endless copies of me with plenty of love to share. He hasnt called in over a year. A little part of me hopes he calls on my birthday. Another part hopes he never calls again. Should I have told him I loved him, made that clear? I think with a job like mine, people think we dont ""really"" care about the customers. I have cried with them, laughed, genuinely loved people I never met and never plan to. They just provided company and I provide a place they can be brutally honest and maybe even depraved without my judgment. He thought he was so depraved but he wasn't even close.

We were just randomly mandated a return to office requirement last week effective in July and I am somewhat excited about it. I graduated from college in 2015 and had swapped offices with this company 3 times in NYC so I have 5-6 years worth of in-office experience.

The people I met, the places I went for lunch or dinner & drinks after work, the things I saw (solar eclipse in central park w/ coworkers), the small interactions w/ the coffee shop employees and workers or the people with their doggo's waiting in line for coffee. The feeling of coming into the office hungover after staying out late with coworkers or coming into the office after a really long late night deployment sucked, but it was what we used to jokingly call ""friendship through shared suffering"". Being the ""regulars"" at restaurants/bars and chatting with the owners etc.

When you would have meetings, people would actually pay attention instead of staying on mute, no camera on working on something completely non-related to the meeting. Walking over to a different department to ask a question instead of waiting for someone to reply to a message or email after a whole day, leaving you on read. Rolling your chair over and pair-programming / debugging next to each other taught you shortcuts for applications you both use because you watch the person using the computer, not just their screen.

Sure, its a 2 hour round trip commute for me and in the past we had the flexibility to work remote if need be on a pretty open policy. Sure, I'm single and childless w/o a dog/cat etc. so responsibility is low at the moment. I understand people with SO's or children have completely different schedules they need to deal with and childcare is expensive. They want to spend more time together, understandably.

However.... if we all just shelter inside and shun away these interactions, as much as people say it doesn't happen, we lose a sense of community and comradery. We become excessively self-centered (not everyone, just saw this in myself and others).

As we come from the same state, we exchanged contact numbers. After some days, I asked a couple of times for a coffee. She consistently postponed. One day, I asked her about the class timings, and she asked me to join the library with her (only for a day, I think). On that day we talked; I asked for a lunch, and she agreed. We went for lunch and came to the library. A day later, she asked me to visit the Iskcon temple with her. I really like her, so I want to spend time with her. We did visit the temple(2 days ago); we had a good time together. On that day she told me everything about her. How she changed from a party/cool girl to spiritual and introverted. (Some incidents have happened with her).She told me about her ex as well. Her ex is from the same campus. She said she still loves him. First, she gave the reason that they have no future together, so they are not talking other. Now she said today they have some ego issues as well. Today we visited the old Delhi Chandni Chowk for her sister's bride dress. I went with her because I want to be with her. Nevertheless, she again told me about her ex and said she will love him forever; she won't forget him. And they are still talking to each other (less talk as per her).Now I want to know about your opinion regarding this situation.I like her. But I don't know what's on her mind. She said I'm her good friend and our vibes are the same.

Today, when we visited the market , I just got disappointed for some reason.Like she is not paying attention. She is not even sitting with me on the metro (when sir was not taken). I felt sad and disappointed.

Shall I tell her what I'm feeling for her?

Or just give her some time to know her better.Now I'm feeling broken.

1kgcblo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlowBurnHorror/comments/1kgcblo/the_forrest_that_grew_in_my_apartment/,The Forrest That Grew in my Apartment,"The morning felt wrong, but not in a dramatic way. Just‚Ä¶ off.

I woke to the soft hum of my old box fan and an odd, sour yellow light leaking through the blinds. I checked my phone‚Äî7:42 a.m.‚Äîbut the alarm hadn‚Äôt gone off. No notifications. No updates. Just that hollow, quiet screen.

The apartment felt heavier than usual. Still air. Dry mouth. Static in my hair. I chalked it up to a poor night‚Äôs sleep and shuffled toward the kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the first one.

A sprout‚Äîno taller than my pinky‚Äîhad pushed up from a crack in the floorboard. Bright green. Soft-edged. The kind of thing you‚Äôd see in a time-lapse documentary. I stared, bleary-eyed.

Maybe a seed dropped through a vent. Maybe something left behind by the last tenant. I plucked it out, tossed it in the trash, and forgot about it by the time the coffee finished brewing.

‚∏ª

I forgot about the sprout. Days have been bleeding together lately, and it didn‚Äôt seem worth remembering.

But the next morning, it was back.

Same corner. Same crack. This time, with company‚Äîtwo more little shoots, thin and curled, like fingers reaching for the heater. I crouched down. The floor felt soft underfoot. Not wet. Just‚Ä¶ loose.

I yanked the sprouts out again, more annoyed than anything. I meant to clean. I didn‚Äôt.

That night, the kitchen lights flickered. Barely perceptible, but there‚Äîa soft twitch, like an eyelid about to blink. The light was dimmer than usual. That same pale yellow haze.

I made a mental note to check the breaker and didn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

Next morning, the sprouts had grown.

A vine trailed along the baseboard, curling toward the fridge. A single leaf had unfurled.

I hesitated. Got down on my knees and touched it. Cool. Damp. A little fuzzy, like moss. I tugged. It resisted. I pulled harder. It tore with a sound I didn‚Äôt like.

I threw it away. Again.

‚∏ª

Later, brushing my teeth, I noticed something else.

The mirror was fogged‚Äînot from steam, but like the inside of a windshield. I wiped it. It smeared. Left a faint greenish streak on my towel.

No open windows. No leaks.

That night, I heard buzzing. A fly looping around the hallway light. I hadn‚Äôt opened a window in weeks.

‚∏ª

The floor‚Äôs definitely off now. Slight give, like packed earth under a blanket. My socks came away damp. I peeled up the corner of the carpet.

Dark. Moist. No mold. No subfloor. Just soft soil and tiny white roots.

I should‚Äôve been alarmed.

I wasn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

More sprouts. More vines. Now curling around the fridge and creeping through the cabinets. Moss growing in the shower tiles. Something leafy sprouting in the back of the fridge‚Äîlike ferns.

I cleaned it. Scrubbed. Bleached everything.

The next day, it came back worse.

‚∏ª

It‚Äôs been a week. Maybe two.

My phone still turns on. Still charges. I can scroll through old messages. But no calls go through. Just endless ringing. No voicemails. No responses.

I tried texting:
‚ÄúHey, you ever seen moss grow in a fridge?‚Äù
‚ÄúWanna come over? Something weird‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

No replies. No read receipts.

‚∏ª

I walked down the hall to knock on my neighbor‚Äôs door.

The hallway stretched longer than it should‚Äôve. The lights above buzzed and blinked like dying insects. I never reached her door. The hallway narrowed. Folded in on itself.

I turned around.

‚∏ª

The smell doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. Damp soil. Cut grass.

Moss crawls up the bathroom walls like wallpaper in reverse. Ferns grow from the soap dish. I tried scrubbing again, but the sponge disintegrated in my hand.

Two nights ago, a bird nested in the bathroom vent. Just stared at me. Perfectly still.

I didn‚Äôt bother it. It didn‚Äôt bother me.

‚∏ª

The fridge hums like it‚Äôs alive.

Milk sours in a day. Mushrooms bloom in the drawers‚Äîpale, fat, open like mouths. I throw them out. They return.

I‚Äôve stopped cleaning.

The vines always come back. Stronger. Faster.

I step over thick roots like they belong. I sit at my desk and pretend I still live in an apartment.

‚∏ª

This morning, a leaf on my pillow. Long. Wet with dew. I flushed it, but it twirled in the water like it didn‚Äôt want to leave.

I think the forest is learning the shape of me.

The clocks tick, but never agree. Microwave: 3:09. Stove: 11:52. Phone: ‚ÄúSearching‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚∏ª

Outside the windows: no street. No buildings. Just forest. Towering trees. Glass fogs up if I look too long. Sometimes I see movement. Shapes between trunks.

Light changes without warning. Morning bleeds into dusk.

Lamps flicker even when unplugged.

‚∏ª

Last night: voices.

Not loud‚Äîwhispers through wood. Chanting. Maybe my name.

When I woke up‚Äîif I slept‚Äîthere was a second door.

Identical to my front door. But black. No knob. Just a keyhole.

I didn‚Äôt touch it.

‚∏ª

Mushrooms again. A perfect circle on the living room carpet. I stepped around them.

The bird in the vent chirped when I spoke. When I laughed, it mimicked the sound.

‚∏ª

I opened the second door.

No hallway. No stairwell.

A classroom. My desk. A projector flickering. A younger me, pushing a crying boy I used to bully.

I tried to scream. My throat was moss.

When I shut the door, my walls were wet.

‚∏ª

There‚Äôs no ceiling now. Just branches. Tall. Ancient. Swaying slowly, like underwater trees. Sometimes stars beyond them. Sometimes eyes.

The door never closed again. It stays ajar. Sometimes I hear footsteps behind it. Small. Familiar.

My shelves collapsed under vines. My bed is gone.

I sleep on a patch of moss that hums when I lie still.

‚∏ª

This morning: a circle of stones around my body.

My hands folded over my chest. Fingernails packed with dirt.

I didn‚Äôt do that.

At least‚ÄîI don‚Äôt remember doing it.

‚∏ª

Today, something in the window.

Not through it. In it.

My reflection didn‚Äôt move. It stared back‚Äîcalm, still. Leaves grew from its shoulders. Bark traced its jawline.

Its mouth didn‚Äôt move, but I heard something:

‚ÄúYou were already here.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The vines are inside me now. I feel them in my ribs.

I cough up spores. The bird is gone. But wings still flap behind the walls.

I think the forest is done waiting.

‚∏ª

I don‚Äôt remember typing this.

Or maybe I always was.

Maybe this isn‚Äôt posting. Maybe you‚Äôre not real.

But if you‚Äôre reading this, I need you to understand:

I didn‚Äôt ask for this.

I didn‚Äôt go outside. I didn‚Äôt touch anything. I just‚Ä¶ slept.

And something grew in my apartment.

Until it wasn‚Äôt an apartment anymore.

Until there was only green. And silence.
And the sound of something very old saying my name like it was part of a root system.

‚∏ª

If this ever happens to you:
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt open the second door.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt touch the leaves.
	‚Ä¢	Never lie down with your eyes closed.

You might not wake up the same.

Or at all.

1kgcb91,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kgcb91/aitah_for_telling_my_boyfriends_sister_if_she/,AITAH for telling my boyfriend‚Äôs sister if she keeps having extreme reactions to minor change then there‚Äôs a bigger problem in her than just finding adjusting difficult?,"I‚Äôve only been dating my boyfriend a couple of months and he told me his sister struggles with change. I thought he meant with big scale stuff which would kinda make sense but no she has blown her top over the least fucking thing ever since I‚Äôve known her.  If something minor happens especially even minor inconveniences she either cries, freaks out or almost has full blown panic attacks but does absolutely nothing to help her situation.

One time we met her for coffee after work and she freaked out because I tied my hair back with my fringe into the bun rather than having my fringe down the side and she didn‚Äôt like it as I looked different. I straightened my hair another time when she was used to seeing me with my curly hair even though I looked the fucking same. I put my stretchers back in my ears and she didn‚Äôt like it as it was a ‚Äòhuge adjustment‚Äô when in reality it‚Äôs not at all. I have told both my boyfriend and his sister she is freaking out over the least thing and that I don‚Äôt look any different whether my hair has been styled differently or if I put stretchers back in and that reactions like that aren‚Äôt normal.

I have tried to be understanding but it is testing my patience because it is not normal to freak out over stuff like this. People do stuff with their hair all the time. She also never provides a legitimate reason for her freak outs or even attempts to better herself despite my boyfriend insisting she is trying, always saying she finds adjustment difficult. Again, she point blank refuses to acknowledge there could be something deeper going on with her that she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about or deal with.

The final straw was when she freaked out because I changed my septum ring. She was used to seeing me wear a horse shoe ring but I was sick of the balls falling off the end so I changed to a clicker ring so it will stay in place. When she noticed the ring change, she actually started panicking and almost hyperventilating stating she ‚Äòcannot deal‚Äô as it‚Äôs a ‚Äòmajor alteration to my face.‚Äô I‚Äôll admit I lost my cool and told her if she has extreme reactions to the most minor of things there is something more to it than her just finding adjustment difficult and it is a serious problem she needs to get help for. I even said I‚Äôm bad with anxiety sometimes and it could be that which would explain a lot and instead she said I was ‚Äòvictimising her for something I can‚Äôt control‚Äô and she ended up going off in a strop and I chose to go home.

This whole situation is unbelievably stupid but I thought what I said was perfectly valid because I have in the past had a tendency to overthink and overreact to minor things when I had deeper issues going on inside and if she doesn‚Äôt seek help which she clearly needs it‚Äôs not going to help her. I told this to my boyfriend as I thought this was rational and he thinks I should apologise to his sister to keep the peace and not talk about any potential help for mental health issues because it will upset her. I disagree and think if she overreacts to everything there‚Äôs something deeper going on and that I wasn‚Äôt intentionally being an AH and that burying his head in the sand will just make it worse for her.

ETA: I‚Äôm 27, my boyfriend is 29 and his sister is 25.

When I say lose my cool, I meant I didn‚Äôt shout or anything. I was pissed off but said it as calmly as I could whilst also highlighting how irritated I am.

I also have a long history of anxiety, depression, self harm and suicide attempts so I understand what it‚Äôs like to overreact to minor things as I was like that but letting it dictate your life and refusing to get any help only worsens things. Sometimes blunt honesty is the only way to go and I tried to deliver it as bluntly as I could without coming across as aggressive as I am well aware she could have underlying mental health conditions and I also know what it‚Äôs like to be in denial and deep in mental illness so it‚Äôs hard to admit you may need help. I have been bullied relentlessly and shamed for having depression so you learn to have empathy for others potentially in your situation as I don‚Äôt want anyone to go through what I went through.",16,1746557170.0,AITAH,28,0.84,False

I'd scroll on my phone until 1am, then wonder why mornings felt like torture. When people talked about ""being a morning person,"" I genuinely thought they were lying or just wired differently.

But 4 months ago, something shifted. Now I wake up at 5am¬†*voluntarily*‚Äîand weirdly, with actual anticipation. Not because I suddenly developed superhuman discipline, but because I accidentally discovered what actually makes early mornings worth it.

# The failed approaches

First, let me clarify what¬†*didn't*¬†work:

* Putting my alarm across the room (I'd get up, turn it off, and crawl back into bed)
* Going to bed earlier without changing anything else (just led to lying awake for hours)
* Using guilt as motivation (""successful people wake up early!"")
* Coffee rewards (I'd hit snooze thinking ""I can still have coffee at 8am"")

# The accidental discovery

The change happened when my college friend Sam visited for a week. He's been a 5am riser for years, and I agreed to join him for his morning routine just to be polite. He brought this ridiculous tradition‚Äîwe'd meet in the kitchen at 5:15, make coffee, and then sit on my tiny apartment balcony watching the sunrise while sharing one thing we were looking forward to that day.

I expected to hate it. But something strange happened on day three‚ÄîI found myself actually¬†*excited*¬†to get up. There was something magical about having that peaceful hour before the world started demanding things from me. The quiet streets, the changing colors in the sky, and most importantly, starting the day with anticipation rather than dread.

When Sam left, I didn't want to lose this newfound morning magic. He suggested we stay connected through this habit tracking [tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fistbump-habits-with-friends/id6742868057) he uses with his friends. Every morning, I snap a quick photo of my sunrise view. If I don't check in by 6am, my friends can send little nudges that ping my phone until I get moving. There's something about knowing three other people can see whether I've kept my commitment that gets me out of bed even on the toughest mornings.

# What changed everything

Here's what makes this sustainable when nothing else worked:

1. **Social connection**: Those morning check-ins have become sacred. Seeing my friends' sunrise photos from different cities creates this weird bond‚Äîwe're all witnessing the start of the day together, even from hundreds of miles apart. When someone doesn't post, we all notice.
2. **Starting with anticipation**: Forcing myself to articulate something I'm looking forward to‚Äîeven something small like ""trying that new coffee shop"" or ""finishing that book""‚Äîcompletely reframes the day from obligation to opportunity.
3. **The early morning calm**: There's a stillness at 5am that doesn't exist at any other time. No emails, no notifications, no expectations. Just space to breathe and think clearly. It's become precious time that I'm protective of.
4. **Productive before pressure**: By 8am when work officially starts, I've already exercised, planned my day, and worked on a personal project. The psychological advantage of being ahead before others have even started is surprisingly powerful.

The most unexpected benefit has been the ripple effect on the rest of my life. With consistent sleep patterns, my energy levels have stabilized. I'm more patient with colleagues and family. I finish work earlier because I start with clarity rather than catching up. And weirdest of all‚ÄîI actually look forward to bedtime at 9:30pm, because I'm genuinely excited for the next morning.

This isn't about torturing yourself to follow some hustle culture ideal. It's about creating a morning worth waking up for. Find your people, create your ritual, and discover what makes early mornings meaningful to YOU specifically. The discipline follows naturally when the reward is real.

Anyone else accidentally discover what makes early mornings actually enjoyable rather than just endurable?",113,1746556964.0,getdisciplined,10,0.87,False

Entry 1 

I have no idea what's going on right now and im scared



When I woke up yesterday, something felt off. It's not even that it felt off, it smelled wrong; like someone had used a power saw to chop up wood in my room. I slipped on some flannel pyjama pants and a day-old shirt I found on the floor and headed downstairs.

 Usually on a sunday morning my mom would be in the kitchen frying up bacon while scrambling eggs muttering to herself about how something always burns. Instead my mom was sitting at the kitchen table completely motionless, her hands wrapped around her coffee cup. I could tell the cup was still warm from the steam wafting out of the mug. Then my heart sank. She wasn‚Äôt breathing, She wasn‚Äôt blinking, She was as still as a murder victim in a horror flick.

Her eyes were like glass orbs. I mean that literally, Reflective, rounded, and just slightly too large for her face. Her skin looked smooth at first‚Äîalmost too smooth‚Äîuntil I got closer and realized it wasn‚Äôt skin at all. It was wood. Pale, polished wood with tiny carved lines where her mouth should be. Her nose was a perfect triangle. Like something you'd see on a marionette in a creepy puppet theater, not on your mother.

I called her name. I shook her. I screamed. Nothing. Her head flopped over a little when I grabbed her shoulders; like a doll weighted wrong. I thought maybe it was just her. A stroke? A seizure? A delusion? So I ran outside. That‚Äôs when I saw Mr. Jeffers, our neighbor, standing on his porch in a baby blue bathrobe and bright pink slippers. Just standing. Not moving. Not breathing. His mouth was frozen in a permanent smile, carved deep and wide into his wooden face. A bluebird landed on his shoulder and pecked at his cheek and he didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt even twitch.

Everyone on the street was like that. My neighbours sat completely still in cars that were still running in their driveways. A lawn mower sat abandoned mid-lap across someone‚Äôs yard while its owner was lying flat in the grass. A mail carrier frozen mid-step with one leg in the air. I think I screamed, then fell over before scurrying back inside like a scared bunny rabbit. That day was a blur, I tried to call an ambulance, nobody picked up. I biked to other neighbourhoods looking for someone, anyone who would help. It was the same story no matter where I went. So I went back home.

I stayed inside for hours, waiting for someone to knock, to say it was a prank, a chemical leak, a dream. But no one did. I found myself eating an entire box of cereal. Then I puked it up. Not because it was bad. Just because I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

It‚Äôs the next morning now. Or the morning after that. I haven‚Äôt slept. I don‚Äôt think I can. Everyone is still there. All of them. Not dead. Just... paused. Or puppets. I don‚Äôt know what to call them. But it‚Äôs like the world stopped moving without me; and I‚Äôm the only one who didn‚Äôt get turned off. 

Please, If you're reading this, tell me I‚Äôm not the only one.


Entry 2

I think they're moving but I really can't be sure as of right now 

I don't think I imagined it. I thought maybe I was sleep-deprived, possibly Hallucinating. But I swear, I saw the mailman tilt his head yesterday. Just a little. Just enough to peer over at my house. I froze when I saw it. For a second, I doubted it moved. But then he blinked.

Then this morning, I noticed Mr. Jefferson wasn't on the porch anymore.They‚Äôre moving. Not all at once. Not like a switch flipped. But gradually‚Äîjerkily‚Äîlike marionettes remembering they have strings again.

My mom is in a different position now. It's not like she's in a different room or anything, she‚Äôs still at the kitchen table, but her coffee cup is tipped over, and her hand is on the tablecloth like she was reaching for something to dry the coffee with. I know I didn't move it. I didn‚Äôt touch anything.

At first I thought maybe I knocked it over when I was shaking her the other day. But I know I didn't knock it over then. Whatever happened I still needed to clean up the spill. As I went upstairs to grab a towel I nearly had a heart attack. My sister, or her puppet ( I don't know what to call them) was standing in the doorway of her room. I had actually forgotten about her; being wrapped up in whatever was going on around here, but now she‚Äôs upright. Silent. Her painted eyes staring at me, wide, wrong, and grinning.

I rushed over and slammed her door shut and shoved a chair from my room up under the door knob. Not because I thought it would help. But because I needed to do something.
Something‚Äôs happening. Something‚Äôs waking them up. And then‚Ä¶ just now‚Ä¶ I got an email notification. I popped open my laptop, it sprung to life, surprisingly still connected to Wi-Fi Somehow. I pulled up the new email hoping someone had seen my post from earlier. But the website was wrong everywhere it should have read Gmail it now read Gtree., i scrolled down to the new treemail i guess 

The sender read mariennettNewsNetwork@gtree.com. No subject. Just a single file: ""welcome_back.mp4""
I clicked it.

First came the sound ‚Äî a warped xylophone jingle, all wrong in tone and timing, like a corrupted children‚Äôs show theme run through a rusted music box. The screen glitched, then bloomed into a burst of red and yellow so bright it hurt to look at. The colors pulsed, oversaturated and feverish.
Then the ‚Äúnews anchor‚Äù appeared.
It was a wooden puppet in a stiff, child‚Äôs parody of a suit and tie, sitting behind a desk that looked like it had been cobbled together from toy blocks. Its mouth opened and closed with a loose, clacking rhythm, always a split-second out of sync with the voice‚Äîan eerily cheerful, robotic tone that sounded like a kindergarten teacher trapped in a loop.
‚ÄúGood morning, happy citizens!‚Äù the voice chirped.
 ‚ÄúWelcome to a bright new era!‚Äù
Above the puppet‚Äôs head, a banner read: PUPPET REALITY DAILY.
The camera angle didn‚Äôt shift. The puppet didn‚Äôt blink. It simply stared, smiling, as the voice continued.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs top story: Reintegration Day is underway!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat does that mean for you and your fellow citizens? It means joy, purpose, and glorious synchronization!‚Äù
There was a burst of static, and the puppet‚Äôs head jerked hard to the left. A beat of silence. Then it snapped back into place as if nothing had happened.
‚ÄúAny individuals experiencing confusion, dissonance, or persistent ‚Äòhuman residue‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî and here the voice took on an odd, singsong lilt ‚Äî ‚Äúshould report to their nearest Harmonization Center immediately.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour compliance ensures a smooth and splinter-free future!‚Äù
Behind the puppet, a looping animation played: a cartoon family of wooden figures holding hands in front of a house. The same house I grew up in, maybe. The loop repeated again and again‚Äîuntil, for just a fraction of a second, one of the family members glitched. Its face contorted in a silent scream, mouth stretched too wide, eyes black and bulging.
Then it snapped back to smiling like the rest.
The puppet anchor‚Äôs voice rose one final time.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our daily pledge!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI am wood.
 I am one.
 I am willing.‚Äù
The jingle swelled again, more distorted now. The puppet grinned wider, impossibly wide.
Then the screen froze mid-note.
And cut to black.

The Wi-Fi is still running. Electricity too.  Something‚Äôs keeping the world alive‚Äîeven if it isn‚Äôt us anymore.

They‚Äôre broadcasting now. Talking to each other. Or to me.I doubt they were ever just frozen. I think they were watching. And now they‚Äôre ready.

Entry 3

I dont think it's safe here anymore. 

 After I saw that news clip on treemail I decided to make a run for it. I wasn't going to stay put anymore, I'll find someone, I know I will. At first, I thought I was dreaming. Now I know I'm not.

 This morning I found myself waking up with the sun directly overhead; I was inside a dense bush I saw in someone's yard. The sleep wasn't the best i've ever had but in my sleep-deprived state it felt heavenly. After putting my blanket back in the backpack I was using as a makeshift pillow, I crawled out from my little shrubby safe haven. 

I walked down Oak Avenue and saw Mr. Delaney, my old school bus driver. But his head was too round. His skin too smooth. And his hands made a hard clack-clack sound as they gripped the steering wheel. Just like always‚Äîsame navy jacket, same coffee-stained Yankees cap. He pulled the bus up to the curb. It had to be somewhere around noon; I found myself pretty confused as to why he was out and about with the school bus. There were no kids. No sound. Just him. Sitting there. Waiting for children who weren‚Äôt coming.

I hid behind a tree and watched. After exactly five minutes, he closed the bus doors, then he drove up the curb, slamming the front of the bus into a mailbox before he unremorsefully made the most illegal U-turn I'd ever seen in my life. Then he drove off in silence, it was like muscle memory from a life he didn't know was gone.

Further down, I saw a jogger still in a nightgown, someone I think used to be Ms. Nguyen from whatever real estate agency that kept on trying to buy the house off my mom. Her wooden knees were pumping stiffly, arms swinging too high. Her mouth was painted into a smile that never moved. When she passed me, I swear she turned her head just a little. Not all the way. Just enough to let me know she saw me. She didn‚Äôt stop running. Everything feels like‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs been programmed, or Looped.

 The puppets have jobs, routines; they‚Äôre still doing them, even if they don‚Äôt make sense anymore. The grocery store lights were on. Music played overhead. I went in, There were no customers. However, every cashier was standing at their register. Some of them stood there unmoving, wooden eyes locked onto me like I was doing something that was taboo to them. A few cashiers scanned invisible items over and over again, the motion looping like a broken animatronic. A bagger dropped nothing into a paper sack and passed it down the conveyor belt to no one.

I backed out slowly. I didn‚Äôt want to be noticed. I don‚Äôt think they want me gone.
 But I don‚Äôt think they want me to interfere either. Something is‚Ä¶ keeping the world running. Not alive. Just moving.

I was eating a can of cold beans by flashlight in the abandoned tech section of a walmart. The tvs were still running now and all of them were showing that new news station ‚ÄúMNN‚Äù or marinnett news network.

There was no warning this time. No jingle. Just a crackle of static and a voice‚Äîbright, bubbly, and wrong.

‚ÄúAttention! Attention!
 This is your daily guidance from the Office of Orderly Living!‚Äù
The voice was sharper now. Not cheerful like the first time‚Äîmore forced. Like it was smiling with clenched teeth.
‚ÄúAll citizens must now report for weekly inspections! That‚Äôs right! Your health, your shine, and your synchronization must be evaluated for optimal performance!‚Äù

The words slithered into my ears like splinters. I could hear the capital letters.
I didn‚Äôt even need a screen to picture it anymore. I saw the puppet anchor in my mind‚Äîjaw clicking up and down, head slightly crooked. Behind it, I imagined a cartoon graphic: a puppet sitting on a tiny exam table while another scraped its joints with a file and polished its cheeks until they gleamed.
The voice shifted tone‚Äîslower, lower, like it was reading a warning label no one ever reads.
‚ÄúRot is a crime.
 Deviation is disobedience.
 Self-direction is a splintering hazard.‚Äù
There was a beat of static. And then something else crept in‚Äîa faint mechanical whine, like a saw blade spinning up in the distance.
‚ÄúRefusal to attend inspection will result in‚Ä¶ immediate repurposing.‚Äù
My skin crawled. I pictured another graphic, too vivid: limbs unscrewed and reattached in new shapes. Faces carved into benches. A puppet laughing as its own smile was nailed into place.Then, as before, the voice snapped back into cheer.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our daily pledge!‚Äù
I mouthed the words before they came‚Äîlike a spell being recited over and over until it loses all meaning:
I am wood.
I am one.
I am willing.


Entry 4 
I broke one, i didn't mean to they're just fragile 
I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting. Maybe that there was still a person in there, somewhere. Maybe I thought if I just shook one hard enough, if I pulled hard enough, they'd snap out of it. Like sleepwalking. Like a bad dream.

It happened this morning. I walked into a part of town I don‚Äôt normally go to‚Äîan older neighborhood, the kind of place that‚Äôs always felt distant,or rundown like a different world. Maybe that‚Äôs why I picked it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to see any familiar faces. I just wanted answers. I needed to know what‚Äôs left of all this.

Soon I found my target, a random cashier at Mrs. Roth‚Äôs bakery, an older looking puppet with gray curls and a permanent smile, stood behind the counter, constantly handing out bread and cookies then dropping them on the floor. She stood there performing her job except there were no customers to take the goodies. when I stepped inside, she instantly froze. The puppet stood there motionless. Still in her apron, Still smiling that same, frozen smile. Her eyes, though... there was nothing behind them. Just glass.

I stood there for a long time. Just staring at her. I don‚Äôt even know why I didn‚Äôt leave. Maybe I thought if I stayed long enough, she‚Äôd blink. Maybe if I waited, the human part of her would come back. thenI walked closer. Took one step. Then another. And then I whispered, softly; ‚Äúhello? Is anyone there?‚Äù No response.

I reached for her shoulder first, her wooden body was cold to the touch. Too cold. The way plastic feels. Or the way you imagine a mannequin might feel. I swallowed hard and grabbed her wrist instead. It was lighter than it should have been. Hollow. Like it had been emptied out, like the wood was carved thin, and the skin was only a layer over the emptiness. I don‚Äôt even think I meant to pull that hard. I thought it would be like tugging a blanket or shaking someone awake.

But when I yanked I heard a loud CRACK. Like the wrist had no more give. It was as if it wasn‚Äôt a joint anymore. Just a fragile piece of furniture. My stomach dropped, I don't know why I felt so sickened by my actions. 

Then the arm fell off, I couldn‚Äôt even catch it. It fell to the ground with a clack, rolling slightly before stopping. The woman's head tipped to the side, her smile didn't waver. Her eyes stayed wide open.

I just stood there. And I stared. Stared at her hand in mine, then the arm on the floor. I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt even cry. I just dropped the hand, turned around, And walked out of that bakery like it wasn‚Äôt real. I must have ran for miles. Through streets I didn‚Äôt recognize, just trying to get away. attempting  to get my feet to move faster and faster.

They‚Äôre not asleep. They‚Äôre not dreaming. They‚Äôre finished. They‚Äôre locked in place standing rigid, empty. Set in motion until something or someone comes around to pull their strings. And I can‚Äôt change it, I can‚Äôt fix it, I can‚Äôt even wake them up.I think I knew that deep down. But it hurts more, having tried.

Entry 5

Breaking her was a mistake 

I didn‚Äôt mean to stop, I was just passing through one of the outer neighborhoods; cookie-cutter houses that all looked the same. Like they‚Äôd been stamped out of some suburban mold, painted black and white. Nothing Seemed to have moved out here in days. The only sound was the wind rustling through the desolate trees lining the roads. 

That was it seemed that way until I heard the faint jingle of the MNN emanating from each of the houses. I could see the faint lights of a tv flashing through the curtains or blinds of each house. I wanted to know what the puppets were going to do next, so I snuck onto each porch I came across until I found one, there was a crack big enough to see the whole tv. I crept closer, staying low. Pressed myself flat against the concrete siding. The window was half-open, I could clearly see Inside, a puppet family sat in a living room frozen in perfect domestic bliss. A father-puppet on the recliner. A mother-puppet on the couch with a tea cup glued to her wooden fingers. Two smaller ones on the carpet between them, cross-legged, staring ahead with glassy, painted-on eyes. The TV was on. And that voice was back.

‚ÄúSpecial bulletin! This is a priority transmission from Puppet Reality Daily!‚Äù
The anchor-puppet on the screen looked newer than the others‚Äîsleek varnish, brighter eyes, tighter jaw hinge. Behind it, a bold red banner read:
 NON-COMPLIANT ACTIVITY DETECTED: ‚ÄúAuthorities are on high alert for an anomaly in District Seven. An unidentified non-compliant unit has tampered with a fully synchronized citizen!‚Äù
My stomach felt like it was on some kind of crazy rollercoaster, wobbling up and down left then right. I knew there was some form of communication between them. Obviously they had the news; now I know they've organized themselves beyond that. 
In my brief moment of shock I took a step back only for the floorboards under me to make a loud CREEEEK noise. I didn‚Äôt breathe. I could feel the sweat freezing on my back as I watched,half expecting the puppet children on the carpet to move, they didn't, they didn't even blink. I wondered if they even could. Or if they were just placed there, something like props on a set, arranged for the nightly performance.

‚ÄúThis act of disruption has caused irreparable damage to a loyal neighbor-unit. But don‚Äôt worry! Harmony will be restored.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe remind all citizens that tampering, resisting, or unsanctioned interaction is a punishable offense. Any ‚Äòfree expression‚Äô not aligned with group unity will be swiftly... corrected.‚Äù
‚ÄúHave you seen something strange? A unit moving against the grain? A citizen who speaks out of sync? Report all deviant behavior to your nearest Observer Drone.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd remember:
 I am wood.
 I am one.
 I am willing.‚Äù

At that moment, I became very aware of the power lines above me; of the rusted garden gnome by the gate. As well as the eerie silence all around me. I began to study the neighbourhood, I looked for anything out of place. And that's when I saw them, all of them, it didn't look like America. It looked like the system was directly imported from another country.  On each telephone pole looking in nearly every direction; dark camera bulbs embedded in the wood, one of the cameras was aimed square at the house, seemingly at me and me.	The screen on the TV froze mid-jingle,the puppet family hadn't reacted. The light flickered once, then died. Silence again. I ducked away from the window and kept moving.

They know I'm not a puppet, one of them must have reported me. Probably the one at Ms. Roth's bakery. I had a feeling the answers I wanted would come at a cost, after a few days I had come to think the punishment was my feelings of misery for breaking some-thing that used to be human; I was terribly mistaken. They were using some kind of camera system to track my movements. 

I didn't think. I didn't even contemplate my next move; I ran. I ran as hard and fast as my legs would go. There was no stopping to look back. There was no shaking the feeling they were about to start hunting me. I wanted to get as far from civilization as I could. Neighborhoods, stores, and parks aren't safe anymore. 

Entry 6

I think they know I'm still human. I'm hiding now. I don't know how much longer I have

I used to think I was invisible. In the beginning, I walked through town like a ghost. The puppet people didn‚Äôt flinch when I passed. They just stood there like statues posed in still-life scenes of old routines, clutching briefcases, watering plants. It was like I didn‚Äôt register at all.

But that‚Äôs changed. I noticed the first one three days ago; It was on Main Street, standing by the library steps. Not like the others. This one moved. It jerked its head in mechanical ticks, scanning left and right. Its body was stained a deep, unnatural blue‚Äîthe wood polished to a mirror shine, almost wet-looking under the sun. Its eyes glowed faintly; White then blue, Like LED bulbs on top of the now unused cop cars. That's why I took to calling them the puppet police. 

I stayed hidden in a parked van until it wandered off. I told myself it was a fluke. Then I saw two more near the park. They moved in tandem, slowly patrolling the swing sets, their heads rotating independently of their torsos. One stopped in front of a sandpit, tilted its head, then stabbed a long metal rod into the ground like it was testing something.

They didn‚Äôt see me. But they were looking for something, possibly me.

Now I see them everywhere.

They patrol in pairs or threes, always blue-stained, always gleaming. They walk in slow, calculated steps, scanning streets, peering through windows, stopping by mailboxes like they remember what they‚Äôre for without remembering how they work. My days rapidly turned into a blur of searching for places to hide; I do my best to avoid them by going in odd places that would be difficult to reach. 

My closed brush with the puppet police was last night. I holled up in an old dusty attic; I decided it was a tactical spot for the night. I should be able to open or close the ceiling door from the inside if I needed to; funnily enough. If push came to shove I'd be able to kick them down the sloping attic steps, with my experience at Ms. Roth's i would hope they shatter into a million pieces upon impact with the floor underneath. 

While getting ready for bed that night I heard the front door I used to get into the house make a loud scraping noise against the uneven floorboards, those damn puppets had gotten in. hurriedly, i tiptoed my way over to the attic door and began to slowly shut the hatch. I was sadly too late, I had the door about a quarter inch away from being sealed shut when I saw the blue stained wooden foot clack against the floorboards at the end of the hall. With another ominous clack the puppet police came clear into view. I watched it from that crack in the flat attic door. I was afraid to breathe wrong or make any semblance of noise. But I was laying flat with my chest pressed up against a nail or something. Attic trash I had come to call it, most likely a remnant from the ppl that had built this place.

The pain from that tinsey point of pressure was quickly becoming too much to handle, I shifted my weight; the sound of my shirt sliding across the plywood floor emanated from the hatch like a gentle whisper. It turned its head toward me and paused for six full seconds. Then moved on. 

I layed there for around 30 more minutes after I heard the puppet take its leave from the house. I was too scared to move. I had never thought about how sensitive they're hearing actually is. I don‚Äôt cook. I barely breathe when I move through buildings now. Every sound could bring them closer. I don‚Äôt know what gave me away. Maybe the broken puppet. Maybe I‚Äôve been too loud. Or maybe they were always going to notice. I‚Äôm not like them. I don‚Äôt fit.

So I‚Äôve stopped trying to pretend. There is no meandering through open streets. No more scavenging during daylight. I‚Äôm underground now or high up in attics, crawling through basements, sleeping in ductwork, hiding in crawl spaces like a rat. If you‚Äôre out there, if anyone‚Äôs out there; please help. I'm still here. But I‚Äôm cornered. And they‚Äôre getting closer.


I haven‚Äôt written in a few days. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to. I just didn‚Äôt know how to explain what happened. I was sleeping in an old laundromat, behind a wall of busted dryers. The puppet police had passed by twice, but never came in. I stayed quiet, hidden, still.

Then I heard footsteps. Not the sharp, stilted clack of the patrols, they were similar but softer, uneven. Like someone dragging a foot.

I held my breath. And then a voice raspy, hoarse. Wooden but real, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scream,‚Äù it said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like them.‚Äù He stepped into view like he‚Äôd always known where I was. Like he‚Äôd been waiting for me to stop running.

He told me his name is Milo. He looks like the others: wooden joints, stiff posture, carved smile that doesn‚Äôt quite reach the eyes. But something was off. Not in a bad way at first, Milo was just; off, a little different. He blinked. Moved with a kind of stiffness that felt self-conscious, like he was learning to be human.

He told me he ‚Äúwoke up wrong.‚Äù Said he still hears annoying songs playing on loop in his head when no one's around, that he dreams of kitchens and rainstorms and birthday candles. Things he swears he never really likes but thinking about it feels good in what he said were his ‚Äúmetaphorical bones‚Äù.

We talked for a long time. He showed me how to move at night, how to avoid the puppet police patrols. Told me where to find clean water as well as what buildings are mostly abandoned.

He‚Äôs been helpful. Generous, even. Possibly too much so.

I don‚Äôt know. He watches me when I sleep. He doesn't think I notice, but I do. His smile never fades. Not even when he's quiet. Not even when there's nothing to smile about. I highly doubt he would be able to stop smiling even if he wanted to though. With it being permanently carven into his wooden face and all. 

He asks a lot of questions. Most of them were strange and felt out of place. ‚ÄúDo you ever miss being part of something bigger?‚Äù , ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be easier if you didn‚Äôt have to hide?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDo you think anyone would blame you for giving up?‚Äù He says it like he‚Äôs just curious.  But sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm being studied.

Still it's nice having someone to talk to. I don‚Äôt have anyone else. And for now, I need him.

If you're reading this: I'm okay. I think. But something tells me I shouldn‚Äôt stay in one place too long.


Post 7

Milo knows how to pick a nice crib 

The apartment we found wasn‚Äôt much, it was high up; we would hear them coming up the stairs well before any puppet could reach us. The apartment was simple but good enough for two guys on the run. Just four walls, a busted lock, and a working TV that hissed with static like a warning. Milo called it ‚Äútemporary.‚Äù Said we‚Äôd keep moving. There were no puppet sightings around here though, so we decided to stay a bit longer.

Days passed. He got quieter while I grew more paranoid. Milo never slept. I was unsure if a puppet needed to. He just... sat there. Sometimes he would watch the door, other times he would watch me. Sometimes, I‚Äôd catch him standing perfectly still, as if waiting for a cue I couldn‚Äôt hear. But Milo was always doing weird puppet shit I didn't understand, he said he couldn't help it. It was like the world would go black for a second and then he was back. 

I stopped sleeping when he ‚Äúwent dark‚Äù like that. I started sleeping with one eye open when he was present. I kept telling myself he was trying; Maybe he was more human than puppet, Maybe he wanted the same thing I did. 

But last night, the TV turned itself on. I was dozing on the floor when the static cleared. The jingle was warped, slowed down, like a children‚Äôs show melting in the sun. A puppet appeared on-screen. Its head twitched. The paint was cracked. Its mouth barely moved, like it had been forced open.

PUPPET NEWSCASTER (glitching):
‚ÄúDÃ∏Ã°ÕùeÃµÕòaÃ∂ÕùrÃµ Ã∑cÃ¥iÃ¥tÃ∂iÃ∂zÃ∏eÃ∏nÃ∏sÃ∏... congratulations... yÃ∂oÃ∑uÃ∑rÃ∂ Ã∏cÃµoÃ∂mÃ∏pÃ∂lÃ∏iÃ∂aÃ∏nÃ∑cÃ∑eÃ∂ Ã∑hÃµaÃ∑sÃ∏ Ã¥eÃ∑nÃ¥sÃ¥uÃ∂rÃ∑eÃ¥dÃ∏ Ã∂pÃ¥eÃ∑aÃ∂cÃ∑eÃ∑‚Ä¶‚Äù
Behind it, a grainy banner unfurled.
‚ÄúOPERATION: RECLAMATION ‚Äì TARGET ACQUIRED‚Äù

Then my heart hopped out of my chest when I saw His face; Not as Milo, as Special Agent Mike. Same carved smile. Same glassy eyes. Only now he wore a badge and blue varnish on his arm. He was saluting like a proud cop in a news article would. I looked over. Milo wasn‚Äôt watching the screen, instead he stared at me with a nearly murderous intent. He was watching me. His voice was cold this time. Unapologetic. ‚ÄúI told them you‚Äôd be here. I just needed you to stay still.‚Äù I ran to the window. They were everywhere. Hundreds of them. Wooden patrols marching in perfect silence, surrounding the building like termites encasing a dying tree. The TV glitched again. A final 

message:
‚ÄúHarmonization successful. Prepare for integration.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how much time I have. The floor is creaking. The door handle is turning. If you‚Äôre reading this, run DO NOT STAY HERE! Don‚Äôt trust the ones who still talk. They remember enough to lie.

Review:

Customers love the coffee table's mid-century modern style and find it worth the price, with storage space coming in handy for blankets and other items. The build quality and assembly receive mixed feedback - while some find it sturdy and easy to put together, others note it's not very well built and can be difficult to assemble. The size and leg stability are also mixed aspects, with some saying it fits perfectly in small apartments while others find it smaller than expected, and some reporting that the legs start falling off.

Here's the problem - I also have a mom. A mom who wants to ""just meet up for lunch"" because ""it will be fun."" I like my mom; she's fine. So I would feel like a horrible person if I didn't see her and just left her to be alone on Mother's Day.

That wasn't a great time in my life, I'm better than ever now!
To put it simply, I'm an extrovert person that couldn't physically reach friends or family for many weeks due to weather problems caused to public transportation and also due to an early university exam.
I stayed at my studying city for the sole purpose of doing said exam and only then finding a way to go back home.
What about it? Well, for the first time in my life, thanks to the alignment of situations, thought, isolation and exam induced anxiety, I had fallen into derealization.
Not depersonalization, just derealization. 
To try and mantain my heart and mind together, since I couldn't use my favourite art materials (those were at home, not in that apartment), I decided to use what I had: colored pencils and a big 36√ó30cm sketchbook I had with me at that time. 
The feeling of using pencils onto paper as if I had to carve into it made me feel like I was tearing up the delusion I felt during the excruciating heavy rains and isolation.
Enjoy with an open mind. This sketchbook really helped me.

[P.S. I did reach out to psychological help that was available for students, but at the only time I needed to see someone the most, unfortunately, it was only available throught videocall. I cried a lot, I called friends and family and tried to explain it the best I could, that I was afraid of dying. It was a slow recovery, since the derealization is a strong scar that doesn't really ""disappear"", it's like you can always feel it, but not so heavily. But that's not what this post is really about. 
I think derealization can hit anybody like it did with me. For what I can say by experience, there has to be a level of high self-awareness. I hadn't ever used any kind of substances, if not for coffee or tea (lmao). I also am not entirely sure about my beliefs regarding religion, but I came from a faithful catholic family.]",1,1746556260.0,ARTIST,0,1.0,False

I am currently looking for someone to fill a room with its own separate bathroom and closet as seen below. The room will also come furnished with a bed frame and table. The pricing will be $1700 a month (unless you got someone you can roommate with) with no required security deposit. Location is very convenient as it is right next to the UCSD campus with the 201, 202 and 30 bus stops only being a 2 minute walk away. The trolley station is 15 minutes away walking. If you have a car, parking is included and a space will be given in the built-in garage. Everything is included in the rent except for Electricity and Water. The water bill is split among the whole building. The apartment unit itself comes with a kitchen (fridge and microwave + stove with oven + Pantry space ), living room (couch, coffee table and TV). There is also a laundromat, gym, pool, volleyball court and BBQ grills on the premises. We also have a guard patrolling the area every now and then. The current leasing term will end at the end of June which will be followed by a renewal of the lease in July with flexible options. If you're interested in touring the place or have any more questions please reach out to me at [despinozadepablo@ucsd.edu](mailto:despinozadepablo@ucsd.edu) :) FYI: ( Someone is currently in the room but will vacate the premises by mid June so if you are okay with a roommate for a month or two, rent can be split evenly ).

 My boyfriend kind of moved in with me after breaking his nose. He wanted to hide it from his mom, so he stayed with me, and it slowly turned into him living with me all the time. He once told his friends that the moment he fell in love with me was when I washed his hair while he was injured he said I felt like a mother taking care of him.

At the time, he didn‚Äôt have enough money to live with me properly. I live alone and cover all rent, groceries, bills, toiletries, cleaning everything. Once his money ran out, I paid for everything. He kept promising he‚Äôd give me the 20k allowance he gets from his dad each month, and to be fair, he did pay part of it. But even the full 20k wouldn‚Äôt be enough to cover his actual expenses.

So what really happened was: I get money from my parents for my own survival, and I had to financially sacrifice to fit him into my budget. I started cooking every other day instead of ordering like I used to, stopped buying anything for myself, and always went for cheaper food options instead of the stuff I normally enjoyed. I never signed up to struggle like that just to keep someone else afloat.

Eventually, my parents came down, and he had to leave. After that, I told him I couldn‚Äôt afford to live with him again not financially, not mentally. I said let‚Äôs just meet on weekends and go on actual dates because while we were living together, we stopped doing anything fun. In the beginning, we had dates. Now? Nothing.

We were supposed to go on a New Year‚Äôs trip canceled. He wanted to stay in and play games with his brother and his brother‚Äôs boyfriend. On Valentine‚Äôs Day, I was clearly making an effort (I made him a scrapbook), and he did nothing. Said he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo Valentine‚Äôs, it‚Äôs just another day.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting gifts just effort.

One night, we went drinking and came home late. I had work the next morning and a gig after that, so I told him I really needed to sleep. He said we‚Äôd have quick sex and then he‚Äôd leave, but he didn‚Äôt stop when I asked him to. I told him again I was tired and needed rest, but he kept kissing and touching me until I gave in. I only got 3 hours of sleep. He slept all day because he doesn't have a job. It felt like his satisfaction came before my physical well-being.

He also started filming during sex even though I had clearly said before that I didn‚Äôt want that. I had a traumatic experience with an ex. But in the moment, when he asked again, I couldn‚Äôt say no because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it. I asked him later to delete it, and he said it‚Äôs in his hidden files and only he can see it but I don‚Äôt want it there at all. I shouldn‚Äôt have to beg for that.

He once told me he wanted to try anal, and when I said no because it hurts, he said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really gonna let me die without it?‚Äù That made me feel like a checklist item, not a person.

Another red flag I ignored: he once casually mentioned he got a girl pregnant before and got it fixed

He says he wants to move to Australia with me, but honestly, it feels like he‚Äôs just following his friends there not actually building a future with me. He did his degree because his brother told him to. He just follows others. Shouldn‚Äôt we be planning life together?

Now he‚Äôs glued to his PS. Even on weekends when he‚Äôs supposed to spend time with me, he brings it over and plays all day. I live in a studio apartment if all he wants to do is game, he can go home.

He keeps wanting to bring his friends over to my place to play video games even when I say I want time alone with him. He‚Äôll say ‚Äúwanna play a game?‚Äù and I‚Äôll say ‚Äúyeah, just us?‚Äù and he goes ‚Äúaww,‚Äù and starts talking about bringing his boyfriend and his boyfriend‚Äôs boyfriend over too. Like no I get weekends off and I don‚Äôt want to host people or clean up after them. This is my place, not his.

He does do chores when he‚Äôs around dishes, takes out trash, wipes the table. But like‚Ä¶ I cook, make coffee, clean up after him, and cover costs. Doing the bare minimum doesn‚Äôt make him a saint. He still lives with his parents and acts like him helping at all is a big deal.

Today, he said sorry for being too into his PS5. But does that even mean anything anymore?

I think I‚Äôm falling out of love.

Additionally, I sometimes feel dizzy or see spots before my eyes, or experience chest pains.
I‚Äôm taking methylphenidate, bupropion, oral minoxidil, clonidine, and occasionally drink coffee. I often experience palpitations. Position changes, such as standing up quickly, cause my heart to beat faster sometimes I feel these symptoms during the day without any obvious trigger.
It‚Äôs usually worse when I focus on it I‚Äôve noticed that when I‚Äôm talking to people and engaged in conversation, the symptoms are absent. In stressful situations, it gets worse and becomes a cycle: when I feel the physical symptoms, I start worrying about them etc.

I used beta blockers for a while and they controlled the palpitations very well but I felt weird while taking them. They didn‚Äôt affect my blood pressure at all, which was generally within the normal range, but under the influence of stimulants and stress, it would occasionally spike to around 140 (though rarely). My doctor prescribed clonidine to address that and also to support treatment for ADHD and anxiety, and it does work better than propranolol in that regard.
However, it doesn‚Äôt help much with my palpitations, which is why I‚Äôm wondering whether this is dangerous. I don‚Äôt want to add yet another medication, and I‚Äôm not even sure whether I could take a beta blocker again right now.

Entry 1 

I have no idea what's going on right now and im scared



When I woke up yesterday, something felt off. It's not even that it felt off, it smelled wrong; like someone had used a power saw to chop up wood in my room. I slipped on some flannel pyjama pants and a day-old shirt I found on the floor and headed downstairs.

 Usually on a sunday morning my mom would be in the kitchen frying up bacon while scrambling eggs muttering to herself about how something always burns. Instead my mom was sitting at the kitchen table completely motionless, her hands wrapped around her coffee cup. I could tell the cup was still warm from the steam wafting out of the mug. Then my heart sank. She wasn‚Äôt breathing, She wasn‚Äôt blinking, She was as still as a murder victim in a horror flick.

Her eyes were like glass orbs. I mean that literally, Reflective, rounded, and just slightly too large for her face. Her skin looked smooth at first‚Äîalmost too smooth‚Äîuntil I got closer and realized it wasn‚Äôt skin at all. It was wood. Pale, polished wood with tiny carved lines where her mouth should be. Her nose was a perfect triangle. Like something you'd see on a marionette in a creepy puppet theater, not on your mother.

I called her name. I shook her. I screamed. Nothing. Her head flopped over a little when I grabbed her shoulders; like a doll weighted wrong. I thought maybe it was just her. A stroke? A seizure? A delusion? So I ran outside. That‚Äôs when I saw Mr. Jeffers, our neighbor, standing on his porch in a baby blue bathrobe and bright pink slippers. Just standing. Not moving. Not breathing. His mouth was frozen in a permanent smile, carved deep and wide into his wooden face. A bluebird landed on his shoulder and pecked at his cheek and he didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt even twitch.

Everyone on the street was like that. My neighbours sat completely still in cars that were still running in their driveways. A lawn mower sat abandoned mid-lap across someone‚Äôs yard while its owner was lying flat in the grass. A mail carrier frozen mid-step with one leg in the air. I think I screamed, then fell over before scurrying back inside like a scared bunny rabbit. That day was a blur, I tried to call an ambulance, nobody picked up. I biked to other neighbourhoods looking for someone, anyone who would help. It was the same story no matter where I went. So I went back home.

I stayed inside for hours, waiting for someone to knock, to say it was a prank, a chemical leak, a dream. But no one did. I found myself eating an entire box of cereal. Then I puked it up. Not because it was bad. Just because I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

It‚Äôs the next morning now. Or the morning after that. I haven‚Äôt slept. I don‚Äôt think I can. Everyone is still there. All of them. Not dead. Just... paused. Or puppets. I don‚Äôt know what to call them. But it‚Äôs like the world stopped moving without me; and I‚Äôm the only one who didn‚Äôt get turned off. 

Please, If you're reading this, tell me I‚Äôm not the only one.


Entry 2

I think they're moving but I really can't be sure as of right now 

I don't think I imagined it. I thought maybe I was sleep-deprived, possibly Hallucinating. But I swear, I saw the mailman tilt his head yesterday. Just a little. Just enough to peer over at my house. I froze when I saw it. For a second, I doubted it moved. But then he blinked.

Then this morning, I noticed Mr. Jefferson wasn't on the porch anymore.They‚Äôre moving. Not all at once. Not like a switch flipped. But gradually‚Äîjerkily‚Äîlike marionettes remembering they have strings again.

My mom is in a different position now. It's not like she's in a different room or anything, she‚Äôs still at the kitchen table, but her coffee cup is tipped over, and her hand is on the tablecloth like she was reaching for something to dry the coffee with. I know I didn't move it. I didn‚Äôt touch anything.

At first I thought maybe I knocked it over when I was shaking her the other day. But I know I didn't knock it over then. Whatever happened I still needed to clean up the spill. As I went upstairs to grab a towel I nearly had a heart attack. My sister, or her puppet ( I don't know what to call them) was standing in the doorway of her room. I had actually forgotten about her; being wrapped up in whatever was going on around here, but now she‚Äôs upright. Silent. Her painted eyes staring at me, wide, wrong, and grinning.

I rushed over and slammed her door shut and shoved a chair from my room up under the door knob. Not because I thought it would help. But because I needed to do something.
Something‚Äôs happening. Something‚Äôs waking them up. And then‚Ä¶ just now‚Ä¶ I got an email notification. I popped open my laptop, it sprung to life, surprisingly still connected to Wi-Fi Somehow. I pulled up the new email hoping someone had seen my post from earlier. But the website was wrong everywhere it should have read Gmail it now read Gtree., i scrolled down to the new treemail i guess 

The sender read mariennettNewsNetwork@gtree.com. No subject. Just a single file: ""welcome_back.mp4""
I clicked it.

First came the sound ‚Äî a warped xylophone jingle, all wrong in tone and timing, like a corrupted children‚Äôs show theme run through a rusted music box. The screen glitched, then bloomed into a burst of red and yellow so bright it hurt to look at. The colors pulsed, oversaturated and feverish.
Then the ‚Äúnews anchor‚Äù appeared.
It was a wooden puppet in a stiff, child‚Äôs parody of a suit and tie, sitting behind a desk that looked like it had been cobbled together from toy blocks. Its mouth opened and closed with a loose, clacking rhythm, always a split-second out of sync with the voice‚Äîan eerily cheerful, robotic tone that sounded like a kindergarten teacher trapped in a loop.
‚ÄúGood morning, happy citizens!‚Äù the voice chirped.
 ‚ÄúWelcome to a bright new era!‚Äù
Above the puppet‚Äôs head, a banner read: PUPPET REALITY DAILY.
The camera angle didn‚Äôt shift. The puppet didn‚Äôt blink. It simply stared, smiling, as the voice continued.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs top story: Reintegration Day is underway!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat does that mean for you and your fellow citizens? It means joy, purpose, and glorious synchronization!‚Äù
There was a burst of static, and the puppet‚Äôs head jerked hard to the left. A beat of silence. Then it snapped back into place as if nothing had happened.
‚ÄúAny individuals experiencing confusion, dissonance, or persistent ‚Äòhuman residue‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî and here the voice took on an odd, singsong lilt ‚Äî ‚Äúshould report to their nearest Harmonization Center immediately.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour compliance ensures a smooth and splinter-free future!‚Äù
Behind the puppet, a looping animation played: a cartoon family of wooden figures holding hands in front of a house. The same house I grew up in, maybe. The loop repeated again and again‚Äîuntil, for just a fraction of a second, one of the family members glitched. Its face contorted in a silent scream, mouth stretched too wide, eyes black and bulging.
Then it snapped back to smiling like the rest.
The puppet anchor‚Äôs voice rose one final time.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our daily pledge!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI am wood.
 I am one.
 I am willing.‚Äù
The jingle swelled again, more distorted now. The puppet grinned wider, impossibly wide.
Then the screen froze mid-note.
And cut to black.

The Wi-Fi is still running. Electricity too.  Something‚Äôs keeping the world alive‚Äîeven if it isn‚Äôt us anymore.

They‚Äôre broadcasting now. Talking to each other. Or to me.I doubt they were ever just frozen. I think they were watching. And now they‚Äôre ready.

Entry 3

I dont think it's safe here anymore. 

 After I saw that news clip on treemail I decided to make a run for it. I wasn't going to stay put anymore, I'll find someone, I know I will. At first, I thought I was dreaming. Now I know I'm not.

 This morning I found myself waking up with the sun directly overhead; I was inside a dense bush I saw in someone's yard. The sleep wasn't the best i've ever had but in my sleep-deprived state it felt heavenly. After putting my blanket back in the backpack I was using as a makeshift pillow, I crawled out from my little shrubby safe haven. 

I walked down Oak Avenue and saw Mr. Delaney, my old school bus driver. But his head was too round. His skin too smooth. And his hands made a hard clack-clack sound as they gripped the steering wheel. Just like always‚Äîsame navy jacket, same coffee-stained Yankees cap. He pulled the bus up to the curb. It had to be somewhere around noon; I found myself pretty confused as to why he was out and about with the school bus. There were no kids. No sound. Just him. Sitting there. Waiting for children who weren‚Äôt coming.

I hid behind a tree and watched. After exactly five minutes, he closed the bus doors, then he drove up the curb, slamming the front of the bus into a mailbox before he unremorsefully made the most illegal U-turn I'd ever seen in my life. Then he drove off in silence, it was like muscle memory from a life he didn't know was gone.

Further down, I saw a jogger still in a nightgown, someone I think used to be Ms. Nguyen from whatever real estate agency that kept on trying to buy the house off my mom. Her wooden knees were pumping stiffly, arms swinging too high. Her mouth was painted into a smile that never moved. When she passed me, I swear she turned her head just a little. Not all the way. Just enough to let me know she saw me. She didn‚Äôt stop running. Everything feels like‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs been programmed, or Looped.

 The puppets have jobs, routines; they‚Äôre still doing them, even if they don‚Äôt make sense anymore. The grocery store lights were on. Music played overhead. I went in, There were no customers. However, every cashier was standing at their register. Some of them stood there unmoving, wooden eyes locked onto me like I was doing something that was taboo to them. A few cashiers scanned invisible items over and over again, the motion looping like a broken animatronic. A bagger dropped nothing into a paper sack and passed it down the conveyor belt to no one.

I backed out slowly. I didn‚Äôt want to be noticed. I don‚Äôt think they want me gone.
 But I don‚Äôt think they want me to interfere either. Something is‚Ä¶ keeping the world running. Not alive. Just moving.

I was eating a can of cold beans by flashlight in the abandoned tech section of a walmart. The tvs were still running now and all of them were showing that new news station ‚ÄúMNN‚Äù or marinnett news network.

There was no warning this time. No jingle. Just a crackle of static and a voice‚Äîbright, bubbly, and wrong.

‚ÄúAttention! Attention!
 This is your daily guidance from the Office of Orderly Living!‚Äù
The voice was sharper now. Not cheerful like the first time‚Äîmore forced. Like it was smiling with clenched teeth.
‚ÄúAll citizens must now report for weekly inspections! That‚Äôs right! Your health, your shine, and your synchronization must be evaluated for optimal performance!‚Äù

The words slithered into my ears like splinters. I could hear the capital letters.
I didn‚Äôt even need a screen to picture it anymore. I saw the puppet anchor in my mind‚Äîjaw clicking up and down, head slightly crooked. Behind it, I imagined a cartoon graphic: a puppet sitting on a tiny exam table while another scraped its joints with a file and polished its cheeks until they gleamed.
The voice shifted tone‚Äîslower, lower, like it was reading a warning label no one ever reads.
‚ÄúRot is a crime.
 Deviation is disobedience.
 Self-direction is a splintering hazard.‚Äù
There was a beat of static. And then something else crept in‚Äîa faint mechanical whine, like a saw blade spinning up in the distance.
‚ÄúRefusal to attend inspection will result in‚Ä¶ immediate repurposing.‚Äù
My skin crawled. I pictured another graphic, too vivid: limbs unscrewed and reattached in new shapes. Faces carved into benches. A puppet laughing as its own smile was nailed into place.Then, as before, the voice snapped back into cheer.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our daily pledge!‚Äù
I mouthed the words before they came‚Äîlike a spell being recited over and over until it loses all meaning:
I am wood.
I am one.
I am willing.


Entry 4 
I broke one, i didn't mean to they're just fragile 
I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting. Maybe that there was still a person in there, somewhere. Maybe I thought if I just shook one hard enough, if I pulled hard enough, they'd snap out of it. Like sleepwalking. Like a bad dream.

It happened this morning. I walked into a part of town I don‚Äôt normally go to‚Äîan older neighborhood, the kind of place that‚Äôs always felt distant,or rundown like a different world. Maybe that‚Äôs why I picked it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to see any familiar faces. I just wanted answers. I needed to know what‚Äôs left of all this.

Soon I found my target, a random cashier at Mrs. Roth‚Äôs bakery, an older looking puppet with gray curls and a permanent smile, stood behind the counter, constantly handing out bread and cookies then dropping them on the floor. She stood there performing her job except there were no customers to take the goodies. when I stepped inside, she instantly froze. The puppet stood there motionless. Still in her apron, Still smiling that same, frozen smile. Her eyes, though... there was nothing behind them. Just glass.

I stood there for a long time. Just staring at her. I don‚Äôt even know why I didn‚Äôt leave. Maybe I thought if I stayed long enough, she‚Äôd blink. Maybe if I waited, the human part of her would come back. thenI walked closer. Took one step. Then another. And then I whispered, softly; ‚Äúhello? Is anyone there?‚Äù No response.

I reached for her shoulder first, her wooden body was cold to the touch. Too cold. The way plastic feels. Or the way you imagine a mannequin might feel. I swallowed hard and grabbed her wrist instead. It was lighter than it should have been. Hollow. Like it had been emptied out, like the wood was carved thin, and the skin was only a layer over the emptiness. I don‚Äôt even think I meant to pull that hard. I thought it would be like tugging a blanket or shaking someone awake.

But when I yanked I heard a loud CRACK. Like the wrist had no more give. It was as if it wasn‚Äôt a joint anymore. Just a fragile piece of furniture. My stomach dropped, I don't know why I felt so sickened by my actions. 

Then the arm fell off, I couldn‚Äôt even catch it. It fell to the ground with a clack, rolling slightly before stopping. The woman's head tipped to the side, her smile didn't waver. Her eyes stayed wide open.

I just stood there. And I stared. Stared at her hand in mine, then the arm on the floor. I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt even cry. I just dropped the hand, turned around, And walked out of that bakery like it wasn‚Äôt real. I must have ran for miles. Through streets I didn‚Äôt recognize, just trying to get away. attempting  to get my feet to move faster and faster.

They‚Äôre not asleep. They‚Äôre not dreaming. They‚Äôre finished. They‚Äôre locked in place standing rigid, empty. Set in motion until something or someone comes around to pull their strings. And I can‚Äôt change it, I can‚Äôt fix it, I can‚Äôt even wake them up.I think I knew that deep down. But it hurts more, having tried.

Entry 5

Breaking her was a mistake 

I didn‚Äôt mean to stop, I was just passing through one of the outer neighborhoods; cookie-cutter houses that all looked the same. Like they‚Äôd been stamped out of some suburban mold, painted black and white. Nothing Seemed to have moved out here in days. The only sound was the wind rustling through the desolate trees lining the roads. 

That was it seemed that way until I heard the faint jingle of the MNN emanating from each of the houses. I could see the faint lights of a tv flashing through the curtains or blinds of each house. I wanted to know what the puppets were going to do next, so I snuck onto each porch I came across until I found one, there was a crack big enough to see the whole tv. I crept closer, staying low. Pressed myself flat against the concrete siding. The window was half-open, I could clearly see Inside, a puppet family sat in a living room frozen in perfect domestic bliss. A father-puppet on the recliner. A mother-puppet on the couch with a tea cup glued to her wooden fingers. Two smaller ones on the carpet between them, cross-legged, staring ahead with glassy, painted-on eyes. The TV was on. And that voice was back.

‚ÄúSpecial bulletin! This is a priority transmission from Puppet Reality Daily!‚Äù
The anchor-puppet on the screen looked newer than the others‚Äîsleek varnish, brighter eyes, tighter jaw hinge. Behind it, a bold red banner read:
 NON-COMPLIANT ACTIVITY DETECTED: ‚ÄúAuthorities are on high alert for an anomaly in District Seven. An unidentified non-compliant unit has tampered with a fully synchronized citizen!‚Äù
My stomach felt like it was on some kind of crazy rollercoaster, wobbling up and down left then right. I knew there was some form of communication between them. Obviously they had the news; now I know they've organized themselves beyond that. 
In my brief moment of shock I took a step back only for the floorboards under me to make a loud CREEEEK noise. I didn‚Äôt breathe. I could feel the sweat freezing on my back as I watched,half expecting the puppet children on the carpet to move, they didn't, they didn't even blink. I wondered if they even could. Or if they were just placed there, something like props on a set, arranged for the nightly performance.

‚ÄúThis act of disruption has caused irreparable damage to a loyal neighbor-unit. But don‚Äôt worry! Harmony will be restored.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe remind all citizens that tampering, resisting, or unsanctioned interaction is a punishable offense. Any ‚Äòfree expression‚Äô not aligned with group unity will be swiftly... corrected.‚Äù
‚ÄúHave you seen something strange? A unit moving against the grain? A citizen who speaks out of sync? Report all deviant behavior to your nearest Observer Drone.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd remember:
 I am wood.
 I am one.
 I am willing.‚Äù

At that moment, I became very aware of the power lines above me; of the rusted garden gnome by the gate. As well as the eerie silence all around me. I began to study the neighbourhood, I looked for anything out of place. And that's when I saw them, all of them, it didn't look like America. It looked like the system was directly imported from another country.  On each telephone pole looking in nearly every direction; dark camera bulbs embedded in the wood, one of the cameras was aimed square at the house, seemingly at me and me.	The screen on the TV froze mid-jingle,the puppet family hadn't reacted. The light flickered once, then died. Silence again. I ducked away from the window and kept moving.

They know I'm not a puppet, one of them must have reported me. Probably the one at Ms. Roth's bakery. I had a feeling the answers I wanted would come at a cost, after a few days I had come to think the punishment was my feelings of misery for breaking some-thing that used to be human; I was terribly mistaken. They were using some kind of camera system to track my movements. 

I didn't think. I didn't even contemplate my next move; I ran. I ran as hard and fast as my legs would go. There was no stopping to look back. There was no shaking the feeling they were about to start hunting me. I wanted to get as far from civilization as I could. Neighborhoods, stores, and parks aren't safe anymore. 

Entry 6

I think they know I'm still human. I'm hiding now. I don't know how much longer I have

I used to think I was invisible. In the beginning, I walked through town like a ghost. The puppet people didn‚Äôt flinch when I passed. They just stood there like statues posed in still-life scenes of old routines, clutching briefcases, watering plants. It was like I didn‚Äôt register at all.

But that‚Äôs changed. I noticed the first one three days ago; It was on Main Street, standing by the library steps. Not like the others. This one moved. It jerked its head in mechanical ticks, scanning left and right. Its body was stained a deep, unnatural blue‚Äîthe wood polished to a mirror shine, almost wet-looking under the sun. Its eyes glowed faintly; White then blue, Like LED bulbs on top of the now unused cop cars. That's why I took to calling them the puppet police. 

I stayed hidden in a parked van until it wandered off. I told myself it was a fluke. Then I saw two more near the park. They moved in tandem, slowly patrolling the swing sets, their heads rotating independently of their torsos. One stopped in front of a sandpit, tilted its head, then stabbed a long metal rod into the ground like it was testing something.

They didn‚Äôt see me. But they were looking for something, possibly me.

Now I see them everywhere.

They patrol in pairs or threes, always blue-stained, always gleaming. They walk in slow, calculated steps, scanning streets, peering through windows, stopping by mailboxes like they remember what they‚Äôre for without remembering how they work. My days rapidly turned into a blur of searching for places to hide; I do my best to avoid them by going in odd places that would be difficult to reach. 

My closed brush with the puppet police was last night. I holled up in an old dusty attic; I decided it was a tactical spot for the night. I should be able to open or close the ceiling door from the inside if I needed to; funnily enough. If push came to shove I'd be able to kick them down the sloping attic steps, with my experience at Ms. Roth's i would hope they shatter into a million pieces upon impact with the floor underneath. 

While getting ready for bed that night I heard the front door I used to get into the house make a loud scraping noise against the uneven floorboards, those damn puppets had gotten in. hurriedly, i tiptoed my way over to the attic door and began to slowly shut the hatch. I was sadly too late, I had the door about a quarter inch away from being sealed shut when I saw the blue stained wooden foot clack against the floorboards at the end of the hall. With another ominous clack the puppet police came clear into view. I watched it from that crack in the flat attic door. I was afraid to breathe wrong or make any semblance of noise. But I was laying flat with my chest pressed up against a nail or something. Attic trash I had come to call it, most likely a remnant from the ppl that had built this place.

The pain from that tinsey point of pressure was quickly becoming too much to handle, I shifted my weight; the sound of my shirt sliding across the plywood floor emanated from the hatch like a gentle whisper. It turned its head toward me and paused for six full seconds. Then moved on. 

I layed there for around 30 more minutes after I heard the puppet take its leave from the house. I was too scared to move. I had never thought about how sensitive they're hearing actually is. I don‚Äôt cook. I barely breathe when I move through buildings now. Every sound could bring them closer. I don‚Äôt know what gave me away. Maybe the broken puppet. Maybe I‚Äôve been too loud. Or maybe they were always going to notice. I‚Äôm not like them. I don‚Äôt fit.

So I‚Äôve stopped trying to pretend. There is no meandering through open streets. No more scavenging during daylight. I‚Äôm underground now or high up in attics, crawling through basements, sleeping in ductwork, hiding in crawl spaces like a rat. If you‚Äôre out there, if anyone‚Äôs out there; please help. I'm still here. But I‚Äôm cornered. And they‚Äôre getting closer.


I haven‚Äôt written in a few days. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to. I just didn‚Äôt know how to explain what happened. I was sleeping in an old laundromat, behind a wall of busted dryers. The puppet police had passed by twice, but never came in. I stayed quiet, hidden, still.

Then I heard footsteps. Not the sharp, stilted clack of the patrols, they were similar but softer, uneven. Like someone dragging a foot.

I held my breath. And then a voice raspy, hoarse. Wooden but real, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scream,‚Äù it said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like them.‚Äù He stepped into view like he‚Äôd always known where I was. Like he‚Äôd been waiting for me to stop running.

He told me his name is Milo. He looks like the others: wooden joints, stiff posture, carved smile that doesn‚Äôt quite reach the eyes. But something was off. Not in a bad way at first, Milo was just; off, a little different. He blinked. Moved with a kind of stiffness that felt self-conscious, like he was learning to be human.

He told me he ‚Äúwoke up wrong.‚Äù Said he still hears annoying songs playing on loop in his head when no one's around, that he dreams of kitchens and rainstorms and birthday candles. Things he swears he never really likes but thinking about it feels good in what he said were his ‚Äúmetaphorical bones‚Äù.

We talked for a long time. He showed me how to move at night, how to avoid the puppet police patrols. Told me where to find clean water as well as what buildings are mostly abandoned.

He‚Äôs been helpful. Generous, even. Possibly too much so.

I don‚Äôt know. He watches me when I sleep. He doesn't think I notice, but I do. His smile never fades. Not even when he's quiet. Not even when there's nothing to smile about. I highly doubt he would be able to stop smiling even if he wanted to though. With it being permanently carven into his wooden face and all. 

He asks a lot of questions. Most of them were strange and felt out of place. ‚ÄúDo you ever miss being part of something bigger?‚Äù , ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be easier if you didn‚Äôt have to hide?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDo you think anyone would blame you for giving up?‚Äù He says it like he‚Äôs just curious.  But sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm being studied.

Still it's nice having someone to talk to. I don‚Äôt have anyone else. And for now, I need him.

If you're reading this: I'm okay. I think. But something tells me I shouldn‚Äôt stay in one place too long.


Post 7

Milo knows how to pick a nice crib 

The apartment we found wasn‚Äôt much, it was high up; we would hear them coming up the stairs well before any puppet could reach us. The apartment was simple but good enough for two guys on the run. Just four walls, a busted lock, and a working TV that hissed with static like a warning. Milo called it ‚Äútemporary.‚Äù Said we‚Äôd keep moving. There were no puppet sightings around here though, so we decided to stay a bit longer.

Days passed. He got quieter while I grew more paranoid. Milo never slept. I was unsure if a puppet needed to. He just... sat there. Sometimes he would watch the door, other times he would watch me. Sometimes, I‚Äôd catch him standing perfectly still, as if waiting for a cue I couldn‚Äôt hear. But Milo was always doing weird puppet shit I didn't understand, he said he couldn't help it. It was like the world would go black for a second and then he was back. 

I stopped sleeping when he ‚Äúwent dark‚Äù like that. I started sleeping with one eye open when he was present. I kept telling myself he was trying; Maybe he was more human than puppet, Maybe he wanted the same thing I did. 

But last night, the TV turned itself on. I was dozing on the floor when the static cleared. The jingle was warped, slowed down, like a children‚Äôs show melting in the sun. A puppet appeared on-screen. Its head twitched. The paint was cracked. Its mouth barely moved, like it had been forced open.

PUPPET NEWSCASTER (glitching):
‚ÄúDÃ∏Ã°ÕùeÃµÕòaÃ∂ÕùrÃµ Ã∑cÃ¥iÃ¥tÃ∂iÃ∂zÃ∏eÃ∏nÃ∏sÃ∏... congratulations... yÃ∂oÃ∑uÃ∑rÃ∂ Ã∏cÃµoÃ∂mÃ∏pÃ∂lÃ∏iÃ∂aÃ∏nÃ∑cÃ∑eÃ∂ Ã∑hÃµaÃ∑sÃ∏ Ã¥eÃ∑nÃ¥sÃ¥uÃ∂rÃ∑eÃ¥dÃ∏ Ã∂pÃ¥eÃ∑aÃ∂cÃ∑eÃ∑‚Ä¶‚Äù
Behind it, a grainy banner unfurled.
‚ÄúOPERATION: RECLAMATION ‚Äì TARGET ACQUIRED‚Äù
Then my heart hopped out of my chest when I saw His face; Not as Milo, as Special Agent Mike. Same carved smile. Same glassy eyes. Only now he wore a badge and blue varnish on his arm. He was saluting like a proud cop in a news article would. I looked over. Milo wasn‚Äôt watching the screen, instead he stared at me with a nearly murderous intent. He was watching me. His voice was cold this time. Unapologetic. ‚ÄúI told them you‚Äôd be here. I just needed you to stay still.‚Äù I ran to the window. They were everywhere. Hundreds of them. Wooden patrols marching in perfect silence, surrounding the building like termites encasing a dying tree. The TV glitched again. A final message:
‚ÄúHarmonization successful. Prepare for integration.‚Äù

1kgbtwt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgbtwt,Barnstable‚Äôs growing and so are fire calls. A $35 million station is on the table. Voters decide May 14.,"https://archive.is/0RAXk

>**Key Points:**

‚Ä¢ The current station, built in 1935, is overcrowded, lacks modern safety standards, and cannot accommodate the district's growth.

‚Ä¢ Funding would come from 30-year municipal bonds, initially costing property owners an estimated $0.40 per $1,000 of assessed value.

A new fire station is on the horizon for the Barnstable Fire District.


Now, voters face the final step: whether to approve $35.2 million to build the station.


Voters will weigh the project at the district‚Äôs annual meeting, which takes place May 14 at 7:30 p.m. in the Mary Pat Flynn Conference Room in the east wing of the old Barnstable County jail building, located within the Barnstable County complex, 3195 Main St., Barnstable.


There are two final chances to hear from district officials and ask questions. Nirvana Coffee is sponsoring a ""Coffee with the Chief"" on May 3, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at Sturgis Library, 3090 Main St. And on May 6 at 7 p.m., the Barnstable Village Association will host a presentation at St. Mary‚Äôs Church, 3055 Main St.


>**What's proposed?**

The fire station project is outlined in Article 18 on the fire district's annual meeting agenda. The proposal calls for demolishing the 2,000-square-foot Barnstable Water Department office structure, built in 1940 at 1841 Phinney's Lane, and replacing it with a new, modern fire station.


Moving operations to Phinney's Lane will provide ample space to meet the fire department's needs, with about 2.5 acres to build a station that can house the fleet of vehicles and boats ‚Äî some of which are now stored off site ‚Äî plus existing staff and anticipated staff additions.


>**Why a new Barnstable fire station is needed**

""We have outgrown our current location due to our need to increase staffing to meet the increase in calls,"" said Barnstable Fire Chief Chris Beal.


The current station, built in 1935 and expanded over the years, last underwent renovations in 2000. Beal said the department has no room left for expansion and has reached capacity in areas like lockers, bunkrooms, indoor apparatus space and administrative areas.


""Our current station is also lacking in current firefighter safety standards in many areas,"" he said.


This includes insufficient space to store gear and properly separate clean from dirty gear. Separating dirty gear is a critical safety issue, according to the International Association of Firefighters, because toxins can contaminate storage areas, working spaces, living areas, and other gear.


The station also fails to meet accessibility standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act.


>**Responding to growth**

The Barnstable Fire District, one of five in town, covers about 14 square miles along the Cape Cod Bay side of Barnstable, including around 2,200 residences in Barnstable Village and Cummaquid. Beal noted a shift in the origin of most department calls toward the nearby industrial park in the Independence Drive area south of the Mid-Cape Highway and north of Route 132, referred to by some as Independence Park.


""The proposed location of the new fire station places it in a strategic location enabling us to maintain a 6- to 8-minute response time to all our response area,"" Beal said.


He added, ""the new location and design will allow us to grow in the future as our call volume continues to grow as the development of the industrial park continues.""


The area, Beal said, is ""growing by leaps and bounds,"" and the fire district needs to be proactive about this growth to prepare for an expected increase in calls for service.


""In the next few years, we will have over 1,000 apartments in the industrial park area. This area also has a significant amount of acreage that potentially could be developed for a variety of purposes,"" he said.


As with many Cape Cod communities dealing with housing and new construction, he said, ""we are working through this housing crisis with a sense of urgency and trying to have the foresight to grow appropriately to meet the changing and growing needs of our residents and visitors.""


In addition to the industrial park ‚Äî home to Cape Cod Potato Chips, Shepley Wood Products, Home Depot, BJ's Wholesale Club, and the Vineyard Wind substation ‚Äî the fire department also covers three courthouses and the county‚Äôs headquarters.


The $35.2 million voters will consider on May 14 would fully fund the construction, Beal said, ‚Äúcreating a turnkey fire station upon completion that is projected to serve the Barnstable Fire District for the next 50 to 75 years.‚Äù


>**What it means for district property owners**


If voters approve the project, the fire district will issue one or more municipal bonds to cover the cost, paid over 30 years at a projected interest rate of 5%, Beal said.


In the first year, property owners in the fire district would pay an estimated $0.40 for every $1,000 of assessed property value. That rate would gradually decrease over the life of the bonds. For example, if a home is valued at $1,000,000, the homeowner could expect to pay about $400 in the first year, with smaller amounts each year after.


>**What happens to the water department?**

The fire district will use part of the $35.2 million to temporarily relocate the water department during construction, while officials continue evaluating its permanent location, Beal said.


""One possible option is to renovate the current station and move them in there, but we need to have the building evaluated and a cost to renovate for their needs completed before any final decision is made,"" he said.


Another vote on the water department's permanent location is likely in the next year or two.

Home is where you like being. Home is where you can be yourself. Home is what other people tell you is your home"". My parents told me their home is my home, and especially my room in my parents home is my home.

What I experienced though is that the longer I stayed in my home, that is my room, the more my parents got upset about being in my room. Being in my room was starting a ticking time bomb until my mother would erupt into my room with screaming at me ""Why are you spending all your time in your room? Why are you never going outside? Why are you not socializing? Stop reading books, stop drawing, go outside and do something"". This seemed like a strange thing to me, I ""did"" things I liked doing, how could I ""not"" do things if I did things? Made no sense to me.

The landlord didn't call them every 6 hours, asking ""What are you doing in \*my\* home?"", he only wanted to see money nothing more. And strangely enough, my parents didn't ask my brother every 6 hours to leave his home. He spent all his time in his room from morning till evening, without my parents being bothered. They dragged him outside here and there but simply because \*they\* wanted to socialize with him, not because they told him ""Go socialize with \*us\*"", the intention was different. It wasn't an ""eviction"", it was a reason.

Despite that, my parents still told me ""You are welcome at home. Home is the most beautiful place on earth! Don't you like being at home?"". No. Not at all. So, as I grew up, I have learned:

>Home is a place where the longer you are, the more upset you make other people until they forcefully throw you out because you simply are there

That's an interesting concept of a home, not gonna lie, and a disturbing one, leading to lots of cognitive dissonance. Stress is induced in me by staying at home, while being told that's ""my"" home. But how can my home, a place of comfort, cause increasing distress that only vanishes when I am \*not\* at my home? Does that mean I have no \*right\* to own a home, perhaps? Does that mean it \*is\* not my home, perhaps?

I liked staying up at night because then no one was there to throw me out. I also liked being at home when my parents were on vacation alone on rare occasions as I got older, because then they couldn't throw me out arbitrarily.

Interestingly, the longer I did not stay at ""home"", the better I felt. The forest didn't evict me from being there, only bad weather did. When I visited my friends at their home, they didn't evict me from their home, on the contrary, they \*liked\* me being there and wanted me to be there \*longer\*! Can you believe that! Incredible! I was more welcome at other people's homes, where I was nothing but a stranger, than at my \*own home\* my \*own parents\* live.

Incredible. Absolutely incredible, being regarded as a parasite at your own home. As if choose to grew up at my parents home, and no my parents forcing me to be there involuntarily due to youth, lack of money etc. You can't make that up, really.

What is sad is that by now, my parents realize they did something wrong in raising me, as they see the fundamental damage they caused, I blame myself for every problem, for example, even the onces my parents caused. It's too late though. I will never, ever consider something with 4 walls a home anymore for my entire life.

Home, to me, is a place where you don't get evicted from mere being. Home isn't a place you have to earn. Home isn't also a place you have a \*right\* to, because that implies someone else \*gives\* you a home, and can take it away from you at any given time. I don't have to earn a home, I also don't \*deserve\* a home, I have to \*find\* \*my\* home \*I\* created, not someone else. And \*this\* is the key difference. What my home is cannot be defined through external structures, like societal expectations, but only through me. I can create a home, but I can't be given it.

Maybe my parents didn't raise me wrong, maybe they just failed to tell me that a home isn't deserved, nor is it earned, it has to be found. Still, even if that's true, my parents were unnecessarily harsh on me.

I know where my home is though. It is outside ""my"" home, where no one judges me for being outside, a forest, a coffe shop, a restaurant, study rooms, McDonalds, anything you like. Home isn't somemthing \*I\* own, or have, \*I\* don't have a home. Home is something that \*is\*, independent of me. Home is a place where I can go at any time, which continues to exist in the absence of me. McDonalds exists even without me, and I can go there any time, so does the forest. It always was. It might not be forever, but as long as it exists, it exists.

You could say my home is someone else's home perhaps even, as long as it's not ""my"" home, because \*I\* don't deserve ""my"" home, it always requires some kind of value such as labour, work, money, social connections and so on. Since I don't deserve an intrinsic home, I have to find things which always are, even without me interacting, spending money. McDonalds exists all the time, and they prefer me being there \*even more\* by spending money there. I can do things there which make me \*even more\* welcome there. Sorry for this silly example with McDonalds, but it shows for me what I consider home.

A ""home"", 4 walls, to me, is a net negative. Sure, you spend money justifying owning it. But it is the bare minimum. Any damage: Your fault. You make your neighbours upset from being too loud? Your fault. So, anything you do in your ""home"" of 4 falls can lead to making other people upset. There isn't a positive reward loop. At McDonalds, the more you spend, the happier they are for you being there, it's a never ending positive reward loop for both sides. Renting, or owning a home, is being in inherent guilt. You have to ""deserve"" the right to be there. Sure, I have to buy something at McDonalds, but I am not ""forced"", I can simply not got there in the first place. With a ""home"", 4 walls, if I don't pay, I just can't ""go somewhere else"" to sleep, which is a fundamental difference. A home of 4 walls is a necessity to exist, a burden, the source of distress.

A home of 4 walls isn't where you can explore the world, new people. It is a place where you can wither, suddenly have a stroke and no one would bat an eye. Compare this with outside places where you can constantly get new inspiration, see and meet new people, meet old friends in passing, travel around as you like. When you are outside, \*you are seen\*, recognized, even passively. If you go daily to the coffee shop, you are recognized, you \*exist\* in the framework of the cashier. That doesn't mean the cashier cares about you, nor that he has to. But you \*exist\* in his life in some way or another, you \*are\*.

So, where is my home? Paradoxically, not where my home is. The moment I call \*a\* home \*my\* home it's game over, because as soon as \*a\* home becomes a property of mine, something I \*own\*, it is something that can be forcefully \*taken away\* from me at any given time. And, if something I own is a \*fundamental\* element of me that can be \*taken away\* forcefully even entirely arbitrarily at any given moment, this causes intrinsic distress. If a place that is \*my\* necessity for survival can be arbitrarily taken away from me, that means my survival is in danger.

So, where is \*my\* home? Not at \*my\* home because \*I\* can't have a home without having to fear for my survival.

Am I diagnosed with OCD and panic disorder? Yes. But even a person with OCD and panic disorder has to \*look\* (not \*have\*) a home. A home, that is stable, is unstable because the belief in stability leads to false belief in stability. The less stable, the less property, ""me"" bound, the more independent a home, the less I have to rely on it for my survival.

And isn't that what we all do, things ensuring our survival (in reasonable ways, of course)?",1,1746555950.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False

So I have been struggling with an issue for a bit that is private that very few people in my life know about (my husband, his best friend and my best friend are the only ones who know what‚Äôs going on). I found a support group that has been helping that meets once a week. It has been helpful. 

A few times, while on my way to the support group, I would call my mom to chit chat. Since I didn‚Äôt want to share where I was headed, I would always tell her that I was on my way to meet my bff or coffee. 

Then, for about two weeks, I was going to a lot of sports games. I‚Äôm a teacher and I had a bunch of students playing on the same team that made it to a big tournament that would take them to the state championship (sadly, they played an unfair team and didn‚Äôt make it). She called a couple of times while I was at games. 

She tried to FaceTime while I was driving to a game (in my city) to see my kids so I called her back and said I was on my way to another game. Our conversation went something like this:

Her: you seem to leave the kids at home with *husband* a lot. 

Me: you mean I leave them with their father?

Her: I‚Äôm just saying you seem to them at home with him a lot. 

Me: with their father?!?

Her: I‚Äôm just saying that he may come to resent it one day. 

Now I‚Äôm seething. She basically said I was neglecting my kids. I did not say everything I wanted to say like how I want my kids to see that I have a life outside of the house, that I can be comfortable and trust my husband with our kids, how when I was growing up I wanted her go no where and do nothing but read and play on the computer. 

But I didn‚Äôt. I chose my words very carefully and said, ‚Äúthe advice is not needed, thank you.‚Äù

She has a history of making small comments that I‚Äôve let slide like my house isn‚Äôt as clean as she kept hers (she hasn‚Äôt had a job since she went on maternity leave with me so of course her house would be cleaner than me working a full time job and raising two kids). 

But this time I decided to say something. You know what she did, she hung up on me. THEN she texted me at the game about how she doesn‚Äôt care how old I am, I am not going to be rude to her and she is older and seen more things and has my best interest at heart. 

I have now decided that she is on an informational diet where I am concerned. I will not keep her out of my kids lives because she is an excellent grandmother and my kids love her like crazy but she no longer will know what‚Äôs going on in my life. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm struggling. I DO want to keep her in my life to a point but I definitely want her included in my kids life but I find myself not calling or reaching out because I don‚Äôt want to share what going on in my life.

And because of stuff I haven't gotten another brewer (I want a switch), but nevertheless. I live in Mexico, so although there are a lot of local coffee shops and roasters, most of them roast to around medium-dark at least. I recently bought a bag from a local roaster that I haven't tried before and I was told they were medium roasted beans, but to my eyes they look at least at the beginning of a dark roast. And basically I have almost finished the bag and while tweaking with different parameters (following Hoffman's french press recipe mostly), all my cups have some level of unpleasant bitterness, or end up muted because of underextraction. While I know dark roasts are inherently keen to have more bitter compounds, I have actually been more successful in brewing supermarket coffees that get me a great cup of coffee and I say these because I know they are most likely dark roasted (pre-grounded, I have some interesting observations about pregound coffee that I will probably put in another post).

My current setup is a no-name brand stove gooseneck kettle with thermometer, and a Timemore C3 Max. For this coffee, my brewing parameters have been at around 86 - 92¬∞C  for the water and 16 - 19 clicks in the grinder, and I use bottled water that has already produced me some great cups with lightly roasted coffees. Edit: forgot to add my ratio, I've been going between 1:14 and 1:17, my most okayish cups have been between 1:15-16.4

So, am I doomed to getting bad cups from dark roasts for eternity, do you have some suggestions on how to improve my brews, and what has been your general experience brewing dark roasts?

Have had back pain post partum before that I could fix with physical therapy. Not this time. Despite doing my PT regularly the last 3 months, my back pain has gone from positional to all the time. It's not like when you pull a muscle and lock up. It's a deep ache, it is constant and worsens at night no matter what position I sleep in. Stiffness from being still regardless of length. I finally broke down and started taking my husband's celebrex he had left over from sinus surgery because Ibuprofen wasnt helping at all. It's helped a ton, but I'm almost out and feeling frantic about the debilitating pain returning.

I don't have a PCM, so I went to urgent care yesterday to request X-rays and a referral, which they very kind to do. They also ordered some blood work if I went the rheumatology route (the CBC looked normal except my MCHC was just below their cutoff at 33. My Hgb was normal). The rest was sent out to process, they only do CBC & BMP in house. 

On top of the back pain I am having all kinds of GI problems. Some are not new, and I have a gastroenterologist. Many things have fallen under the functional problem umbrella except I've been having issues emptying my bowels for the past 3 months. Like I can feel stool in my colon, but can't activate the muscles? It's hard to describe because enough coffee or moving will eventually make it happen, but it's crazy to feel it, know I need to poo and sit down and not be able to do anything. I am bloated 24/7 right now which is driving me crazy. 

We are moving duty stations at the end of July (OCUNUS) so I'm running out of time to chase any of this down. 

Relevant medical history: 
Hashimotos since 2011, on levothyroxine.
IBS-C. I've had a colonoscopy in 2011, HIDA scan and abdominal MRI for my liver/gall bladder clean in 22, recent endoscopy unremarkable besides chronic stomach inflammation. I just did an anal mammetry for my defecation issues, but won't have results for a couple weeks. I don't usually have hard stools for my constipation, just long bouts between going. 
Pelvic prolapse, grade 3 rectocele. 

I know my X-rays show a lot of gas in my system. I feel it üò≠ what I want to know, is can anyone see anything obviously wrong with my lower back? There is rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis in my family, but I myself haven't been diagnosed with it or ever had a spinal X-ray. I'll put mine in the comments below.

1kgbjee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bankruptcy/comments/1kgbjee/i_need_some_advice_on_our_situation_55k_in_credit/,"I need some advice on our situation, 55k in credit card debt...","Hello,
 
  I'm here looking for advice on what we should do. Please don't judge, we are trying to fix our issue but hit a bump in the road.

The last 5 years were rough, had a new baby right as things shut down for COVID. We racked up about $55k in credit card debt between my husband and I. We live pay check to pay check. We don't have any subscriptions besides like $20 a month in streaming with ads. We for months now don't pay extra for anything, no morning expensive coffee we barely even eat out except 1 time a week at McDonald's with coupons after my son's karate class.

Last August my credit cards were unaffordable, I signed up for a debt relief program. I cut up all cards and have been saving for what we want. I had 4 credit cards at 30k total when I sign up for debt relief. They were able to reduce payments, I got 2 out of my card negotiated by half. I got my 3rd offer & the chase doesn't want to negotiate the 10k and wants it paid in 6 months for $7,500 is left on it to pay. That would take my debt relief payments from 400 a month to $1600 a month. If we decline this it goes to court and we risk a lot. 

We both have zero credit cards to use, I have possibly found a loan but would put my car up as collateral. If we use our savings we lose everything we have saved and both cars need maintenance & I am on day 5 of me recovering from surgery. We could ask family members for a loan, but not sure if they could help us. 

My husband filed for his debt relief 2 months ago and cut up all his cards as well. We are at a point of, should we file for bankruptcy? We have a mortgage, we have lived in our home for 8.5 years. His car is paid off and mines paid off next September. This new debt offer is currently the issue & I'm not sure what we should do. We have until the 18th of May to decline or accept the offer. 

Please don't come at me, I already don't plan on getting credit cards after this as the last 8 months for me has shown we don't need them. I have learned my lesson, so please just advice on how to proceed. 

I run my own business and it's not always consistent, but it's enough for us. I work 6-7 days a week for months a time. Our child is homeschooled so we don't pay for child care. My husband has a full time job picking up overtime when they let him and doing Doordash to also help.

What is the best way to go?

Thank you for everyone helps.",1,1746555304.0,Bankruptcy,6,0.67,False
