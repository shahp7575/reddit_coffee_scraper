But everything got worse it feels like she lost all feelings towards me and even admits herself that it might be from hardwork, but really? I been through what she is going through but thats when we met.

Last day we were talking about if we could meet eachother in person if something changed she would text. But guess what she went with his guy friend in mac. Lets call him alex. This alex waits for him before every lecture buys her stuff like notebooks, etc.  When i tell her i feel insecure she literally dont gives a f just a guy bestfriend. I really want to believe that but meh... anyone would really do that to his friend? Such a treatment? When i ask if i was in her shoes she would be jealous too but im a guy and cant just buy some girl coffee or somethin.

Context:I (M25) matched with a stunning girl on Facebook Dating. She was one of the prettiest women I’ve ever seen. For context, I was using a dummy account with Elon Musk as the profile picture, which I only use for hookups. We chatted for a while, and I clearly stated that I was looking for a hookup but hinted that she might change my mind.  

We moved to Telegram and decided to meet for coffee or dinner. I initially thought she might be a catfish, but I took the risk. I picked her up at her university, and when I saw her in person, my heart was pounding—she was even more attractive.  

We went to SM, but after parking, she mentioned she couldn’t drink coffee and wasn’t hungry. We just sat in the parking lot for a few minutes. I asked her what she wanted to do, but she kept insisting I decide. I gave her several options: movies, bowling, a walk, or the beach, but she said she didn’t like crowded places. At this point, I was running out of ideas and was considering suggesting going to my place or a hotel. Before I could say anything, she finally suggested a samgyupsal place (which I had already mentioned earlier).  

The date went well overall. We talked for hours, and afterward, I dropped her off at her place. Once I got home, we texted briefly, and I shared my thoughts about the parking lot situation. I admitted I had considered taking her to my place or a hotel. Her response was, ""What the fuck?"" and she blocked me on all social media.  

Previous Attempts: I tried messaging her using my real account and calling her, but she blocked me immediately.

They turn no one away and even have open spots for beds and transportation to those beds every day. 

At this time of year, it is open every day, which makes it one of the only service spots that is.

When I contacted Kroger’s customer service to inquire, I learned they had been incorrectly charging the sweetened beverage tax for an unsweetened cold brew coffee I’ve been buying regularly for over a year. Here’s their response:

“According to our team, in Washington, beverages that are unsweetened should not be taxed. We sincerely apologize for this mistake and assure you that we are working to evaluate and update the sub-commodity values to prevent this from happening again.” They credited me $1.

However, two weeks later, I bought the same product and was charged the tax again. It’s clear the issue hasn’t been fixed, and they’re still incorrectly taxing this product—and possibly others. From what I understand, this tax isn’t being passed down by the distributor, yet Kroger continues to pass it on to consumers.

Given Kroger’s ongoing lawsuits over alleged price gouging and pocketing consumer money, this feels like a potential red flag. Their lack of urgency to resolve the issue or refund other affected customers is a bit concerning.

1. Master Your Time: Prioritize like a pro. Focus on what moves the needle—whether it’s client outreach, refining your offers, or building systems. Use time-blocking and treat your personal time as non-negotiable to avoid burnout.

2. Build Genuine Connections: Your network is your net worth. Show up authentically on social platforms, in communities, and with potential clients. Consistency builds trust, and trust builds your business.

4. Invest in Your Growth: Whether it’s coaching, courses, or tools that save you time, treat these as stepping stones, not expenses. The ROI on clarity and efficiency is priceless.

5. Track Your Wins and Learn from Losses: Celebrate even the small victories—they add up. And when something doesn’t work, look at it as a lesson, not a failure. Adjust and keep moving forward.

1hbdbug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hbdbug/vvs2_diamonds_key_notes_and_expert_tips_for/,VVS2 Diamonds: Key Notes and Expert Tips for Diamond Buyers,"VVS2 diamonds represent the entry point to luxury-grade clarity and are considered “almost perfect.” Their prices range from $2,150 to $12,500 per carat, depending on the combination of the 4c’s. Market analysis indicates these stones comprise the top 1% of all diamond production, creating inherent value stability through their natural rarity.

Investment tracking shows VVS2 diamonds commanding a 10%-30% premium over VS1 grades while offering virtually identical visual characteristics, with expert gemologists able to distinguish between them only under 10x-40x magnification. 

This guide provides smart strategies for navigating the VVS2 market, including investment considerations and expert methodologies for picking the best diamond within your budget.

# Bottom Line

VVS2 diamonds offer exceptional clarity with inclusions nearly impossible to detect without magnification. Here's what you need to know:

* Outstanding clarity that's eye-clean and virtually flawless
* Balanced option between top-tier clarity and more budget-friendly choices
* Ideal for larger stones (2+ carats) or step-cut shapes prone to showing inclusions
* Maintain better resale value due to their rarity and quality
* Potential for savings by considering slightly lower clarity grades like VS1 without sacrificing visible quality
* For lab-grown diamond buyers, VVS2 diamonds are an ideal choice since the price per carat is very affordable.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Buyers seeking high-quality diamonds with excellent clarity
* Those interested in investment pieces that retain value
* Shoppers looking for larger diamonds or step-cut shapes

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious buyers prioritize size over clarity.
* Those who may not appreciate subtle differences in diamond grading

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Compare with slightly lower clarity grades (VS1, VS2) to assess value
2. Focus on eye cleanliness rather than just the grade
3. Consider the diamond's shape and size when deciding on clarity
4. Use high-quality imaging tools to inspect diamonds closely
5. Balance clarity with other factors like cut and color for overall quality
6. Consult with an expert to make sure you get a good price for the diamond.

# FAQ

Q: What does VVS2 mean?  
A: VVS2 stands for ""Very Very Slightly Included 2,"" indicating minute inclusions difficult to see under 10x magnification.

Q: Are VVS2 diamonds worth the investment?  
A: It depends on your priorities. They offer exceptional quality but can be pricier than lower clarity grades that still appear eye-clean.

Q: How do VVS2 diamonds compare in price?  
A: A 1-carat round VVS2 diamond typically costs between $5,600 to $7,000, while 2-carat stones can exceed $17,000.

Q: Can I see inclusions in a VVS2 diamond?  
A: Inclusions in VVS2 diamonds are generally not visible to the naked eye and are difficult for even skilled graders to see under magnification.

Q: Do VVS2 diamonds sparkle more?  
A: Clarity doesn't significantly impact sparkle. Cut quality is the primary factor affecting a diamond's brilliance and fire.

Remember, while VVS2 diamonds offer exceptional clarity, it's crucial to balance all aspects of diamond quality within your budget for the best overall value and appearance.

Some people will say it's a mistake, others will say it's totally possible... I think it is possible, but with some very crucial considerations:

-Do you think of them as a friend, or do you think of them as someone you absolutely need to keep close? If you are still deeply missing them and jump into friendship just to keep them in your life as a ""special someone"", that's not friendship. Friendship is not a lifeline for lost love. Put some distance first, focus on moving on, take time to heal, and only then reach them for friendship. DON'T rush it. 

-One of the side effects of staying friends too soon, is that you become paranoid. Are they seeing someone? Are they really your friend or do they just pretend? Am I a good friend? Should I try harder? Will they get tired of me and hang out with soneone else? Will they stop sharing with me? etc. I don't need to tell you what's going on here. If you are in this mental state, then you are not ready for a genuine and healthy friendship. 

-Do they want to be your friend? If they don't, or if they pretend they do but act cold and distant, then you must let go. Friendships, as romantic relationships, cannot be one sided. I know it feels like double breakup, but it's for the best.

-Communication is key. If both of you are certain you want to be friends (like friends friends, not just acquaitances) then talk about how you will do it. How often you will see each other, if you can handle being alone or you'd rather start by going to social events with more people. Do some checkups on how you are. Set some rules: if one of you still has feelings that make the friendship complicated, put distance for a while. Also, decide how you are going to communicate if you start dating someone, etc. 

-Be aware that there's limits to what you owe each other. Even if you remain close friends, you have to respect the other's life. You might give each other some updates while the breakup is still fresh, but at some point you must draw a line and make clear that you aren't entitled to more courtesy than any other friend.

I know it's tempting to try to keep them in your life somehow, and friendship is the closest thing you can think of. But if it's a way to cover your lingering romantic feelings, or if its onesided, you are clinging into an illusion, and eventually it will harm you and break your heart again. So be brutally honest with them and yourself. That said, if you take your time, put some distance first, and both of you are 100% sure about being friends, then it's possible. I myself am good friends with my ex, in part because we were already friends before dating and both decided to keep the friendship if we ever broke up. And it was hard at first, for me especially. We went no contact for some weeks, then started to talk a bit, then a bit more, then we went out a couple of times for a coffee, started sending memes and doing casual talk again... Today he told me he's dating someone, and while a bit sad on the spot, I feel fine and happy for him. I don't know if things will ever be exactly the same. Most likely not. I care about him and want him in my life, but I don't fool myself into believing that I could go to his house right now and feel nothing, or that I will be able to hang out with him and his girlfriend in the near future. These things take time. I am trying, but at least I know that if it becomes unbearable, I will be mentally strong to cut loose, for both our sakes.

I was scheduled for a Full Day at a 7:30am school.  I show up, get my assignment, go to the classroom, AAAANNNNDDDDD.... the teacher was there.

""Oh Hi I'm the substitute assigned to your room today.""

Teacher:  ""Oh that's great!  Say, *I don't leave for the field trip until 10am*.  Just come back at that time.""  (I didn't know the Teacher was doing a field trip).

So I go to the Teacher's Lounge to kill 2.5 hours.  I'm also thinking, *""Office is gonna have me cover for someone else... no way they'll just let me sit here that long.""*

TWO and HALF HOURS LATER... I've watched like 30 YT videos, witnessed two teachers argue over the printer, read about 45 pages of the book I brought, finished four cups of coffee, and took a 30 minute nap during it all.  Staff was coming in to heat up their lunches.

I go up to the class at 10.  The doors open, but the class is empty.  I sit down and see the note the teacher left.

""10am is Prep.  11:15 is lunch.  Next class is at 12:00.""

**Took another 2 hour nap.**

12:00 comes around.  I'm actually looking forward to having students in the classroom.  THREE KIDS SHOW UP.

""Oh the other students are on the field trip with the Teacher.""

The class ends at 1:15, but I'm also supposed to watch the last class that goes until 2:39.  However, at 1:00p (15 minutes before the first class ended), the Teacher and the rest of the students came back from their field trip.  I'm dismissed from my duties.

However, I don't want to tell the office, because they might assign me to cover someone's last period.

I just go to the Teacher's Lounge again and slept until 2:39.

1hbd4l8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbd4l8,"8 weeks Vs. 4 years, and Rant About Tundra’s “Breeders”","This is my sweet boy Tundra at 8 weeks old versus him now at 4 years old. Unfortunately because he was used as a stud for the first 2.5 years of his life (once he was mature enough in the area to be a stud) before I adopted him last summer at 2.5 years old. I seriously adore my sweet, handsome Tundra so much and he truly is my forever boy. And the middle picture of my sweet boy is the first ever picture I ever saw of him. Initially I thought I wanted a Great Dane or English Mastiff. But as soon as I saw that first picture of Tundra though, I just knew immediately that he was my best friend and soul boy. A week and $100 later, Tundra pulled off of his leash (he sped towards me so fast they the breeder unintentionally let go of his leash on her end) and immediately jumped in my arms with the biggest smile on his face, and giving me kisses. Plus cuddling up into my lap immediately once we were settled in the car to go home too. It was almost like he knew immediately to that I was his human just like I knew he was my boy. Though the only heartbreaking thing about his adoption was that the “breeder” has made claims about him that were way of made from being true about Tundra. The 2 big ones bring that he would “chase goats, cats, and other livestock type animals” which is far from the case. I’ve adopted a number of cats since adopting Tundra, and he’s outright bones with one of said cats (and this is the only time he does this, but has nipped at other dogs that he felt they were getting too close to his cat buddy Midnight). And have taken Tundra through petting zoos at both pumpkin patches and Christmas tree farms both fall and winter season I’ve had him so far, and never one has tried to go after them. The most I’ve seen Tundra do is try to give kisses to the livestock animals through the metal fence. Plus the other big one they described was him supposedly being “food aggressive” but the thing is, even from the day my mama and I brought him home, both of us have been able to feed him from our hands without any issue, and never has issues eating around the cats or other 2 puppies I have. And one of the things that made me most upset with “breeders” was that they ouright told us that if we had “issues with Tundra then it was OUR responsibility to either take him to a shelter or rehome him ourselves. Because they were retiring from breeding, and some Tundra was the last dog they had to adopt out, they weren’t going to deal with rehoming him if it didn’t work out with us”. Like hello, you’re supposedly one of the best pomsky breeders in my area, and this is how you’re treating the poor dog? And the most wild thing to me though, the breeders had asked that I periodically send updates. And of course I have been. The biggest one being that my sweet boy has developed epilepsy (he started having seizures last December, and was fully diagnosed June of this year). And naturally I brought it up to the breeders. Because you know, they had him as a stud, it was important for me to have said something to them, just in case one of his pups developed epileptic seizures too, then they way people that would have adopted his babies have a heads up to just keep their eyes out just in case something happened to Tundra babies. And the breeders tried blaming me for the seizures trying to claim that chocolate or caffeine can cause seizures in dogs. Like 1, I’m EpiPen and anaphylactic shock level allergic to chocolate, plus having 3 dogs on top of that, my mama and I genuinely don’t keep chocolate in the house. And having cats that like to climb onto things, we keep all caffeinated beverages like coffee and energy drinks in cups with lids so that way if something got knocked over, then there wouldn’t be spillage, or minimal spillage. So we know for certain that his seizures weren’t caused by either chocolate or caffeine. And the breeder didn’t like that at least for our situation with Tundra’s seizures, we were able to disprove easily that both were so easily disproved. And hasn’t responded to any of my update texts since June. And don’t get me wrong, I absolutely know and understand that chocolate and caffeine can be absolutely beyond toxic to animals. But just the way they have described Tundra, and how they’ve interacted with me since, they seriously have me wondering how reputable these “breeders” truly were. ",6,1733866885.0,Pomsky,0,1.0,False

The actual collection doesn't have much do to with Rook/Lucanis but they are present and I wrote this really fun scene of Rook, Lucanis, Spite and Viago having coffee and I thought I'd share it! I also included the part where Rook invited him because there's really funny line about Spite in there, and I gotta give my boy Spite some love.  This takes place a year after Veilguard ends. Enjoy!

  
P.S. Keep in mind this is not edited and may have mistakes. I'm still working on this and haven't posted it to AO3 yet =)

  
\~\~\~

  
It had been a few weeks now since Viago had chased their mysterious thief across Treviso. Caterina had been oddly calm, despite the report he had given her about what had happened. She had been satisfied in the return of the package, a red lyrium item that they had heard rumbles about. Red lyrium was not needed in the already chaotic political environment. After the governor had tried taking over and the Antaam had been driven out, things had been relatively calm on the surface. It had been a year since Rook had earned his moniker “God-killer” but those in the know were aware that people like the Venatori and Antaam were still around. Small pockets that were trying to rebuild after the defeat of their gods.



Like Viago had predicted, Caterina put him in charge of tracking down the man who had played with them, twice, and lived. He didn’t have much to go on, but Lucanis and Rook had come back a few days prior and were briefed about everything. It had been a stroke of luck that Rook had been visiting him in his office and saw the drawing of the crow sitting out on his desk.



“What’s this?” Rook inquired, picking it up and inspecting it.



“A symbol that our mystery man carved on D’Martes' body. I think it was to mock us.” Viago grumbled, still sore about the whole thing. Rook had an odd look on his face. “What?”



“I think I’ve seen this before,” he confessed. That interested Viago. 



“Where?” 



“I’m…not sure.” he said slowly, thinking. “Are you sure this was an isolated incident?”



“What, you mean you think he’s done this before?” Viago questioned, arms crossed as he thought.



“Maybe?” the mage took a blank paper and copied the symbol. “I’m no investigator, but I know a good one.” he said smirking.



“Doesn’t she work out of Minrathous only?” Viago doubted she’d have much insight, or time, now that she was more famous than previously. Being labeled a Hero of the Veilguard will have that effect. 



“Yeah, but she thinks critically and sees things I don’t. I’m sure she’d be happy to help a friend.” He stashed the paper in his pocket.



“I appreciate it, Rook.”



“Hey, anything for family.” he said with a smile. How Rook kept his sanity and positive outlook after everything he went through would be a mystery to Viago. Though he suspected it had something to do with how he wielded his sense of humor like he did his lightning bolts. He had seen Rook talk circles around a guy until the guy ended up apologizing even though Rook had started the fight; it was a spectacle to witness. No wonder Lucanis had fallen for him in such a short time. And his demon. Spite was feral about Rook, it was terrifying. 



“What did you come here for originally?” Viago asked, cleaning his desk space.



“Oh. Lucanis, Spite and I are going to get coffee later and wanted to know if you wanted to join us.” Viago gave Rook a genuine smile filled with warmth.



“Thank you, I’d love to.” he said sincerely. He really did like Rook, after everything he did for the Crows and Treviso it was satisfying to know that he had joined the family, too.

\~

  
Viago sat at Cafe Pietra, across from an empty chair. Though, he supposed it wasn’t empty, he just couldn’t see Spite. How Rook could Viago didn’t know. He tried explaining it once but he backed out when Rook started theorizing that he thought it might have something to do with how their bond had changed after Rook and Lucanis had “physically” connected. He did not want to hear about their sex life in any capacity, especially not one that involved a demon, which was still something he hadn’t wrapped his head around. Viago remembers the wasted coffee that day as Rook had waited until he took a sip to drop the bombshell that Lucanis and Spite had *very* different demeanors in the bedroom. He still mourned the loss.



“I wrote that letter to Neve, it was sent out earlier today.”



“Which way did you send it?” Viago asked.



“The fast way.” Lucanis commented, giving the empty chair a look.“No, you cannot eat the cups. They are porcelain, and I’m tired of having to pay for them.” Rook stifled a smile as *poked* at the air and met resistance that wasn't there visually. Viago would never understand magic, and he didn’t want to. 

Spirit mail was enough of a headache, but he used it because it was useful and the crossroads were just sitting there, not being used. Might as well use it to their advantage. Not to mention that the wisps didn’t stop following Neve, even after she left the fade. Rook said she complains, but she does like using them to get her mailed delivered.  


“Behave,” he told Spite. “You know Lucanis missed the coffee while we were away. The south has terrible coffee, by the way.” He told Viago, Apparently that did the trick as Lucanis shook his head.



“He always listens to you. It would be vexing if I didn’t appreciate that he listens to *somebody*.” Lucanis sighed and took a sip of his cup. Rook got a sly look on his face as he said, with all the filth one could muster.



“He listened to you last night, didn’t he?.” Lucanis choked on his coffee and went red as he coughed, giving Rook a pained look that he couldn’t hold long because he could never look at that man without making moon eyes at him. Viago buried his face in his coffee cup with a long suffering sigh.



“Rook…” Lucanis pleaded and then gestured in his direction. “Viago is sitting right there.” The mage laughed at that and threaded his fingers with his husbands across the table in apology.



“Sorry, sorry.” he smiled and Lucanis’ distress melted into a sappy look. Viago couldn’t even be mad because they both looked so fucking happy and lovesick. He was sure the demon was probably making eyes at Rook too, he would even bet money on it.



“How was the honeymoon?” he asked, since they were already close to that topic.



“It was hot, because of course it's Southern Thedas. Most of it is still recovering.” Rook said a little sad. “We got lucky, the damage we sustained is nothing compared to the tide of darkspawn that destroyed most of the South.”



“Though the efforts to fix it are going well. Val Royeaux was in decent shape as they’ve been working on refortifying the structures there. And the more rural villages were constructed pretty quickly given that they were all made of wood and basic stone.” Lucanis added, he ordered another coffee when the server walked by.



“We did go and see some Wyverns.” Rook grinned at how Lucanis lit up like a beacon.



“They had so many colors and sizes, and I even got some leftover fangs that they shed. I think it’ll make a decent blade. Some of them are still venomous even after they’ve been shed.” Viago chuckled. Trust Lucanis to go shopping for materials on his honeymoon. Once a Crow, always a crow.



“I think the most fun was watching people shriek anytime Spite popped his wings out.” Rook commented demurely. Lucanis sighed and stared at him.



“That’s because you kept telling him to do it whenever anyone who looked like an ex-Templar or chantry sister was around.” Rook cackled with glee at his husband’s long suffering tone.



“It was Spite’s trip too. We agreed no full-possession in public for obvious reasons, but he needed to be able to spend time with both of us.” Lucanis and Rook both looked at Spite and smiled at something he said. Viago couldn’t help but chuckle into his cup, he could only imagine the chaos they had sown. Rook was enough on his own but Spite always made it worse, and Lucanis couldn't say no to either of them.



“How did you end up explaining that?”



“Fade magic bullshit."" Rook waved his hand, ""We told them Lucanis was a mage of unusual talent. ""



""And that worked?"" Viago asked incredulous.



""The Inquisitor backed us up the first time it happened, and word spread from there. Though her husband looked like he ate a lemon anytime he saw Lucanis.” Rook shrugged.



“Given that Cullen had been knight-commander, I can’t imagine why.” Lucanis said dryly.



“The Inquisitor thought it was hysterical. She had me tell Spite to do it in front of this one crazy blonde elf that’s a friend of hers. She jumped out of her skin and ran away so fast, yelling about how she can’t stick an arrow in wings that aren’t even there.” Even Lucanis laughed at that one. 



“I’m glad you got to relax for a change. No Dragons breathing down on you.” Viago told him.



“Or corrupt gods.” Lucanis added.



“I’ll drink to that.” Rook agreed. 



This was nice, Viago often focused on his work, to the point where he forgot to do normal human things. Spending time with his family was probably one of his favorite things to do, but especially with Rook and Lucanis because they didn’t judge him when he blatantly tested his food and drink for poison every time they went out somewhere.



“Viago!” A Crow approached their table and all three of them looked alert because he seemed in a hurry. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but Caterina sent me. Said it was urgent.” He handed a missive to the older Crow who thanked him and read it quickly.



“Apparently, there is a Venatori warehouse that we had been hearing whispers about, and there is more of those red lyrium items in it. They finally got a location.” Rook and Lucanis looked at each other before draining their coffee.



“It's been a while since I was able to electrocute a Venatori."" Rook said good naturedly.

""If it’s nearby we cant just go straight there, the four of us should be enough.” Lucanis agreed, kissing Rook's hand. Viago nodded. He swore that fighting together was as much foreplay for them as the stuff they did behind closed doors.



“The quicker the better, we don’t need any stragglers from the Venatori regrouping in Treviso.”

1hbd1cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRPcharts/comments/1hbd1cm/chatgpts_price_prediction/,ChatGPT's Price Prediction,"I had Chat GPT's most recent model analyze XRP's 4-hour chart. 

Here is its response:

"" This 4-hour chart depicts a cryptocurrency that surged to a local high of around $2.90 before experiencing a corrective pullback, suggesting that initial euphoria gave way to profit-taking and uncertainty. 

Since that peak, price action has been oscillating in a broad consolidation range, with signs of buyers stepping in near the low-$2 area to support the trend. 

The upward structure remains largely intact, as the asset is still trading well above prior swing lows established during earlier accumulation phases. Technical indicators and volume profiles hint at ongoing accumulation rather than outright distribution. 

Going into January, if the price can hold above recently tested supports (e.g., $2.10–$2.20) and break through short-term resistance around $2.50–$2.60 with convincing volume, it would signal renewed bullish intent. 

Under these conditions, a return toward—and potentially beyond—the previous $2.90 high seems plausible, with the next logical resistance zone emerging around $3.20–$3.40. This target area aligns with key Fibonacci extension levels of the prior bullish leg and serves as a psychologically significant round-number threshold, making it a credible upside objective should the current consolidation resolve favorably. ""

  
TLDR: 

The price rocketed to $2.90 like a hyper-caffeinated squirrel, slammed the brakes at $2.11 for a coffee break, and now it’s either blasting off toward $3.40 or wiping out harder than a drunk unicyclist.

SCP-XXXX - The Unraveling Sage (Anomaly of Deterministic Perception)

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-XXXX is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell furnished with minimalistic, non-sentimental items. Interaction with SCP-XXXX is limited to interviews conducted by personnel with Level-3 clearance or higher. No objects bearing text, symbols, or visual media that could be interpreted as ""prophetic"" or ""fateful"" are to be introduced into its containment area. Requests for paper, writing utensils, or any recording devices are to be denied.

Description:
SCP-XXXX is a humanoid male, approximately 47 years old, with the appearance of an unkempt vagrant. It claims to have achieved a state of ""Universal Sight,"" a condition it refers to as ""the Mind and Eyes of the Divine,"" allowing it to perceive the deterministic ""equation of fate"" governing all matter and motion. This ""sight"" grants SCP-XXXX the ability to predict future events with unsettling accuracy, though it cannot alter the events it foretells.

SCP-XXXX's predictions are always presented in abstract, poetic riddles or ""equations"" that, when decoded, describe future events with a high degree of precision. These events range from minor personal occurrences (e.g., a researcher spilling coffee) to major global incidents (e.g., natural disasters, geopolitical shifts). SCP-XXXX claims it does not ""predict"" in the conventional sense but rather ""remembers"" events as if they have already occurred.

Anomalous Effect:
The predictions provided by SCP-XXXX have a profound psychological impact on those who hear them. Subjects who receive a prediction experience an increased belief in the concept of fate, often leading to existential crises, depressive episodes, or delusions of ""inevitability."" This has been classified as ""Deterministic Contagion Syndrome"" (DCS). Prolonged exposure results in subjects adopting a fatalistic outlook, sometimes resigning from their jobs or refusing to make daily choices, believing all actions are preordained.

Addendum XXXX-1:
SCP-XXXX refers to an entity or concept it calls the ""Tyrannical Cabal"" (TC), which it describes as an aspect of reality's ""playbook"" designed to obscure the nature of determinism. It claims that concepts like ""free will"" and ""evil"" are false constructs imposed by the TC to keep humanity from perceiving the truth of interconnected existence. SCP-XXXX frequently warns that those who continue to believe in the ""duality of good and evil"" are ""trapped in the moat of Heaven, where patience is a raft few build.""

Interview Log XXXX-A
Dr. Lyons: SCP-XXXX, can you tell me why you believe you can ""see the script"" of reality?
SCP-XXXX: ""There is no script, doctor. There is only the motion of motion. It sings the same song, but you hear it as chaos. You wish to write your own line, but you are a note in the measure, never the composer.""
Dr. Lyons: So you’re saying you have no control over your own actions either?
SCP-XXXX: ""Control? A leaf does not steer the wind, but the wind was always its breath. I breathe as you do, Doctor, though you think your breath is your own.""

Discovery:
SCP-XXXX was discovered after local authorities in Victoria, British Columbia, reported a man claiming to ""unravel all delusions of free will"" while distributing leaflets titled ""The Right to Sleep"" and ""The End of Money is the Beginning of Truth."" Several bystanders noted that events described on the leaflets (a fire at a nearby factory, the collapse of a bridge, and the exact resignation date of a local councilman) occurred as foretold. Upon containment, SCP-XXXX refused to provide its name, only stating, ""I am the whisper that remembers.""",1,1733866536.0,diviningai,0,1.0,False

Me? I'm just searching for a partner in crime who's as passionate about life as she is about her dreams.

Picture this: *Stolen glances over steaming coffee, spontaneous weekend adventures, sharing those moments where the world seems to pause just for us. I'm not just looking for a relationship, but a partnership that feels like coming home.*

My World:
- IT professional with a wanderlust spirit
- Roots in Europe and a heart in Moscow
- Music lover who finds poetry in everything from Kendrick to Coldplay, from Swift to Rammstein.
- Dreamer with plans to grow, learn, and create something meaningful

I'm in a transitional phase - planning to return to uni, expanding my skills, and exploring ways to contribute meaningfully to the world. My ideal partner would be someone who understands that life isn't about having all the answers, but about being willing to ask the right questions.

What I'm Dreaming Of:
- A connection that feels effortless yet profound, the type of love that challenges and supports in equal measure
- A partner under 30, based in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or Central/Eastern Europe (with a soft spot for Poland, but open to other countries)
- Have a spark of passion for something that makes your eyes light up
Someone who sees the world with wonder and depth
- A partner to build dreams with - in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or across Central/Eastern Europe

I'm not interested in surface-level, temporary interactions. I want to understand your dreams, fears, hopes - and share mine in return. Someone who can sit in comfortable silence, challenge my perspectives, and walk beside me as we both evolve.
Bonus points if you can recommend a book that changed your worldview, or share a dream that keeps you awake at night.

1hbcqp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hbcqp6/aitah_and_overreacting_to_how_husband_treats/,AITAH and overreacting to how husband treats daughter?,"My husband (47) and I (47f) have been together since my daughter was 5. She’s now 16. He’s a selective germaphobe (ex: won’t eat out of anything that’s communal like a chip bowl, but is fine drinking straight from the cup in restaurants). My daughter, growing up around his comments, has become a germaphobe as well but takes it a little more seriously (utensils can’t touch table in restaurants, requires a straw, wears gloves when doing dishes). She takes the outside trash bins to and from the street as part of chores. She doesn’t like touching the bins so she uses a paper towel when she does this. Yesterday when she did that, husband tells her she needs to stop with the paper towel, it doesn’t make any sense because she doesn’t need one when she opens the car door and what’s the difference, and she needs to think before wasting money like that. When she walked away, I told him it shouldn’t be a big deal. She uses 2 paper towels a week, about a half a roll of paper towels a year for this, so what. He said I’m coddling her by allowing her to do this. I said I do say something when it matters, but this is just not-picky over something inconsequential. Despite wasting 2 paper towels a week, she’s very conscientious about not wasting money, especially for a teenager. She won’t even ask about school trips or things she wants to do if she feels like they’re too expensive. I had to beg her to let me buy her prom dress instead of using the money she’s saved.  For context, we are financially secure so it’s not that we can’t afford these things. That’s not the issue in either side. He thinks she’s being inconsiderate and she doesn’t like when people spend money on her. 

He then brought up a situation from last week when she dropped her toothbrush head in the bathroom sink. She went to get a replacement out of the cabinet and he said no, that was unacceptable and to just rinse that one off. She had already thrown it away so she got the replacement but he was not happy and told her don’t do it again. When he brought it back up, I told him I would’ve gotten a new one too! The sink is disgusting in between cleanings, and I’m not a germaphobe. But it will have his boogers (he says they’re not boogers but stuff that he coughs up - still gross! And they look like boogers!), bits of his facial hair, dried toothpaste, fuzz, etc. Noooo way I’m just ‘rinsing 
that off’. 

Couple hours later he & I are driving back home from getting groceries. Daughter texts and says she took the golf cart out earlier and can’t remember if she turned the key to off, can we stop at the shop and check on our way in (it’s about 50 yds from the house). Husband says, well it doesn’t matter because nothing runs on it unless the gas pedal is pushed, but if she’s that worried about it she can walk back up there and check it herself. (If roles were reversed, he’d def expect her to check for him). I said we’re driving right by it, what’s the big deal?! He said, we’ll have to stop, open the door (automatic opener), you’ll have to get out… I just put my hand up and said whatever. He ended up stopping because he knew I was aggravated, and it took all of maybe 30 seconds.  

We’re putting groceries away (daughter is helping) and they start talking about coffee. She said she hasn’t been making it in the mornings because she doesn’t have time. His response was, oh you have time because you sit in your room and do nothing for 15 minutes before you even come out here. Instantly negative. He doesn’t know she’s ‘doing nothing’.  Why always with the negative assumptions?

She’s an excellent kid. Great grades, very strong moral compass. She’s given us no reason to expect anything negative from her, other than the occasional attitude check (which usually comes out when he’s getting onto her like this). 

I grew up with a step-dad that was hypocritical, manipulative, and pretty harsh on me, even though I was a good kid. It was rough and caused some serious self-confidence issues. I don’t want her to feel that way or go through what I went through. So I know I’m super sensitive about this type of stuff. But I feel like he’s unnecessarily nit-picking every small thing he can and not acknowledging the good stuff unless it’s huge, like her induction to national honors society. He’s also bad with empathy and talking condescendingly, that goes for anyone. So I know it’s part of his personality, but we’ve had multiple conversations about it. She will occasionally come to me in tears because of the way he talks to her, she’s felt in the past he doesn’t even like her. 1-2 times a year I’ll have us all sit down and talk it out. It will get better for a bit, but always goes back to this. 

So do you think I’m the AH for getting angry at these things and allowing my past to make me too sensitive and blowing this out of proportion? Or is it actually messed up and I’m justified in my anger and defensiveness of her? Please help me get some clarity here. ",4,1733865893.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

How can I deal with this without causing any more harm to either of us?,"TL;DR. I (m28) developed feelings for a close friend (f22). She was in a relationship that hasn't gone well for a long time. I told her that I liked her and she ended that relationship. We were together for a short time and it went really well. Then her ex (m26) told her things would be different and she decided to give him another chance. We are still on speaking terms and have a shared friend group but we don't really talk anymore. All of that was half a year ago. Everytime I feel like I am getting over it I start missing her soon after.

Thi is going to be a very long post. Sry, but I feel the details are important.

I have known this friend for several years, but we weren't very close. After I moved  to a new appartement near her, we started to hang out much more often and started to get to know each other on a much more personal level. About after a year or so, I started to develop feelings for her. 

However, she was in a committed long-distance relationship. That relationship hasn't been going well for a long time. For months she would mostly talk about how unhappy she is with it.

By February we started to spend a lot more time together. She would start mentioning how she can't see a future with her bf (m26). One evening early in March after we've been to a bar with friends, we talked about how we share a lot of values for how a relationship should go, and how similar we are. (She later told me that by that point she was absolutely sure that I liked her.) After that night she initiated much more contact and the way she looked at me changed. I also started to really fall for her.

She basically annouced to me, that she would break up with her bf next time she visits him. But then she didn't. I thought they somehow fixed their relationship. However, she still sought out a lot of contact with me. We would spend hours just talking into the middle of the night several times a week. 

I was confused but already emotionally invested. I wanted clarity. So at the beginning of April, I told her how I felt, fully expecting to be rejected. She told me she already knew that I liked her for quite some time but was certain since that night in March. She wanted to breakup with her bf a few weeks prior, but just couldn't muster the courage. She was glad that I finally told her and she wanted to keep seeing me. She couldn't tell me how she felt that moment, but she refused to leave my appartement telling me she enjoys the moment too much, even though it was the middle of the night and she had to work in the morning.

After that we started spending every free minute with each other. We talked about intimate topics such as childhood trauma and past relationships. She didn't feel comfortable yet getting too physical yet as she was technically still in a relationship, but we would spend every other night just sitting in grass in the woods or on my couch cuddeling and talking until the late night. Hpurs passed like minutes.

At the end if April, she finally ended her relationship. She told me she wouldn't have had the courage to do so without me, and she is happier for it. From there on we really kicked things off. She kept telling me things like I am evrything she would have ever wanted from a relationship, no one ever treated her so well, it means the world to her when I tell her nice things and she feels appreciated for the first time in her life.

She told me she isn't comfortable to call it a relationship yet as she literally just came out of a long term relationship, but she really likes me and she wants to see where things are going, as long as we take it slow.

That was the happiest time of my life. For the first time in probably 20 years I was really happy. Pretty quickly, I was absolutely in love with her.

On thursday the 30th of May her Ex reached out to her via WhatsApp telling her how much she means to him, but not adressing any of the problems. We talked about it for a couple hours and of course she was disturbed by that message, but after we talked about it she seemingly felt a lot better and told me as much. She told me she is done with that relationship and I had nothing to worry about.

The next morning (friday) we wanted to sleep in. We were staying at my place so I made her coffee and went to the backery to get breakfast while she wanted to lounge about in bed for a while longer. She then called me, her Ex made the trip to our city and is waiting in front of her door (her parents place). He wanted to talk to her.

I rushed home. We talked for a solid 15 minutes. She reassured me what she said the night before. She just wants to end things on good terms with him and maybe remain friends. I had nothing to worry about. Thing between us is going well and she is starting to feel comfortable to call it a relationship soon.

I was invited to dinner at her (and her parents place) that day. However she aksed me if we can postpone, as she needed more time to talk things out with her ex. Once again reassuring that she is done with him.

I kept checking in on her over the next few days offering to bring her something to eat or just go for a walk or take her mind off things. She refused saying she isn't feeling well and needs some alone time. 

On Wednesday I offered to take her for a walk in the woods, which she usually loved. She texted me, yeah galdly, if her ex can come too. That hit me like a sucker punch. 

Apparently, he was with her all those days. I ask her to tell me what the hell is going on. 

She told me he wants to change and she wants to give him another chance. At least than she has fought for it. (After two years in which he has neglected her). She sees me as a good friend though.

I didn't take that well. She turned her phone off but during that night I lost it. I wrote walls of text begging her to just talk to me, followed by more messages expaining that I never want to see her again. Circling back to wanting to talk to her.

Long story short. I wrote a lot of thing I wish I could have kept for myself. So did she. We talked about some of it in person the next few days. I told her I loved her in that first conversation. However she couldn't really tell me why she made her decision. She couldn't really explain it to me. She told me she can't put it into words, but she feels like that's what she has to do. She just wasn't over her last relationship yet.

She told me that I was just a friend to her, and I just took her friendliness the wrong way. She just went along with me because she wasn't feeling well and she didn't know what she was feeling, but for the most part I was just impulsivity to her.

I didn't quite belive that, but she kept insisting that thats how she felt. It didn't feel like the truth to me, but she kept insisting that that whole thing was too traumatic and she can't talk with me about it. 

I let it slide, because both of us wanted to remain friends. I told her how important it is to me that we talk about it soon, once she feels better. That I don't want to swallow all of that for nothing, just to so we become strangers in a few months. That was late in June. We still met regularly in that time, about twice a week.

By mid July she basically stopped interacting with me for the most part. Almost no responds to memes or reels on instagram. And for the most part when I suggested meeting, she was too busy, too stressed, forgot or wasn't feeling like it. Telling me she is currently only seeing her close friends. (Which I thought we were up until this point.)

We kept seeing each other every few weeks since then. Not really intentionally. Mostly due to shared friends and hobbies.

It was important to her, that as few people as possible of our shared friends knew that we were together.

By now I wanted to seriously start dating again. I felt ready. By coincidence I found a friend of her on hinge and we matched.(that particular friend wasn't in the picture as far as I know.)

I asked that match on a date, but she told me she only likes me as a friend and it wouldn't be ok to go on a date with me due to her being close friends with the girl this post is about.

At first I thought... oh ok. What gives. But it has pulled me right back into that headspace wondering what that even was. Why would my friend/situationship mind if I was dating one of here friends if I was nothing but impulsivity to her? Why did that friend even know about it, when before it was important to her to keep it quiet. She made it very clear she didn't have any romantic feelings for me and I was just a friend, so why would her friends see it differently?

I want to get out of this spiral, but I keep falling back into that pattern of wondering what happend. Was I really that delusional? Or was I lied to when she told me it was nothing to her?

I'm just confused. I don't miss her directly I think. I miss how I felt with her and what I envisioned with her. The months after that situationship were by far the worst time of my life (and as I had to srruggle with mental health for my entire life, that means something). But the time with her was the happiest I felt in a lifetime.

There is a very specific reason why I can't entirely break ties and burn bridges (which probably would do me well), but I don't feel comfortable sharing that circumstance here. 

How do I get over it? Or should I risk trying to talk to her about it again? I just want to get on with my life already, but I just can't get her out of my head. I don't know if I actually miss her, or if I idolize her, or if I simply miss the way she made me feel.

I am at the end of my wits here.

One of the baristas there is a middle aged lady who always smiles at me. I noticed last week she was wearing a cool black+white striped apron instead of the uniform ones for the coffee shop so I told her ""I like your apron"". She got really excited and pulled out a stack of like 4 more aprons, all different patterns of black and white (like stripes, polka dots, checkers etc). She was telling me that some people don't like her style and even her house is all black+white. Well anyway I told her whatever makes her happy is the right thing haha.

Anyway this week I was heading to the same coffee shop and for some reason this lady pops into my head. As I'm putting on my scarf I see a black+white zig zag scarf in my closet that I used to love but I haven't worn it in ages. So I'm thinking this lady will probably take it off my hands.

Well I order my coffee and give it to her and she starts CRYING and comes around the counter and hugs me. I'm mortified and I'm trying to explain that I was just gonna donate it anyway and it's okay it's just a scarf lol.

I'm on my day 40. I have done a stop before for 90 days but did not consciously follow and observe all the changes. One more addition is I've also stopped smoking cigarettes 5 months ago. For a very short background ; I'm an engineer and coffee was a MUST in my everyday work (8+ years), but during high performance times I have drank around 2-3 cups per day having in mind I'm quite sensible to it. This in the end led to:
~Afternoon big crash and sleepiness 
~Getting anxious and what I like to say : plugged in (like a cable in the power outlet 😃) 
~Excessive jaw clenching 
~Very frequent bathroom visits 
~Digestion disrupted 
~Very rare dreams 
~Thirsty no matter how much water I pour into myself + still dry mouth 🙄

After these 40 days (and planning to continue manyyy more), now I am seeing :
~Energy stable throughout the day, no extreme waves in high/low ++overall more energy available. This goes for mental and physical energy in the same amount! 
~Less frequent bathroom visits, no sudden urges 
~Digestion still recovering, but better 
~Not feeling dehydrated all the time 
~No jitteries
~Anxiety is still here but less (it's in my nature as it seems 🙄) , but overall feeling of stress is much much lower and to point out much easier to handle. A thing that is helping here is this new, revived feeling of confidence and courage which can make dealing with stress and overall life more manageable 
~Clearer mind, lower blood pressure and heart rate. During exercise, I feel more power stored in the muscles and generally more motivation for it (not sleepy and lazy all the time due to crashes) 
~Way less depression and negative thoughts, and I am getting the urge to laugh waaay more than before, this means also making others laugh 
~Last but not least : Dreams are so vivid and real almost every day. And btw very interesting and weird 😃 Feels like my brain needed to express... 

As I've mentioned, I have also quit cigarettes so these benefits might be mixed from both. But I really feel much better without coffee... Regarding energy levels. And maybe the post helps someone too. 

I can post more updates if someone is interested, after some months pass. And I'm still on Earth 🥳

Good luck all 🍀

In addition to XR capsules that stop at 37.5mg, Effexor comes in Instant Release tablets at 25mg. These can be broken in half, quarters, or made into a volumetric solution (venlafaxine has a solubility of 572mg/ml in water so it’s highly soluble, but many of the binding agents will precipitate out. These can be removed by running the solution through a pre-wet coffee filter). Also, the primary metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine is an active metabolite, meaning it too functions in much the same way as Effexor. As a result, the effects of IR pills last 24-hours. All the information in this post comes from the FDA fact sheet on Veneflaxine Hypochloride tablets that’s included below. Hope this is helpful to someone else!

We went in November for three weeks and basically followed the foliage throughout our trip. In general, we’re pretty aggressive with our trips and usually wake up on the earlier side and crash by 9 or 10pm. We’re not night owls or party people.

Day 1: 11/6: Arrival into Tokyo

We arrived in Tokyo, picked up our JR Pass, checked into our hotel. Went to go see Tokyo tower at night, get some food, then crashed.

Day 2: 11/7: Tokyo to Sapporo

We activated our 7-day JR pass here and started our travel day up to Sapporo. We took the Shinkansen to Hakodate, then the limited express to Sapporo. Our train left at 6:30ish in the morning and we got to Sapporo around 2:00pm. Since we were coming from the US, the early morning was perfect and this allowed us to rest the whole way. We sprung for the green car pass as well so it was nice and we didn’t have to navigate another airport while still getting the afternoon/evening in Sapporo. It started snowing about halfway on the limited express train and was beautiful to watch from the train. We explored Sapporo station area on arrival then checked into our hotel at 3pm. We explored shops around Sapporo and had miso ramen, which was the best ramen we’ve ever had.

Day 3: 11/8 Sapporo

We woke up, got some delicious coffee at “Love Espresso”, then went up the Sapporo TV Tower (worth it) then went to the old Sapporo factory mall, then the Sapporo museum and beer garden. Got Genghis Khan at the beer garden right when they opened at 11:30 am. You do have to get a reservation ticket from the museum but if you’re early there won’t be a problem. We then went back to the room to rest for a bit and catch a second wind before heading out shopping, exploring, and visiting the arcade. That night we had Yakitori near Odori park before calling it a night.

Day 4: 11/9 Sapporo to Hakodate

We woke up early and headed over to Hokkaido University. We like exploring college campuses when we travel and this was a nice one! There is a street lined with Ginko trees that was very pretty as well. We then checked out and hit up a street market for Oysters and a Salmon bowl (both some of the best seafood we had the entire trip). We took the limited express to Hakodate and got in around 5pm. We went out for sushi then walked around the red-brick storehouse district which had christmas lights and was quite pretty. Unfortunately our plan to go up to the top of Mt. Hakodate was squashed as the gondola was not working and could only be reached by private car or hiking, which we did not have time for. We called it a night after walking around a bit.

Day 5: 11/10: Hakodate to Hirosaki

We got up early in Hakodate and got a taxi to Cape Tachimachi to see the sunrise. Beautiful spot and made Hakodate feel worth it. We then got a Taxi to the old Public Hall and walked through the historic district back to the fish market where we had breakfast. Then we took the train to Hakodate Station and caught a 9:30 ish shinkansen to Shin Aomori. We then took a local train to Hirosaki and then dropped our bags off at the hotel since we were there a few hours before check-in. We went to the Roman Tea room for lunch (recommend) and then explored the Castle and two botanical gardens. Unplanned but it was the last day of their fall festival which was so fun to join. The leaves here were at peak and I got some amazing photographs this day. After that we made our way back to our hotel but got stopped by a Fuji worshiping cult. We didn’t go with them like they wanted but that was a notable experience lol. We did laundry this night at our hotel.

Day 6: 11/11: Hirosaki to Aomori to Morioka

Woke up early and explored the castle grounds again, then got coffee and breakfast at a little mom-and-pop place before checking out and catching a limited express train to Aomori. We only stayed in Aomori for an hour or so to do the Nebuta Museum and A-Factory. We planned on longer but got bored and decided to make our way to Morioka earlier (good call). Took the train to Morioka and checked into our hotel on arrival. Got Morioka Jajamen for lunch then went to the castle ruins and walked around before heading back to the room for a quick recharge. Then went out shopping and dinner at an Izakaya.

Day 7: 11/12: Morioka to Kakunodate

Spent the morning in Morioka and walked to Hoonji Temple. Got an early lunch at Karakoma (vegan place that was VERY good). Then took the train to Kakunodate. We booked an old Samurai warehouse that was turned into a little townhouse. It was huge and worth the experience. We walked around the village, got ramen for dinner, and called it earlier to recharge and enjoy our fancy accommodations.

Day 8: 11/13: Kakunodate to Sendai to Toyama

Last day of our JR pass so we made alot of use of it! Explored Kakunodate again in the morning then got the train to Sendai. We gave ourselves about 5 hours in Sendai so we got soybean milkshakes and went to the Zuihōden grave / temple area. Very pretty. Had lunch at an Izakaya that had lunch specials near the station. Got some taiyaki and shopped for a bit. Then got the train to the outskirts of Tokyo to transfer and go to Toyama. Checked into our hotel in Toyama and went out for Sushi (Toyama is famous for it).

Day 9: 11/14: Toyama to Takayama

Woke up early and explored Toyama. Went up the observation tower and visited the glass art museum (cheap and in a beautiful building/library). Then went to the Japanese sword museum and had Sushi again for lunch. Got our bags and headed by train to Takayama. For the first time in our trip we felt like we were in a tourist town and it was a bit of a shock lol, we adjusted (we’re also tourists afterall). We went to both the retro museums and had dinner a bit off the beaten path and it was very very tasty.

Day 10: 11/15: Takayama

Woke up early and walked to Hido no Sato open air museum. Highly recommend if you’re not going to Shinagawa-go like we were not. There is a wood carver there off to the side where you can see him at work and buy his goods. I got an owl and it is probably my most treasured souvenir from Japan. We walked back to our hotel and stopped to get some sweets and hit up the grocery store on the way. Then we went to lunch at Wabisuki (best soba I’ve had and I keep thinking about the duck soup I had). Then walked to Hie Shrine (another amazing fall foliage spot) and walked through the big park complex nature path area nearby to get back to the historic district. Hit up the sake brewery then went back to the room to finish up laundry and rest for a couple of hours. Went out for Takoyaki since most other places needed a reservation on a Friday night. Not disappointed though, the guy making them was from Osaka and was very friendly.

Day 11: 11/16: Takayama to Fukuji Onsen (Ryokan)

Slept in… whattttt. We were tired and the next day or so was about rest so we slept in a bit, got coffee and breakfast, then took the bus out to Fukuji Onsen where our Ryokan was located. Enjoyed the night there, had A5 Hida beef, did Ryokan things and called it a night.

Day 12: 11/17: Fukuji Onsen to Takayama to Nagoya

Woke up and had breakfast at the Ryokan, then took the bus to Takayama where we killed a few hours at a matcha shop and our favorite grocery store. Took the train to Nagoya and then checked into our hotel. Walked around Odori Park and went up the Electric tower (eh, ok to skip). Went out for udon then walked around and enjoyed the Christmas decor and shopped a bit before crashing for the night

Day 13: 11/18 Nagoya/Ghibli Park

We got Ghibli park tickets so that ate up most of the day. We got Unagi for dinner and purchased limited express tickets for the next day to Nagiso.

Day 14: 11/19 Nakasendo Trail day tripfrom Nagoya

We did the Nakasendo Trail this day but did it backwards from what most people do so it was mostly uphill. We walked from Nagiso, through Tsumago, then ended in Magome. Great hike, loved it, got soba for lunch in Tsumago. After getting back in Nagoya we did some laundry and went out for Yakitori.

Day 15: 11/20 Nagoya to Tokyo

This was our travel day from Nagoya to Tokyo so we checked out of our hotel and got a locker for our bags in Nagoya station. We then went to go explore Nagoya castle and the palace and got a healthy vegan lunch before catching the train to Tokyo. We stayed in the Nihonbashi area of Tokyo, it was quiet and the hotel was nice but a bit of a walk to the station. I definitely recommend being 5 minutes or less not 10 like we were from your closest station. It just added time when you want to be bouncing around. That night we went to Skytree to do tourist things and went to the aquarium. Had a burger because my system needed some western food at that point.

Days 16-21: Tokyo

Days 16-21 were in Tokyo. I won’t go into extensive detail here as this was mostly exploring different parts, going shopping, and having fun. My favorite places are Akihabara and Naka-meguro. Most overrated i think was Korea town, honestly feel like we have way better Korean food back in the states. I found that with the Vietnamese we tried as well. Japanese food in Japan is legit the best but I’d never tried international food internationally (if that makes sense) before and was kinda disappointed.

Day 21: 11/26

Last day with a late flight out of Tokyo so we explored the city in the morning before getting to the airport

Take aways/tips:

For us, we were worried we were going too hard in the beginning of the trip, but we didn’t. Absolutely the best and I loved north Japan. Toyama was probably the most surprising nice city to stop by.

I’m kind of done with Tokyo. I know there is a lot but after spending 5 days our first trip and 6 days our second trip, I think I’m going to keep it to 3 or less on any future trips.

In the world of Bitcoin, transactions are the lifeblood. Every time you send or receive Bitcoin, you're tapping into a vast network of miners, nodes, and algorithms to ensure your digital cash makes its journey. But let’s face it: sometimes the journey feels like a road trip in a rusty old car stuck in traffic.

That’s where **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** roars onto the scene! This turbocharged app is your golden ticket to fast-lane Bitcoin transactions. 🚀 Ready to zoom past the blockchain bottlenecks? Buckle up, and let’s dive in!

# The Dreaded Transaction Traffic Jam

Picture this: you’re at a coffee shop paying for your double mocha latte with Bitcoin. You scan the QR code, click send, and...wait. And wait. And wait. The barista is giving you the side-eye. Customers are tapping their feet. You’re sweating like you just ran a marathon, but the transaction’s still pending.

What gives?

The culprit: **network congestion**. Bitcoin’s blockchain processes a limited number of transactions per block, and when demand spikes, transactions compete for attention. Miners prioritize those with higher fees, leaving budget-conscious users stranded. Enter Bitcoin TX Accelerate: the superhero your transaction’s been waiting for.

# What Is Bitcoin TX Accelerate?

Think of Bitcoin TX Accelerate as the express pass at an amusement park – but for Bitcoin transactions. It’s a premium transaction accelerator app that gets your transaction from ""pending"" to ""confirmed"" in record time.

By leveraging advanced fee-bumping techniques and collaborating with miners, Bitcoin TX Accelerate ensures your transactions leapfrog the queue. Whether you’re transferring funds for a business deal or paying your friend back for dinner, Bitcoin TX Accelerate puts you in the fast lane.

👉 Try it here: [https://www.txaccelerate.com](https://www.txaccelerate.com)

# Why Do Transactions Get Stuck?

Understanding the problem helps you appreciate the solution. Here are the main reasons Bitcoin transactions can stall:

1. **Low Fees:** You set a fee lower than what miners prioritize. Miners, like any business, are incentivized by profit.
2. **Network Overload:** During peak times (like a bull market frenzy), the blockchain is bursting at the seams.
3. **Dust Transactions:** Transactions involving tiny amounts (a.k.a. ""dust"") are often deprioritized.

Bitcoin TX Accelerate combats these issues with precision and flair.

# How Bitcoin TX Accelerate Works

Let’s peel back the curtain and see the magic:

1. **Submit Your Transaction ID**: Simply enter the transaction ID of the stuck payment.
2. **Boost the Priority**: Bitcoin TX Accelerate uses fee-bumping and miner collaboration to elevate your transaction’s status.
3. **Sit Back and Relax**: Watch your transaction go from purgatory to the blockchain hall of fame in no time.

It’s as easy as ordering pizza – but way cooler. 🍕➡️💸

# Why Choose Bitcoin TX Accelerate?

You might wonder, “Why not just set a higher fee from the start?” Good question! While proactive fee setting is important, Bitcoin TX Accelerate shines in scenarios where:

* **You underestimated fees**: Maybe you were trying to save a buck, or the network surged after you hit send.
* **Time is money**: Urgent transactions demand swift action, and waiting isn’t an option.
* **You’re out of options**: Stuck transactions can linger for days without intervention. Bitcoin TX Accelerate is your lifeline.

# A Day in the Life of Bitcoin TX Accelerate Users

# The Trader

Meet Joe, a crypto day trader. Timing is everything for Joe, and a delayed Bitcoin transfer means lost opportunities. Joe relies on Bitcoin TX Accelerate to ensure his funds move at lightning speed, keeping him ahead of the curve.

# The Entrepreneur

Samantha runs an online business accepting Bitcoin payments. During a holiday sale, her transaction queue exploded, causing delays and customer frustration. Bitcoin TX Accelerate swooped in, saving the day and Samantha’s reputation.

# The Casual User

Lisa’s no Bitcoin expert. She sent money to her friend overseas and panicked when it got stuck. A quick visit to Bitcoin TX Accelerate saved her from sleepless nights and awkward ""it’s still pending"" texts.

# Myths About Transaction Accelerators

Let’s bust some common misconceptions:

1. **“They’re only for whales!”** Nope. Bitcoin TX Accelerate is for anyone who values speed, whether you’re sending $10 or $10,000.
2. **“It’s risky!”** False. Bitcoin TX Accelerate operates transparently and safely, with zero risk to your funds.
3. **“It’s cheating the system!”** Not at all. Accelerators optimize the existing fee structure to ensure smoother operations for everyone.

# Tips for a Faster Bitcoin Experience

Even with Bitcoin TX Accelerate, a few best practices can improve your transaction game:

* **Monitor Network Fees**: Use tools like mempool explorers to gauge average fees before sending.
* **Avoid Peak Times**: If possible, transact during off-peak hours for lower congestion.
* **Double-Check Your Inputs**: Ensure addresses and amounts are correct to avoid costly mistakes.

# Bitcoin TX Accelerate: Turbocharging the Future

Bitcoin TX Accelerate isn’t just an app; it’s a revolution. By bridging the gap between transaction delays and user needs, it empowers everyone from hardcore traders to casual enthusiasts.

Imagine a world where Bitcoin payments are as fast and seamless as swiping your debit card. That’s the future Bitcoin TX Accelerate is building, one transaction at a time.

# Ready to Accelerate?

Don’t let stuck transactions slow you down. With Bitcoin TX Accelerate, you’re always in the fast lane, ready to leave blockchain bottlenecks in the dust. 🚗💨

So she would ask my mom or one of my other aunts to spend time with her. Or one of us kids. She couldn't go out to a meal alone, she couldn't go to the movies alone, she didn't want to shop alone. I personally learned codependency at a young age and still struggle with it. I was taught being alone was sad or pathetic or lame or meant you were a loser. What is your relationship with being alone. Do you think being alone less would help you feel less lonely? Sometimes I feel lonely and would feel so much better if I just left rhe house. To go to the library or a park, or even a museum. I could even get into various museums and thing for free. But I have this feeling of ""I should wait until I can do this with other people"" and then continue to isolate. Or I feel like a ""loser"" for being alone in public. If I was someone else who felt they had a reason or purpose for doing something alone in public, maybe I'd feel better. ""I have to go to this museum for a class assignment. I really wanted to try this coffee shop to see if it's cheaper and tastes just as good since it's closer than the other one. I wanted to see if the bookstore has this in stocks and if so how much is it?"" Do you overthink a lot? Is that part of it? ""I'm lonely, and here I am out in public alone, such a loser I am"" instead of being present and mindful in the moment. I am mostly just curious as to how others navigate loneliness. And to maybe understand if there is a similar mindset, and how we can cope with it. If today is your birthday I hope you have such a happy birthday. I'm so happy you were born, even if I don't know you. I hope you get all green lights, and that the weather is nice. I hope you find a hobby or activity that makes you feel less alone. I hope you find a pen pal who writes you letters and sends you cute stuff in the mail. I hope today is good but tomorrow is even better. I hope you all have plenty of hope and if you don't you can borrow some of mine. Deep breath in for four, hold, out for four.

I’ve resisted this because I look at my meals and think, “I’m so healthy!” Yet I’ve been frustrated and confused that I workout so much yet am not as toned as I’d want to be. I’m fine, but I feel like I should be more toned and lean, you know? I definitely have a lot of muscle but I’m not seeing it as much as I’d like.

My workout cycle in a week:
- leg day
- core / upper body day + light cardio (running or swimming)
- bike 10 miles
- leg day
- rest day
- core / upper body day
- run 3 miles or bike 10

Anyway I added everything up just now and I’ve been eating over 3,000 calories a day! I didn’t even realize! My meals will be below but looking at them I just never would have imagined how far over I’d be. I’m 5’1 and every google search says I should eat 1,600 (it’s giving starvation) to 2,400 a day.

Anyway, I’m going to experiment and tweak what I eat just a little and maybe I’ll see a change! Maybe this is boring I’m just putting it out there 1) for any feedback or advice and 2) counting your general calories, at least once, really is important! I’d never have guessed.

Pre-Context : I recently moved to Pune from Bengaluru, a couple months back after a job switch. And also had a recent break up in Julyish/starting of August after which I decided to not get into a commitment or anything till 2025 end, as I believe to not let the previous baggage pass on, rather work and heal on ‘em peacefully. Also switch back to fully focused on building good career and physique.

Context : But since I have been here in Pune:
1. My already known 2 guy friends who were living here * where I put my ass down for a week for the initial house hunt * are both in live-in with their respective partners and them being friendly enough allowed me to have a good time exploring the food places. Buttttt soon after a week or two, every time we went out, they have always brought the topic that it’s time for me to get committed, even tried setting up a date for me.

2. My new flatmates, who are also a pair of couples, but again real friendly and also uber rich, took me to some good spots in the main city. But yep again, they too are always yapping on how I should already find someone and complete this family home, specially when we all get drunk.

3. My lead, who is a real ass saver in my job though, and ultra friendly during coffee breaks for some reason, in a way mocks me, talking to my other friend who we all know is dating 3 different girls simultaneously that “you should enjoy more and go out with a girl and not with * my name * as he is living 10 years elderly than his age.” * Which aint trueee bruh, 2 years max * To which I said agreed, and then he said that I should enjoy life and find a girl and that he can see his past self in me that’s why he is suggesting what’s right to do at this age.

Song : Reminds me of this line:
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""

Conclusion: The point being, I’m not sure if it’s Pune or my small sample space of 3 circles with whom I spend my day, as with Bengaluru ( college friend circle and colleagues ) it was almost about apps and startups ngl. Or maybe I was committed at that time majorly so no one really exclaimed like this or I didn’t notice. 

Post-Context : Rather I’d love to find an accountability partner (guy or gal) who would love to push for a routine that includes meditating, “gym-ming”, studying (dsa), etcetra. I see 1 LPM earning as a basic than being in a relationship. “It’s time you should earn that much no?” Stop the societal pressure already on yourselves and others too ffs!",3,1733864102.0,pune,1,1.0,False

Let’s dive into the basics:

**About Me:**
- 28 years old from NSW, Australia.
- 173cm tall with an average build with blue eyes and brown hair, currently in the process of growing it out.
- I’m as pale as they come—so much so that I might blind you in sunlight or turn into a tomato if exposed for too long.
- I work in tech/finance, but don’t worry, I’m not a finance bro.
- Happy to swap photos if that helps!

**Personality:**
- I’m pretty shy and anxious around new people, but once I warm up, I’m talkative and engaging.
- Introvert at heart, but I do enjoy going out with friends.
- I’m not religious and while I respect all beliefs, it might be tricky to connect with someone who is deeply religious.

**Hobbies:**
- Gaming is a big part of my life—mostly chill games, whether solo or with friends on Discord.
- Occasionally embarrass myself with a round of golf.
- Metalcore fan here! If you’re into Polaris / Thornhill / Sleep Token / etc let’s chat!
- I’ll stay up late to watch Verstappen race or mourn McLaren’s near-wins.

I’ve tried various dating apps without much luck and would prefer to connect with someone in Australia.

I’m looking for someone to make daily activities, like grabbing coffee or running errands, more enjoyable as well as enjoying common hobbies.

I've also kind of caught the travel bug so I'd absolutely love to have someone to travel and see either Australia or the world together.

1hbbzza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1hbbzza/hrt_unsuccessful_what_else_can_help/,HRT Unsuccessful. What Else Can Help?,"At age 41, I officially ""fell apart.""

Symptoms included the sudden and complete loss of the ability to sleep or even nap, crazy brain fog, bloating, digestive issues, dry mouth and eyes, back pain, zero energy, extreme tiredness/exhaustion, tooth grinding at night, constipation, hot flashes/chills, and anxiety/depression, which I've never had an issue with before.

I did a comprehensive metabolic blood panel which was normal. I also tested negative for diabetes, coeliac disease, Sjogrens (including the early Sjogrens test), and my thyroid levels are normal.

I then had a hormone blood panel done that showed I have subclinical levels of all detectable hormones.

I'm aware hormone levels fluctuate throughout the month, but I saw two different OBGYNs and both told me that based on my symptoms alone I'm technically in peri or possibly even full menopause.

I spent months researching hormone replacement therapy. I read several books by Suzanne Sommers (""Ageless"" and ""*I'm Too young For This!*""). I thought I'd found the answer to fixing my health.

In January, I started HRT in the form of testosterone drops, with bioidentical compounded Progesterone and Estrodial in cream form. I had to track my cycle in great detail and apply different quantities of each hormone daily, which was supposed to mimic my natural cycle. I had high hopes.

**GOOD effects were:** Significant reduction in brain fog; bigger boobs (temporarily - they went back to their normal size after 2 months, much to my disappointment!); slightly better sleep with less awakenings in the night; lighter mood; improved digestion; more hydrated ""glowy"" skin.

**BAD effects were:** Severe GERD/acid reflux (to the point where I was awoken every night coughing on acid coming up my throat); moderate hair loss; mild acne; blurred eyesight, which gave me constant headaches as none of my glasses ""worked"" any more; 20LB weight gain in one year, particularly on my stomach.

The GERD/reflux was the worst. My doctor put me on PPIs, which didn't work, then on a new acid blocker called Voquezna, which removed 90% of my symptoms but gave me THE WOST bloating of my life. (As in, 6 months pregnant bloating). I couldn't fit into any of my clothes, and couldn't eat more than a small portion of food in one sitting. I was told to give up all my favorite foods to fight the reflux, including coffee, cheese, spicy food (I love Indian), dairy, wine, and acidic fruits like oranges and tomatoes. I was miserable and just wanted to curl in a ball in a dark room and shut myself away from everything and everyone.

I gave it a year, then decided to discontinue the HRT due to the above side effects. I decided being able to fit into my pants, eat the foods I love and actually \*see\* was worth losing the other benefits of HRT.

**My question:** For those of you who had to discontinue HRT due to side effects, what effects did you suffer, and how long did they take to go away once you stopped the HRT? Were you able to address your menopause symptoms using other methods? (For example, natural remedies, herbal supplements, etc.?)

**TL;DR:** I stopped HRT due to side effects. Have you also experienced HTR side effects, and if so, did they go away when you discontinued it? What other ""remedies"" did you try to help with menopause symptoms?",0,1733864019.0,Menopause,4,0.5,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic procedure for many people seeking a brighter smile. With advancements in dental technology, options for teeth whitening have expanded significantly. This means that you can achieve real results that can boost your confidence and enhance your overall appearance. Let's explore the transformation you can expect with teeth whitening, illustrating real before and after results.

### The Process of Teeth Whitening

Before diving into the results, it’s essential to understand how teeth whitening works. The process typically involves the use of bleaching agents that penetrate the enamel to lift stains and discoloration. Here are some common methods:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This is done by a dental professional using powerful bleaching agents. You often see dramatic improvements in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Dentists provide customized kits with trays and potent whitening gel. Results usually take a couple of weeks to fully develop.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These include strips, gels, and toothpaste designed for whitening. While they are more accessible, results may vary in effectiveness.

### What to Expect: Before and After Results

Many people are curious about actual results of teeth whitening treatments. It’s important to understand that the effectiveness can depend on several factors, including the original shade of your teeth, the type of treatment used, and your unique dental health. Here’s a closer look:

#### Before Whitening

Prior to teeth whitening, you may notice stains from coffee, tea, red wine, or tobacco use. These types of discolorations can make smiles appear dull or aged. Often, people who are unhappy with their smile will refrain from smiling wide in photographs or social situations.

#### After Whitening

After undergoing teeth whitening, the transformation is often striking:

- **Brightened Smile:** Most patients notice an immediate brightness. Depending on the treatment, you can achieve shades that are several tones lighter.
- **Boosted Confidence:** A whiter smile can lead to increased self-esteem. Many people report feeling more positive about their appearance.
- **Youthful Appearance:** Whiter teeth often contribute to a more youthful look, making you appear healthier and more vibrant.

### Real-Life Testimonials

Real results speak volumes. Many individuals share their stories and experiences post-whitening treatment. Here are a couple of popular testimonials:

> ""I was skeptical at first, but after seeing my before and after pictures, I couldn’t believe the change. My smile is so much brighter, and it has completely changed how I feel about myself!"" - Sarah, age 28

> ""I tried at-home whitening kits before, but nothing compares to the results I got in the dental office. My teeth haven't looked this good in years!"" - John, age 34

### Maintaining Your Results

After you achieve your desired whiteness, maintaining your results is crucial. To prolong the brightness of your smile, consider the following:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Limit Staining Foods:** Cut back on beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine, which can contribute to new stains.
- **Regular Dental Care:** Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Periodic touch-ups with at-home kits or occasional professional treatments can keep your smile bright.

The transformation you can expect from teeth whitening is often remarkable. By choosing the method that suits your needs best, you can enjoy a whiter smile that enhances your confidence and overall appearance. Remember, real before and after results can vary, but with proper care and maintenance, your brighter smile can last for years.

During an in-office bleaching procedure, a dentist applies a high-concentration bleach solution on your teeth. The process usually takes about an hour, offering immediate results. Most people notice a significant difference after just one session. This approach is particularly effective for removing deep stains caused by food, drinks, or smoking.

#### Custom Take-Home Kits

If you prefer to whiten your teeth at home, dentists can provide custom trays and professional-grade whitening gel. You’ll wear these trays for a few hours each day or overnight. While results may take longer than in-office treatments, having professional guidance ensures a more effective and safe process. Patients often see substantial improvement within a week or two.

### Over-the-Counter Products

For those seeking a more budget-friendly and convenient option, there’s a wide range of over-the-counter teeth whitening products available. These include whitening strips, gels, and toothpaste.

#### Whitening Strips

Whitening strips are thin, flexible plastic that contains a peroxide-based gel. You apply them directly to your teeth for a specified duration, usually around 30 minutes, for a period of two weeks. While these strips can brighten your smile, they may not provide dramatic results compared to professional treatments. Nevertheless, many users find them satisfying and effective for general maintenance.

#### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpaste works differently from gel and strip options; it often contains mild abrasives and chemical agents to remove surface stains. Using this type of toothpaste long-term can gradually lead to a whiter smile. However, it’s essential to set realistic expectations, as whitening toothpaste primarily targets external stains rather than intrinsic discoloration.

### Natural Remedies

Many people are also turning to natural remedies to whiten their teeth. While these methods can be less impactful than the previous ones, they can still help maintain oral hygiene and promote a brighter smile.

- Apply this paste on your teeth and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.
- Use this method sparingly, as excessive use can wear down enamel.

#### Activated Charcoal

Activated charcoal is another natural option. It’s thought to absorb toxins and stains from the teeth. You can brush with activated charcoal powder or add it to your toothpaste. However, scientific evidence about its effectiveness is limited and should be used cautiously to avoid enamel erosion.

### Impact of Teeth Whitening Methods

The impact of teeth whitening varies by method and individual sensitivity. Here are some key points to consider:

1hbbkpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1hbbkpy/day_1_of_nc/,Day 1 of NC,"Well, today is day 1. I have been contemplating going NC with my mom for years. I always imagined it would have with a big fight and we would just not speak again. Yesterday, I had this overwhelming feeling, sick to my stomach, anxious feeling that I needed her out of my life...at least for a little while. 

I had an ok childhood. My parents divorced when I was 10. My dad was amazing. He recently passed and I think his death highlighted how little I need my mom. She was NC with her parents and my sister has been NC with her for about 25 years ( i am currently 44, mom is 70)

My mother is a classic narcissist. Creates these picture perfect images to show off to her friends, acts like she is the most caring person, inviting people over for dinner and coffee, all while complaining behind there backs that they mooch off her. She makes up obvious lies about people spreading rumors about her and making her look bad.  She has always been super passive aggressive and says whatever she feel like. I dont think anyone has spent time with her and not been insulted by something she says. There is so much more to the story but this what I have confronted her about in the past. She was physically abusive to my sister and my sister went NC pretty young so I became the golden child because there was no one else so I think I had it a lot less rough then my sister

The holidays make me sick. I have been hosting for about 10 years now. Each and every year, I am sick leading up to the day because I am worried about what she will say and who she will insult. I have called her out before and it stopped for a bit but over the past year is even worse then ever. She has a list a mile long of people she hates and is top notch petty. recently she has added my saint of a mother in law to her list of hated people, all because my mother in law id friendly....not friends, friendly with a woman my mother hates. So MIL has become her latest target and has stopped coming to family functions. 

After thinking on this all day yesterday and speaking to my aunt (moms sister) I decided I would call her and tell her I need a break from her. I called her first thing this morning. And acknowledged to her that it may seem out of the blue but these things have been building for years. I kept calm and just said ""i have brought this up before, you refuse to change, I will b taking a break from talking to you and will not be having you over for christmas"" She did the who me? she tried blame other people because ""they do it too"", all the things...but was more worried about what she would tell people about why she wasnt going to my house for christmas. also told me that she thought I was the one who ""always let tings go "" and looked past stuff. I said I did let a lot go and I am tired of it. She said she wouldnt change so I told her that is her choice but I am changing our situation. She started heavy breathing, said she was having a heart attack and hung up.....I felt an immediate calmness but still feel sad. She was never a ""mother' more like a distant aunt but I hate making people feel bad or thinking anyone will be alone. I told her I dont know what the future holds but this is what I need for now. She can still see my kids, they are older 15 and 23, and I will likely answer the phone if she ever calls me but I cant have her around anymore. ",4,1733862957.0,EstrangedAdultKids,4,0.83,False
1hbbke3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1hbbke3/ive_been_to_70_countries_and_wrote_this_ode_to_my/,I've been to 70 countries and wrote this ode to my favorite places,"It's kind of long and heavy on the adverbs, adjectives, and alliteration but if you’re bored and feel like reading my sort of poetic review of the Earth (the parts I’ve been to at least), here it is. 



**Australia** \- The Land Way Down Under is sweet as. A sprawling country with heaps of adventures. I spent quite a bit of time up in **Darwin** and enjoyed it mainly for its ecstatic backpacker community and for **Litchfield National Park**, which contains some really great water holes and waterfalls to jump from. A drive across the outback is a right of passage for anyone looking to become a certified Bogan. A cursory glance at **Uluru** is probably enough (although I didn’t go into King’s Canyon so I don’t know if its worth the effort) in the bloody red center. **Cooper Pedy** aint much but a whole town underground, but I’d say that’s worth a gander. The **Great Ocean Road** is a sumptuous ride along the Southern coast ending (or beginning) at Magnificant **Melbourne**. A lively town, with some well hip neighborhoods (looking at you **Fitzroy**, **Carlton**, and **St Kilda**), some of the best street art on Earth, and a bunch of impressive architecture. **Sydney** sits splendidly on the South Pacific. Great beaches, high quality of life, and a relatively laid back vibe add up to make sunny Sydney one of the world’s most livable cities. The whole stretch of East Coast is loaded with stops. I enjoyed little known **Forster** beach, the **Waterfall Way**, of course **Byron Bay**, **Brissie** aint bad, **Noosa** is cute as, **Mission Beach** is a bit mental (in a good way, thanks **Scotty’s Beach House** for the best job of my life), and **Cairns** is ready for guests.





**Northern Europe** \- Some of the world’s greatest cities and most influential countries live up here and it would be a shame to miss out on this region. Starting in the far far North, **Norway** is a land of unbelievable vistas. Gliding through a fjord, surrounded by waterfall spouting sheer cliffs, is one of the most awe inspiring sights a person can likely behold on this speck of dust. **Stockholm** is a future city of high design and high concept thinking, **Copenhagen**, a pretty, trendy city full of bicycling Vikings with open minds. **Berlin**, an ubercool yet often gritty warren of graffiti that simultaneously depresses and enlivens. The late night scene might be unmatched worldwide and the permeating press of counter culture rebellion feels ahead of its time. **Krakow** in **Poland** is a lovely old town with a lot of drinking going on (maybe a few too many lads on tour). **Buda** and **Pest** can’t stop being the best city in the Central East, **Prague** lives up to its stellar reputation as a lively party town with spellbinding architectural appeal and a Kafka twist. **Switzerland** is a far too expensive fairy land that is somehow worth every penny. It’s hard to oversell the majesty of the **Swiss Alps** or the shrinking feeling of seeing the **Matterhorn** for the first time or the careful appreciation of life quality in **Zurich**. There is eye opening architecture seemingly every time you turn your head in **Vienna.** And don’t even get me started on **Paris**, The City of Lights, is a city I’d always felt I’d already been to. It loomed large in my mind, but as a place impossible, a literary device, an imaginary setting to hide away in when things weren’t going well. But it is real, and it is immense. With a dizzying array of world class attractions and a depth of culture that a lifetime of exploration couldn’t possibly behold, Paris is a behemoth. **Brussels** is beervana and has one of the most fetching main squares I’ve ever seen. **Amsterdam** is a city of sensual delights, wrapped in handsome canals, filled with revelry, so starkly Dutch, and a total pleasure to peruse. And, finally, rainy **London**. I’ve spent about a week in the English Capital and it was overcast and raining almost every second I was there. The **British Museum** blew me away, as did the long strolls through history I took as I marched dozens of miles in its many neighborhoods. Soaking wet and cold in July and I still found London fascinating, which says a lot, because of the few things that I really don’t like in this world, being cold and wet just about tops the list.





**Team North America** \- Home Sweet Home is vast and contains some of this worlds greatest natural wonders, cities and events. My personal favorite part of North America is the wild, wondrous west and all of its tremendous nature. Few places ive been to can compare with the wide open freedom of unfenced **Wyoming**, **Montana**, **Utah** and **Colorado**, with the carefully curated loveliness of the **National Parks**, with the wistful winding of the **Pacific Coast**. Some of my very best experiences in life have come in the quiet moments of hiking a trail deep in the **Cascades** or the **Olympics** or the **Rockies** and suddenly being confronted with a gob smacking view of eternity. In those moments of intense clarity and joy, brought on by nothing more than sheer beauty, I can’t seem to find a single thing wrong with this world. Many, if not most, American cities can feel copy and pasted from some corporate template of autocentric consumerism but there are quite a few gems out there. Personal favorites include, of course, my hometown **New Orleans**. I admit major bias, but in all my travels I have yet to find a city so breathlessly in love with extravagantly celebrating life, so enraptured by shared revelry, so supportive of the weird, wild and wonderful. It’s music everywhere, all the time, its boisterous sidewalks filled with merrymakers, its cozy subtropical lush with a penchant for florid aesthetics. **New York City** towers in my mind. Rocking up in the middle of one of the coldest winters on record my first time there, I immediately fell in love. The buzz on the streets is thrilling, the variety of experience is bewildering, the sense of endless possibility is enthralling. It’s the whole world in microcosm yet utterly unique. I’ve been back a dozen times since and feel like I’ve barely nibbled. Other great cities I love are **Denver**, for its proximity to great heights and for being a young, fun town with a lot to offer, **Seattle** for its gorgeous location and cool vibes, **San Francisco** for its density of diversity, **Boston** for its pretty, walkable center, **Austin** for its scene, **Asheville** for its quirk and its surrounds, **DC** for its museums, **Chicago** for its skyscrapers and scale, **Miami** for miles of white sand, **Moab** for being a funky little adventure town in the middle of incredible scenery, **Jackson Hole,** **Whitefish, Telluride,** and **Breckenridge** for being picturesque cowboy towns adjacent to National Parks or beautiful ski mountains, and tiny **Hood River, Oregon** for its quaint Victorian appeal, offbeat sensibilities and stunning setting. (I could go on but this is getting out of hand).

Oh! **Canada**, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. First, What a friendly, happy, clean place! There is plenty to discover in the Great White North and I can’t wait to get back up there. **Victoria** was my first stop and found it to be beautifully English with a bit of an unsavory, yet still unthreatening underbelly. Vivacious **Vancouver** next, which struck me as a gloriously adorned metropolis, sat soaringly well betwixt striking mountain walls of snowcapped splendor. I haven’t made it to the Canadian Rockies yet but based on hearsay and photos I must go there as soon as I possibly can. On the other side of the continent I fell in love with **Quebec City** and its storybook castle atop a hill, surrounded by carefully kept colonial quaintitude, all overlooking the serene, yet frigid, St Lawrence. Further downriver, **Montreal** sits sprawling, a varied and quirky city split between language and heritage, pushing strong to create in a sort of industrial environment. **Toronto** came out of nowhere to really impress, a big welcoming world city that has a whole bunch of fun scenes.

**Mexico** gets such a bad wrap but in reality it is one of the world’s great countries with an absolute abundance of gifts awaiting anyone who dares to get there. The extravagant chaos that is **Mexico City** excites the senses, the uninhibited **Oaxacan** coast is a perfect place to unwind, the jungle temples of **Palenque** mystify and the cozy cupcake mountain town of **San Cristobal de las Casas** can capture your heart. The central coast towns of **Puerto Vallarta** and **Sayulita** are great for sippin and surfin. **Guadalajara** is jumping and **San Miguel de Allende** is a picturesque retreat. Check out the **Yucatan** for all your white sand, and turquoise sea dreams, **Tulum** for cosmopolitan jet setting and **Isla Mujeres** for the easiest and best little island escape between two oceans.

**Puerto Rico** gets a special mention for being exceptionally great. **San Juan** is an underrated city with beautiful blue stoned streets lining its old town, lots of historic sights, a pumping joyful energy, and a pleasant beach in town. Plenty to see and do around the island but little offshore **Vieques** and its **Bioluminescent Bay** stand out as globally relevant destinations.





**Southeast Asia** \- This was where my initial international great escape brought me and I still think of it very fondly. Among backpackers (particularly Europeans and Australians) this is usually the first and most common place to have an adventure but for me it lived up to and far exceeded any expectation I might have had. The whole region is simply breathtaking, with so many phenomenal natural sights, staggeringly immense ancient ruins, and ludicrously large parties, you might never leave. The Bay islands in **Thailand** can be a bit overrun but that full moon party on luxuriant **Koh Phangan** is an unstoppable force of hedonism (whether you like it or not you can't deny its a spectacle. Also, **Haad Rin** beach is one of the softest, whitest, most perfectly set beaches on Earth), and the diving on pretty **Koh Tao** is world class (and so cheap!). **Bangkok** is kind of a mess, but an invigorating one, **Chang Mai** is a classy city up north with lots of culture and **Pai** even further up is another (maybe the original) cool ass, far flung traveler enclave just begging you to rent a thatched hut, put your pack down, pack your pipe and stay awhile. You wouldn't be a ""real"" traveler if you didn't get black out drunk tubing down **Vang Vieng** in **Laos**, flip flopped flabbergasted through the sprawl of **Angkor Wat** in **Cambodia**, or stayed for free at **Utopia** hostel in **Sihanoukville**. **Vietnam** (crossing the street in **Saigon** is unforgettable) and **Malaysia** (**Penang** is worth a look) held some interest and have plenty to discover but it was **Indonesia** that really blew my socks off. Something about the architecture, the pace of life, the moonscapes, the stark divergence of cultures from island to island, the extremely low prices, the weather, the proliferation of ornate temples (mostly on **Bali**), the food, and the locals all built up Indonesia as one of my very favorite places in the world. **Ubud** in Bali is such a spellbinding world of artistic expression and worship that it seemed like every house and building was as fastidiously adorned in accouterment as an offering to the gods. Riding around Bali on a motorcycle, going from temple to temple under the ever watchful eye of lofty Mt Agung was one of my greatest joys in my life. Across the water in **Lombok** i found yet another of my favorite tiny traveler enclaves, **Gili Trawagan**. That little islet still looms large in my imagination as a place of near perfection that I long to return to. No police, no military, no motorized vehicles, only sandy streets, magic mushrooms, surfing, diving, beautiful views in every direction and a bright comradery shared between the intrepid travelers that somehow made it there. On **Java**, **Bromo** volcano is one of the most ridiculously imposing earth structures I've ever laid eyes on. Let’s go Bromo! You would literally just need to see it to believe it, pictures do nothing to Bromo. ""Bromo eat picture for breakfast!"" And **Jogjakarta**, with its shadow puppets and **Borobudur** is waiting patiently for your arrival.





**Latin America** \- Latin America is one of the most potent adventure per minute regions you’re ever likely to come across. There are so many stunning locations packed into this strip of green you might find yourself tripping over your own jaw. **Guatemala** as a whole is truly a wonder of the world, overflowing with awe inducing sights and sensations, and containing a certain ineffable magic that seemed to permeate every corner of that wondrous country. The towers of mystery in **Tikal** tickle, the otherworldly cascades of **Semuc Champey** (courtesy the never ending party at the unbelievably beautiful **Zephyr Lodge** in **Lanquin**) shake up you’re perception of reality, the street scenes in irresistible **Antigua** offer themselves as presents to the inquisitive adventurer, and, for me, one the most mind blowing places on Earth, **Lago de Atitlan** (with **San Pedro la Laguna** on the lake shore being easily one of the best traveler enclaves ive ever been to) is just plain incredible. The circling mountain walls of Lago de Atitlan contain such powerful majesty that it takes three looming anchor volcanoes just to keep the whole place from rocket shipping directly into heaven. **Caye Caulker** in **Belize** is quintessential backpacker chill out, **Utila** in **Honduras**, the same, but with more scuba diving and guifitti shots, the black sand surf town in **El Salvador**, **El Tunco** is way laid back, volcano boarding in **Nicaragua** is a must-do life achievement, **Leon** and **Grenada**, both great colonial cities to indulge your senses in, slamming down cicada slingers in the **Treehouse Hostel** on the side of an active volcano is over the top awesome, the dueling volcano islands, **Ometepe**, that rise from the middle of gigantic Lago Nicaragua fly straight out of our collective unconscious, **San Juan del Sur** is fun, catching a wave under a malestrom in **Maderas** is a must do, **El Castillo** deep in the jungles is quite intriguing. **Costa Rica** is pristine beauty wrapped in an (expensive) bow. **Arenal**, **Monteverde**, and **Puerto Viejo** are all grand visits (shout out to **Rockin J**'s!) The outstanding archipelago of **Bocas del Toro** just across the border in **Panama** is a tropical treat, and **Casco Viejo** in **Panama City** is one of the loveliest old colonial towns I've ever been to.

I could give **Colombia** its own listing because I love it so much but I'll just tack it on here as it shares so many qualities with the rest of Latin America. Colombia is glorious. There is an undeniable energy that pulses through the air, a windswept titillation that filled me with tireless exuberance. On the Caribbean coast, colorful, carousing **Cartagena** (don't miss swimming in the mud volcano!) and the all night ragers in stupendously set **Taganga** (another world favorite bohemian traveler enclave) will almost certainly envelope you in a warm cloak of comfort. From Taganga its easy to get to **Parque Tayrona**, an outstanding beach side national park and to the **Ciudad Perdida** trek, possibly the most exhilarating, eye opening walk of my life. Five days of hiking up and down soaring jungle mountains, fording raging rivers, sleeping in hammocks, meeting never conquered indigenous tribes and finally ascending a thousand stairs into a forgotten ancient city precariously perched on the point of a precipice. It was an experience I will always remember vividly and in full color. Inland one can find the splendid city of **San Gil** where its best to indulge in all kinds of adventures, be it class V whitewater rafting, subterranean cave diving or jumping off a cliff with a parachute on. **Medellin** is easily one of the most stimulating cities in Latin America and Earth,  tiny **Salento** in the coffee region is muy especial, with one of the best hostels ever (**La Serrana**), some of the most striking views anywhere, and probably the most mesmerizing firefly sunsets this side of Andromeda. And don’t forget deep in the **Amazon** there are entire universes of wonder to be uncovered. Two months wasn't even close to enough for Colombia...

The entire stretch south is just one wonder after another. In **Ecuador** you'll probably find out that **Quito** is cool, climbing **Cotopaxi** then bombing it on a mountain bike is incredible, **Banos** is bonkers beautiful, surfing and partying in **Montanita** is definitely recommended, and if you ever get the chance to sail through the **Galapagos** to gawk at its surreal display of landscapes and life don't think twice, take the voyage.

**Peru** is a fantastic from top to bottom. Surfing in **Mancora** is a must, lining up the lomo in **Lima** is definitely the move, full sending in a dune buggy around the desert oasis of **Huacachina** is ridiculously fun, and following the lines while flying over **Nazca** is straight up special. The Incan's legacy looms large around **Cusco** and the **Sacred Valley**. Check out every ruin you can find, get spiritual in **Pisac**, and obviously melt your brain (and thighs) by climbing up to **Machu Picchu** and bearing full witness to the majesty of the deep past. If continuing south, **Lake Titicaca** is huge and floating with the Uros folks on their reed islands is unforgettable.

**Bolovia** is nothing but thrilling adventures at the top of the world. Barreling down the **Death Road** on a bike all day will stay with you forever. Beginning at a brisk 15,000 feet in space you bundle up and embark on a full day of downhill bravado. One side of the road is a cliff dropping directly into eternity, the other a sheer rock face lined with waterfalls. By the time you descend you'll be sweating in the Amazon watching monkeys swing through the trees. Tremendous experience. The three day 4x4 trek through the seemingly endless expanse of bright white salt near **Uyuni** is pure distilled wonder in every direction.

I haven't yet properly explored **Chile** but I had one of the greatest days of my life tripping on San Pedro deep in the **Valle De Luna** near the Tatooine look alike town **San Pedro de Atacama,** and enjoyed a few nights in **Santiago.** Lots yet to see in Patagonia and throughout the high Andes, will have to report back once I do.

I also haven't done nearly enough in **Argentina** but bouncing around bustling **Buenos Aires** was a blast, had the best steak of my life and didn't even start partying til about 3am on average.

Honorable mentions go to **La Culata** high in the **Venezuelan** Andes for being such a strange, mystical place and where I had an intense spiritual moment improv jamming on a mountain peak and **Los Llanos** also in Venezuela for being so dang packed with strange creatures.

Negatives for this region include the possibility of danger (although this of course exists everywhere and its mostly just an impression of danger. I personally never had any problem), crazy bus drivers, and its not always the cleanest place.





**Mediterranean Europe** \- This is a large, diverse region that I could separate into countries and cities but I'm going to put it all together because as a whole it might just be the most amazing stretch of Earth available, albeit a very familiar, common one to travel in. It contains some of the worlds greatest historic wonders, several of the world’s most impressive, important cities and plenty splendor spread thick from end to end. **Barcelona**, a magical maze of intrigue that captivated me from the first seconds, had called to me long before I ever arrived. Its plethoric range of offerings vary dramatically, between mountain and sea, medieval and modern, elite and everyman, surreal and ordinary. Parading through the Gothic Quarter feels like finding yourself a celebrated artist in the Renaissance, inspiration oozing from every arch, the world awaiting your next move. Fireworks exploding on the beach by Barceloneta, the gall of Gaudi, the diamond maze of Eixample, the Placa in Gracia, and the revel in el Raval. I want to live in Barcelona one day. Lovely **Lisbon** is gorgeous cool spread archingly delicate over several seaside hills, spilling brilliantly into the azure Atlantic. It's filled to brimming with that certain sense of Magellan exploration and getting perked up on Pink Street is pretty fun. Italia is involuntary. A place everyone must go if they can. Certainly a Mecca for me as an ancestral Italian, the perfecta trifecta of Italian cities **Venice**, **Florence** and **Roma** are just tremendous. Roma is the mother city of earth and contains more awe per block than anywhere else. Sashaying through history and glory you remain constantly captivated, finding it hard to keep your jaw from slacking. Florence is endless, just a picture perfect production of ultra high society. Venice should only exist in our dreams. Getting lost in that labyrinth will leave a little extra luster in your life forever more. Basically every aspect of Italian life is seductive, be it the food, the people, the history, the architecture, or the endless masterpieces. I’m only able to understate the impressiveness of these cities, they are just too special, too significant, too fantastic for an encompassing summation. Its hard to walk a block in Italy without being overwhelmed by a wave of wonderment. The kaleidoscopic collision of cultures that is **Istanbul** is astounding as is its smorgasbord of world class attractions. In the hinterland there is much to discover as well. **Porto** is a charmer, **Santiago de Compostela** is filled with divine yearning, **San Sebastian** is a hell of a well set city, **Pamplona** seduces, **Malaga**’s got great people, **Ronda**’s got a gorge, **Seville**’s got a whole heckava lot and **Andorra**’s Pyreneesian peaks inspire. Deep in the South of France **Carcassonne** was precisely like the fantasy Medieval castle town that I’d pretend I was a knight in as a child. Go to **Ljubjana** and dance with the dragon, go to **Belgrade** and play drums in a bombed out building, go to **Romania** and chase the Transylvanians, go to **Veliko Tarnovo** and take illegal pictures in the cathedral. Hitchhike to **Amasra** along the Black Sea coast in a pile of macadamian nuts pulled behind a tractor, be captivated in a cave city in **Cappadocia**, scamper through the ruins of **Troy**, island hop through the **Aegean,** soar through wonder while crossing the border from **Chamonix** to **Aosta**, tiptoe through the lavender in **Annecy,** **Avignon,** and **Aix,** dodge the mafia while downing the best pizza in **Napoli** then get lost in time while finding the meaning of life in **Pompeii.**

It’s the landscapes! the history! the culture! the food! the nightlife! the ease of travel! The quality of life!

The joie de vivre!



So there you go, my favorite places in the world, whatever that’s worth. Of course these are all just my opinions, based solely off the places I’ve already been.

I know this might be a bit of a long shot, but I’m a 43-year-old guy who’s had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I’ve worked hard, learned a lot, and found success—especially financially—and I’d love to share some of what I’ve learned along the way with someone who’s starting out in life and could use a bit of guidance.

I’m looking for someone in the 18-24 age range who might be navigating big decisions, career choices, or just the challenges of life. If you’re feeling a bit lost or unsure about the future, I’d be happy to offer advice, share my experiences, or simply be a steady, positive presence in your life. I’ve made mistakes, learned valuable lessons, and come out stronger on the other side—especially in managing finances and setting myself up for success. If you’re looking for practical advice or just someone who’s been through the grind, I’m here to help.

I tend to connect better with women, as I find the conversations feel more natural and less awkward.

I travel for work often, so while it’s not expected, there’s a chance we might cross paths somewhere. If I’m in your area, maybe we could grab coffee or lunch and chat in person—again, no pressure at all!

If this resonates with you and you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out. I know it’s a bit of a long shot, but I’d love to offer support, mentorship, or just be a steady friend as you figure things out.

In all transparency, I have other health issues going on as well.  One that I found about the same time as the hernia which has put me all in severe anxiety and depression.  I won’t go into detail about the other issues, but just stick to the hernia. 

At first, I was put on a PPI (Pantoprazole), an HR blocker (Famotidine) and a magnesium supplement.  I think I was on them a week or so, but stopped as I was not having acid reflux and was feeling fine.  I put myself on a clean diet (no coffee, spicy foods, citrus, the usual) and was feeling ok, if not 100%. 

However I would have flare ups and would try to put myself on the Pantoprazole or Famotidine, but I hated those mediations.  I would, at best, be on them for a couple days than quit.  My Dr. tried to switch me to Omeprazole, but that made me feel worse.  After this last flare up and talking to my dr., I have been using the Pantazole and the magnesium for over a week now.  It has helped, but now I am getting a burning sensation behind my sternum (hello anxiety attack!), and a feeling like a sore throat.  I was also having a sensation like something was stuck in my throat or that my throat would close up.

Since my original hernia diagnose, I have lost over 30 pounds (not just fat, but muscle too), feel week all the time, have gotten migraines (never had them before), constipation, can’t sleep well, and to top it off, sever anxiety and depression.  4 months ago, I was fit (a bit overweight), active, enjoyed life, traveled, and ate whatever I wanted to.  Now, I can barely leave the house, and on a very restricted diet (no coffee is killing me!)  I am obsessed with my health!  Any little pain sends me into a panic.  Certain movements seem to irritate the hernia (bending over, laying on my stomach, carrying anything heavy), I have a constant feeling like I will never get any better.  I have been to the ER a couple times in a panic (where they found nothing really wrong with me and said it was GERD or gastritis.).

My dr. originally put me on Sertraline (Zoloft), but I had a reaction to it.  I’m on Buspirone (Buspar) now which seems to be helping.  I have only been on it a week so I still am having anxiety flares.  I do have lorazepam for panic attacks but try not to take these as little as possible (afraid to get addicted).  I am staring to talk to a therapist as well.  I have been trying to walk every day (I use to power walk 5 days a week before this) and started to use resistance bands for strength training.  I have tried to do Yoga, but certain movements irritate my hernia.

I’m getting an Endoscope and Colonoscopy Thursday and am (of course) anxious about.  I am anxious about the procedure and what them might find.

 I am so worried about the burning in the chest.  My rational mind says it’s the GERD, the other side (the dark place) says it’s a heart attack or angina. 

I’ll just say this whole thing sucks, but I am trying to do better.  I am trying not to obsesses about my life before or what I could be.  I am taking it one day at a time and just trying to do better on that day.  Anybody else going through this or feel like this?",1,1733862760.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False

For context, I grew up in San Francisco and now live outside of Honolulu. We went into it not knowing much, and came out of it feeling like, why isn't this city talked about more!? Some things we did:

* Got lunch at Chicago's Pizza and coffee at Ludlow Charlington's based off of previous threads here, both were delicious
* Went to the Shedd Aquarium, which was incredible - I went to college in Monterey and have been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium several times and Shedd was just as good and, in some ways, even better. We had our 1 year old in tow and he had a great time.
* Went to the Christkindlmarket - if we had a chance to do it again, I probably would have gone on a weekday or gone to the one in Aurora because it was way too crowded.  Still had a great time looking at all the stalls.
* Walked around downtown, went to the Christmas Tree and Cloud Gate - oh my GOODNESS your downtown is incredible. Even coming from a city like SF, Chicago's downtown is huge and bustling and absolutely beautiful. Especially during the holiday season, so many lights and we even got a glimpse at the Christmas train passing by.
* Grabbed some Chicago dogs from Devil Dawgs on our way out of town which were just as delicious as lunch.

We headed back on our (9.5 hour 😫) flight the next day wishing we could have spent a whole week seeing the city. I'm sure everyone here knows it, but what an incredible city you have - maybe the best in the country. We will absolutely be back, and until then thank you so much for showing us such an incredible time!

I know this might be a bit of a long shot, but I’m a 43-year-old guy who’s had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I’ve worked hard, learned a lot, and found success—especially financially—and I’d love to share some of what I’ve learned along the way with someone who’s starting out in life and could use a bit of guidance.

I’m looking for someone in the 18-24 age range who might be navigating big decisions, career choices, or just the challenges of life. If you’re feeling a bit lost or unsure about the future, I’d be happy to offer advice, share my experiences, or simply be a steady, positive presence in your life. I’ve made mistakes, learned valuable lessons, and come out stronger on the other side—especially in managing finances and setting myself up for success. If you’re looking for practical advice or just someone who’s been through the grind, I’m here to help.

I tend to connect better with women, as I find the conversations feel more natural and less awkward.

I travel for work often, so while it’s not expected, there’s a chance we might cross paths somewhere. If I’m in your area, maybe we could grab coffee or lunch and chat in person—again, no pressure at all!

If this resonates with you and you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out. I know it’s a bit of a long shot, but I’d love to offer support, mentorship, or just be a steady friend as you figure things out.

I remind myself every day of how hard it was to quit and that I never want to go through it again. And I've been managing to do day on day off or 2 days off in between. But something always comes up a stressful 'excuse'. It's definitely making me feel more tired on off days. This sleepiness in the mornings I can't shake just feels like I want to stay asleep. 

Part of the problem is i moved to a very coffee culture place where everyone's day revolves around 'getting a coffee' a few times a day. I've been having decaf. Maybe why the problem is continuing. 

Anyway today is an 'off day'. I'm going to try to make 7 days starting today.

Currently, I am in my PhD 4th year. I was preparing for civil services (ultra difficult exam in India) for the first 3 years, and during that time, my then boyfriend and now husband suddenly realised that we should get married, so we got married so obviously my preparation did not go as expected. I am not blaming the marriage, maybe it was a blessing. But after marriage, I feel like I am constantly just running from one task to another task. All the festivals are to be celebrated together, so many vacations to go on, and my problem is I don't earn enough to be indulging in all of this. Before marriage, I was a strong, independent girl, but expenses after marriage have skyrocketed. The Indian attires are expensive but I have to look presentable at my in laws house. My husband pays for them sometimes but I feel so pathetic letting him pay for my clothes, but I also feel he ought to buy those clothes for me because I am wearing them for him.  
My PhD is suffering. I don't get time to concentrate. My husband's expectation is that I have the easy job because I don't earn so why work so hard. Another expectation is that I should be spending all the time when I am not with him doing my research work only to finish it off so that we can spend more time with family and friends. He thinks going to the gym is a waste of time but he likes me being all lean and fit.  
I am a woman with 5000 hobbies. I love strength training, running, reading and just sipping my coffee. But now it feels like I am under pressure all the time to finish a chore, or finishing my research in free time so that I can visit his friends, or attend a wedding, or travel with him.  
I feel like after marriage women are set up to fail in the professional life. They are not given time and space to build a career and then when it doesn't happen, they are told that they did not have it in them.

If you read my other posts you’ll get more of a back story. But to start with this. My gf has been terribly abusive. Hitting me beyond belief for sometimes the most ridiculous of reason. Really just every time she got angry. It was terrible. I could never leave. If I tried she’d chase my truck down or threaten to get rid of my dogs and she’d throw them outside so I had to come back. Then I was trapped. 

I would create these plans to be able to get my stuff and the pups and leave and then she would be good and innocent and cute for a couple days and we would be excited and talking about baby and I would end up staying. And then another episode would always come.

Well recently I went through about three straight days of episodes. Her hitting me over and over, hitting the baby bump, making me leave the house, making me take my stuff out of the house, her throwing my stuff out of the car window as we were driving then dumping hot coffee all over me. (There was hitting and physical abuse all three days btw) I had enough. 

I left. With everything I already had in my truck. Got my own apartment. And was prepared to use the police to get the rest of my stuff. I didn’t want to. But if that was the only way then I would. Anyways she wanted to talk about things and told me she’s gonna change. I’ve told her to get help multiple times now she’s actually saying she’s gonna do it. She begs me not to leave her and all this. And for some reason I keep caring and I don’t want to see her hurt or alone. 

I think this time she is serious. But I’m not totally sure. And even if she is. I don’t really know if I even want to stay after all she has done. She’s broken so many things of mine. Hit me so many times. But in the end she’s still carrying my child. I don’t think I want to stay, but I’m struggling to force myself to leave.

Recently, I was able to purchase a Bambino + DF54 for my house and while over, my cousin tried the coffee and fell in love. She thought it was so good, she decided to get one for herself however, she wanted a grinder that could do large quantities of grinding as well as in her household, there is others who drink drip coffee. 

She ended up purchasing an Breville Bambino, like me, however, she tried ordering the Baratza Encore ESP but it came with parts missing and she was so impatient to try her new machine so she settled on the Fellow Opus Conical Burr Grinder as it was available for same day pickup at Target. 

I explained to her the 1:2 ratio of beans to liquid, and it seems like she can fit about 17 grams of grounds in her standard portafilter that came with the machine. So I explained that in the end, she should be pulling about 34 grams of coffee. 

She's having a hard time adjusting the grind size on the opus and the water output of the Bambino. Her questions include: 

* How do we know which grind size to use to adjust the water output of the Bambino? For example, I could grind on setting 4 or 3, and the water output seems the same. Which grind setting should she use before she programs the buttons to the desired output of liquid. (For my own personal setup, since I used a bottomless portafilter, I just kept going finer and finer until I noticed that the water was way too slow or just short of choking the machine).
* What is the most efficient way of stopping the bambino at getting your desired amount? It's going way to fast for her and she can't stop it at 34 grams. I tried telling her to try stopping at 32 grams and it should be fine but she can't do it lol.

Duration of symptoms- several years 



I am looking for insight as I’m not sure why this happens to me. I feel like I wake up to pee every single night 4-5 hours after I fall asleep. I find it difficult to fall back asleep after I wake up and it’s very frustrating. I’m not sure why this happens. I can easily go 8 hours during the day without stopping to pee if I need to. Not that I hold it purposely often but I’m capable of it. 


The only thing that helps is if I basically stop drinking liquids 4 hours before bed. So if I’m going to be at 10 I need to stop drinking anything by 6. And even then sometimes I still wake up to pee. And I don’t think it’s a good thing to dehydrate myself like that? 


I do have acid reflux and symptoms worsen at night. I’m not sure if maybe it’s my reflux that’s waking me up and then my body realizes I also need to pee. But it’s difficult to just go back to sleep when I’ve realized I have to pee. Besides waking up at night I don’t have any other symptoms. I drink around 2-3 water bottles a day and don’t usually have soda or juice or coffee. Very rarely I drink tea. No alcohol consumption either.

I’m gonna put a lot of context into this because I wanna say that I used to pride myself on not being a jealous girlfriend. As well as my boyfriend has friends who are girls that I’m completely fine with it’s just this one in particular. 

I’m giving fake names, I’m calling the boyfriend Jake, our roommate Chloe, and the girl friend Alison.
 I (f22) have been dating my boyfriend (m26) for about 6 months now. When we first started dating we really bonded over cartoons and animations because he dreams of opening his own animation studio one day, and as such every Sunday he goes to the coffee shop to work on his art and animation with our roommate (f23) and sometimes me. 

We moved in together at the start of our relationship due to a situation that left me almost being on the streets, at first it was an adjustment but I think we have a system and it works great now. He used to date our roommate Chloe for a year, but they’re just friends now and I believe that and don’t really feel uncomfortable or threatened. 

Occasionally we meet new people at the coffee shop and one day Chloe met Alison (26f), and introduced us to her. I thought she was really cool, as did Jake. So Alison would say how her only friend is her mom or people she did the driving for, I didn’t text her as much but her and my boyfriend texted every day. Now I don’t think Alison is doing anything wrong, she’s married she has a daughter and she says her and her husband have a polyamorous relationship. Not my business. 

It bugged me when they went from texting all day every day to hanging out every day every other day but Jake saying he was stressed and couldn’t hangout with me.

 Jake is an avid hiker and takes 4 hour walks normally by himself. He started taking these walks with Alison. I said as a joke one day do I need to be worried and he said “no, if she were engaged that would be one thing that would mean I could swoop in but I don’t mess with marriage” so curious I said what does that mean, he explained to me how he has broken up engagements before and doesn’t have a problem with doing so again which rubbed me the wrong way. 

I asked if he could stop hanging out with her as much because it’s starting to make me uncomfortable. He would hangout with her all day after work, get home at 9:30 pm, not really talking to me during the day, at this point I felt like I was being paranoid and jealous. But he said he didn’t want to stop hanging out with her because she has no friends (she is now friends with my best friend and our roommate) and he and her have a connection due to her also really liking cartoons and animations, he even started talking about wanting to have her come work at his work as his assistant, he works as a hydraulic mechanic, and she has arthritis in her back making her unable to lift and such but he said he still wants her to be a part of the shop In some way. 

When I told my roommate Chloe about all this she said she had no idea any of this was happening and said I had a right to be upset. Jake thinks I have no right to be upset, I said you can’t just say you have a connection with another girl and be fine after that. 

I reached out to Alison which in hindsight I shouldn’t have done, I was crying and emotional and had told her the situation. The next day I heard she was also calling me paranoid and how she hates jealous girlfriends. 

Me and Jake had a heart to heart and I said I don’t mind if he sees her on Sunday at the cafe and texts her but I don’t feel comfortable with anything further. And that was about a month ago and everything was getting better. 

Last night he asked me how he could change my mind so he could start hanging out with her more again, I asked when he had the time for that because he was just saying earlier how he had no time for anything with the holidays coming up he said he just does. I don’t know what to do and if I’m TAH then I ofc would back off. But something about all of this gives me a bad feeling. And I feel like we’re just gonna start fighting about this again and I want to know if there’s a better way to resolve the issue. 

Thanks so much.  ",9,1733861789.0,AITAH,48,0.76,False

I have been together with my GF for 9 months, we moved in together 2 months ago (I know it's very quick but I had a fight with my father, and she was spending a lot of money renting a place by herself).

 When we first started dating, we also worked together. While working together I noticed her do things a couple of times that seemed too flirty for me and made me jealous. I think one of my worse traits as a partner is that I get jealous pretty easily, but I really don't want to be controlling so i try to ignore it.

One example is, she started talking with a coworker about learning languages. When he said he has trouble with English, she offered to teach him by texting and calling him and practicing with him. Then she wrote her phone number on his wrist with a pen so they could keep in touch. (He didn't ask for her number, or tutoring. She just offered it and gave it to him)

After talking with a female acquaintance about it to make sure I'm not overreacting (she agreed and said my gf is too flirty with everyone), I had a talk with her. Told her that, and she was sorry. Said she doesn't know what exactly to do about it but she'll try her best. Similar things kept happening so we had 2 more talks with basically the same answer.

Since moving in with her, we both work separately. She keeps telling about men asking her out. Recently told me about having a long talk with a guy on the bus, who invited her to a coffee shop. She accepted, but told him she has a boyfriend, at which point he said he's sorry and took back the invitation.

The most concerning thing though, is that yesterday she met a new guy at work. He invited her and 2 other people to do another shift at a different place when they are done. She send me a message saying that she'll do another shift with a group of people she met and only come back home tommorow (today) at 7 am. So when they finished this shift he gave the 2 people who were with them a ride home, and offered my GF to come to his house since she lives far away, which she accepted. Told me he called his mother and told her ""I'm bringing a girl over. No not like that."" And he has a home gym where they just worked out together. After that they picked up the two other people and drove to do a night shift somewhere in town. Returned home by herself before the shift ended because she felt sick.
I know her well, I know she's not cheating because she's not that type of person. But I can't be the only one that thinks this is way too much. Right? Haven't told her anything about my feeling this time since it seems to make no difference.

TL:DR - GF met a new group at work today, went to do a night shift with them but while waiting went with one dude, who invited her to his house (by herself, just the two of them) and she accepted. After that did a night shift with the group. Don't know what to do.",1,1733861787.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

This script is part 4 in a series. It took me a long time to get around to writing this one. I think I had to be in a certain mood to write it. And even then, it wasn't the smoothest process. There are some things from my own past and present that I had to come to terms with as I tried to write this one. Very cryptic and vague, I know, but that's just your boy Blue.

I don't think this is ever going to get filled- I mean, come on, it's part 4 in a series- so fuck it, right? It's 3.3K words in length. You guys are welcome!

It's okay to monetize this script, make reasonable edits to it, as well as gender-flip it. All SFX and voice cues are optional- please don't feel pressured to incorporate them if you're filling this.

And, as always....your comments and feedback are welcome and appreciated. Even if I don't respond in the comments as often as I used to, they mean quite a lot to me. I return to them when I'm not feeling well, and I'll read them at the strangest of times. To everyone who has been following this series so far- thank you.

For the listener:

*There's something which has been weighing heavily on your mind these last few days. Even as you' step onto the roof of one of the many high-rises she owns, that weight doesn't leave you. You've waited all day to see her. Your ex-girlfriend. Your captor. There's somewhere you two are supposed to go. You don't really know where, and you don't really know what the night will bring you. But looking up at the sky, you have a feeling it's going to rain...*

**SCRIPT:**



*(SFX: Winds.)*

Good evening, rabbit. Although I suppose it is getting rather late.

How was the car ride over here? See anything interesting?

(Mildly amused) A cat? Where?

Oh. I see. That is unusual, yes. Seeing a random cat on a sidewalk in this city.

(Softly) Maybe it ran away from its owner. Who knows?

*(SFX: Winds. Again.)*

No, I’m not cold. You don’t have to give me your jacket. I’m used to the winds up here.

I do come up here often. Especially at this time of night. The view’s nice. Shame everything is in monochrome though.

Yeah. I, along with a few banks, own this building. Did you like the decor on your way up?

How lovely. And how are you feeling? My men weren’t too rough with you, were they? I told them to be extra careful while transporting my property.

Are you sure?

*(SFX: Heels clicking, as she steps closer)*

(Whispering) Let me see.

(Quietly, gently) Hm. No marks on your face. And no scruffs on your shirt and jacket.

Hold still for me, rabbit. I need to make sure my toy is undamaged. Do you understand?

Good.

(Slow, audible breathing) You aren’t wincing as I run my fingers over your body. As I feel you. You don’t seem to be in pain.

(Sighing) Fine. I suppose I’ll trust what you say. For now.

Can’t really unbutton your shirt for a more thorough examination up here now, can I? (Voice drops) And only because you’re not used to the cold. I don’t want you to get sick.

My men seemed nice to you? Is that so?

I see. Well, at least they made you feel comfortable. But don’t think of them as your buddies. They’re on my payroll.

No, rabbit. Not everyone in this city is on my payroll. I went to that stupid cafe yesterday, and they served me a latte with sugar. After I specifically told them not to do either of those things.

No. I didn’t get mad. I calmly asked them for a refund. But instead, they tried to give me a coupon for my next order. Can you imagine the nerve?

I should have that shop closed down. I’d be doing everybody a favour. Nobody likes their coffee except you. (Whispering) Nobody.

Oh, don’t give me those puppy-dog eyes. I haven’t even tied you to my bed yet. It’s too early in the night for that.

(Sighing) I know what you mean. Don’t worry, pet. Your precious coffee shop lives to see another day. I didn’t have anybody killed or maimed, either. Though I will admit I considered it for a second.

Hm? I didn’t quite get that.

You missed me?

(Sighing softly) Yeah. Of course you did. You’ve been so obedient lately. So docile. (Whispering) So very submissive.

My needy little bunny. Always clinging to your mistress.

Why would I be upset? Do you not know me at all?

No, my little pet. I’m quite pleased, if anything. I missed you too. (Pouting) I missed these pretty lips.

(Kissing him a few times)

(Sultry laughter) What? I missed your neck, too. You aren’t wearing your collar right now. I have to....leave *some* kind of mark to let people know you belong to me.

Yes. My lipstick is visible on your neck. But just to be sure- (kissing his neck again).

(Softly) There. My lipstick looks good on you, rabbit.

(Sighing) We do have a dinner reservation to get to. Come on. Take my hand.

Oh, it’s this little Italian restaurant on the other side of town. I booked Italian because- you know. My family’s roots, and all. Plus, I kind of like the cuisine. Very flavourful.

You haven’t been there before, actually. You’ll like it. You usually need to make prior reservations to get a table, but let’s just say the management and I have an understanding.

Now, are you ready to eat?

No? (Giggling) What’s that supposed to mean? My rabbit doesn’t have an upset tummy now, does he?

Oh? You’d like to....spend a few more minutes up here?

Oh. I see.

Yeah. We can do that. You know I can’t say no to those eyes. I fear you’ve found my weakness.

*(SFX: Heels clicking away)*

Come. Join me.

Yes. Near the railings. Don’t worry, you won’t fall off. (Soft, teasing) I’ll even hold your hand if you’re afraid.

Maybe not. Wow. You do still have a bit of a spark left in you, pet. I like that.

*(A longer pause. SFX: Winds, again.)*

You’re correct. It is a steep drop from here. But don’t look at the ground. Just look at the skyline with me. Between the earth and the sky, I’d always choose to look up at the sky.

I used to do that even back then, didn’t I? How nice of you to remember.

Yeah. I don’t mind. We can just hang out, I guess. Like when we were teenagers.

(Sighing) We won’t be late for anything. When I said “dinner reservations”, I meant us walking in, and them rushing to find us a private table. Who do you think you’re talking to?

Don’t apologize. I-I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just....a little hungry, I guess. But I don’t mind waiting a few more minutes. This view does put me in a certain mood.

(Soft) Oh, mostly just blank.

Tell me about your day. What were you up to when I wasn’t around?

Well, that’s not much, is it?

I know. You don’t like talking about yourself. But I don’t want you to just- to just pine away in my basement when I’m not there with you. I got you books to read, and video games so you don’t feel bored. I don’t keep you shackled to the bed all the time anymore. Only enough restraints to ensure my pet stays in his kennel.

Or rather, in his hutch. You know, because you’re my rabbit.

What? You’re even allowed to wander around certain sections of the estate in my absence, as long as you’re under the supervision of one of my men.

(Her voice drops) I don’t care if it’s humiliating. You know the rules.

I want you to have your freedom. I want you to have privileges. But never forget I can take those away if I please, if the mood should so choose to strike me. (Whispering) If you should choose to disobey me.

I’m not an unreasonable woman. I only get possessive over what’s mine.

(Exhaling) I know you miss me. I haven’t been able to spend as much time with you as I’d like, lately. I’ve just been busy. (Softer) Perhaps I should reduce the dosage of your....medication. It’s making you feel lonelier.

Oh, it’s not the meds? Then what is it?

(Taken aback) Excuse me?

Pet....I....

It’s nothing. Sorry. Let’s just get back to watching the city.

I told you. Forget it. I’ll soon be able to spend more time with you. I’ll take you out on more dates. Just hold on a bit longer.

(Sighing) You never let go, do you? It’s one of your most annoying qualities. I wonder why I used to find it so endearing.

No. You didn’t say anything wrong. You just- well, you told me that exact thing about a year ago. Before you-

Yeah.

Of course I remember. It was hard to forget. You’d make up all these weird, corny and stupid statements to tell me how much you liked me. “I feel lonely, because my girlfriend won’t let me pour sugar in her coffee”. “I can’t go trekking north, because my compass always leads me back to her”. Oh, and my personal favourite, “My knees don’t turn weak around the woman I love; I just like kneeling.”

(A few moments of silence for the listener’s dignity...)

There’s no point cringing about it now. You said all those things, and they’re forever etched on my mind. I’ll never let you forget.

Not a chance.

If it’s any consolation- those did make me smile. You said I should smile more often, and I said no, and you- I guess you just took it upon yourself to make me smile.

Yeah. I did start smiling more often after you said that, didn’t I? But only around you.

I don’t know. You kept telling me how my smile always made your heart skip a beat. Made butterflies dance in your stomach, and all that jazz. I was never very good with the romantic stuff. I just thought you’d stay with me if I let you see my smile.

(Faintly) Wouldn’t have to watch you leave after our dates. Wouldn’t have to let go of your hand after you walked me home.

You know I didn’t like returning to my home. There was nobody inside. Only strangers in suits. The house was too big for me to live in.

(Scoffing) Please. That’s not why I *longed* for you to move in with me. I didn’t *long* for anything like that. Dummy. I just brought up the subject from time to time, because I thought living together for a trial period could be interesting.

I only had to bring it up multiple times because you....actually had the audacity....to pretend you were hesitant about moving in with me.

(Softer) I was way too patient with you. I always get what I want, the first time I ask for it. Else I just take it. But you- (sighing)

What reason did you give me again? Because you were nervous you’d mess things up with me if we started living together?

Oh. Right. *And* you were worried about living away from your family for the first time.

I’d have let you see your family, you know? It wouldn’t be like....(quietly) like the way it is now.

When was the last time you saw them?

So just before you disappeared, then?

Mhmn. They’re still alive. And they’re doing better now. Though they still haven’t stopped looking for you.

Do you miss being able to see your family?

I see. That sounds lovely. At least you still have a family.

Look at that. The Ferris wheel is still running. It must be their last ride for the day.

Oh no, I haven’t been on that wheel in forever.

I don’t resent it. I told you- I’ve just been busy. It was there that you finally decided to man up a bit. Why’d I resent it?

Yeah. We were at the top of the wheel. You looked out of our window and suddenly blurted out, “Natalia, my lady, I’ve been an idiot! Please, please let me move in with you! I love you so much! Please!”

Well, it’s close enough to what you actually said. I stopped listening after the first few words.

Because you....you were giving me that look. Staring at me with those puppy dog eyes. (Muttering) Didn’t even let me enjoy the view from the top.

What’s with the blush, rabbit? (Whispering) Did you just remember what we did for the rest of the night?

Awww. I was your first? Baby....I know. You had no clue. I had to teach you practically everything. I think I spent half the night just telling you what to do.

(Smiling softly) Then again, you always enjoyed following my instructions.

(With a sigh) You don’t have to point out the theatre to me. I know which one you’re talking about. What a wonderful way to change the subject.

Yes, pet. You took me there the morning after, to watch a movie. I don’t know what possessed you. I guess everyone just reacts differently to losing their vir-

Must you interrupt me? You know I don’t like it when you do that.

Oh, the movie was forgettable. I only went because I could cuddle you. And I thought it’d be fun, watching my rabbit eat popcorn out of my hands.

(Soft) What was I going to do at home by myself, anyway?

*(SFX: Winds)*

West of that theatre, behind all those buildings- right at the very edge of what we can see from here….lies my mother, six feet below the earth. And beside her, dad.

You really didn’t need to accompany me to the cemetery every six months, you know? It wasn’t going to rain every time I went there.

Wanted to show yourself off to my parents, did you? Have them see what kind of boy their daughter dragged in?

Oh, they wouldn’t have disapproved of you. (Very faintly) Quite the opposite, I think.

My mother only wanted what was best for me. Even dad did, in his own way, I think. And that, was you.

I made peace with my old man before he passed. I’d visit him often when he was in the hospital. I was the only person he didn’t pay to come and see him.

Time doesn’t care how rich or powerful you are, my little rabbit. Time just....moves on. It’s we who can’t.

My father had everything, but in the end, he was gripped by an incurable disease which slowly turned him into a shell of his former self. I thought it was some kind of cosmic justice- karma, if you will- for all those lives he’d destroyed. But no.

The universe is random. Worse men than him live happily till old age, and nicer men than him die before it’s their time. It’s not the stars that condemned my father. It was his own body giving up on him.

Not a single person came to see him just because they wanted to, you know. It was only his employees, the hospital staff, and the life support machines. In the end, those were all he had.

He had me too, huh? You think it really made a difference?

(A longer pause)

I see. I hope it is as you say. I hope I was able to bring a flicker of light and joy into his life. (Unsteady) I....I didn’t want him to hurt in his final moments. You know? He was....he was still my dad.

(Exhaling. Breathing slowly.)

(Calm, monotonic) I wonder if I’ll end up like him one day. Wasting away in a hospital bed, alone and forsaken. No voices of people but only the humming of machines. Unable to die, unable to recover. Just reliving memories from my life over and over again until I’m set free.

I wonder if I’ll end up like that.

(Sighing) I appreciate it, but you don’t know that, rabbit.

Yes. I do have you. For now.

(Whispering) I want to believe, but...there’s no guarantee you won’t run away.

I...I can’t trust you. And that kills me.

You promise?

(Sighing softly) My darling....you promised me the last time, too. And then you left.

I blamed myself for the longest time. I kept trying to think of what could’ve made you run away. What exactly was it that I did?

But it really wasn’t anything in particular, was it? You told me yourself. It….It was just the small things piling up, one after another. The work I did. The disagreements between us. The arguments. Buried feelings leading to miscommunication, miscommunication leading to misunderstandings, and the misunderstandings to alienation. I’d always had walls around my heart. But they never stopped you. I just failed to see when you slipped through the cracks, away from me.

I never wanted to hurt you. You were the only constant in my world. My treasure.

It’s okay. Don’t blame yourself. You can’t see the future. And neither can I. If I could, I’d have chained you to my bed forever after that first night.

Look at me.

You really are the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen. Simply precious. That jacket suits you. And you’re wearing the Rolex I got you. It looks really nice on your wrist.

What’s with that guilty expression, hm? Can’t I spoil my pet? When you’re with me, you don’t ever have to worry about money. (Whispering) Let the woman take care of things.

*(SFX: Heels clicking, as she steps closer)*

You really do look good. And you’re wearing that cologne I like. You even oiled and combed your hair. (Sighing)

*(SFX: Brief hair brushing)*

You know I like seeing your hair messy. Unruly. It suits you.

You’re quiet. What is it?

It’s not nothing. Come on, pet. I’ve known you for years.

I won’t be mad. Well, I’ll try (a tiny giggle).

(Gently) Just tell me.

Is that so?

Well, I agree you never should’ve left. Just look at what you missed out on for a whole year. But don’t worry. I won’t let you wander off again. I can see from my phone where you are at all times now. Do you remember why?

Mmnn. Because I had that tiny chip implanted under your skin, didn’t I? As any loving girlfriend should.

Pet?

(Sighing) I know. You told me that earlier. I’m sorry for how I reacted.

Oh, darling. I’ll never tire of hearing you say it. And I know you really do believe that you mean it.

Of course you believe you still love me. I’ve conditioned you. I’m the only person in your life now. If you disobey me, you get punished. If you make me happy, you get rewarded. And hearing you say you love me, it....it does make me happy.

No, rabbit. Not this time. Those eyes you give me....(taking a deep breath....whispering) I won’t fall for them this time. Not when you say those words.

Do I still love you....?

(Breathing up close) Your tie’s loose....you still haven’t learnt how to wear one properly, have you?

Be still for me, pet. I won’t hurt you.

*(SFX: Soft rustling of fabric)*

(Very softly) As my property, you need to look presentable. And because you can’t take care of yourself....I’ll just have to take care of you.

Is it on too tight? (Giggling gently) Well, at least you can breathe comfortably enough.

You can think of the tie as your collar for the night, if you like. At least until we get home. I did put it on you myself.

I can’t drag you around by your leash in public, so....I’ll just hold your hand. Alright?

(Sighing softly) My darling. All dolled up for me. You really do look adorable. (Kissing the tip of his nose)

Come along, pet. *(SFX: Heels clicking slowly)*

*(SFX: Rain.)*

*(Heels stop)*

(Sighing again) Well this is just fantastic, isn’t it? It was windy earlier but I didn’t think it’d actually start raining.

This is just the worst....my hair and clothes are going to get all drenched now....

Hey! Now’s not really the time to space out. You can count the city lights later. For now, let’s just-

Yeah. You love me. I know. You wanted to say it to me at least once while we were both getting soaked in the rain, didn’t you? You had that on your bucket list. Your teenage self would high-five you right now if he could see you.

Well? Are you going to follow me inside, or do I have to-

(Rolling her eyes) Oh, babe....now’s *really* not a good time for this! Why are you kneeling down on the roof?

Pet?

That’s not even the proper way to kneel. You have to be down on both your knees to- to-

(Barely audible) What are you doing?

 I-I know what that is between your fingers, but....why are you....you can’t be- you can’t be serious....

No. This isn’t real. This cannot be real. There’s no way you would-

Where did you even get that ring? *When* did you get it? I never left you unattended.

Answer me. Where- when....*why?* Why do you have that ring with you?

You told me already?

But you- you can’t love me. I don’t let you see your family. I- I don’t even let you out by yourself. I-I...(shaky breathing)...I....don’t understand.

I’m your captor. Your ex-girlfriend who can’t let go of you. I’m a monster. You can’t actually....*want* to stay with me. Not after all this time.

Rabbit...? Did you just....?

I can’t answer that.

I can’t. I....I want you more than anything else in the world. I want to trust you. I do. But I can’t- I can’t let myself get hurt again. Not by you.

I could never heal from that. I would....I would be washed away in this rain. Dissolved into the night.

Don’t do this to me. Please.

Don’t give me hope.

Will I marry you....? I don’t- I....I hate the rain.

I just hate it so much, you know? It always gets in my eyes. Always. It’s so hard to see. But I still....

I can see you. You’re not a ghost. You’re still that boy. Where were you? Where were you hiding from me?

Rabbit. I....

Yes.

Hopefully, not just wages. Too often our required suppliers are far more expensive then buying retail. £70 (yes really) for 1kg of Nescafe instant coffee. Over £500 each for  printers (without support) that i ordered for £216 direct from HP.

The Delonghi ones look quite nice?

Wondering what others have? My only requirement is bean to cup! And not more expensive than my voucher! ",2,1733861625.0,AskUK,15,0.75,False

Had different accounts (all very different personalities) donate large bits from time to time, and the ones that are 5k upwards always get clipped by one or two accounts with the same name (but different to the person donating). 

I never see them lurking in the stream so it's like it's done with the vod as opposed to during. 

Not sure how this would work but wondering if anyone else has noticed the same. Current user for the latest clips is named 'PastryCoffee' ",0,1733861589.0,Twitch,5,0.5,False

My photos are not blurred. I opened the app right before my tour in Europe/Middle East. These are men I met, matched with, or we traumatized each other.

Starting in America:

American #1: Afghan guy (35) who took me to lunch and we hit it off - so I thought. Never heard from him again 

American #2: Sudanese guy (31) who I didn’t meet but spoke with over the phone. Was super nice but he has a restraining order on his ex wife. I’m scared.

American #3: Iranian guy (47) who drove 9 hours to meet me but said he was going to make the drive anyways for something else. He surprised me with my favorite perfume, flowers, and a hand written note. We went to hot pot and he berated the waiter which made me uncomfortable. I tried to make a clean getaway as he dropped me off at my brothers place and he came face to face with my brother. He introduced himself and invited himself in and told offensive jokes for 2 hours. Ironically, he cut me off for not being “warm.”

Now let’s go to the matches when I visited different parts of Europe:

Norway guy #1: Lebanese (31) he lovebombed me: I’ll do this and spoil you and you’ll never have to work etc before we even met. When it was time to meet, he gave me an address……to his house. I blocked him

France #1: Moroccan (39) he was very intense and we met up for coffee. He talked about himself for 45 minutes before I was finally able to get a word in. He got mad I interrupted him. We didn’t talk again.

Sweden #1: Afghan (32) a doctor who’s photos were blurred. I’m not a shallow person but he didn’t want to share his photos until we got to know each other. When he finally did, I realized he wasn’t my type physically. Before I could reject him, he asked if I was still “pure” despite being divorced. I blocked him.

UK (London): Pakistani (32) we matched and spoke over learning Arabic. He was funny but would get angry if I didn’t pick up the voice calls on Muzz despite being in the middle of something. “If I call you, you answer.” Didn’t work out.

UK (London): Bengali (38) we didn’t meet but we messaged. I was in London during the storm and asked him about the possibility of flights being canceled as I was worried about getting home. He said “who cares? Do I seem like the type to baby you?” Blocked him 

UK (London): Afghan (37) guy who was in the same part of London and was pushy about meeting up. He said he’s going to have an early dinner with his family first then meet me for coffee (I am a late coffee drinker) or lassi. I didn’t eat so I was looking for a place to eat. By the time I did, he was done with dinner. I asked if he wanted to keep me company while I ate and he said no. An hour later, I asked which coffee house and said he rather we “chill and drive” around London. Blocked him immediately the second I saw the world chill.

UK (London): Afghan/pakistani (47) he wanted to meet the day I flew in and I was jet lagged so I asked if we could meet the following day. He agreed, I took a nap, and woke up to 15 missed muzz calls. His messages asked why I played him since he cleared his day for me. He was bad at listening.

Let’s go to the Middle East and Turkey:

Turkey #1: Kurdish guy (35) who was very handsome. He spoke English well via the app. We met at taksim square for coffee and we spoke through a translator. I had chemistry with google translate. 

Kuwait #1: Kuwaiti guy (34) made racist comments about me being Afghan. 

UAE: Afghan/Turkish (34) guy who I matched with. We talked on video call before meeting up. We have a second coffee date planned soon. Looks promising ❤️
