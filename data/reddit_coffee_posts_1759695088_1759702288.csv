However, I'm disinclined to message them because I'm intimidated by profiles that are like ""Take me somewhere fun!"". Except I don't know anywhere like that. I barely dine out, and it's usually at a chain. I don't go to bars or coffee shops. My third spaces are the gym, movie theater, and 10 miles into the forest.

Would I just be happier going full espresso machine? I really enjoy nice iced lattes from local spots in SW MI and I would be ecstatic to get a similar drink from home.

It’s seemingly complex and emotional to think where we would be if 10 years ago never tore us apart. Part of me thinks right person, wrong time. Yet that implies I’m ok with the riff that transpired. What I am thankful for is the person I’ve transformed to be inside and out. Whom found herself and her voice. Something you’re not accustom to, but you’ve learned to appreciate the safe space I’ve held. 

You too have transformed. You’re more emotionally intelligent than you give yourself credit for. The thing is, you were never “allowed” to flourish until you met your counterpart (me) whom could show you it’s ok to sit and feel….and be safe in those feelings. Happiness. That’s all I’ve required of you. For yourself and by yourself. I’m proud of you for your career and so many other things. 

I can’t help but think how many hand written letters I could’ve had by now. How many times I would’ve woken up next to you on a Sunday morning, messy hair and all, just to kiss you on the forehead and sneak out of bed to start coffee and breakfast for you. What house would we have by now and where? Kids? Sure, if you wanted one/them. Do we travel often for sunset and waterfall pictures like we use to? And how many Cannon memory cards have you filled with photos like you use to do. Gosh I remember you taking pictures with that think like it was gonna explode if you didn’t hold it. Or what about our country back road jam sessions to Swift? God forbid. One section on repeat because the xm radio
Signal froze and we just kept singing along.

All we have is time…. 9 years down… and I’m affraid and perplexed. Sitting next to you just for 10 minutes showed me the shift in energy to what it use to be. Your words written in the void show me she’s still there. When asked again why I love you. I just do. Always have. Always will. Always. 

That being said…where would we have been now? Or where could we be now? Only the one in the driver seat knows.

(Starts here) How it started was he added me on instagram and we never communicated because I never posted and he would post but I never text first, anyways fast forward I thought he was cute and gathered up the courage to like his story and a week later I noticed that I got added to his close friends and I just responded to a post he had made on there because clearly it seemed like we both were interested in getting to know each-other (spoiler alert, we were) and we started talking 

We ended up calling on the first day of texting and our call lasted 5-6 hours and we overshared a lot, and honestly it was like this for the next 3 days and then he had exams and got busy and couldn’t make the time to call, and I never suspected anything because despite him being really good looking he had never kissed or been with a girl before and he seemed like a family guy, he just sounded so serious and he was really charming. Moreover I had told him about my past issues regarding relationships and how I have severe trust issues and what not and literally a day later he had unfollowed like 100 people, which made me fall for him harder. Anyways we exchange texts back and forth and slowly he starts becoming really inconsistent with texting me back and says he wouldn’t be active on instagram because of his exams and he would leave me on delivered while posting stories and what not, it really
rubbed me the wrong way and I should have seen signs earlier but I digress. 

Anyways moving on he had asked to meet with me and go out, but in a very “non-chalant” way like he didn’t directly ask me out but just asked if I wanted to grab coffee with him. I said yes, and he sounded pretty ecstatic about it but got dry again after a day or so. The longest he would leave on delivered for would be like a day maybe 2 which I deemed as normal but it got longer recently, like 5-6 days with no texting and I got suspicious. 

So as girls do, I start stalking his following on his private and I see this girl he had added and got really suspicious, and I had a gut feeling that I wasn’t the only girl he was talking to and tonight I made the decision to block him, but I still have him added on snapchat. I don’t know if he’ll text me on there regarding this.

(A little bit about me, which may be relevant) I’ve had one ex who has given me a lot of trust issues, and I don’t wanna be in the same situation again.

TL;DR Anyways I’m really hurting as of now and I’ve cried so much because I’m really picky and I truly do get attached very easily and fall deeply for someone when I really like them, and It’s my first time cutting a guy off. Has anybody been in a similar situation? If so, please give me advice on what to do regarding this matter.",1,1759701135.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

Original post: 
""Let me start by saying that I clean for this family 5 days a week. 
The house is a DISASTER 
Every. Single. Day. 
And every day, I'm doing the same thing. Not just cleaning up the children's mess but the adults as well.
The espresso machine is left absolutely filthy. Coffee grinds spilled everywhere. 
The stove top is cleaned daily, now covered with splattered oil and spills/food everywhere. 
Dishes do not get rinsed. They are left piled for me. 
Diapers left on the floor or even chewed up diapers left for me to clean up... 
Literally, I could go on and on. 
I do ALL the laundry for this family, fold and put away.

 Okay fine, I don't mind the duties, it's the mess that I mind because I feel like a maid at this point.


The duties in addition that I'm getting asked to do are organizing, organizing the pantry. Organizing the closets in room. Cleaning the fridge. Cleaning the bathrooms. (keep in mind all of these things are filthy by the time they ask me to do them) Washing the couch covers and putting them on (a bloody nightmare) Mopping the area where their dogs frequently pee. 

Just an example, say they are throwing something into the trash and they miss. They literally leave it there. Same applies to bathroom trash. 

I want to scream it into the void. I leave this house tidy every day.
Only to show up to a home that looks like a tornado ran through it. Clothes left scattered in kids room, the adults leaving their clothes and shoes piled everywhere. Drinks scattered about. Literally the adults are just as messy as the children. Ughhhh...

I need this job. 
If I could get more cleaning clients , I could probably soley do my side hustle of cleaning on my own full time. 
Instead, I'm over here being a family's b****, I mean servant. 🤣




Update: I went in today as usual to the same scenario. After sharing my frustration here and receiving your advice, I'm seeing this family for what they are. Entitled people taking advantage of me. My rate is too low and I appreciate you guys letting me know that. I hope to have a better update for you guys moving forward...""

Coffee stains from using it early in the morning poetry sessions. Had to be hung up to dry after folding it up and putting it in my front right pocket and then getting sweaty from chasing tail. A piece fell from chaffing against my bag. Ink starting to fade I have no idea how that happened. Maybe like a memory. Any other man would have put it in a protective case, I mean I would have put it in a protective case had I known it was the last print but I'm glad that I used it.

A heart made out of stone. A chisel made out of bone, a hammer made from broken thrones, a poem written like spoken words, strike the stone, to doubt the strength of bone against stone would be to rebuild those thrones.

Eventually it'll be able to break itself free, and there will never be a fee for chipping away. The work is already paid so it's not hard to walk away.

Survivors who are in a trap now have a wiggle timer and are faced with a barrage of skill checks, similar to merciless storm, failing skill checks reduces the wiggle timer, succeeding enough skill checks will cause survivors to break free

When a survivor is stuck in a trap, trapper now gains a 7.5% haste bonus for 5 seconds, this is also affected by coffee grounds, but does NOT stack with the haste given by placing traps, placing a trap only resets the timer

Grabbing a survivor out of a trap is now treated as an ""interrupt and grab"" action, this not only increases the speed significantly since the animation is shorter, but also contributes to ""interrupt and grab"" quests

At the start of the trial, trapper now has a full inventory of traps, and can now hold a maximum of 4 (or maybe 6??) traps, to compensate for the extra traps he spawns with, 2 traps are removed from the realm

Trapper bag now increases the maximum inventory to 6 (or maybe 8?) and trapper starts with the additional inventory slots filled, these additional traps increase the maximum numbers of traps as well, they do NOT take away from the realm",1,1759700646.0,deadbydaylight,0,0.66,False

I wanted to take a moment and pour my thoughts out on this journey of trying to build something out of nothing. I'm sure many of you can relate to the late nights where you find yourself staring at the screen, coffee cup in hand, wondering if your last few bucks are well-spent.

I started my e-commerce venture full of hope, ready to tackle the world. But soon enough, I found myself pivoting again and again, thinking I'd cracked the code with a feature only to see no one cared. The old saying of building in a vacuum hit all too close to home. 

There's this constant buzzing doubt that maybe this isn't a real business but just a shiny project that only I love. Yet, a small part of me can't help but believe in what I'm building, even when it feels like others are shipping faster and making noise while I'm struggling to get that first meaningful traction.

It's a dance between discouragement and belief, and every pivot feels like losing, not learning. There's this tug-of-war I'm caught in. Do I quit and save myself the constant stress? Or do I push forward, hoping it'll all click into place?

One thing that's helped me is consistency in creating content. I recently stumbled upon tools like HypeCaster that automate video creation. It's been a game changer to keep my content game strong without it sucking hours out of my week.

Has anyone else been in this spot? How did you decide when it was time to call it quits or go harder? Would love to hear your stories and tips. Thanks for listening.

1nz0yoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/newgradnurse/comments/1nz0yoz/lifestyle_creep_to_avoid_as_a_new_grad_nurse/,Lifestyle Creep to Avoid as a New Grad Nurse,"# What Is Lifestyle Creep?

According to Fidelity, *lifestyle creep* happens when someone gets a raise, bonus, or new job (hello, new grad nurses!) and instead of keeping the same spending habits, they start **upgrading their lifestyle** because they’re earning more.

The problem? Even though you’re making more money, you end up with **less—or no—savings at all.**

As a new grad nurse back then (late 2000's yeah Im old! ), here are the *lifestyle creeps* I wish I had avoided:

# 1. Buying or Leasing Expensive Cars

You know what I did? I *leased a freaking Porsche* back in 2015 because I got overconfident with my side hustle income. Unfortunately, I had to return it after just 2 weeks because I got divorced during that time. Lost my $5,000 down payment.Then, I did it **again** in 2022 with an expensive Tesla Model Y lease. Now I’m stuck paying **$800 a month** for a car I’ll never own. Thank God this lease will be done in a few months.

# 2. Grocery Overspending and Food Waste

Buying food without a plan or budget. I’d go grocery shopping with no list, overspend, and end up letting food rot in the fridge. I wish I had been more intentional with food—honestly, I’ve wasted *so much*.

# 3. Too Much Food Delivery

I used to order food to work at least **3 times a week** just because I was too lazy to make food for lunch. Aside from the cost, it was *so unhealthy*. Eating takeout that often caused me to gain weight—and half of it the food I ordered doesn't even taste good.

# 4. Paying for Subscriptions I Don’t Use

Gym memberships, streaming services like Hulu, random apps I barely open. I kept telling myself, “It’s only $10 here and there,” but those little charges *add up fast.*

# 5. Buying Things to Impress Other People

My friends loved clubbing and Vegas trips, and I got guilt-tripped into joining even though I didn’t really enjoy those things. I wish I had realized sooner that **I don’t have to spend money to fit in**—especially on stuff that doesn’t align with who I am.

# 6. Saying Yes to Every Invitation

Weddings, bachelorette parties, baby showers—you name it, I said yes. Without ever checking my budget.We all know these events cost money. According to *The Knot*, the average cost to attend a wedding in 2024 was **$610**, up $180 from five years ago. And if you’re a bridesmaid? [*Brides.com*](https://Brides.com) says it can cost **$1,500–$2,500** for a local wedding—more for destination ones.

# 7. Having Amazon on Speed Dial

This one is my weakness. For me, it’s all about **convenience**. If something can make my life “easier,” it’s instantly in my cart. As a busy nurse and mom, I justify it by saying, *“It helps me stay organized”* or *“It keeps my kid busy.”* But honestly, it’s caused me to overspend and clutter the house in the name of “making life easier.”

# 8. Alcohol Upgrades

As I started making more money (and got older), my taste in alcohol leveled up too. Gone were the days of cheap beer and $1 tequila shots—now it’s premium wine and cocktails that cost as much as dinner.

# How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep

# 1. Budget, Budget, Budget

I never used to budget. I thought I was *decent with money* until I actually started tracking it. Seeing where every dollar goes is a wake-up call.Without a budget, it’s easy for your paycheck to disappear. Real numbers don’t lie, you need to see how much is coming in, how much is going out, and what’s actually being saved or invested.

2. Set Clear Goals

I wish I had set financial goals early in my career. Even if you’re young and unsure about your future, it helps to have *benchmarks.*

For example:

* By 30: $500k in retirement + brokerage accounts
* By 40: $1 million total investments

Life gets busy, especially as a nurse juggling work and family. Setting **concrete, measurable goals** keeps you focused and prevents wishful thinking.

# 3. Run the Numbers Before Buying Anything

People advised me things like, *“Lease a car—it’s a tax write-off!”* or \*“You can afford it—you work hard!”\*That mindset got me into two expensive car leases with barely any tax write-off compared to the huge cost and some credit card debt. Don’t let guilt or FOMO convince you that you “have to” spend.

# 4. Be Intentional

Ask yourself: *Does this really add quality to my life?* Am I buying this for convenience, validation, or genuine happiness?I’m not perfect, but now I think twice before spending my hard-earned RN paycheck.

# Lifestyle Creep I Still Allow (But Manage Wisely)

Even as a 40-year-old [**Per diem PACU nurse**](https://henrynurse.com/pacu-nurse-from-a-pacu-nurse/), I still enjoy a few lifestyle upgrades—but I do it *intentionally.*

**Travel** – I use **credit card points** for most flights and sometimes hotels.

**Coffee Shop Visits** – Once every 2 weeks at my favorite local spot.

**Dining Out** – Once a week with my family, but I research restaurants for discounts or reward programs.

**Grocery Upgrades** – I now buy food I actually eat. I’ve become more health-conscious and shop more organic food.

**Final Thoughts**

Lifestyle creep happens to the best of us, especially when we finally start earning a real nurse paycheck after years of working hard in nursing school. But the good news is you can control it. Being mindful of where your money goes, setting goals early, and budgeting with intention will help you actually keep and grow the income you work so hard for. So yes, treat yourself once in a while because you deserve it, but remember your future self will thank you more for saving than spending.",2,1759700370.0,newgradnurse,0,0.75,False

Here are five simple ways you can improve your gut health from Good Housekeeping’s Dr Mo Khaki.

he science is still evolving, but one thing is abundantly clear: a [happy gut](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/health/a63735570/diy-gut-health-test/) really is the foundation of health. Your intestines are home to trillions of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms. This ecosystem – known as your gut [microbiome](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/health/health-advice/a63826693/probiotics-gut-health/) – not only plays a crucial role in your digestive health but also in your metabolism, immunity and even mental health. If you want to be proactive about your journey to better health, it really is one of the most important areas to focus on. So, how can you make sure you’re supporting yours?

# Cater for all your microbes

You might already know that we should limit ultra-processed food and red meat for better health, and this includes gut health – but it’s also really important to eat a diverse range of foods. Different gut bacteria thrive on different foods, so a varied diet fosters a richer microbiome. I recommend a rainbow of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and seeds to maximise microbial variety. Ferments such as kimchi and sauerkraut nourish your good bacteria, but proceed with caution – fermented foods can contain histamine, which might trigger symptoms in sensitive individuals. Introduce them gradually and monitor your response.

Landing on a Friday, in time for weekend shopping, a weekly update on the GH style team’s top fashion and beauty buys.



**Tip**: Load up on berries, dark chocolate, green tea and olive oil, which all contain polyphenols, a nutrient that acts as fuel for your gut bacteria.

# If you’re a coffee drinker, you’re in luck!

Coffee is gut health’s secret hero – drinking it is one of the easiest ways to boost the health of your microbiome. Studies suggest coffee increases levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria – a healthy bacterium that helps digest fibre and prevent infections. The perfect dose is two to three cups daily. If you enjoy coffee but the caffeine makes you feel anxious or jittery, research suggests that decaf is likely to be just as good for you.

**Tip**: Drinking coffee on an empty stomach can cause acid reflux, so it’s best enjoyed after breakfast. Opt for black coffee or a splash of milk, but skip the sugary syrups and artificial sweeteners.

# Sleep more, drink less

Yes, your gut is another reason to get quality sleep. Poor sleep disrupts gut bacteria, increasing inflammation and digestive issues. In fact, studies show that a lack of sleep alters gut microbiota composition, negatively affecting metabolism and immune function. Drinking too much alcohol can also reduce diversity in your gut and shift the balance of bacteria in harmful ways. So, get to bed earlier, aiming for seven to nine hours a night – and think about reducing the amount you drink.

**Tip**: Moderate ‘diet’ drinks. Many sugar substitutes, such as aspartame and sucralose, may harm gut bacteria, and studies suggest that artificial sweeteners can alter gut microbiota. If you need a sweetener, consider natural alternatives, such as honey or stevia, in moderation.

# Give your medicine cabinet a makeover

Common medications can lead to an unhappy gut as they disrupt the delicate balance of bacteria. Ibuprofen, aspirin and other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can damage the gut lining and increase inflammation. If you do need a painkiller, paracetamol might be a better option. Antibiotics, while lifesaving, kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria – definitely not good for your gut. If you need to take a course, then eat probiotic-containing foods, such as yogurt and cheese, as these help maintain your gut balance.

**Tip**: Consider taking a high-quality probiotic supplement (possibly containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) two hours after medication to help restore balance to your microbiome.

# Go for fast fibre hacks

Most people don’t eat enough fibre – 90% of us fall short of the recommended intake. Fibre feeds beneficial bacteria, regulates digestion and prevents inflammation. Instead of taking supplements, make simple swaps: black beans have the highest fibre content of all beans, so add them to salads or soups; the humble green pea is a great source of fibre and also contains other gut-friendly nutrients; and raspberries give a surprisingly high fibre boost, with about 8g in one serving!

**Tip**: Incorporate resistant starches, found in cold cooked potatoes, green bananas and legumes. These ferment in the gut, encouraging growth of good bacteria.

# Final thoughts

Your gut health plays a vital role in your overall wellbeing, influencing digestion, immunity and even mood. By increasing fibre, probiotics, polyphenols and sleep, while cutting back on artificial additives, medications and ultra-processed foods, you can cultivate a thriving microbiome and achieve the ultimate goal in gut health: to create a diverse and thriving gut microbiome.

My mom (64F) wanted to help me feel better and planned a little weekend getaway for us to stay in a hotel at a nearby cute town. It’ll mostly be us walking around the town, buying coffees and window shopping. It’ll be from Friday - Sunday. She kindly insisted on paying for the hotel and driving us there.

So she calls me today and says something like, “The only time I’ll be able go to church on that Sunday we’re out of town is at 7pm once we’re back home, and that’ll be too late for me. So we’ll just have to go together Sunday morning at 10am!!”

She knows I’m not religious. She raised me Catholic, but I’ve shared with her multiple times that I’m not interested in Catholicism. She is very resistant to that though, and will usually say passive aggressive stuff around me and my other non-religious siblings about how our generation is abandoning the faith or whatever.

I didn’t really respond and just said something vague like, “Oh?” She then said something like “it’ll be easy since we’ll have to check out at 11am anyway, so we can just check out before church, put our suitcases in the car and then drive to mass.” And then the conversation quickly changed to a different topic.

I feel like she baited me into it. I’m angry because it was supposed to be a relaxing weekend for me, but now it just feels like her trying to ignore boundaries and push me into her faith (again).

I feel guilty pushing back though, since she’s paying for the hotel (and will most likely insist on paying for other things too like meals).

1nz0ro0,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nz0ro0/terrible_rules_and_policies/,Terrible rules and policies,"Hi all,

Burner account just in case - I have worked at a cafe chain in the UK known for its bakery items for 2-3 months now as a barista. In terms of coffee, the beans are specialty grade and we use really good equipment like Victoria Arduino machines and whatnot (however I still don't think it tastes amazing). 

Anyways, working at this shop is a personal hell for me. It is exceptionally busy and we have a '2 minute rule' where an order must be ticked off the screen within 2 minutes. When quiet, this is perfectly doable but that is never the case. Orders Stack up, the layout is sometimes confusing to look at and timers just keep ticking. It was stressful, so I decided to ignore it a little and just take things at my own pace because I don't want to give anyone the wrong drink or milk especially when allergies exist.

Despite this, my fellow staff are insistent on being absolutely sonic speed which leads to them ticking things off the screen and just going rogue and pulling shots for drinks when I don't even know which drinks we are making (there are usually 2 people on bar). Also , there is no point to ticking orders off so quickly -  The company can see when you tick orders off quickly and then recall them, which lowers that store's 'coffee efficiency' rating. If it's too low there will be an intervention or something. I think this rule is just absurd and is asking for disasters and stress..

As well as this, staff send out some really dodgy drinks when it's busy because they are too focused on time rather than quality. I've seen 90 second (yes, 90 second) shots be sent out and cappuccinos without a lick of foam on top. I enjoy making good drinks especially for a customer who has paid their hard earned cash for it.

Not to mention the fact the shop is understaffed as the corporate people are trying to maximize profit, and even though my job role is barista I'm pretty sure I've done every single job in that bakery at one point.

Has anyone got any similar experiences or coworkers that make the job a lot harder for them? I'm hoping I'm not alone here. Just needed to vent about this",2,1759699903.0,barista,4,0.75,False

I asked him if he wanted to grab coffee to catch up on life (and maybe see if something is there romantically) he enthusiastically said yes. We planned a week in advanced the time and place. We agreed on early afternoon at a local cafe on a Saturday.

I message him Friday night, at 7 pm. He never answers. I wait until noon (he doesn't reach out at all prior) to tell him I'm making other plans because of his radio silence. He answers immediately that he ""fell asleep early"" and ""had a sore throat."" (Excuses that I've heard before) Even though his social media time stamped him at being online at 1 am and 10 am.

1nz0pzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nz0pzr/mom_josie_lillian_alice_brenda/,"Mom, Josie, Lillian, Alice, Brenda","

They came back to me after I turned fifty. 

 

Mom died in 2014 from a heart attack- completely unexpected and sudden. I don’t think I ever actually got over it, although of course life went on, and things became fine. 

 

Josie is my best friend who died at the start of the pandemic- we know each other from school, we went through college together, and even as the full force of hectic adult life struck us, we never fell out of touch. 

 

Lillian is my old schoolmate– she died in her sleep when she was seventeen. I think they also said heart failure or something- that was many many years ago- I had mostly forgotten about her, so I was surprised when her saw her young unblemished face back in my life, but of course I recognized her instantly. 

 

My cousin Alice, killed in a car accident on her way to pick up her kids. Poor Alice. I felt so bad for the. And her eldest just getting into college. I sent around meals – casseroles and mac ‘n’ cheese, but not having a mom at that age? So hard. 

 

And my colleague, Brenda who died from cancer six months before retirement. She had helped me when I was just getting started in this job. She’d been dead for almost nine years by the time I hit fifty- did she die before or after Mom? I couldn’t remember telling Mom about Brenda, so probably after. 

 

All the women I had known and loved, back with me, in my house. 

 

I am not delusional, suffering from psychosis caused by missing them so much. Nor is this metaphoric. I see them, very clear, not all the time, but sometimes, And even when I’m not seeing them, I know they are there. I don’t speak to them, since I am not delusional and I respect the boundaries between the spirit world and ours. 

 

They occupy space in my house without bothering each other. I remember how upset Mom was when Lillian, my schoolfriend died. She was only seventeen- oh I already told you that, yes. Mom was upset of course, but she was also worried that Lillian’s sudden death would impact my studies- distract me. She told me, the sunlight in our kitchen gleaming off her gold-rimmed glasses, that Lillian would not want to see me crying, and to concentrate on my math exam next Tuesday. Lillian would be happy if I got a good grade. She poured me a coffee, I think my first grown-up cup of coffee, and I felt welcomed into the adult world. I still remember the taste of that coffee. 

 

I passed the exam, with an A, actually. Now Mom and Lillian glance at each other in the kitchen- a different kitchen, but Mom still wears those gold-rimmed glasses. Lillian seems shy of Mom, much as I remember she had been in real life, all those years ago, when we were both little girls. I don’t blame her, Mom could be quite a formidable presence- in fact, she still is. 

 

Brenda is by the window. Another formidable presence! She helped me deal with that toxic workplace bully. I was so grateful. She taught me so much. Always so generous with her time. A good colleague is like a sister, honestly.  “We got this!” she used to say, bustling into the office in her slightly outdated skirt suits.  Although she’s a ghost now, and thus not given much to talking, if at all, I can still hear her say it, when I catch sight of her, wearing those tailored office suits and pants with chunky jewelry. 

 

I am happy to see them all, be with them all. I’d love to tell cousin Alice her kids are grown and doing well at life, if I could. Her face is peaceful, so I think she knows. I do wonder why she chooses to spend time with me, rather than her children, but I guess it makes sense, when you think about it. Same with Brenda. Although I don’t think Brenda had much family- I remember her memorial “celebration of life” quite well and it was mostly colleagues. We talked about it at the time. Well, Brenda is more than welcome to spend whatever time she wants in my home.  

 

And Josie- I missed her most of all. Friends are the family we choose, right? We laughed so much together, reliving our memories from college. She’s dead, I’m alive, but we have so much in common otherwise! Sure, I can make new friends now, go to a local meetup group, hiking pickleball sketching singing but I won’t have those memories of growing up together, going to school, weddings and children and all that with these new friends, will I?  

Years passed. I lived a quiet life, in my darkening years, and Mom, Brenda, Alice, Lillian and Josie were right there with me. Some people would remark that I must be lonely, but why would I be? I had the women whom I loved the most with me in my house. True, I am not making new memories with them like we used to, but after all, there is nothing much new under the sun, only love and friendship remain. I’m not going to claim it was as it had been when they were alive, it is different, I know that! 

 

One day, I had to get a wheelchair. Mom’s face changed a little that day I returned from the hospital on a wheelchair- I saw the change. It had been many years since her death, and in all those years her face had stayed the same. But when she saw me in my wheelchair, her face changed. I wished so much then I could talk to her, tell her it was ok, I was ok. Lillian, Josie, Alice and Brenda didn’t change, but then as Mom would say, a mother’s love is different.  

 

Anyway, there was nothing I could so about it, I needed a wheelchair, and I needed at-home care and that was that. Sammie started visiting me, to care for me, you know how it is, to help me with cleaning and meals and things. Because my place wasn’t exactly what you would call wheelchair accessible. I was on some sort of list to move into another place that was, and I wondered if Mom, Lillian, Brenda, Josie and Alice would move in with me when that came through. I didn’t ask Sammie, it wasn’t the sort of question you could ask people, and I would find out soon enough anyway.  

 

Mom and Brenda didn’t like Sammie at all, even though I thought Sammie took good care of me, feeding me when my hands were too shaky, cleaning up after me, chatting away. Lillian liked him, so did Josie and Alice. But Mom and Brenda- their faces twisted up when he came over. And he came over more and more, I needed more care after all, and sometimes he would be tired from caring for me- I understood that. I understood being tired and fatigued. I tried not to do anything that would make Sammie extra-tired, but I couldn’t help it, my hands shook and I spilled the tea. Sammie was a bit rough- I'm sure he didn’t mean to be. I saw Mom watching him handling me and I felt scared- of Sammie or Mom?  

 

Brenda was by the window but then she turned and moved towards us, me in the wheelchair, Sammie bent over me, wiping the tea and scolding me and perhaps hurting me a bit, the way he was scrubbing with the towel, and I saw Brenda’s face, she had the same look as when she helped me deal with that toxic workplace bully so many years ago, her lips pressed against each other. Brenda and Mom were close upon us now.  

 

I wanted to call out to Sammie, to be careful, but it was too late- Mom and Brenda crashed into him and he dropped to the floor, motionless.  Josie and Lillian and Alice and I stared at Sammie’s corpse. Mom told me to call 911 because Sammie had a heart attack, and I did.

1nz0pna,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1nz0pna/a_few_things_about_friendship_2024/,A few things about Friendship - 2024.,"**Spoilers ahead!** I'm not even sure where to start, maybe this is more just a movie discussion. I've read different discussions around the movie, and I understand it is a comedy and that some people feel it's not ""that deep"" and doesn't warrant discussion like this! That's fine, but I'd like to know other people's thoughts.

>!1. To the point: I can see where his wife is coming from when she says she's leaving her narcissistic husband. He was totally disinterested in her life and his family's life, didn't remember even basic information about her, etc. She was tired of him, obviously, by the time we see their interactions in the film.!<

>!But am I off base to think she was kind of awful to him too? Like multiple times he'd ask her to do something or try to make plans, and she'd reject him for plans. He's want to go/be involved. Then she'd say, ""I didn't know you were free."" but literally right before that, it was pretty obvious that he was free because he was trying to make plans.!<

>!2. My boyfriend mentioned that the whole movie seemed like a metaphor for addiction. Watching someone get into addiction and then spiral out of control. Destroying his life even when he was getting everything he wanted back, because he just couldn't say no to his fix. We see him obsess over the neighbor, take up smoking, start drinking more and more frequently (he's shitfaced when he tries to take his wife for dinner) and then straight up tries toad lol.!<

>!He gets a chance to have his life back, stops indulging in his fixation on the neighbor, and then he just can't help himself and goes right back to it. Anyone else have that idea? What do you think of the theory? It for sure fits the behavior of some people I've known in my life. There are people with addictions who steal, cheat, and hurt others in the process of destroying their lives, and ones that don't. In this case, he obviously would be one that does.!<

>!3. This is just a thought I had. He's such a relatable character in the beginning. Having his full coffee and trying not to spill it on the way to his desk, fumbling through social interactions, not really getting the rules. And you see him that way for the whole beginning of the film, and I can see how some people would give him the benefit of doubt even further in. I've known men like that, who seem sad, pitiful, everyone is so mean to them, life is too cruel to them, etc. But...!<

>!He makes every choice to serve himself and his feelings. He doesn't misunderstand the rules during the boxing with the guys. He's mad, you can see it on his face- he's mad the other guy hit him in the face when he said not to, so he gets pissed and hits him back.!<

>!He breaks into his house, which is absolutely just a feeling of entitlement. Not a silly goofy pitiful guy doing something without realizing how wrong it is. I have known people who do this kind of thing (break into your room when you're gone, go through your things, because they feel entitled and can justify it with whatever reason they come up with).!<

>!His wife goes missing (because of him!) and he doesn't even search for her in his free time. He tries to give a speech to 'celebrate her return' but the only person he doesn't let talk is her. I don't even think he really misses his family as much as he misses the life he built with them. It feels like he wants to have his things, but when he gets a chance to reconnect and maybe get his family back, better than before, he once again chooses himself over all else, and even destroys the brand new van.!<

>!As if to say, the gesture was meaningless to him. He didn't care about it, or his ex-wife, her feelings or needs, more than his own. Even after all of this.!<

>!A ramble to say, he wasn't clueless or uncertain. He was selfish, and uncaring, even though the movie portrays him as a little of both. I've seen tons of people leaning towards clueless and awkward when describing him, but I disagree, and the boxing scene is one where its easy to feel like you can relate, like you've been in his shoes. But that's just because that's how he portrays himself, when in reality, he was being deliberately hurtful out of anger. Not misguided or confused.!<",3,1759699773.0,movies,1,0.64,False

I feel like Im being manipulated and i need clarity 

There's more info in other posts but here's a simplified version- I have BPD and trauma, trust issues and depression. I've been dating a guy for around two months now. He's been perfect almost eerily. At times it seems a tad ingenuine and I've been trying to control my trust issues on top of his behavior that I've never experienced before

I told him from the beginning I value honesty, transparency and respect. I found out recently he's been deleting texts and hiding convoys with his girl friends and lying to my face for a month about it. Saying I'm the love of his life while knowing the thing i value most is honesty and communication

I confronted him. He's said he cries a ton the other times he thought we'd break up, during the confrontation he said sorry but was deadpan. I really laid into him and was cruel so I can kind of understand

Now, these past two months I've split on him multiple times. I've accused him of cheating but then would apologize these are the things I'd say: 

I feel like you're cheating, you have so many girl friends and it makes me uncomfortable, I know somethings up, are you lying, I don't know if I can do this, I'm not healed enough for this, I feel like somethings up, I'm sorry, I'll try

He would reassure me every time that it's OK and we can work through things. I said sorry and said I'd keep trying. HE then suggested that he wouldn't talk or hang out one on one with his girl friends. I thought, well he's the one who suggested it and maybe it would help

I went through his phone with his consent a month in and found he was asking a woman who works at one of the event here goes to out for coffee. He says he does that with his friends all the time. I thought it was a bit of a red flag and got upset but ultimately tried to let it go and give the benefit of the doubt

Now, after all of that and me finding his texts (he deleted texts off her asking to come over, nothing sexual) he said he did it to protect me because he knew I'd ""read into it too much"". He did say sorry multiple times.  I said BS because I told him lying was the biggest violation to me..

We ended it with me breaking up basically. I broke down. I couldn't handle it. I called him and he ignored my call which has never happened. I spilt and said I needed him and we talked

He said that he told his friends everything (which i found odd because he was at work and I can't imagine he told them every detail in such a short amount of time) Apparently they all said I'm a manipulator and an abuser. Im not perfect but I would NEVER want to hurt anyone

I found out he was partying with all of his friends while activity texting me that he quote ""has to lay down, think on things and cry"" when he called he didn't sound sad at all, meanwhile I was balling my eyes out

He said that he lied because i manipulated him into it, saying it was a ""reactive response"" to me questioning him cheating and lying. I could understand that if we'd fought and never resolved anything but each time he reassured me everything is ok and we moved on. He CHOSE to lie to me for a month, straight to my face, even after id asked a couple times if he was hiding anything. That to me was the biggest betrayal. My splits are chaotic and hard to control, him lying for that long was a calculated decision 

In my mind, my BPD flair ups are symptoms that I've tried managing my whole life. I was upfront about all of it from the beginning and genuinely thought I did right by him that whole time despite my symptoms

After he said all of that I split again because I have nothing, no friends, no support, I tried my hardest to do right by him and it wasn't enough. He then took it all back saying he was calling me abusive out of anger

He's in a position of power in my mind. He has his mental facilities, he was friends, a job, emotional support. I have none of those things and here he is saying him lying to me is my fault

Is he DARVOing me? Am I the abuser? I can't for the life of me understand why he thought lying was a good idea if he actually respected me and didn't want me to break up with him. I've been around so many abusers and my intuitions going off constantly but I can't prove it

My alarm goes off at 6am. Mommy has Mia and I get up early so Mia can help her in the kitchen and I can wake up properly before school. Daddy is reading his newspaper in the kitchen. Today is the birthday of our Prince. Mommy fills up Daddy’s coffee and puts food on the table for us before grabbing Mia and going to the other table to eat their breakfast. 

I’ve asked Daddy why they aren’t allowed to eat with us, but he says that girls are to do things like eating out of sight so they don’t spoil our appetite. It doesn’t make sense to me, but Daddy said so and our teacher tells us that Daddies make all the rules. I finish breakfast and get up with Daddy to head to the front door. 

Mommy ties our shoes and puts on our coats before waving us out the door. I’ve asked Mommy to take me to school before but she always gives me this weird smile before telling me that only Daddy is allowed to drive and it’s too far to walk.

Daddy drops me off so I run inside and talk with my best friend before the bell rings. Every morning after the bell, we stand up to say the pledge of allegiance before starting our day:



*I pledge allegiance to the flag*

*Of the United Nation of Kings*

*And to the Monarchy for which it stands*

*One Kingdom under God, indivisible, with liberty and* 

*Justice for Men.*



Mommy cried the first time I said the pledge of allegiance in front of her, but Daddy said she was just being a silly woman. After we pledge, Mr. Smith teaches us about all kinds of things. He teaches us about how the world was divided and fought constantly before our king was elected to power in 2050. I still don’t understand what elect means, but that’s the word they always use. 

I raise my hand. 

“Yes Tom?” Mr. Smith says.

“Is it true that girls used to be in classes with us?” I ask. I know it’s silly but Mommy was telling Mia that she was smart and it wasn’t always like this. She says Mia should’ve been in school with me.

“That’s a silly question Tom. Please avoid asking silly questions in the future.” Mr. Smith says with a weird look on his face. The other boys laugh and I put my hand down. Mr. Smith doesn’t say anything else before moving on to talking about the royal guard. They’re so cool. I can’t wait to join when I’m old enough. 

The bell rings signaling the end of the school day and I run outside to get in the car with Daddy to go home. When we get there, a black car sits in the driveway. It has a crown on the side of the door. 

“Daddy, who’s car is that?” 

Daddy doesn’t respond but he has a worried look on his face. We get out of the car and go inside. Mommy’s hair is all messy and her face has a dark mark on it. She looks like that when she doesn’t listen to Daddy. She bows to us and takes off our coats and shoes. Daddy looks at her with an angry expression but doesn’t say anything.

We walk into the living room and see two royal guards sitting in our living room watching TV. 

“Daddy! Daddy! There’s two guards in our living room!” I shout excitedly and run over. “I want to be a guard too when I grow up!” One chuckles while the other gets down on my level and ruffles my hair just like Daddy does.

“You can do it kid. Stay in school and be good.” He says before rising to his full height. They’re so cool. “You too Mrs. Johnson. Be good. It’d be a shame if your son had to say goodbye to his Mom because he heard Mommy say silly things.” 

Mommy flinches and Daddy rolls his eyes. The other guard clears his throat. “I apologize for this visit Mr. Johnson. We got a report from Tommy’s school that your wife was spouting silly stories about girls being in school. We’ve already finished giving Mrs. Johnson a warning, but you might want to keep a closer eye on her.”

“I see. Thank you for your kindness regarding my wife. Please, join us for dinner.” The guards nod and I jump in excitement. 

“Mommy! You have to make sure dinner is extra yummy for the royal guards!” I yell before asking them as many questions as I possibly could. Mommy nods and walks to the kitchen with her head down, Mia following behind quietly.

The guards say goodbye after we eat and Daddy takes me to bed a few hours later. 

“Hey bud, I know Mom usually puts you to bed, but I just want you to know I’m proud of you. We have to make sure Mom and Mia know the rules okay? Let me know if you hear any other silly things.”

“I will Daddy. They were so cool. I can’t wait to be a guard when I grow up.” I yell before laying my head on the pillow, “Goodnight!”

“Goodnight, Son,” Daddy says before shutting the door. I hear Daddy discipline Mommy before the excitement wears off and I eventually fall asleep, dreaming about being a Guard when I’m grown up. I can’t wait.

I’ve been looking into some foldable sim rigs, but most people seem to say the same thing — they’re not very rigid and tend to move around a lot during corners. I also checked out the CoffeeRacer “Play” rig, but it looks like it might have the same issue.

My current idea is to mount the wheelbase on my desk using Moza’s clamps (since my desk seems sturdy enough even for an R9). For the pedals, I’m planning to build a platform out of 2.2 cm MDF boards: the front half would hold the pedals, and the back half would have a section where I can add weights to keep it stable (20-25 kilograms). I’d also stick some anti-slip rubber strips on the bottom to help it grip the floor.

But moments ago I did and alko says it has [50g per Liter sugar] https://share.google/SWoQ43LmQy4lDVnEQ) (this site is Rum Revelations that cites Alko). 

**Nose:** an intense fruity smell that I probably mischaracterized at that moment as pineapple and apricot when it most probably was banana ♤ caramel, a little chocolate and maybe a tiny bit of coffee (not sure)

**Taste:** It doesn't have intense fruity taste; slightly so but then I have no idea what taste it is. For a moment it reminded me of whiskey 🤷🏽‍♂️.

It is smooth.

#-----/-----

I feel like the power of this rum is 80% the smell and 20% the taste. It doesn't taste badly at all though.

The moment I drank it the concept of 'added sugar in rums' was absent. I think I thought something like 'is this what a sugarless rum *can* taste like? Humans made this sweet rum without added sugar? Is this possible?'. 

----/----

#Questions to the veteran tasters

**Question 1:** Are 50g per liter considered a lot of sugar? What amount is considered a lot of sugar?

**Question 2:** I don't know where to find this information, how did Bumbu achieve this fruity smell? Surely this isn't just sugar doing all this, innit?

**Question 3:** I saw another reddit post and reviews of this rum, calling it not rum. What should I expect in true rums, with minimal or no sugar? 

---/---

#Rating

I feel disappointed that this result isn't achieved without sugar or as some reviews said 'vanilla extracts' or something. **However,** I feel simple: do I like it? Yes, I enjoyed my experience. The rum is given a 8/10 *maybe,* by me. Would I drink it again? Not soon; I want to get multiple more rum xps. If you have multiple xps your rating is calibrated better imo.

He would come in everyday and we became pretty close, had such amazing banter and were really into each other and everyone around us saw that. I told him I was unavailable but he still pursued me heavily. Being with him was honestly the most fun I had had with someone in years and it was just so natural and comfortable but I had SO much going on, I was just completely emotionally unavailable. I told him if we had sex then it was just casual/having fun. Of course the sex was great. One night I acted immature and was talking about guys and he asked if I thought he was attracted to me when I did that and tbh I didn’t care because I was unavailable but he told me I was using him for sex and that hurt because I kind of was but I did really like him, I just couldn’t. 

I stayed with him and he took me to the airport and in the middle of my trip we had a huge argument over text and didn’t talk again. When I got back, he refused to talk to me but he still came to the coffee shop I worked at everyday, even though he moved to the other side of town. We didn’t talk and I moved on with the guilt/regret and not too long after he had a girlfriend. 

I lost my dog and my soul and left the country for 6 months. It had been almost a year since we saw each other or talked when I got back in town but I started working at a different coffee shop and one day he walks in. I freak out a little because I always felt bad for how things went and felt like there was so much left unsaid/unfinished. I thought he hated me but we locked eyes and smiled and said hey. He came over and we chatted for a bit and it was nice. We had that same banter as we did before but this guy is also just extremely outgoing and personable so it could be in my head. The next week him and his friend came in and we chatted some more. I mentioned I had a boyfriend (we had been dating a month and I didn’t want him to get the wrong idea) but I wonder if I hadn’t said that what would have happened. I look up and catch him staring at me and I smile and he smiles back but that was the last time I saw him. He hasn’t come back in since then and apparently he had been going there since I left. Idk if it’s a coincidence or what but I’ve been thinking about it the past couple months since first seeing him. We’re both single now and I can’t help but wonder. Am I supposed to let this go? Do I reach out? What if he rejects me? What do I even say? I’ve genuinely never regretted anything with a guy but this one I just can’t help but think about. What’s the lesson here if any?

1nz0cw2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nz0cw2,Trip Report: The Lanesborough London,"This was my second stay at The Lanesborough in the past year, and I thought I’d  share a review. I didn’t write one after my first visit, but my impressions this time were very much in line with that experience. Overall, this is a very strong property, and we had a very pleasant stay. 

**Arrival & Check-In**  
The welcome was warm and polished, with several porters greeting us at the curb to help with luggage. Check-in was smooth, and both of our rooms were ready well before the 3 PM check-in time.

**Rooms**  
For this stay, we had a Junior Suite and an Executive Junior Suite. Both rooms were spacious, functional, and extremely comfortable. My only gripe was that both bathrooms had single sinks, despite having enough space for doubles. The Executive Junior Suite had more windows and natural light, with a lovely view over Hyde Park, while the other overlooked The Peninsula. The rooms don’t appear to have been recently renovated, but they felt well maintained. Beds and linens were excellent, the AC/heating was quiet and efficient, and the water pressure was perfect. The rooms have been modernized a bit with tablet-controlled lights and blinds.

**Service**  
Service was consistently excellent. We found a sweet treat waiting in the room on arrival, and the fruit bowl was replenished each day. Staff across the board were warm and eager to please, but the butler team in particular stood out for their kindness. We joked about missing the days when turn-down chocolates were standard at hotels and that night we came back to find a lovely selection of chocolates.

The concierge team handled dinner reservations quickly and without issue. Housekeeping was flawless, with turndown always timed perfectly with our dinner plans. Perhaps most impressively, the team remembered all of our preferences from our last stay (even pre-setting the thermostat to our preferred temperature) with no reminders.

**Atmosphere**  
One of the biggest selling points here is how quiet the hotel feels. There’s some tourist traffic for afternoon tea, but otherwise, the property feels very low-key. That quietness carries into the rooms; despite being on busy Hyde Park Corner, we heard zero traffic noise. The doors are heavy and well-insulated, so you don’t hear neighbors or corridor noise either. Combined with blackout curtains, this meant we slept incredibly well.

  
The décor is classic English - not necessarily how I’d want my house decorated, but in London it feels just right. The breakfast venue is especially pretty, with a skylight that floods the space with natural light.

**The Weak Link**  
I am a sucker for a great hotel breakfast so I may be overly critical here, but breakfast was the one area that didn’t measure up. Booking through Virtuoso/Amex FHR includes a £45 credit per person per day. The “Lanesborough breakfast” is £46, which felt a little cheeky.

What bothered me was the nickel and diming. For example, I asked for toast with my scrambled eggs, and one slice of toast (cut in half) arrived for £5. Extra coffee or juice incurs additional charges. This felt out of step with a hotel of this caliber (and unlike my experience at its sister property, Le Bristol in Paris). In my experience, when you order a package breakfast you’ll get your juice topped up or another coffee. Not here.

We also had a few service hiccups. One morning, someone in our party ordered fried eggs well-done, but they arrived runny. The waiter noticed they weren’t eaten, we explained why, and he apologized - but the £20 charge stayed on the bill. Sparkling water was overpoured into three glasses and ran out before the fourth, so another bottle was opened. Both bottles showed up on the bill.

Small billing errors happened twice (wrong number of coffees/toasts charged). I flagged the issues, and they were corrected, but this shouldn’t be happening at a property of this standard. Breakfast itself was perfectly fine but not memorable which is a little disappointing for a bill approaching £250 for four people. 

One other quirk: the complimentary pressing service (three items per guest) is only available on the first day. It’s a lovely perk, and the work was beautifully done, but why limit it to the first day? After a long international flight, digging through my suitcase for clothes to press wasn’t exactly top of mind.

**Overall**  
Despite my gripes about breakfast, the overall experience was excellent. The staff is warm, the rooms comfortable, and the location is unbeatable. For us, those strengths outweigh the shortcomings, and we’ll happily return.",2,1759698906.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

The energy felt thick... too still... like multiple pairs of eyes followed me.

I work security - one man, one flashlight, one cracked thermos of coffee. Typical night shift survival kit. The place had been abandoned for years before some company bought it for storage. I'm not sure what they store, only that every box is sealed too neatly and stacked professionally. Feels like a front.

The first week was quiet. Cameras static, floors creaked, rats scratched inside the walls. Normal things. I'd whisper to myself just to break the silence. Sometimes I'd pop in some earbuds to change the atmosphere. Most times I would sleep or play on my phone.

It started with the windows of the office.

Windows line the hall outside the office - warped glass, silver faded to a dull gray. The kind you avoid looking into too long because it looks back. I'd catch glimpses when I passed... a womanly shape behind my shoulder... the faint glimpse of hair swaying when there was no logical explanation for any air flow in this building.

She never appeared fully. Just in reflections - glass, metal, water that pooled in the sink when I washed my hands. Every time I looked too fast, she was gone... every time I didn't, she was closer.

By the third week, I started talking to her. ""You just passing through?"" I'd ask the empty building between aisles of boxes. ""Or are you working the night shift too?""
My voice never sounded right anymore.

On the monitor screens, sometimes I saw movement - the shape of someone standing where no one should've been, facing the wall.
When I went to check, there was nothing but my own breathing and paranoia... and behind me, captured by the security footage. The woman. Pale. Watching. Waiting.

I started covering reflective surfaces - cardboard in front of glass, duct tape over metal, anything to stop the reflection. But you can't cover everything. Not the coffee in my cup, not the dark shine in my eyes when the light hit just right.

At 3:17 a.m., I caught her smiling at me from the black of a turned-off monitor. Her lips didn't move, but I heard her voice anyway - soft, patient, close.

""You work nights too, darling?""

I smashed the monitor with my flashlight. It didn't help. The cracked glass still showed her face - each shard holding a piece of her, like she'd multiplied.

By morning, the warehouse was quiet again. The boxes still stood like witnesses to my night.
They found my flashlight on the floor near the office...
and the security monitor flickering static.

Through the dark, you could almost see her silhouette, bending over my corpse - whispering something into ears that can't hear anymore.",1,1759698746.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

It’s a partnership between two people who care about each other, support each other, one of those couples who everyone looks at and says look at those lovebirds even when they’re in their 80’s ",0,1759698531.0,marriajo,2,0.5,False

[Jak TOHLE vůbec může být legální?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjaSwLWxZ9A) <-- LINK (translate) How can THIS even be legal?  
I got really carried away while writing my comment and instead of just sitting there, I would like to know your experiences, comments, tips, tricks and opinions.

I have been traveling to the Netherlands every year for work for 7 years. 3 years ago I came from Amsterdam to Prague. I was amazed at how many coffee shops there are in Prague and in the Czech Republic in general.. and I don't mean these souvenir shops, but weed shops, in Pilsen and with coffee like in Amsterdam. Considering that I smoked daily abroad, in Prague I was as exhausted as the first day after arriving in the Netherlands. Price from 200 to 300 per gram as in the Netherlands, you can also get stronger variants, hash and moonrock (which is extremely strong, not available abroad, often only one shop in the city has it for a limited time, here in the Czech Republic they had plenty of it in every other shop). Honestly, here in Czech coffeeshops, weed induces telepathy, harmony and synchronization (for many, paranoia, because the head cannot process it), which I experienced for about a minute at truffles in Amsterdam and then more times when I was sober with people who took angel dust. On classic weed, there is peace, silence, no thinking, laughter, ideas and talking, hunger, energy and fatigue. On weed from the Czech coffeeshop, there is the good feeling that I expect from it, but then noise in the head, telepathic voices, something like paranoia and fear, I can handle it easy, I control it, those who know about it are watching and talking about me, so it creates paranoia for the begginers or first time users. I meditated and was sober in the telepathic and magical circle for over half a year, I don't recommend it if you like your own non-magical reality, things can be learned, but I don't think I'll ever unlearn it and it really bothers me in life, especially when I notice that I've reconnected again unintentionally to the whole square or city, at one time they called me by my full name everywhere on the street for more than a month straight, but I know that crystal users can talk about it and don't have memory loss afterwards. Once when I climbed a tree and lit something from the Czech Coffeeshop, I connected and they were talking to me from two sides, some from the houses, others from the gardens, it bothered me, but I can't turn it off and then a guy called out to me from the gardens, ""(my name) and have you ever had gingerbread (methanphetamine)?""

When it started, they told me that it wasn't something to talk about, and by telling me, by talking about it, it changed my life, the structure of my brain, they confirmed something I didn't want to know, and I started talking about it, otherwise I would have ignored it and never developed it.",1,1759698294.0,Telepathy,1,1.0,False

1nyzzxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nyzzxj/behind_the_sliding_door/,Behind the Sliding Door,"The lake looked hungover most mornings—flat, gray, pretending not to remember wind. I’d stand on the deck with my coffee and try to convince myself the water’s calm meant ours was possible.

One month. That’s what we told June when we moved into her spare suite: thirty days, forty tops, until our place cleared inspection and we could stop living out of bins.

June joked about us squatting. “If my chairs go missing, I’m calling the news,” she said, laughing, not laughing. She had the kind of smile that pared a joke to the bone and left it on the counter, daring you to season it.

We’d been friends once—wine nights that turned into kitchen confessions, the sort of closeness that made me think agreeing to this arrangement was adult and generous rather than, as it turned out, naive.

The house sat on a sloped lot, glass facing the lake like a staged apology. Our “suite” was a former rec room with a sliding door to the main living area. From the start, the door was temperamental; by the third week, temper had become policy.

Evan tried optimism like a sweater that never quite fit. “It’s temporary,” he said. He stacked our bins neatly in the corner, labeled everything in blocky handwriting. He changed the batteries in the smoke detector and, unasked, put felt pads under the chairs so they wouldn’t scrape.

This is what he does: smooths edges, makes a case for patience.

June’s rules showed up one at a time. At first they were reasonable. No shoes on the rugs, wipe down the shower, don’t run the dryer after eleven because the lint trap screams.

Then they were precise. Label your food, use only the left half of the fridge deli drawer, a tidy list taped above the thermostat in Sharpie: DO NOT PASS 70° (ELECTRIC BILL!)

The list sprouted a cousin on the fridge—Household Safety Policy—with bullet points that sounded like a lawyer having a bad day. Tenants must announce entry to common areas. Tenants assume risk of injury. Landlord may restrict access to appliances in case of unsafe operation.

“Did you print this off a website?” I asked when I found it.

“Pinterest,” she said. “But it’s common sense.”

The Wi-Fi password changed first.

“Oh shoot,” June said when I asked. “Forgot to text you. New security. Tyler—” She stopped herself. “Old habit. Evan. I’ll write it down.”

She never did.

Evan shrugged and turned our phones into hotspots. “Two more weeks,” he said. “We can do almost anything for two more weeks.”

The TV upstairs developed a medical need for high volume. Even when she was outside, it blared softly into the bones of the house—commercial jingles you could hum through a pillow, a crime show that narrated itself right through drywall.

On days she left the TV on while she ran errands, I muted it with a remote I kept hidden in a drawer.

The next day I’d find the remote stuck to the underside of the coffee table with double-sided tape.

“I think she’s messing with us,” I told Evan.

“I think she’s particular,” he said. “Not malicious.”

He said the same thing about the sliding door the first night it locked.

We came home late, and the glass wouldn’t budge. June appeared in the dark kitchen, an outline with a phone light trained on our shoes.

“Sorry,” she said, too brightly. “Just checking the latch. Old doors like to drift.”

She was barefoot. The phone light drifted to my feet, then to Evan’s. “You’re back late.”

“Work ran long,” I said, though I didn’t owe her the detail and didn’t have it. “We’ll be quiet.”

“No worries,” she said. “The house carries sound.” She said it like a threat wrapped in a fun fact.

After that, the door began to stick more often. It clicked at odd hours.

Once, when I was in the shower, it slid open a fraction and then, slowly, closed.

“We have to leave,” I told Evan, half-wet on the bathmat. “Sooner than the inspection.”

“We will,” he said. “We can’t force the bank to move faster. For now, lock from our side. Let me talk to her about the door.”

He did. For a few days it behaved. The TV grew quieter. The fridge list stayed the same. I almost managed to convince myself I’d been dramatic.

Then the little things began to go.

A spare key we kept in a cereal box. A bowl I used in the mornings. A bottle opener, not special, just ours.

The key turned up on the windowsill with a note: Found this lol.

The bowl reappeared in the upstairs cabinet labeled PASTA BOWLS in June’s slanted hand, as if our possessions had been adopted and given better names.

The bottle opener I never saw again.

I started a journal. Times, dates, small facts. I wasn’t trying to build a case so much as I wanted to stop gaslighting myself.

Door locked at 9:12 p.m. TV loud at 6:40 a.m. Bowl reappeared upstairs 3:15 p.m.

Wi-Fi networks multiplied: LakeLife, LakeLifeGuest, LakeLifeKidsOnly, LakeLife!123 (5G).

June says “innsurance” with two n’s.

“Don’t do that,” Evan said when he saw me writing. “You’ll make yourself crazy.”

“I’m trying not to be crazy,” I said.

He pulled me to him and kissed my temple. “Two weeks,” he said again, like weather, like fact.

June began to invite Evan upstairs when I wasn’t around.

She needed help with a leaky faucet that didn’t leak when I checked it. She had questions about installing an outdoor camera. She wanted his opinion on paint colors.

When I came up behind them one afternoon, she was showing him screenshots of neighborhood alerts: Suspicious activity near the lake. Person with flashlight at 2:13 a.m.

The photos were blur and grain and reflection.

“We should be careful,” she said. She didn’t look at me. “I heard something the other night.”

“Footsteps?” I said.

“Could be,” she said, making a mouth like she was tasting a possibility. “Old houses carry sound.”

That night I woke to a sweep of light at the sliding door—slow, horizontal, like a search.

Evan was asleep, his breathing even.

I held my breath and watched the light pause, then tilt away, magician’s hand withdrawing.

In the morning, I found faint arcs on the deck like scuff marks. June’s boots, lined by the slider, matched the curve.

“Who would she be protecting us from,” I asked Evan, “if she were the one outside with a light?”

“Maybe she heard something and checked,” he said, but he didn’t quite make eye contact.

I moved the journal from my nightstand to the back of a kitchen drawer.

When I checked it three days later, the last entry was underlined in blue ink. I don’t own a blue pen.

I started leaving my phone recording on the counter when I went to shower.

The first day, I caught a rustle and door squeak and a hum that could’ve been the fridge, the old house, or a person.

The second day, nothing.

The third, the file was gone.

On a Sunday, June posted a printed schedule on the fridge: Shared Kitchen Hours.

Our names were assigned time blocks. Ours were early morning and late evening. Her blocks were everything else.

“Is this a joke?” I asked. My voice came out thinner than I intended.

She took a beat to pretend she hadn’t heard the fight in it. “Boundaries,” she said cheerfully. “It’s healthier.”

“For who?” I said.

“It’s my house,” she said, sweet as a burn. “So we’ll start there.”

Evan tried to split the difference.

He put a small table in our suite and called it a kitchenette. He bought a plug-in hot plate.

“A few more days,” he said. “It’ll be funny later.”

I wanted it to be funny. I wanted to look back and laugh about meal slots and password safari.

But the house had started to feel like a personality test we were failing.

The glass reflected us back as thin versions.

The storm came on a Thursday.

The weather alert did the phone-banshee thing that makes you feel like the sky is a person calling your name.

June stood on the deck watching the lake bruise. “We may lose power,” she announced, as if she’d written the forecast. “Candles are upstairs. I’ll be locking the sliding door to make sure wind doesn’t rattle it off the track.”

“It locks from both sides,” I said.

She smiled with all her teeth. “Exactly.”

The wind arrived fast, dinner plates slamming cabs, trees bending their knees.

When the power went, the house exhaled, then felt suddenly very present—each wall a shoulder, each window an eye.

The TV died mid-sentence upstairs; the silence left a shape as loud as any sound.

Evan found our flashlights. One was dead. The other worked if you pinched it like a reluctant bug.

The sliding door took its chance and misbehaved. From our side, it wouldn’t slide. From upstairs, something tapped it twice, like knuckles.

I said nothing.

The first crash came from the kitchen. A pan, maybe, or the complaint of a cutlery drawer yanked wide.

Then June’s voice, high, the way people sound when they want to be both frightened and in charge of the fright.

“Hello?” she called into the dark. “Is someone there?”

Evan put his hand on the doorjamb and listened hard. “Stay,” he said, meaning me.

He lifted the latch; it didn’t budge. “June?” he called. “You okay?”

Footsteps. Then light—June’s flashlight beam steady as a plan, cutting through the door’s seam.

“I saw someone at the window,” she said, a little breathless. “They ran.”

“Which window?” I asked.

“The one by your—” She stopped. “By the downstairs hallway.”

“There’s no window there,” I said.

The light bobbed. “I mean— I thought—” She laughed, a sharp thing. “Sorry. Storm brain.”

Evan went up the back stairs to check the locks.

I stayed in our suite and used my phone’s weak flashlight to scan the floor, under the futon, the corners where a shadow could decide to be more.

The room had become a different country.

The bins looked like strangers, the labels too sure of themselves.

In the beam’s edge, something caught. A small square tucked into the L between couch and wall.

I reached down and pulled it free. A phone. Not ours. Not new. Recording app open. Timestamp: 00:02:13.

My scalp prickled. I felt the urge to put it back exactly, pretend I had never touched what was touching me.

Instead I opened the audio.

Silence at first. Then the scrape of the sliding door, a small laugh I knew and didn’t want to know, Evan’s name in June’s whisper like a coin slid across a bar.

The recording stopped, started, stopped, as if the phone had been palmed and pocketed and set again.

Footsteps above me, then on the stairs, then outside our door.

I put the phone under the couch cushion and stepped back.

The sliding door slid, slow as a breath through teeth.

Evan’s silhouette, then June’s behind him like a shadow that didn’t belong to anything.

“Everything’s locked,” Evan said. He looked pale in the flashlight glow. “But the deck gate is open.”

“I told you,” June said. “Someone’s prowling.”

“Or you opened it,” I said.

I had meant for it to sound calm, clean. The words came out raw.

Her face went still. “Why would I do that?”

“Maybe because you like controlling what everyone’s afraid of,” I said. “Maybe because you’re bored. Maybe because you’re sick.”

It was too much. It sounded crazy. I heard it. Evan flinched.

“You know what?” June said softly. “I was going to be nice. I was going to say, let’s revisit the timeline in the morning. But I’m done. You need to leave. Now.”

“In a storm?” Evan asked. “Be reasonable.”

Her laugh was a knife. “I’m being reasonable. You,” she told me without looking at me, “are unstable. You’ve been recording me. You’ve been moving things and blaming me. You’ve been—” She gestured at the air, harvesting words. “Escalating.”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to drag the phone from under the cushion and play it, make truth do its job.

Instead I heard myself say, too quiet, “You’ve been in our room.”

Evan’s head snapped.

June’s smile skittered. “Why would I want to be in here?” she said, making here sound like an illness.

“Because you want to watch,” I said. “Because you can’t stand that we live a life inside your house that isn’t about you.”

Lightning whitened the glass.

For a second, all three of us were cutouts on a lightbox.

Then the world went black again, small and human.

From upstairs, a bang. Front door? Cabinet? The house shook its shoulders.

Evan motioned toward the stairs. “I’ll check the front,” he said. “Don’t—”

He didn’t finish. He looked at me like I was a problem with two true answers.

He went.

June stayed, her flashlight low, painting the floor.

“You should pack,” she said. “I won’t have this in my home.”

“I’ll pack,” I said. “And I’ll leave you a note.”

I made a smile that felt borrowed. “A friendly one.”

Her light stuttered across the couch cushion. I willed it to move on. It did.

“I’m calling the police,” she said. “A prowler is one thing. A tenant who threatens me is another.”

“Who threatened you?”

“You did,” she said, too evenly. “Just now. You said you’d leave a note.”

She blinked. “I don’t know what you mean when you say friendly.”

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. “Of course you don’t.”

Upstairs, Evan called for me. “Front door’s fine. But—”

He stopped. “There’s water by the back window.”

I took my chance. “Go help him,” I said to June. “I’ll start packing.”

She looked at me too long, calculating new math.

Then she went, a soft sweep of socks on stairs.

I pulled the phone from under the cushion and slipped it in my pocket.

My hands shook.

In the dim, I rolled one bin forward and stacked two others on top.

Pack what you can, I thought. Documents, chargers, the few clothes that still felt like mine.

I found our spare car key in the cereal box where it had reappeared.

I found a note on the inside flap of our bin labeled WINTER: This is not your house.

I left it there.

The storm got bored of rage and settled into purpose.

The house breathed with it.

I could hear June’s voice upstairs, fast and controlled, the register people use when they’re speaking for a recording.

For a second I wondered if she’d put a phone somewhere to catch us again.

For a second I wondered if she’d been catching us all along.

When the police lights finally lit the curve of the driveway, they turned the lake into an emergency.

June’s relief was theatrical. “Officer,” she called in a tone minted for sympathy, “thank goodness. There’s been someone trying to get in. And my tenants are—”

She looked directly at me through the sliding door glass. “Frightened.”

Evan stood half a step behind her, the expression of a man learning to count in a new language.

The officer took statements the way people take coats—politely, without promise.

June’s was crisp.

Evan’s was careful.

Mine was brief.

I didn’t mention the phone.

“Storms do weird things to houses,” the officer said finally, eyes on June’s boots by the slider, the wet arcs outside. “Locks swell, doors stick, branches knock.”

He looked at us like he wanted to be anywhere else. “You all be careful.”

After they left, June found her composure and a hair tie. “Morning,” she said, as if the night had been a temp.

“What did you tell them?” I asked.

“The truth,” she said. “That there were noises. That you’re leaving.”

Evan blinked. “We didn’t agree to that.”

“Yes, you did,” she said sweetly. “Just now.”

He looked at me. I looked at him.

We didn’t say what we were both thinking: that sometimes the reasonable thing is leaving before reason gets carved down to a rule on the fridge.

We packed.

Not everything. The bins that mattered. The rest of our life could catch up or grow mold.

Evan carried the heavier ones, moving like a person inventing a different future with each lift.

I took pictures of the rooms as if I were making a record for a judge who would never read it.

June stood on the deck and watched, her arms folded, the lake polishing its face behind her.

At the door, I put a note on the counter out of spite and habit both.

June—thank you for the time here. We’re moving out today. Text to coordinate returning keys.

I underlined coordinate twice and felt better than I should have.

When we left, she didn’t wave.

The storm had rinsed the air so clean it made my teeth ache.

Evan’s truck felt like an answer.

We drove to a motel with a number in the name and a smell of other people’s plans.

Evan fell asleep hard, his jaw unclenching in stages.

I sat at the end of the bed with the other phone in my hand and thought about

[https://imgur.com/a/ZLoIQVZ](https://imgur.com/a/ZLoIQVZ) <- the extraction site with my shoddy cellphone.  
  
Non-smoker (quit 5+ years), had a lot of restoration done over the past few weeks (several root canals, 16+ cavities) after finally getting dental coverage. Currently taking 500mg Amoxicillin x3 daily, high blood pressure but under control. This was the only tooth that was not able to be saved as it had broken too badly. The extraction was performed 5-6 days ago. I was also prescribed ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain, though I've only found myself needing to take it the day I came home and the freezing was wearing off and the past two days at night for unrelated dental pain. (It's on the opposite side of my mouth and putting pressure on that tooth makes it worse so I have to make an assumption- I have a check up next month for it regardless.) I do get occasional pain flare from the extraction site but it's extremely mild. Maybe a low 1 that spikes to a 2-3? It's noticeable but doesn't cause me anything more than momentary distraction? (But I also live with chronic pain that defaults at a 3 and spikes to 7-8 on bad days)

I have been drinking Ensure and water mostly. I've been having ONE lukewarm coffee a day. Also been eating oatmeal, jello, mashed potato and tomato soup, all of which have been cold, or lukewarm. I've been brushing daily without toothpaste and simply avoiding the top side with the extraction. 

I can try to take more photos if need be! Thank you in advanced and I appreciate all the dentists who help.

1nyzye3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1nyzye3/zeemo_ai_review_the_caption_whisperer_for/,Zeemo AI Review 🎬 The Caption Whisperer for Camera-Shy Creators?,"# 🎯 Product Overview

**Product Name:** [**Zeemo AI**](https://zeemo.ai/?via=ecoweb)  
**Category:** AI Tools → Video Creation Software  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

Let’s be honest. Editing captions can break your spirit faster than a coffee shop playlist stuck on lo-fi beats. For creators who live on Reels, Shorts, or TikTok, it’s a full-time gig just keeping text in sync. That’s where **Zeemo AI** swoops in - an **AI faceless video maker** that writes, translates, and formats captions so you can finally leave your keyboard alone for five minutes.

It’s an all-in-one **AI video editor for social media**, perfect for anyone who wants videos that look sharp without spending their entire weekend tweaking subtitles. It even helps you **create videos without showing your face**, so you can keep your hoodie on and still look professional.

# ⚙️ Feature Breakdown & First Impressions

Zeemo acts like that overachieving friend who brings snacks, plans the road trip, and still manages to finish early. The **automatic subtitle generator for videos** handles transcriptions in multiple languages, and the **AI video captioning software** keeps everything timed beautifully.

You can tweak fonts, drop in emojis, or toss in a sticker if you’re feeling fancy. It includes tools to **add subtitles to videos automatically** and export your work in clean formats like SRT or MP4. It feels less like editing and more like letting a very organized assistant handle the boring bits.

Even Ethan, my friend who edits videos in cafés for clients, admitted Zeemo [made his workflow smoother](https://zeemo.ai/?via=ecoweb). And this is a man who argues about font spacing for sport.

# 📊 Performance & Accuracy

Let’s talk results. The **Zeemo caption accuracy** claim of 98% isn’t a pipe dream. It handles crisp audio beautifully, though thick accents can still trip it up. Ethan tested it with his podcast material and only had to tweak a few words here and there.

The **AI video translation tool** does an admirable job too, swapping between languages like a polite multilingual robot. When compared in a **Zeemo vs CapCut comparison**, Zeemo syncs captions tighter and renders faster. It’s ideal for creators who can’t afford a missed word or sloppy timing.

Batch editing? Smooth. It processed multiple short clips without drama. Exporting in 4K takes a moment longer, but patience is a virtue… or so they say.

# 🧭 Ease of Use & Workflow

The interface is clean, easy, and doesn’t require a crash course to operate. The **AI video editor for social media** nails the basics: trim, crop, and format with precision.

Editing captions? A breeze. Click the line, fix it, done. That’s it. No labyrinth of settings or mystery icons. For people managing high-volume content, the **auto captions for TikTok and Reels** save serious time and sanity.

It even connects with the **text-to-video generator online**, letting you turn a script into a full clip faster than you can say “algorithm boost.” In many ways, it functions as subtle **video marketing automation using AI**, shaving hours off tedious editing loops while keeping creative control squarely in your hands.

# 🎭 Faceless Video Creation

Here’s where Zeemo earns its bragging rights. The **AI faceless video generator** lets you stay off-camera while still looking professional. It’s perfect for creators who’d rather avoid the awkward lighting setup or explaining why their “studio” is a kitchen counter.

Paired with the **AI video creator with subtitles**, it transforms plain text or narration into polished visuals. The **faceless video editing software** lets you mix voiceovers, captions, and even GIFs, making [content that feels fresh and personal](https://zeemo.ai/?via=ecoweb) without you ever hitting record.

If you like automating repetitive work, you’ll love this. Zeemo doubles as a quiet **AI caption and translation generator**, letting you repurpose content for global audiences without pulling an all-nighter.

# 👨‍💻 Ethan’s Personal Experience ...

My friend **Ethan Ramirez**, a freelance social media manager I sometimes collaborate with, spends half his life editing client videos in coffee shops with questionable Wi-Fi. He’s the kind of guy who can turn a dull product clip into something that actually trends, but he’s constantly drowning in captions, translations, and feedback loops.

When I mentioned **Zeemo AI**, he rolled his eyes - said he’d “seen every overhyped editing app on the internet.” But a week later, he texted me: *“Okay, this one’s legit.”* He used the **automatic subtitle generator for videos** on a fitness brand’s promo and finished in a third of the usual time. The **AI video creator with subtitles** handled English and Spanish captions without mixing them up, which was a first for him.

Ethan’s favorite part was the **AI faceless video maker** \- perfect for clients who don’t want to appear on camera. He churned out clips that looked polished enough for Instagram ads, complete with emojis and dynamic text. The only hiccups were a slight delay during export on one 4K project and one time it misheard “marketing funnel” as “mark eating funnel,” but honestly, that’s just free comedy.

“Annoying, not tragic,” he said while sipping a latte and uploading to Drive.

After that, he pretty much switched to Zeemo for all his short-form content work. In his words, it’s “the first AI tool that actually makes me faster instead of frustrated.” Honestly, coming from a guy who once ranted for twenty minutes about font alignment, that’s high praise.

# 💰 Pricing Options

Zeemo runs on a credit-based model that doesn’t require a spreadsheet to decode. You can start free (watermark included), then move to paid **Zeemo AI pricing plans** that scale with usage.

Pro users get longer uploads and [higher resolution](https://zeemo.ai/?via=ecoweb), while Business plans add batch uploads and team access. Credits power captioning, translations, and **AI faceless video generation**, so frequent creators should track them like caffeine intake.

For freelancers like Ethan, the Pro plan hits the sweet spot. Big teams might prefer the Business option to avoid bottlenecks. Overall, the pricing feels reasonable for an app that automates hours of tedious editing.

1nyzvmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rToronto_Clean/comments/1nyzvmf/38m4f_downtown_toronto_looking_to_date/,38M4F - Downtown Toronto - Looking to date intentionally,"Hello! I've been single for a couple of years after being in relationships since I was 29. I find online dating to be frustrating currently, because they give you so little space to really describe yourself! A handful of pictures, maybe a few short blurbs about your hobbies (or a few sentences), and that's it. So, after stumbling on this subreddit, I thought I'd give something different a shot.

I'm white, 38, 5'11 and 175lbs with brown hair and a beard. I wear glasses and I'm practically blind without them. I live and work downtown. My current job involves a bit of travel, but nothing excessive, and overall I now have an amazing work-life balance with low stress. 

I've got a variety of hobbies. I'm a fan of soccer, in particular EPL, and try to watch at least one game a week (time permitting). I love to travel, but I'm not really an all-inclusive / beach person. I much prefer actively visiting historical sites, museums, food tours, nature preserves, etc. I'm fond of camping and hiking, in either the early spring or late summer/fall (the bugs eat me alive if I go anywhere in Ontario in the summer). I'm a fan of the arts, in particular live theatre (Fringe festival is my favourite time of year in Toronto), live music (mostly metal and classical), and live comedy (improv more than standup). I enjoy going to the ROM and AGO, and smaller museums. I'm a foodie and I'm always down to try new restaurants (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are my favourites).

For quieter hobbies, I'm into tabletop and board games, and video games. I follow a number of different podcasts, like OSPod, Sounds like a Cult, and Moviestruck. I'm a voracious reader; mostly science fiction, fantasy, and history, although I will dabble in other genres when something appeals to me. I will watch a variety of TV shows, although I'm not really a fan of reality TV. Movies I'm down for pretty much anything, although my favourites by far are Horror and Action (especially older martial arts films).

My friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, considerate, and contemplative. I'm quiet, but not because I'm shy, rather because I prefer to listen. I think things through before I respond. But on the right topic I will absolutely talk your ear off.

If you've made it this far, you're wondering what am I looking for? A long term partner, but not keen to rush things. I'd rather spend quality time together through our shared hobbies and interests, and learning about what you enjoy in the hobbies and interests we don't share! We can chat for a bit on here, and then grab a coffee or tea in person and see where things go. ",1,1759697793.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

Few days ago I cought him looking at me in common area at work and, as he in generally very indecisive and totally fearfull avoidant, I decided to reach out yesterday with very grounded message saying that I feel its stupid to let go of what we had without even giving us another chance. I mentioned that he doesnt need to feel pressured to answer. He reached out immediatelly and we went for a coffee out next morning. It was 2 hours of fun and joking until I asked whether there is any chance of us getting back together. Then he circled around the subject (he is constanly so indecisive, like the breakup 3 weeks ago took 6 hours - he couldn't let go yet let go in the end...) but in the end concluded he wants only the friendship. He said he thought a lot about asking me out for coffee the last 3 weeks, but didn't reach out as he felt it would be unfair towards me as he wants only friendship and I want more... this is real hard for me to understand as he is obviously physically attracted to me and our personalities and humour match perfectly and we functioned wonderfully together and I was his only confidante in the last year (first as a friend, then as a partner for 2 months)... but anyway, he looks horrible, huge undereye circles, chainsmokes, got himself crazy busy with work and claims he cannot give me what I deserve... we hugged after coffee...I will try to look at this breakup as permanent and will try not contact him again, but do wonder, do you think if I waited longer he might have been more open to trying again? And is breaking no contact once (as I did now) and getting refused, sign of finality? I know I have to move on, but we had something so good, its hard to believe its permanently over...what are your experiences in similar situations, what are some signs of total finality?

Also, its a bit weird situation, but I always go with my family to all the theatre plays in my city. Its our tradition for years. I really wanna watch new play thats gonna be out next week, but he has a small role in it... is it weird to go and watch the play? I always watched all the plays that came out, I would be sorry not to see this one but don't know if its ok to go... I don't wanna look desparate.

And the last question - when we broke up 3 weeks ago, I asked him if its still ok to send some of my poems that were inspired by our relationship to editor. He said sure, that's it ok. I didn't expect poems to get accepted so quickly and they will probably be published (online magasine) in the next 3 weeks... how desparate does it looks?

1nyzow6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyzow6,I built an AI that does pro model photoshoots in seconds (100x cheaper!) – sharing what I learned.....,"So I've been working last few months on something crazy called [BroadwayCrown](http://broadwaycrown.com), it’s basically an **AI platform that creates professional model photoshoots in seconds** — no cameras, no photographers, no studio.

Why? Because real photoshoots are insanely expensive.  
Like….

* A decent photoshoot for a brand or a model costs anywhere from **$800 to $5000+**,
* Editing adds another **$200–$500**,
* And you still wait **2–7 days** for results.

Meanwhile, AI can generate hundreds of styled, studio-quality shots in **under 60 seconds**.  
At BroadwayCrown, we’re literally doing it at **100x lower cost** (yep, you can get 100+ photos for the price of a coffee ).

But what’s wild is seeing how people use it :

* Fashion startups are using it to **prototype entire product shoots** before even making samples.
* Influencers use it to **create brand collabs** without flying anywhere.
* E-com stores say it **tripled their content output** with same budget.

It kinda feels like how Canva changed design or how ChatGPT changed writing : but now for photography.

We’re just starting out, but I genuinely think **AI photoshoots will replace 80% of traditional shoots** in next 3–5 years.  
If you’ve ever struggled with getting good visuals for your brand, product, or yourself, check it out.

1nyzov5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/1nyzov5/a_conversation_id_have_over_coffee/,A Conversation I'd Have Over Coffee,"
I'm 61 now. Did my postgrad at MIT, spent a career in applied mathematics. But before we talk about equations and theory, you should know: 

I believe in this imperfect system we've got. 

Not blindly. Carefully.

I served. I put my life on the line for something bigger than yourself.

So let me tell you a story about ""We the People"" - and why those three words matter more than most twenty-year-olds realize yet.

The Summer of 1787

Picture this: It's brutally hot in Philadelphia. Fifty-five men, windows closed for secrecy, arguing for months about how to build a country.

They'd just fought a war against a king. They could have made Washington a king - he had the army's loyalty, the people's love. He could have taken it.

He didn't.

Instead, these men - brilliant, flawed, some of them slaveholders - sat in that room and asked a question no one had really answered before:

How do you build a government that rules by consent but doesn't collapse into chaos or tyranny?

They'd seen pure democracy in ancient Athens - it lasted less than 200 years and executed Socrates for asking questions.

They'd seen the Roman Republic - it became an empire when strongmen promised security and the people traded freedom for stability.

They knew history. And history kept saying: 
This doesn't work. People are too easily manipulated. Elites are too easily corrupted. It always fails.

But they tried anyway.



What They Actually Built

Here's what most people miss:

The Founders didn't trust anyone. Including themselves

Read Madison's Federalist 51. He's basically saying: ""People are ambitious and will seek power. So we're going to make ambition fight ambition. Make the branches of government compete with each other instead of ganging up on the citizens.""

 brilliant and cynical at the same time.

They built:
- A Senate that moves slowly (cooling saucer for the hot tea of the House)
- An electoral college because they didn't fully trust popular vote (elitist? Yes. But also pragmatic given 1787 communication)
- A Supreme Court insulated from elections (because justice shouldn't depend on popularity)
- A Bill of Rights added immediately (because even they realized they'd forgotten to protect individual freedom)

Every single structural ""flaw"" young people complain about? 

It was intentional.

Not because the Founders were geniuses. Because they were terrified of what they were building failing

Shit I’d be too 


Why I'm Telling You This

You're twenty. You see the system clearly:

The electoral college means someone can win the presidency while losing the popular vote. That feels wrong.

The Senate means Wyoming has the same power as California. That feels wrong.

Money influences politics. Corporations have too much power. The two-party system feels like no real choice.

You're not wrong about any of that

But here's what took me forty years to understand:

Fast change in government is how you get tyranny.

I've watched enough history - lived through enough of it - to see the pattern. 

Every time a country says ""we need to move quickly, the emergency is too urgent, we can't wait for process"" - that's when freedom dies.

Left or right. Doesn't matter. The mechanism is always the same:

Someone says: ""Trust me. Give me power. I'll fix it.""

And millions of people, frustrated with gridlock and delay, say: ""Yes. Please. Just make it work.""

And then it's too late.


What ""We the People"" Really Means

I spent my career in mathematics. I love elegant solutions. 

Clean answers. 

Efficient systems.

Government isn't math.

It's messy. It's slow. It's inefficient by design.

Because the alternative - centralized, efficient power that can act quickly - is how you get kings. Or dictators. Or democratic tyranny where 51% vote to oppress 49%.

""We the People"" doesn't mean ""whatever the majority wants right now.""

It means: 

The people, collectively, over time, through argument and persuasion and compromise, shape the nation.

The system says: ""You want change? 

Convince your neighbors. Build a coalition. 

Show it's not just your anger but your principle. 

Show it works not just for you but for people who disagree with you.


That's hard. It's supposed to be hard.

A Story From My Life

In my twenties, I was convinced I knew how things should work. The world was broken, and if people would just *listen* to reason, we could fix it.

At forty, I realized most people had the same certainty I did - they just disagreed on what ""reason"" meant.

At sixty, I realized the gift of this system:

It forces us to talk to each other.

Not to agree. Not to compromise our principles.

But to recognize that the person across from you - who thinks you're completely wrong - also loves their family, fears for their future, and wants the country to work.

The system doesn't let you win by force. You have to win by persuasion.

And when you can't persuade enough people? 

The system says: ""Not yet. Keep trying. Or accept that maybe you're wrong. Or that timing matters.""

That's infuriating when you're twenty and you *know* you're right.

It's wisdom when you're sixty and you've been wrong enough times to be humble.


Why You Serving Matters

I took an oath. Not to a president. Not to a party. 

To the Constitution.

That document - written by imperfect men in an imperfect time - created a framework that's survived a civil war, two world wars, depressions, scandals, and crises that would have toppled most governments.

Why

Because it's not about who's in power. 

It's about the system being bigger than any individual.

I defended that. I put my life on the line for a piece of paper that says: 

Government serves at the consent of the governed. And if it forgets that, we can change it - through votes, through amendments, through the slow, grinding work of democracy 



Most of human history is tyranny. Kings, emperors, strongmen, juntas.

We've got something different. 

Imperfect, frustrating, maddeningly slow.

But it's our


 We the People


What I'd Tell That Twenty-Year-Old

You're right to be frustrated. The system has real problems. Money in politics. Gerrymandering. Voter suppression. Corporate influence.

Fight those things. Please

But don't throw out the framework thinking you'll build something better from scratch.

Every generation thinks it invented moral clarity. Every generation thinks the old ways are broken and they've found the answer.

The Founders knew better. 

They knew they didn't have all the answers. 

So they built a system that could evolve, adapt, self-correct.

Slowly. Deliberately. With protections for people who lose today's vote.

Because they understood something that takes decades to fully appreciate:

The tyranny of the majority is still tyranny

And concentrated power, no matter how well-intentioned, always corrupts.

So yeah, the system is frustrating. It's supposed to be.

Because the alternative - quick, efficient, centralized power - that's how you get atrocities.

‘We the People' means you have a voice. You have a vote. You have rights the majority can't vote away.

Use them. Fight for what you believe. But respect the framework that lets you fight without bloodshed

That's the gift. That's what's worth defending.

Not because it's perfect.

Because it's designed to survive our imperfections.

""Does that make sense?"" I ask.

Because at sixty-one, I've learned: certainty is for the young. 

Humility is for those who've lived long enough to be wrong.

The system isn't perfect. It's just better than the alternatives we've tried.

And that's enough.",2,1759697361.0,PoliticalOpinions,3,1.0,False

So me (41M) and my ex (41F) ended things back in January, but we still live together for the rent and cause we have 4 kids together. 

She has issues with diabetes and back in January had to have surgery resulting in missing parts of her foot. She can not walk, but she tried anyway and broke her leg soon after in March. Currently she is unable to get up on her own. I was a home health aide and worked in nursing homes for years. So when she had the choice to come home or go to long term care she made it very clear she would hurt herself if she didn't come home. I told her I'd do everything I could to help, I just asked they she at least would let me put her to bed at a normal time as I drive the kids because of distance with the bus. She will still want to sit up till around 1Am. 

Yesterday I had 3 of the 4 kids working their weekend jobs. My oldest works at a theater and got off at 1030, the other got off at 9 and the other at 7. So around the end of the night after making 2 separate dinners (1 for her and the other for the kids) and running around and doing all that I had done after being up since 5 am the morning before, I was wore out, while she had been sleeping through the day. I wanted to lay down. She didn't. And because I'm the sole caregiver I can't lay down till she does. So finally about 1:30 she uses the restroom, and about 2:30 goes to bed and so do I. Then around 4 she calls me to use the restroom again, and then stays up till about 530 after that. 

I lay down again and at 8 she calls me to tell me she ordered the ingredients to make chorizo burritos. I am already running on a few hours sleep, and now I felt like things we talked about didn't matter to her, because I am autistic and they say it contributes to the feelings of being overwhelmed by people throwing things at you, so we have had many discussions about planning things for me to do without including me in the planning. So I automatically felt overwhelmed, and then I begin cooking, and I have some sensory issues and eggs make me nauseous, so once they begin cooking I get sick feeling and because I currently have a kidney stone it kicks into overdrive. I notice the pan handle is lose so I go to grab a screwdriver to fix it and get some air. 

As soon as I walk out she asks what I'm doing, I tell her the pan is lose and I'm fixing it. She said which pan, I said the one in using. She said which one is it. I said the biggest one. She said why are you rushing, I said cause I'm cooking. She asked is it the one with the lid... 

This is where I snapped. I just turned to her and said ""What does it matter I am cooking right now and I don't want to burn everything. You spring this on me the second I wake up, and I'm running on two hours sleep, why does it matter what pan I'm fixing, in literally just making food for you to eat""

She then begins to kinda pout and tell me when I'm done I still have to go to McDonald's and get her coffee. After I make her food I tried to talk to her. I told her I'm sorry for reacting, I just felt like we had this conversation 3 days ago about springing stuff on me and then when I'm already stressed you just focused on this pan for absolutely no reason and I got overwhelmed and I didn't handle it well, and I will work to make sure I recognize issues in the future."" She just said I was an Asshole.

I started Vyvanse 10 days ago for binge eating disorder.  The first few days I took it, I felt great.  No food noise, no appetite but not repulsed by food, great energy and concentration.  By about day 5, I started feeling terrible.  I feel like I can't sit still, can't focus on anything, I'm extremely fatigued and feel dull and numbed.  Even though I'm on this for BED, I've been sure to track my calories to be sure I'm getting enough food, as I don't want to crash and burn since I could really just go all day without eating anything substantial.  I've made sure to take it with a high protein meal. I'm staying hydrated. I've cut my coffee from three cups per day to one cup only.  The air hunger seems to be the thing that is bothering me the most.  Just trying to constantly get a deep breath and not being able to wears me out.  Has anyone else experienced this?  If so, how  do you combat it?  I've not taken any kind of stimulant, medicinally or recreationally, other than caffeine since the early 2000s.  Maybe it will just take some time?  

I really enjoy the appetite suppressing effects, because I've been struggling badly with food noise and constant snacking and bingeing for quite some time and it's nice to feel normal in that regard.  But I'm just so...sad. And tired. ",4,1759697188.0,VyvanseADHD,14,0.83,False

1nyzluf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nyzluf/aita_for_being_a_friend_without_benefits/,AITA for being a friend without benefits,"I had a friendship end recently. We initially met through a dating app, went out a couple of times, then I ended it expecting not to hear from her again. A couple of months later she reached out because I had a rental unit that had been empty when we went out. She doesn't drive and had found a job a long bus ride from her, but near me. The place had just been rented out, but I told her they could use my spare room (free) while she looked for a place. While she was staying with me we became really close friends, then started hooking up (mostly driven by them but I didn't take much convincing, for what that's worth). We were very clear with each other that neither of us was interested in a relationship.

She eventually found a place very close by, so they would just stop by for like an hour for coffee in the morning, or for dinner, things like that, and we would see each other all the time. We spent a lot of time together. We were both single and occasionally we'd sleep together, but that happened less and less frequently. Mostly we just had a normal friendship and she was one of my closest friends.

One time I invited her over for dinner and we were watching a movie after. She was on the couch and I was lying on the floor, i.e. we were not cuddling or anything like that at the time, although I was pretty cuddly with them generally. She asked me if we were going to have sex tonight and I said probably not. She immediately got up and walked out of the room, I went after her and asked if they were leaving, she gave me a hug, said yeah, and left.

When she got home she started texting me that I was just using her to boost my ego by leading them on, that I should have let her know when I stopped being interested in sex, and wanting to know why I didn't want to have sex anymore. I told her I didn't want to talk about this through texts, that the way they left made me feel used also, and that it's not necessarily about them, I just don't feel like having sex, and I didn't tell her because it's hard to notice when you're NOT feeling something. She pressed me to explain why I didn't want to have sex and I told her it's shitty to not just take ""I don't want to"" for an answer. She got mad at me for being offended. The argument lasted a long time (over text) but those are the main points we were making.

So that blew up our friendship. We hung out a couple of times after but it always degenerated into arguing - not about what had happened that night, but just about any/everything. Now we don't talk at all and I accept the relationship is over. This has me really messed up because I felt like our relationship had a lot more depth than that, but she wanted to drop it as soon as sex was off the table. Mutual friends told me she's FURIOUS at me months later. I don't understand why. Is it because ITA?",3,1759697161.0,AmItheAsshole,13,0.71,False

We got married in April after being in a long-distance relationship. We had a big wedding and enjoyed it. There had already been some issues in our relationship, but we tried to work through them. One major thing was that I moved to his city, which is six hours away from my hometown.

I decided to give life in his town a try, but I always said that I’d move back if I didn’t feel comfortable. At that time, I was still studying and also working. After the wedding, I focused only on my studies and told him I wouldn’t work until I finished, so I could adjust to the new city. For context, I used to live in a big city, and he lives in a small town. I was always worried about that change, but he promised to be my safe place.

After we got married, we visited my family a few times (for example, for my sister’s goodbye party and birthdays). Every time we visited, he would say he wanted to go home and didn’t feel comfortable. I tried to give him space, but he was always like that around my family.

We had some fights, and I started realizing that he didn’t trust me. For example, if I said I was sick, he wouldn’t believe me unless I had serious symptoms like coughing or vomiting. This happened more than once. I first thought maybe I wasn’t communicating clearly, but eventually realized he had trust issues.

Also, when I try to explain my feelings, he doesn’t really listen. He’ll just say “sorry” to shut me up — not because he actually means it.

Another issue was about a safe deposit box where we kept valuable wedding gifts. The safe is under his name, but I had a permit to access it. We kept the key in a shared hiding spot. One day I realized the spot wasn’t very secure, so I changed it and told him while he was at work. I didn’t think it was a big deal. Later, while I was visiting my family, he called me to ask where the key was. I told him, and I thought that was the end of it.

But when I came back, he told me he had removed my permit to access the safe because he thought I had intentionally hidden the keys from him. Even though I had told him right away where the key was, he still took the permit. That was a huge deal for me — it broke my trust. And he refused to give the permit back. (This will be important later.)

I told him we needed therapy because I couldn’t move forward with the trust issues and constant fighting. At first, he refused. After another fight, I was so fed up that I told him we should go to his parents and ask for advice. That was a big mistake. His parents just said, ""These kinds of things happen."" When I told them about the safe incident, they didn’t react at all — almost like they already knew.

Eventually, we decided to go to therapy. He didn’t like it but agreed to try. We had a few sessions, but I didn’t feel like he was really putting in the effort. Maybe he was trying — but very slowly.

Some time passed, and I tried talking to him about some intimacy issues — I wasn’t feeling close enough to want to be intimate with him. When I told him, he got mad, took off his wedding ring, put it on the nightstand, and said, “You're causing too many problems lately. You should go to your family.” Then he grabbed his pillow and went to sleep in the living room.

I was shocked. I cried, and a while later I went outside to get some air. While I was out, he sent me a bus ticket to go back to my hometown. I was furious. I went back inside and told him that this is my home too and he can't just kick me out. He had calmed down by then and said maybe everything was just because of our issues and that we would fix it.

I believed him and thought maybe it was just a one-time thing.

But two days later, we had another fight. I told him I didn’t feel safe without access to the safe and that, when my sister comes to visit, I’ll give her my valuable belongings to take home with her — because I no longer trusted him. That made him angry. Again, he told me to pack my things and leave. I reminded him that it was also my home. He smirked and said, “Pack or don’t pack — but you’re leaving today.”

I was hurt and angry. I called my sister and told her he kicked me out. He followed me and grabbed the phone, telling her that he never said that and didn’t mean it. I saw the fear in his eyes — not fear about hurting me, but fear about what my family would say or do. That made me even angrier. He wasn’t sorry; he was just scared of consequences.

My sister calmed us down and said she’d come visit the next day (she had already planned to). That evening, we talked for hours. He cried and I really thought he felt sorry.

The next day, my sister arrived and spoke to him. She wasn’t aggressive, just told him that everyone says things they don’t mean when they’re angry — but if he ever does it again, she’ll be furious.

Time passed. I had planned a solo vacation because he promised I could go on a girls’ trip and also visit family. The day before my flight, his dad asked to be picked up from the airport. I said I could do it. My husband took time off work to pick him up — even though I hadn’t asked him to. Later, plans changed and someone else picked his dad up.

That same day, while he was working(hoemoffice), I was in the living room planning for my trip. It was my last day before flying, and I hadn’t packed yet. He asked  me  to cook for his dad, since he was arriving. I said I couldn’t because I had no time. He insisted, saying, “It would look good — as a bride.” I said we could just order food, but I didn’t have the time to cook.

He got mad and whispered, “It’s my fault for choosing someone like you.”

I was angry but had things to do, so I left. Later that evening, I told him I didn’t appreciate what he said. He didn’t apologize and told me again, “Yeah, I picked the wrong girl.” He made a few more rude comments, and then — he said something truly disgusting, which translates to “I’ll shit in your mouth.” It’s extremely disrespectful in our culture. I was done. I went to sleep without saying more.

The next morning, he dropped me off at the train station so I could get to the airport — which is just an hour away. Keep in mind, he took the day off for his father, who was also coming from the airport, but wouldn’t drive *me* there — even though I was carrying three suitcases and a handbag.

**UPDATE** 

When I originally wrote my story, I never posted it. But now I finally have the courage to share it.

After everything that happened, I went on my solo vacation and told my family everything my husband had done. My mom and dad were shocked. My dad, who is usually a very quiet and calm man, actually got angry — which never happens. I told them I wanted them to be prepared to pick me up, because I had decided I was going to get a divorce.

I tried to enjoy the vacation and even went to Las Vegas. During that time, we barely talked. When we did, it usually ended in fights. Before I left, he gave me some money for the trip — but only after our therapist convinced him. At first, he didn’t want to give it to me because he was jealous that I was going on vacation without him. I told him I didn’t want the money because I knew he’d throw it back in my face later… and of course, that’s exactly what he did.

While I was still on vacation, during one phone call, he said he no longer wanted to continue therapy because “it’s too expensive.” I reminded him that we had only had a few sessions and that we still had a lot to work through. That’s when he said, “If I hadn’t given you money for your vacation, I could afford therapy.”

I told him again that I didn’t even want the money — he insisted on giving it to me. But now he was saying that since I don’t work and don’t have much money, he feels pressured to provide. I told him I would ask my family for help if I needed anything. His response?  
**“Okay, then tell your mom to pay me back the $1,000 I gave you. And if you want to continue therapy, you better get a job — I’m not paying for it anymore.”**

Just to clarify: he has a great-paying job. This wasn’t about money — it was about control and pettiness. He was angry that he was alone while I was away, even though he had agreed and even promised that I could go visit my family abroad.

A few other things happened, and by that point, I was mentally halfway out of the marriage.

When I came back from vacation, he picked me up at the airport, cleaned the house, and made some food. For a short moment, I felt happy. But just a few days later, I noticed that my plant — a gift I had received from my workplace — had died. I wasn’t upset that the plant died (I’m honestly bad with plants too), but I was hurt that he didn’t even tell me. Instead, he just used the plant pot for his own stuff.

I asked him why he hadn’t told me, and he said, “I didn’t know it was that important.” But I used to say good morning to that plant every day. I always told him how much I loved it. That moment made something click inside me — I realized that every time I told him something was important to me, he just didn’t care.

He never truly loved or appreciated me. It was like a stone hit my heart, and I broke down crying. That’s when I called my mom and said, **“I want a divorce.”**

The next day, I told him my mom and dad would be coming to pick me up. He cried and asked me to stay. We both cried, and I started questioning myself — wondering if I was doing the right thing. He said, “Give me two months, I’ll change,” and “Let’s go to therapy again, we can fix it.”

But this time, I stood firm.

My parents came to our home, and so did his parents. We all sat down and talked. My parents were calm — not angry, just disappointed. They didn’t want to cause a scene.

But oh boy… the drama started fast.

His mom went full dragon mode. She was furious. She started arguing with me about every private conversation I had ever had with her son — conversations I assumed stayed between husband and wife. That’s when I realized: **he had told his mom everything.**

Every little argument. Every fight. Every therapy session. She even brought up how he said therapy was too expensive — using it against me, word for word. She even knew things about my past — like that I had a boyfriend before my husband. She used that to shame me in front of my parents, as if I was some kind of ""bad woman.""

My mom stood up for me and set clear boundaries, but it didn’t stop his mother. She went on and on:  
**“You never cook for my son, you don’t clean, and you’re always playing on the PS5.”**

At that point, I just started laughing. None of that was true.

I tried to speak up and told her her son had kicked me out of our home *twice*. She dismissed it and said, “I can’t believe this story. You’re only telling your side — maybe you’re leaving parts out.”  
The irony? She was doing exactly that herself, just using *his* version of events.

Then, my husband got petty and forced me to sign a contract saying I no longer live in the flat and have no rights to it — otherwise, he wouldn’t give me access to my belongings in the safe.

I was furious, but I signed it just to get my things back.

That’s when I packed up everything I had bought — and yes, I made sure to take the **fancy coffee machine** my sister had gifted *us*. I don’t even drink coffee, but he does — and after the way his mom acted, I wasn’t going to leave anything nice behind. He can enjoy instant coffee from now on.

We packed everything we could and left.

At that moment, after all the lies, gaslighting, manipulation, and petty behavior — I just thought,  
**""I’m really, truly done with this.""**

Writing this all down is such a relief.

I still need to go back one more time to collect the rest of my things.

We called it “The Line.” No one stayed plump for too long once they joined the team. There were seventy two flights of stairs carved into the rock beneath the building. As far as I know, no one knew for sure who carved those stairs. Our team was a ragtag group of former criminals in witness protection, disgraced military, and actual researchers of the no-name, no social security number variety. They liked to joke about how they'd publicly died and which organizations came to them about faking their deaths. The range of diversity was mindblowing. I got there because, although I beat up a cop and lied to the Feds, I was a former doctoral student. I was a third striker, and staring down twenty to fifty.

Instead, I got the offer for a job in an underground lab. I can’t tell you where, but there’s a lot of fresh air out there, greenery as far as the eye can see, and expanses of violet mountains against a sky you look across. No buildings standing tall out there, no traffic. The town we’d commute to was big enough that not everyone knew one another, and small enough to keep an eye on us. No one wanted to be a problem though. The world already thought most of us were dead. It wouldn’t be a problem for anyone to make it so.

Our job? Well, we pulled The Line. We’d get met at the top of the stairs after entering the basement of what, from the outside, looked like a log cabin at the base of a mountainside, by our secretary, Beryl, with a cup of coffee, a water, and a donut. A nearby machine scanned the chip at the base of our necks. After we hiked down those stairs, another machine scanned our chip a second time logging us in for the day. That check-in was the clock in, and if you were late, you were late at that check-in, not the first one. From there, you got into your jumpsuit, your safety gear, covered your boots, put on your goggles, grabbed your headset and gloves, and got out to the floor. If you were lucky, Beryl made the coffee black and rough enough to hype you up. Sometimes, we pulled in some weird shit on The Line.

In reality, The Line was several lines. Ten to be exact. I worked on line seven most days, but occasionally I’d be put on the tenth line. Our teams were hierarchical, with the lowest number teams being the best and the highest number being the worst. The tenth team often needed extra help, so if seven through nine weren’t busy, we’d be moved to ten. I did like being on the seventh. We’d clawed our way from nine and had our eyes set on making top five at some point.

Every morning, we’d get to the floor and never know what to expect. The night team left messages on the board before we’d get checked in, and Beryl would give us the run-down. Sometimes, there was bad news, and she had to give us a weapon.

However, it was usually during the day when we pulled in some weird shit off the lines, ironically. Power Hours, the most dangerous time, tended to be between noon and two. On off-days, I paced my apartment at noon, sweating through my clothes, heart pounding. Sometimes, I locked myself in the closet. I promised myself if Beryl handed me a weapon again, I’d use it on myself. Fast. However, when my off days ended, I’d meet a handful of my teammates at the train station and ride over in silence with them, meet Beryl, go down those stairs, clock in, and do my work. Perhaps it was the power of being on a team.

And team we were. Unlike ten, who constantly argued and couldn’t find a rhythm, we’d strategize, focus and pull the line. Our workspace measured about two football fields back to back in a cavernous rocky expanse. The Line itself ran through a space two football fields wide and dimly lit by wall lamps that barely cut through the gloom. The air had a charge to it, like just before a lightning strike, and smelled of copper and scorched hair. When you looked up at the ceiling, it was hard to believe it was even there and that, somewhere above, was the cabin.

The floor was where the splits happened. Our line was on the far left, a glowing jagged beam that looked like a thicker laser beam, amount the thickness of a young tree that emerged from the darkness in front of us. On either side, with the teams between, sat huge pallets and shelves of objects we’d pulled off the line and catalogued. The Line looked like light and felt like what I'd guess was the texture of a vein. Heavy, elastic, and always humming in a frequency you felt in your teeth. When pulled properly, it bent reality, and objects tore loose from whatever places they came from.

Some were simple, a coin purse or a paper bag from a fast food place no one ever heard of. Some were quite huge, like the giant rocking horse a team had pulled off the line decades before or a huge mannequin painted to look like a clown sitting alongside what looked and was shaped like a dog’s collar, but big enough to wrap around a hippo’s neck. All of it wrapped in plastic, the only barrier between that stuff and us. High above, in a glass and metal box stood the researchers and, upon occasion, the team leaders of team one and two. It was hard to look up at the box. My belly roiled with envy each time I saw it. How nice it would’ve been to be up there, safe in that box. Safe away from it all.

When you placed your gloved hands on the line, you split. You didn’t speak to the other versions of yourself, you didn’t look at them. That was Rule One. They divided right behind you, and eventually, once it was time to pull, your team of ten or twelve guys grew to well over a hundred, each one of them pulling in objects from the universe he occupied. Machines couldn’t pull the line.

According to our bosses, sentience was key. Gripping it was difficult. Though it seemed made of light, there was a mass to it, and it was pliable like taffy glowing in your gloves. The goal wasn’t to pull it and stretch it, which was easy, the goal was to pull it and move it. When it moved, it pulled objects, and sometimes living creatures, free and stuck in its orbit. It was tricky to get the right grip and the right motion for best effectiveness. We’d learned that every man had to be of one accord, and every man had to follow the leader. If he was wrong, it was better than discord. And we pulled together, on rhythm, again and again. The guys at the back collected what came through, plucking it free with their forklifts.  I was rarely on forklift or cataloging, which didn’t bother me...",1,1759696844.0,CollaborativeStories,0,1.0,False

My daughter turned 3 in August and she just started using sentences last month. Her speech is very broken and she only talks to specific people. People have split opinions on her 50% of people think she's fine and I should let her progress at her own pace. 50% of people are looking at her in disbelief of how behind she is asking why she doesn't have a diagnosis yet. A woman at the library I know suggested me to watch a autistic child stating my daughter was on the spectrum I corrected her saying my daughter was not diagnosed with anything. Her response was basically I needed to wake up and smell the coffee. My daughter has been going to the library frequently for a year and has never said a single word to anyone there. I have people ask me on occasion if she can speak and she definitely can. We worked with speech specialist until about 2.5 and at the end they said she was low end of age level for everything except her pronunciation. Her pronunciation hasn't improved much since. She has full on conversations with me and I only understand 2-3 words. Her peers can't understand most of the time although she also doesn't try to talk to most of them she talks to me my grandma, my mom and her baby sitter and dad and that's it also her sister who is turning two in November already talks better than she does. Slowly I'm noticing other signs. She has rules for things like we ate her favorite snack for movie night a few times and now she only eats it on movie nights. Certain shows she'll only watch at night. She used to be terrified of dirt to the extent she wouldn't go down a slide unless I cleaned it off and she would cry if her hands got dirty, i spent a day playing in the dirt finding worms and showing her how dirt was made and it got better she still likes things clean and will get on me about cleaning up a mess if she finds one and won't stop hounding me until it's taken care of even if I'm in the middle of cooking or a important phone call. We have a huge issue with whining, she can tell me she needs help or ask for food or any other news she has but often she chooses to cry instead and then I have to spend a significant amount of time calming her before we move i can take care of the original issue. I asked her speech therapist her opinion if she thought she was on the spectrum but she honestly seemed clueless to me she said she liked people too much to be autistic. Me and her father are both level 1 autism and my sister is level 2 so I know it's a risk but everyone keeps telling me I'm nuts",0,1759696760.0,Autism_Parenting,1,0.33,False

Relaxing on a Sunday, I thought I'd ask Claude AI to ""roast my watch"". Enjoy.

Ah yes, the Sinn U50 – for when you need everyone at the office to know you're very serious about theoretical capabilities you'll never use. It's the watch equivalent of daily-driving a military Humvee to pick up groceries.

I love how it's roughly the same diameter as a dinner plate. And with that rotating bezel, you can precisely time... what exactly? How long it takes for people to stop asking ""is that comfortable on your wrist?""

And that light grey silicone strap – chef's kiss – really commits to the ""professional deep-sea diver who exclusively dives in bathtubs"" aesthetic. It's like you wanted everyone to know you're technically prepared for a submarine rescue mission, but you're actually just tracking how long until your next coffee break at the office.

500 meters of water resistance! Perfect for that time you might accidentally fall into the Mariana Trench on your commute. Though let's be honest, the deepest this watch has been is the bottom of your sock drawer when you realize you can't wear it with a dress shirt because it won't fit under the cuff.

1nyz5p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1nyz5p4/30day_experiment_cannabinoid_ratios_for_sleep/,30-day experiment: Cannabinoid ratios for sleep optimization - preliminary data,"Background: I've been tracking my sleep metrics religiously for about 2 years now (Oura ring + sleep diary). My deep sleep percentages have been consistently suboptimal (12-14% vs the ideal 20-25%), and I wake up 4-6 times per night. I've already optimized the usual suspects:

* Blackout curtains, room temp at 67°F, blue light blocking after 7pm
* Magnesium glycinate (400mg), L-theanine (200mg), glycine (3g) before bed
* No caffeine after 12pm, last meal 3+ hours before sleep
* Consistent sleep schedule (10:30pm-6:30am)

Despite all this, my sleep quality plateaued. HRV averages around 45ms, which is okay but not great for my age (32M).

The Experiment:

I decided to systematically test cannabinoid combinations to see if they could push my metrics into optimal range. I know the endocannabinoid system plays a role in sleep regulation, so I wanted to approach this scientifically rather than just randomly taking whatever.

Protocol:

* Week 1-2: CBD only (25mg, 1 hour before bed)
* Week 3-4: Low-dose THC only (5mg Delta 9, 1 hour before bed)
* Week 5-6: CBD + THC combination (20mg CBD + 5mg THC)
* Week 7-8: Adjusted ratio based on results

I sourced products from a few different brands for consistency because the lab reports were actually accessible and dosing seemed more reliable than some others I tried initially.

Preliminary Results (through Week 4):

*CBD only (25mg):*

* Deep sleep: 13-15% (minimal improvement)
* Wake episodes: 4-5 per night (slight improvement)
* Subjective quality: 6/10
* HRV: 47ms average (small increase)
* Side effects: None

*THC only (5mg Delta 9):*

* Deep sleep: 16-18% (notable improvement)
* Wake episodes: 2-3 per night (significant improvement)
* Subjective quality: 7.5/10
* HRV: 52ms average (good increase)
* Side effects: Slight grogginess first 2 days, then adapted

*CBD + THC combo (20mg + 5mg):*

* Deep sleep: 19-21% (excellent improvement)
* Wake episodes: 1-2 per night (major improvement)
* Subjective quality: 8.5/10
* HRV: 58ms average (significant increase)
* Side effects: None after adaptation period

Interesting observations:

1. The combination seems synergistic - better than either compound alone
2. Tolerance doesn't seem to be building (4 weeks in with the combo now)
3. No next-day cognitive impairment on any protocol (tested with dual n-back scores)
4. REM sleep actually increased slightly too (wasn't expecting that)
5. Resting heart rate dropped by 3-4 bpm on average

Questions for the community:

1. Has anyone else experimented systematically with cannabinoid ratios? What were your findings?
2. Should I try cycling on/off to prevent potential tolerance, or is daily use sustainable long-term?
3. Any concerns about downregulation of endogenous cannabinoid production with chronic use?
4. Would it be worth testing higher CBD ratios (like 40mg CBD + 5mg THC) to see if there's additional benefit?

I'm planning to continue for the full 8 weeks and will post complete data with graphs if there's interest. I know cannabinoids are controversial in optimization circles, but the objective data is pretty compelling so far.

Current stack for reference:

* AM: Coffee + L-theanine, Omega-3, Vitamin D3/K2, Creatine
* PM: Magnesium glycinate, Glycine, CBD/THC combo
* Training: 3x strength, 2x zone 2 cardio per week

1nyz3xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1nyz3xp/ive_been_having_recurring_dreams_with_the_same/,I’ve been having recurring dreams with the same setting—is there any meaning to this?,"My dreams have always been odd. Usually, that’s due to the content, but in this case, it’s due to the repetition of it. 

In the dream, I go through a “train station” that has select air travel services for a fee, where a few people (different every time) are piled on a small airplane and taken to the location. Every time, I go on the plane, which takes me to a town about an hour away (where I plan to go for my Bachelor’s degree, irl).

And every time, I go to this one particular coffee shop that has the same exact appearance every time, despite not existing, and order the same thing—a caramel croissant and a latte. 

From that point, the dream branches in some random direction. Several locations repeat across these branches, and have new things for me to do every time.

 I don’t think the events themselves have much of a meaning, but is this my subconscious just *really* wanting to go to that town? I’ve never had anything repeat like this before, and it’s happened enough to where I could probably draw these places from memory.",0,1759696012.0,Dreams,1,0.5,False

1nyz20u,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1nyz20u/mil_went_into_babys_room_at_night_without/,MIL went into baby’s room at night without permission,"My MIL and I have had difficulties in the past. She is the kind of person who will blow past boundaries and acceptable behavior for humans in general, cry about it when she’s called out, and play victim or the innocent idiot. Happens all the time. DH is her youngest (she has four children) and even before we were married both my future SILs warned me vehemently not to confide in MIL because she loves to get in between her children and their spouses. I love my FIL and StepMIL- this is important because I know all the family secrets at this point. MIL wanted divorce after cheating on FIL with multiple men, now she regrets it because she’s still single and misses out on events with grandkids/children because she can’t keep her mouth shut or hands to herself. She is a VERY touchy feely person which my husband has told her to avoid with me in the past. She has to put hands on you (and wink at you) if she’s telling you a story. It’s very weird and makes me uncomfortable.

I had a baby almost ten months ago, my first. 
We invited her to visit (she lives a few hundred miles away) a year ago before he was born. DH pushed it, said we needed to break the ice before the baby came after something she posted on FB in response to an article I wrote. (She reposted it, went over the top with praise, despite us not being close or talking really at all, my own mom wouldn’t do this). DH talked to her about the post and explained why that was weird and over the top, her feelings were hurt, she didn’t talk to DH for months after that. 

When baby was four months old we drove to her house for her to meet him. We CAMPED for three nights to get there. My anxiety was through the roof because I was bringing my baby to meet someone I don’t trust and have had issues with in the past, and baby had a ton of trouble sleeping. I wanted to cancel the trip and go home after the first night and suffer her coming to our home instead. DH lost it, said “my mom doesn’t deserve that”, spoke the word divorce for the first time ever to me, all while I was crying and trying to help my baby sleep. We continued on with the trip because he convinced me I was being overly sensitive and reactive. Building up this to be worse than it was. 
The visit was actually decent. She was on her best behavior because her visit last year to our home was horrible. She overstepped a lot of boundaries, tried to start a conversation with me bashing DH (“I don’t know how you live with him”). She tried telling us how to do things in our own house in the kitchen, commented on how our place wasn’t baby proofed (I was 7 months pregnant). 

Fast forward again to this weekend. I was optimistic. My mom is moving in with us soon so I was the one who brought up the fact we should have MIL down before that so she doesn’t have to pay for a hotel. She gets here, first evening is fine. My baby has some stranger danger so she didn’t push holding him or getting too close. She watched bath time and did story time at bed. 
Next day was when the little irritants start. Commenting on how we do diapers (cloth) and telling my ten month old son “good thing there’s a lid on those dirty diapers otherwise they’d kill you while you slept!” When my son flailed in my arms and smacked me in the face out of joy “oh! Hahaha only hits for Mommy!”  She acted dramatic about the food I fed him- we do baby led weening so he eats whole food- worried he was going to choke because we weren’t doing purées. We’ve asked her not to buy him clothes or gifts- she brought pajamas and three books with her. Last time she was here her perfume gave me a migraine, DH supposedly talked to her about it, she wore it. My baby smelled like her. She touched me SO MUCH but I didn’t say anything until…

The second night my baby woke up at about 4am crying. DH and I didn’t even have time to pull up the monitor before I heard her door open and MIL went into my baby’s room. I jump out of bed, DH gets up to beat me to it. I wait a minute, get dressed and go into the room. Baby is still crying and gets more upset when he hears my voice. I turn on a nightlight and ask “wtf is going on?” She touches me again on both shoulders to try and slide past me and I said “don’t touch me”. I take my baby, DH goes back to bed. 

I spend the rest of the night sleeping in my baby’s room because MIL picked him up and triggered his separation anxiety so he wouldn’t go back to sleep without me there. Next morning comes and his sleep is completely screwed the entire day because of this interruption. She hides in the guest room most of the morning, and when she gets up we are having breakfast and she says to my baby “ohh did we have a tummy ache last night” to which I replied, no, we didn’t. DH chimes in and says something to the effect “it’s ok Mama, we usually kind of let him soothe himself before going in. You didn’t know. It’s ok.” She said she did wait, which wasn’t true. She ended the conversation by saying “you try to do something good and just screw it up.” (Talking about herself) and gets up and leaves the room to pout. 

First nap of the day comes and unsurprising to me and no one else in the house, it takes over an hour for him to settle and only when I end up contact napping with him and PHYSICALLY RESTRAINING HIM to get him to calm down. That’s how messed up his schedule is. Right before I resign myself to contact napping I go out into the kitchen to grab a bottle, DH and MIL are playing cards at the table and I hear husband say “I’m working on it Mama” in a hushed tone. I knew they were talking about me. DH gets up and offers to tap in for me, I say no I got it, nice and calm. Then MIL starts to say something to me: “Honey you should…” I turned around and walked back to my baby’s room and said “dont tell me what to do. I got it.”

That was the last time I saw her because she decided to get a hotel and leave early because she “didn’t feel welcome” in our house. I made dinner twice. I encouraged her to spend time with my son. I was the one who invited her here. I cleaned her room, made the bed, made her coffee in the morning, talked to her and confided a tiny bit. DH wants me to apologize to her and I refuse. All her children coddle her and believe everything she says when she twists things to support her side of things. I feel like I tried with this woman, even felt sorry for her lack of emotional intelligence and upbringing that obviously made her this way. She lied to DH and said she was talking to him when she was looking right at me when she said “Honey why don’t you…”. He said he believes her. He said I should go to therapy because every time there’s something wrong with our baby I “overreact”. He said he’s trying to keep the peace and salvage the weekend by asking me to apologize. 

Now I’m sitting at home while DH is out with my baby having a goodbye lunch with his mother because I said they could without any stink. Because I’m crazy right?

In the past DH has expressed wanting to deal with MIL and have me refrain from saying anything, however, I feel like my boundaries are still being crossed in my own home so I decided to stand up for myself. DH thinks I should have just taken it and let him talk to her after she got home and the “dust had settled”. It’s not in my nature to allow someone to walk over me or to put up with inexcusable bad behavior from anyone, even family. I haven’t spoken to my own dad in years because he cannot behave himself. Should I have just let all this go and not pushed back? Was I wrong to be direct in the moment with this person? I’m afraid this is going to continue to cause issues in my marriage.

🔸 2. HYDRATION
	•	Daily water target:
Body weight (kg) × 0.033 = liters per day
	•	Add +0.5 L if it’s hot or training is intense.
	•	Electrolytes, tea, or infused water count. Coffee does not.

	•	Dedicate minimum 45 minutes daily to active learning.
	•	Study, read academic materials, develop a skill, or do creative learning work.

🔸 6. GROWTH TRACKERS
	•	📖 Read 10 pages of nonfiction or self-improvement daily.
	•	📸 Take a daily photo or short written reflection.

Kendu at 13 million market cap has reached unprecedented levels of IRL efforts, from energy drinks to coffee, to KenduSTREET to plushies we are literally changing the game one step at a time. Although we have over 20 IRL initiatives non are done by a ""team"" they are all done from individual community members. These are average people with full time jobs and many other responsibilities yet they still find time to push Kendu with IRL efforts which take hours upon hours of planning...

Imagine when Kendu is in the hundreds of millions and these holders are shit rich, there's gonna be a tidal wave of new efforts and this is literally gonna be impossible to keep up with. Although I am here daily I still miss many of these efforts and I have to catch up through monthly recaps😭

The monthly recap for September was absolutely insane although September is typically a very poor month for crypto, the Kendu community did not slow down, they kept innovating and revolutionising the space from Kendu NFTs to Kendu Spice, to random posts to Dutch community members, to new Kendu Energy flavours, to a Kendu radio show to Kendu Unleashed...

Like this is literally crazy, this alone is extremely groundbreaking yet it is just another month for Kendu, we don't falter on social media efforts either.

We have:

* X efforts that rival the very best, I unfortunately cannot say that Kendu has the strongest X community simply because idk how you would measure it and I don't wanna make false statements
* Reddit efforts are simply number 1, check any crypto subreddit and you will see Kendu with far more posts and more engagement than any other coin, with also a very large subreddit
* Stocktwits, Kendu is number 1 by far, we have an insane presence and routinely win competitions
* Recently won CMC's BOOST ME COMPETITION and was one of the only projects to use no AI
* In MaestroBot's 250k Battle Royale, competing against 31 other projects on BASE
* We have TikTok efforts that are ramping up marking a new effort
* We also have an Instagram presence which gathers lots of interest from non holders

Kendu's community is that strong we are groundbreaking in both IRL and social media, which rivals the very best communities to ever come out of crypto. We are doing this at 13 million market cap, imagine what will happen as Kendu grows and we get more and more community members...

Kendu is a tidal wave waiting to happen and we are not one to miss, we are so undervalued but as we all know crypto changes so fast...

1nyys2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1nyys2y/parasites_vs_mold/,Parasites vs Mold,"Hey guys :) I can eat almost anything except big histamin loaded food, especially liberators (they are so much worse, e.g. lemon, mushrooms etc). If I'm eating low histamine (very versatile not like chicken and rice) and drink my nettle lemongrass berberine tea, I feel almost perfect. No bloating or other symptoms.

I can also eat some histamine loaded stuff even coffee. I only get a reaction of dizziness like Im a bit drunk + headache if I consume liberators, like too much caffeine or other stuff. I got worse after Covid Jab btw. regarding histamine reactions.

Do you think this is leaning more towards mold or parasites? I suffer from klebsiella and some SIBO but I want to find the root cause. Im not sure if the Jab was the root cause. I live in germany and its really hard here to test for mycotoxins. Parasites is doable but random, because not every test shows parasite eggs so its 50 50. Any help is aprreciated.
