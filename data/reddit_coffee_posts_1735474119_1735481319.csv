1howo3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextBestBro/comments/1howo3z/28_bi_latino/,28 Bi Latino,Hey everyone! 28 Bi Latino guy in the East Coast of the US. I’m a very nerdy guy who loves tv and movies. Really enjoy all things Marvel. Just getting into the comics but love the movies and tv shows. I also enjoy sitcoms like the office and parks and rec. In my free time I like drawing and reading or when I can hiking and adventuring. I like to stay fit and would love a bro who’s the same. Don’t have many close friends right now since they have moved away so it’s left me a bit lonely. I love to chat a lot so I try to keep the conversation going. I’m also a coffee lover and I bake sometimes. Eventually if we get to know each other more we can move to another platform and I’m ver open minded and I don’t mind having some NSFW conversations and sharing. But anyways send me a message if you think we click.,1,1735481177.0,NextBestBro,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1735480902.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

Boas!

Quero partilhar um pequeno projeto que criei.

Im pretty new to 3d printing, but im an enthusiastic junior.  
About 4 months ago i got a BambuLab P1S, and started printing in PLA, everything went well, even tried some TPU, but just some minor parts.  
About a month ago i tried printing in PETG, and it went well too without drying(I thought it was fine as the filament was brand new when i printed with it)  
For christmas i got a filament dryer, so i dried my remaining PETG, and wanted to print with it again.  
I modeled this simple replacement part for my coffee machine, and tried to print it, but in the end it ended up about 4mms wider than the model was. I thought it might be warping, as i have read about 3d prints getting warped before, but every other dimension seems accurate.  
I have 255 hours on the printer so far... I dont know, is it possible that something got loose and that causes the inaccuracy?  
Also i know that there are imperfections in the printed model, but im fine with it in this case... it wont be seen anyways.

I need help, I don't know what to do.

I think that I've never actually fell in love, I'm 16 so it's not a big deal, but recently I realised that I hardly catch feelings and all the people around me have crushes, but for me, even if I like someone it's hard for me to accept it and I usually push it away.
 
Alright so.. here's this one guy from my class who is pretty much attractive (for my taste) and very nice and he contacted my bestie confessed he had a crush on me.
We knew each other for a year and a half but I didn't speak with him (even tho I found him attractive when we first met, after some time I just forgot about his existence and found him kind of weird tbh, even though he's kinda cool)

And such news schocked me, and I was even more schocked when he asked me on a date out of the blue. I think that the word ""date"" scared me more than actually going out with him. But after some awkward talk (I even said it would be awkward, damn I'm the worst) I said yes, because ""what's the worst thing that can happen?"" And I realised it's worth giving him a chance because I can't reject him if I know nothing about him.

After our date, I felt kind of anxious amd worried because I knew I'll have to say no to the 2nd date because even though I wnjoyed our date and everything was fine-I enjoy going out with my friends aswell, and I didn't feel some romantic spark you know.. and I didn't want to lead him on because if I said yes to the second date, he will think that I have romantic fewlings about him, just like he does and I'd feel like lying to him. A frinedly coffe would be much more appropriate.

When he asked me on a 2nd date- I didn't know what to do, how can I reject him but without rejecting him or saying tgat something's wrong with him (it isn't). I was scared everything was going fast and I figured it's better that we start as friends. And I wanted to say that: but I said that it's complicated because we are in the same class and If we wnet out anymore- I'd see it in a friendly way.

And after that we stopped talking, he didn't even bother to look at me, I missed him. I asked him out for a coffee (friendly hangout) to make sure I didn't completely end things because I really didn't want to and honestly the only thrope I brlieve in is friends to lovers or slow burn.  I've never been in a relationship so comittment seems kimd of scary.

And after that we were less close, talked once a week, and went out a couple of times,  but I kept missing him.and thinking about him for 2 whole months. And now, recently he started sending messages more often (every day, just like in the beginning) and he hugged me last 2 times we went out. 

Honestly he's such a sweet guy, he's tall, handsome, caring... qnd I could see us together, but when we are together I feel more of a friendly vibe you know.. there's no ""spark"" or ""butterflies""

If he asks me to be in a relationship with him, I don't know what to do:
I don't know what I feel, and I don't want to be woth him if I'm not 100% sure about my emotions,
But I don't want him to leave, it's good talking to him and I don't want to go back to that time I friendzoned him because I' sure we both felt awful back then.

I don't know do I not like him, or am I repressing ny feelings beacuse of fear and pride (and I know that our relationship wouldn't be easy and I might get judged for it if I cime back to school, and it's pretty much risky for our reputations, but still 2 girls from my class saw us together and honetsly I didn't really care- but still mostyl because we aren't together and I was fine with that)

I don't know do I not like him, or am I repressing ny feelings beacuse of fear and pride (and I know that our relationship wouldn't be easy and I might get judged for it if I cime back to school, and it's pretty much risky for our reputations, but still 2 girls from my class saw us together and honetsly I didn't really care- but still mostyl because we aren't together and I was fine with that)

So it's become quite apparent that I may well have ADHD my concentration is abysmal among other things. However I have a genuine fear of going through the NHS system for anything mental health related. The reason for this is my biological mother was diagnosed with Schizophrenia in the early 80's this resulted in me having to survive the state care system till running away at 14 for my own safety (I'm an adult late 30's). 

I have done some psychology studies, done trauma work and even been advised by Psychologists that if my Mum was alive today she would not have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. I understand the history around black women being wrongly diagnosed during the 80's and from understanding  some of her life I tend to agree. I also have learned that undiagnosed ADHD can progress into Schizophrenia. HOWEVER, the fear still remains no matter how I try to outsmart it was intellect, logic or rationalisation, I'm finding it difficult to complete and submit the forms.

I don't want to be wrongly diagnosed. Or have a diagnosis based on family history which disregarded the reality of psychological impact that racism, isolation, trauma and environment was having back then.

I don't have enough money to go private and using exercise and coffee to keep focus doesn't work as well as it used so not sure I should just push through until I can esp if I never get to that point because I'm not effectively productive!

Should I just leave my family history off the form?

  
Also I have no one to ask about what I was like as a child, does it really matter? This is really stressful and bringing up a lot of stuff like realising I have no idea about what I was like as a baby at birth or young child in school etc. 

I hate it, for those of you diagnosed is it really worth it? ",2,1735479423.0,BlackWomenADHD,0,1.0,False

i’m a barista who is coming up on three years with the company, having worked at five different stores in that time. with that said, i have quite a bit of experience and i’ve had to learn to adapt to new environments and store cultures somewhat quickly. i’ve meshed well with a majority of the people i’ve worked with and stores i’ve worked at as i try to maintain a positive attitude at work and keep spirits high. as high as they can be, anyway. as of late ive been working 40-45 hour weeks, picking up shifts at multiple different stores, etc etc.  just some context before i get into my main problem lol.

ive been at my current store for maybe seven or eight months now and its probably the best managed store ive worked at thus far. not the best. just the best managed. because apparently there’s a difference

in the past few months, i’ve had multiple talks with my SM and ASM (even including a write up) for things i’d say aren’t actually… things that i do? or that it’s something that everyone does and for whatever reason im the one to catch flack for it. at first the complaints about me to my SM and ASM were about phone usage, which i would understand if it weren’t for the fact that everyone else also uses their phones while on the floor. i’ve had a lot of personal issues in the past year, many of which are things that i cannot ignore if something comes up while im at work, so yes… i would send a text or two while on the clock. only really when it was urgent. i received verbal warnings for this (as in “can you put that away for right now”, not “don’t use your phone ever”) after which i would put my phone  up for the rest of my shift. it seems that that still wasn’t good enough because i ended up receiving a write up for it…and when i divulged why i was checking my phone somewhat frequently (i am financially responsible for my disabled mother, she has been wholly dependent on me for a while) the response was, and i quote: “i understand taking a phone call every once and a while but not three or four times in a shift. and with all due respect, is there really anything you can do about that?”

“that” being the disabled mother who is financially dependent on me. which i had just explained. but whatever. i signed the write up because clearly i wasnt going to get anywhere by arguing. kinda regret it though not gonna lie.

after getting written up for phone usage by my ASM for having my phone out AT ALL, several baristas, SSVs, and even the SAME ASM that wrote me up have all pulled their phones out to show each other pictures, text friends, etc. the ASM that wrote me up literally showed me a picture of her cat fountain after writing me up for being on my phone on the floor. so much for “no phones on the floor”.

also i don’t take phone calls at work??????

so anyway, i started leaving my phone in my bag or keeping it in my back pocket but leaving my vibrate on, not checking it, etc just in case something happened…because clearly i cant even send a quick text or check the time without a barista or SSV taking issue with it, even if its important. i thought that everything was fine because ive been trying to take steps to improve. howeverrrrr

my SM pulled me aside the other day to talk about things she’s been hearing from SSVs and baristas. so it’s no longer a phone usage issue, and it’s now “lacking a sense of urgency” which to me just sounds like my coworkers think i’m lazy. they feel like they’re picking up my slack, like they’re closing alone, idk. i didn’t really hear anything about a “sense of urgency” or lack thereof before the phone thing and it’s not like i’ve suddenly gotten bad at my job since i started leaving my phone in my bag…i’m not claiming to be the fastest or best barista in the world but like… i know i have at least a halfway decent work ethic.

all this being said though, i’m not sure whether to actually take any of this seriously because of how my coworkers treat me just like… day to day. before i say what im about to say, i really don’t need anyone to like me. i truly don’t mind someone disliking me. i dislike these people too. but at the end of the day, it’s just coffee. so there’s no need for drama or pettiness or whatever else. but it’s getting to the point where i feel like i’m being held under a microscope. 

here’s a couple incidents i can think of to give you an idea of what i mean:

1) i’ve been in a really rough financial position lately so i try not to buy new things. including shoes, i wear them until the wheels fall off. or in this case, the sole. the sole of my shoe started coming off mid-close but its not the first time so i kept it pushing. but because it was lowkey hanging off of my shoe lol it kinda scraped on the mats. not loudly, just like. made a small noise. i guess my SSV didn’t like this and as i was walking behind her, unprompted, said “can you pick up your feet when you walk? it’s just like.. the noise.”

2) same SSV and ASM were talking shit about other managers. someone mentions a manager at a different store and something about scheduling issues. i was not a part of this conversation, but i said “yeah ive been working over there recently & (SM name)’s schedules have been weird”… SSV immediately cuts me off to say “nope we’re not talking bad about other managers, especially him because i love him”…keep in mind this SM for another store started throwing me on his schedule without asking. when i was carless. i didn’t mention that part but that’s what i was referring to.

3) i forgot to fill one out of two ice bins and left it half full. i admit that’s my bad lol. but the other barista i closed with took a picture, sent it to me, and sent a second text “you forgot to fill the ice bin.” when i asked if she wanted me to come back in and fill it, no response. 

this isn’t a specific incident but more of a reoccurring thing- it’s pretty common for me to come in and the only time someone will speak to me is to criticize something i’m doing or tell me what to do. meanwhile they’re laughing in the back and making plans with each other like… over the headset. again, i don’t really care if these people don’t like me, but that sort of behavior definitely makes most people feel alienated.

i’ll also say for #1 and #3, i mentioned these specifically to my SM and she said she didn’t really condone either of those and that she has to talk to those people about like… idk. their attitudes? something like that. including another person who went off on me for asking if they had punched in an order i took over the headset while they were with a customer at the window. thankfully during this conversation my SM was mostly presenting me with what she had been hearing rather than scolding me, so i told her where i was coming from as well. she and i don’t work together very often so she quite literally has to rely on word of mouth. and most if not all of it is negative lol.

i’m not really sure if im asking for advice or if im just venting… but idk. its been getting to me because no matter what i do to try and improve, it seems like its just getting worse. there’s one or two baristas at that store that genuinely are great people and i get along with them, and even they have said that they’ve noticed this behavior from the other people working there. and this is coming from baristas who have been working there maybe a year or two. idk if anyone has advice im open to it but i think im just getting increasingly more frustrated with the cliquey starbucks social culture

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my recent experience with caffeine after being 235 days coffee-free. I initially quit because I was tired of the ups and downs and wanted a more stable baseline. The first three months of quitting were brutal – depression, fatigue, headaches – it felt like crawling through hell. But eventually, I felt stable, clear-headed, and proud of my progress.

Over the Christmas holidays, I decided, “What harm could two days of coffee do?” I thought I could enjoy a little indulgence and go back to decaf. I went all in, drinking espressos both days. The first day felt amazing – the energy rush was unreal. But that night, I couldn’t sleep and stayed awake until 6 AM.

Day two was rough. Exhausted from barely any sleep, I reached for more espresso to get through the day. By the end, I felt overstimulated, emotional, and easily agitated. It was a mistake, plain and simple.

Now, I’m feeling regretful and lamlendig (sorry, couldn’t find the perfect English word for it – sluggish, drained, and off). I’m restarting my caffeine-free journey tomorrow. This slip-up was a harsh reminder of why I quit in the first place.

If you’re thinking about testing the waters with caffeine after quitting, please think twice. The fallout isn’t worth it, and now I’m back at square one. I’d love to hear how others managed to bounce back from a relapse – any tips or encouragement would mean a lot.

Thanks for reading, and let’s stay strong together.

1how2es,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1how2es/how_to_make_german_friends_in_germany_from_a/,How to make German friends in Germany - from a German ,"I often see questions about how to make friends with Germans and that it is not that easy. I want to show you how it is really simple and how you can quickly make German friends. We are just as nice as everybody else and we even have a good sense of humour. 

The general advice about being social and friendly, asking questions, inviting people out, etc. are the basics. But here are my tips.

1. Make a real effort to become really good at German

This is the biggest mistake I see lots of people do. They can't speak fluent German even after living here for years. It is mostly because they spend a lot or most of their time with people from their country or other expats who speak English. You can't make German friends if you're German is not proficient enough. When I went to France I started to make French friends once my French was good enough. So really focus on getting good at German in the first few months after arriving.

2. Don't spend too much with internationals 

This ties into the first point. I know it's nice to have people from your home country to talk to. But that will prevent you from speaking and learning German and integrating into German culture. You can always make these kinds of friends after a while. It is more difficult to get out of your international friend circle one you are comfortable. 

3. Meet people where they are regularly

If you think about, how did you make friends in schools? You played football or went to the ame school. You saw each other often and that's how you became friends. So try to a) have a schedule that makes it possible for people to meet you/run into you and b) go somewhere where you see people ok a regular basics. Having a regular schedule is often an issue for expats that live in big cities and travel a lot that's preventing friendships to occur naturally. It's important you do something you like. I like the Gym and dance classes. You might like football or cooking. Find something local and try to go there regularly. Bonus tip: Germans love Vereine (Sport associations). I would join one with a sport / activity you like and you will have friends in no time. Gym classes also work great. If you like music, try going to concerts, etc.

4. Group meetings first, personal meetings second

If you just meet someone, inviting them for a one-on-one coffee might be a bit too fast for us. We are a bit more reserved than other cultures. Instead, try to invite people to group activities like game evenings, cooking together, going to a club or the cinema, watching football (this ALWAYS works!), etc.

5. Go where Germans and internationals mix 

I personally was a member of Toastmasters and I was able to meet local and international friends all over the world. There are language cafés, etc. im most major cities so check them out. It's also a great way for you to become good at German fast.

6. Use online platforms to meet new people

There are sites like Meetup, Eventbrite, Spontacts, Meet5 are a great way to see what people organize and meet some open strangers.

7. Be more direct 

We are a direct bunch of people who express what they want, like or dislike directly. It is common in different cultures to be more indirect to not embarrass others, etc. As long as you don't critique others in front of a group, just say what you think in a nice way. We won't be offended. We are used to it.

8. You will be rejected and it will hurt ... In the beginning

Moving to any new country is a big move and trying to meet the locals is always a bit awkward at first. But you have either the options of being rejected a couple of times in the beginning and eventually making some German friends or never going beyond that and failing to make many friends / learn German fluently. I've seen too many people give up to early and regretting it years later. It will be a bit challenging, but you can do it! ",14,1735479104.0,germany,8,0.82,False

A few years ago I moved here, to get a house on the property ladder. The idea was to move back to the city, delayed due to pandemic and lack of house renovation and jobs fell through, but back on track now. During the pandemic we thought we would just stay here indefinitely, but we aren't happy here and we want to continue with the original plan. 
My mil has found out that we want to leave this town, and has been love bonding us, especially after she had a paddy that we were not baby sitting her grandchildren enough and we stood up for ourselves.
I've since found out that she doesn't want to baby sit her grandchildren as much and her daughter is constantly guilt tripping her about it. 
I have not been included in family activities , dynamics , unless it is a favour for them. I wasn't even asked to be a god mother ( one of 13 ) in the most heartless way a few years ago , and I felt mean but I thought that's it. You have all made it very clear where I stand , I'm not amending my plans to baby sit or walk your dogs anymore. 
My MIL and sil know my partner work nights , and my only friend here moved away. So I'd go to my mil for tea or coffee or go out for games of bingo with her. My mil one day said her daughter was jealous that she couldn't go to bingo and jealous i spent time with her mum , and I stopped being invited to go. 
That fully solidified in my mind where I stood. What hurts is the   other DIL ( married to sil) is really treated like family. This is before they even had kids. Everything they do is just fantastic she's so proud of them, but just critises us, me , her son , and her son's choices. I used to feel bad that we planned to move away, but we really don't feel like part of their family. I have bought gifts and presents for SIL children, and not so much as thank you or anything. So I have just stopped bothering. I also got confronted that I visit my mother and kid sibling twice a month but not them ( I was confused as I work , and my in-laws never text me back or commit to plans , I don't see why I should have to beg to have their time?) 
It is not my fault her brother doesn't really want to see her. He isn't his sister's biggest fan. 
Anyway, I just feel sad, Id have actually loved to be able to take her toddler out for days out , baby sit etc , but they just don't like me. I feel awkward around them all. They know I can't drop the children to school or baby sit in the week as I work , and they did a good job of making me feel bad for this. So much so that in the beginning I used annual leave days to help them and then they didn't need my help etc. 
Don't know why I'm ranting I just feel bad and unloved. I really can't wait to move from here and have a fresh start.  Thanks for listening

This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a *erver which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

That's some stuff atleast. I'm also kinda introverted, and my energy fluctuate quite a bit, so if i don't respond, don't take it personal!

# Hello!

As i get older and older, i have less and less friends. Most of the people i used to hangout with online are the same age as me, and now have kids/spouses and in general a lot more going on in life then me. So i'm mostly just hanging out with myself! Which kinda sucks, tbh. So i'm just on the lookout for anyone that values spending time together, online. I miss sitting in calls, talking about whatever, watching stuff together on either discord screenshare, or plex. And just playing games in general. I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining good health, yet many people overlook the importance of drinking enough water. By understanding the essential benefits of drinking water, you can make informed choices to enhance your overall wellbeing. Here's a closer look at the reasons why water is so vital for a healthier life.

### 1. Promotes Hydration

Your body is made up of about 60% water, so staying hydrated is key. When you drink enough water, it helps maintain the balance of bodily fluids. These fluids are essential for various functions, including digestion, absorption, circulation, and even temperature regulation. Just a little dehydration can lead to feeling tired or lethargic.

### 2. Supports Weight Loss

If you're looking to shed some extra pounds, drinking water can be a valuable tool. Water can help you feel full, meaning you might eat less during meals. Additionally, sometimes our bodies confuse thirst with hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Staying well-hydrated helps you avoid those extra calories.

### 3. Enhances Physical Performance

Physical activity increases the need for hydration. When you exercise, your body loses water through sweat, which can impair performance. Drinking water before, during, and after exercise can help maintain your endurance and prevent fatigue. Athletes often notice improved strength and stamina when they are adequately hydrated.

### 4. Improves Skin Health

Your skin is the largest organ of your body, and hydration plays an important role in keeping it healthy. Drinking adequate water can help maintain skin elasticity and appearance. When your skin is well-hydrated, it looks plumper and more radiant, helping to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

### 5. Aids Digestion

Water is essential for digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients, making them more accessible to your body. Also, sufficient fluid intake prevents constipation by softening your stool, making it easier to pass. If you’re struggling with digestive issues, increasing your water intake may provide much-needed relief.

### 6. Boosts Kidney Function

Your kidneys play a significant role in filtering waste from the blood. They require water to function effectively. Drinking enough water helps prevent kidney stones and urinary tract infections, making it essential for maintaining urinary tract health. With adequate hydration, your kidneys can flush out toxins more efficiently.

### 7. Regulates Body Temperature

Water is vital for temperature regulation. When your body overheats, sweating occurs to cool you down. This process requires adequate water levels. If you are dehydrated, your body is less capable of regulating its temperature, which can lead to heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Staying hydrated is especially important during hot weather or when exercising outdoors.

### 8. Enhances Brain Function

Water is necessary for optimal brain function. Dehydration can affect your mood, memory, and cognitive abilities. Recent studies have shown that mild dehydration can lead to difficulties in focusing and increased feelings of anxiety. By maintaining hydration, you can support your brain's health and improve concentration.

### 9. Boosts Immune System

A well-hydrated body is better equipped to fend off illnesses. When you're hydrated, your body can efficiently circulate nutrients and expel waste, which is crucial for overall health. Drinking enough water bolsters your immune system by helping to keep your throat and nasal passages moist, reducing the risk of colds and respiratory infections.

### 10. Promotes Cardiovascular Health

Drinking enough water is key to maintaining healthy blood flow and circulation. When properly hydrated, blood volume is optimized, allowing the heart to pump more efficiently. This can lower your risk of heart disease and improve overall cardiovascular health.

Understanding the essential benefits of drinking water can lead to greater health and wellbeing. From aiding digestion to enhancing brain function, water is a simple, yet powerful, contributor to your health. Remember to listen to your body and drink water regularly to reap the many benefits it offers. Your health deserves it!

How Hydration Affects Physical Performance
------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for maintaining optimal physical performance, whether you're exercising, playing sports, or just going about your daily activities. When your body receives adequate water intake, it can function effectively and efficiently. Here’s how hydration affects your physical performance.

### Energy Levels

Water plays a crucial role in energy production. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, affecting your energy levels during workouts. Proper hydration ensures that your muscles have the nutrients they need to generate energy effectively. When you drink enough water, you can perform at your best.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Cognitive Function

Your brain is highly sensitive to dehydration. Even mild fluid loss can impair cognitive functions like memory, attention, and decision-making. This is particularly important in sports or activities requiring quick thinking. Staying hydrated helps you maintain focus, coordinate your movements, and react swiftly, all of which are critical for performance.

### Muscle Function

Water is essential for muscle contractions. When adequately hydrated, your muscles work more efficiently and can build strength. During exercise, you lose fluids through sweat, which can lead to muscle cramps if not replenished. Drinking water before, during, and after activity helps maintain muscle hydration, reducing the risk of cramps and ensuring optimal performance.

### Temperature Regulation

One of the most important roles of hydration is temperature regulation. When you exercise, your body temperature rises, and sweating is your body's way of cooling down. Proper hydration allows your body to sweat effectively. If you're dehydrated, your ability to cool down diminishes, leading to overheating. This can severely affect your performance and increase the risk of heat-related illnesses.

### Endurance and Stamina

Long-duration activities, like running or cycling, can lead to significant fluid losses. Keeping your hydration levels up is essential to sustain your endurance and stamina. Studies have shown that even a 2% reduction in body weight due to dehydration can negatively influence performance. To maintain your peak levels, drink water consistently throughout your activity.

### Recovery

Hydration is essential not only during exercise but also for recovery afterward. Water helps transport nutrients and oxygen to your muscles, aiding in their repair. Proper hydration can reduce soreness and speed up recovery time, allowing you to train harder and more frequently.

### Joint Lubrication

Your joints require lubrication to function correctly, and water plays a key role in this process. Adequate hydration helps maintain the viscosity of synovial fluid, which cushions your joints during movement. This reduces the risk of injuries and improves your overall physical performance.

### Cardiovascular Function

Staying hydrated supports your heart health. When you’re dehydrated, your blood volume decreases, making your heart work harder to pump blood. This can lead to an increased heart rate and reduced aerobic capacity, negatively impacting your performance. Drinking water helps maintain normal blood volume and optimizes circulation, keeping your heart functioning at its best.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

- **Drink Water Regularly:** Don’t wait until you feel thirsty. Make a habit of drinking water throughout the day.
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a water bottle handy encourages you to sip water often.
- **Monitor Urine Color:** Light yellow usually indicates proper hydration. Dark urine may suggest you need to drink more water.
- **Include Hydrating Foods:** Foods like fruits and vegetables have high water content and contribute to your hydration levels.
- **Set Reminders:** Use phone reminders or apps to prompt you to drink water regularly.

Maintaining proper hydration is key for enhancing physical performance. From energy levels to muscle function, water impacts every aspect of your physical activity. By understanding the necessity of hydration and proactively ensuring your fluid intake, you can achieve your fitness goals and perform at your absolute best.

The Role of Water in Weight Management
--------------------------------------

Water plays a crucial role in our daily lives, especially when it comes to weight management.

### Hydration and Metabolism

Your metabolism is the process your body uses to convert food into energy. Drinking enough water can boost this process, helping you burn more calories. Studies suggest that consuming 500ml of water can temporarily increase metabolic rate by about 30%. If you aim to drink water regularly, you could see an improvement in how effectively your body uses energy.

### Reducing Hunger

Often, we mistake thirst for hunger. When you’re dehydrated, your body sends signals that can be confusing. Instead of reaching for that snack, try drinking a glass of water first. This can help reduce your appetite, leading to lower calorie intake throughout the day.

### Water as a Low-Calorie Beverage

When managing weight, choosing beverages wisely is crucial. Many drinks are loaded with hidden calories and sugars. Water, on the other hand, is calorie-free. By replacing sugary drinks or high-calorie beverages with water, you can significantly cut your caloric intake. This simple swap can contribute to weight loss without you even realizing it.

### Improving Physical Performance

Staying hydrated helps maintain strong physical performance. Whether it’s jogging, weightlifting, or any other activity, even mild dehydration can impair your ability to exercise optimally. By drinking water, you can enhance your endurance and strength, leading to a more effective workout routine. This means you burn more calories during your physical activities.

Good hydration is essential for effective digestion. Water helps break down food so your body can absorb nutrients better. It also aids in preventing constipation. A well-functioning digestive system allows for more efficient weight management, as your body can use the nutrients effectively and expel waste products without issue.

### The Role of Water in Caloric Restriction

In many weight loss plans, caloric restriction is a common method to shed pounds. Drinking water can support this process by providing a feeling of fullness without adding calories. When you’re on a diet, incorporating water into your meals can help you manage your hunger and adhere to your caloric goals.

### Flavoring Your Water

If plain water isn’t your favorite, consider adding natural flavorings. Fruits like lemon, lime, or berries can enhance the taste without excessive calories. Herb infusions, such as mint or basil, add a refreshing twist too. Not only do these additions make drinking water more enjoyable, but they also contribute extra nutrients and antioxidants.

### Reducing Salt Intake

When you’re well-hydrated, you may notice a decrease in cravings for salty foods. High sodium levels can lead to water retention, making you feel bloated and uncomfortable. By drinking enough water, you can help flush out excess salt from your body. This can lead to a more balanced diet and help maintain a healthy weight.

- **Drink a glass of water before every meal:** This will help you reduce your appetite and enhance digestion.

Enough water into your daily routine can have a profound impact on your weight management efforts. Not only is it a vital component for overall health, but it also helps you feel better physically and mentally. So, next time you think about reaching for that sugary drink or high-calorie snack, remember the immense benefits of drinking water. Your weight management journey may just become a bit easier with this simple yet powerful habit.

Water is essential for healing skin conditions, such as cuts or burns. Adequate hydration encourages a healthy immune response, which can speed up the healing process. Drinking enough water can help your skin recover quickly from irritation, aiding in its overall health.

**First to give you some back story about my sleep journey.**

I’ve struggled with falling asleep, staying asleep; waking up, having a good sleep schedule/rhythm. . the list goes on

This is really a terrible problem to have, if you can’t get a good night's rest before an important event, or enough to stay healthy it can really negatively impact your mood, productivity, focus, and even intelligence.

I used to be extremely guilty of not being a morning person, snapping on people I love because I just was so tired and irritable 24/7

I decided if I was going to live until 60 that I needed to get my sleep in check. I’m a very scientific person, so I dived deep into sleep research. It’s pretty amazing how far things have come even in the past 10 years

There’s still a lot about sleep that science can’t explain, so for the sake of being thorough I didn’t ignore wives tales, colloquialisms, or “non-scientific “ sleep aids in my research

The good news is we understand the falling asleep part very well. It's what happens while you're asleep part we don’t understand as deeply.

So in this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that cause you to fall asleep and then I'm gonna tell you **how to hack these systems** in your body to make falling asleep your superpower.

If you don’t care about the science I'll be breaking the post down like this so you can skip around

* **What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)**
   * How Adenosine affects intelligence & personality
   * How Adenosine affects health 
   * What Caffeine does
* **Cortisol and Sleep** 
   * What does Cortisol do?
   *  How to manage Cortisol

# What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)

Adenosine is this crazy, misunderstood molecule. I call it the sleep molecule and it’s really the hero of our bodies but most of us hate it.

See Adenosine’s only job in the body is to make sure you get enough sleep, and it's very very good at making your life increasingly miserable until you do.

**How Adenosine affects health** 

So while most people think the effects of not enough sleep are grumpiness, sleepiness, memory loss. This is actually adenosine trying its best to protect you from the real effects of not getting enough sleep

* Type 2 diabetes 
* Colon cancer
* High blood pressure
* Dementia,
* Death. (Literally.)

So who’s the bad guy again?

Down to its core, Adenosine is just a neurotransmitter in our nervous system that builds up the longer we stay awake

It binds to receptors and sends electrical signals through your nervous system telling it to start feeling sleepy. The miserable days  come when Adenosine levels rise early and often.  And it's almost always because you are fighting against Adenosine instead of working with it.

**What Caffeine does**

Our societal response to fighting the sense of sleepiness and tiredness is caffeine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine receptors like a car in someone’s parking spot–but it can only hold the spot for so long.

When the caffeine wears off (4-6 hours on average), the parking spot is empty again. And all this Adenosine has just been waiting in the street ready to surge into the spots that caffeine was blocking just minutes before.

This Is The Crash…

But what's making all of this Adenosine?

It’s not just enough for us to understand what Adenosine does, if we want to live in unison with it, we need to know how it is made.

Adenosine comes from several processes in the body, but there's one commonality between them all.

They are all byproducts of releasing energy. Essentially you can think of it this way. Every time your body consumes ATP and expends energy, Adenosine is produced.

Now Adenosine flows through your brain, attacking your function. Begging you to shut down before it's too late.

**How Adenosine affects intelligence & Personality**

Higher Adenosine is correlated with mood swings, frustration, anger, stress. In other words, grumpiness. It sneaks into your personal and emotional life without permission and causes you to act out of character. Lash out at loved ones, and make bad decisions. 

Adenosine also attacks your cognitive function, making it harder to think, remember things, and put ideas together. All of your thoughts become slow through the fog of weariness. 

Interestingly, at a certain point the stress adenosine causes in the body triggers a cascade of adrenaline and other hormone release that can temporarily overpower the effects and give a “second wind” but I'll touch on that in another post.

So we know we can't win the fight against the sleep molecule. Our only choice is to live in harmony with it. This alignment will create harmony in day and night like a violin in Legato. Soothing you in your sleep and lifestyle. But there’s one major force impacting this harmony that we have to understand first.

Adenosine is the mechanism that drives sleepiness, but what is the mechanism that drives wakefulness?

# Cortisol and Sleep 

Now that you understand that Adenosine is like a policeman walking throughout your entire body ensuring you get the rest you need. Let's introduce something called Cortisol.

**What does Cortisol do?**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that peaks in the morning to promote alertness and declines at night to support restful sleep. 

Unlike Adenosine, Cortisol is a Hormone. It is released from your adrenal glands and not billions of cells. This is neat because all glands have a trigger to them, like a gun. 

When the trigger is squeezed by a number of sensory inputs we will discuss later, a pulse of Cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream. 

So regardless of what sensory input causes the release of Cortisol—whether it's you waking up or your alarm clock—it alerts your entire nervous system and musculoskeletal system that it's time to start moving. Declaring a new and fresh day–

Or at least trying to. When you have trouble getting out of bed and starting your day it’s because  your adrenal glands are misfiring.

Failing to release this hormone into your bloodstream—and letting early Adenosine levels have their way with you leaves you no choice but to pour up that hot cup of coffee. 

Like a car,  you can fix the misfiring of your adrenal glands, it just needs an oil change and some tuning

**How to manage Cortisol**

The most effective sensory input that triggers that strong pulse of Cortisol from your adrenal glands is Sunlight.

This is how the adrenal glands get the green light to release these hormones. They respond to the Hypothalamus, a region in the brain that monitors sunlight. 

When sunlight is detected, a chemical signal is shot down to the adrenal glands that causes the firing of the hormone. The brighter the sunlight the stronger the signal. When sunlight is detected from a low solar angle (like sunrise) the chemical signal is amplified.

Misfiring and malfunction of the adrenal gland is rare when the signal is strong and direct. \[see process below\]

So, if your lifestyle requires you to be up early in the morning, it is very important that this pulse of cortisol is released early. It should be like a rising tide early in the day and recede as the day progresses.

While I did say sunlight is the most effective sensory input, notice that the strength of the signal to release Cortisol is dependent only on brightness. So for those early birds that beat the sun u\[p, there’s still hope. There’s actually an upside of beating the sun.

Because physical exercise and fitness also serves as strong sensory input that triggers the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. That is why those who typically work out in the morning are more alert compared to those who don't. 

This also means that if you are working out in the late evening, closer to your bedtime, you are fighting uphill against those cortisol levels to fall asleep.

Now imagine waking up early, going on a walk or slow run, soaking in the sunrise, flooding your body with Cortisol, and then starting your day.

When you pair the healthy relationship between the sleep drive molecule and the wake rive molecule, you enter a completely different realm of restfulness and wakefulness. This is how you make your sleep your superpower. \[see sleep/wake cycle below\]

The two drives work In complete harmony, mimicking one another, and elevating your sense of being.

With a strong and steady sleep and wake drive cycle, understanding and fixing  your circadian rhythm is a downhill battle now. And the solution should make much more sense.

Now that you know how to manage that wakefulness and sleepiness drive, let's talk about how to maximize that sleep you do get and how to get the most out of it.

I came to the UK August 2020 with 26 yrs old to live in London, started working as a delivery driver due some of the lockdown restrictions and lack of jobs, and was having a great time in my life financially and enjoying sightseeing, but as I was young never had a relationship before as I was focusing on saving some money to come to Europe since my family comes from Italy and I wanted to be close to Italian culture again. I had some casual sex, and I had with 4 to 5 people before nothing long, and then one day I met an woman(F) at the time she was 38 or 39 yrs old coming from a break up relationship after being married for 20 yrs, her ex at the time became gay. I had about couple times sex with her like for fun and enjoying because I didn’t do much it before and I was having fun but deep down I knew we were not made to be couple, but the same time both of us enjoyed the attention we were giving to each other, I come from a family where we call people, lovely, angel, nice, hugs, kisses in the cheek, probably a bit different from the English Culture. There was a day she asked me if we were a couple and I said No we are not we just enjoying each other, but also I don’t know how to explain or maybe I wasn’t very direct at the time I was feeling a different energy like a heavy energy I would say for both sides and I said to her I couldn’t do more casual sex to her or anyone cause the energy I got was overwhelming and I said I can be friends if you want I will stop casual sex. She said we could be friends but at the time I knew that wasn’t correct as well because could be confusing for both, and I think even when I was lonely I still at that time could have control of my thoughts, goals and dreams. So by 2021 when we stopped sex she went for dating but nothing serious happened for her and then our friendship became strong, because we were talking to each other everyday and having fun, I used to sing on the phone, laugh lots like talk my politics shit, talking about travelling, dreams, goals and everything I always have been free spirit.  So was a strong bond or connection as you can say.
By the time 2021 like September, October some of my friends started telling me - look it seems you guys are in a relationship instead of a friendship, everything you do is like what a couple do, this is not healthy for you and not healthy for her, and the time by I need to give more and more my energy to check how her day was to be a perfect friend and then I stopped looking after myself I started to over eat, I always had anxiety and my anxiety levels went up so much plus the stress of the job being self employed and driving around London a bike. At October 2021 a couple days before my birthday she came to visit me from countryside and i remember my friends telling me to stop that because both of us were completely attached to each other and that wasn’t healthy, wasn’t a real friendship with boundaries and everything because we were relying on each other for emotional support all the time, and as we were not a couple or having sex(which helps with the pillars for a relationship), the mental efforts to be there all time to give emotional support, to make her feel special and everything without sex was absolutely hard, I haven’t done sex because I didn’t want to hurt her or play with her feelings, but she felt played and used anyway. So at that day I had a major anxiety crisis and I said to her we need to part ways, what we are doing is not healthy, we are like a couple and this is making me confused, is confusing you and we need to part ways, that was my first heavy emotional drain in my mind, I cried lots, made her cry and everything and I was sure that time walk away was the best to do to both of us, cause it wasn’t healthy , but she was crying and said about rejection and everything and I felt sorry and I decided to stay with her and told all my friends to fuck off and then they all walked away cause they were tying to help me but I couldn’t see like that. So I went doctor started taking pills for anxiety Sertraline, because even I was stressed and and I thought the reason for it was my past trauma of being bullied in school my last 2 yrs which was severe bullied my self esteem was destroyed, they used to hurt me kicking and everything so was really bad, in the beginning of the bullying I was really strong with 17 yrs old, but then it was the whole class and stuffs and for 2 yrs was a hell studying at that school but I never said anything to my parents, but also coming from a religious family that struggled a lot financially and see many times parents arguments and created me a bit trauma of having relationships. So I took the pills and started to give less anxiety and for the other side I became extremely lazy and dismotivated.

2022 - I decided to start January going gym and look after myself to lose the 10 kgs I put on in myself and try to get my shit together again, so by march She went in a date kissed a guy and then went dating with him and then I thought they would start talking move on to a relationship or something, but instead She didn’t, and she came back to me all frustrated saying What have you done to me? And put some of shit in my face, and I will be honest at that time I was doing really well with money, gym lost the kilos and started to find ways to make more money or improve myself. But that day when she put all the shit on me I got so emotional drained again and gave up about everything as a weak man would do. I stopped going gym the emotional support I was giving was overwhelming and I never said to her it was cause I didn’t want to hurt. So but by April/ May 2022 I started to get my thinking worse, couldn’t reach my goals, couldn’t think straight and I was losing more myself in the emotional bond, I not going to lie I loved it because it gave me feelings i felt special because never had a relationship ship before, and with that I kept drinking Sertraline till 2023 July, by the time from 2022 January when I was 80 kgs, I end up with 108 kilos by September 2023, I absolutely lost myself in this, and when I started to get more weight I noticed myself in the mirror and I was feeling destroyed lower self esteem, and then I became fully dependent on her(may 2022), which should never happen. And I thought was because work stress but to compensate the mental effort I was overeating because everything I fought on goals and dreams was flying away.
Then a pattern of manipulation started from her side I don’t if she was scared of losing me or afraid or something, but everything I asked her like even small favours, or advices to buy stuffs for my place, since she is a woman she knows more about discounts quality’s and things. So I changed my bike with her help but with my money, bought couple things to my place with her advice and help with my money, but I always compensate her, taking to a nice meal, restaurant, sending money for coffee and things. And even doing this she started this pattern saying I was only friends for the things she could provide or give to me, but I was the one paying for everything and always trying to be thankful and compensate her. So in everything I asked like if she could help me I always compensate but it became a problem because always she used to put in my face when something happens between us, I said said several times I do care about you I appreciate your help and everything but you being hard, because it seems is because of you and not also my effort to work and buy things, and I mention so many times in the past 2 yrs the way she puts in my face is like affecting me like making me feel shit, totally different from someone else if they were going to help me. 

2023 - came and I was absolutely emotional attached and was difficult yr in everything in my life, I was lazy, taking big breaks to visit her in the countryside, lost in the goals and dreams, and I thought the problem was living in the big city and decided to move to the countryside next to her 15 Min close in Kent UK. I was so lost that I couldn’t also move on from my delivery job and everything.
So moved in Kent November 2023 and what is funny enough I sometimes have deep feelings and on December 23, we went TOB CAVERY to a roast dinner with her friends, and that day I felt absolutely cucco inside myself cause deep down I knew them before, but you know when you shouldn’t be there right? And I had the feeling I wouldn’t be in her life much longer, I panicked a bit and then forgot about it.

So 2024 - living in the countryside was good and I worked really hard my first months, so saved some 2 k in 4 months and was enjoying and a lot and then in April to May I started to be more friendly with my neighbour English girl, but nothing like sex or even relationship, just wanted to start making more friends and enjoy more the life in the country. She didn’t like much and to be honest started all again that emotions energy drain, in may I was so overwhelmed that I became desperate to go out the country for a 6 months break to try to get my shit together again, was absolutely hard, but then I didn’t tell her the truth and just told I wanted to go and find myself again, but her energy at the time was so much pressure that I stopped calling her all the caring names I used to call. 

So may was crazy, June a bit, but in July we travel for a week and then all were lovely again, then I got a job in a warehouse and I started to look after myself again going walks, 108 kilos September last year by December 2023 was 102, and by end of September 2024 was 95 kilos. I started to feel good again and then started to feel more sexually again since I have stopped Sertraline and as I lost weight started to feel the sex desire again and then where I fucked up on October, we had intimacy but then I didn’t fulfill her in what she wanted, she was upset and felt all rejected and everything and I know I shouldn’t have done or even tried because I just had a bit fun, but she always had hopes in having a relationship with me. So I said to her I couldn’t and told her would be better to her meet a man and start a relationship or something, and this times she listened to me went on a date had sex and then  days latter she was very different to me with the same questions again What is your problems with me and everything? I tried to explain I was a bit tired, but I was feeling emotional drained, I felt jealous as well to be honest and at that time when we were fine talking I saw a pattern of manipulation again, cause she was going date or a bit fun but using myself again as a emotional support and demanding words of affirmation, but at this time I was completely complete overwhelmed and dependent and I messaged her November 2024  we should walk away and stop this I don’t want to be manipulated, this is not right not ok, we have to stop seeing each other, going dinners, dog walk, coffee together and travel. 
And then we speak 5 days later when this happened and she said you are holding me back, that when I fully decided to let her go and also I said to her let me go. 

So couple weeks later beginning of December her daughter message me saying her mother is struggling with mental healthy and than I should Message her, because both of us can’t survive without each other. I replied saying we are still friends but I couldn’t be there anymore so I haven’t spoke to her since

December - 29/12/2024

I am in Belgium visiting my parents for holiday and I won’t lie since beginning of November when we stopped talking, I am feeling like shit, mentally drained, lost and all mixed feelings of hate sometimes, but I do know I really hurt her as well intentional and not intentional and I think she does think the same as well, but haven’t message her so far, sometimes I am reading articles about toxic here, or relation ship, friendship, situationship and I get desperate in the need of trying to message her and explain myself, but I know if I do it I will get myself lost all again, and if I eventually think in going back, the manipulation will be bigger and worse for me, since she already going having sex with people to find a relationship, don’t want to give emotional support like draining my energy. I want her to be happy and move on in her life and find someone who understands her and complete her, but I also think she still waiting my message cause I said I would
Message, but how can I message if am feeling so lost, confused, upset or allowing myself being manipulated intentional or not intentional? 

*****What would you guys do in my place, should stick with the no contact? I am not trying to punish anyone or trying to get her to message me first or anything like that, I am just doing this for myself, to get clarity, to see
My mistakes and improve them in a friendship or even in a relationship in the future, be a better human, trying to let it go these feeling of emotional drain, because I know if I eventually message I can say something that would hurt her more and sometimes being in silence is better. 

I still have her number and social media, I deleted my apps for the moment but also is not fair having to delete them to avoid to see her and everything after the hurt both of us caused to each other. I am am still absolutely lost, confused and trying to heal myself and in hope it doesn’t take longer than 6 months or something, but I know for the first time in my life coming back is not a option, also I don’t think we can be friends in the future as well? Cause it was bad for both sides and I don’t feel I could have a honest friendship after this, any advice???

I am coming back to the gym next week and will try to heal myself and it hurts so bad now things I did and what she did for me, but I will fine wherever it takes.  I just wanted to share
My history here and get advices and tell people when you meet the wrong woman or the wrong man is really fucked up.
 
Planning to start a new life as well in a new country in Europe when all this pain goes away.  And then be able to get a dog and work towards the goals again.


That was my first time writing here and I am sorry for the long text, I tried to explain the
Maximum I could. Also to mention I used to be much more normal before giving my whole energy that even going in a market for food shopping or coffee places or something I used to do became like a hard task having pânico attack because the place was too loud or busy. Therapy starts next week as well

1hovxpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1hovxpy/10_days_with_no_cream_in_my_coffee/,10 days with no cream in my coffee,"About 10 days ago I forgot to buy my usual half-n-half for my coffee.    
I am a die hard creamy coffee girl, and I drink it all day long, going through a quart of creamer each week.   
Because I had to wait until my next pay day to buy more cream, I was forced to drink my coffee black.   
The first day was very difficult, but by 3 days I was ok.  

Now, almost 2 weeks later, the depression and anxiety that I've experienced my ENTIRE LIFE is like, gone?  I feel unusually happy and I'm sleeping better and I'm more positive.   
I'm drinking the same amount of regular coffee, a pot a day, but the changes in my mood are crazy!  
I'm also less bloated, my face is thinner, I have fewer pimples, and I feel so much lighter.  

On top on all of that, my perimenopausal hot flashes have lessened!

It's amazing how one change can make such a huge difference.   
I've never considered myself lactose intolerant.  I've never gotten the diarrhea or the gas that is commonly associated with lactose intolerance.   But, I guess I must be?

  
I am just so thrilled at this change, it was so simple, and it's made a world of difference.   
I want to tell everybody!!!!!

I am in Belgium visiting my parents for holiday and I won’t lie since beginning of November when we stopped talking, I am feeling like shit, mentally drained, lost and all mixed feelings of hate sometimes, but I do know I really hurt her as well intentional and not intentional and I think she does think the same as well, but haven’t message her so far, sometimes I am reading articles about toxic here, or relation ship, friendship, situationship and I get desperate in the need of trying to message her and explain myself, but I know if I do it I will get myself lost all again, and if I eventually think in going back, the manipulation will be bigger and worse for me, since she already going having sex with people to find a relationship, don’t want to give emotional support like draining my energy. I want her to be happy and move on in her life and find someone who understands her and complete her, but I also think she still waiting my message cause I said I would
Message, but how can I message if am feeling so lost, confused, upset or allowing myself being manipulated intentional or not intentional? 

*****What would you guys do in my place, should stick with the no contact? I am not trying to punish anyone or trying to get her to message me first or anything like that, I am just doing this for myself, to get clarity, to see
My mistakes and improve them in a friendship or even in a relationship in the future, be a better human, trying to let it go these feeling of emotional drain, because I know if I eventually message I can say something that would hurt her more and sometimes being in silence is better. 

I still have her number and social media, I deleted my apps for the moment but also is not fair having to delete them to avoid to see her and everything after the hurt both of us caused to each other. I am am still absolutely lost, confused and trying to heal myself and in hope it doesn’t take longer than 6 months or something, but I know for the first time in my life coming back is not a option, also I don’t think we can be friends in the future as well? Cause it was bad for both sides and I don’t feel I could have a honest friendship after this, any advice???

I am coming back to the gym next week and will try to heal myself and it hurts so bad now things I did and what she did for me, but I will fine wherever it takes.  I just wanted to share
My history here and get advices and tell people when you meet the wrong woman or the wrong man is really fucked up.
 
Planning to start a new life as well in a new country in Europe when all this pain goes away.  And then be able to get a dog and work towards the goals again.


That was my first time writing here and I am sorry for the long text, I tried to explain the
Maximum I could. Also to mention I used to be much more normal before giving my whole energy that even going in a market for food shopping or coffee places or something I used to do became like a hard task having pânico attack because the place was too loud or busy. Therapy starts next week as well

Estou procurando formas de acessar uma versão antiga do site em que estava hospedado uma fanfic e arquivá-la. É uma fanfic do ship Shadamy (Shadow x Amy de Sonic) que li em 2018/2019 no site ""Nyah Fanfiction!"". Lembrei dela recentemente e quando tentei acessá-la, recebi uma mensagem que o autor a havia arquivado.   
  
Primeiro, tentei acessar o Wayback Machine para ver se alguém tinha arquivado a URL. Achei um archive de 2023 que mostrava a mensagem que que o autor a havia excluído. Já tentei procurar em vários outros sites de archive como o ArchiveToday, Google Cache, entre outros, mas não consegui achar nada.

As únicas coisas que tenho são o nome da história, um trechinho da sinopse que aparece quando a pesquiso no google e um link para o segundo capítulo que não pode mais ser acessado.

  
Já tentei procurar por backups da página no cloudflare, mas não consegui

Uma coisa que não faz muito sentido é que na versão antiga do site no Wayback machine e no google, diz que a história foi excluída, mas quando acesso o site agora (PlusFiction - é o sucessor do Nyah), aparece que a história foi arquivada, não exluída. 

  
Também não consigo entrar em contato com o autor, pois o usuário dele não está mais visível no site e infelizmente, não me lembro qual era.

Será que alguém poderia me ajudar nessa busca, por favor? É uma história muito importante para mim e gostaria de poder lê-la só mais uma vez.

For context we're together for 1.5 years. I started dating him less than 6 months after my divorce with my ex-husband, where we were married for 10 years, and while he (my ex-husband) always said he was bi, he never acted on it. We had a great sex life and an amazing bond so it was a shock when he told me in 2022 that he thinks he's fully gay and was in-love with another man. I was broken, but we've remained good friends through it all.

Now onto my new boyfriend who i started dating in April 2023.

He's very loving, sweet, considerate. He prioritizes me, shows that he wants to spend time with me. He's introduced me to his kids and has taught them to be very accommodating and accepting to me. He listens to me and he's a good lover.

So back to the present, I’ve been struggling with my relationship lately, and I’d love to hear some outside perspectives. Am I being a bad girlfriend, or is my boyfriend being unreasonable? Here's the situation:

1. **Controlling Behavior** I live in Zone 2 (London), and he lives 1.5 hours away in a village. He insists I spend every weekend at his place. If I want to see my friends on a Saturday, he gets upset and demands I visit him instead. Even when I say I’ll come on Saturday morning, he pushes for Friday night. Lately, he’s been asking me to come on Thursday and work from his place on Friday. I’ve tried, but I hate working there—it’s uncomfortable, with a tiny desk and no proper setup. He says it's because he loves me he wants to spend as much time as he can with me. However, while he can come to my place, he often has to stay near his kids so him coming to me happens maybe once every 6 weeks. My biggest issue with this is that, I'm in London. I moved here 6 years ago. I want to enjoy the city and I can't really during the week due to work. My friends are always doing so many fun things on weekends and I feel so much FOMO. It would be great if he lived somewhere fun or we did things on weekends. But his village has like 700 ppl, not even a grocery nearby, it's nice for walks, but boring for everything else. Additionally, when I'm over at his on weekends, he involves me in so many cleaning and chores. I absolutely hate it sometimes.
2. **Insecurity with Male Friends** He says he’s fine with me having male friends, but if I go out with my best guy friend, he always calls me while I’m out and keeps me on the phone for ages. It’s exhausting, and he never does this when I’m with female friends or in a group. If I don't answer he keeps calling, one night my phone was in my purse on silent and i saw 33 missed calls.
3. **Issues with My Ex-Husband** I’ve always been upfront about being friends with my ex-husband. We were married for 10 years (together even longer), and our divorce was amicable. Last Christmas, I got my ex a small gift—a Stranger Things coffee mug and book (his favorite show)—and I didn’t mention it to my boyfriend. A few days later, we were going through photos on my phone, and he saw a pic of gift. I didn't lie, i said I got it for my ex. He went ballistic, accusing me of cheating and still loving my ex. I told him it was something I got months ago and that my ex is a friend now. Despite me being honest about wanting a friendly relationship with my ex, he said I needed better boundaries and called it disrespectful. This has now caused me to lie and hide when I do talk to my ex because I fear he'll explode on me.
4. **Financial Concerns** Despite claiming he’s financially secure, I’ve paid for nearly every date and trip (over £7000) we've done in the last 18 months. He says he’ll pay me back once he clears his credit cards, but it hasn’t happened. He’s asked me to lend him £500 multiple times in the past few months. I suspect he’s struggling financially due to his big mortgage (£3000/month) and child support.
5. **Kids and Family Goals** His kids are great, and I’ve bonded with his daughter, but I struggle with feeling like a potential stepmom. Their mother is very involved, and I have no real say in their lives. It makes me yearn for my own family, but he’s had a vasectomy and says my eggs are “too old.” He’s suggested I can adopt if a reversal doesn’t work, but I’m unsure if that’s what I want.
6. **Lifestyle Differences** I can’t imagine living in his village. He refuses to consider moving because of the kids’ schools and instead tries to convince me how much better the countryside is. I love the city, and it feels like there’s no room for compromise.

I feel like I’m constantly compromising, losing parts of myself to make this relationship work. Am I being unfair, or is he asking too much of me?",5,1735478365.0,Advice,17,1.0,False

I was using a Timemore C3 till now and I love it and will now use it when I travel. With DF64, my mornings should be a bit more pleasant, as I don’t have to hand grind my coffee daily anymore 😁

Delivery details: Ordered it from df64coffee.com on 24th late night with normal shipping, got FedEx tracking link on 26th, on 28th it reached the Airport in my city (in India), cleared customs and is delivered on the same day (28th).

What I paid: Rs. 33.93K for the Grinder+shipping (used 10% discount code), Rs. 339 DCC fee on CC, Rs 2.9K Duty (the seller told they will refund some of this), Rs. 800 FedEx Advancement charge. 

I was kinda stressed initially regarding the shipping, tracking, duty, etc., but ultimately it was all pretty smooth and fast!

1hovu6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hovu6p/im_a_retired_english_teacher_and_reading_online/,"I'm a retired English teacher, and reading online stories used to be my favourite hobby. But now I need a new hobby.
","Bringing my evening stroll to an end due to a sudden haze of rain, I turned the corner into my street.

She was waiting for me, right outside my front yard. I thought it was a new neighbour dropping round to complain about something. Something about her tense stance made me realise that she was not good news.

Her eyes widened when she saw me. “*You’re* Adder\_at\_Night999?”

I frowned. “How do you know my reddit username?”

She shook her head. “It doesn’t matter- listen- I’m not here to hurt you-“

*What?* I looked around- my street set in a greater London borough that still has a quaint village feel and it was quiet and empty in the early wet evening lull.

She was still talking “-I just want to know why. I just came to talk to you- Why do you always downvote my stories? Everyone loves my stories- everyone- you know that – *you know that*! but you always downvote them- you’re always the first downvote, sometimes the only one - I just had to know why-“ She was babbling at me in a strong accent I can only describe as “typical American”.

“Please- let’s go to a coffee shop and talk- I came a long way to visit you, just to know why-, to understand- “ She reached out and gripped my sleeve.

I stood stock still. None of the few people I know in real life know my reddit account, or my fondness for the scary stories that people post on Reddit. I stared at the middle-aged woman confronting me. She was wearing a glossy new-looking cream-colored mac and very bright lipstick, very unsuitable for her age.

Her other hand moved in her pocket. In an instant, the fright that had been gathering since she said my Reddit username broke over me like a splash of cold water from a bucket. I ripped my hand loose, turned and ran to my front door, frantically scrabbling for my keys.

She followed me, reached out, opened the door that was already unlocked, and pushed me in. I am not a large strong woman, simply a retired Eng Lit teacher with a weakness for Reddit, and no match for this agitated American Redditor.  

We both stood in the dark hallway, her back to the front door. Hands slippery from sweat, I tried to pull out my mobile.

She repeated “I only want to talk to you. Please. I know you have time- you spend all your time on Reddit!” Her voice rose slightly, now audibly tinged with madness.

She must have heard it too. She gulped hard, and then said calmly “Aren’t you going to offer me a cup of tea? That’s what you British folk do, right? I travelled a long way to see you! Where’s those famous British manners?” She aimed for a jokey tone.

 “Let me put the kettle on” I said mechanically.

Her hand moved in her pocket again.  “Okay”.

I went to the kitchen, filled the kettle and turned it on. She stood in the doorway, watching me get out two mugs.

“I’m not here to hurt you” she repeated. I nodded, staring at the kettle. 

“It’s just, I had to find out who you were, why you downvote my stories. You don’t look anything like I imagined- I thought you were some neckbeard basement troll and you were downvoting me because most my stories are about women’s issues. But then I did some digging, and found out- you’re just an old woman, just a few years older than me- that kinda makes it worse - don’t you have any female solidarity? I just had to come and speak to you, see what the problem was-”

The kettle was still cold and silent.

“It doesn’t work like that, you know” I said cautiously, willing the kettle to boil.

“And you have this nice place”, she said, looking around appreciatively “Looks like a house right from Midsomer Murders!” The jokey tone again. The kettle began making very tiny noises.

“What’s your Reddit name?” I asked, hoping I sounded friendly.

“Oh come on hun, you must know me. I’m WitchSea1994!” She said it quite proudly.

I remembered her stories. It was beyond me how anyone could upvote her cliché jumble of gory fantasy. But there was no doubt she was very popular. I nodded. “I quite like your stories” I said. The noises from the kettle were becoming a tiny bit louder.

She frowned. “Then why do you always downvote them?” she snapped, and took a step towards me. *""Always!""*

I took a step back. The kettle was now boiling. “I don’t always downvote them” I muttered.

Her eyes sparked. “Every one! Every single one, you downvote. And you’re often the first. I monitor all my stories- I chart the upvotes and downvotes in excel- and you’re always dragging me down! I even know you make fake accounts just to downvote stories!!” she was howling now, and she lunged towards me.

I grabbed the kettle and splashed the boiling water right into her distorted face. She screamed in agony, and I was able to push past, run through the open door into the street, dialling 999. I have never felt so comforted by hearing the sirens and then seeing the blue flashing lights only moments later.

I haven’t been on Reddit since. But I know I need a new hobby, one that doesn't involve cyberspace and scary stories as much.

I fucked up, we were together for a bit over 2 years, we were planning on getting a house together after basically already living together. I have had issues in my past about people leaving me, when I was a teenager my mum packed her bags and left. I was then basically left homeless.

During the planning of getting a house with my girlfriend at the time, I started to panic. The whole relationship was going great, we barely ever argued or anything like that. When we were planning/ looking at houses I started to go out drinking a lot and one night I got black out drunk and kissed someone else. I barely remember it but when I had confirmation that it happened, I took a few days to process and then told her. I broke up with her and told her that I wasn't able to provide her with what she wanted right now and basically didn't deserve her.

It was hard, but I know it was the right decision to tell her and let her move on with her life. We broke up a bit over 3 months ago. During this process she would regularly call me when she was upset and I would do my best to help her in any way I could, wether it would be staying up with her all night and cuddling her and saying I'm sorry or sending her food packages to make sure she's eating. I was genuinely trying to change for her and was trying to show her this. I basically cut out all drinking and other bad habits and have been working on my self mentally and physically.

Things seemed to be in a weird limbo state for the past few months, one week/day it would be very upsetting and I would be consoling her and trying to help her heal, the next we seemed like we were starting to progress and we're laughing and cuddling again.

When things were bad, I would get messages like ""I look good don't I, bet you wish you never cheated"", or she would randomly tell me how she's planning a holiday and can't wait to talk to guys with ""attractive accents"", or how she went out and an older guy bought her a bottle of Prosecco so she pecked him. I told her I didn't want to hear those things but it would always be the same response, ""but you made the mistake"".

And although it hurt to hear those things, I felt like I had to accept and listen to it cause she was right, and I had to punish myself for it. I have no issue with her wanting to move on, but I just didn't want to hear about all of her exploits.

To be completely honest, towards the end of these last 3 months, she was coming round and we were cuddling, being intimate, she was asking me if I was speaking to anyone else, she was saying she missed me etc... we agreed to go for coffee and have a proper catch up, I thought we were steering towards the right direction. We were calling each other nicely, checking up on each other etc…

Then suddenly, I don't hear from her. I tried reaching out and eventually I got a phone call from her saying that ""it's just a friendly thing and that she's sorry for messing me around towards the end"". I don't have an issue if she's moved on, I want the best for her. I then find out that she's dating someone new, they started dating within a week/ a few days after our last time meeting and being intimate (it was after this time that we agreed to go for a coffee). I found out through a friend and messaged her saying that I know, and that I would be removing her from social media but she has my number if she needs me.

She then calls me straight after I sent that message asking if I'm ok. She asks what we’re going to do going forward about social media and if we should remove each other. I say it’s for the best, cause I would hate to be the guy that was dating a girl that was still in contact with her ex. She then says “but I wouldn’t be posting him for a few months anyway” I obviously say that's it's not great to hear but she has to do what's best for her. We then talk for an hour and a half on the phone, she’s telling me how nice this new guy is, she told me that he’s willing to wait for her to be ready for a relationship. She then tells me it’s just “casual and seeing where things go”. She then tells me how she’s already met his brother, is going to his birthday party, and has been invited to meet his parents. They’ve only been dating for 2 weeks, she then reiterates that it’s just “casual and it might not even work out” but she “can’t say no to free food” whilst telling me about where they’re going for their next date. 

We agree to then not keep in contact, but we also agree that we will have to be in touch at some point in the future because it’s our mutual friends birthday soon and we should make sure that we’re both comfortable with each other going. I then don’t hear from her for a few days, then I wake up to a “happy Christmas” message from her, so I reply with “merry Christmas, wishing you the best and hope your doing well, take care :)🎄” and I haven’t her from her since.

I’m sorry for the LONG message but I’ve just been really struggling to process my emotions. I understand that if I didn’t kiss someone else, then none of this would’ve happened. But I also don’t condone how she’s been acting after if it ended. just want to state again, if she wants to move on and be happy with someone else then that’s fine. I just feel like I was used as a stop gap until she was either fully over me or had someone else lined up. It’s probably selfish to think of it like that but it’s just how I feel.

I.

My biggest sin is:

I'm a fool.

A fool,

A foolish fool.

No matter what I think and dream

and if I ever self redeem,

the truth's almost full to the brim,

II.

My greatest secret:

In my chest,

hidden in greyish cloud,

the cloud of smoke from cigarettes

and vanilla cigars.

The proof is above my left breast

and in my bitter pills.

I brought this curse upon myself

or that is how it feels.

My secret smells like red wine stains,

it smells like vodka breath.

I'm not afraid of loneliness,

I'm not afraid of death.

The secret sounds like diesel engine,

like loud music at 3 AM.

It sounds like crowded busy hall,

I fear you finding who I am.

My secret tastes like late night candy,

black coffee in the morning,

energy drinks at midnight

with an aftertaste like taurine.

It feels like undesired touch,

it feels surreal, like fever dream.

Like needle piercing back of hand,

like blade finding its way through skin.

Like velvet fur that's out of reach,

like asking God for one more day.

Wondering if I'll have her back,

like deciding that I just may.

It feels like being lost at sea,

like losing my mind constantly,

like having hard time to just be,

like forgetting the real me.

And I'm not scared of dying soon,

or feeling pain, or being hurt.

I have hard time to understand,

I struggle to be understood.

There's only one kind of hurting

that feels unbearable:

it's giving love to others

while being unlovable.

I hope you'll keep it to yourself,

don't include it in my epitaph.

1hovqbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMOPAWS/comments/1hovqbt/16_months_and_counting/,16 months and counting ,"Hi everyone 

Thank
You for setting up this sub. It’s been a huge help to me as for the first 6 month I didn’t know what was happening to me. 

I have been in this for 16 months. I was on retention for 6 months prior, I felt amazing. All the benefits, people saying how good I looked, female attraction, higher confidence, felt unstoppable etc tec insane workouts and just feeling 100% at all times. Running nearly 40 km per week uphill. 

The first month of paws I could barely walk. I cried all day long and would shuffle from couch to bed. 
Couldn’t lift any weights, not even 3kg dumbbells, couldn’t run, couldn’t walk, stopped walking my dog, had to take time off work, 
After that month the suicidal depression hit, 
That lasted months, I would
Need to take painkillers some days it got so bad. I am a non drinker and some days I had to have a glass of wine to dull the pain. I cried and cried all day long. 
I went though a bad breakup about a month before I hit paws. I knew it needed to end and I was fine about it. I was experiencing high level magnetism and work outs so I knew I could cope. That all changed.

I would come out of paws briefly after 5 months for a day of so, and then I would run in the forest, but I would be back in paws the next day, people here talk about doing TRE and yoga. My body was too aching and stiff to do either. I could barely walk. The Brain fog was so extreme I could barely work. My colleagues were telling me to get blood tests, manager was getting very frustrated with me as I went from a great worker to a complete dead weight. My diet went to shit. I went from a high end diet to eating complete crap. Depression food. 

I kept looking for answers. On the SR sub I learned about flatlines and some herbs that might help, I bought them all. They did not cure the flatline but they cured other things. 
I experienced how quickly people abandoned me when I was in a flatline, most people abandoned me.

It hurt, however i developed extremely high confidence even though I had low confidence. I hated myself but my confidence in my ability to stick up for myself increased Massively. Eg a guy said something on the street one day that I didn’t like. I let it go but I knew I wouldn’t let it go again.He said it again the next week. I immediately turned around and approached him, he apologised. This was new for me. I had developed a masculine frame in this flatline. I was drowning in grief but at the same time, luck was on my side. My confidence with women was extreme, I said whatever I wanted to say and my nervous system was entirely calm. All
While
In a devastating flatline. I could see the healing. Sometimes I would get relief for a week and think it’s over. It wasn’t . After about 6 months could finally lift weights again. So weeks I still couldn’t but that was a huge win for me. Some weeks I would run 6 km and crash back into flatline . I love to run, it’s been hard. I love yoga, but I would only do old peoples yoga at the weekend with 70 year olds. 
I’m still in this. I have grown very close to god in this. Something I don’t see mentioned at all here.
I have healed deeply. I see the whole world differently. I see that people are lost in greed and ignorance and they will abandon you fast. I have found the ones I can trust.


It has been hell. But my old life was worse. Financially I have made gains, which is bizarre as I can’t really work to the level I used to. 
Women seem
To like me more, even if flatline, because I ignore them mostly, some people hate me. They try to show it until they realise they are picking a fight with someone that will fight to the death. I will fight to the death. The veil has been lifted from my eyes. I used to people please and want peace and connection, now I feel like a stoic warrior. Cross me and I will calmly deal with you. I don’t care if you can beat me, we are throwing down. I don’t care how powerful you think you are I am not backing down. 

So it’s like watching yourself heal while being crippled by trauma, 

I have recently been able to do TRE, my body ached too much before. I started TRE in the 14th month. I would do patches of yoga in between but the flatline always came back with a vengeance. 

This is the hardest thing I have ever experienced. But the change in perspective, personality, willpower is worth it. I feel like I don’t need anyone. I feel completely whole as a person. I feel deeply connected to God. Honestly I look around and I don’t see many people I respect. Even those much older than me. I can see through those without honour. 

It seems like my flatline was worse than most. Not the worst. I read about a guy hallucinating but I read most people can exercise in flatline. I couldn’t, my body ached so much, I could feel all my trapped energy. 
I had a kundalini awakening years ago so maybe that’s why my flatline is different,.

I also got really sick really easily ij flatline but healed without medication 

Things that helped me are
Maca root 
Tongkat Ali
Creatine 
Fish oils 
Coffee - I avoid this but I needed it 
Rhodiola rosea 
Shilajit 

These helped a little, but honestly.. nothing stops a flatline.. I’m not even sure if TRE does.. I might just be coming out or a flatline naturally. 

I notice some days after TRE I am deep in flatline and some days I am feeling great after TRE. So that’s not consistent, I do wonder if it’s TRE or just flatline lifting gradually. 

Also no one mentions the energy body here. The chi or prana, flatline isn’t just the nervous system healing, our whole aura is cleansing and the chi in our body is breaking through Blocks, chakras are healing too. 

If you don’t feel amazing after this then unfortunately you may have more work to do. I felt I had to do deep inner work in this time, really confront myself. 
I cried everyday for 14 months. Recently I cry maybe once a week so the flatline is definitely lifting. This is why I am not so sure about the TRE being the way out. It definitely can’t hurt and I would recommend it. Just don’t rely on anything to get you out fast. I might be in this another 6 months but having a day or relief here and there is like heaven. These days I sit on the couch all day and I can tell you, just having a break from brain fog is heaven. I couldn’t even follow tv shows. Some days I could read, I didn’t have the energy to Type this Reddit post until now. I couldn’t clean my home. Showering was a challenge. Brushing my teeth was a challenge. Brain fog was so bad I wouldn’t text people back. There are attractive women that I haven’t text back for weeks. I just have severe anhedonia. 

Maybe my flatline was worse than others. I feel like it has made me so much stronger. I’m not out of this yet. But it’s better than it was. Slowly getting relief. Still can barely walk some days. So it’s not over by a long shot yet. 

I didn’t think my addiction was bad, but obviously it was. Or may my child hood trauma was just bad. I don’t know. I was definitely using pmo eveyday for a few years. I definitely was addicted to sex with women. Anyway, no going back now.

1hovq1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1hovq1t/was_i_just_kept_around_until_she_was_fully_over/,"Was I just kept around until she was fully over me, or is it some kind of revenge?","Gonna be completely honest from the get go. I fucked up, we were together for a bit over 2 years, we were planning on getting a house together after basically already living together. I have had issues in my past about people leaving me, when I was a teenager my mum packed her bags and left. I was then basically left homeless.

During the planning of getting a house with my girlfriend at the time, I started to panic. The whole relationship was going great, we barely ever argued or anything like that. When we were planning/ looking at houses I started to go out drinking a lot and one night I got black out drunk and kissed someone else. I barely remember it but when I had confirmation that it happened, I took a few days to process and then told her. I broke up with her and told her that I wasn't able to provide her with what she wanted right now and basically didn't deserve her.

It was hard, but I know it was the right decision to tell her and let her move on with her life. We broke up a bit over 3 months ago. During this process she would regularly call me when she was upset and I would do my best to help her in any way I could, wether it would be staying up with her all night and cuddling her and saying I'm sorry or sending her food packages to make sure she's eating. I was genuinely trying to change for her and was trying to show her this. I basically cut out all drinking and other bad habits and have been working on my self mentally and physically.

Things seemed to be in a weird limbo state for the past few months, one week/day it would be very upsetting and I would be consoling her and trying to help her heal, the next we seemed like we were starting to progress and we're laughing and cuddling again.

When things were bad, I would get messages like ""I look good don't I, bet you wish you never cheated"", or she would randomly tell me how she's planning a holiday and can't wait to talk to guys with ""attractive accents"", or how she went out and an older guy bought her a bottle of Prosecco so she pecked him. I told her I didn't want to hear those things but it would always be the same response, ""but you made the mistake"".

And although it hurt to hear those things, I felt like I had to accept and listen to it cause she was right, and I had to punish myself for it. I have no issue with her wanting to move on, but I just didn't want to hear about all of her exploits.

To be completely honest, towards the end of these last 3 months, she was coming round and we were cuddling, being intimate, she was asking me if I was speaking to anyone else, she was saying she missed me etc... we agreed to go for coffee and have a proper catch up, I thought we were steering towards the right direction. We were calling each other nicely, checking up on each other etc…

Then suddenly, I don't hear from her. I tried reaching out and eventually I got a phone call from her saying that ""it's just a friendly thing and that she's sorry for messing me around towards the end"". I don't have an issue if she's moved on, I want the best for her. I then find out that she's dating someone new, they started dating within a week/ a few days after our last time meeting and being intimate (it was after this time that we agreed to go for a coffee). I found out through a friend and messaged her saying that I know, and that I would be removing her from social media but she has my number if she needs me.

She then calls me straight after I sent that message asking if I'm ok. She asks what we’re going to do going forward about social media and if we should remove each other. I say it’s for the best, cause I would hate to be the guy that was dating a girl that was still in contact with her ex. She then says “but I wouldn’t be posting him for a few months anyway” I obviously say that's it's not great to hear but she has to do what's best for her. We then talk for an hour and a half on the phone, she’s telling me how nice this new guy is, she told me that he’s willing to wait for her to be ready for a relationship. She then tells me it’s just “casual and seeing where things go”. She then tells me how she’s already met his brother, is going to his birthday party, and has been invited to meet his parents. They’ve only been dating for 2 weeks, she then reiterates that it’s just “casual and it might not even work out” but she “can’t say no to free food” whilst telling me about where they’re going for their next date. 

We agree to then not keep in contact, but we also agree that we will have to be in touch at some point in the future because it’s our mutual friends birthday soon and we should make sure that we’re both comfortable with each other going. I then don’t hear from her for a few days, then I wake up to a “happy Christmas” message from her, so I reply with “merry Christmas, wishing you the best and hope your doing well, take care :)🎄” and I haven’t her from her since.

I’m sorry for the LONG message but I’ve just been really struggling to process my emotions. I understand that if I didn’t kiss someone else, then none of this would’ve happened. But I also don’t condone how she’s been acting after if it ended. just want to state again, if she wants to move on and be happy with someone else then that’s fine. I just feel like I was used as a stop gap until she was either fully over me or had someone else lined up. It’s probably selfish to think of it like that but it’s just how I feel. After months of trying to make things work, I just feel like I’m back at the start again.

1hovpux,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1hovpux/kind_mil_with_zero_boundaries_and_anxiety/,Kind MIL with zero boundaries and anxiety ,"I'll start by saying my MIL is a very kind woman and we have always got along well. She is a worrier by nature, which I knew, but has been made worse by the arrival of her first grandson (my baby boy) four months ago. 

It started at the very beginning. She would come to visit and try to stay for hours and hours until my husband would encourage her to leave when it was obvious i was struggling 

She takes the baby from me and never ever asks. Like there has been no occasion I have seen her that she hasn't lifted the baby from my arms almost immediately upon seeing me. 

She always finds a way to take him out of my sight. When we are in her house, she picks him up and brings him to her room. If she is in our house, she says she's taking him for a walk around and will go to the kitchen or living room, whichever room we aren't in. On a walk with my husband and I, she waited outside with the pram while we got coffees and when we came out she was gone and had taken him up the street.

She calls my husband every day to ask how the baby slept through the night. She tells me every time I see her that she stays awake worrying about the stairs in our house she told my sister that she thinks we don't carry the baby right when going up and down. She quizzes me on when I will manage to put him down awake, has he has a dirty diaper that day etc. 

We have routinely asked her not to kiss him as she suffers from cold sores and obviously just don't want people outside of us kissing him, but she says things like 'oh I can't sneak a kiss from you today because Mam and Dad are looking.'

She has also started this new things where she makes passive aggressive comments about my mother to the baby 'i know this isn't as good as what Nana X does but you don't mind.' My mother  does nothing out of the ordinary but baby tends to react better to her because she follows my lead rather than forcing the him to be picked up carried around etc.

I know all of this comes from a place of love but I am so irritated by it all and already dealing with postpartum anxiety, and it really is the driving cause at this point. My husband laughs it off and says she just loves him so much and this is just the way she is, so I have found myself laughing it off too despite feeling like I could cry at times. 

Any advice on how I could begin to approach it? Speaking directly to her doesn't seem like an option, and my husband just doesn't seem to get it. ",5,1735477828.0,JUSTNOMIL,7,1.0,False
1hovpmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hovpmg/in_love_with_fwb_m28_and_reaching_my_f30/,"In love with FWB (M28) and reaching my (F30) heartbreak limit, any advice to fall out of love while staying friends? ","TDLR.: Felt in love with my FWB of 2 years, we behave as a couple but he only sees me as a friend. How do I keep him in my life without becoming obliterated by the heartache of seeing him falling in love with somebody else?

This is a throwaway account as my main has some identifiable information and my friend is on reddit.

I'm truly desperate about my situation and in great need of advice. I met my FWB two years ago through an app. At the time he was seeing another girl (non-exclusively), but they broke up more or less a month after we met for unrelated reasons. Since then, we have both been single and dating around. I feel it is important to note he is non-monagomous. I am kind of undecided on the subject (really agree with the lifestyle but doubt my insecurities can handle it).

We have become great friends, we do a lot of activities together: we play board games, we roller-skate, we go to the theater/cinema, we go bowling, we meet to discover cute coffee places and sit and read... I absolutely love the things we do together. I have met his friends, he has met mine. We even traveled together this summer.

We share a lot of intimacy together, further than sex, which is also great (we have a lot of lust for each other). I sleep with my head on his chest at least 2 times per week.

I adore his dark humour. I love the excitement he feels about everything. I love his mind, his ideas, the passion he feels for his projects. I love his kindness, his openness and his desire to improve and grow.

We have a great dynamic, I feel he truly gets and sees me. We have developed so many little routines and inside jokes over the last 2 years. We have helped each other grow a lot and really support each other when in need. We have told ""I love you"" to each other many, many times. We often talk about how important our bond is for each other and how grateful we are for our friendship.

I'm sooo madly in love with this person. Sometimes I even forget we are not in a relationship because we basically behave as if we were in one. But he just isn't in love with me. We have never talked about it, but he's told me in so many ways.

He always tells me how much he loves me as a friend, how glad he is to have a friend like me, how he won't toss me aside when he'll be in a relationship... my heart is broken everytime. He has even told me a couple of times how our friendship has become the standard for what he wants in a relationship. He wants everything he has with me, he just doesn't want ME.

I'm really struggling here. I love him, I want him to be happy. I know how important our friendship is for him (it's as important for me) and I don't want to end it, but lately I've become very scared at the thought of him falling in love with somebody else, and how it will break my heart in a way I'm not prepared for. He has recently started seeing again the girl he was dating when we first met. She's apparently told him she's falling in love with him, and I am spiraling. I know there's a big chance he will fall in love with her and start a relationship.

I don't know what to do. I'm thinking I may need some distance to get over my feelings, but I don't know if time will make them go away, nor am I sure I will really be able to not see him. I really, really want to keep this person in my life.

Anyone who has been in a similar situation, I would love some insight: Do I go NC? Do I take some time off? Is it possible to get over this while maintaining our current dynamic (minus the sex)? How do I speak to him about this?

I'm really thankful to anyone who responds to this post. I know I'm an idiot to have gotten to this place, but now I'm here and I'm lost.",4,1735477805.0,relationship_advice,25,1.0,False

Title: ""Alaska to DC""

Teaser:

Scene: A dark, abandoned warehouse in Washington, D.C. The camera pans over discarded tools and signs of a struggle. A phone rings in the background, unanswered. Cut to a serene Alaskan wilderness where Gibbs (Mark Harmon) is in his cabin, working on a piece of wood with his knife. His phone vibrates, breaking the silence.

Act One:

Back in D.C., the NCIS team is in full swing. McGee (Sean Murray) and Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) are analyzing the last known location of Agent Alden Parker (Gary Cole), who's been missing for three days. Kasie (Diona Reasonover) is running tests on items found at the scene, hinting at a possible kidnapping. 
In Alaska, Gibbs answers his phone to hear Director Vance's (Rocky Carroll) voice, tense and urgent. ""Gibbs, we need you back. Parker's in trouble.""
Gibbs' plane ride back is tense, filled with flashbacks of his past with Parker, showing their respect and occasional clash of personalities.

Act Two:

Arrival in D.C.: Gibbs steps back into the NCIS office, his presence immediately steadying the team. He's briefed on the situation; Parker was last seen investigating a case involving a high-profile arms dealer.
Investigation: Gibbs, with his seasoned intuition, reexamines the evidence. He notices something others missed - a piece of fabric from Parker's jacket caught on a fence, leading them to a new location.
Interrogation: The team tracks down a suspect, a known associate of the arms dealer. Gibbs, with his no-nonsense approach, gets the location where Parker might be held.

Act Three:

Rescue Mission: Gibbs, Torres, and McGee gear up for a nighttime raid on an old factory. They move with precision, Gibbs leading, his experience evident in every move.
Showdown: They find Parker, alive but injured. A brief but intense shootout occurs, and Gibbs, with his signature head slap, ensures Parker's safety, but not before they deal with the captors.
Aftermath: Back at NCIS, Parker receives medical attention, and there's a moment of relief among the team. Gibbs, however, remains stoic, his concern subtly shown through his actions rather than words.

Tag:

Gibbs and Parker: In a quiet moment, Parker thanks Gibbs for coming back. Gibbs, with a slight nod, replies, ""You'd do the same for me."" 
Gibbs' Departure: As morning light filters through the office windows, Gibbs prepares to leave, but not before sharing a coffee moment with McGee. Gibbs hints at returning to Alaska but leaves the door open for future involvement.
Closing Shot: Gibbs on a plane back to Alaska, looking out the window, the city disappearing beneath him, but his mind clearly still with his team.

End Credits Roll.

This episode would blend the action, drama, and character development that fans of NCIS appreciate, with Gibbs' return adding a significant layer of nostalgia and depth to the storyline.",0,1735477405.0,NCIS,0,0.5,False

I came to the UK August 2020 with 26 yrs old to live in London, started working as a delivery driver due some of the lockdown restrictions and lack of jobs, and was having a great time in my life financially and enjoying sightseeing, but as I was young never had a relationship before as I was focusing on saving some money to come to Europe since my family comes from Italy and I wanted to be close to Italian culture again. I had some casual sex, and I had with 4 to 5 people before nothing long, and then one day I met an woman at the time she was 38 or 39 yrs old coming from a break up relationship after being married for 20 yrs, her ex at the time became gay. I had about couple times sex with her like for fun and enjoying because I didn’t do much it before and I was having fun but deep down I knew we were not made to be couple, but the same time both of us enjoyed the attention we were giving to each other, I come from a family where we call people, lovely, angel, nice, hugs, kisses in the cheek, probably a bit different from the English Culture. There was a day she asked me if we were a couple and I said No we are not we just enjoying each other, but also I don’t know how to explain or maybe I wasn’t very direct at the time I was feeling a different energy like a heavy energy I would say for both sides and I said to her I couldn’t do more casual sex to her or anyone cause the energy I got was overwhelming and I said I can be friends if you want I will stop casual sex. She said we could be friends but at the time I knew that wasn’t correct as well because could be confusing for both, and I think even when I was lonely I still at that time could have control of my thoughts, goals and dreams. So by 2021 when we stopped sex she went for dating but nothing serious happened for her and then our friendship became strong, because we were talking to each other everyday and having fun, I used to sing on the phone, laugh lots like talk my politics shit, talking about travelling, dreams, goals and everything I always have been free spirit.  So was a strong bond or connection as you can say.
By the time 2021 like September, October some of my friends started telling me - look it seems you guys are in a relationship instead of a friendship, everything you do is like what a couple do, this is not healthy for you and not healthy for her, and the time by I need to give more and more my energy to check how her day was to be a perfect friend and then I stopped looking after myself I started to over eat, I always had anxiety and my anxiety levels went up so much plus the stress of the job being self employed and driving around London a bike. At October 2021 a couple days before my birthday she came to visit me from countryside and i remember my friends telling me to stop that because both of us were completely attached to each other and that wasn’t healthy, wasn’t a real friendship with boundaries and everything because we were relying on each other for emotional support all the time, and as we were not a couple or having sex(which helps with the pillars for a relationship), the mental efforts to be there all time to give emotional support, to make her feel special and everything without sex was absolutely hard, I haven’t done sex because I didn’t want to hurt her or play with her feelings, but she felt played and used anyway. So at that day I had a major anxiety crisis and I said to her we need to part ways, what we are doing is not healthy, we are like a couple and this is making me confused, is confusing you and we need to part ways, that was my first heavy emotional drain in my mind, I cried lots, made her cry and everything and I was sure that time walk away was the best to do to both of us, cause it wasn’t healthy , but she was crying and said about rejection and everything and I felt sorry and I decided to stay with her and told all my friends to fuck off and then they all walked away cause they were tying to help me but I couldn’t see like that. So I went doctor started taking pills for anxiety Sertraline, because even I was stressed and and I thought the reason for it was my past trauma of being bullied in school my last 2 yrs which was severe bullied my self esteem was destroyed, they used to hurt me kicking and everything so was really bad, in the beginning of the bullying I was really strong with 17 yrs old, but then it was the whole class and stuffs and for 2 yrs was a hell studying at that school but I never said anything to my parents, but also coming from a religious family that struggled a lot financially and see many times parents arguments and created me a bit trauma of having relationships. So I took the pills and started to give less anxiety and for the other side I became extremely lazy and dismotivated.

2022 - I decided to start January going gym and look after myself to lose the 10 kgs I put on in myself and try to get my shit together again, so by march She went in a date kissed a guy and then went dating with him and then I thought they would start talking move on to a relationship or something, but instead She didn’t, and she came back to me all frustrated saying What have you done to me? And put some of shit in my face, and I will be honest at that time I was doing really well with money, gym lost the kilos and started to find ways to make more money or improve myself. But that day when she put all the shit on me I got so emotional drained again and gave up about everything as a weak man would do. I stopped going gym the emotional support I was giving was overwhelming and I never said to her it was cause I didn’t want to hurt. So but by April/ May 2022 I started to get my thinking worse, couldn’t reach my goals, couldn’t think straight and I was losing more myself in the emotional bond, I not going to lie I loved it because it gave me feelings i felt special because never had a relationship ship before, and with that I kept drinking Sertraline till 2023 July, by the time from 2022 January when I was 80 kgs, I end up with 108 kilos by September 2023, I absolutely lost myself in this, and when I started to get more weight I noticed myself in the mirror and I was feeling destroyed lower self esteem, and then I became fully dependent on her(may 2022), which should never happen. And I thought was because work stress but to compensate the mental effort I was overeating because everything I fought on goals and dreams was flying away.
Then a pattern of manipulation started from her side I don’t if she was scared of losing me or afraid or something, but everything I asked her like even small favours, or advices to buy stuffs for my place, since she is a woman she knows more about discounts quality’s and things. So I changed my bike with her help but with my money, bought couple things to my place with her advice and help with my money, but I always compensate her, taking to a nice meal, restaurant, sending money for coffee and things. And even doing this she started this pattern saying I was only friends for the things she could provide or give to me, but I was the one paying for everything and always trying to be thankful and compensate her. So in everything I asked like if she could help me I always compensate but it became a problem because always she used to put in my face when something happens between us, I said said several times I do care about you I appreciate your help and everything but you being hard, because it seems is because of you and not also my effort to work and buy things, and I mention so many times in the past 2 yrs the way she puts in my face is like affecting me like making me feel shit, totally different from someone else if they were going to help me. 

2023 - came and I was absolutely emotional attached and was difficult yr in everything in my life, I was lazy, taking big breaks to visit her in the countryside, lost in the goals and dreams, and I thought the problem was living in the big city and decided to move to the countryside next to her 15 Min close in Kent UK. I was so lost that I couldn’t also move on from my delivery job and everything.
So moved in Kent November 2023 and what is funny enough I sometimes have deep feelings and on December 23, we went TOB CAVERY to a roast dinner with her friends, and that day I felt absolutely cucco inside myself cause deep down I knew them before, but you know when you shouldn’t be there right? And I had the feeling I wouldn’t be in her life much longer, I panicked a bit and then forgot about it.

So 2024 - living in the countryside was good and I worked really hard my first months, so saved some 2 k in 4 months and was enjoying and a lot and then in April to May I started to be more friendly with my neighbour English girl, but nothing like sex or even relationship, just wanted to start making more friends and enjoy more the life in the country. She didn’t like much and to be honest started all again that emotions energy drain, in may I was so overwhelmed that I became desperate to go out the country for a 6 months break to try to get my shit together again, was absolutely hard, but then I didn’t tell her the truth and just told I wanted to go and find myself again, but her energy at the time was so much pressure that I stopped calling her all the caring names I used to call. 

So may was crazy, June a bit, but in July we travel for a week and then all were lovely again, then I got a job in a warehouse and I started to look after myself again going walks, 108 kilos September last year by December 2023 was 102, and by end of September 2024 was 95 kilos. I started to feel good again and then started to feel more sexually again since I have stopped Sertraline and as I lost weight started to feel the sex desire again and then where I fucked up on October, we had intimacy but then I didn’t fulfill her in what she wanted, she was upset and felt all rejected and everything and I know I shouldn’t have done or even tried because I just had a bit fun, but she always had hopes in having a relationship with me. So I said to her I couldn’t and told her would be better to her meet a man and start a relationship or something, and this times she listened to me went on a date had sex and then  days latter she was very different to me with the same questions again What is your problems with me and everything? I tried to explain I was a bit tired, but I was feeling emotional drained, I felt jealous as well to be honest and at that time when we were fine talking I saw a pattern of manipulation again, cause she was going date or a bit fun but using myself again as a emotional support and demanding words of affirmation, but at this time I was completely complete overwhelmed and dependent and I messaged her November 2024  we should walk away and stop this I don’t want to be manipulated, this is not right not ok, we have to stop seeing each other, going dinners, dog walk, coffee together and travel. 
And then we speak 5 days later when this happened and she said you are holding me back, that when I fully decided to let her go and also I said to her let me go. 

So couple weeks later beginning of December her daughter message me saying her mother is struggling with mental healthy and than I should Message her, because both of us can’t survive without each other. I replied saying we are still friends but I couldn’t be there anymore so I haven’t spoke to her since

December - 29/12/2024

I am in Belgium visiting my parents for holiday and I won’t lie since beginning of November when we stopped talking, I am feeling like shit, mentally drained, lost and all mixed feelings of hate sometimes, but I do know I really hurt her as well intentional and not intentional and I think she does think the same as well, but haven’t message her so far, sometimes I am reading articles about toxic here, or relation ship, friendship, situationship and I get desperate in the need of trying to message her and explain myself, but I know if I do it I will get myself lost all again, and if I eventually think in going back, the manipulation will be bigger and worse for me, since she already going having sex with people to find a relationship, don’t want to give emotional support like draining my energy. I want her to be happy and move on in her life and find someone who understands her and complete her, but I also think she still waiting my message cause I said I would
Message, but how can I message if am feeling so lost, confused, upset or allowing myself being manipulated intentional or not intentional? 

*****What would you guys do in my place, should stick with the no contact? I am not trying to punish anyone or trying to get her to message me first or anything like that, I am just doing this for myself, to get clarity, to see
My mistakes and improve them in a friendship or even in a relationship in the future, be a better human, trying to let it go these feeling of emotional drain, because I know if I eventually message I can say something that would hurt her more and sometimes being in silence is better. 

I still have her number and social media, I deleted my apps for the moment but also is not fair having to delete them to avoid to see her and everything after the hurt both of us caused to each other. I am am still absolutely lost, confused and trying to heal myself and in hope it doesn’t take longer than 6 months or something, but I know for the first time in my life coming back is not a option, also I don’t think we can be friends in the future as well? Cause it was bad for both sides and I don’t feel I could have a honest friendship after this, any advice???

I am coming back to the gym next week and will try to heal myself and it hurts so bad now things I did and what she did for me, but I will fine wherever it takes.  I just wanted to share
My history here and get advices and tell people when you meet the wrong woman or the wrong man is really fucked up.
 
Planning to start a new life as well in a new country in Europe when all this pain goes away.  And then be able to get a dog and work towards the goals again.


That was my first time writing here and I am sorry for the long text, I tried to explain the
Maximum I could. Also to mention I used to be much more normal before giving my whole energy that even going in a market for food shopping or coffee places or something I used to do became like a hard task having pânico attack because the place was too loud or busy. Therapy starts next week as well

1hovgzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_kneel_before_sara/comments/1hovgzf/ceos_submission_initiation_by_wine/,CEO's Submission - Initiation by wine,"Jessica White sat behind her massive mahogany desk, a symbol of the power and success she had carved out in the male-dominated business world. As the CEO of her own thriving company, she was a woman who commanded respect and inspired fear. Her sharp mind and even sharper tongue left no room for nonsense—she was a formidable leader, known for her unyielding stance and strategic brilliance. But while her exterior was ironclad, those close to her knew she wasn’t heartless—just uncompromising when it came to getting what she wanted.

Today was like any other, with back-to-back meetings and critical decisions to be made. She was about to head into another important meeting when her phone buzzed. Normally, personal messages during work hours were ignored without a second thought. But when she saw the name “X” flash on the screen, she paused.

Her breath caught. X was her secret, her escape. They had met months ago, and in that time, X had become the one person who could pull Jessica out of her meticulously controlled world. A Domme who had seen through her powerful exterior, X knew exactly what Jessica needed—to let go, to surrender, even if she resisted it with every fiber of her being. When X sent a command, Jessica felt the irresistible pull to obey, even as she fought against it.

The message was simple but potent: a photo of X’s feet, clad in sleek latex boots, resting casually on Jessica’s expensive fire pit table. A bottle of imported French wine—one Jessica had been saving for a special occasion—sat open next to the boots, a glass half-empty in X’s hand. Below the image was a single word: “Now.”

A rush of irritation mixed with anticipation coursed through Jessica. She knew what was expected of her, but the battle within her flared—her instinct to maintain control clashing with the deep-seated need to submit. With a frustrated sigh, she pressed the intercom. “Chloe, I need you to cover my meetings for the rest of the day. An emergency has come up.”

“Of course, Ms. White,” her assistant replied promptly.

Jessica grabbed her keys and headed out, her thoughts a chaotic mix as she drove home. The struggle within her was almost physical, a push and pull between her desire to remain in control and the undeniable draw of surrendering to X.

As she drove, her mind wandered back to the first time they had met. It was at an exclusive, private club—discreet, and the kind of place Jessica had never imagined herself entering. She had gone out of curiosity, more than anything, and had been immediately captivated by X. Tall, confident, and exuding an aura of dominance, X was impossible to ignore. Their eyes had met across the room, and in that instant, Jessica knew she had been seen in a way no one else had ever managed.

The first encounter was intense. X had pushed her, testing the limits of her control, demanding that Jessica give up the power she clung to so tightly. Jessica had resisted at first—how could she, a woman who never bowed to anyone, possibly submit? But the allure of letting go, of handing over control to someone else, was too strong. In a moment of surrender, Jessica had found herself on her knees, a position that was both foreign and thrilling. The feel of leather restraints on her wrists, the sting of a crop on her skin—it was all too much and not enough at the same time. The pleasure that followed was overwhelming, crashing over her like a tidal wave, washing away her carefully constructed defenses.

In X’s presence, Jessica could let go of everything—the responsibilities, the endless decisions, the constant demand to be strong. She wasn’t the CEO in those moments; she was simply Jessica, raw and vulnerable, needing the release that only X could provide.

By the time she reached her house, the sun was dipping low, casting long shadows over the manicured lawn. Jessica’s pulse quickened as she entered through the back gate, her heels clicking on the stone pathway. She found X lounging casually on the outdoor couch, her boots still perched arrogantly on the fire pit table, the half-empty wine glass in her hand.

Jessica’s irritation flared again. “Did you really have to open the imported French wine?” she demanded, her voice sharp with annoyance. “And get your feet off the table—it’s expensive.”

X didn’t move, didn’t even blink. Instead, she smirked, her eyes raking over Jessica with that same commanding gaze that had ensnared her from the start. “Kneel,” X said, her tone firm, leaving no room for debate.

Jessica froze, her heart pounding in her chest. Every instinct screamed at her to resist, to assert her dominance, but the command hung in the air, heavy with expectation. The struggle within her was intense—her natural inclination to maintain control battling against the deep, unspoken need to submit.

And there it was—the moment of truth. The iron-willed CEO, the woman who never backed down, found herself standing at the edge, teetering on the precipice of surrender once again.

Despite the urge to surrender raging within her, Jessica couldn't just hand over her authority in a heartbeat. Summoning her courage, she decided to defy Mistress X's command and said, ""Listen, I don't think you get it. We are not  doing that again. What went down at the bar was a one-time deal. I can't step back into that situation.""

X set the drink down on the fire pit table, locked eyes with Jessica, and firmly said, ""Kneel,"" her tone steady and unwavering just like before.

""Wha...t?"" Jessica stumbled over her words. She had always been quick with a comeback but Jessica was surprised and a bit flustered by X's firm stance, which left her feeling powerless and with little choice but to comply with X's directive and surrender to her authority.

Jessica found herself completely at a loss, frozen in place for an uncomfortable stretch of time. This was uncharted territory for her - a scenario where she didn't instinctively know how to react. X's steady gaze seemed to bore into her, silently demanding Jessica acknowledge her position and submit to her dominance.

When Jessica finally grasped the gravity of the situation, she humbled herself, sinking to her knees on the cold, hard floor. The fabric of her skirt strained against her legs as she adapted to the new, submissive posture demanded of her. With hands clasped behind her back and her head bowed, Jessica's gaze dropped to the ground beneath her. It's a vulnerable, almost penitent stance - a visible acknowledgment of her surrender and willingness to serve under X's command.

X wasn't surprised to see Jessica finally submit. She had sensed what Jessica desired the instant they crossed paths at the club. X figured Jessica would eventually come around and fall into her hands like any typical submissive woman after their incredible time at the club. But Jessica, being the strong and determined woman she is, fought off the temptation to return and give in to X.

X figured that all Jessica needed was a little push to finally embrace her desires. She wanted her to let go of control and show her true submissive side, the one that came out when they were alone in the club dungeon. So, X decided to take matters into her own hands and tracked down Jessica's address.

With a victorious smile, X broke the silence, saying, ""Seems like you remember the moment you surrendered to my control back then. I tell you to kneel, and you immediately put your hands behind your back and look down like a well-trained submissive.""

X rose to her feet, grasped the glass of wine, and began to approach the submissive woman she intended to own permanently. As she walked gracefully, the sound of her six-inch heels echoed on the hard floor. X inquired, ""You mentioned that the wine is quite expensive, did you not?""

Jessica lifts her head and answers her mistress' query, ""Yes. It was quite expensive wine."" X said ""Good"" and began to pour wine from her glass onto the floor. The wine created a puddle next to X. Jessica watched in shock as X poured the wine.

X gazed at a shocked Jessica and said, ""You wouldn’t want all that expensive wine to go to waste, right, Jessica?"" In that moment, Jessica realized what was happening. She had no choice but to go along with X. With a sense of dread about the humiliation that awaited her, Jessica responded, ""Yes, mistress. I wouldn’t want it to be wasted.""

X grinned at Jessica and said, ""Well, you know what to do. Go ahead.""

As the weight of the command settled upon her, Jessica felt a strange mix of dread and relief wash over her. The burden of choice, of agonizing over right and wrong, lifted from her shoulders. In obeying her Mistress' every whim, no matter how degrading, Jessica found a perverse sense of freedom.

With her rational mind pushed aside by submissive nature, Jessica White proceeded to fulfill her Mistress' degrading command. For CEO Jessica, the task would have been unthinkable, a stain on her hard-won reputation. But in this sacred space, none of that mattered. Here, she was simply Jessica - devoted servant, eager to prove her worth through obedience, no matter how humiliating the demands might seem to the outside world.

Jessica pulled her hands from behind her back, leaned forward, and put her hands on the ground. She began crawling on all fours toward the puddle of wine, ready to lap it up like a dog. With every inch closer to the puddle, the idea of licking the wine off the floor made her stomach twist uncomfortably.

As Jessica pulled her hands from behind her back and lowered herself onto all fours, a wave of shame crashed over her. The plush carpet beneath her palms, once a symbol of luxury, now felt like sandpaper against her skin. Each crawl brought her closer to the puddle, the acrid scent of spilled wine filling her nostrils. Her stomach churned in protest, a primal revulsion warring with the ironclad need to obey. This was not the refined sipping of fine wine, but a debased act of servitude. And yet, as she neared the spreading stain, Jessica felt a dark thrill course through her veins. The utter degradation of it all sent a forbidden heat pooling low in her belly.

Mistress X gazed down at the scene unfolding before her, a triumphant smile playing on her lips. The stark contrast between the dignified CEO crawling before her and the debasement of the act itself filled X with a profound sense of power and control. To witness such a respected figure reduced to this level of subservience was a heady experience, a potent reminder of the dynamics at play in their twisted game of dominance and submission.

X's eyes lingered on Jessica's form, the elegant lines of her body distorted by the unnatural position, the once-pristine dress now rumpled. A thrill ran through X at the thought of the woman's inner turmoil, the battle raging between pride and the desperate need to please.

Jessica paused her crawling when she finally got to the pool of crimson liquid, her heart pounded wildly in her chest. This was the ultimate test of her submission, the final step in shedding her former identity and embracing her new role as a submissive partner. With trembling hands, she lowered herself closer to the floor until her face hovered just above the surface of the spilled wine. 

As Jessica lowered her face towards the spilled wine, a myriad of emotions swirled within her. Shame burned hotly in her cheeks as she realized just how far she had fallen - from a respected CEO to a woman willing to debase herself for the pleasure of her dominant partner. Yet beneath the humiliation, a thrill of excitement coursed through her veins. This was what she craved, the complete surrender of control and the chance to submit to her deepest desires.

Jessica kept lowering her head until her nose nearly touched the surface of the spilled wine. With a deep inhale, she parted her lips and extended her tongue, lapping delicately at the first crimson droplet. A soft, needy whimper escaped her throat as the cool liquid coated her taste buds. Trembling slightly, she continued her ministrations, swiping her tongue back and forth with deliberate slowness. Each deliberate lap seemed to hold a deeper meaning, a ritualistic act of devotion and servitude. 

Each stroke of her tongue brought forth a fresh wave of shame, reminding her of how far she had fallen. Yet beneath the humiliation, a twisted sense of satisfaction grew - knowing that she was pleasing her dominant partner, submitting to their every whim, marking the moment when the powerful CEO she once was officially disappeared, replaced by a woman fully devoted to serving her dominant lover.

Jessica continued to lap at the spilled wine, her movements growing more frantic as she sought to please her unseen observer. The bitter liquid dripped down her chin, staining her once-pristine blouse, a stark reminder of her current state. As she drank, the cold floor began to numb her knees, a dull ache settling into her joints. The taste of wine on her tongue mingled with a different kind of intoxication – the heady rush of total submission.

As Jessica carried out her submissive act, Mistress X watched with an intense gaze, her expression a mask of dark satisfaction. She stood tall, arms crossed over her slender chest, heels clicking sharply against the hardwood floor - a commanding presence that filled the room. Her piercing green eyes never left Jessica's face, drinking in every detail of her degradation.

With each deliberate swipe of her tongue, Mistress X nodded approvingly, a slight smirk playing at the corners of her lips. Her chest rose and fell with measured breaths, as if savoring the sight before her. The air seemed to vibrate with her unspoken dominance, making Jessica acutely aware of her subservient state.

As Jessica devotedly licked the wine spill, she became acutely aware of Mistress X's approach, signaled by the distinct click of high heels against the floor. With each additional click, the distance between them dwindled until Mistress X loomed over Jessica's prone form. Yet, Jessica persisted in her degrading task, fearing the consequences of interrupting or faltering in her submission. The threat of punishment hung heavy in the air, compelling her to continue her humiliating act until completion.

Mistress X's sudden action sent a jolt through Jessica's body as the dominatrix's stiletto heel pressed firmly into her back. The sensation was akin to being branded, marking Jessica as property to be used and controlled. The degradation seeped into her very core, making her feel small and powerless beneath her mistress's imposing figure.

Yet, as the humiliation coursed through her veins, it ignited a strange, forbidden pleasure. The shock waves radiated downward, causing Jessica's nipples to stiffen within the confines of her lightweight linen shirt. The unexpected arousal only added to her discomfort, a confusing mix of emotions that left her breathless and aching for more. In this moment, Jessica was completely at the mercy of her mistress's whims, her body betraying her even as her mind reeled from the intense sensations.

Jessica's movements became mechanical, her actions driven by a primal instinct to serve and please her mistress. Like a well-oiled machine, she transitioned seamlessly into a rhythmic pattern, her tongue gliding across the floor to mop up every last drop of wine. Each lap brought her closer to completion, her focus narrowed to the task at hand.

In this state, Jessica had fully surrendered to her submissive nature, allowing the degrading scenario to push her into a euphoric trance-like state known as subspace. The lines between pleasure and pain blurred, and she found herself craving more of the intense, arousing sensations that flowed through her body. Her mind quieted, replaced by an unspoken obedience to Mistress X's will, as she continued to lick the floor with single-minded devotion.

With the wine spill eradicated, Jessica paused momentarily, her tongue still extended as if seeking further instruction. However, Mistress X's commanding presence and the lingering sensations coursing through her body kept Jessica in a heightened state of arousal.

On her tongue, Jessica could taste the faint residue of red wine, mingling with the metallic tang of her own saliva. The flavor was a reminder of her servitude, a constant connection to the floor she'd just cleaned with such dedication.

Jessica's nipples remained rigid beneath her shirt, the fabric rubbing against them in a maddening caress. Down below, a warm, throbbing ache pulsed between Jessica's thighs, her clitoris twitching with anticipation. The humiliation of the scene, coupled with the physical contact, had awakened a deep, primal desire within her. She could feel her juices beginning to moisten her panties, a testament to the intensity of her arousal.

Jessica remained frozen in place, bearing the unrelenting pressure of X's stiletto heel grinding into the small of her back. She lay unmoving, eagerly awaiting her dominant partner's next command with bated breath. To Jessica's surprise, No orders came from X. After a few charged seconds, she slowly lifted her stiletto-clad foot from Jessica's back, the cool air rushing in to replace the oppressive heat.

""Well done, my precious little pet"", X purred, her voice dripping with dark satisfaction. ""I must admit, I harbored doubts about your ability to fully submit, to give yourself over entirely to my authority. But seeing you now, so perfectly broken and compliant beneath my heel...it washed all my doubts away"". She circled around Jessica's prone form like a predator stalking its prey, drinking in every detail of the submissive's posture - the graceful curve of her spine, the tremble in her limbs, the glistening sheen of sweat on her skin.

""I've seen what I needed to see,"" X declared, her voice tinged with a hint of satisfaction. ""It's time for me to go."" The implication hung heavy in the air - Jessica's display of submission had fulfilled some unknown purpose for her mistress, and now their encounter was drawing to a close.

Jessica's heart sank at the prospect of being abandoned so soon after this intense display of submission. But she knew better than to beg or plead. Instead, she waited, on all fours, her eyes fixed on the floor.

But X wasn't finished yet. ""Before I leave, I want to prove your gratitude."" Jessica swallowed hard, understanding the weight of those words. This was her chance to demonstrate her obedience, to show X that she valued the experience they'd shared.

Jessica knew how to thank a dominant properly. She had spent countless hours researching and exploring the intricacies of submission. After her initial encounter with Mistress X at the club, Jessica had delved deeper into the world of BDSM, eager to learn and grow. With a deep bow of her head, she began the ritual of kissing X's boots, pouring all her emotion into the act.

With a deep bow of her head, Jessica leaned forward, her full lips making contact with the first boot. She pressed a gentle, lingering kiss to the polished leather, her breath warm against the surface. Her tongue darted out, tracing the intricate stitching along the boot's toe before withdrawing. She paused for a heartbeat, savoring the moment, before moving on to the second boot.

Next, she moved to the second boot, planting a soft peck on the instep before sealing her tribute with a final, meaningful press of her lips to the top. Throughout, her eyes remained lowered, focused on the task at hand, conveying her respect and gratitude.

As Jessica straightened up from her boot-kissing reverence, she gazed directly into Mistress X's eyes. Her own were filled with sincerity and a hint of awe, reflecting the depth of her appreciation. ""Thank you, Mistress"", Jessica murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. With that, she bowed her head slightly, acknowledging the end of their time together.

Mistress X's triumphant smile lit up her face as she turned to leave, the confident stride of a woman who knew she'd asserted her dominance. Jessica watched her go, a mix of emotions swirling within - relief, gratitude, and a tinge of lingering vulnerability. 

As Mistress X stepped out the door, she cast a final glance over her shoulder at Jessica, her eyes glinting with a promise of future encounters. ""I'll text you for your next instruction,"" she stated firmly, her tone leaving no doubt that Jessica should remain prepared and obedient.

Jessica nodded to herself, already mentally preparing for whatever lay ahead. As the door closed behind X, Jessica slowly rose to her feet, rubbing her reddened knees. She felt changed, transformed by the intense experience. Though physically freed, she knew the psychological impact would linger, a reminder of the depths of submission and empowerment she was capable of accessing.

With a deep breath, Jessica began to tidy up the space, her movements methodical and purposeful, a reflection of the newfound inner balance she'd discovered. Her phone, now an instrument of potential command, sat prominently on the coffee table, a constant reminder of the dominatrix's hold over her willing submissive.",1,1735476948.0,u_kneel_before_sara,0,1.0,False

I came to the UK August 2020 with 26 yrs old to live in London, started working as a delivery driver due some of the lockdown restrictions and lack of jobs, and was having a great time in my life financially and enjoying sightseeing, but as I was young never had a relationship before as I was focusing on saving some money to come to Europe since my family comes from Italy and I wanted to be close to Italian culture again. I had some casual sex, and I had with 4 to 5 people before nothing long, and then one day I met an woman at the time she was 38 or 39 yrs old coming from a break up relationship after being married for 20 yrs, her ex at the time became gay. I had about couple times sex with her like for fun and enjoying because I didn’t do much it before and I was having fun but deep down I knew we were not made to be couple, but the same time both of us enjoyed the attention we were giving to each other, I come from a family where we call people, lovely, angel, nice, hugs, kisses in the cheek, probably a bit different from the English Culture. There was a day she asked me if we were a couple and I said No we are not we just enjoying each other, but also I don’t know how to explain or maybe I wasn’t very direct at the time I was feeling a different energy like a heavy energy I would say for both sides and I said to her I couldn’t do more casual sex to her or anyone cause the energy I got was overwhelming and I said I can be friends if you want I will stop casual sex. She said we could be friends but at the time I knew that wasn’t correct as well because could be confusing for both, and I think even when I was lonely I still at that time could have control of my thoughts, goals and dreams. So by 2021 when we stopped sex she went for dating but nothing serious happened for her and then our friendship became strong, because we were talking to each other everyday and having fun, I used to sing on the phone, laugh lots like talk my politics shit, talking about travelling, dreams, goals and everything I always have been free spirit.  So was a strong bond or connection as you can say.
By the time 2021 like September, October some of my friends started telling me - look it seems you guys are in a relationship instead of a friendship, everything you do is like what a couple do, this is not healthy for you and not healthy for her, and the time by I need to give more and more my energy to check how her day was to be a perfect friend and then I stopped looking after myself I started to over eat, I always had anxiety and my anxiety levels went up so much plus the stress of the job being self employed and driving around London a bike. At October 2021 a couple days before my birthday she came to visit me from countryside and i remember my friends telling me to stop that because both of us were completely attached to each other and that wasn’t healthy, wasn’t a real friendship with boundaries and everything because we were relying on each other for emotional support all the time, and as we were not a couple or having sex(which helps with the pillars for a relationship), the mental efforts to be there all time to give emotional support, to make her feel special and everything without sex was absolutely hard, I haven’t done sex because I didn’t want to hurt her or play with her feelings, but she felt played and used anyway. So at that day I had a major anxiety crisis and I said to her we need to part ways, what we are doing is not healthy, we are like a couple and this is making me confused, is confusing you and we need to part ways, that was my first heavy emotional drain in my mind, I cried lots, made her cry and everything and I was sure that time walk away was the best to do to both of us, cause it wasn’t healthy , but she was crying and said about rejection and everything and I felt sorry and I decided to stay with her and told all my friends to fuck off and then they all walked away cause they were tying to help me but I couldn’t see like that. So I went doctor started taking pills for anxiety Sertraline, because even I was stressed and and I thought the reason for it was my past trauma of being bullied in school my last 2 yrs which was severe bullied my self esteem was destroyed, they used to hurt me kicking and everything so was really bad, in the beginning of the bullying I was really strong with 17 yrs old, but then it was the whole class and stuffs and for 2 yrs was a hell studying at that school but I never said anything to my parents, but also coming from a religious family that struggled a lot financially and see many times parents arguments and created me a bit trauma of having relationships. So I took the pills and started to give less anxiety and for the other side I became extremely lazy and dismotivated.

2022 - I decided to start January going gym and look after myself to lose the 10 kgs I put on in myself and try to get my shit together again, so by march She went in a date kissed a guy and then went dating with him and then I thought they would start talking move on to a relationship or something, but instead She didn’t, and she came back to me all frustrated saying What have you done to me? And put some of shit in my face, and I will be honest at that time I was doing really well with money, gym lost the kilos and started to find ways to make more money or improve myself. But that day when she put all the shit on me I got so emotional drained again and gave up about everything as a weak man would do. I stopped going gym the emotional support I was giving was overwhelming and I never said to her it was cause I didn’t want to hurt. So but by April/ May 2022 I started to get my thinking worse, couldn’t reach my goals, couldn’t think straight and I was losing more myself in the emotional bond, I not going to lie I loved it because it gave me feelings i felt special because never had a relationship ship before, and with that I kept drinking Sertraline till 2023 July, by the time from 2022 January when I was 80 kgs, I end up with 108 kilos by September 2023, I absolutely lost myself in this, and when I started to get more weight I noticed myself in the mirror and I was feeling destroyed lower self esteem, and then I became fully dependent on her(may 2022), which should never happen. And I thought was because work stress but to compensate the mental effort I was overeating because everything I fought on goals and dreams was flying away.
Then a pattern of manipulation started from her side I don’t if she was scared of losing me or afraid or something, but everything I asked her like even small favours, or advices to buy stuffs for my place, since she is a woman she knows more about discounts quality’s and things. So I changed my bike with her help but with my money, bought couple things to my place with her advice and help with my money, but I always compensate her, taking to a nice meal, restaurant, sending money for coffee and things. And even doing this she started this pattern saying I was only friends for the things she could provide or give to me, but I was the one paying for everything and always trying to be thankful and compensate her. So in everything I asked like if she could help me I always compensate but it became a problem because always she used to put in my face when something happens between us, I said said several times I do care about you I appreciate your help and everything but you being hard, because it seems is because of you and not also my effort to work and buy things, and I mention so many times in the past 2 yrs the way she puts in my face is like affecting me like making me feel shit, totally different from someone else if they were going to help me. 

2023 - came and I was absolutely emotional attached and was difficult yr in everything in my life, I was lazy, taking big breaks to visit her in the countryside, lost in the goals and dreams, and I thought the problem was living in the big city and decided to move to the countryside next to her 15 Min close in Kent UK. I was so lost that I couldn’t also move on from my delivery job and everything.
So moved in Kent November 2023 and what is funny enough I sometimes have deep feelings and on December 23, we went TOB CAVERY to a roast dinner with her friends, and that day I felt absolutely cucco inside myself cause deep down I knew them before, but you know when you shouldn’t be there right? And I had the feeling I wouldn’t be in her life much longer, I panicked a bit and then forgot about it.

So 2024 - living in the countryside was good and I worked really hard my first months, so saved some 2 k in 4 months and was enjoying and a lot and then in April to May I started to be more friendly with my neighbour English girl, but nothing like sex or even relationship, just wanted to start making more friends and enjoy more the life in the country. She didn’t like much and to be honest started all again that emotions energy drain, in may I was so overwhelmed that I became desperate to go out the country for a 6 months break to try to get my shit together again, was absolutely hard, but then I didn’t tell her the truth and just told I wanted to go and find myself again, but her energy at the time was so much pressure that I stopped calling her all the caring names I used to call. 

So may was crazy, June a bit, but in July we travel for a week and then all were lovely again, then I got a job in a warehouse and I started to look after myself again going walks, 108 kilos September last year by December 2023 was 102, and by end of September 2024 was 95 kilos. I started to feel good again and then started to feel more sexually again since I have stopped Sertraline and as I lost weight started to feel the sex desire again and then where I fucked up on October, we had intimacy but then I didn’t fulfill her in what she wanted, she was upset and felt all rejected and everything and I know I shouldn’t have done or even tried because I just had a bit fun, but she always had hopes in having a relationship with me. So I said to her I couldn’t and told her would be better to her meet a man and start a relationship or something, and this times she listened to me went on a date had sex and then  days latter she was very different to me with the same questions again What is your problems with me and everything? I tried to explain I was a bit tired, but I was feeling emotional drained, I felt jealous as well to be honest and at that time when we were fine talking I saw a pattern of manipulation again, cause she was going date or a bit fun but using myself again as a emotional support and demanding words of affirmation, but at this time I was completely complete overwhelmed and dependent and I messaged her November 2024  we should walk away and stop this I don’t want to be manipulated, this is not right not ok, we have to stop seeing each other, going dinners, dog walk, coffee together and travel. 
And then we speak 5 days later when this happened and she said you are holding me back, that when I fully decided to let her go and also I said to her let me go. 

So couple weeks later beginning of December her daughter message me saying her mother is struggling with mental healthy and than I should Message her, because both of us can’t survive without each other. I replied saying we are still friends but I couldn’t be there anymore so I haven’t spoke to her since

December - 29/12/2024

I am in Belgium visiting my parents for holiday and I won’t lie since beginning of November when we stopped talking, I am feeling like shit, mentally drained, lost and all mixed feelings of hate sometimes, but I do know I really hurt her as well intentional and not intentional and I think she does think the same as well, but haven’t message her so far, sometimes I am reading articles about toxic here, or relation ship, friendship, situationship and I get desperate in the need of trying to message her and explain myself, but I know if I do it I will get myself lost all again, and if I eventually think in going back, the manipulation will be bigger and worse for me, since she already going having sex with people to find a relationship, don’t want to give emotional support like draining my energy. I want her to be happy and move on in her life and find someone who understands her and complete her, but I also think she still waiting my message cause I said I would
Message, but how can I message if am feeling so lost, confused, upset or allowing myself being manipulated intentional or not intentional? 

*****What would you guys do in my place, should stick with the no contact? I am not trying to punish anyone or trying to get her to message me first or anything like that, I am just doing this for myself, to get clarity, to see
My mistakes and improve them in a friendship or even in a relationship in the future, be a better human, trying to let it go these feeling of emotional drain, because I know if I eventually message I can say something that would hurt her more and sometimes being in silence is better. 

I still have her number and social media, I deleted my apps for the moment but also is not fair having to delete them to avoid to see her and everything after the hurt both of us caused to each other. I am am still absolutely lost, confused and trying to heal myself and in hope it doesn’t take longer than 6 months or something, but I know for the first time in my life coming back is not a option, also I don’t think we can be friends in the future as well? Cause it was bad for both sides and I don’t feel I could have a honest friendship after this, any advice???

I am coming back to the gym next week and will try to heal myself and it hurts so bad now things I did and what she did for me, but I will fine wherever it takes.  I just wanted to share
My history here and get advices and tell people when you meet the wrong woman or the wrong man is really fucked up.
 
Planning to start a new life as well in a new country in Europe when all this pain goes away.  And then be able to get a dog and work towards the goals again.


That was my first time writing here and I am sorry for the long text, I tried to explain the
Maximum I could. Also to mention I used to be much more normal before giving my whole energy that even going in a market for food shopping or coffee places or something I used to do became like a hard task having pânico attack because the place was too loud or busy. Therapy starts next week as well

I have filled the cup twice already with hot water, and sipped it through the bombilla.   I already feel like literal jet fuel is coarsing through my blood.  It’s a fantastic feeling.   But I’m looking at all the herb still left in the gourd, and I don’t think I can drink anymore right now or I will explode.   

1.  Here are my questions:

2.  How long can I wait between pours?  Will the herb go bad if I save it for later?   

3.  Isn’t it a waste of herb to put so much in the gourd?  Would making a tea in a teapot be a better way of consuming it for a single person? Or how do you guys take it?


I usually drink ceremonial grade matcha and drink coffee maybe once every 2-3 weeks.    Used to be a daily coffee drinker but it had a lot of negative side effects so I decided to cut down.

Any guidance/tips would be greatly appreciated.

1hoveub,https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/1hoveub/thoughts_on_aprons/,Thoughts on Aprons,"“Have you ever attended a Lodge and worn a borrowed apron pulled from a drawer or box outside the door of the Lodge? Have you ever seen that one apron with coffee stains on it? If you grab one of those old worn out loaner aprons from the box and tie it around your waist as you hurry into the Lodge room, do you ‘wear it with pleasure to yourself and honor to the Fraternity?’” -Bro. Patrick Craddock


A Masonic apron should never be an afterthought of lodge preparation. It is the badge of a mason...meaning the wearing of it is literally the identity of the wearer as a mason. 

Aprons were not always  mass produced cotton, they were handmade leather or cloth aprons with embroidery, cross stitch, or painting that reflected the individual’s Masonic journey. Working tools and symbols that were of particular interest or meaning to the mason that owned the apron. 

Being a mason is more than sitting in a lodge meeting. It is more than wearing a ring or pin.

Freemasonry is when,in a moment of quiet reflection that every man finds at least once in the day; he looks to the lessons taught in lodge. He ponders the working tools, symbols and the meanings thereof. 

“To a thoughtful Brother the apron should remain the focal point of his self examination and reflection – and should be the focus of continued reflection and self examination – year after year – as he grows and matures in life and in Masonry. He will consider what it means to be worn with dignity and honor. He will reflect on his actions and will consider the apron as a reminder, or standard, for his actions and deeds.”- Bro. Patrick Craddock

We as freemasons and as men, should strive to live a life worthy of this honored badge, this apron that is an outward sign of an inward obligation to live justly and upright. 

We must take pride in our craft. We must remember that, although we travel together, our journey is that of individual growth. 

Look to the east; see the goal. Walk upright upon the steps of the degrees. Take with you the tools to build your spiritual temple, dedicated to Almighty God. Work with zeal and wisdom. 

We are more than a fraternity, more than a lodge...we are a sacred band... dedicated one to another and to Almighty God  by our obligations. Tasked with the Pursuit of wisdom that we may live morally and act with generosity. 

Take pride in your badge. Wear it with pleasure to yourself and honor to the fraternity.

**TLDR: I was super close with my Ex-husband's family. We texted and called a lot. Losing his family was the hardest part of my divorce. My current fiance's family acts as if I dont exist. They aren't mean, but they also quite literally ignore me more often than not. What is it like in your life? Is this normal? Could it possibly be because my ex's family was very poor and my current partner's family is affluent?**

**If you want the background and details:**

I am 33, and was married before. I am currently engaged again. I tried very hard for the first 2 years of my new relationship to ingratiate myself into my partner's family, but nothing has worked.

The main reason that this all worries me is for the future. What happens if a parent gets sick? When we have kids? God forbid something happens to me or my future husband..? It terrifies me to think about. Who will be there for us?

From the beginning of knowing this family, I tried to set up coffee dates with his step mom (mother passed away), and tried to ask questions to promote good conversations and learn about their them. This kind of worked, but it was never reciprocated.

I bought Christmas/birthday/fathers/mothers day gifts, but nothing seems to crack them into wanting to get to know me. In particular my SO's brother has been VERY absent. When we speak it's like I am talking to a distant coworker. He has not once responded to a Merry Christmas, Happy 30th (despite literally getting a cake delivered to him on his birthday), or even a congrats on XYZ text or phone call.

I tried to invite his parents over to dinner frequently in the first 2 years. We lived a 5 minute drive from his dad's office and a 10 minute drive from their home, and they accepted a dinner invitation from us twice. Sometimes they would drop by with cookies or snacks from their church, but they only ever entered our (frankly beautiful) house 4 times in 2 years, and only twice beyond the front door.

At 2 years we got engaged, and the step mom agreed to go wedding dress shopping with me, but after 4 months I gave up on asking her as she always said she would call or text me about it and it never happened. She also left me on read when I texted her about it.

At 2.5 years we hit some relationship issues and I cancelled our wedding (partner didn't cheat, but he did have doubts and we needed to sort out our unhealthy attachment styles).

His family wasn't there for me when I cancelled the wedding, despite knowing I have no family to speak of. I didn't expect them to be a shoulder to cry on, but I did hope they would offer to uninvite their friends. Instead they quite literally ghosted me and left me on read for 4 months. They even started a new group chat without me!

Four months later the step-mom took me out to lunch and apologized for not being there for us/me, and ignoring my messages (which were things like congrats on the huge promotion!). At this point we had already packed our things and were moving to Europe in days.

Since moving abroad I tired to stay in contact with them, but they never replied or took much interest, so I just stopped. After I stopped the step-mom then started texting more frequently, asking how we were are etc. I would send pictures and ask her questions and try to set up a time to FT, and then she would ghost again.

The brother got a serious girlfriend and they moved in together. I tried to connect with her also as we get along great in person. I thought finally someone in this family I can be friends with! We like the same kinds of books, and media, so we can talk about that for hours. But again if we aren't together she doesn't respond either. I understand being busy but these people aren't getting back to me for 3 months at a time and are active on social media. Now I am thinking maybe I am just crazy and this is how all in-laws are? Maybe my exes family were the weird ones?

They truly act as if I don't exist unless my SO is FaceTiming with them, then I will pop in and say hello.. Now we are 4 and 2 months into our relationship, and we are planning a wedding again. This weekend the brother and GF have basically left us on read because ""The GF has another wedding to attend in May"".. blah. 

The only reason I can think they would treat me like this is that they think our relationship is a mess- but I think we are quite happy. Even in our worst of times I maintained good boundaries (never gossiped to his family) and I think we still presented as a united front.",1,1735476052.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

(I’m not even into Christmas, like she is.)

We hung out around Christmas, but it wasn’t just the two of us—she brought her new friends from school to the amusement park and suggested they explore on their own. I thought it would be nice to hang out together and get to know them, which seemed to be what she wanted as well. We both have multiple friend groups, which is cool, but it felt like her other friends were the main focus. 

They were still very caught up in their recent experiences together, understandably, but that left me feeling disconnected, especially since I hadn’t seen her in more than half a year. 

We had to speak in a secondary language to communicate with her friends, and we didn’t really have any private, one-on-one conversation. My friend acknowledged forgetting to give me a present only after we met up (second year in a row this has happened), but I never got any thanks or recognition for mine—even days after Christmas.

Now she’s on a ski trip, posting pictures of her experiences with her new friends, including only tagging them from our amusement park trip, and I’m feeling overlooked. I’ve been making an effort to stay in contact for a while, but it feels like she’s distancing herself and focusing on other people, even though we both occasionally reach out.

I understand people get busy—we both have—but it seems like basic courtesy to at least acknowledge the Christmas present, especially when she knew what it cost and hadn’t gotten me one. It’s especially disappointing since I’m broke and wanted to show her I still value our friendship by giving her something nice and inviting her over for New Year, which was before I found out about her ski trip.

I’ve initiated texting over the holidays, and although she hasn’t brought up the gift, she did invite me for coffee “some time when she’s back”. Should I just let this slide?",3,1735476041.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

By know I know how alcohol works and what it does to my nervous system. The day after drinking alcohol ive had the worst panic attacks. This was in the beginning after being stressed out from covid for 2 years and felt on the edge of a burnout. 

I was hangover and just had a cup of coffee and we headed on this trip tonan amusementpark. I suddenly got bothered by the bright lights, many cars on the highway and the fear feelings started creeping up. Then I entered this tunnel and it felt like a wave of doom came over me and I struggled to get the car to safety. This started the whole fear of panic feelings that led to agoraphobia. Im not scared to drive or be on a plane. Im scared to get in a situation where I get a panic attack and cant leave directly and might possibly put others in danger. 

Im wondering how much of a role does alcohol play in this whole thing though? Despite it like caffeine doing something to your nervous system the day after. 

Like are there people who had drinking problems, possibly to cope quit drinking and were panic free after a while? 

My grandfather was an alcoholic and apparently suffered from agoraphobia as well. He could only show up places when drunk.

I know plrnty of heavy drinkers who are fine in that regard though.

I met my wife through a couple we both are friends with (on different groups). Let's call them FRI1 and FRI2. 

FRI1 and FRI2 were always nice people, the heart of the party, well mannered and educated, really nice guys. We use to hang out a lot with them and still do.

They have kids, aged 8 and 6.

FRI1 and FRI2 believed in a ""laissez-faire"" (let it be) type of teaching, meaning that the kids should auto-regulate themselves, have their own schedules and solve their own problems. 

They also didn't believe in regular institutions for education until mandatory, so, until starting school at 6, they sent their kids to a ""wilderness school"" which is like a kindergarten but they're out in the wild all day. This sounds nice until you learn that the place is also a ""let it be"" kind of school so, if the kid wants to climb 5 meters up a tree, you let him do it, paying attention but never setting limits on what the kid can do.

This kind of ""freedom"" on the education of their kids have resulted in a complete nightmare. In a mayor way. Kids don't have sleep times, so one goes to sleep at 8, the other at midnight, don't have dinner time, so they grab whatever they want from the fridge to eat, they are allowed to drink coffee or non-alcoholic beer for some reason, they can shower when they want to or spend a couple days without showering if they don't.

FRI1 and FRI2 believe they're on the right track but you can tell they're having a really bad time with it, however, they haven't set any limit to their kids in their whole life, so any attempt right now to establish limits goes terribly wrong. On the rare occasion that we've tried to set limits to their kids when we are together, FRI1 and FRI2 have told us that we shouldn't.

Their house has a ""playing room"" that looks like a warzone and FRI2 has told us that she has to wear earplugs during the day if the kids are around because they are loud.

Me and my family live in the bigger house of the group, so we are used to having people around and host meetings here.

Last time the group came here, about 2 years ago, kids were playing in my kid's bedroom, being loud but being kids. When my wife goes to check on them, she finds out that FRI1 and FRI2 kids have taken markers and written all over the furniture, she gets furious and start telling the kids that is not something that they should do.

FRI1 comes to see what the problem is, finds out about his kids writing on the furniture, shrugs and sais ""oh, yeah, the thing is that we allow them to do it at home, no biggie, nothing that a little elbow grease, some sanding and some oil can't fix"".

I ended up doing the cleaning. You can still see some of the marks if you look closely even after a couple sessions.

When they left, I told my wife ""those kids are never setting a foot in this house again"".

To this day, every time we get together with the group, our house is never available for the event. FRI1 and FRI2 never said a word, but they hint at it like ""kids would be a little better controlled at home instead of a park, right?"" but I pretend like I didn't hear it.

I ended up moving 1,657 miles away from my family to be with him, and  I've been here for 2 years depressed the entire time . I have no car (sold it to move) no friends I can't find a job here. I have to work at night (I'm a morning person and I'm kinda scared to work at  night ).  We fight constantly. When I first moved here, he would just go get drunk with his friends all night. That has stopped, but now he's home all the time and does absolutely nothing. We have new light fans, ect, for the house  that has been sitting in the basement sense  I moved here . I clean everything and he complains if I don't wash his clothes I cook every night make his lunch his coffee.  He tells me when I talk, I'm annoying, I try to explain, I'm just lonely, and all I get is a I'm sorry.  He  texts this girl every day, too (he says they're just friends) they tell each  other they love and miss each other . Also, he choked me once while we were in an argument, and I can't seem to forget it .
I honestly don't know why I'm writing this. Things have been good lately, but idk I always feel like I need to just leave . It would be nice to hear what others think of this situation. Thank you. Have a great day !",1,1735474955.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,1.0,False

No matter what grind we use (coffee shop or pre-bag from grocery), the pressure gauge does not move at all and it seems like the water is flowing too quickly. Will be calling Breville tomorrow, but hoping others can suggest ideas to try.

1houz32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1houz32/was_i_just_kept_around_until_she_was_fully_over_me/,Was I just kept around until she was fully over me?,"Gonna be completely honest from the get go. I fucked up, we were together for a bit over 2 years, we were planning on getting a house together after basically already living together. I have had issues in my past about people leaving me, when I was a teenager my mum packed her bags and left. I was then basically left homeless.

During the planning of getting a house with my girlfriend at the time, I started to panic. The whole relationship was going great, we barely ever argued or anything like that. When we were planning/ looking at houses I started to go out drinking a lot and one night I got black out drunk and kissed someone else. I barely remember it but when I had confirmation that it happened, I took a few days to process and then told her. I broke up with her and told her that I wasn't able to provide her with what she wanted right now and basically didn't deserve her.

It was hard, but I know it was the right decision to tell her and let her move on with her life. We broke up a bit over 3 months ago. During this process she would regularly call me when she was upset and I would do my best to help her in any way I could, wether it would be staying up with her all night and cuddling her and saying I'm sorry or sending her food packages to make sure she's eating. I was genuinely trying to change for her and was trying to show her this. I basically cut out all drinking and other bad habits and have been working on my self mentally and physically.

Things seemed to be in a weird limbo state for the past few months, one week/day it would be very upsetting and I would be consoling her and trying to help her heal, the next we seemed like we were starting to progress and we're laughing and cuddling again.

When things were bad, I would get messages like ""I look good don't I, bet you wish you never cheated"", or she would randomly tell me how she's planning a holiday and can't wait to talk to guys with ""attractive accents"", or how she went out and an older guy bought her a bottle of Prosecco so she pecked him. I told her I didn't want to hear those things but it would always be the same response, ""but you made the mistake"".

And although it hurt to hear those things, I felt like I had to accept and listen to it cause she was right, and I had to punish myself for it. I have no issue with her wanting to move on, but I just didn't want to hear about all of her exploits.

To be completely honest, towards the end of these last 3 months, she was coming round and we were cuddling, being intimate, she was asking me if I was speaking to anyone else, she was saying she missed me etc... we agreed to go for coffee and have a proper catch up, I thought we were steering towards the right direction. We were calling each other nicely, checking up on each other etc…

Then suddenly, I don't hear from her. I tried reaching out and eventually I got a phone call from her saying that ""it's just a friendly thing and that she's sorry for messing me around towards the end"". I don't have an issue if she's moved on, I want the best for her. I then find out that she's dating someone new, they started dating within a week/ a few days after our last time meeting and being intimate (it was after this time that we agreed to go for a coffee). I found out through a friend and messaged her saying that I know, and that I would be removing her from social media but she has my number if she needs me.

She then calls me straight after I sent that message asking if I'm ok. She asks what we’re going to do going forward about social media and if we should remove each other. I say it’s for the best, cause I would hate to be the guy that was dating a girl that was still in contact with her ex. She then says “but I wouldn’t be posting him for a few months anyway” I obviously say that's it's not great to hear but she has to do what's best for her. We then talk for an hour and a half on the phone, she’s telling me how nice this new guy is, she told me that he’s willing to wait for her to be ready for a relationship. She then tells me it’s just “casual and seeing where things go”. She then tells me how she’s already met his brother, is going to his birthday party, and has been invited to meet his parents. They’ve only been dating for 2 weeks, she then reiterates that it’s just “casual and it might not even go anywhere” but she “can’t say no to free food” whilst telling me about where they’re going for their next date. 

We agree to then not keep in contact, but we also agree that we will have to be in touch at some point in the future because it’s our mutual friends birthday soon and we should make sure that we’re both comfortable with each other going. I then don’t hear from her for a few days, then I wake up to a “happy Christmas” message from her, so I reply with “merry Christmas, wishing you the best and hope your doing well, take care :)🎄” and I haven’t her from her since.

I’m sorry for the LONG message but I’ve just been really struggling to process my emotions. I understand that if I didn’t kiss someone else, then none of this would’ve happened. But I also don’t condone how she’s been acting after if it ended. just want to state again, if she wants to move on and be happy with someone else then that’s fine. I just feel like I was used as a stop gap until she was either fully over me or had someone else lined up. It’s probably selfish to think of it like that but it’s just how I feel.

Ello ello! My name is Lewis, I'm 30 and from the UK, more specifically the North West.

I'm on the search for someone like minded and just ""gets it"". I'm searching for that connection, that something which just makes you want to fall into things deeper.

I'm interested in getting to know each other on a deeper level, go on dates, have fun and just enjoy life! At this point where I am in my life, I just want to be happy with the person I choose to spend the rest of my life with.

I know what I want from a relationship and I'm not afraid to show it. Someone to be by each others sides through thick and thin, the good and the bad. Who understands you've got to weather the stormy seas to enjoy the good in life.

I work a crazy schedule so I'm available all hours of the day throughout the week.

I value trust and honesty above all else in a relationship. If I can't trust you, what's the point? I'd much rather be hurt than your brutal honesty than your lies and attempts to soften the blow. With that said, I'm not interested in wasting yours or my time. So I'll get it out of the way now that I have a 4 year old child from a previous relationship.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it

I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

5""10, 75KG, slim/athletic build, blue eyes, medium length brown hair/beard.

Selfie time so you can see my in the flesh: https://imgur.com/a/Z17J0qs

When I leave the house I enjoy exploring, hiking, cycling, swimming, trying new experiences, being in nature and going to gigs/festivals.

Some of the stuff I enjoy:

- Hiking/cycling - I love being outdoors
- Listening to heavy metal/rock
- Computer programming (self taught, wanting to turn it into a career. Making my own android game)
- Watching documentaries/anime (give me your best, I need some new shit to watch)
- Playing games (PC gamer at heart. Played a lot of OSRS, Minecraft, Rust to name a few).
- Board games (Terraforming Mars, Scythe, D&D, Gloomhaven etc)

I'm also 420 friendly and enjoy partaking in the devils lettuce.

This year I'm looking to start the gym full time, go rock climbing/bouldering, learn to play the drums and finally get my driving licence!

I'm also in the process of completely redecorating my house from top to bottom. No car but I do have a house.

What I'm looking for in you:

24-34 (not opposed to younger/older but looking for around my age). You don't have to be the same continent/time zone. I'm open to LDR but it has to be with intention. Similar interests and hobbies.

More importantly, you're interested and ready to put in the effort to get to know each other with the intention of things progressing to something serious.

If you're interested in chatting, pop me a quick message and we'll see how things go :).",1,1735474161.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I'll try keep this short and sweet, unlike me. I'm your typical British tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a serious friendship with someone who I click with and we just get it. Someone who has the time and effort to invest in creating a lasting bond, who I can be my silly self around without worry about being judged.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

- I enjoy being outdoors and hiking/cycling/exploring
- I play videogames although mostly stick to OldSchool RuneScape
- Big heavy metal fan - throw some recommendations my way!
- Also enjoys watching anime and documentaries.
- Occasionally I play some board games with friends. Terraforming Mars is my new favourite.
- I've been working on/off now for a while on an android game. I leave it for a few months then forget where I'm up to and start again.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 24-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Please send your application via DM. I'd appreciate more than just a hello. And also a picture so I can put a face to the words.
