1iui4mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iui4mf/my_best_friend_attacked_me_lied_about_it_and/,"My best friend attacked me, lied about it, and turned everyone against me. I now have no friends and no support.","A few weeks ago, my best and only friend drove over to my house uninvited and intimidated and attacked me over his rank in my school chemistry club. It was caught on security camera, but now he has turned everyone against me, and I am truly isolated. On top of that, I run my school's chemistry club, and none of leadership does anything. I'm completely alone and don't know what to do.

This post is very long, but I really need outside advice. I have a TL;DR at the bottom.

Before I begin, know that I live in a bubble. I'm not going to say where I'm from, but my town, which I'll call Joe, is very rich and a bubble. People here are fake and not real. All of what happened was so stupid and silly you may doubt it's real, just as my brother and parents did before they looked at the security camera footage of the attack and heard what happened, but it is all real. Just know that the people at Mat (what I'll call my school) are very very immature and childish, they all exemplify Joe's fakeness.

Here is some background: I (16M) used to live in a big city, but just before quarantine, I moved to Joe, a nearby rich town. I have struggled with depression my entire life, and it has only gotten worse with the stress and pressure that high school brings. My entire life everyone has been telling me that I'm gifted and very smart, which has put even more pressure on me to succeed and excel, but I have my doubts that I have the strong future they all think I will. I moved to Joe in seventh grade, and started in person school for seventh grade's final two months, where nothing notable happened other than me being weird and having social problems. I always knew I wasn't exactly normal, but ever since quarantine ended and I moved to Joe, I've started noticing it more.

**Long Background: Quarantine to Freshman year**

Here is some very long background on my life since I moved to Joe and it ties in to what happened. I guess it isn't a necessity to read this to understand what happened, but I've never been able to talk to a truly neutral outside party who hasn't already judged me from the beginning on this, so it'd mean a lot to me if you did.

In eighth grade, I made my first friend, who I'll call Lime. Lime was my best friend, but I always felt he treated me somewhat poorly- he acted like he was doing me a favor by being my friend. I also briefly interacted with the tag kids, a group of kids who played tag at lunch. One of them is the subject of this post, Talin, but I also came into contact with Dillon. Most of the tag kids liked me, and I showed them finger fencing, a simple poking duel game that requires strength and dexterity, which I was insanely good at, until Dillon walked right into me dueling talin (we were a good bit away from everyone else) and dropped his lunch, which he got very mad at me for.

When high school started, Lime officially started hanging out with the tag kids, so I did too, and boy did Dillon hate me. This was also the point that he became a big weed dealer and started making a lot of racist, homophobic, and antisemetic remarks. One day, I made a joke to a mutual friend who I'll call Texas about slipping something in Dillon's drink (he stole drinks from a supermarket nearby Mat every lunch) to make it taste bad as a revenge prank. I wasn't serious, I was just upset with Dillon and I guess just fantasizing about getting back at him since I have always been short, out of shape, and unpopular, whereas he had several girlfriends at once and was the leader of the tag kids.

Texas told Dillon, and Dillon told everyone that I actually tried to poison and kill him but failed. Everyone started hating me even more since them, but since I knew it'd be impossible to convince them Dillon was lying, since, like I said, Joe is a bubble and the people here are all fools and fake. They would never believe the words of an unpopular weirdo against that of a popular kid, so I just told them that I was temporarily manic as a result of medication I was taking. You don't need to tell me how stupid of a thing that was to say, but at the time I didn't know they thought I tried to kill him, I thought they thought I just generally tried to harm him or something. That marked a big turning point where the tag kids started treating me even worse.

That is the end of freshman year.

**Long Background: Sophomore year to Junior year (present)**

As Lime shifted away to join the drama friend group, Talin became my best friend. He was weird like me, but he was also tall and athletic (like the vast majority of Joe and people at Mat) and he had friends and was not nearly as unpopular with the tag kids. It was around this time that Dillon was expelled for writing swastikas and ""I HATE ALL (hard r n words)"" on a girl's face and posting it on social media. He was also failing all his classes, lived far away, and it was common knowledge that he brought a lot of knives to school, many of which I had seen in person.

Now we are at junior year, which is my current year. I left the tag kids, who now have a true repuutation for being weed addicts and racists, to basically sit by myself at lunch while Talin hung out with the drama friend group. I have nothing against drama kids, but that friend group is sick in the head. Talin told me about them and how they cut and scar themselves at night and compare cuts with each other through their group chat, even Talin once dug a pencil line deep into his wrist because he was bored in class. None of them are depressed, they seem to do it because they are bored and seek attention.

Talin was my best friend, and he used to call me almost evert night to talk about things and stuff, and I'd talk to him about my depression and stress a lot, although it was blatantly obvious to me that he didn't understand at all what it was like and never would. He has a 4.83 GPA, but believe me when I say he is one of the most stupid people I have ever met. Mat is just a school with a LOT of grade inflation and his rich parents buy him the best tutors for everything. I talked to him late sophomore year about my ambitions to be an oncologist, and he told me he wanted to be an inventor. I asked if he was serious and told him about why that might not be wise, but he was dead set on it. I think he still is.

Talin would give me advise on how to get in shape and fix my life, but he'd only do it to help himself. He brought me to the gym with him for a while, but I never got anything done since I found it very boring, so I stopped, but when I and my friends I'll call Brad and Lake started to get into rock climbing over the summer and wanted him to do it with me, he never put any effort in and never wanted to go. After I came back from a trip during summer, everyone stopped going, so I had no one to belay me, and while I really wanted to continue rock climbing and always exercised a lot when I did, I stopped going and haven't gone since.

I always felt that Talin had a sort of messiah complex and thought himself as my savior and he had to save me, but he'd only 'help' me in ways that helped himself too. Also, it is worth mentioning for the future that on my occasions, Talin has told me he believes he doesn't feel any empathy. I always thought he was joking, but he held firm every time, and on my occasions, he did show signs of lack of empathy, but I always thought he was just joking or messing around.

Some of the things we talked about at night were his interest in girls, since he was desperate for a girlfriend, but he got rejected by a girl he liked in the drama friend group, and then he tried lusting after a very popular girl who was obviously just toying with him, which I told him, and he said he didn't care because he was willing to take the chance that she may be into him. I told him about my stress and depression, and since I trusted him more than anyone else in the world, and he was my only real friend and trusted confidant, I even told him how I was romancing a girl in a video game and liked it since it simulated something I think I might never have, at least not for a very very long time.

**Recent background of incident**

Recent background:

Here is where we approach the subject of this post. I want to be an oncologist, and have an interest in chemistry, so I started my school's chemistry club. It was my idea alone, and I filled out all of the forms and did all of the work to start the club myself. Brad, one of my friends, and Talin, my best friend, both wanted to be vice presidents, so I made them both VPs along with my oldest friend in Lime, who also joined as a VP after declining my request, then later coming to me and fully changing his mind.

I also had an argument with Brad that lasted several weeks because he and Talin wanted to be called co-founders on the club constitution and have that be their titles, but I held firm every time and told them that the club was my club and only exists because of me, and this made brad very mad each time and he'd change his title in the club constitution every time I wasn't on it, but he finally stopped after he realized he could just lie on college applications. I hired a really nice guy named Caleb as treasurer, and Brad's sister Nat as secretary.

The general job that chem club leadership has is simply to find experiments, get them approved by the club advisor, purchase any required chemicals that the school doesn't have, find proper instructions and apply them to my pre-made slideshow. In meetings, we take attendance, present the slides, and everyone in the meetings help conduct the experiments. We hold meetings one every two weeks at lunch, though we do delay them often.

Here is a basic list of my and the VPs' responsibilities:

\-help find and prepare chemistry experiments

\-get experiments approved by club advisor

\-edit my preexisting slideshow to fit the new experiment

Chem club leadership would completely ignore me when I'd ask them to help find experiments in the chem club leadership group chat, and when I'd ask them in person, they'd always come up with bullshit excuses. The combined force of 3 VPs would only say some sentences off a slideshow and copy paste the attendance form onto every new slideshow once every two weeks or so, which Brad would do DURING the meetings right before we present, even though he could do it from home and it'd take like ten seconds.

I can't present the slides, even though they are very short, because I have a very bad psychological stutter that developed over quarantine. I can get stuck on a word or sentence and it can take a very long time for me to get past them, and since Mat is a fake school of bubble people, anyone who is not 'normal' in their eyes and not fake like them gets relentlessly bullied and mocked.

Over christmas break, I started to get fed up with chem club leadership because they were doing literally nothing to help outside of meetings, which was 99% of the job. Over the four and a half weeks between are last meeting from the first semester and our first meeting of the second semester, I asked them in the chem club leadership group chat once every week for them to look and report their findings, but they would literally completely ignore me every single time. After winter break, I even confronted Lime and Talin about this, but as usual they came up with bs excuses and promised they'd help out more.

When the next meeting started, I gave everyone but Caleb (he is super nice and treasurer rank doesn't require he help with this stuff) a firm warning and told them that if they continued to not help at all, I'd take away their ranks. Lime promised he'd help more and gave the bs excuse that he was busy all the time (Talin used to tell me about how he'd hang out like every night with Lime and the drama friend group to do weed, trespass, and climb abandoned buildings), somehow too busy to even acknowledge my texts over an entire semester or spend 10-20 minutes once every two weeks to find experiments. Talin was incapable of taking responsibility, and tried to convince me that he was in fact helping, but it was blatantly obvious it was all bs. Brad got defensive and threatened that if I talked to him this way, ""who would present the slides, since you obviously can't.""

This was a reference to how I have a very bad stutter that the fake bubble people of Mat are very mean about. Lem promised he'd help more ( a lie) and made a bs excuse before asking if he could leave the meeting to get a snake from the supermarket near school. Seeing how these meetings are less than once every two weeks, are planned weeks in advance, he already had lunch with him, it was his job to show up at the meeting especially since he did absolutely nothing outside of meetings, and going to the supermarket takes over half of lunch, I told him no.

Later, when we started the experiment, he and Nat left anyway, and returned in the last minute of the meeting. I asked him why he left, and he said it was because the experiment was just about to start so 'I clearly had it under control.' He and Nat missed the entire meeting, and seeing how Nat's only job is basically to take meeting minutes, and she missed the experiment and everything that happened that meeting, she completely failed in her duties so she could buy some candy from the nearby supermarket.

I was assertively texting the chem club leadership gc often over the four weeks between that meeting and our next (it got delayed for reasons I'll get to), and they all got very very mad and defensive. I asked them not to use chatgpt for experiments since it only knows like 20 and I've been through them all, and it can provide inaccurate and incomplete instructions that almost never include measurements or concentrations.

They fought me a LOT when I'd ask them for help, and the combined effort of 3 people over a month brought me one experiment Talin found through chatgpt (he denied it at first but admitted it later), which I had already discussed and decided against last semester. I told them I wouldn't approve it, and Brad called me a mad dictator having a power trip and Talin fought me on my decision.

This was all they did as the weeks passed by, and I met with Talin in person one school day since our friendship had been very strained over the chemistry club issues, and he wanted to resolve things, but he still could not take responsibility for being a VP, an he even lied to me and said he already made a slideshow on the redox reaction (chatgpt experiment) even though I didn't approve it, in an attempt to manipulate me into approving it and letting him do it, but as I grilled him to let me see it before he'd present it to the club, he eventually told me it wasn't finished, then later told me he had only finished one slide, and at the end he confessed that there was no slideshow. I told him that I might have to remove his rank if he'd act like this, but he then told me that if he lost his rank, he'd make sure no one would ever show up to chem club again. I asked him if he was blackmailing me, and he said yes.

Talin got so mad over this that he yelled at me in front of the school and told me he never wanted to be my friend again.

**the Incident**

Here is the incident that the title refers to:

He drove to my house the day after, uninvited, to hang out and resolve things. He told me to bring up my bad of slingshots to use against trees, so I went up to his car parked in my driveway, but his car would never leave with me in it. We spoke of the chemistry club, and how after all this time he STILL hadn't used anything other than chatgpt, and the only experiment ALL of chem club leadership had found was chatgpt's first suggestion, and how they still hadn't started the slideshow (I told them I'd sit this one out to see how they could to what I do on their own), and he got so angry over this that he told me that everyone hates me and no one wants to hang out with me because I act illogical and do stuff like this. This is a response to how I haven't hung out with friends in a lot of months, and I haven't hung out with talin in a month or so.

I told him I didn't want to argue anymore and just want to drive somewhere and hang out, and he agreed, but instructed me to offer him 20 dollars if I brought up the club again, or leave the car. This was just after he pressured me into hanging out with him by telling me that no one wants to hang out with me. Talin tries to bribe and be bribed a lot, but I decline him every time because I view working with money like that between friends to be unethical. He ignored me, and demanded I offer him the money. I tried convincing and promising him I wouldn't bring it up again, but he called me a liar. After I asked him if I had ever lied to him and if he had any reason to think I was lying, he started talking over me and set a minute long timer on his phone for me to offer him the money or leave his car.

I spent the minute trying to persuade him that I wouldn't bring it up, but he simply plugged his ears and said lalalalala like a child because he was operating in bad faith and so angry over the club that he had put resolving this peacefully out of the question. When the minute was up, he demanded I get out, so I said fine, and started to gather my things, but like a second after I said that, I heard Talin mumble something angrily, and leave the car to approach my side, then he forcefully dragged me out of the car onto the ground of my driveway as I was getting out on my own, and told him that.

I told Talin that this behavior was not normal in the slightest because I was already getting out on my own, but he then backed me up against the short wall of a two story drop at my house, clenched his fists together, looked me up and down, and told me how much he wanted to hurt me and was going to hurt me. I am short and out of shape, and he is tall and very athletic, plus he was so angry and acting in such a way I had never seen before that I was terrified that he might push me over the ledge or seriously hurt me to the point that my legs were shaking.

**the Attack**

As he continued looking me up and down, intimidating me, clenching his fists together, and approaching closer and closer to me as I was backed up against the drop, I tried to talk him down and tell him that if he just calmed down he wouldn't want to hurt my anymore, but he just told me that my talking made him want to hurt me even more, and he then did. He grabbed me and shoved me to the ground and attacked me for a while before insulting me and leaving. All on my driveway under the watch of my dad's security camera.

I wasn't too badly hurt, but I was very shaken and terrified as I hobbled downstairs to my kitchen. Talin then texted me, saying that I should pretend that what just happened never happened, otherwise it'd be 'mutual self destruction.' I talked to my mom about it, and she got the security camera footage with my dad, then my mom attached it to an email with my side of what happened, and sent it to Talin's mom. She replied later and sounded somewhat understanding, but I highly doubt she punished Talin or was too mad at him.

I then discussed removing Talin's rank with the club advisor, and when he wanted a reason, I gave him the whole story, how he wasn't helping, how he was lying and blackmailing, and how he attacked me. Even though this happened on a saturday at my house, he involved the school admin, who met with talin and I separately, but I convinced them not to get involved because this was out of their juridiction

**Aftermath**

All of a sudden, Lime started texting me about how I am a liar and only seek to get revenge on Talin. He was very very hostile like nothing he'd ever acted like before, and I tried to reason with him and understand what was going on, but he told me there was nothing I could ever say to him that he'd believe, and that he feels used and he hates being lied to.

I guess that is a response to how I wanted his support in removing Talin from the club (I forgot that I didn't need the VPs' approval, so I went to him for support), and he asked me again and again if I wanted to get revenge on Talin, but after I said that I didn't want to get revenge for like the fifth time, and he kept on asking, I told him I'd stop answering again and again. He told me he was worried of what I might do to him, and when I asked what he was thinking of, he replied ""you tell me."" This is an obvious response to him believing what the racist, homophobic, knife wielding, drug dealing nazi said about me, about how I supposedly made an attempt to kill him but failed (more details in long background, but it was all a lie mostly because he didn't like me and thought I was weird).

I was disappointed that two years later, Lime still believed him, especially since Dillon used to bully Lime and call him a fat loser (Lem isn't even out of shape, Mat is just a very athletic school). Lime then tried to scare me into showing him the private gmail I sent to the club advisor, which I already told him was just me detailing what happened, but since he was acting the way he did and was operating in bad faith, I refused to show him, and told him I would if he would just start acting more reasonable. He told me he had 'concrete proof' that I was lying (I literally have a security camera video of talin attacking me), and that I was in a tough situation and the only way out was to show him the gmail, and in response to this, his intentions were very clearly malicious and there was nothing I could say to sway him, so I stopped texting him.

We then had our next meeting, using Talin's chatgpt experiment. I checked the slides that they had over four weeks to do, the night before the meeting, and found out that they weren't even started. I told Bradley this, and he made a bs excuse and started and finished them with chatgpt (I specifically told him to never use chatgpt for chem club stuff since it always makes mistakes) the day of the meeting. The experiment was a complete failure, the instructions didn't include any concentrations, and the one measurement it had was for sodium hydroxide, which it demanded 5 grams of. Sodium hydroxide is a liquid, and is measured in milliliters. The instructions were completely senseless and the experiment did not work at all. When I confronted Bradley about this, he got very mad and defensive.

I then texted Talin for the first time since the attack so I could try and resolve what Lime was saying, and he tried to take me for a fool and act like he had no idea what was going on (Lime was angrily demanding I show him a gmail that had nothing to do with him, but did include Talin, and Lem and I had no fights up until this sudden extreme hostility, he is Talin's close friend now and doesn't hang out with me anymore, and this all happened because of talin's attack), and only wanted to talk about what he and I's future would be.

I told him I'd discuss our future after the issue with Lime was resolved, since it clearly only happened because of Talin, and if Talin told Lime to stand down, he definitely would, but Talin kept on dodging and dodging, finally admitting that he felt he has no reason to talk to me at all if we wouldn't be friends, even though he failed to do his duties in chem club and literally came to my house uninvited to intimidate and attack me, and Lime was going all hostile and crazy because of him. From my pov, even if you aren't friends with someone, if you wrong someone for no reason and cause a lot of problems in their life, you help fix what you did. And after the shit Talin pulled, I want nothing to do with him, and for good reason. He literally fucking attacked me!

I tried to get him to discuss Lime and what he did, but he kept on dodging and made it very clear that he instructed Lime and lied to him to make him act the way he did. As I tried to talk about fixing the mess Talin caused, he'd keep on texting the same line over me again and again, ""What are future looks like"" again and again. I finally told him about how shitty his actions were, but he kept on trying to downplay and justify what he did- he made. He even said ""well what if you stabbed me with a knife?"" As if HE didn't attack ME and as if I had any knives or would be willing to hurt someone. He made it very very clear that he took no responsibility for his actions, and he actually seems to blame ME for what happened. He also told me that Brad and everyone hate me right now, which I believe, since Brad has been ghosting me.

**Isolation**

I have no friends at all right now, and the next chem club meeting is 6 days from now and we have had over a week to prepare so far, yet I am the only one to have found an experiment. I even gave chem club leadership a good source to use, Royal Society of Chemistry, but still, not even a response. When I showed them my experiment suggestion, Brad said it was very good and he'd try to find something too, and yet here we are, a week later, zero acknowledgement from any of them. Lime's mom actually randomly met with my mom at a coffee shop to discuss Lime and what happened, and she apparently said that she doesn't expect Lime to ever put in any work, and she even called her son an idiot. So far, all of the adults have been on my side, and all of the minors (who all happen to be Talin's friends and have grown up with him) are on Talin's side. She also told my mom that she is grateful for me since Lime was lost after quarantine, and I apparently pulled him out of a deep pit he was in. Strange, since he always treated me like he was doing me a favor by being my friend and I was lucky to have him.

I have a chemistry club to run and STILL nothing has changed and no one is even acknowledging me. I have no friends, and no one to talk to. I missed like 12 days of school in the last month, and have been very far behind in school and very depressed. I have no idea what the fuck is happening and what the fuck to do anymore. Please advise me.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**TL;DR:** I started my school's chemistry club and made my friends vice presidents at their request, but none of them were helping at all, or even acknowledging my requests for their assistance. I confronted them, and demanded they start helping before they lose their ranks, and this led one of the three VPs, my best friend and only real friend at the time, to go to my house uninvited, and intimidate and attack me, seem by my dad's security camera. He has since taken no responsibility for his actions and has turned everyone against me. I removed him from chem club leadership, but still, no one besides me is lifting a finger for the club, and the attacker has now turned them all against me. I need help. I have no friends. Talin has manipulated everyone against me.

Recently I've been feeling like my clothes are getting tighter and I desperately want to tone up/feel skinny again... I feel like my eating/lifestyle is already healthy, so I don't know where to begin. I do 30-ish minutes of pilates or light weight training 3-4 times a week, and usually walk around 5-8,000 steps every day. Start and end my morning with red light, get as much sun as possible (difficult in winter). I work and go to school full time, so maybe stress is causing the water retention/weight gain? And I end up having to eat on the go a lot of the time.  I ususally sleep around 7 hours per night, but lately have been guilty of staying up past midnight on my computer when I know I should be sleeping... Also  I've been feeling super bloated after everything I eat and have only been having bowel movements every other day-ish. So I know something is up, it's just strange because I don't feel I've really changed any of my habits.  

Routine is usually: 

San pellegrino, progest-e during luteal, 3-400 mg magnesium glycinate, 1-200 mg thiamine hcl daily

breakfast: coffee with cane sugar, splash of half and half, and vital proteins collagen powder, and OJ with gelatin. sometimes a siggi's yogurt with bee pollen/fruit or scrambled eggs with feta if there's time. 

eaten throughout the day: dates stuffed w coconut oil, a few oz of a parmesan block, epic jerky, clementines, dried mango, sometimes a butter croissant, sips of kefir and coconut water

dinner: carrot salad and whatever leftovers, usually something like oxtail stew w/ bread and butter, or pan fried ground beef with rice and mushrooms, fruit, a few squares of dark chocolate.   ",2,1740111033.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

W2 wasn’t your typical monster. No claws, no sharp teeth, no creepy glowing eyes. Instead, it was a deceptively innocuous, bureaucratic beast that only came out during tax season.

It starts with a whisper: “Do you have all your W2s ready?”

That’s when you know. It’s coming.

W2 would creep into your home late at night, long after you’ve filed your taxes and think you’re safe. It didn’t care about your retirement savings, your career, or your dreams. It didn’t want your blood. No. It wanted something far worse: Your soul—and the IRS’ approval of your income.

It begins by lurking around your computer screen, slowly infiltrating your email inbox. The subject lines were simple: “Important tax documents.”

But there was nothing simple about it. As you open the attachment, a shiver runs down your spine. The numbers don’t add up. The deductions don’t make sense. The W2 has arrived.

It’s no longer just a form. It’s The Monster of Misclassification. It changes your job title, miscalculates your hours, and suddenly you owe taxes on that random “bonus” you didn’t even know existed. Worse still, it turns out you were marked as ""self-employed,"" even though you have a steady, full-time job.

W2 smiles. You now need a professional tax preparer to fix this mess.

The truly terrifying part? The more you try to get rid of W2, the more it multiplies. It shows up at your work, in your mailbox, on every coffee shop receipt you try to keep for your business write-offs.

And just when you think you've defeated it, W2 returns the next year… with a new form, a new loophole, and the same question: “Are you gonna pay your child support Andrew?” ",1,1740110970.0,resilientjenkinsnark,1,1.0,False

  October 23, 2017. It’s early evening and SW goes live to talk about the newest Thrive product, “Cafe.” The girls have had their dinner and they’ve been given their nightly snack a little early tonight. Some nights they get their snack after their shower and right before bedtime. But tonight, SW needs Cece to cooperate and the best way to accomplish that was with food. So, both BW and CC are having a bowl of Froot Loops with Marshmallows. 

  SW sounds a little…put off with her family tonight. It’s obvious she has gathered them all to participate in her live stream. BW is standing across the kitchen island from her mom.  CW is holding CC, as usual. Her family stands looking into her camera as SW begins her review of Thrive Cafe. SW claims the girls wanted to join in on her live stream. She says this kind of thing often. 

  If you listen closely, CC is quietly repeating the word “more” over and over.   SW issues her normal “say hi” command and everyone obliges.  SW gets right into her spiel about the product. In the background we can see CC looking into her bowl of cereal, as her daddy stands obediently behind her mom.  

  “More” CC begins to demand, louder this time. 

  “Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,  more” CC says and hands her mother the bowl of dry cereal. SW takes the bowl absentmindedly and sits it down on the counter in front of her. She continues to talk but is distracted by her toddler and her request for “more.” 

  CW quietly tells his daughter he will get her more, so as not to disrupt mommy’s live stream. SW shakes the bowl and explains to CW that CC wants more marshmallows. She keeps her back to him as she speaks curtly. 

  “OK,” CW says, as he snaps into action, carrying his child and disappearing off screen. 

  BW speaks up, asking for marshmallows, as well. SW shushes her while struggling to get the product open but mutters “Ok.” She checks her phone battery and mentions it being low. 

   Shanann chats at the audience as she continues to struggle with the packaging. 
 “Hey Kendall. Let’s see if this video goes live without uh…having tantrums in the background. Chris is holding Cece at the moment. So we have um…”

  “Silence,” CW pipes up as we see him walk back to his spot behind his wife, carrying his toddler.  l believe CW was probably just being witty here but SW takes offense to it.  She shakes her head slightly and her lips thin.
  
 “Yeah. That was not cool,” she says in an irritated tone. What about Chris’ comment has upset her? He was right. He is holding CC in order to keep her silent which is what her mom wante…..oh. Now I see why she doesn’t like his remark. She does want silence from her children unless she says otherwise. But she doesn’t want everyone else to know she may not be the patient and loving mother she plays on the internet. 

  “Alright, CC’s happy as long as she has marshmallows,” SW explains to those watching. 

  “Chris, you do your own,” she tells him. It’s obvious she is irritated with his off the script comment. Now she wants him to make his own cup of boiling hot, overpriced cappuccino while also holding their rambunctious two year old. But he obeys. Just as he always does. 

  SW sniffs the Cafe pouch and tries to explain what it smells like but in true SW fashion, she doesn’t have the vocabulary. She passes it around as though she is going to let both kids get a whiff but she moves it in front of BWs face on her way to push it under CCs nose. Even though there is no possible way BW was able to smell anything she says it smells “yummy” which is no surprise as this child will eat and drink most everything. We have only caught a momentary glimpse of little BW while SW purposely stands to the side so the audience can see CC. BW isn’t good for content. She was too calm and well behaved. CC on the other hand got the Huns talking in the comment threads with her rowdy toddler antics. Everything CC does is hilarious to SW. At least on camera. 

  SW holds her coffee mug up so the audience can see her empty the pouch of powder into the hot water. 

  BW must be paying close attention to what her mother is doing because as the powder goes into the mug BW says “stir it.” CW hears and repeats her. BW then asks if she can stir it but both parents tell her it is too hot. 

  CC has been shoveling marshmallows into her mouth since her dad had replenished her supply several minutes ago. One after another she picks them out of her bowl and eats them. 

  BW asks if it's coffee and SW tells her it’s “cafe.” BW repeats her and then says in an adorable voice, “Oh! That’s beautiful” 

  SW laughs and she and CW repeat BWs sentence. Sweetly, CW tells his oldest,  “I love it.”

  SW continues to talk about the product and how it dissolves “really good.”  BW hears her and tries to play along, repeating “It’s really good.” SW, with zero motherly instincts tells her daughter “You haven’t tried it.” She doesn’t realize BW had been mimicking her and sounds almost snide when she corrects her three year old. 

 CC is back to digging around in her dry cereal looking for the last of the marshmallows as her mom calls out more “Hi’s” to those just joining the steam.  She puts the mug of hot “cafe” under BW's nose just off camera and asks her if she wants to smell it. She asks what BW thinks of it and BW replies it smells “good.”  Next it’s CC’s turn and the little one frowns and says it’s “hot.” This makes SW and CW laugh. 

  SW moves the cup back to her lips for the third or fourth time without taking even a sip. She calls out more greetings and once again puts the cup to her face but doesn’t drink it.  BW is continuing to watch her mom’s every move. She makes comments about the drink despite not having tasted it. I think BWs attention isn’t so much on her mom but on the sweet smelling drink. As her mom raises the cup to her lips BW says “yummy.” It is quite clear to me that BW really wants to taste this thing her mother is going on and on about in front of her. SW could have made BW a cup of hot cocoa so she would  feel like she is also participating in this activity. That would mean she had to put some thought into the wants of her child and well…that isn’t how SW rolls. 

 SW drones on about the smell of Cafe and how it smells “so warm.” What does that even mean? CW finally gets a sip of his and gives his obligatory approval over SW's shoulder at the camera. SW says it tastes like “mocha and chocolate” which happen to be the same exact thing. 

  SW shows off her Disney mug, asking if the audience likes it. She oohs and ahhs over the drink she has barely sipped. CC picks a marshmallow out of the bowl and immediately begins to demand “more.” CW looks into her bowl and tells her she still has marshmallows. He tries to hand it back to her but she pushes it at her dad and begins to whine “more.” Her face scrunches up as though she were about to have a tantrum and this prompts CW into walking back to the pantry to retrieve more of the cereal marshmallows. CC always got what she wanted or she would have a fit. This really depleted her mother’s minimal supply of patience and so she was given whatever she wanted in order to shut her up. No one was teaching CC anything except bad behavior got quick results. 

  As CW leaves the camera’s view SW moves the phone to get a better look at the inside of her mug. BW leans over the countertop and tries to see herself on the phone screen. She asks for a drink but her mom tells her it isn’t for kids. BW asks “why” but gets no response. 

 SW moves the camera away from her daughter immediately and begins to chat with Kendall. She invites her over to try the new product and also to pick up a box belonging to her. BW repeats her mom saying “come over, your box is here.” This makes SW laugh and she moves the camera onto BW for the first time since the video started. BW is standing on the orange stool her PopPop had made for them. SW prompts BW to “tell” Kendall something. BW smiles sweetly and asks Kendall to come over to her house. SW now has more lines for BW to repeat. Did Kendall want some Cafe? 

  SW decides to move the tripod to focus the camera on BW. 

  “You’re cuter than daddy,” SW quips. Of course she is cuter than her father but why does SW think it’s ok to insult her husband? I know some of you will say she is only joking but when you try to get a laugh at another’s expense it isn’t funny. Imagine the clutching of the pearls had CW said that same thing about his wife.
  SW hands BW a package of Thrive Cafe and coaches her on how to promote it. She tells her 4 year old to ask if anyone would like to try it. BW however just holds the packet up and stares  into the camera, smiling. 

 SW takes over, informing those with auto-ship that they would be receiving samples of the product with their next shipment. BW continues to hold up the package for the audience to see. She shakes it as she had seen her mom do just minutes before. SW attempts to get BW to repeat her but the little one just stares into the phone screen at herself and waves the packet of Thrive around. 

  “Everyone’s watching you,” SW says to BW. CC can be heard babbling to CW off camera. 

  “Say “hi” Herb. Say “hi” Toni. “Hi” April.” BW repeats as she is told. 

  “I just want to chug this but it’s so hot,” SW tells her audience. She raises the cups to her lips once again. Pay attention to BW right here. She watches her mother so closely as she takes a sip. She wants to taste this so, so badly. I feel for this poor baby. She was so focused on food. Asking to eat, or eating and drinking in nearly 90% of the time she spent on camera. This is an obvious pattern even though we are privy to a very narrow glimpse into BW’s life. This child appeared to have a real preoccupation with food.  This is a side effect of her mother’s twisted version of Babywise, in my opinion. 

  You all know I could talk about Babywise all day but it will have to wait. 

  SW notices BW watching her closely and she offers her child another sniff of the cup. BW looks at the mug so longingly and asks again if she could have a drink. 

  “No, it’s hot, baby,” SW tells her. BW stumbles on her words as she continues to ask her mother for just a small sip. SW ignores her and tells her to “say hi” to more people joining the live stream. Then BW asks if she could pretend to drink it.   She would settle for a make-believe sip. 

    More “hi’s” to people she does not know or had ever met. BW repeats whatever her mother says. She likes to make her mom happy. 

  Next SW tells BW to let the audience know what she did at school today but then changes the subject to what BW would be for Halloween.  BW announces she is going to be a mermaid and she was also going to have a mermaid themed birthday and would wear a mermaid crown to celebrate her day. 

  Someone on the live stream admires BW’s shirt and this prompts SW to draw attention to the Lularoe blouse she is wearing. Pure narcissism. She can’t even let her child get a compliment without needing one for herself. She points out Minnie Mouse on her sleeve. 

  More “say hi” to the huns watching. BW is animated which tickles her mom, who declares “She’s a mess. I’m going to keep her on my lives.” 

  SW remembers why she has started the live stream and mentions Cafe but BW has taken a bite of her Froot Loops and leans in close to the camera.  BW mimics what she has seen CC do many, many times and opens her mouth to show her food.  SW has take  dozens of photos of CC posing for the camera with her open mouth full of food.  BW is trying to get her mothers admiration like her baby sister so easily does.  

  But SW doesn't like it when BW does it and she scolds BW immediately.  BW however, doesn't think she's being serious.  Why would mommy want her to stop when she encourages CC to do the same thing?  

BW doesn’t stop and she's told “That’s not nice” and “That’s not ladylike.” 

 SW holds her hand up in front of BW’s face trying to stop her daughter from embarrassing her. That’s the thing about SW and the difference in the way she treats her children. What was good for CC was not good for BW. If CC wants more marshmallows, she gets more marshmallows. If BW wants more marshmallows, she’s told she’s had enough. 

  While SW is trying to get BW to close her mouth on camera. CC has been whining non-stop in the background. CW can be heard quietly talking to his youngest child, trying to keep her calm for the rest of this live stream. She wants to get down and join her mom and sister at the counter but CW has been told to hold her. She fusses and whines. 

  BW begins to taunt her mom a little bit with the marshmallow hanging off of her tongue. She tries to get closer to the camera and puts her knee on the countertop. SW is reading the comments as BW acts out more and more. 

  “You’re losing audience like that,” SW says to her 3 ½ year old child. 

  “It’s true,” her father says from just off camera. SW giggles.

  “CC will bring them back,” CW adds. 

  So, yeah. Everyone in the house is aware CC is the star of SW’s show. The more whiny, demanding and ill-behaved she was, the more people tuned into watch. 

 SW had fostered competition between her daughters since way back at the beginning of her “Thrive Experience.” She posted about their fights and fusses over who was getting held while taking a break from being in their bedrooms.  Her live streams show an obvious difference in the way she parented her girls.  

The truth was in her actions. She openly used praise and attention in order to manipulate her girls into competing for her approval. All to fuel her own ego and her sense of superiority. 
  The devil is in the details and after studying SW’s hundreds of Facebook videos and posts, I can see how much she needed to dominate everyone in her life and especially her children. Here BW is responding to her mother’s preference for her sister’s antics after SW said “I think I’ll keep her on my lives.” 

  It was probably the first time BW had ever heard her mother choose her to prop up in front of the camera. It was CC that made her mom feel popular on social media.” CC did this with her drill today. CC fell and busted her lip today. CC is deathly allergic to all tree nuts today.” Post. Post. Post.  Etc. Etc. 

  BW has heard her mom say she was going to start using her for her important videos (must have seemed important to BW. It was something her mom spent time orchestrating everyday and cared a lot about). Now she needs to turn on the charm but she looks to her baby sister for inspiration and it’s a bust with her mom.  Her dad even mentions having to put CC on the camera because the audience doesn’t like BW. Sheesh. I can’t stand these two people. Worst parents ever. 

  “Bella, I’m turning the camera,” SW threatens her as she turns the tripod. 

  “No,” BW sits up straight and closes her mouth. Her mom tells her to “Be good.” 

  Back to business. SW gives the orders to BW. BW repeats the order to the audience. BW is adorable here and her mom decides to capitalize on it. SW asks if BW wanted to count in spanish for the people watching and BW agrees. She does it perfectly and then goes back to eating her snack. 

  SW tells her it’s time to say “bye” and CC can be heard behind the camera saying “more” once again. SW says the little one is  “eating all of our food in the kitchen” and then turns the camera around where CW is standing with CC still in his arms. As soon as SW turns her attention toward CC she starts to kick and whine and throw her head and neck back. CW holds on  tighter and tries to soothe her into cooperating for a few more minutes. SW calls out for her toddler to say “hi” but this gets a negative reaction from the toddler. She jerks herself around while CW continues to hold her. 

  SW turns the camera back on herself and announces “That’s CC. Fun, CC.” 

 We know. Everyone knows. Pay attention to your child and take her from your husband. Give him a break. He’s worked all day. Now he has to hold his squirming, pissed off child because she wouldn’t take her off his hands. God forbid he put CC down and let her run amok during her mother’s boring video.  Weird household. 

 “Alright guys, seriousness now,” she says and holds up the Cafe packet. She gives another quick spiel about the new product. She mentions Sara Nudd who is in the chat and says she should be seeing her soon because they had an “adult playdate” scheduled. She says Thrive Cafe is amazing but she has barely touched her lips to the drink. I’m not sure how she tasted it. She tells CW to give her the box so she can read the product details to those watching. 

  BW interrupts by handing her bowl of Froot Loops to her mom, saying she doesn’t want anymore. SW takes the bowl and shushes her. She continues with the nutritional information from the packaging. She brags about the product having vitamins coffee doesn’t have while holding the box up to the camera. CC is still whining. BW is tired and she has stretched herself out across the countertop. SW announces that it’s time for the kids to go to bed and the camera turns toward BW, sucking her thumb. The sunlight is streaming in the sliding glass door behind her. 

SW jokes about the kids running out of “Thrive K” being the reason why they are so whiny and tired. By the light outside I would guess it wasn’t yet 5 pm and both girls had already been fed dinner and a snack and were now going to get showers and popped into bed. All before 5:30. It looks like they already had their “yucky.”


SW was looking forward to drinking the rest of her Cafe and enjoying her “me” time. Goodnight everybody

I don’t know how long Network Café had been running—probably over a decade—but I joined it last year, and it was one of the best things about my uni life. Every Tuesday, you could just walk into the café area in Building 6, grab a free coffee voucher, meet international students from all over the world, play board games, and just have a great time.

If you attended more than 10 sessions, you even got a free Opera House tour ticket! I won one last semester, but honestly, it was never about the coffee or the free tickets—it was about the connections. The friends I made there? We still hang out. It gave me something to look forward to every week in the middle of a stressful semester.

Now? They changed everything. It’s on Wednesdays now, the coffee isn’t great, the vibe is off, and worst of all—no Opera House tour. It’s lost its charm.

Those who were there last semester know how good it was. UTS, if you're listening—please bring back the old Network Café!



TL;DR: UTS changed Network Café from Tuesdays in Building 6 (with great vibes, free coffee vouchers, board games, and an Opera House tour reward) to Wednesdays with bad coffee, no fun, and no tour. It’s lost its charm. UTS, bring back the old Network Café!

2- Holy step of 2 cm. It does not climb that. Unfortunately this was the main reason I bought this device and it failed. You can see in the video many unsuccessful attempts.

1iuhxij,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1iuhxij/employers_wont_give_us_our_paychecks/,Employers won’t give us our paychecks,"I hope I can get some insight here. Sorry for the long post but I feel context is needed. So I worked for a Gelato shop back in 2023. The experience in itself was enough to get me to quit after a week. However when I came to pick up my paycheck (because for some reason this place doesn’t offer direct deposit) and it wasn’t there. I emailed the owners as it’s a small business and their chain of command was pretty unorganized. I got an email back asking for my hours and letting me know a check would be sent out. Well, I had to harass them for what would be marked two years this month Feb 2025. They finally wrote me a check. This isn’t even the beginning. This place issues checks every other friday and they’re mailed to a specific location at 4pm. However if they are delivered early, they insist nobody is allowed to get their check until 430pm. Since it’s obviously ridiculous that people have to wait even though checks get delivered sooner most people pick them up as soon as they are delivered and nobody has had any issues depositing before 430pm. Apologies for the long context but here’s the issue; Since people pick up their checks early the owners have made it a point to give every employees checks to a manager in a completely separate business they also own (a coffee shop) and expressed to said store manager that she is not allowed to give anyone their checks until 430. This is insane right? Please tell me how I can go about this. These people have taken advantage of my partner, friends and I who all work/worked there. Advice is appreciated and honestly.. desperately needed. I’m in Arizona if that helps. 

Edit: I’m only 19 and this was my second job. I don’t know if this is just morally wrong or if it’s a legal issue. The manager of the coffee shop has no sort of authority over the paychecks and the paychecks they get issued are under a different business. Is it ok for a store manager of a different business to withhold paychecks? I’m sorry if I sound stupid. Please be kind, thanks so much. ",0,1740110410.0,legaladvice,5,0.5,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

She was expecting the experience to be magical, but it wasn’t because the coworker didn’t want a serious relationship and just wanted to sleep around. He almost pushed himself onto her, but she ran away and called her childhood boy best friend? And actually now writing this I think she called him for advice with sleeping with guys too.

Either before or after that she saw him about to have sex with another coworker.

1. The cards are shipping to other parts of the world very soon! Shoutout to u/Entire-Walrus2516 for pointing this out to me, but they contacted customer support, and they responded saying global shipping will be available in just a few days! This is fantastic news, and I will definitely let everyone know when it is fully possible to buy these if you don't live in Europe.

2. Random card previews on the website. Something I don't see many people bring up is that the website has multiple tabs to show behind the scenes photos, who made them, and full card previews. I'm only sharing the ones we don't fully see in the trailer, but if you want to see all of them, they're all there on the Tomodachi Press website.

3. Werid Inconsistenties with the checklist. This is bizarre. If you see the checklist image I provided, everything looks in order, right? You have all the bosses phases, all canon NPC names, until you look a little closer. EVERY boss phase is mentioned, except King Dice. They got all his minibosses, but not King himself. He gets a milestone and pop up card, but not a normal one. Super werid. Not only that, but Baroness's minion names are all over the place. Lord Gob Packer and Muffsky's names are normal, but who the heck is Greedy Gumbal and Weasley Waffle? What happened to Sargent Gumbo Gumball and Sir Waffington the Third? And they didn't even bother with Kernal Von Pop and just called him Candy Corn. Rip. On top of that, Inspector Graves is called Ghost Detective. It may sound I'm just ripping into this, but this is just minor errors on their part. Something cool to mention in this checklist is that I believe this is the first canon instance of Sally's husband finally having a name! Granted, it's just Mr. Stageplay, but it's neat. 

That's all for now, again, I'll keep y'all posted as to when these cards are up for grabs in the states and everyone else ASAP.",2,1740110126.0,Cuphead,0,1.0,False

Disclaimer: This is my first post here, and I’m pretty new to all of this—so take this review with a grain of salt and forgive any rookie mistakes.



Here’s my breakdown of each fragrance in random order:


Lattafa Kingdom for Men :
This one is sweet—maybe too sweet for my taste. I pick up some floral notes in the opening, and though I couldn’t recognize it at first, lavender seems like the right thing. That doesn’t last long, though, as vanilla and syrupy sweetness quickly take over and stick around. I can see this being great for winter occasions.
Rating: 7.4/10


Rasasi Fattan :
Not a blind buy! I didn’t have high hopes for this since I wasn’t sure how vetiver (khus) would work in a fragrance—and apparently, my nose agrees. It smells very earthy to me. On a tissue, it immediately reminded me of Karvol Plus—yes, that cold blocked nose tablet. Surprisingly on skin, that scent didn’t show up at all. Instead, it smells like unsweetened khus sharbat, and by the end, it settles into a more subtle earthy note that I don’t mind. I feel like this one might grow on me over time.
Rating: 6.5/10


Lattafa Asad:
I had high expectations for this one—and it delivered. It’s said to be a more wearable clone of Sauvage Elixir. I haven’t tried the original, but this feels exactly like what I want in a fragrance: spicy, warm, and not too overwhelming. It’s supposedly a winter scent, but I could see myself wearing this in the summer too. Nothing groundbreaking, but it does its job really well.
Rating: 8.5/10


Lattafa Fakhar:
My favorite of the set. It opens with a fresh, soapy vibe. I don’t really pick up on the apple note—it might be due to the blending of the other top notes—but regardless, it smells clean and very easy to wear. This feels like a safe blind buy. I doubt anyone would find it offensive. Unfortunately, the performance is disappointing—it didn’t even last 3 hours on my clothes, which seems unreal. That said, I don’t mind reapplying, so it still earns top marks from me.


Rating: 9/10
Lattafa Vintage Radio:
The opening is similar to Kingdom for Men—sweet—but this sweetness feels different. Looking up the notes made me realize it was plum, which made total sense and really worked for me. On my skin, it projected like a beast but eventually became overwhelming in a closed room—so much that I had to wash it off. I’ll give this another shot in an open space, but yeah it can be a bit too sweet for some so definitely try before pulling the trigger on this.
Rating: 7.8/10


Ameer Al Oudh Intense:
Super woody with strong Middle Eastern vibes and a slightly boozy touch. Surprisingly, despite the intense character, I don’t mind it—it’s a good kind of ME. It also has a decent performance. I’ll need to wear it a few more times to decide if I like it or not. But for the price its sure good quality.
Rating: 7/10


Rue Broca Theoreme:
Fresh paan masala—and yes, the rumors are true (at least for me). It’s fresh, and I can see why some people might enjoy it, but I just can’t get past the strong paan masala smell. I tried it on skin to see if it changed, but nope—it stayed the same. I barely get any citrus notes, that overwhelming paan vibe dominates. On the plus side, the performance is really solid.
Rating: 5.5/10


Afnan 9PM:
Really enjoyed this one! It starts with a playful, bubblegum-sweet opening that lingers for a while and is super enjoyable. As it dries down, the vanilla kicks in—and it’s easily the best part. I just want to keep smelling it, none of the other scents has such a rich inviting vanilla note. That said, this would be way too cloying for summer; definitely a winter scent for me.
Rating: 8.7/10


Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa:
This is by far the boldest of the bunch—and honestly, a bit too much for me. While there’s a coffee-like scent at the start, it smells very synthetic and not enjoyable. Soon after, the cinnamon comes in hard—it’s strong, spicy, and slightly overpowering. Later, the cinnamon eases off, letting some rich, boozy notes shine through, with a vanilla finish that has a spicy edge. Definitely a fragrance that demands attention. Wearing this in the summer would be a bad idea—but in winter, it could be a super promising.

1iuhoac,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1iuhoac/i_dont_want_to_be_married_anymore/,I don't want to be married anymore,"This is going to read like a jumbled mess. Apologies in advance. 

Like the title says. 42f, raised younger siblings, and then two children of my own. Married 24 years. My life has been spent being the caregiver of everyone else around me. I feel used up.

Husband has been out of work by choice, off and on for two years. Says he is burnt out. I am supporting us financially. He is also emotionally checked out of our marriage, but still very interested in sex. I've been asking him to take me to dinner for two years, hasn't happened yet. 

I don't want to be his ""caregiver"" anymore. I don't want  to be financially/emotionally responsible for him. 

I want to live in a little place of my own, just me and my two cats. I don't want to be beholden to anyone. I don't want to share my space, or my money, or anything. I want to prioritize myself for the first time in my life, without having to consider how it will affect someone else. 

I know my husband loves me very much, that isn't a question. I am just no longer accepting of love in the way he gives it. He is not capable of loving me the way I need to be loved. I have been very detailed in what I need, and through several conversations, he has said he can do those things. (Making dinner reservations for us to have a date night, remembering our anniversary/my birthday/valentines day, having coffee with me before I leave for work in the morning) He still chooses not to do those things. Am I asking for too much? I don't think I am. He seems to think our marriage is fine.

So, reddit, how do I tell my husband that I simply do not want to be married anymore? 


TL;DR I don't want to be beholden to another person anymore. How do I tell my husband I want a divorce? ",6,1740109565.0,marriageadvice,2,1.0,False

Before I could react, someone else picked it up and handed it back to him. The man was so grateful that he turned to me instead and said, “Thank you, young man! You’re very kind.” I should have corrected him. I really should have. But in that moment, I just awkwardly nodded and said, “Oh, no problem!”—and then the actual good Samaritan just smiled and walked away without saying a word.

I don’t know why I let it happen. I didn’t plan to take credit, but I also didn’t deny it. Now, every time I go back to that café, I feel like a fraud. I know it’s not the worst thing in the world, but I can’t shake the guilt.

He can't afford to leave the tedious Triggernometry, because there's no telling how long he would float. His Podcast ""FF straightens you out"" hasn't taken off. 

I'm sure even Foster must know that Kisin is way overhyped for his schtick. Yet he has to sit in the shadow of this little twit who actually seems to believe the hype about his talent, and bitterly derides anyone who has even a chuckle at his expense.

If the two could banter about the imbalance,  take digs at each other -- Francis could claim he's ghostwriting for Kisin, or being held down by him, Kisin could be arrogant in return in a self-aware, funny way. And even if they weren't talented enough to make it funny, at least it would kill that elepant in the room. 

Not saying turn it into a comedy show, but one such exchange every few weeks at least, would really breath that agonizing unspoken tension. Kissin will not so much as be teased without lashing back, demonstrating the ferocity and size of a mongoose.

Now the yappy Master of Ceremonies to Jordan Peterson's stage shows is also one of the sharpest minds of his generations. Foster, get out now

1iuhjtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumprogress/comments/1iuhjtp/dental_health_help/,Dental health help,"I'm wondering if anyone has struggled with cavities while pregnant/postpartum?  If yes...have you had any success implementing new habits or changing anything in diet/dental routine that had a positive impact?  Why does no one talk about the dental changes that can happen when having kids?! 

For context, I have always been prone to cavities. I don't drink soda, juice, etc. I do drink some coffee, some wine, but I love my sweets. Other than some cookies or candy, my diet is great and full of Whole Foods, fiber, protein etc.  I brush my teeth twice a day and floss probably once a week if I'm being honest.

When I was newly pregnant I had a dental cleaning, and had no (new) watch spots or cavities.  Fast forward to my next cleaning about 3 months PP....THREE of the watch spots had progressed to cavities, and my gums were a little swollen.  I got the cavities filled, and one needs to eventually be a crown. 

I know hormones have something to do with it, and breastfeeding does as well (although I don't know what). I also had some acid reflux near the end of pregnancy, and I'm sure newly postpartum habits weren't great (hello eating in the middle of the night, skipping brushes, falling asleep any time, etc).  I also had/have postpartum thyroiditis, so I literally was eating almost constantly for a few months.  I think I've read that snacking can contribute to cavities, so maybe once my hunger chills out it will get better? I'm now 7mo PP, still breastfeeding so I do still snack but not as much, and I'm pretty much back to my normal dental routine.  My teeth should be on the mend, but I'm pretty nervous for any future pregnancy/postpartum and what it could do to my teeth. I have some fear/dread around the dentist and have dealt with some horrible experiences, so the thought of more issues makes me just want a set of veneers (kidding but also not lol).

I currently have prescribed fluoride toothpaste they recommended. But I will literally take any tips that might prevent worsening dental disease.

Every tuesday, we are treated to a catered lunch but instead of having large dishes, we simply get our own plates since we are a small group and some people opt to zoom in to the meeting that we have immediately following staff lunch. 

today, i’m writing about mia, our office administrator who is in her mid 50s, is about 5’4 and has to be at least 300 pounds. My first day in office  was a few months ago and it opens at 9:30, where i was greeted by office ham who already doordashed the meal deal from dunkin’ donuts. she had at least one breakfast sandwich, an order of hashbrowns and a large iced coffee that she admittedly added a lot of sugar to. That day was also our staff lunch and lunch is in by 11, meaning she had to have had 1000+ cals in before she had her lunch. Her catered lunches are always the huge plates, mainly carb focused since she says “carbs are life!” and she always finishes her portions, while everyone else typically halves theirs. she manages to get the unhealthiest option each time, always opting for items covered in rich, creamy sauces, 
deep fried and or devoid of any sort of vegetable. 

She’s very nice but every time I see her, she’s constantly eating or drinking a full sugar coke or soda or some coffee concoction with whipped cream. Water? not so much. she recently joined me and my boss at a work assignment on a college campus and she started limping not even halfway through the parking lot on our way to the library. she requested that my boss (we all carpooled) go back to her car and drop her off closer to the library. when we got into the building and started chatting, she admitted that she’s been having a limp for the past few months and she just has random pains in her leg. 

When we began reviewing files, she also requested that I “use my young knees and back” to reach to the electric outlet on the floor to plug in her laptop. the outlet was right under her feet, meaning she just needed to lean forward and plug it in. the rest of the day resulted in me having to do simple tasks like grabbing stationery from the other side of the room for her. she also took a nearly hour long lunch break even though we arrived at 11 and left at 4, leaving me and my boss to come in the next week to also finish up her two boxes that she left. 

since it was a long and extensive project for the team (spanning roughly 5 months), a celebration lunch was planned for those from the staff who helped out, our accompanying law firm and the university archivist team who also assisted with the process. the caveat was that you had to have come in at least ONCE during that stretch to help review files. mia came in for the first time on our second to last day because she “didn’t want to come in on her remote days but was interested in a catered lunch.” when i asked if she had any dietary restrictions or preferences, she gave me a long winded spiel about how much she hates rye bread but would love it if we got sandwiches with any other type of bread. funnily enough, we decided on a nearby mexican place so sandwiches were out of the question. 

She’s a very nice and caring person but she’s so slovenly and it really shows in her appearance and actions. she’s also so close yet so far from understanding. she has to subconsciously know her health issues stem from her weight right? ",9,1740108939.0,fatpeoplestories,0,1.0,False

I live in Japan, where the power grid is funky and East/West Japan use 100V 50/60Hz AC power, respectively. Many household electronics are sold in dedicated 50Hz and 60Hz models, rather than all being compatible with both frequencies.

This includes the EK43. I've found a used EK43 in great shape for cheap, but it's a 60Hz model and I live in the 50Hz East. Would I see any drastic issues with the motor longevity, overheating, or some other weird electrical issue by using a 60Hz rated model on a 50Hz circuit? I expect the RPMs of the motor would drop, but is that the end of the story?

My understanding is that grinders with variable RPM do so by modulating the frequency to the motor, so my assumption is that there wouldn't be any real issue, but I can't seem to find any information specifically regarding coffee grinders/ motors, and the information I am finding is often conflicting.",2,1740108870.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

The villages literally float on the bay’s waters and unveil a way of life I had never seen before in my travels. The folks here live humble lives of sustenance, having lived off the sea for many generations now.



After visiting the fishing village, the group enjoyed a kayaking trip at Dark and Bright Cave where we paddled through stunning lagoons and cave systems. Dark cave was really that dark as we were provided flashlights for the 100 metre journey. For lunch, the group enjoyed a family style meal aboard the ship with fresh seafood. We were served shrimp, crab and jellyfish alongside a healthy portion of veggies and rice. 



After lunch, we made our way to monkey island near Cat Ba. At first glance, the monkeys were adorable and entertaining to say the least, but eventually they became quite mischievous and erratic. They jumped on a few of the group members and even tried to steal their belongings. The monkeys had to be shooed away by our tour guide. Monkey island was probably my least favorite experience during the Lan Ha Bay cruise. There was a lot of trash laying around and the monkeys, being the main attraction, looked as though they lived a horrible existence digging through the same trash. There is also a trail here that leads to a viewpoint at the highest peak of the island. It looked a bit busy so I skipped it.



Later in the afternoon, our boat took us to a hidden cove where we enjoyed a swim at a secluded beach. With no other tourists in sight, we practically had the whole beach to ourselves. We were also given the option to go paddleboarding but because of my poor balance, I opted for swimming instead. It was surreal being here as we were surrounded by tall limestone karsts while the emerald water stretches out from the white sand before us.



Early in the evening, we enjoyed a sunset cocktail party on the boat. It wasn’t a full blown dance party of any sorts. Just an easygoing social where we were given a complimentary cocktail by the ship's bartenders. That was followed by a dinner buffet with endless BBQ and seafood served in a candlelit setting. It was a nice touch as I wasn’t expecting that at all. As the drinks kept pouring throughout the night, the music got a bit louder and the ship transformed into a karaoke party on the sundeck. We got to sing our hearts out and stargaze under the night sky with our group members. After the fun filled evening, I decided to head to my onboard cabin early to see the sunrise tomorrow. Although It was my first time sleeping on a boat and I found it comforting being rocked to sleep by the waves.



Day 9 in Vietnam: Lan Ha Bay part 2  
  
On day 2, the crew woke up to an absolutely stunning sunrise over Lan Ha Bay, where the sea and limestone karsts in the distance were colored by golden rays. The bay was quiet and all we heard was the waves below us. It was a mystical sight and one I’ll remember forever. We then had breakfast on board, a simple meal of eggs, rice and veggies served with my favorite Vietnamese iced coffee. 



After our morning grub, our boat took us to a Viet Hai village, a remote jungle village surrounded by high mountains. Normally it’s reached by an 8 KM trek but thankfully our vessel saved us time and effort. It’s a humble village with not much contact with the outside world. The people here are poor but they live a happy and simplistic lifestyle. We were able to connect with them (through our guide), who then showed us farming and grazing with their water buffalos. Afterwards, we were given bikes to cycle around and to enjoy some breathtaking countryside scenery. This was quite enjoyable and I live for these types of travel moments.



After the visit to Viet Hai Village, it was time to head back to Cat Ba Town. We checked out our boats and returned to Beo Pier. The group enjoyed one last lunch in town at Quiri restaurant where I enjoyed Bun Bo Nam Bo or Bun Thit Nuong as I remember it in the south. It's a tasty, dry noodle dish served with grilled beef and veggies to be topped with sweet and tangy fish sauce and peanuts. After lunch we'll be boarding the ferry back to Hai Phong. From Hai Phong, we’ll be taking a 4 hour bus direct to the Hanoi train station before shortly boarding a 10 hour train ride on the Vietnam’s Reunification Express railway. This will be the first train travel on the itinerary and I’m excited. The whole journey will take 18 hours in total.

  
Lan Ha Bay was all in all a great place to visit. I enjoyed Ha Long Bay several years back and to be able to return here after all these years was simply amazing. Asides from Monkey Island, I enjoyed all the excursions, especially the kayaking, meeting the locals and cruising on the ship. This might be considered the quintessential Vietnamese travel experience and for good reason. It's the seascapes, the history on the shores and the inhabitants that have been here for many years. I long for the day I can come back again.

**What is Power Signals - The Social Man?**

Power Signals - The Social Man is a dating and seduction course that claims to unlock a man’s ability to attract women effortlessly. Created by Christian Hudson and based on the underground research of Dr. David, this program focuses on 19 ""silent power signals""—nonverbal cues that supposedly tap into a woman’s ancient mating instincts. The idea is that by mastering these signals, men can become irresistible without cheesy pickup lines or gimmicks.

**Who Created Power Signals - The Social Man?**

Christian Hudson is the face behind *The Social Man*, a well-known brand in the dating advice world. However, the core of Power Signals comes from Dr. David, a social scientist who allegedly studied power dynamics among the Yakuza in Japan. According to the story, David uncovered primal, nonverbal cues that high-status men use to command attention and respect—signals that women subconsciously find irresistible.

**Where Did These Power Signals Come From?**

The foundation of Power Signals - The Social Man comes from Dr. David’s research into anthropology, psychology, and underground social circles. His experiences in Asia, especially in high-stakes social environments like gang negotiations, supposedly helped him identify these ancient cues. The claim is that these nonverbal signals predate spoken language and have been hardwired into human mating psychology for over 90,000 years.

**When Should You Use Power Signals?**

The program suggests that Power Signals work in any social setting—whether you’re at a bar, a club, a coffee shop, or even a workplace. The course emphasizes that women respond to these signals automatically, regardless of the environment. The key is consistency in body language, eye contact, and subtle movements that trigger attraction and dominance.

**Why Does Power Signals - The Social Man Claim to Work?**

The science behind Power Signals is rooted in the idea that up to 93% of human communication is nonverbal. Research from UCLA and body language experts like Joe Navarro support the theory that nonverbal cues impact attraction and social dominance. The course teaches men how to harness these cues to create an aura of confidence, power, and desirability—without saying a word.

**How Does Power Signals - The Social Man Work?**

The program provides training on 19 specific power signals that influence social interactions and attraction. These include subtle gestures, posture adjustments, and eye contact techniques designed to project authority and desirability. Through step-by-step video lessons and real-world examples, users learn how to integrate these signals into daily interactions to spark attraction effortlessly.

**Final Thoughts: Is Power Signals - The Social Man Worth It?**

If you’re looking for a new approach to attraction that goes beyond scripted lines and outdated pickup techniques, Power Signals - The Social Man could be an interesting investment. While the backstory about underground seduction labs and Yakuza power moves might sound dramatic, the core idea—mastering body language to improve social dynamics—is based on solid psychological principles. If the idea of effortlessly drawing women in without saying much appeals to you, this course might be worth a shot.",1,1740108286.0,SnouStudying,1,1.0,False

The Lost Woman

She lives in that apartment,
working from dawn till dusk.
Her messy bun is a silent introduction—
a sign of how lost she is in her own life.

The coffee on the breakfast table,
once steaming hot,
now sits cold and forgotten,
just like the moments she never has time for.

Her mind is a constant planner,
cycling through laundry, housekeeping, cooking—
an endless list that belongs to her alone.

The weight of life presses heavy on her shoulders,
but who stops to notice?
Who has time to think about
that lost woman?

In light of our digitization program, Greg has asked that I find a piece from the archives. The following is an account of a trip that my intern and I took in 1983 and remains the most curious night of my life. Truth be told there is an all-too-easy explanation: alcohol was not the only intoxicant. At the time that was not something to put in print but enough water has flowed under the bridge that it’s no longer so important. Regardless of the substances indulged in something transformative happened that night that I have yet to make sense of and so I leave it to you, dear reader, to make of it what you will.

Fall/Winter 1983



I have not considered myself a spiritual man. My mother was an avid spiritualist and so our home was the site of many meetings with other prominent ladies of the movement. My father, like many men of his time and stature, sat on various national boards within the United Church of Canada. We were, to say the least, a religious household yet a rather unusual one. In the end, neither tradition spoke truth to me and I pursued my own path, which was decidedly secular.

However, as I have eased into middle-age there are things I simply cannot explain. I do not mean to say that there are not or will never be explanations of these phenomena. I am quite comfortable with the idea that the scientific process is a resource-intensive one and that the universe is an incalculably large and diverse place. One day there will be an explanation, however it may take quite some time. Religion, then, is the way man has wrestled with this unknown. Despite my religious leanings, or lack thereof, ignorance is not an excuse for inaction and man has resolutely marched forward through time with the help of mystics, priests, and prophets.

The sunrise one Saturday morning some weeks ago was a loud warning to sailors, that is astonishingly red, but truly beautiful to those of us sticking to the land. Jeremy and I enjoyed coffee on my deck overlooking the river before joining the farmers at our local diner for a good feed and an update on the gossip. Alas - I do not remember whether it had been too dry or too wet for fall chores but the bluejays remained bullies and there was speculation as to an inter-office romance at the milk board. For our purposes we could not have asked for better on that clear late October morning.

It took two careful hours on back roads in the Alpha to reach our trailhead which was halfway down a half-abandoned road. The trail, of course, was the other half and almost entirely returned to the forest. Our path marked only by the gap where the road surface had yet loosen sufficiently for cone and key to take root. An ancient rail fence meandered along one side and the smell of fall leaves filled the air.

Before settlement the aboriginals would have seen old-growth forests of hemlock, yellow birch, and maple covering a landscape shaped only by glaciers. Early settlers would have seen the same but I imagine the scale of the project ahead and sense of isolation would have made them reassess leaving Europe. A few years later the scene would have been apocalyptic: mud and stumps to the horizon, land cleared by teams of strong men and horses for lumber to build the rapidly expanding new colony. In those early days even roads were often made of log and plank, not to mention the homes and businesses going up by the thousands. On this day we beheld the second or third generation of a new forest: cedar and poplar having lived and died to create an environment for pines, hemlocks, birch, and the odd maple to reach for the sun. This land has little use today - denuded of it’s lumber stocks, far too rocky for agriculture, and sufficiently remote to prevent commuting to any kind of meaningful work. A landscape extraordinarily well-suited for retreats, cottages, and camps but rendered nearly worthless by the sheer supply.

The camp we sought out was one of many that might have better resembled villages where children and wives were welcome along-side the ubiquitous Canadian lumberjack. Canada is famous for company towns with a few, such as our very own Batawa, still clinging to life. However this camp had long returned to the forest. Piles of spongy lumber and mossy stone foundations where the mill, mess hall, bunk houses, and church once stood. Counter to the rough and tumble reputation of Canada’s early lumber industry, this camp was decidedly different.

The early days of this colony’s settlement were difficult for most but an unparalleled opportunity for some. For those of higher social rank the colonies were an exile. Those of lower social rank were economic refugees and faced the hardships refugees always do. For a select few in the middle, however, it was complete freedom. Land was surveyed and parcelled out with military precision and those with more than a little bit of money could invest and live in luxury and privacy. In those days these were often as not men with theological goals in addition to their political or commercial aspirations and the company town was seen as a canvas on which to showcase one’s ability. Some towns could have easily been mistaken for the Wild West but others were built on Christian utopian ideals.

Abraham Hawley was the son of a hotelier who leveraged his family’s wealth to enter the lumber industry. From there he invested in pulp and paper, the burgeoning newspaper industry, and later politics. Like other powerful men of those days, he was deeply religious. A devout Quaker, he was a firm believer in “the light within” or the belief that God works within individual people. Hawley’s challenge during his lumbering years was that, as my friend Al Purdy said in his poem “Country North of Belleville,” there were none to deny his inner light for miles.

On the surface Camp Bethel is not unlike many of the other camps and boom towns of the area: the lost-gamble of a moderately wealthy man looking to make a name for himself, now a shadow of what it once was. However there is a rumour that Camp Bethel was selected for it’s spiritual significance as much as it’s standing timber. It is, as the Celts used to say, a so-called “thin place.” In Celtic lore heaven and earth are only a few feet apart but there are thinner places where that distance is much less. This was not lost on the Scots-Irish pioneers who flocked to this part of the world nor was it lost on our aboriginal friends. While there is little evidence of aboriginal settlement prior to Camp Bethel it appears that it was a place of religious pilgrimage, perhaps akin to the Roman shrines and temples that were often erected in supposed thin places across Europe. Not only was Hawley looking for a place to make a name for himself, he was also looking for a thin place away from prying eyes.

Little is written on Hawley like little is written on many of the lesser leading men of the era. There was an investment boom in a brand-new sector with little to no regulation. Hawley wasn’t the T. Boone Pickens or Steve Jobs of the day, he was among the many who look to men like these for inspiration. Important enough for there to be record of his life and work but not enough for there to be much. Perhaps that is how he preferred it, at least for this first endeavour of his.

The most curious thing about Camp Bethel is the fire-pit and artesian well in what an optimist might call the town square. These camps were built cheaply and quickly, often with the knowledge that they would not last, and the ruins around us acknowledged this fact. However in the centre of town is the most curious structure: a well-cut limestone masonry platform about twelve feet square with a symmetrical trough on either side. One contained some ashes and charcoal, the other continuously overflowed with water from a passage below. Despite the decay of the rest of the camp, this structure looked almost new and in fact neither of us thought twice about drinking the sweet cold water. The end of October being a chilly time of year we wasted no time building a fire and, given the ash and charcoal, the most logical place seemed the opposite trough. Then we set about striking camp.

Our first day was for investigation. We scoured the camp and forest surrounding it for clues as to what Mr. Hawley had been up to. We came up with little aside from the limestone structure to differentiate it from the countless other abandoned settlements in this part of the world. Ultimately we gave up in favour of some lovely thick steaks, potatoes, and rye whisky.

Truth be told, the second day began a little slowly but campfire coffee seemed to motivate Jeremy more than myself, who was at a loss as to how to investigate the site any further. It may seem odd to find a structure like this in an old lumber camp with vague whispers surrounding it. However it is less uncommon than you might think when wealthy eccentrics and their delusions of grandeur have a workforce at their disposal deep in the forest. This is evidenced by the lack of archaeological investment in our area - it’s just not that unique. Regardless, I was happy to spend a few days in the woods with someone who had become a very close friend. That close friend, however, would not be deterred.

Jeremy began the day with a morning of yoga — an eastern spiritual tradition of meditative stretching and movements — he said to sharpen his senses and receptivity to the energy of the site. It is not a tradition I have had much exposure to but after watching him stretch and twist I began to see the benefit and joined in. When he said he felt present enough, Jeremy then removed his shoes and socks before methodically pacing the site. He claimed he was feeling for some kind of energy. I suggested he was feeling for tetanus, began working on lunch, and opened the rye.

In the afternoon Jeremy began placing rocks and other objects found on the site in various seemingly arbitrary spots. I told him that his feet must have been freezing but he had concluded it was an important part of the process. When I asked what process, he replied that he didn’t know either. To say that I was skeptical would be an understatement.

By nightfall he had collected quite a few objects, some from his own pack, and many of them were now arranged on the platform. We built that night’s fire large and the sky was clear with stars stretching to infinity in the way only a crisp fall sky this far from civilization allows. Aside from the crackle of the fire, its echos on the trees, and the trickling water it was completely silent and the thoughts seemed to melt from my head. This moment was Eastern Ontario at it’s finest and I was determined to enjoy it despite my respected colleague loosing his mind.

A little annoyed with the lack of companionship, around midnight I muttered that I should have brought my mother’s talking board. Despite my sarcasm Jeremy agreed enthusiastically and after thinking for a moment began scraping the alphabet into the rock using a burnt stick. My skepticism was overridden by practicality when I decided it would be faster to fail than protest and we began the divination process. Yet, by trick or by truth, the following message emerged: “SWIM.”

This was the end of October. Nights were often below freezing and flurries possible: in other words the river was hypothermic. I refused and so Jeremy suggested we ask again. This time the message was clear: “SWIM NOW.”

The two of us simply stared at each other for a moment before Jeremy began tearing off his clothes. I yelled for him to stop but when he looked back at me I knew what I had to do and followed suit.

The water was absolutely shocking, momentum being the only thing able to carry me into it. It felt as though the wind had been knocked out of me. Yet  as soon as my head hit the water I heard it: voices. Hundreds of them. Hardly able to stand the water I pulled my head out and heard silence. When I submerged myself once again the voices continued. Then it grew quiet and one raspy voice rang out: “free the goddess.”

The next thing I knew I was waking up next to the fire in my sleeping bag, Jeremy holding me for warmth and trying to wake me up. When I told him what happened he said he heard the same.

This article is, to say the least, not our usual fare here at County Fence Bi-Annual. We struggled with whether to share this experience or not. The mind is a fickle thing and neither of us can find an explanation for our experience. But as the days have gone on and we have discussed it, our resolve has only become firmer. We are at a loss as to what to do with such a story. So we write. Perhaps you can make sense of what we cannot. Adieu.

I’ve been really interested recently in how businesses are encouraging people to reuse or refill containers instead of relying on single-use packaging. I’ve noticed a few places in the UK (Sheffield) now offering deposits, discounts, and surcharges to push more sustainable habits and I’m just curious if this is becoming more common in other places too.

**Discounts:** A lot of coffee shops give a discount if you bring your own cup (Pret does 50p off, and a little independent café near me offers 30p). Lush gives you a discount for returning empty packaging too.

**Surcharges:** Some places charge extra if you use disposable packaging, the uni cafe now charges 30p if you want to use a single-use cup which is around the same as some of the big chains. 

**Deposits:** I haven’t come across any in Sheffield yet, but I’ve heard of reuse systems at festivals, where you pay a bit extra for a reusable cup and get your money back when you return it. I think some takeaway food places are trying similar schemes too.

Would love to know if other places in the UK and around the world are doing this - especially any cool or unexpected examples!

My (M26) girlfriend (F24) and I have been dating for almost two years. Things have been good overall, but recently, I've noticed she’s been acting a bit distant. We were on a weekend trip with some of our friends, and I left my phone on the coffee table while I went to take a shower. When I came back, she was holding my phone, looking kind of panicked.

She said she found some texts from an ex-girlfriend (who I’m still on good terms with) that made her uncomfortable. To be clear, the texts were completely innocent—just catching up about random stuff. But she completely freaked out, accused me of hiding things, and started demanding that I explain myself. I told her it was just a normal conversation and that it meant nothing. She didn’t seem convinced.

Later that night, she told me she had gone through my phone while I was in the shower and found ""suspicious"" stuff. She said I had pictures of other girls on Instagram and that I was ""flirting"" in a few comments. I’ll admit, I might’ve liked a few pictures or responded to some DMs, but it wasn’t anything inappropriate. I’ve always been open with her, and she knew about my ex before, so it wasn’t like I was hiding anything major.

Anyway, after we argued for hours, I decided to break up with her. I felt like the trust was gone, and the whole situation just felt wrong. She started crying and begging me not to end things, saying I was being paranoid and unreasonable. She even said I was gaslighting her into thinking I was doing something wrong when I wasn’t.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. On one hand, I do think breaking up was the right call since she totally violated my privacy and lost my trust. But on the other hand, I wonder if maybe I overreacted and didn’t give her a chance to explain herself. Was I too harsh? Should I have tried to work things out?

AITA?

However, in all this time, I’ve only met two girls. What worries me isn’t the outcome of the meetings but the fact that most girls aren’t even open to meeting or having a conversation with me in the first place.  

I have a stable job at an Indian MNC, earn well, own property worth 4–5Cr in a Tier 1 city, and am an only child with both parents in government services. Yet, despite these factors, meetings keep getting canceled or postponed last minute, leaving me confused and frustrated.  

Here’s what has happened so far:  

1. **First Meeting** – We had a decent 30-minute conversation, but our vibes didn’t match, so we left it there. No issues with this one.  
2. **Second Meeting** – We met at a coffee shop, but she showed up wearing a mask, saying she had a cold. Later, she told her parents that I hadn’t removed my helmet, so she couldn’t see me properly—something that didn’t happen.  
3. **Last-Minute Cancellations** – A few girls initially agreed to meet, but they backed out at the last moment without any clear reason.  
4. **December 26 Meeting** – A meeting was planned at her house, but on December 25, her father called to say she couldn’t get leave from work. He said he’d get back with a new date, but nothing has happened since. Meanwhile, she keeps viewing my LinkedIn profile daily.  
5. **A Girl I Really Liked** – I came across a profile on a matrimonial site and really liked it. Coincidentally, her father saw my profile and reached out to my parents. After 20 days, as per astrology a meeting was scheduled. Her father initially asked my family to visit their home, but as me and parents stay in a different city, my family suggested me to go alone meeting at a restaurant instead. Jus before 2 days, he called to say she had gone to Pune and wouldn’t make it on time, so the meeting was postponed. I had a feeling this wasn’t the real reason.  
   - I had connected with her on LinkedIn and Instagram, but when I messaged her on Insta, she immediately gave me her father’s number and asked me to speak to him instead. She didn’t engage beyond that.  

I understand that talking and getting rejected (or rejecting someone) is part of the process. But these last-minute cancellations and complete drop-offs without explanation are demoralizing.  

I still feel strongly about the fourth girl, but my parents are firm that unless her family reaches out again, they won’t take further steps.  

At this point, I really don’t understand what girls or their families are looking for. Any thoughts? Any DM to motivate or support me morally are welcome 🙏 ",2,1740107058.0,ArrangeMarrigeDilemma,1,1.0,False

That is why they call Economics the ""Dismal"" Science, these guys are almost always wrong. 1) there is no indication that 100s of thousands of jobs will be cut.  2) There is no private sector uncertainty. Everything Trump is doing is pro-economic growth. Lower taxes, fewer regulatory compliance costs and lower energy prices. In addition the DOGE cost savings will reduce the deficit and take inflation pressure off the economy. 3) Trump's extending the Tax Cuts is non-inflationary and pro-growth. Economic growth will also lower interest rates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1iu0707/economist_warns_that_elon_musk_is_about_to_cause/mdtjutx/)

[I think what Trump and Musk are doing is brave, dangerous, bad short-term, good long-term. Whatever they do, they won't cause a recession, but trigger it. Recession is being held back by a hair. They didn't create it, it was being created for the past years/decades. There is no good way out of it, it is going to happen sooner or later. They aren't only letting some people go but also preventing throwing money outside of the country. These people will find new jobs, the new money will be spent inside the US. Let's get some popcorn and watch. Nobody knows what will actually happen, the economy is very complex and they are poking it from all sides, which is impossible to predict.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I can make my coffee and enjoy it in the mornings. Do my face cleansing routine at night and apply twenty face products without rushing. Drive. Cook. Etc. 

There are no wires. It fits into my regular nursing bras. And I'm getting more milk than I was with my regular pump (granted it was a fairly weak pump in style Medela). Granted I'm more also pumping for longer because I'm so mobile.

I used to be a dick joke comic, now I'm in a deadened sales career and I need to get out. I need ideas.*

I can hear my dad responding to this thread title in my head, ""I'll tell you when you die."" Might be a ""quacks like a duck..."" situation, but semantics aside, I'm in a spot right now.

I know these posts are a dime a dozen, hence why I tried to post this with my burner account but it didn’t work; I'm ashamed to be writing it. I'm 37, I have a beautiful wife-to-be, we have an incredible 2 and a half year old son who's already turning out to be just like me, and he's the light of my life, I'm so fortunate. I've never had love in my life the way I do today. 

I'm also miserable.

I work in sales for an evil corporation because, like most salespeople, I fucked around when I was young, and I've landed myself in a position where it's the only way I can make enough money to support a family, or so it seems. One might say I had a ""turbulent"" youth and adolescence; I'll spare you the sob story, I only say that because, although I like to think I'm a fairly bright individual, I lack any formal education. I dropped out of high school, told ""the man"" to suck it, and spent my 20's and early 30's pursuing a career in comedy. Ironically, not very bright.

I made it farther than I thought I would, but living on the road wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Covid gave me a lot of time to think. Maybe too much, but I remember looking at Nate Bargatze's tour schedule coming out of Covid, and it was 14 straight months of weekends. I just remember thinking, ""That's as good as it gets?"" I knew that, on my deathbed, I won't be wishing I played Lincoln, NE one more time, but I'd regret never getting the opportunity to be a father and a husband. And I knew the time away from a (then, hypothetical) family would kill me, so I walked away.

Comedy and sales have a lot of transferrable skills, and sales was my day job before I could make money doing comedy, so when my fiancé got pregnant, I lazily slumped back into talking for a living. The money is good. It's so good, in fact, it feels like I'm extorting myself. I put myself in a position where I make enough money to create a life where I can't function without this much money, and I can't make this money anywhere else. And therein lies my dilemma. 

The other major reason I walked away from comedy was my general disdain for most people. Trying to relate, being a dancing monkey for people I fundamentally hated... suffice it to say, my mental health was in the shitter. One of the last jokes I remember trying to get to work was, ""The hardest part of comedy is believing that most people don't deserve to be happy."" For obvious reasons, it didn't find its way into the set. (I still kinda think it's funny).

So now, I'm in a position where I sell into clientele that are salt-of-the-earth small business owners, and here I am again, relying on strangers to like and trust me enough that so I can make a paycheck. The only difference is that I can't tell a client to go fuck themselves when they treat me like shit. And the amount of horse shit that goes on at this place, seeing the underbelly of what a Fortune 500 company does to stay afloat, and appease it's stockholders... it takes me out of the moment for the people that matter.

I've thought about trying to climb the ladder, here or at another company, but God, being a sales manager sounds like another fresh hell. The idea of trying to find a new and innovative way to motivate salespeople who either are or aren't motivated by money? Kill me. So I'm staring down the barrel of starting over, but I don't even know where to start, what's even feasible at my age, what sacrifices can I actually make?

Don't get me wrong, I've ""started over"" more than a few times in my life, I'm certainly not above it. But I've never mattered before, not the way I do now. I only had to answer to myself. Now it's different. I don't have the luxury of going ""fuck this job,"" and hitting the road in my Civic (RIP), and trying to ""make it.""

I'd love to be a TV writer. (who wouldn't?). But I'm not in a position to make the monetary sacrifice I'd need to - just taking a bullshit position on a TV set and getting enough important people coffee until somehow that makes me a viable director or producer. I can't squirrel away in my basement and write a treatment or a pilot or a blog because, ""I feel whole when I express myself through writing"" or some shit. There's a lot of failure involved with a good creative process. And given my age, and the people I love, I can't fail right now.

I'm not afraid to go back to school. I can work through school. Having eyes on a goal makes swallowing shit a little easier to stomach. I know it's hard work, but so is ***not*** going back to school. So is not having a degree and being forced to work *those* jobs. My problem is, I don't know what to go back for. I can't just go. Someone told me that, ""just go back, you'll figure it out."" Cool, when my wife leaves me 'cause my kid can't eat because I tried to ""find myself"" at a community college, I'm assuming you'll be down to throw in on child support? 

I've thought about journalism, moreover, investigative journalism. It scratches the writing itch, as well as my natural curiosity, and near-obsessive level of wanting people to get their's. That said, as far as formal writing goes, I'm at a severe disadvantage - I've guess on every comma in this post. It's also very much a ""eat shit and hope for a break,"" industry. Been there, done that, can't do it again with a family.

I wanted to be a lawyer when I was a kid. Again, obsession with justice, but that's a lot of school - especially if I'm going part time, and I've become quite jaded to the American justice system. I'd wonder what type of law I could practice. Prosecute white collar corruption? Would I need to be a state or federal prosecutor? Well I think there's a bit of corruption on the state and federal side as well. 

I worked at an adolescent rehab & mental health facility, briefly, as a supremely unqualified counselor. It was chaotic, but it was my kind of chaos. And I felt like what I was doing mattered. But I also live in one of the most wealthy counties in America, and the salaries for anything that makes you feel like a good person seem to be dogshit. 

I like puzzles, math makes sense to me in that I find the predictability of formulas sort of soothing, for lack of a better word. I like computers, I thought maybe software engineer, data analyst, something like that. Now it seems those industries are markedly oversaturated. And it sort of feels like a Billy Madison-esque scene for me to be 37, or when I actually have the degree, 41 years old and trying to break in.

Maybe I'm being precious, a delicate millennial snowflake as I've heard us called. An immature idealist who's being resistant to the compromises the real world requires of a man: moral, financial, or otherwise. Maybe it's a worldview/mental health issue. Maybe I need a boot in the ass. Maybe I need a hug. I really don't know.

If you've read to this part, thank you. I'm sorry? This is a meandering mess, but probably an accurate representation of where I'm at. Lost. I know this is likely coming off particularly whiney and selfish. Know that I love my family more than anything, and that's the reason for this post. Know that all I want is to be a good father and a good husband, and I don't want to be that guy so miserable at his job, he's always angry. Or just judge me and call me a pussy, I don't really care. 

I'm just writing this on the off chance there's some folks that can help. Being that I have a GED and 1 credit at a community college, I don't even know what's out there, what paths I can take, what I can actually do to better my situation. So any and all suggestions/feedback would be greatly appreciated, because the free aptitude test I took said I should be a garbage man or an expressive dance teacher. thanks. bye.",1,1740106614.0,careerguidance,2,0.6,False

Mushroom Toast $24: I think someone orders this every time we go. The mushrooms are so delicious with that amazing bread

Croque Madame $22: very few places in LA make it like they do in France. Here it’s simply one of the best in LA.

Basque Cheesecake $8: so light yet creamy and decadent.

Chocolate hazelnut brioche $7 and scone $5: simple, not too sweet, fresh and tasty

Vietnamese Latte $6.50: if anyone can offer other places that make a hot Vietnamese latte I’m all ears but anytime I go to a place with Vietnamese coffee they only offer it iced so I love the hot version here

I am not even arguing whether Derrick should have won. 

\- most contestants cook what they are familiar with, some go out of their comfort zone a bit. And most contestants cook some kind of modern American cuisine, which is just amalgamation of bunch of different cuisine. No I am not criticizing modern American cuisine, but I am pointing out the oblivousness of Claudia hater. Dorian falls under this case, but she won because she was consistently good throughout the competition and 

\- Picking out what Claudia made in individual or pressure tests, she made these:

|EP 8 |Claudia|others |
|:-|:-|:-|
||Tres Leches (Mexican) |Sponge cake with some kind of buttercreams in American styles. (I mean were any of them non-American style?)|
|EP 10 1st challenge |Arroz con Molotes with custard sauce, Mexican rice pudding but she made it into italian-like arancini ball |Tommy: Creole jambalaya' Christopher: some pineapple rice; Hetal: Khchidi (they were the only ones I recognized)|
|Ep 10 - pressure test |Pork chop with chili and peanut crust (not sure if this is Mexican?)|Sarah/Christopher: peanut butter tart (French/American?); Katrina: peanut satay chicken with jelly sauce (Thai); Shelly: rice wrap roll (vietnamese); Hetal: sandwich cookies (somewhat American?)|
|Ep 13 pressure test|some chicken (citrus glaze) and waffle (American)|tommy: duck fat fried chicken' and whisky marmalade; Derrick: chicken with raspberry reduction; hetla; indian spiced nutmeg fried chicken;  Nick: fried chicken with horseradish sauce; Katrina: peach hot sauce and miso flavored; Olivia: honey soy chicken; Shelly: regular chicken with vanilla waffle (most of these are American except Hetal and Olivia?)|
|Ep 14 pressure test|pork cheek tostada stack and manga salsa (Mexican)|Hetal: tumeric Jasmine rice (indian) with braised lamb; Nick: Tandoori halicut and cauliflower mash (indian fusion?); Olivia: cheddar cheese polenta and beef (italian american in a way?)|
|EP 15 1st challenge |coffee liqueur flan (not sure if this is strictly latino American as I have seen this in other places)|Hetal: coffee chocolate (loosely European?); Nick: vanilla cake with mocah drizzle (modern American?); Derrick: Coffee caramel pana cotta (Italian); Tommy: coffee beignet with white chocolate cream(he says it's creole but i can't find much about it)|
|EP 17 1st challenge |Napoleon-inspired tortilla crips tower with blistered tomato and garlic vinegar (French-mexican fusion?) |Nick: strawberry cupcak with chocolate speckled whip cream (American); Katrina: pear carpaccio (dessert twist of Italian?) Stephen: mushroom sandwich with cheese curd (not sure how to call it); Derrick: pretzel with blue cheese (european) |
|EP 18 team challenge |(with Nick) Italian crap cake, pan seared salmon and celery root puree, |Stephen and Derrick: spot prwn ceviche and avocado puree, seared duck with butternut squash |
|EP 19 first challenge|Grilled octopus, frisee, ancho chille sauce and roasted potato  |Stephen: pan seared scallope with walnut and almond, rutabaga; Derrick: Miso cod with bok choy (Asian?)|
|EP 20 Claudia |Appetizer: tamale with cactus and avocado cream; entree: grilled sword chayote squash, chickpeas two way; desserts: flambee basque poache, key lime flan and pumpkin seed brittle  |Appetizer: Spiced pork belly and watermelon three ways ;' entree: pan seared venison with puff pastry cage ; dessert: lemon curd and mousse, matcha sponge cake |

 So really, if you look at her individual challenge food and others simultaneously, others cooked their familiar cuisines just as much as her. And even if she only cooked Mexican food - which she didn't, as the majority of her dish is not common Mexican food - that isn't the issue in itself because like I said earlier, Dorian is a second proof that you can win if you are *creative within your realm* without having to go crazy like Derrick or Nick (S10). In contrast, Hetal and Subha's food were barely transformative, and even Luca got the same criticism early in his season 4. 

\- Lastly, she *refuses* to take a pass from Tommy in EP 10. She did the opposite of the stereotypical ""single mom"" attack that you see. She got some ballz. 

TLDR: I dont mind people who think Derrick should have won, but Claudia gets an unfair hate.

I do laps across timezones, ideas, identities and forms without actually doing anything; a minor stroll along the path caressing the river sends me to multiple places. I return home exhausted, without anything to urge me to say, ""I shall do this"". Each decision spawned out of endless- endless rehashing, worrying, thinking, distracting. 

Now, at the age of 36, without any real friends, no job, having moved back in with my family, what do I do but die? There's nothing I can find in the forests I walk or the occasional sojourns in the city. I used to enjoy coffee and wine, but now they taste bland to me. Conversations on the internet used to pull me in, but now I cannot stand the draining idiocy that has shrouded it. Nothing binds me; nothing smells nice. I think I am ready to die!",1,1740105839.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

I'm in my mid 20s and I usually match with people around my age to a bit older. I've only gone out with guys between 26 - 30 tbh never older or younger.

Before the dates, I usually text the guy for around a week or two with like relatively consistent responses. My profile say that I'm interested in a serious relationship and like to take things slow.

Most of my dates follow a relative similar formula where we grab coffee then grab some food and we talk for hours. Then after if the date went well, I would always say I loved hanging out with them and that we should hang out again. After that, guys would either ghost me, or invite me over to their apartment. I would tell them that I'm not comfortable with that yet and then I would get ghosted or they would be like ""oh ok"".

For starters, we are renovating and do not have a dinner table right now. Dad got his plate first, and was watching the hockey game, so he ate at the coffee table while I finished up in the kitchen. Baby boy likes to watch me cook, so he was content with me for a few minutes while I plated up my own. 

We go into the living room, and baby boy bee lines it for dad. He crawls to dads side, stands up, and immediately reaches for some of dads dinner. Dad of course said no, and blocked his hand. The LOOK he gave dad, like ""How DARE you say no to me?"" And he continued to reach for dads food. 

I scooped baby boy up so dad could finish, and he burst into tears, arching his back, wriggling to get free from my embrace. He wanted that food BAD. 

He settled down when I gave him a teething toy, and in hindsight, should have put him in his highchair before I did what I did next. But I thought I could hold my boy and eat my dinner at the same time. Bad idea. He reached for my bowl, grabbed the edge of it, and yanked it off the table - tomato sauce and penne noodles EVERYWHERE. 

Oops. 😂 I placed him in his highchair to clean up, and he proceeded to scream and protest at the top of his lungs until I gave him a few noodles.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \
