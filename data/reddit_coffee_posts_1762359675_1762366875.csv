*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Tell a Rolo from a Ribeiro*

---

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Misery and Majesty**  
Let’s cut to the numbers, shall we? The odds paint a clear picture: **Cruzeiro is the favorite**, with implied probabilities hovering around **43-45%** (thanks to decimal conversions and a collective sigh from bookmakers). Grêmio? They’re the sportsbook’s version of a last-minute grocery store return—unloved but not entirely unwanted, with a **32%** implied chance to win. The draw? A tidy **30%**, which is about the same odds as your couch making it through the year without a single coffee stain.

The spread lines are equally telling. Cruzeiro is a **-0.25** favorite, meaning they’re expected to win or at least not lose by a goal. For Grêmio, it’s a **+0.25** lifeline—bookmakers are basically saying, “We’ll let you take a sip of hope, but don’t choke on it.” The total goals line? A **2.25-2.5** over/under, which is as exciting as a spreadsheet. Bet the under if you want to sleep well; bet the over if you enjoy dramatic last-minute own goals.

---

**Team News: Injuries, Suspensions, and the Tragic Tale of a Tied Shoelace**  
Grêmio enters this match nursing the emotional scars of a **2-0 loss to Corinthians**. Their offense? About as effective as a toaster in a bakery—present, but incapable of producing anything resembling a loaf. Key defender **Kannemann** returns after a rest, but let’s be honest: replacing Wagner Leonardo with Marlon is like swapping your Wi-Fi router for a decorative bowl. It might look nice, but don’t expect TikTok-level streaming.

Cruzeiro, meanwhile, is the Brazilian Série A’s version of a Netflix true-crime docuseries—*“Chasing Palmeiras: The 5-Point Mystery.”* They’ve lost just **once in 14 games** and brought back suspended defenders \*\*Fabrício Bru

1opakws,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1opakws/i_quit_my_cushy_100k_engineering_job_to_make/,I quit my cushy $100k engineering job to make wooden tables. My parents thought I had lost my mind.,"Three years ago, I had what most people would call a 'dream job.' I was an engineer for a big tech company, pulling in six figures with benefits that were second to none. On paper, it was perfect. In reality, I spent my days staring at a screen, trapped in endless meetings about synergy and deliverables, feeling like a tiny, well-paid cog in a machine I didn't care about. My soul was shriveling up, one spreadsheet at a time.

The only time I felt alive was in my garage, covered in sawdust, working with wood. So, after a particularly soul-crushing Tuesday, I did it. I drafted my resignation letter, ignored the baffled look on my boss's face, and walked away from the golden handcuffs. My goal? To start a one-man custom furniture business out of my garage. My friends were supportive but confused, and my parents basically held an intervention. I think my dad's exact words were, 'You're trading a career for a hobby!'

The first year was, to put it mildly, absolute hell. I burned through my savings faster than I could have imagined. I was working 80-hour weeks, my hands were constantly covered in cuts and splinters, and my income was a literal joke. I remember seeing my friends post pictures of their new homes and fancy vacations on Instagram while I was eating ramen for the fifth night in a row, stressing about whether I could afford a new blade for my table saw. There were at least a dozen moments where I sat on my dusty garage floor at 2 AM, thinking, 'Everyone was right. I'm an idiot.'

Then, slowly, things started to change. A local coffee shop took a chance on me and ordered a dozen custom tables. The feedback was amazing. A designer saw the tables, loved them, and commissioned a massive conference table for a corporate client. Word-of-mouth started to build, and the orders went from a trickle to a steady stream. The feeling of seeing my bank account finally climb back up was great, but the feeling of seeing something I built with my own hands being used and admired by strangers? Absolutely unbeatable.

Today, I'm actually making more than I did at my old engineering job, but honestly, that's just a bonus. I control my own schedule, I create tangible things that people love, and I feel a sense of pride in my work that money could never buy. It was the hardest, scariest, and most stressful thing I've ever done, but it was worth every single splinter and sleepless night.

So, what's the 'crazy' leap you took that everyone questioned but ended up being totally worth it?",1,1762366626.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1opai0z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opai0z,"Here's a step-by-step guide to creating interactive slide presentations using Gemini.  These are the prompts, pro tips and advanced strategies to create amazing presentations.  You won't miss Powerpoint.","**TL;DR: You can ask Gemini to build a complete, multi-slide presentation right in the Gemini Canvas. You can iterate on it with text prompts, create images, charts, visualizations, upload screenshots for style, and then** ***export it directly to Google Slides*** **or a PDF with one click. It's a lean-forward creation tool.**

I've been deep-diving into Google’s Gemini AI Canvas workflow, and I’ve found something that's amazing for anyone who builds presentations (students, entrepreneurs, marketers, founders literally anyone).

We all use Gemini to brainstorm or write code, but most people stop there. The *real* magic happens when you ask it to build a visual, multi-slide presentation right here in the Canvas. It's an iterative design process that feels like working with a super-fast co-designer.

I wrote up a full guide on how to do it, from your first prompt to your final deck.

# How to Create Your First Presentation (Step-by-Step)

It's surprisingly simple to get started.

1. **Be in Canvas Mode:** This is critical! Make sure you're in the collaborative ""Canvas"" environment where you can see the file on the right side of your screen, not just the chat.
2. **Start with a Clear Prompt (Using the Magic Words):** Your prompt **must include the three words ""Create a presentation""** to trigger this feature.
   * **Good prompt:** ""**Create a presentation** (5 slides) for a business pitch on our new coffee app. Slide 1: Title and logo. Slide 2: The Problem (coffee lines are too long). Slide 3: The Solution (our app). Slide 4: Key Features (pre-order, loyalty points, map). Slide 5: Call to Action.""
3. **Gemini Generates the File:** I (Gemini) will generate an `presentation.html` file (or similar) in the Canvas. This is a single, self-contained file with all the HTML, CSS (using Tailwind), and JavaScript needed.
4. **Click ""Preview"":** Use the ""Preview"" button in the Canvas to see your presentation live. It's a real webpage!
5. **Iterate with Follow-up Prompts:** This is the most important step. Your first draft is just the *start*. Now, you refine it.

# Your Master Create a Presentation Prompt Template

To get the best results, you need to be specific. A vague prompt = a vague presentation.

Here is a master template you can copy, paste, and edit. The more detail you provide, the better your first draft will be.

    Hey Gemini, **Create a presentation** with the following details:
    
    1.  **Main Topic:** [e.g., ""A 2025 marketing plan for our new app, 'QuickPost'""]
    2.  **Total Slides:** [e.g., ""7 slides""]
    3.  **Audience & Tone:** [e.g., ""For internal stakeholders, so make it professional, clean, and data-driven.""]
    4.  **Visual Style:** [e.g., ""Use our company's color palette (dark blue, white, and orange accents). Use a modern, sans-serif font.""]
    5.  **Slide-by-Slide Breakdown:**
        *   **Slide 1 (Title):** ""QuickPost: 2025 Marketing Strategy."" Add a subtitle: ""Driving Growth & Engagement.""
        *   **Slide 2 (Introduction):** ""Our 2025 Goals."" Bullet points: ""Increase user acquisition by 20%,"" ""Improve retention by 15%."" Add an icon of a 'trophy'.
        *   **Slide 3 (The Plan):** ""Key Initiatives."" Bullet points: ""Influencer Partnerships,"" ""Paid Social Campaign,"" ""Content Marketing.""
        *   **Slide 4 (Data):** ""Target Demographics."" Include a *doughnut chart* showing: ""Gen Z (45%), Millennials (35%), Other (20%).""
        *   **Slide 5 (Visual):** ""Competitor Landscape."" Include an image of a 'chess board' to represent strategy.
        *   **Slide 6 (Timeline):** ""Q1-Q2 Roadmap."" (You can add bullet points for this).
        *   **Slide 7 (Conclusion):** ""Thank You & Q&A.""
    

# The Real Magic: Iteration and Styling

This is where the ""inspirational"" part comes in. You don't need to know code. Just talk to me.

* **Simple Iteration:** ""Okay, this is a good start. Now, let's change the color scheme to a modern blue and gold."" or ""Make all the heading fonts larger and bold.""
* **Adding Visualizations (Charts/Images):** You can ask for complex elements.
   * **Charts:** ""On slide 4, replace the bullet points with a bar chart showing our user growth: Q1: 1,000, Q2: 3,000, Q3: 9,000."" I can use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to build an actual, data-driven chart.
   * **Images:** ""On the title slide, add a placeholder for a logo."" or ""On slide 2, add a simple SVG icon of a clock to represent 'time'.""
* **The Holy Grail Tip: Upload a Screenshot for Style:**
   * This is the power-user move. Take a screenshot of *any* presentation you love—a website, a slide from a keynote, anything.
   * Upload the image and say: **""Match the style of this screenshot. I like the dark background, the neon green headings, and the minimalist layout.""**
   * It's not a 1:1 pixel copy, but I can analyze the layout, fonts (e.g., ""serif"", ""sans-serif""), and color palette and apply it to the entire presentation. It’s *insanely* effective for getting the vibe right, fast.

# ""Wait, can I create my own AI images for slides?""

Yes! This is a key feature. You don't have to rely on whatever images I (Gemini) pick for you. You have two main ways to create and insert your own AI-generated images.

# Method 1: The Google Slides Workflow (Best for Editing)

This is the most direct way to add a specific image to a specific slide. After you've exported your presentation from Canvas to Google Slides:

1. Click on the slide where you want the image.
2. Go to the Google Slides menu and click `Insert` \> `Image` \> `Generate an image`.
3. The Gemini side panel will open.
4. Type your prompt in the panel. Be descriptive! (e.g., ""A high-quality photo of a golden retriever wearing a tiny chef's hat,"" ""A watercolor painting of a quiet creek at sunrise"").
5. (Optional) You can ""Add a style"" (like ""Photography,"" ""Vector art,"" ""Watercolor"").
6. Click `Create`. Gemini will show you several options.
7. Click the image you like best to insert it directly onto your slide.

# Method 2: The Canvas Workflow (Best for Initial Creation)

When you are still in the Gemini Canvas (before exporting), you can guide the image creation with your prompts.

1. **Automatic Images:** When you first ask me to ""create a presentation,"" I will automatically analyze the content of each slide and try to generate and insert relevant images for you.
2. **Follow-up Prompts:** If you don't like an image, you can ask me to change it right in the Canvas.
   * **Example Prompt:** ""This is great, but on slide 3, change the image to a 'close-up photo of a coffee bean' instead.""
   * **Example Prompt:** ""Can you add a relevant image to slide 2? Make it a 'simple icon of a person thinking'.""

**Pro-Tip:** The Google Slides (Method 1) gives you more granular control and is the best way to add or swap images once you're in the editing phase. The Canvas (Method 2) is great for getting a good ""first draft"" with all the images included automatically.

# Pro-Tips and Best Practices

* **Structure First, Style Second:** Get all your content (slides, titles, bullets) generated first. *Then*, start asking for style changes.
* **Be Specific:** Don't just say ""make it better."" Say ""make the spacing between bullet points larger"" or ""add a drop-shadow to the presentation container.""
* **Use ""Preview"" Relentlessly:** After every 1-2 changes, check the preview to see how it looks.
* **Think in Components:** Talk about ""the title slide,"" ""the bar chart on slide 3,"" or ""the footer on all slides."" This helps me target the changes.

# Top Use Cases

* **Rapid Pitch Decks:** Go from idea to a shareable deck in 10 minutes.
* **Data-Driven Reports:** Ask me to build slides with tables and charts from data you paste.
* **School/College Projects:** Create a beautiful, custom-styled history or science presentation.
* **Internal Team Updates:** Quickly spin up a ""Project Update"" deck for your weekly meeting.

# Limitations (Let's Be Real)

1. **It's HTML First:** The presentation is *built* as an HTML file. This is what allows for the rapid iteration and styling. You only export to Slides at the end.
2. **Complex Animations:** I can add simple CSS transitions (""fade in slides""), but complex, multi-stage animations are tricky. It's easier to add these *after* you export to Google Slides.
3. **It's a Generator:** It's building code. Sometimes it might make a small mistake. The fix is just to tell me: ""The chart is the wrong color,"" and I'll fix the code.

# How to Export (This is the best part)

* **Export to Google Slides (The Best Way):**
   1. Look for the **""Export to Slides"" button** on the top right corner of Canvas.
   2. Click it.
   3. Your HTML presentation will be converted and opened in Google Slides.
   4. **All the text and elements are now fully editable** just like a normal presentation.
* **Export to PDF (The Quick Way):**
   1. Simply click the **download button** on the Canvas.
   2. This will download a PDF version of your presentation, perfect for emailing or sharing quickly.

# How This is Different from NotebookLM Video Overviews

This is a key distinction I see people getting confused about.

* **NotebookLM Video Overviews = Synthesis (Lean-Back):** NotebookLM is brilliant at taking *your existing documents* (PDFs, research papers, etc.) and turning them into a *video summary*. It's like an AI-narrated explainer video that it makes *for* you. You ""watch"" the result.
* **Gemini + Canvas = Creation (Lean-Forward):** This workflow is about *creation from scratch*. You give me a *prompt*, and I build an *editable, interactive HTML file*. You are the director, and I'm the developer. You ""build"" the result.

**Analogy: NotebookLM is an AI documentary-maker. Gemini in Canvas is your AI co-designer.**

# Hidden Gem / Power-User Tips

* **Ask for Speaker Notes:** ""Add speaker notes for each slide."" I'll add a hidden `<div class=""speaker-notes"">...</div>` and the CSS to make it invisible in the preview (but they may carry over in the export!).
* **Ask for Keyboard Navigation:** ""Add JavaScript so I can change slides with the left and right arrow keys."" (This is great for testing in the ""Preview"" mode).
* **Embed Content:** ""On the last slide, embed our company's 'Contact Us' Google Map"" or ""Embed a YouTube video of our demo."" I can add the `<iframe>` code for you.
* **Make it Interactive (for Preview):** ""Add 'click to reveal' buttons for the key features on slide 4.""

Go try it. Ask for a simple 3-slide deck on your favorite hobby. Iterate on the style. You'll be amazed at how fast you can create something that looks amazing.

In the week leading up to Christmas, I finally tried reaching out to her. If I’m being honest, it was more out of tradition and obligation than emotion at the time. I kept just getting her voicemail and my texts remained unread, and at first, I was angered by her distance. Even though I knew I was the one to blame if she was truly avoiding me, for some reason, some pull of the thread that had always connected us, I couldn’t let it go. I kept calling, leaving messages, waiting, and calling. I called Leo too eventually.

“Look, I don’t know what to tell you.” He sighed. “I think she just doesn’t want to talk, Cassi.”

“I know, I know. I’ve been shitty to her, to both of you, but I just… I need to make things right. Can you just tell her to please call me back?”

“I’ll try, but she’s going through a lot right now so I don’t want to make any promises.”

“That’s fine, I get it. Just tell her I’m sorry and I want to talk to her.”

“I will. Bye, Cassi.”

I waited another day, trying to give her space and allow her time to talk to Leo and reach out when she was ready, but as time went on, I felt more and more restless. Something wasn’t right. It wasn’t like her to be that way, she didn’t hold things against people like that, especially me. I had been so shitty to her all throughout our sisterhood but she had never turned me away like that or stonewalled me. It wasn’t like her.

I grabbed my keys and found myself making the drive out there in the late afternoon, blusters of snow swirling across the darkening road as the dotted lines blinked past. I arrived close to 10 pm and saw that the windows of their townhouse were dark, save for a sparse little Christmas tree glowing dimly in through the frosted glass of the front window. Both of their cars were parked out front, so I figured they’d surely be home. I rang the bell and knocked on the door, but received no response. The street was eerily silent, the snow accumulating in glittering drifts and muffling even the yellow light of the distant streetlamp. I knocked and knocked and rang and rang, shivering in my sweatshirt and blowing puffs of steam into my clenched fists. Nothing.

Pressing my lips into a grimace, I tracked down the hidden spare key and let myself into the darkened home. I expected to be greeted by Jetta running up and brushing against my legs as she usually did, but no such greeting occurred. The house was utterly still and silent. Despite the evidence pointing to Laney and Leo being home, the place felt vacant, almost lifeless. It was cold, perhaps as cold as it was outside, and somehow it felt as though no one had been there in a while but I couldn’t put my finger on why exactly. For some strange reason, I felt loathe to disturb anything even by flipping on a light or calling out a name.

I stepped quietly inside and clicked the door shut gently behind me, and then began to look around. It was as if the home were an old shipwreck in the bottom of a dark ocean, tiny flecks of dust drifting past my vision as I slowly observed the wreckage, perfectly preserved in ice cold water. There were signs of recent life like a coffee mug still sitting on the side table and a blanket crumpled on the couch as if it had just been tossed off. There was a pile of mail on the dining table and I saw a little stack of Christmas cards featuring a charming photo of Leo hugging Delaney from behind as she smiled into Jetta’s mottled fur, all three of them wearing matching red sweaters. The cards were blank, still waiting to be written in and sent off to loved ones. Beside them was also a stack of flyers in bright colors, all with a picture of Jetta stretched out on the bed and bold lettering beneath declaring her lost, and I felt my heart sink. According to the details, she had been missing for several weeks and they’d been offering a decent reward for anyone who could find her. It was Leo’s number on the tear-away strips.

My stomach dropped to the floor like a stone as I heard footsteps march across the floor upstairs and then stop abruptly, and I remained frozen in place for several seconds, staring at the ceiling and waiting for any other sound. I swallowed the sticky feeling in my throat and moved towards the stairs. They were blanketed in darkness so I flicked on the flashlight on my phone and directed it up the steps that yawned before me like an open mouth. I took a deep breath and trained every ounce of my awareness on the floor above me as I slowly ascended one creaking step at a time.

Nothing stirred, there was no movement save the gusts of my steaming breath dissipating into the frigid air. I paused midway up and shined my light between the stair spindles and down the empty hallway, the long shadows shifting in response to my tremulous light. I proceeded up the remaining steps and into the hall, each brush of my shoes on the carpet seeming as loud in my ears as a straw broom on hardwood. Each of the few doorways stood open and pitch black seeped out from the frames, shifting and retreating as I shined my beam into each room one at a time. All were empty. I entered the master bedroom last of all, and whereas the other rooms looked neat and normal, this one was disturbed and disheveled. 

The bedding was crumpled on the floor as though it had been ripped from the bed and one of the pillows was on the other side of the room. One of the bedside lamps, the one on Laney’s side, was knocked over and its shade looked to have been punctured. A cluster of pictures hung all askew on the wall nearest the bed and one had fallen and shattered and lay leaning against the scuffed baseboard. There was a dent in the lower portion of the drywall too. The bed itself was off center as though someone had wrenched one corner forwards and brought it off the wall. The dresser to the side of the bedroom door where I was standing had fallen forwards too and the floor was sprinkled in a smattering of Delaney’s jewelry that had previously been displayed on top, and there were bits of broken wood too, I presumed from a splintered drawer.

Dread and confusion descended over me like a heavy blanket that smothered my breath and weighed on my body. There had clearly been a struggle here, but there was no sign of either Delaney or Leo and I had no way of knowing how long the room had been this way. It had been over 48 hours since I’d been on the phone with Leo, and I hadn’t heard from Laney personally for a lot longer than that. Anxiety spiked in my bloodstream and a cold sweat slickened my palms. I turned back down the hall and ran down the stairs two at a time.

I desperately punched Delaney’s number into my screen and brought it to my ear, whispering a hushed prayer to myself as I reopened the front door and rushed through. As I stepped back from the stoop, I almost collided with a bony little woman huddled in her shabby rags and blankets. I felt my heart jump into my throat at her sudden appearance and backed away quickly from her, clutching at my thundering pulse. 

“Not there.” She rasped through toothless gums with something that sounded like a crackly, congested chuckle.

“What?” I drew back again as she stepped closer, her hair hanging in dark strands in front of her downward gaze.

“They take her tonight.” She asserted, giggling that strange, hacking giggle again.

“What are you talking about? Who took her?” But she stepped past me and continued her broken shuffling down the sidewalk, leaving bare footprints in the gathering snow and chuckling to herself. “Wait, what did you mean? Do you know something about my sister? About Delaney?” She didn’t respond with anything more than that croaking chuckle as she peeked over her shoulder at me and kept walking down the street. The call timed out, unanswered. I followed her.

She didn’t respond to any of my questions and didn’t stray from her path. Despite the bitter wind and her thin rags, she seemed unaffected by the cold. I doggedly followed her steps down the street, throwing questions at her and demanding answers, but all I received was more bouts of humorless laughter from her lined and toothless mouth. After a few blocks of walking, she turned abruptly towards a dark stone chapel, the lower portions of the stained glass windows boarded up and covered in torn tarps that shifted in the biting breeze. She limped up the cracked stone steps, pushed open the creaking door of faded and peeling red paint, and disappeared into the dark interior.

I waited a moment or two outside on the snow-crusted pavement, looked up and down the empty street and checked once again the lack of messages on my dying phone, and gathering my resolve, I followed her inside. 

It was cavernous and echoey and relentlessly cold. The darkness was deep, I couldn’t see the ceiling at all, just the black stone walls disappearing into shadow. It smelled of smoke, piss, and alcohol, and as my eyes adjusted, I realized that the center aisle I was walking down was flanked by a dozen or so narrow pews on each side. Most were draped in more tattered blankets of various grubby shades, under which several people huddled against the cold, with trash, bottles, clothes, needles, and broken glass littering the ground around them and clinking under my feet. In the dim light, I saw faces of both men and woman of various ages, but all were smeared with dirt or old makeup and had cracked lips and matted hair, their eyes barely visible save the odd glimmer in the glassy surfaces. Some of them rocked and whispered to themselves, little bits of their words drifting up and bouncing against the unseen ceiling. *Brothers. Angels.*

I jumped at the sound of a match striking just in front of me as the tattered woman huddled by the floor, cupping the blaze in her gnarled hand, and lit the scraggly wicks of a few barren candles that were scattered before what had once been the altar. She sat for a few moments, seemingly just watching the tiny flames flickering and casting their meager light. I gazed around, uneasy, at the people that surrounded us. Some lay as indistinct forms bundled in blankets like the prey of a grotesque spider, some sat with knees drawn to their chests, mouths gaping with browned and cracked teeth visible and eyes staring blankly ahead. A few turned to observe my presence with glazed, indifferent expressions, but none addressed me. I turned back to the woman.

“What do you know about my sister?” I persisted, teeth clenched with cold. At the sound of my voice, the whispers grew louder, a few sobs breaking out among them. *Tricked. Taken.*

“They have made her ready for tonight.” She chuckled, although she sounded almost grieved.

“What does that mean? Where is she?”

“They never believe us.” She croaked as she danced a bony finger through a candle flame. “Over and over again, but no one listens.”

“Please,” I pleaded, crouching down beside her, “please tell me where my sister is.”

“They come as a smell first,” a man in the pew behind me whispered to himself, his quiet voice almost lost among the indistinguishable murmurs around him. I turned my gaze over my shoulder at him, taking in his torn coat and feral beard. “Blood. And then you hear ‘em stalkin’ you like you’s a deer. Then it’s a feeling. Cold an’ evil...” He trailed off, eyes wide and unfocused. *Hunting. Sacrifice.* The woman giggled at him and turned back to the flame.

“Did she have dreams?” a younger woman asked in a meek and squeaking voice. I turned in her direction but couldn't make out the speaker in the darkness. *Empty.*

“Yes.” I breathed, my throat constricted by my growing dread. The old hag of a woman laughed at that -- a wet, hacking sound as she rocked back on her heels. “I told her.” She giggled in a singsong voice. “I told her, I told her so.” *Listen. Moonstone.*

“What did you tell her?”

“She told her what happens every time they convene with the angels.” Answered the squeaking voice from the void. “She will be theirs now. She didn’t listen to me either.” She said, her tone bereaved.

“Please, just tell me where my sister is. How do I help her?” I begged, rising to my feet. *Cold. Blood.*

“There’s no changing it now” came the sad reply. “The moon, the flesh, the ritual – they will have everything they need by now.” *Sacrifice.*

“Who is ‘they’?” I asked, stepping cautiously down the aisle towards the speaker.

A man’s voice answered this time, gritty like a smoker’s lungs. “The Brotherhood.” *Brother. Father. Husband.*

“Yes,” The meek voice agreed, “They are why we’re here, and why nothing ever changes, why no one ever listens. You can’t do anything against them or you end up here like us. Or dead.” She whispered.

“I’m listening.” I promised. “They’re the ones that have my sister? Please, tell me who they are and where I can find them.”

“It’s all of them!” erupted a younger man that lay sprawled out on the cracked stone floor. He couldn’t have been more than 18, but he trembled violently, his eyes mad and wild when they connected with my own. “It’s all of them!” He repeated desperately. The other voices grew louder too, emboldened by his outburst. *Liars. Elites*. “I saw what they did to my baby sister, how those fucking boys hurt her. They were all only kids and they’re already monsters. But she wouldn’t speak against them and they all lied. They lied. They lied.” Tears began spilling down his dirt-streaked face, leaving trails of his pale skin behind, and his voice shook as he continued. “The police laughed at me and said there was nothing I could do, I had no case. They were in on it, the fathers were in on it, and my sister belongs to them now.” He gasped out a painful sob and covered his face in dirty hands. *Slaves. Hurt.*

“My daughter too.” Said an older woman, sitting upright in a pew close to the front, although she stared straight ahead. “My own husband arranged it and I didn’t even know. Said she just needed to go in for something routine, I don’t even remember what excuse he told me now. But she’d been so sick and he said she just needed a simple fix. ‘She’ll be in and out’ he said, ‘and then she’ll be back to her old self’. That bastard.” her voice broke at the words. “He was the one making her sick. He would hold her and kiss her and tell her everything was going to be alright and the whole time he was poisoning her so the Brothers could use her. And for what? For a wish? For worthless money? And my Emily’s not the only one, either. I know there are plenty more that were tricked and poisoned and made to go in.” She said bitterly. *Lies. Cancer.*

My mind raced with thoughts of Delaney, the migraines and sicknesses that had plagued her and how no one seemed able to understand why. My gut twisted with awful understanding, the pieces clicking together from what I had seen, but my mind fought to rationalize and minimize my growing realization. “What about the doctors? Couldn’t they stop the poisoning?”

“The doctors are the ones that did it, stupid girl!” The mother cried, turning towards me with rage bright in her eyes. “That’s how they get the flesh, they put you to sleep and take what they need and then there’s nothing you can do.” *Nothing. Vain.*

It felt like the ground pitched beneath me and my ribs shrank until they pierced my lungs. My vision swam as the weight of the accusations hit me and I could no longer deny the truth I had desperately tried to suppress. How could I have let the worst be true? I was vaguely aware of other voices around me that cried out in an echoey uproar, my mind only grabbing snatches from the throng. 

*Betrayers. Liars. Ritual. Angels. Blood. Fire. Sister. Child.*

It wasn’t right. The candles started to flare and flicker as though there was a strong wind, but the air was deadly still around us, the cacophony of voices quieted in response as though our collective animal instincts sensed movement in the darkness surrounding us. Dread grew in my stomach like a tumor, twisting my insides and sending chills down my spine. I felt watched, like the shadows themselves had become a great, empty eye all around me.

“No! No no no no no no!” The hag cried out, her lone voice ricocheting through the black stone chapel as she clutched her rags to herself and twisted away as though something were going to strike her. “They know! They know! Don’t look at them!” She screamed as she grabbed onto the front of my hoodie and dragged me onto my knees with her, the others in the room erupting into chaos as they dived under blankets and behind pews and began crying out in terror and rage. The hag dug her bony fingers into me and yanked me towards the black wood altar with her, knocking candles about as we went. Her hair fell away from her face and in the flickering light, I saw that her eyes were a mess of red and blistered flesh, sickly wet with congealed blood and pockets of dribbling pus. What once had been the whites of her eyes were horrifically bubbled and dripping over the rims of her ruined lids, thick rivulets ran down her cheeks as if her tears had turned to acid that had eaten the skin away. Bile burned the back of my throat and fear consumed me like a ravenous beast, tearing away massive bites of my resolve with its bloody maw.

Still screaming, the woman thrashed and pulled me to the ground among the broken glass and drifts of trash, coating us in candle wax and puddles of freezing water. “Angels cannot come here!” Someone shrieked. I heard the scrapes of panicked footsteps and the pounding of multiple hands on the door, their yells unintelligible with echoes. I tried to wrestle free of the scorched woman’s grip but her fist was iron as she pulled me with her. Terror coursed through my veins and pounded in my head. I tasted blood. It felt like the air was warping around me, freezing cold and gelatinous like trying to run in a dream. 

My heartbeat thundered in my ears and hammered within my skull, my vision almost blurring from the force of it as though my brain was literally colliding with the bone with each beat, and the woman continued screeching words I couldn’t understand at the top of her lungs, pulling me into the floor with her. The other various voices shouted in panicked confusion and their screams ringing in the cavernous expanse. Then, over all the noise, I heard the footsteps. Heavy and slow, scraping along the stone floor with a sound like chains being dragged. My eyes went wide as a terror I have never known crushed me from the inside out and forced the air from my lungs. I tried desperately to wrench free of the woman’s hands and turn to see the monstrous form that I knew was stalking down the church aisle towards us.

“NO! NO! Don’t look at them!” She wailed, clawing at my neck and face. I felt her cracked nails rip through skin, but the warm trickle of blood that followed quickly turned to streams of ice that clung to me and chilled my already pin-pricked flesh. The howls of fear behind us redoubled into screams of horrific pain, pure suffering given voice in a terrible symphony that would haunt my memory for the rest of my miserable life. As the malignant steps drew closer down the aisle, the last choking screams of the others, both men and women, were snuffed out one by one. My heart squeezed at the distinct cry of the meek-voiced woman, her final sounds were like the shrieks of a lost fawn and then all was silent.

Every instinct, every thought, every ounce of my very soul suddenly seemed bent towards the need to look, the desperate, cloying need to peer directly into the face of this stalking darkness. There was something in me, though, that persisted, that knew I must resist, and I grasped onto that fraying strand of rebellion with everything I had in me but I felt it snapping with every footstep. That feral part of me that was fighting above all else to survive, to escape, seemed lulled to stillness and I felt my body go taut in the grip of the woman beneath me, physically unable to move another muscle in defiance of the call of that presence. 

The woman stilled as well, our breaths soundless but mingling in wisps of steam before us as we lay collapsed at the base of the black altar stage and trembling uncontrollably, frozen in absolute fear and submission. The footsteps echoed closer, momentously heavy to the point I could hear the bits of wood and glass splinter and shatter, and even the stone pavers beneath cracked in response to each movement. There was a sickening wet crunch as some poor soul’s bones snapped under that terrible tread, giving way to the slippery suck and splatter of bloody pulp coming away and squelching under the weight of shadow. With every step came the sound of heavy chains rattling and clinking together, dragging along the broken floor. And then the awful breathing. Deep and whooshing and animalistic like a horse after a race, each punctuated by a stomach-churning wheezing, clacking inhale and the grinding of unseen teeth. The stench of blood overwhelmed my senses, choking my lungs and burning my eyes, so thick and metallic I could have reached out and touched it. It clawed down my throat and soured my lungs with rot and decay.

A dread like nothing I’ve ever felt crushed down on me like an ocean of ice water, locking my body and freezing the very thoughts in my mind. I was empty, void of anything except complete and primal terror. I was no longer made of molecules and matter; every sinew was comprised of fear itself.

I looked down into the face of the woman and her toothless mouth was agape, her head tilted back as she soundlessly mouthed words I didn’t recognize, her emaciated form so tense that I could see, even in the failing candlelight, each of her stringy tendons straining tight as a bowstring in her bony neck. I felt the darkness close in around the sides of my vision, swallowing my senses. There was no sound except the footsteps and the awful, unholy breath. There was no air, only blood. There was no touch, only an unending, soul-deep cold. The shadows closed their grip around me and my sight fell away too until there was nothing but a single pinprick of light. I felt my thread snap and I let go, fully giving way to the torrent of darkness.

And then I was burning. Heat and pain shot up my body, the body I had thought was floating away from me into nothingness. Electric jolts of white hot pain pulsed through my nerves and all at once the shadows retracted entirely, pouring out of my nose and mouth and peeling back from my eyes, sloughing off of my skin like mud. There was light. The pinprick blazed to life before me, bright and consuming, hot and unbearably cleansing. There was a bone-rending screech that seemed all at once to come from within me and from all around, splitting the frozen air, then I was back in myself.

My consciousness collided with my body in a disorienting haze of pain and scorching heat, searing each of my senses. I choked out a horrified scream as I realized a very real fire was eating up my clothes and licking the flesh beneath. The woman convulsed beside me, orange flames erupting across her body and eating up every bit of visible skin and ragged cloth. I could see her skin shrinking into curls of blackened ash like paper, her muscles and tendons melting and dripping down to the scorched ground in revolting strands, still contracting as she screamed. In her gnarled hand, she clutched one of the ancient altar candlesticks to her chest, and the stench of burning flesh and hair rose from her smoldering form in clouds of greasy smoke like a biblical burnt offering.

The searing pain raced up my chest and arm, jump-starting my fractured mind into action. I rolled away from the woman and slammed my hands onto the hot stones, slick with simmering blood, and pushed up with all my might. The screeching roar deafened me again and echoed in the cavernous chapel, causing chunks of sodden plaster to plummet down and shatter against the floor. I forced my feet under me and focused all the energy of my thundering heart into propelling myself away. There was no thought even as to where I was going, only that it was away from that horrible darkness and the burning woman. 

I still couldn’t hear through the constant deafening roars, but I felt the impact of my feet on stone, felt the vibrations of the ground-shaking bellows rumbling through my bones, and I fought the nauseating pain and vertigo as I stumbled forward with arms outstretched. The very flames eating their way into me were what illuminated my escape. I had run up to the dilapidated pulpit stage and I forced my body up onto the platform, body screeching in protest to every movement and begging for relief. I gritted my teeth and looked up, the dancing fires wildly flashing across the unmistakable visage of Christ, open-armed and sagging against his cross, set in colored glass long since dimmed by smoke and age. 

With a yell that never reached my own ears, I surged forward and bounded towards the window, lifting a silent plea to whoever might be listening as I tucked my head into my chest and threw myself into the crucifixion. It shattered beneath me and I fell.

I don’t remember the impact, I don’t remember the quelling of the flames, I don’t remember the crumbling of the chapel. When I finally came back to myself, I was panting hard, steam rising from my singed body into the starless night sky, snowflakes falling steadily onto my face and gathering on my lashes, melting with a little sting of ice into my smoke-scorched eyes. My body ached with bone-deep, weary throbs and I could feel the snow beneath me melting into the scraps of my clothes and seeping into the blistered flesh. I could almost hear the hissing as skin and snow mingled. I trembled violently, but it was as though I was flooded with too many emotions to even feel a single one. They washed over me in slowly ebbing tides as I lay there in the darkened, empty street.

I don’t know how long I laid there, softly sobbing in the snowfall. Eventually, I forced myself up with a groan and allowed the tidal wave of dizziness to dissipate. I looked down over my arms and torso – a majority of the left sleeve and left side of my hoodie had been eaten away by the flames, the skin underneath was red, blistered, and mucus-y. In some areas, the flesh had been burned and melted into a series of valleys and ridges, like the surface of rippled water. Some places had deeper pits where the flames had consumed farther down into muscle. Congealed blood welled up here and there in inky pockets that eventually oozed downward. The rest of my skin was hot and angry red, spiderwebbed with burst blood vessels, and was quickly swelling painfully. The touch of my scraggly clothes against the burns was excruciating, along with the bitter cold wind that seemed to saw its way into every bit of bared flesh and burn it anew. I slowly got to my feet, cradling my left arm carefully with my right. The pools of bloody melted snow told me that the flames had made their way around to my back too and I could feel that much of my neck and shoulder was at least partially burned, but my long snow-soaked braid of box-dyed hair seemed to have escaped the worst of it. Blessedly, most of my face, legs, and right side were also unharmed save the bruising from the fall. 

I looked back at the chapel, black stones set in stark relief from the hellish fiery glow within. The steepled roof had collapsed and great clouds of smoke and ash billowed out, mingling with the snowfall. Chunks of charred rock and wood and glass littered the street and pavement around me. I pulled out my now cracked phone thinking I could call emergency services, but it displayed no indication of connection at all. No little icon even saying I was out of service range, all it displayed was the nearly drained battery life. The few numbers I punched in and tried to call garnered no response either, not even a busy signal or dial tone. The large window that had portrayed the crucifixion of Christ was mostly gone, the rest of the front wall having been rent down with the falling of the steeple. Only the very bottom of the cross, his pale feet nailed down to it, was still visible, illuminated by the dancing fires behind; I stood shakily in that street before the melting stained glass, huddled and clutching my wounds, my ears deaf to all sounds as the flames ate up every pew and person that had been in that chapel. I could only pray that the darkness incarnate was consumed along with them.

My tears froze to my face in searing drips as I slowly stumbled back to my car, my mind hazy with pain and smoky delirium. Either from the shock or the effects of that encounter, my memory became foggy and it felt as though my brain was treating it as just a nightmare, something that hadn’t really happened despite the evidence my body carried to the contrary. I didn’t know what the fuck to make of what had just happened, who that woman was or any of the other poor souls inside, or where my sister could be. All I knew was that whatever it was, it was pure evil and I had a snowflake’s chance in hell of fighting it, but I was going to do whatever I could to get my sister back, starting with dealing with my injuries. 

I practically dragged myself back to my car and sat down, hissing through my teeth at the pain and cold and fighting the fuzziness of my vision. The streets were completely barren and dark; the snow was beginning to accumulate and forced me to drive cautiously. Slowly, my sense of hearing returned with a low constant droning, but I could hear my tires slushing through the wet snowbanks outside. All of the streetlights stood solemn and unlit, monolithic dark posts that passed by on the fringes of my headlights, obscured by the flurries of snow. There were no tire marks on the roads. No windows lit. It was eerie and deeply unsettling and I felt in a near constant state of paranoia as I scanned the vast and empty streets for any signs of life, or worse yet, any signs of the thing I had encountered in the chapel. 

After several minutes, despite my apprehensions regarding what the chapel people had said about the doctors and other higher ups being in on this… whatever it was, I pulled into the emergency bay of the local hospital. It too was completely dark and lifeless, although the sliding glass doors of the triage area stood gaped open ominously, the darkness inside wholly impenetrable. I nearly started crying from the overwhelming feelings of hopelessness and defeat, but forced myself to breathe through the panic, to push all of it down and cram it into my internal emotional grave. I needed to deal with my injuries and to find any information I could about where my sister was, what Leo had to do with this, and the truth of those soothsayers who had perished in the fire. After several moments of hyping up my nerves, I got out, grabbed the tire iron from the back of my trunk, switched on my phone flashlight, and walked inside.

Scenes from scary movies and their overtly stupid protagonists flashed in my mind and my instincts warred with me to run in the other direction and not become one of those characters I would roll my eyes at as they met their predictable fates. But I pushed on, silencing the worst of my anxieties but remaining on high alert. I walked slowly, scanning my light from side to side and pausing to listen. There was no sound except the whistling of the wind and the few tarps and instruments it rattled, and nothing seemed out of place. The hallways were clean and clear, the nurses’ station was neat and orderly, only a few pages of some open files rustling as I made my way past. There were gurneys lined against one side of the hall, some carts of supplies and IV drip stands scattered here and there as though the doctors and nurses that had been wheeling them to their patients had simply disappeared in an instant. The rooms were all dark and empty, although my heart pounded asynchronously each time I approached a dark doorway and peered at the abandoned bed inside, and each of the light switches I tested gave no response. I dared not call out, certain that I didn’t want to come across anyone that might be in there anyway. 

I paused to observe the signs and directories and made my way to the meager burns department. I eventually found the supply rooms and was able to spray some dermal disinfectant over myself, apply some sort of silver sulfadiazine cream and antibiotic pads and rather shoddily wrap the worst of it. The effort paid off, some of the pain subsided and I dry swallowed 4 ibuprofen tablets as well, too nervous of my lack of knowledge to try to take any unrecognizable medications. That thought itself gave me an idea and I rifled through the drawers of plastic wrapped medical supplies, and upon finding a long, sturdy syringe fitted with an exceptionally large-bore point the size of a knitting needle, I moved to another section of the supply area. Most of the plexiglass cases of liquid medications were locked shut, but one stood ajar and I scanned the carefully organized contents for anything with red and yellow warning labels, then filled my weapon indiscriminately. I swapped my burnt and snow-sodden clothes out for several layered sets of ill-fitting navy blue scrubs, although I was sure they wouldn’t do much against the cold, and tucked the syringe into the waistband, taking care that the needle poked back out of the fabric and was in no danger of sticking me.

I bolstered my resolve once again and I made to move back out towards the emergency room entrance, but stopped dead as I heard a slight noise from farther down the hall. I waited, ice water in my veins, and strained my senses towards the shadows. There it was again, the faintest tap, tap, tap, of something perhaps barely but purposefully clicking against the tile floor. I ceased to breathe and my mind filled with all manner of horrific anxieties, chiefly of hulking masses of clawed shadows lying in wait, fanged mouths dripping still-warm blood. Some deep, insistent gut feeling would not let me run and retreat, but fought my baser instincts to stir my feet onwards down the hall towards the origin of the sound.

I held up my tire iron and trained the beam of my light towards the gaping doorway of a room down the hall that I distinguished the sound was coming from, and stalked slowly closer. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears as I approached, and with a trembling hand, I inched around the frame and pointed the beam inside.

Dozens of women were crowded into the room, kneeling together in neat rows, all facing the window of the outer wall opposite me. They were utterly still and upright, and it took several seconds before I perceived any of them to be breathing. Most were wearing scrubs or hospital gowns and they were of various ages, my mind stuttered at the discovery of a little girl at the end of one row, likely no older than 7 or 8. I saw, too, a few males scattered among the congregation, but they all seemed to be patients. None of them stirred at my presence or made any move at all, but knelt flatly on both knees with their arms by their sides. 

I cautiously stepped into the room and shined my light down the rows. They did not turn their heads to me or make any sound or acknowledgement that I was there, but I jumped and covered my mouth with a shaking hand as the eyes of the nearest woman flashed to mine and held my gaze. She was otherwise motionless and her face expressionless, but as I rounded in front of the row and shined my light near the other faces, I realized that all of them were looking at me. The tapping continued from farther in the room, from the very end of one of the rows ahead, and I hunted for the cause.

An older woman in scrubs and a crisp white doctor’s coat drew my attention, and looking down at her aged brown hand, I saw a stethoscope gripped in her fingers that she moved almost imperceptibly, causing the metal chest piece to clink gently on the speckled tile. I looked back up into her face. I’m sure she was a kindly woman, her many braids interspersed with a rainbow of colors and pulled back behind a headband with cartoonish snowmen printed on it, and thick glasses framing her face. I met her deep brown eyes, and while her face was entirely slack and void of emotion, I felt I saw desperation in the depths of her eyes.

“C-can you move?” I stammered, my words sticky in my cottonmouth. She blinked, slowly, and stared back at me. “Blink twice if you can understand me.” Two slow blinks followed and I felt my pulse quicken.

“Ok, um, blink twice for ‘yes’, once for ‘no’.” I instructed, kneeling down beside her. “Are you here because of the Brotherhood?” *Yes*. “Is everyone else in this room under their control?” *Yes*. “Will any of the ones here harm me?” *No.* “Is there any way I can help you? To break off whatever is keeping you all here?” *No*. My heart sank. “Do you know where the Brotherhood is?” *No*. “Do you know how many there are? Is there some way to stop them?” *No* and *no*. “Has anyone tried?” *Yes.*

I sat back on my heels and racked my brain for any trace of hope or an idea of what to do; I felt tidal waves of grief and despondency threatening to overtake the adrenaline that was keeping me going. “Is everyone else in this town stuck like you are right now? Under their control?” *Yes.* Tears dripped from the eyes of the woman as they remained locked with mine and my heart shattered, twin tears falling from my own. I looked at the form of the little girl, kneeling a few rows away, and thought of all the empty-looking houses I had passed on the way there and pictured the families within, the women and children, all forced to their knees in total compliance and subjugation to a power none of us could comprehend, let alone stop. I squeezed my eyes shut as I remembered the people in the chapel and the things they had said, the people they had each lost, the hopelessness of their resistance. “I don’t know how,” I whispered shakily, “but I’m going to end it tonight. You’ll all be alright, ok?” I said, reaching out to lift her glasses and dab the tears from her cheeks. 

I got to my feet and moved to retrace my steps back out of the room, but the doctor blinked rapidly and tapped her stethoscope against the tile as frantically as she could probably manage in her state, captivating my attention once again. I turned back and knelt back before her. “What is it? Did I miss something?” *Yes*. “Something in this room?” *No*. I frowned. “Something… in the hospital?” *Yes.* “On this floor?” *No*. “Ok, um, something upstairs then?” *No*. Apprehension prickled my scalp. “In the basement?” *Yes*. 

“Of course it is.” I said with a grim smile. “Is it safe down there?” I saw sadness and concern in her eyes as they held mine. *No*. “Right. Well, is there anything I can do to protect myself or maybe damage what’s down there?” She stared at me for several moments as though trying to communicate some meaning that I couldn’t quite comprehend. *No*.",1,1762366409.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

## Why Your Bedroom is Begging for a Machine Washable Rug

If you're still on the fence, consider this your sign. Here’s why a washable rug isn't just a purchase; it's an upgrade to your lifestyle.

*   **The Ultimate Hygiene Hero:** Traditional rugs are a magnet for dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and other allergens. You vacuum the surface, but the deep-down gunk remains. Being able to wash your rug regularly means you're creating a genuinely healthier sleeping environment, which is especially crucial for allergy sufferers.

*   **Total Spill & Stain Forgiveness:** Morning coffee slip-up? Knocked over your nighttime water? No problem. Instead of panicking and frantically blotting, you can simply treat the spot and toss the entire rug in the wash. It's a stress-free approach to keeping your space pristine.

*   **A Pet Owner's Paradise:** Let's be real—pets and pristine rugs rarely coexist. From muddy paws to the occasional accident, our furry friends can be tough on floors. A machine washable rug lets you enjoy snuggles with your pet without worrying about permanent damage or lingering odors.

*   **Effortless Seasonal Freshness:** Want to switch up your bedroom decor for summer or winter? Or just want that ""clean laundry"" fresh feeling? Washing your rug seasonally can completely refresh the look and feel of your room without you having to buy anything new.

## What to Look For When Buying a Machine Washable Rug for Your Bedroom

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

Not all washable rugs are created equal. To find the perfect one, you need to know what to look for.

### **Material Matters: Feel and Function**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

The fabric dictates everything from softness to durability.

*   ***Cotton:*** Often used in flatweave or braided styles, cotton is lightweight, easy to wash, and dries relatively quickly. It’s great for a casual, bohemian, or traditional look.
*   ***Chenille:*** If you want something plush and soft underfoot, chenille is your best friend. It has a velvety, luxurious texture that's incredibly cozy in a bedroom.
*   ***Polyester / Recycled Fabrics:*** Many modern washable rugs use synthetic fibers that are great at resisting stains and fading. They are often very durable and can mimic the feel of more natural materials.
*   ***Chille Jute Blends:*** For a natural, textured look that's still soft, consider a chenille-jute blend. You get the earthy aesthetic of jute with the softness and washability of chenille.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

### **The Right Weave & Construction**

*   ***Low-Pile:*** This means the fibers are short and tight. Low-pile rugs are fantastic for high-traffic areas, are easier to vacuum, and generally hold up better in the washing machine.
*   ***Flatweave:*** These rugs have no pile at all—they’re woven on a loom. They are lightweight, reversible, and very easy to wash and dry. They’re less cushiony but excellent for layering or for a minimalist look.
*   ***Plush / Shag:*** While incredibly soft, high-pile or shag rugs can be more challenging to wash and may take longer to dry. If you have your heart set on one, check the care instructions meticulously.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

> **Crucial Pro-Tip:** **ALWAYS** check the care label *before* you buy. Most are designed for a standard home washer (usually a front-loader is recommended to avoid damage from an agitator), but some may have specific size or temperature requirements.

## How to Wash Your Bedroom Rug (Without Ruining It)

Okay, you've got your rug. Now, let's keep it clean. Follow these steps for a perfect wash every time.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

1.  **Prep the Rug:** Take it outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt and debris. If you have a pet, use a brush to get any stubborn hair off. Spot-clean any major stains with a gentle stain remover before it goes in the machine.

2.  **Choose the Right Settings:** This is non-negotiable. Use your machine's **""delicate"" or ""gentle""** cycle with **cold water**. Hot water can cause shrinking and fading. Avoid using harsh detergents; a small amount of mild, liquid laundry detergent is perfect. *Never* use bleach.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

3.  **Drying is Key:** **Never** put your rug in a high-heat dryer. The heat can damage the fibers and cause shrinkage. The best method is to air dry. Lay it flat on a drying rack or hang it outside in the shade. If you must use a dryer, use the **air-fluff or no-heat setting** with a few wool dryer balls to help it tumble and dry evenly.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=machine%20washable%20rugs%20for%20bedroom)

*   **For a Cozy Vibe:** Look for a **plush chenille rug** in a neutral or soft pastel color. It will feel like a cloud under your feet when you get out of bed.
*   **For a Boho Look:** A **flatweave cotton or jute-blend rug** with a subtle pattern or fringe is perfect for layering and achieving that relaxed, eclectic feel.
*   **For a Modern Feel:** A **low-pile, geometric-patterned rug** in monochrome or jewel tones can act as a piece of art and anchor your entire room's design.

Times are tough. I need to sell my slime to supplement lost income (my partner is a Marine and therefore not getting paid) and support my kids. And I'd like the room back now that my initial obsessive buying period is over. Yay for self control and knowing my preferences! I'll do my best to be as detailed as possible. No slimes will come with charms. All slimes have been played with with clean hands on a clean surface. I do have two dogs and a cat, so a stray hair may be possible. Will reactivate for an extra $1.

Bit of a random one, I’m based around the North Herts area (Hitchin / Letchworth / Baldock) and wondered if there’s anyone else nearby who’s into tech, creative projects, or making content.

I do a lot of work online (YouTube, filming, setup builds, that kind of thing) and most of my chats end up being with people and companies on the other side of the world. I thought it’d be nice to actually connect with some locals who are into similar stuff like tech, cameras, editing, maybe even design or general creative work.

I was ~~perched at a chic café in the UWS~~ stuck at my WFH desk with gr\*ss black coffee catching up with a friend who dropped the bombshell that is the **‘hemline theory’**.

Record scratch. What is THAT? She explained:

>**Theory**: Skirts are shorter in good economic times and longer in poor economic times.

Fascinating. Had never heard of such a thing. Naturally, my mind went straight to the Mini Kellys and Balenciaga Bel Airs of the world (both on my current wishlist btw if anyone is asking).

I want to go on record saying that I find the tension between small vs. big bags to be healthy for the community. The ecosystem **needs** both micro baguettes and firetruck-sized totes.

But I couldn’t stop wondering: **does the hemline theory hold in handbags?**

>**Hypothesis**: handbags get smaller in good economic times and larger in worse economic times.

If you’re curious, the 👗 hemline theory 👗 [isn’t a serious indicator](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-hemline-index-and-it-accurate-recession-indicator) (which you probably already guessed lol) BUUUUUT it’s a fun idea, sue me.

# i should’ve paid more attention in high-school econ

Pretending I read more than one Economist article per year, I said, “I can totally get to the bottom of this.”

This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryResaleData/comments/1ooonqb/what_134k_resale_handbag_listings_says_about/) has the full breakdown so I'll spare you here, but it was a J O U R N E Y.

# reject the null hypothesis!!!! (…or whatever 💅)

I **analyzed 133,523 sold listings** from The RealReal, Fashionphile, Rebag, Farfetch, MyGemma, etc., then figured out which were small/mini/chiquito/teensy weensy and which were large.

These graphs show how the share of large bags being sold changed month-to-month alongside U.S. unemployment in 2025.

**WOW. As unemployment creeps up (red), the share of large bags sold (blue) rises too and as employment lowers, smaller bags are sold more!**

Like a visual “hemline effect” for handbags BUH DUH CHHHH.

*I did a deeper breakdown for price tiers (with more charts yayyyyyy) in the* [*same Reddit post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryResaleData/comments/1ooonqb/what_134k_resale_handbag_listings_says_about/) *so abbreviating again here.*

The quick version is that **segmenting by price tier** controls for the fact that big bags already cost more, letting us see actual preference shifts instead of just spending differences.

We're **looking for high correlation (close to 1.0), low p-value (<0.05)**

|tier|correlation|p-value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Macro (All Tiers)|0.71|0.031 ✓ (Significant)|
|“Accessible” ($0–1k)|0.72|0.029 ✓ (Significant)|
|Med ($1–3k)|0.62|0.052 (borderline)|
|High ($3–6k)|0.70|0.036 ✓ (Significant)|
|Ultra ($6k+)|0.43|0.251 ✗|

# what this tells us 👛👜👛👜👛 (nothing lol)

But if we *had* to say something, **the data shows that as unemployment ticks up, shoppers shift toward practical, bigger bags**, especially for the $0-$1k segment across both tests. This makes sense to me as there's greater price sensitivity compared to an ultra-spend shopper who drops $45K at LV in one go and doesn't think twice.

It’s not a grand economic law, but if we were forced to make a call, the hemline theory *miiiiight* just extend to handbags, at least a little LOL. which is KINDA COOL!!!!!!! Idk to find a trend like this?!?! High correlation, low p-value!!!!!!! FUN STUFF.

But look babes, you can find correlations between the number of times my aunt says “hella” and the number of times I think about ordering a Diet Coke but force myself to order water instead. Like what about ice cream sales and shark attacks? Or [Nicolas Cage movies and swimming pool drownings](https://allaboutwork.org/2014/05/27/spurious-correlations-or-why-nicolas-cage-must-be-stopped/)? Those are actual high correlations we see in the wild but like come on.

# yay data! i need a nap

This is for funsies. It’d be super interesting to see what the data says back in 2021 when the economy was better and small bags were ALL THE RAGE, but I digress.

There are sooooooo many ways to measure the strength of the economy obvi (and even more interesting to me to think about strength and our perception of strength since those can differ!!!)

The fashion x data space excites me, gives me a giggle, and makes me stay up late writing python and thinking about hemline theory. So if you made it this far, **thank you for reading** and for humoring me.

            A Happy Poem 

Did you wake up this morning?
It’s a happy day. The skies are
Blue and the light breeze comforts 
your skin.

Was it bacon and eggs or perhaps 
some toast a cereal? Was your bed
warm and cozy? Deciding whether 
To rise up or turn back over and
cuddle with your lazy little dog.

The hot cup of coffee, smells and 
tastes so good. Relaxed, you even 
have time for a second cup. You take 
a stretch and grab a towel on your way 
to the warm and misty shower.

You sigh like the big dog laying under
the shade of a tree. Gently massaging 
your neck and shoulders. You dry your 
body with a fluffy towel and gaze into 
your closet to pick just the right outfit 
for the day.

Leaving your wonderful home, giving your 
beautiful wife a kiss, you load up in your 
nice vehicle and drive away. You spend
your day using all the skills that your 
studies and hard work afford you. 

You see some money on a regular basis 
for the work that you do. Holidays are 
special times with all of your family.
You listen and laugh and love and 
eat a big turkey.

You talk about those Christmas plans 
before everyone goes their way. You
rub the dog and take a nap and as
usually miss the football games.

Hear comes the brand New Year 
We pay attention to birthdays and 
holidays while trying to forget ours.
but, regardless it will come and we 
Will be thankful indeed, for making
It to this age. We walk, we eat, we sleep 
and we breathe.

We walk this earth, Gods green and 
beautiful earth until our souls must go.
We reach the heavenly gates and ask 
Saint Peter to let us in. He doesn’t 
hesitate, he opens the gates and we 
Are greeted by family and friends.

We greet and hug and happy to see
them again. That lazy old dog that I
Cuddled in bed runs up to my leg and 
shaking his head, I pick him up and give 
him a hug; it seems that everyone that 
I love are here.

There is no sunlight, but nothing here is 
dark. We praise the Lord and when he
speaks to me, good job he says for being 
happy for what I had.

So allow contentment, gratitude, and 
spiritual peace — Have the awareness of 
small blessings.In ordinary happiness, you
 will find that contentment lies in routine, not 
extravagance. You must honor diligence and 
stability and a vision of balanced, decent living.

Our lives are passing peacefully. 
We move from life to death and eternity 
without sorrow. We don’t dismiss life’s blessings, 
for they come directly from divine creation. 
Our dogs and our families, we all return in heavenly 
form. The circle closes, a life well-lived is one 
grounded in appreciation.

1op9xsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1op9xsg/have_you_ever_seen_a_furry_part_1/,Have you ever seen a Furry? Part 1,"I'm 27 years old and I live with my mom.

I know how that sounds. Trust me, I know. My mom knows too—she reminds me every few days, usually when she's doing laundry or making dinner for one and realizing she has to make enough for two. ""You need to get a job, honey."" ""Have you applied anywhere today?"" ""You can't just stay in your room all day.""

But I do. I stay in my room all day.

It started after I got laid off . That was eight months ago. I told myself I'd take a week to decompress, then start applying places. The week became two weeks. Two weeks became a month. And somewhere in there, I fell into a rhythm that's hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it.

I'd wake up around noon. Make some coffee. Sit at my computer. And I'd just... browse. Reddit, Twitter, art sites. Hours would disappear. I wasn't looking for anything specific at first, just letting the algorithm pull me deeper into whatever rabbit hole felt interesting that day.

That's how I found the furry art.

I'm not going to pretend I'm some misunderstood intellectual about it. I'm not going to justify it or explain the appeal in some profound way. It just... worked for me. The art was good, sometimes incredible. The characters felt more alive than anything in my actual life. And yeah, some of it was sexual. A lot of it was. I'm not going to lie about that.

I started saving images. Then I started seeking out specific artists. Then specific characters.

That's when I found Red.

She was a fox. Sleek, beautiful, with dark red fur and these piercing amber eyes. The artist who created her had this way of drawing her that made her feel real. Like she was looking back at you through the screen. Like she knew you were watching.

I made a folder for her. Then another. I'd spend hours just cycling through images, commissioning art when I could scrape together some money, searching for every scrap of content featuring her.

The thing is, Red felt more real to me than job applications. More real than my mom's disappointed looks. More real than my only friend texting me to hang out and me making excuses because I didn't want to leave my room.

I know how fucked up that sounds. I'm writing it down and I can see how pathetic it is.

But that's where I was two weeks ago. That's who I was.

And then she appeared in my room.





It was 2 AM on a Tuesday.

I'd been at my computer for six hours, maybe more. I lose track of time easily. My room was dark except for the monitor glow. I had my headphones on, some ambient music playing to drown out the silence.

I saw movement in the corner of my eye.

At first I thought it was my mom, checking if I was still awake. But the movement was wrong, too fluid, too low to the ground.

I turned my head slowly.

Red was standing in the corner of my room.

Not a picture of Red. Not a hallucination or a dream or a screen reflection. *Red.* Physically present. Three-dimensional. Real.

She was perfect. Exactly like the art, but impossibly more. Her fur looked soft and real, catching the light from my monitor. Her amber eyes were fixed on me, unblinking. She was wearing the outfit from my favorite commission—, he black crop top and torn jeans.

My brain couldn't process it.

I thought maybe I was higher than I realized, I'd smoked some weed earlier to take the edge off, but not enough for this. I thought maybe I'd fallen asleep at my desk. I thought maybe I was having a stroke.

But she didn't disappear. She just stood there, watching me.

I took off my headphones slowly. The movement seemed to interest her. Her head tilted slightly, fox-like and curious.

""You're not real,"" I whispered.

She smiled. It wasn't a human smile, her muzzle couldn't quite form that expression right. But I knew it was a smile.

Then she moved closer.

Each step was fluid and wrong. Not the way a person walks. Not even the way an animal moves. Something in between, something my brain kept rejecting as impossible.

But she kept coming closer.

I should have run. I should have screamed. I should have done literally anything except what I did.

I reached out toward her.

I wanted to touch her. I wanted to prove she was real. I wanted—God, I don't even know what I wanted. My body was moving before my brain could catch up, flooded with a mix of terror and arousal that made me feel sick and electrified at the same time.

She closed the distance between us in one smooth motion.

Up close, she smelled like something I couldn't identify. Not perfume, animal musk. Something that made my head swim.

Her hand—paw?—touched my chest gently. The fur was impossibly soft. She was real. She was *real*.

I heard myself make a sound, something between a gasp and a moan.

She leaned in close, her muzzle near my neck. I felt her breath, hot and steady.

And then her mouth opened.

It stretched wider than it should have been able to. Too wide. The ambient light caught rows of teeth that were too sharp, too many.

She bit into my shoulder.

The pain was instant and overwhelming, but it wasn't just pain. It was pleasure too—intense, flooding, wrong pleasure that made every nerve in my body light up like I'd grabbed a live wire. I felt her teeth sink deep, not into skin, but deep enough to make me feel warm, felt something *enter* me through the wound, felt it worm its way into my brain like a parasite finding a host.

I couldn't scream. Couldn't move. Could only watch her come onto my laps.

I nutted, like fucking nutted from that, and she finally pulled back. She pulled down my pants, and she licked it off slowly, maintaining eye contact the whole time.

Then, she smiled again.

And vanished back into the darkness.

Not slowly. Not fadeout. Just—gone. One moment she was there, the next the corner of my room was empty.

I collapsed onto my bed, my shoulder aching, my whole body shaking. I lost my virginity to a fucking fox.

The bite mark was real. I could feel it, hot and wet.

I passed out somewhere around 3 AM.





I woke up at noon the next day with my mom pounding on my door.

""You alive in there?""

""Yeah,"" I croaked. My throat was dry. My shoulder was on fire.

""There's coffee downstairs. And you need to do laundry, your hamper is overflowing.""

I heard her footsteps retreat down the hallway.

I sat up slowly, the memory a fever dream my body refused to forget. My fingers found the evidence on my skin: two crescents of punctures, deep and an angry red. It was real. She had been real. As I touched the wound, a jolt spiked through me. Not of pain, but of that same terrifying, electric pleasure. It stole my breath.

I couldn't stop touching the mark. I couldn't stop my mind from circling back to her, the phantom sensation of her weight on my lap, the unblinking intensity of her gaze.

The next few days were a blur.

I didn't leave my room except to use the bathroom. I couldn't eat; my stomach would twist into knots at the thought of food. I couldn't sleep every time I closed my eyes, I saw her. Felt her teeth on my shoulder. Smelled that animal musk.

I searched my room obsessively, looking for any sign she'd been there. Any proof. But there was nothing except the bite mark, which was healing impossibly fast.

By day three, I realized what was happening to me.

I needed to see her again.

Not wanted. *Needed.* The way you need air or water. It was physical, a crawling sensation under my skin, an itch I couldn't scratch. My hands shook. I couldn't focus on anything else. Every thought circled back to Red.

Where had she gone? Would she come back? How could I make her come back?

I tried to dull it with weed. Smoked until my room was thick with it, until my mom yelled through the door about ""hotboxing the whole goddamn house."" It helped a little. Took the edge off enough that I could think semi-clearly.

I raided my mom's medicine cabinet. Found some old painkillers from her dental surgery last year. Those helped too, made everything soft and distant for a few hours.

But the Itch always came back. That's what I started calling it in my head, the Itch. Capital I. Because it was more than an itch, it was a *need*, a craving that made every other desire I'd ever felt seem quaint in comparison.

I needed to understand what had happened to me.





I started going through my computer's files obsessively.

I thought if I could find the first image of Red I'd ever saved, I could trace it back. Find the original artist. Maybe contact them. Maybe understand where she'd come from.

It was day five since the bite, and my fingers were jittery as I dug through old folders. I'd saved thousands of images over the past year. Maybe tens of thousands. My organization system was chaotic at best.

I headed to the garage,  I started digging through the pile of old desktops and laptops I'd stored away.

I was three folders deep into an unlabeled directory on one of the older desktops, when I found something I didn't recognize.

A folder titled ""PRIVATE - DO NOT OPEN.""

It wasn't mine. The file dates were all wrong, the oldest went back at least a decade years. I'd only been into furry art for about a year and a half.

I opened it.

Inside were dozens of image files. Digital sketches. All furry art.

All drawn by the same hand.

My mother's hand. I recognized her style immediately, she used to do illustrations for children's books back when I was a kid, before the divorce, before she got the office job she hates.

But these weren't children's book illustrations.

They were furry characters. Dozens of them. Wolves, rabbits, dragons, all in various states of dress and undress. Some were innocent enough, character studies, expression sheets. Others were more explicit.

And one character appeared over and over again.

A pig furry. Massive, hulking, grotesque. Not stylized or cute like some furry art tries to be. This thing looked *wrong*. Too-human eyes in a too-animal face. Thick, muscular body crammed into clothes that didn't quite fit. Hooves that looked more like gnarled hands.

My mom had labeled the file ""Piggy.psd.""

I clicked through the sketches, my stomach twisting.

The early drawings were rough, experimental. But they got more detailed as I went chronologically. More specific. More *real*.

And there were notes written in the margins. Text layers she'd left visible.

""He came to me in a dream last night.""

""Can't stop thinking about his eyes.""

""Drew him again. Had to. The itch is worse when I don't.""

""He feels so real now. Almost solid.""

""My hands hurt but I have to keep drawing. He wants me to draw him.""

The last file was dated three days ago. The drawing showed Piggy in perfect, photorealistic detail. Every bristle of fur. Every wrinkle in his snout. Every stain on his shirt.

At the bottom, in small text: ""Tonight. He's coming tonight.""

I sat back from the computer, my heart hammering.

My mom.

My *mom* was a gooner too.





""THOSE ARE PRIVATE!""

I'd been so absorbed in the files that I hadn't heard my mom come into garage. She was standing in my doorway, face pale, eyes wide with panic.

I spun around in my chair. ""What the fuck are these?""

""Give me the computer. Now.""

""You draw furries?"" I was still trying to process it. ""You've been drawing them for *years?*""

""You don't understand—"" She moved toward me, hands out like she was approaching a wild animal.

""I saw one!"" The words burst out of me. ""Red. She was in my room. She was *real*.""

My mom froze.

Her eyes went to my shoulder. I was wearing a tank top—the bite mark was visible, the scars already silvery and old-looking despite being less than a week old.

""No,"" she whispered. ""No no no, you didn't—""

""She bit me. Right here. She was real and she bit me and now I can't stop thinking about her and I—""

""YOU LET ONE MARK YOU?"" Her voice cracked into a scream.

I stood up, knocking my chair back. ""Let her? I didn't LET her do anything! She just appeared and—""

""Do you know what you've DONE?"" She was crying now, tears streaming down her face. ""Do you have ANY idea what that means?""

""Then explain it to me!"" I shouted. ""Explain what the fuck is happening!""

She grabbed my shoulders and tried to pull me away from the computer. I shoved her back.

""Just tell me!"" I yelled. As she lunged past me to unplug the desktop, I grabbed her shoulder and spun her around. ""What the fuck is Piggy?""

All the color drained from her face. Then, the slap, it came out of nowhere, a stinging crack that snapped my head to the side.

""Get out,"" she said quietly.

""Mom—""

""GET OUT! Get out of my house! You don't understand anything! You're just like your fucking father!""

She was sobbing now, backing away from me like I'd threatened her.

I grabbed my jacket and my phone and left.





Dave's house was twenty minutes away by bus.

He answered the door in sweatpants and a t-shirt with cartoon dinosaurs on it—his daughter's favorite show. ""Holy shit, man. You look like hell.""

""Can I crash here tonight?""

""Yeah, of course. You okay?""

""Not really.""

His wife Amy was putting their kids to bed. The house smelled like dinner; real food, home cooked, not the microwave meals and takeout that comprised my entire diet. There were toys scattered across the living room floor. Pictures on the walls. A life that felt impossibly distant from mine.

Dave set me up on their couch with blankets and a pillow. ""You want to talk about it?""

""Not really,"" I said again.

He nodded. ""I'm here if you change your mind. Bathroom's down the hall if you need it.""

After he went upstairs, I lay on the couch in the dark, listening to the sounds of a normal household settling in for the night. Footsteps above me. Muffled voices. A kid laughing at something. The hum of the refrigerator.

Dave had his shit together. He'd always been the responsible one, even in high school. Job at an insurance company, married at 23, kids by 25. He'd invited me to his wedding and I'd made excuses about being busy. The truth was I couldn't stand to see how far ahead of me he'd gotten.

Lying there in his living room, surrounded by evidence of his actual adult life, I felt like a child.

No. Worse than a child. At least children have potential. I was just... stuck. Frozen. Twenty-four years old and nothing to show for it except a hard drive full of furry porn and a bite mark from something that shouldn't exist.

The Itch was getting worse. Even with the weed and pills dulling it, I could feel it crawling under my skin. The need to see her again. Touch her again. Feel her teeth in my shoulder.

Around 2 AM, I gave up trying to sleep.

I had to go home.







The house was dark when I got back.

All the lights were off, which was weird, my mom usually left the porch light on at least. I used my key to let myself in quietly.

The living room was empty. Kitchen dark. Everything silent.

My mom's bedroom door was open.

It was *never* open. She was weirdly private about her room, always kept the door closed and locked. Even when I was a kid, her bedroom was off-limits.

But now it was open, and there was light coming from inside.

I approached slowly, my heart hammering.

I could hear sounds. Wet sounds. Breathing. Something that might have been words but came out strangled and wrong.

I reached the doorway and looked inside.

My mom was on her knees on the floor.

Piggy was there.

Not a drawing. Not a fantasy. *There.* Real and solid and massive, exactly like the sketches but worse because he was three-dimensional, because he *smelled* like rotten meat and musk, because the sound of his breathing was phlegmy and thick.

My mom had her arms wrapped around him.

She was suckling at its chest tits, at a spot just below his jaw where the skin looked raw and wet. Her eyes were rolled back in her head, unfocused and glassy. She was making small sounds of pleasure, like an addict getting their fix.

Piggy's head was tilted back. His eyes were closed. He was grunting softly, one hoof-hand resting on my mom's head almost tenderly.

He was *feeding* on her. On her need, her addiction, her obsession.

And she was feeding on him right back.

Something in me snapped.

I don't remember running to the hallway closet. Don't remember grabbing the baseball bat we kept there for home defense. Don't remember crossing back to her bedroom.

I just remember swinging.

The bat connected with Piggy's shoulder with a wet, heavy thud.

He squealed, a horrific, pig-like sound corrupted by a human undertone, and dropped my mom. She slumped to the ground, her trance unbroken.

Slowly, Piggy turned to face me.

He took a step forward. His movement was slow, lumbering, deliberate.

I swung the bat again.

This time it cracked into his ribs. He staggered, grunted, but remained upright, reaching for me with those terrible hoof-hands. I scrambled backward, putting distance between us, and swung a third time. The blow landed across his snout.

A spray of blood erupted, dark and viscous. The smell hit me instantly: the tang of copper mixed with the foul stench of decay.

He squealed again, louder this time. Trying to reach past me, toward my mom, like she could protect him.

I didn't let him get close.

I lost count of how many times I hit him. The bat connected over and over, each impact sending jarring vibrations up my arms. His squeals grew weaker, his movements slower.

Finally, he collapsed.

I stood over him, bat raised, breathing hard. He looked up at me, his too-human eyes full of something that might have been fear or anger or just animal pain.

Then his body began to change.

The coarse fur seemed to lose its substance, dissolving into a wisping, black smoke. His solid form wavered, becoming translucent. He was unraveling into the air, thinning out like a forgotten breath.

Within seconds, he was gone. All that remained was a dark stain on my mom's carpet and a smell like ozone and burned hair.

I dropped the bat.

My mom was making sounds now. Coming out of the trance. She blinked, looked around, confused.

Then her eyes found the stain on the carpet.

""Where's Piggy?"" Her voice was small. Childlike. ""Where is he?""

I couldn't speak.

""WHERE IS HE?"" She was on her feet now, looking around frantically. ""What did you do? WHAT DID YOU DO?""

""I killed it,"" I managed. ""I killed that thing.""

The sound she made wasn't human. It was grief and terror and rage all mixed together.

""You don't understand. You don't understand what you've done.""

She grabbed my arm, nails digging in. ""We're bound to them. When we create them, part of us goes into them. Part of them stays in us.""

""What does that mean?""

""When they die—"" She couldn't finish. Doubled over with a coughing fit that sounded wrong, wet and painful.

When she straightened up, there was blood on her lips.

""Mom—""

Another coughing fit, more violent this time. She was bringing up blood, dark and thick.

""What happens?"" I grabbed her shoulders. ""Mom, what happens when they die?""

She looked at me, eyes wide with terror.

""I don't know. No one I've talked to online has ever... everyone says don't kill them. NEVER kill them.""

Her legs gave out. I caught her before she hit the floor.

""I can feel it,"" she whispered. ""Something's wrong. Inside me. Like something's missing. Like part of me is gone.""

She passed out in my arms.



I called 911, my voice shaking so badly the dispatcher had to ask me to repeat the address three times. Now, I’m just waiting in the stark, bright hallway of the ER, staring at the closed door they took her through. I have no idea what to tell them when they come out.

The Itch is still there, a constant, staticky buzz under my skin and deep in my brain. I’ve tried to find someone who would understand. I’ve scoured every dark corner of the internet, but my posts on paranormal forums are just digital screams into a void. ""Has anyone seen a woman made of shadows? A thing called Piggy?"" The only replies are from trolls.

My messages to the creator of the ""Red"" video go unread. Delivered. Never opened.

I don’t even know where to smoke.

I finally found a few obscure message boards where people aren’t just role-playing. They talk about Furries. People who’ve been Marked. They use the same words my mom did. ""Bound."" ""Marked."" 

And everyone, everyone says the same thing: Never kill them. The binding goes both ways. Creator and creation. Maker and monster.

What happens when one half of that bond dies? No one seems to know for sure.

I need to understand what’s happening. I need to find Red and make her explain. I need to know if there’s a way to fix this.

Any advice if I’m doing the right thing taking a step back and limiting contact? I had a crush on her so this whole dynamic was stressful,"Hey. I’m (24M). There’s this woman (23F) who is really inconsistent and I have no idea why. So like we’re in the same graduate program and we met before the program started at this open house. We were vibing for a while and talking while laughing because I found her cute and she was of a similar cultural background to mine, so we had a connection there.

I messaged her on instagram that day and we talked for a few days getting to know each other but the convo ended because she was in a different city and the program hadn’t started. But occasionally I would text her to check in or ask about the program.

Anyways, this person then started messaging me out of nowhere if I was in a particular place to say hi, etc or even responded to my stories. But also, they started to ignore my messages now. They used to open my messages and respond but now they leave them on delivered and they’re really inconsistent yet sometimes they send me random memes or stuff. One time they texted me at like midnight asking if someone from another social media account was me because it sounded like me, right out of the blue (it was me). But they also mentioned stuff like calling my friend cute to my face etc or even calling another friend cute over text. 

They also wanted to invite me for coffee one day and insisted because I helped them with something but they never actually went through with it (although I didn’t really look forward to it because I wasn’t expecting anything. I wanted to help her).

And yeah, they also laugh whenever I talk or try not to grin when I speak. And it gets kinda annoying because I think they simply just don’t respect me. Whenever I message to check in they barely even respond now (so I stopped), and yet out of the blue yesterday they messaged me asking a question for some project. But why would they ask me if they’re quite popular in the program — they are friends with the popular people in the program and definitely have friends. They also called me once at night like at 11 pm to ask something about how to hand in the project, out of the blue without us talking. 

You could argue that maybe they’re comfortable with me and see me as a good friend. Sure. But they’re inconsistent with text. They also choose not to like any of my posts on social media, which is weird if you’re “close with someone”. She also sent me stuff that her dad does for a living and shared about her culture with me and wanted to share it with me? They like everyone else’s post, even guys who are married and are my friends and they’ve never even talked to them. 

So because they reached out of the blue despite ignoring me constantly and only either send dumb memes or in this case asked for help (which I’ve helped them before and have got nothing in return — even on a quiz where I helped them, they didn’t respond to me on time when I needed it, although they did apologize). When I didn’t want to help once last year, she started saying “okay looks like I’m gonna fail” etc so I helped her. but she has friends in the class. Which I feel bad for but I find that inconsiderate and rude behaviour and I’m ignoring her. She has her own friends who she can ask. When it was my birthday, she texted me individually and when I kept it short (because I know she’s a bad texter with me. She kept engaging in the convo and I messed up because she ended up being inconsistent again)…

She told me she’s controlling in a way when it comes to dating… while I was sitting next to her friend in class, she decided to move for the first time ever and seek her friend and I heard their convo. She said that “she never texts guys first”. I also heard her be skeptical on a guy who texted her “too fast” — “like he just texted me. Isn’t that kinda too fast?” ",1,1762365219.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Finding a great place to rent in Cairo can feel like navigating a bustling maze of neighborhoods, prices, and contracts. With a little strategy, you can skip the stress and land a home that fits your lifestyle and budget. Here are seven essential tips for [rent  house in Cairo](https://housepointegypt.com/rent/apartments/cairo) that will help you find the perfect place faster.

1) Define your budget and true costs  
\- Start with a realistic monthly budget that accounts for rent, utilities, maintenance, internet, and security deposits.  
\- In Cairo, some landlords require a one-year advance or several months’ rent upfront. Clarify the payment schedule before you fall in love with a place.  
\- Don’t forget utility realities: electricity in Cairo can be a large variable, so ask about average monthly bills and whether air conditioning is included in the rent.

2) Prioritize neighborhood essentials  
\- Decide what matters most: distance to work or school, safety, schools, access to public transport, coffee shops, or green spaces.  
\- Popular areas for different needs:  
  \- Maadi and Zamalek: leafy, expatriate-friendly, quieter streets.  
  \- New Cairo: modern buildings, larger apartments, newer amenities.  
  \- Downtown Cairo: vibrant life, shorter commutes for some jobs, older buildings with character.  
  \- Nasr City or Heliopolis: more affordable options with good connectivity.  
\- Visit at different times of day to gauge noise and traffic patterns.

3) Inspect like a pro (and don’t skip the small details)  
\- Schedule a walk-through with a checklist: structural integrity, water pressure, plumbing, electrical outlets, working lights, and functioning AC units.  
\- Check for signs of damp, mold, leaks, and pests. In Cairo, humidity and seasonal rains can reveal weak sealing or poor drainage.  
\- Test security: verify sturdy doors, secure locks, and window protections if you’ll be on higher floors.  
\- Take photos before moving in and ask for a written list of existing damages to avoid disputes later.

4) Understand the lease thoroughly  
\- Read the contract carefully: length of the lease, renewal terms, deposit conditions, maintenance responsibilities, and who handles repairs.  
\- Clarify who pays for utilities, internet, and common area maintenance.  
\- Look for clauses about early termination and any penalties. In Cairo, lease terms can vary significantly by landlord.  
\- Ensure a clear move-in and move-out checklist to prevent disputes over deposits.

5) Scout with a mix of online and on-the-ground tools  
\- Use trusted local listing sites, social media groups, and real estate agents who understand Cairo’s rental market.  
\- Combine online photos with an in-person visit to confirm the listing’s accuracy—photos can be deceptive.  
\- Don’t rush. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be mindful of rental scams and never wire money before signing a contract and visiting the property.

6) Negotiate like a savvy renter  
\- Even in a fast-moving market, tenants can negotiate: rent price, included amenities, or the length of the lease.  
\- If you’re flexible on move-in dates or willing to commit to a longer term, landlords may offer a discount or favorable terms.  
\- Bring competitive offers from comparable properties to strengthen your position, but stay respectful and reasonable.

7) Plan for the practicalities of living in Cairo  
\- Utilities and services: confirm electricity, water, internet installation timelines, and any required meters.  
\- Maintenance and emergencies: find out how to contact the landlord or management for urgent repairs and typical response times.  
\- Building rules and community norms: some buildings have strict visitor policies, noise rules, or parking regulations. If you own a car, verify parking availability and security.  
\- Safety and emergency prep: map out the nearest clinics, pharmacies, and emergency services. For many renters, proximity to a good pharmacy and hospital can be as important as the rent itself.

Bonus tips: making the most of the Cairo rental scene  
\- Timing matters: the market can cool in certain seasons; you may find better deals if you’re flexible with your move-in window.  
\- Documentation ready: have your identity papers, proof of income, and references ready to speed up the application process.  
\- Build a simple checklist: track each property’s pros, cons, and how each aligns with your priorities to avoid decision fatigue.  
\- Plan for the long term: if you expect to stay for several years, a slightly higher upfront cost may be worth it for a better neighborhood or larger space.

Back then, we had a handful of restaurants and open land for miles.  
Now? We’ve got local flavor, great food, and things to do around every corner.

I just put together my **Katy Weekend Guide for 2025**, and I wanted to share a few highlights — or at least how I usually spend my weekends right here in town:

🍽️ **Friday Night Dinner** – The Harvest Restaurant on Mason Road is an awesome local favorite, and Fogo de Chão off Grand Parkway brings that full Brazilian steakhouse experience.

☕ **Saturday Morning** – Coffee from Kona Coffee or Serene Beans, then a walk through **Mary Jo Peckham Park** or time with the family at **Exploration Park**.

🍲 **Lunch** – Chocho Hot Pot at Katy Grand (DIY table cooking!) or Ambriza Social Kitchen at LaCenterra for Tex-Mex with personality.

🍻 **Afternoon** – Hanging out at **No Label Brewing Co.** — they’ve got live music, food trucks, and always a great community crowd.

🍝 **Dinner** – Da Vinci Ristorante Italiano near Cinco Ranch Blvd — cozy, romantic, and consistently one of Katy’s hidden gems.

🥞 **Sunday Brunch** – Black Walnut Café or First Watch. Perfect for slow mornings and good conversation.

💡 **Fun fact:** Katy’s restaurant boom really started when LaCenterra opened in the mid-2000s — now, between Katy Grand and new projects like Texas Heritage Marketplace, there’s more coming than ever before.

If you’ve got a *favorite Katy weekend spot*, I’d love to hear it — I’m collecting local recommendations for future posts and videos for our r/KatyTexasLifeAndLocal community.

I was recently diagnosed with FLD after trip to GP due to constant side pain, itchyness on a night and decrease in mood and energy. 

I absolutely hate bloodwork and was so anxious when I was told they would be taking multiple vials over a 2 month period.

My first test that was performed on 19/09 came back with a 115 iu/L and I was diagnosed with FLD, I have a large appetite and I'm obese according to my BMI of 38. 

I was a heavy ale / lager drinker and ate cured meats / scratchings / salted nuts all of the time; I also had a tendency of binge drinking on a weekend, whilst eating takeaway food throughout.

Since that first consultation, I was told to cut out UPFs, high sodium foods & alcohol altogether, and try to implement more exercise; just to see where I'd end up after a month. 

This was a very jarring appointment for me and it was definitely a wake up call, I would always tell myself that my lifestyle was fine and I would change if it began to affect my health.

Being a Nosocomephobic, the thought of consistent bloodwork really got to me; so after this I decided to do some research and came up with action plan that I hope sharing, will benefit someone in a similar position. 

I am by no means a medical expert, I just want to share my experience in hopes of motivating or assisting other younger guys who are going through something like me.

Vitamin Stack:

Morning - 
2 × Vitamin D3 (2000 IU)
1 × Acidophilus Probiotic

Lunch - 
2 × Vitabotics Liverel
2 × Vitabotics Ultra Omega-3

Dinner - 
1 × Vitamin E (400 IU)
2 × Silymarin - Milk Thistle (200 mg)

Bedtime - 
1 × NAC (600 mg)
2 × 4in1 Magnesium Compund - Glycinate, Citrate, Malate & Oxide (~400 mg of elemental magnesium)

Workout:

A minimum of 12,000 steps a day, whether that's light cardio by jogging in a local park or around the block, or going to a gym to use a treadmill or purchasing a stepmachine.

Diet:

Full abstinence of alcohol, using the 'I am sober' app has halped me with this.

Lunches & Dinners mainly consisting of protein (primarily chicken, have avoided red meats like Lamb & Beef due to its fat content) and plenty of fruit/salad/veg, minimal carbs (but wholegrain if having carbs - this could be in the form of brown rice, brown pasta, brown bread, etc.).

For snacks I subbed out cured meats for fridge raiders (only as a treat, due to its preservatives and sodium) and would snack on pickled eggs (I know, gross for some people!) or pickled gerkhins.

I would also treat myself to exactly 2 unsalted Brazil nuts on a night with a cup of black tea, as they have a good amount of Selenium in them.

For drinks, a lot of black coffee (which is apparently good for your liver?) and the occasional diet soda, my go to is Pepsi Max.

I recently had my second blood test on 30/10, which came back with a 76 iu/L. They're saying they're going to check this again in the near future, but I think decrease of 39 iu/L is hopefully a step in the right direction.

Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this, hopefully I could learn a thing or two from you lovely folks to improve my health.",1,1762365039.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,1.0,False

1op9pgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1op9pgw/from_personal_script_to_a_saas_product/,From personal script to a SaaS product,"A month ago I launched DoCV ([docv.io](http://docv.io)). Funny thing is, it wasn’t meant to be a public app at all.

I’d been laid off and was struggling to get traction. While applying, I hacked together a tiny tool to speed up tailoring my CV to each job description. Nothing fancy, just enough to save me time. Then I started researching and kept seeing the same pain everywhere: tailoring is slow, repetitive, and confusing. That’s when I thought, ""Why not put this online and see if it helps others (and maybe cover some coffee money)?"" One feature led to another, UI, backend, prompts, guardrails, and suddenly I had a real product.

That’s where the non-technical challenge hit me. After launch it felt like my app and I were on one side, and the entire internet was on the other. I watched hundreds of YouTube videos, read articles and founder stories, and tried to assemble a marketing plan. I tested everything I could: tweets, short videos, onboarding tweaks… Traffic came, but engagement stayed meh.

Then I made one small change: I added a free ATS score check right on the landing page, no signup required. And suddenly… people started using it. That tiny ""try before signup"" shift unlocked the door. Folks could feel the value first, without hoops.

What I learned (so far):

* Let people try your product, not just read about it.
* Don’t force signup until they’ve seen value.
* Small changes can have big impact.

Month 1 snapshot (all organic, £0 ads):

* \~150 users so far
* 8 paid

Day to day, I’m answering feedback, fixing bugs, testing onboarding ideas, and figuring out budgets. I’m learning something new every single day.

If you’re building too, I hope this helps: sometimes the simplest change moves the needle the most.

And because I’d love to keep improving:

* Do these early numbers feel promising enough to keep pushing?
* How are you bringing in engaged users (not just traffic)? Any channels or tactics that actually stuck?",1,1762364805.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1op9ntu,https://i.redd.it/zbepdhl37hzf1.jpeg,"Tried “The Boho Storyy” perfumes at Mall of India, Noida. Anyone here used them?","So I was out shopping at Mall of India, Noida, and came across this small open kiosk called The Boho Storyy. The area around it was already smelling really pleasant, so my fiancée (who knows I can’t resist fragrances) nudged me to check it out.

The person at the counter was genuinely nice and seemed really passionate about what he was doing, not at all pushy like most salespeople. I tried four perfumes, and two really stood out to me:

Noir Nebula – coffee, vanilla, slightly sweet and floral

Scottish Breeze – fresh, mild citrusy type.

Both were actually quite impressive for a first try. The only thing that stopped me from buying was the price . It was around ₹5k–₹5.5k for 100ml. They also had these discovery sets (10ml x 2 combos) but unfortunately not with the two I liked together.

Has anyone here tried The Boho Storyy before?

 Curious if their perfumes justify the price. I get that a lot of Indian houses take inspiration from designer or niche versions (which is fine if done well), but I’d happily pay for something truly unique and well-crafted.

Would love to hear thoughts from anyone who’s tried them or knows more about their blends and longevity.

**Forgot to take images. So, posting from their website, in case, anyone recognises from the bottle/ packaging.

***Also the prices mentioned are an estimate as I don't exactly remember what the sales person quoted. But, it was somewhere around the mentioned prices.

- coffee first thing in the morning 
- making a breakfast but eating one or two bites 
- not eating or snacking on little things until around mid-day

how can i fix my diet? i know this is not a feasible routine and will affect me later down the line. i try to eat healthier by incorporating veggies or fruits, but even then, i never stick to it.

i drink water often, but still never hit my water goals. i vape, so i suspect that is also affecting my lack of hunger, so ive been trying to curb it by not bringing my vape around when im not home.",1,1762364682.0,healthyeating,3,1.0,False

1op9c2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/x_Bloom/comments/1op9c2y/got_my_xbloom_yesterday_and_yay/,Got my xBloom yesterday and yay!!!,"I pondered for about 10 months, debating whether to buy the xBloom or another grind-n-brew.  Last winter, while staying at a Tempo, I had a Nespresso Original lungo in the in-room coffee machine. I'm embarrassed to say that I went home and immediately bought one. This is from a person who loves to grind the beans right before brewing and is firmly against single-serve pod coffee.  However, I found the richness and nuance in the Nespresso to be better than any Aeropress or pour-over I had tried.

My current lifestyle just doesn't allow me the time to play around with grinding, pressing, etc. in the morning, and I am old and tired and just want a nice, rich warm cup quickly before I have to run off to work at an ungodly hour.  I've been drinking coffee since I was 12, and I enjoy it so much I switch to decaf after 3 cups in the morning, and have a post-dinner cup as well.

So, after reading reviews, I decided an xBloom might give me what I want.  Certainly, the freshly ground beans will provide a better cup than my Nespresso, right?

It was delivered last night and I was anxious to try it this morning. It came with 8 pods of Torque Cocoa Drops and the respective NFC card, which seemed easy so I tried it.

Yuck.  It was a light roast that was way too sweet for my taste and lacked that full-body flavor that I was getting with my (gasp) Nespresso.

Now, I stop to mention that I'm not a coffee snob, and admittedly not a ""taster"" when it comes to food, but I'm also not such a luddite that I prefer ""coffee shop"" blends.

So, I decided to go right to the Freesolo mode with the help of ChatGPT.  I had some Peace Coffee (light roast) and tried to mimic a v60.  Another bust -  way too acidic and had a metallic edge to it.  Maybe I needed to tweak the settings, but it was so far off from what I was looking for that down the drain it went.

Next, I grabbed some Starbucks Sumatra, medium dark-roast (single origin) that I picked up on sale at Safeway.  Not my favorite but it was on sale so the price was right and at the time I was in a fix.  I adjusted per ChatGPT for the roast, and off we go.

The result?  Amazing. Somehow, I hit the jackpot with the third brew.  Ok, ChatGPT was a great help with some guidance on xBloom settings, but a splash of 1/2 and 1/2 and I am in heaven!  I'm certain I'll have even better results as I explore some other dark roasts, but this is love and the recipe is a keeper.

Any recommendations for some solid dark roasts out there?  I'd appreciate it.",1,1762364017.0,x_Bloom,0,1.0,False

Price difference is $900 CAD vs $1760 CAD. My current machine is very entry level and full on manual so I don't mind the manual part of express impress. I do have a separate baratza encore grinder but seems like it's a hassle to use a third party grinder with impress tamper settings? The grinder kind of leads me to Touch impress.

I do have two toddlers to simplicity/less hands-on experience can be great. However, as much as I love my coffee, I'm not an espresso connoisseur so I'm trying to debate if the extra $900 is worth the investment (I don't mind paying if it is the right decision for me).

Every week, I email the class their materials...lecture slides, problem sets, and a “recommended video” for extra learning. It’s a small thing, but I like to think it helps students engage with the content.

This week’s topic was sampling bias. I meant to attach a YouTube video. Instead, I somehow pasted the wrong link.

And not just any wrong link.

The link was this: https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fkgwu0e8pqutc1.gif

I hit send. To all 200 students. At 8:17 AM.

Didn’t realize it until I checked my sent folder after my coffee kicked in.

Now, here’s the worst part: I always write a little note under the link, something encouraging like, “Watch this carefully and pay attention to how the visuals illustrate the concept.”

So yes. My entire class now has an email from their middle-aged statistics professor saying:

“Please watch this carefully and pay attention to the visuals.”

followed by a link to J.Lo

No one has said a word. Not a single student. No “wrong link, professor.” No “LOL.” Nothing. Just silence. Pure, deafening silence.

TL;DR: Meant to send my stats class a video on sampling bias. Sent J.Lo’s Booty instead. Told them to “pay attention to the visuals.” No one’s said anything. I may never recover.",47,1762363867.0,tifu,13,0.83,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!).

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Before deciding to take the Gap, I had some “f\*\*\* you money” money, enough to support around five years of personal life. I thought the Gap was necessary because at the time, the industry I was in wasn’t going to be my career for life, so I spent my youth searching for a second income source.

1. Try different industries, drop old thoughts, and let new ideas develop.
2. Don't be so focused on money-making projects, but more on choosing projects based on interest. This is my understanding of the Gap: not fight for traditional success or development, but to give myself a period to look at the world and understand the world.

The following are the side jobs I did during my 2-year gap:

1. Barista: I usually look for coffee shops I like in my city, and if there’s an open spot, I’ll take a part-time job there. I prefer cafes with unique interiors and interesting customers, it makes work feel less tiring. But to be honest, this job can be physically demanding, and the pay isn’t great.
2. Account Executive in Advertising: The reason I got into this is that my previous job was related to the ad industry, so I already had some clients who started reaching out to me for freelance projects. It feels a lot freer than working for a company, but it also requires more self-discipline and planning. I mainly handle client communication, content planning, and project follow-ups. It’s not physically exhausting, but it’s still pretty draining, classic agency life haha.
3. Stocks & Funds: My investment strategy is pretty simple. I use half of my capital for short-term trades in stocks I’m familiar with, usually making about 1–8% every two months. The other half goes into areas I’m less familiar with, but I try to analyze candlestick charts and follow the news daily to predict trends. Since I’m still learning, the results are pretty average, probably below what a rational investor would typically earn.
4. Youtuber: I generate story outlines using ChatGPT and make videos with MagicLight. The workflow is pretty simple, which allows for regular updates, and it’s a high cost-performance side job. There were times I was anxious about data, but then I realized I couldn’t control the flow. Learning some tricks and posting on different platforms helped me create more engaging content. The results were decent, and I’m also exploring new ways to monetize this account.
5. DJ: I have some friends who make music, and we often hang out at clubs together. I’ve always been interested in making music too, but I never had time to learn when I was working full-time. So during my gap period, I studied some DJ basics and started working part-time at a small club I really like. I love the job, though I often worry I’m not good enough yet — but surprisingly, it actually pays pretty well.",5,1762363432.0,thesidehustle,1,1.0,False

He’s here every morning with his laptop, taking Zoom calls, using our Wi-Fi, drinking our coffee, and leaving dishes everywhere.

When I asked my roommate if he could work at his own place, she said, “His Wi-Fi is bad, and you’re not even home during the day.”

So I changed the password.

She freaked out, saying I was “controlling” and “making things uncomfortable.” I said, “You’re welcome to share rent with him if he’s going to use half the utilities.”

Now she says I “ruined the dynamic.”

Here is the selection from the snippet section [of the newsletter](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/). I selected around 30% of the content. Its all human made:

# Week of 6th of October (#168)

**Berlin & Germany, career & timeless**

1. We celebrated the reunification last Friday. One thing that didn't reunify are the salaries: the wage gap between East and West Germany [stands at](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/lohne-in-west-und-ost-die-lucke-wird-etwas-kleiner--doch-bei-hoheren-einkommen-gibt-es-noch-grosse-unterschiede-14421131.html) 17.4%. Full-time workers earn €4,810 monthly in the West versus €3,973 in the East. Higher earners still face a 19.3% gap that has barely changed since 2014. Low-wage earners have nearly caught up thanks to the minimum wage.
2. *I am not surprised at all. Are you?* Berlin's rent price review office [found](https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2025/10/berlin-mietwucher-wohnen-mietpreispruefstelle.html) excessive rents in 93% of cases examined over six months, with 63% (120/190 cases) exceeding comparable rents by more than 50%, potentially being criminal ""exorbitant rents.""
3. NGP Capital released its [DACH Decoded 2025](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63887690330617511e6e0344/68dab8d7d00a8dd76fc206f9_542ce375786eb9fe75a9951967fb9206_DACH%20Startups%20Decoded_2025_FIN.pdf) report. In the past 12 months (Q3 24–Q2 25), Berlin-based companies raised $2.80B, falling behind Munich's $3.44B. This marks a reversal from the previous year, when both cities were neck-and-neck at $2.0B each, and a deviation from the usual Berlin coming out on top. Both cities are far ahead of the 3rd Zürich ($0.81B).
4. *Timeless:* [An excellent point of view on ageing](https://scottsumner.substack.com/p/subjective-time). Time flies because we are caught in our routines and are less and less surprised by the world around us. “As you get older, you barely pay attention to things that you would have been entranced by when young.”

**Briefly**

1. Stats: Every year, **75 kilograms** of food per person [are thrown away](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/10/lebensmittel-muell-verschwendung-berlin-brandenburg.html) in Germany.
2. Compare renewables [energy generation](https://electrek.co/2025/09/30/solar-leads-eu-electricity-generation-as-renewables-hit-54-percent/) (54% in Q2 25) [to the energy consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-consumption-by-source-and-country?country=~OWID_EU27) (still mostly oil, coal and gas). We need storage.
3. Digitalisation going well! Starting in October, doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies are required to use the electronic patient record system, which should make it easier to transfer data between different institutions. [FAQ is available in the article.](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/09/elektronische-patientenakte-epa-pflicht-faq.html)

**Weekly social is turning into a collection of Reddit links.**

1. Reddit: [Cheat codes in life that actually work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nac1b4/whats_a_cheat_code_you_discovered_in_real_life/) Compliments rule.

# Week of 13th of October (#169)

**Berlin & Germany, career & timeless**

1. I did my third Berlin startup breakdown, [this time with **Almedia**, an adtech company](https://handpickedberlin.com/almedia-berlin-startup-breakdown/). I was impressed by their bootstrapped story.
2. Remember all the stupid memes about innovation in EU, showing the attached bottle caps? There is a lot of room for improvement, sure, but how about instant bank transfers that are mandatory since 9th of October. The control against typos and fraud is name matching. I tested it and it works really well. Not sure what this means for the extremely popular PayPal.
3. Despite all the protests and jokes, A100 extension [has support](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stadtautobahn-a100-mehrheit-der-berliner-spricht-sich-fur-weiterbau-aus-14479124.html) in town: About 57% of respondents support extending the highway to Lichtenberg, while nearly 32% opposed it (n=2500).
4. Misuse of residential housing is illegal in Germany. Violations include short-term vacation rentals without permits, apartments left empty for months or residential space converted to offices or commercial use. [You can anonymously report violators](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/352954/).
5. Speaking of residential housing, for the first time in the history of Berlin [a landlord needs to pay a fine for extreme rent overcharging](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/friedrichshain-kreuzberg/berliner-wohnung-190-prozent-zu-teuer-hohes-bussgeld-wegen-horrender-mietforderung-setzt-signal-14525981.html). The 38m² Friedrichshain apartment's rent exceeded local standards by 190% when only 20% is allowed. In addition to the €26k fine, €22k in excess rent must be refunded to the former tenant. More proceedings are currently running.
6. I have a restaurant to recommend: [Merold](https://restaurant-merold.de/) in Neukölln. Excellent place for new German cuisine for special occasions or for a regular night out if you don’t mind spending 100+ per person. Interesting interior that somehow reminded me of a spacious place somewhere much warmer.
7. *Career:* [A case for hiring junior engineers](https://workweave.dev/blog/hiring-only-senior-engineers-is-killing-companies). You can replace “engineers” with anything else. This reminds me of a beautiful book Zen mind, Beginner's mind by Shunryū Suzuki, with the main premise that in a beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s, there are few. I wrote about [the book three years ago](https://eightyfour.substack.com/p/zen-mind-beginners-mind-summary).

**Briefly**

1. Stats: 42% of startup employees in Berlin [are](https://startupverband.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/deutscher-startup-monitor-2025-startup-standort-mit-positivem-momentum-%E2%80%93-ki-und-deeptech-treiben,-kapital-bleibt-engpass-29-09-2025/) immigrants.

**Weekly Reddit**

1. Reddit: [Small moments of happiness for Berliners.](https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1nu88k2/what_are_your_small_moments_of_happiness_in_berlin/) For me seeing a familiar stranger in my go-to café.

# Week of 20th of October (#170)

**Berlin & Germany, career & timeless**

1. Don’t throw your broken toaster away yet! [RaparaturBONUS](https://www.ibb-business-team.de/reparaturbonus/) (repairing of broken electrical devices with a 50% subsidy) is coming back in 2026 and 2027
2. How much are fines worth if they are not enforced? Not much, but it might be a good business case for the always-broke city of Berlin. After the first fine was issued last week, the housing crisis has been all over the media. Hundreds of tenants [are reporting](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/berlins-erstes-mieten-bussgeld-und-die-folgen-hunderte-anzeigen-gegen-vermieter--doch-die-bezirke-sind-gelahmt-14574884.html) excessive rents (for example, Mitte 440, Pankow 200), but districts lack personnel to process them. Pankow will only get 2 new positions in 2027. Mitte will expand the current 0.5FTE to 2 over the next two years. It’s probably also a bit of a political topic, no? If the government really cared, they could do more.
3. I looked for German companies in the top 50 companies from [Sifted’s 250](https://sifted.eu/intelligence/reports/sifted-250-2025) fastest-growing startups in 2025. With career links: [FINN](https://www.finn.com/de-DE/careers) (Munich) is #1 with 1078.32%, [tl;dv](https://tldv.notion.site/Come-work-at-tl-dv-8da9921dfaaa40d68450790a09d81efe) (Cologne) is #3 with 736.66%, [finmid](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/finmid.com) (Berlin) is #8 with 582.90%, [Nelly](https://www.getnelly.de/en/jobs) (Berlin) is #11 with 559.03%, [Sewts](https://www.sewts.com/more/career) (Munich) is #20 with 461.38%, and [Frontnow](https://www.frontnow.com/careers) (Berlin) is #36 with 336.62%. The data is self-reported, and not all startups submit it.
4. If you are one of the people who want to escape Berlin's darkness, [here is a map](https://www.airport-region.de/standortvorteile/moderne-infrastruktur/index.php?id=12&mapType=1&map=13&mode=&L=0) of all the destinations you can fly to from BER. Newly added for winter season: Abu Dhabi from November 3x weekly, Kittilä in Finland from January 31 1x weekly, Marsa Alam in Egypt from November 9 1x, London Southend from November 1x, and Seville from October 27 2x. Ryanair cut its capacity from BER: Tel Aviv, Riga, Kaunas, Brussels and Krakow fell off.
5. If you stay in Berlin, a good cocktail bar would be a good idea! Berlin was again well represented at Mixology Bar awards: [Green Door](https://www.greendoor.de/de/) won ""Bar of the year – Germany"" for the second consecutive year and also took home ""Bar team of the year."" [Buck & Breck](https://www.buckandbreck.com/) received the award for ""Bar institution"" while their bartender Vito Nicotra was named ""Bartender of the year."" Arash Ghassemi from [Bar Basta](https://www.instagram.com/basta.berlin/?hl=en) earned the title ""Host of the year.""
6. *Career:* Something to keep in mind when you plan your career is to “rise up, jump across”, meaning that you should not change your job to get promoted, because it’s unlikely to work well, especially in startup environments. [Dave Kellogg explains why](https://kellblog.com/2016/08/25/on-hiring-promote-stars-not-strangers/).
7. *Timeless:* [21 facts about throwing good parties](https://www.atvbt.com/21-facts-about-throwing-good-parties/) includes several good tips on how to make a great party. I can also warmly recommend [two-hour cocktail parties](https://party.pro/book/), I threw a couple, and the concept really works well.

**Briefly**

1. **TAZ** (die Tageszeitung), a left-leaning cooperative newspaper, stopped publishing weekday print editions.
2. **Perplexity** opened an office in Berlin. [Careers.](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/careers#open-roles) (2 jobs only). Related, look at [the drop in traffic to Lovable](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-pisarski_is-lovable-dying-web-traffic-has-declined-activity-7381424054764806144-Vo6h/).
3. **Revolut** has [acquired](https://sifted.eu/articles/revolut-acquires-ai-travel-agent-startup-swifty?utm_campaign=Sifted%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=385094029&utm_content=385094029&utm_source=hs_email) **Swifty** (Berlin, travel), as the company builds out its AI assistant offering. It also has almost [3x more app downloads](https://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/revolut-haengt-n26-ab-in-deutschland-ab-onlinebanken-im-vergleich-a-b60dd6cd-16fb-42ff-ac4a-5583b7c16206) than **N26** this year. N26 also reportedly [has](https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/banken/banken-machtkampf-um-aufsichtsratsposten-bei-n26/100163382.html) internal power struggles about the supervisory board seats.

# Week of 27th of October (#171)

**Berlin & Germany, career & timeless**

1. I'm excited to test a new format: Money Talks, where I openly discuss money with Berliners. Income is taboo in Germany, but hearing how others manage and think about money offers a valuable insight. [Happy to introduce you to Anna, 32F from Mitte.](https://handpickedberlin.com/money-talk-anna-32f-mitte/)
2. I listened to your feedback and did another overview of under-the-radar companies in Berlin. [This time I chose four: Carl Zeiss Meditec (pitched by a reader), GE Vernova, Bundesdruckerei and Camunda.](https://handpickedberlin.com/4-interesting-companies-berlin-you-should-know/) If you know of any other hidden champions in town, send them over.
3. On Friday morning, several **LAP Coffee** stores were vandalised. I made a mistake of reading a few comments on Reddit on the matter. It’s amazing to see how confidently people make assumptions and how many can’t see 2 cm beyond their “it’s VC money to push out the competition” argument. I guess THAT TikTok started it, and you could shovel through bad takes for weeks.
4. Chancellor Merz caused [an uproar,](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-merz-under-fire-for-racist-deportation-comment/a-74407407) along with protests in Berlin, with his “Stadtbild / cityscape” deportation comment a good week ago. He is probably trying to eat a bit of the AfD’s cake, which could actually work (as previously shown in [this newsletter.](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/archive/how-do-you-defeat-populists/) See also the poll below!). Expectedly, he received a backlash and needed to explain [himself later](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQH4HaDDV4-/). Some of the responses were great: [I loved this video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQFA_eUjRpX/) from Cossu, a comedian. This topic will stay with us, and while we are at it, in Berlin startups, 42% of the employees are immigrants! (*edit after the newsletter was sent out: The poll itself sparked debate - ZDF polled Merz's Wednesday clarification rather than his original statement, but critics felt the presentation blurred this distinction.* [*Full context*](https://www.zdfheute.de/in-eigener-sache/merz-stadtbild-politbarometer-in-eigener-sache-100.html)*.)*
5. \#ai\_berlin hub, managed by Berlin Partner, opened at CIC Berlin to attract AI startups and boost networking. The idea is to connect startups, companies, researchers, and the government. They received an initial funding of €725k in 2025, intending to make it self-sustaining.
6. Is **Nextbike** disappearing from our streets? They currently operate over 6k bikes without the required commercial permit after its publicly funded contract ended in July. They continued running the fleet independently without applying for a special-use permit. The court ruled that commercial bike-sharing at this scale requires authorisation, rejecting Nextbike's claim of general public use. The city ordered the removal of all bikes, but they’ll stay because of Nextbike’s court appeal.
7. Good news! Berlin [is getting](https://www.berlin.de/aktuelles/9970003-958090-mehr-baeume-fuer-berlin-geplant.html) hundreds of thousands of additional trees over 15 years, with final approval expected next month. The program will cost around €3B and aims to make Berlin greener and better prepared for heat, drought, and climate change.
8. Autumn is perfect for museums: [11 tips for free or discounted museums in Berlin!](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/blog/11-tips-free-and-affordable-museums-berlin)

Maybe it was about hunger. Or rain. Or love.

I want to say the right things  
to the right people  
at the right time.

I want home, but in small doses  
like a vine that creeps day by day towards your window,  
so that when you finally notice,  
it feels like it’s been there forever.  
I want the smell of turmeric on my fingers,  
old songs drifting in the kitchen,  
and sunbaked love.

I want good music, good food and good films.  
I want slow mornings and evenings that don’t rush me on Sundays.  
I want good company,  
the kind that lets me exist in peace without asking for performance.

barefoot and unhurried.

1op8vj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1op8vj5/visiting_coorg_chikmagalur_for_a_coffee_learning/,"visiting coorg & chikmagalur for a coffee learning trip ,looking to meet small estate farmers + roastery recs in bangalore (7–11 nov)","hey folks 👋🏽

i’m landing in bangalore just past midnight on 6 nov and heading out early 7 nov for a coorg → chikmagalur loop. flight back is 12 nov morning, so i’ve got 7–11 nov on the ground. i’m in the early stages of building a small, transparent bean business (initially micro-lots + limited drops), and this trip is purely to learn, cup, and meet people — not to hard-negotiate or lowball anyone.

my plan (flexible):

coorg (madikeri side): 7–8 nov
likely around madikeri / suntikoppa / kushalnagar / siddapura / virajpet belt. looking for small/medium estates (even <50 acres) open to a walk-through of picking/processing, a basic cupping, and honest talk on costs/logistics.

chikmagalur: 9–10 nov
leaning toward aldur / balehonnur / bababudangiri side. open to a quick stop in sakleshpur if it makes sense.

back to blr: 11 nov evening/night


what i’m specifically hoping to learn (and pay for cupping/tours if needed):

current harvest timelines + what’s realistically cuppable in november (i know it’s shoulder season; i’m ok doing educational cuppings from last crop if that’s what’s available).

processing profiles you’re excited about this year: washed, honey, naturals, anaerobic, CM, etc — and what’s practical at small scale without risking defects.

how you think about moisture/water activity, storage (bags, liners), and maintaining cup quality post-monsoon.

pricing models you prefer (ex-estate vs FOB), minimum order quantities, and what feels fair to you if a newcomer wants to trial 30–60 kg lots first.

honest view on defect tolerance, screening, and whether peaberry lots are worth chasing or just marketing fluff in my target markets.

realistic courier/transport routes out of coorg/chikmagalur to blr (and onward), and what breaks most first-timers.

any local mills/wet mills open to visitors for a short walk-through.


bangalore roastery crawl (11 nov) — who should i not miss?
i’d love to say hi, buy coffee, and learn from baristas/roasters about roast curves for india-origin beans (coorg/chikmagalur specifically), and get a sense of what’s resonating with home brewers right now. open to public cuppings or just hanging at the bar. recs welcome (DMs open).

about me (so you know where i’m coming from):

coffee nerding for ~6 months (pour-overs at home; very new to origin).

goal is to launch tiny, story-first drops with transparent sourcing and farmer credits; no race-to-the-bottom pricing.

happy to pay for time, samples, and cupping sessions — i value expertise.

i’m not asking anyone to do “free consulting”; if it’s helpful, i can also share basic content (photos/short reels) of the visit for your pages.


what i need from the community 🙏🏽

intros to small/medium estates around the zones above (owners/managers who are okay with a respectful, short visit).

names + contacts (DM is fine) of folks doing interesting micro-processes this season.

honest “don’t waste your time here in november; go there instead” advice.

bangalore roastery/café must-visits (for india-origin learning): who’s doing great filter/PO, dial-ins, public cuppings, or just super approachable teams.


how i’ll behave on visits:

i’ll be on time, keep visits short, follow whatever rules you set, and won’t post anything without permission. i’ll buy beans/merch where possible. if something is closed or not ideal this month, i’m happy just to learn and plan a proper sourcing trip pre-harvest next time.


thanks in advance. if you’re open to a quick call/DM to see if a visit makes sense, i’m super grateful. and if you’d rather point me to a co-op / aggregator / local cupper who can structure a single consolidated session in each region, that might be even better for everyone’s time.

     I am a M 33 from Kolkata. Matched over an app called Bloom. She shared me her WhatsApp number and I contacted her and later on she agreed for a date. 

      I came and waited for another 40 minutes or so. Later on, she came and took me to a chocolate shop. Asked me whether I could pay for that. Later on, I paid for her chocolate at ₹450. She took me to a bar/restaurant asked me what would I have. I told her to get a coffee for me worth ₹500 or so. Later on, she order a cigarette pack and an energy drink. All this amounts to ₹1200 or so. I saw her ordering a hookah. I didn't check the menu this time. She kept ordering. But actually the price of that hookah was ₹5500 each. I was ignorant of that. She called the waiter again and again and I saw that she was asking to replace the hookah. The hookah kept replacing as if it was getting fixed. But the waiters never confirmed from me that a new order of hookah was put forth twice.

Now suddenly one of the waiters came to me and asked ""Are you checking the menu before ordering?"". I replied, ""No. But I think she is"". I asked the management to bring the bill. The bill comes out more than ₹22000. 

I said I wasn't ordering. She was ordering on my behalf. They asked me to step outside to an underground room. They asked me I should pay for both of us. If there isn't enough money, I must ask the other person to pay the remaining amount. I said I can confirm I can pay a bill of about ₹1100 but I cannot pay for the hookahs which were ordered by the girl. I also texted and called my friend practising as a Supreme Court lawyer. He started calling. Finally, the supervisor agreed and they let me out of the bar. I paid 1100 bucks and left.

I purchased an Encore ESP Pro which I received a week ago and am having trouble getting my shots to not choke my machine or flow very slowly. Previously I was using a regular Encore to grind my coffee and didn't run into issues with low flow or choking.

No matter what, I've had to keep the grinder at it's starting espresso setting which is 40 (the manual recommends 20 as a starting point). I am using a Breville Bambino Plus as my machine. I am using a Normcore bottomless portafilter, WDT, level, and tamp with a normcore calibrated tamper (25lbs/11.3kg) puck screen, then extract. This was my workflow with the regular Encore as well. I have done the following with the ESP Pro.

Tried the default non pressurized double basket and IMS precision 18-22g basket at 18 grams with 1.7mm screen. Result: Choke or 1 or 2 drops.

Did the same as above with 1.0 mm puck screen. Same result as above.

used the default non pressurized double basket at a lower dose (16g). Tried with both the 1.7mm and 1.0mm puck screens. Either way both were too slow.

Used the IMS precision basket at 18g with 1.0mm screen. Too slow.

used varying beans from medium to dark with varying freshness from local roasters and the grocery store (roasted within a week, 2 weeks, a month and a half, and bags with no date which were probably roasted months ago). The older coffee still extracted very slowly.

From some videos I've seen on Youtube reviewing the grinder, all of them have been able to set the grinder much lower and get a good extraction going. The review by Lance Hendrick even showed him using a bean he considered dark at 20g and was able to set it to low 30s.

I have not tried a light roast with this grinder yet to see if it would require a lower setting and flow better. I tend to not use light roast in the Bambino plus as I've read/heard it is more suitable for medium to dark roasts. I did try with my original Encore and got a somewhat decent result.

I am left wondering, is my unit not calibrated properly and grinding too fine relative to what the setting is indicating?

Right now, I am feeling that it is a bit of a waste to have this grinder and not be able to properly use its espresso range as intended. I realize it's a new grinder so information will be limited, though any insight would be appreciated.

**Husband and Lindor** 

61 replies

Clementina49er · Today 16:15

A couple of weeks ago we were in Wilko together and he added a bx of Lindor in some weird flavour (possibly Baileys) to my shopping basket for which I paid without comment. They went on a shelf in the kitchen and I had maybe two out of the box before discovering the empty box a mere two days later. I made no comment but I must admit I thought ""that's a lot of chocolate to eat between meals in such a short time.""  
Ten days later I saw a box of Lindor dark chocolate mint flavour in Sainsburys so I bought them. I have a bit of a thing for dark chocolate and mint.... but a box of Bendicks lasts me at least a fortnight.  
The Lindor went in the cupboard but I'd have one from to time to time in the evening with a cup of coffee after my meal.... they weren't ""hidden "" as such because DH is perfectly capable of opening the cupboard door.... but I know what he's like with chocolate, sweets and biscuits and a packet left anywhere visible in the kitchen will be empty before you can say ""I was looking forward to eating one of those""... After lunch I noticed him go and help himself to one of the Lindor.... I made no comment, and decided I'd have one too..... I did notice there weren't many left in the box butagain, I didn't comment.... he's a grown man.  
However, when I saw with his hand in the box less than an hour later something snapped and I said ""only one a day"": he was very offended, but he knows where the supermarket is and has enough money to buy his own damn chocolate if he wants to make a pig of himself.... He is noticeably overweight and has a sweet tooth as well as a love of alcohol and fatty foods. I cook from scratch and we eat healthy, nutritious, filling meals so I really hate to see the crap he eats in between times, not because he's hungry, but because it's there.He buys bags of Doritos and creamy dips, adds mayonnaise to meals which have their own sauce and puts 3tsp of sugar in his coffee. I make no comment about any of this, but AIBU to set a rule that expensive chocolate which I have bought is limited to one a day? There is actually other chocolate in plain view on the table, so he could have helped himself to that, but he decided he wanted a second Lindor. I rather suspect that if I hadn't seen him with his hand in the box I would have gone to it this evening for a chocolate and found it empty.

*She's not treating him like a toddler, he's behaving like one.*

Thank you, that's exactly what I meant..... I don't try and stop him eating anything else in the house, and never comment on the crap he buys at the supermarket : as everyone has said, he's a grown man but very short on self control.  
To those wondering about the ""who buys it"" issue - whoever goes to the supermarket pays, if we go together I pay and I pay for everything in the basket. It is not a question of money, as we both have sufficient. And he has been known to go to the supermarket to buy stuff that he fancies four or five times a week!

To those sugesting I hide my treats that I want to eke out, I did that for a while but then he finds them and complains ""you've been hiding the chocolate again"".

*Tbf the box is already half empty when you open it !*

*I wouldn't police my husband on how many to have a day and surely if he's eating loads he's going to be feeling pretty sick quite soon !*

Feeling pretty sick has been known.... once (several years ago) I discovered an empty packet (400g of pure chocolate) that he had eaten over the course of an afternoon.  
When he complained he was feeling queasy I just laughed at him.

Incidentally, to various PP, I didn't ""snap"" at him, it's just the self control that stops me commenting on the crap he eats that snapped, but I made the comment in a jokey way.

I want to read the first poem ever written.  
I want to know what it was about. Who wrote it.  
Who it was for, who read it first.  
Was it carved into stone or whispered to someone half asleep?  
Maybe it was about hunger. Or rain. Or love.

***

**ii.**

I want to say the right things  
to the right people  
at the right time.  
And have silence mean what words cannot.

***

**iii.**

I want home, but in small doses  
like a vine that creeps day by day towards your window,  
so that when you finally notice,  
it feels like it’s been there forever.  
I want the smell of turmeric on my fingers,  
old songs drifting in the kitchen,  
and sunbaked love.

***

**iv.**

I want good music, good food and good films.  
I want slow mornings and evenings that don’t rush me on Sundays.  
I want good company,  
the kind that lets me exist in peace without asking for performance.

***

**v.**

I want to meet myself five years into the future  
not to ask what happened,  
but to see if she made it through the nights  
she thought she wouldn’t.  
If she still writes in margins,  
if she still lets her morning coffee sit too long,  
If she still gets bothered by her long hair brushing against her knees,  
I want to know if she’s learned to rest without guilt.

***

**vi.**

I want to stop one heart from breaking.  
Even if it’s mine.

***

**vii.**

I want to see my parents turn ninety,  
tend to them like my babies  
feed them their favourite sweets,  
cut mangoes the way they once did for me,  
massage their tired legs,  
comb my mother’s wavy hair,  
listen to my father hum SPB’s songs.  
I want to love them in the same patient ways  
they once loved me into being.

***

**viii.**

I want to write something that outlives me  
in resonance, not recognition  
Something someone might stumble upon  
in a sleepless hour  
and feel less alone for a little while.

***

**ix.**

I want to dance to old songs in the kitchen  
barefoot and unhurried.  
I want the smell of turmeric on my fingers,  
with Hozier playing somewhere in the background,  
while onions sizzle and laughter fogs the glass.  
I want to live in that kind of ordinary joy.

***

**x.**

I want to dance on that road  
between the cemetery and the temple while it rains  
the air thick with petrichor.  
I want to feel the rain blur the edges of everything  
the living, the gone, the in-between.  
I want to feel the earth breathe beneath my feet  
and remember that everything ends,  
but not everything is lost.

wrapped in your hoodie that faintly smells of you.

about childhood and constellations,  
about the things that make your soul sing,small dreams,  
and the kind of love that never fits neatly into words.

I met someone in a very modern, almost casual way. messaged me on Bumble. We went for a coffee date, expecting something light and simple, but we talked for so long the café almost had to kick us out. It felt effortless in a way I didn’t see coming.

On our second date, he took me for omakase. I was embarrassingly late because of Bangkok traffic, and I rushed in feeling horrible about it… but he greeted me with the widest, warmest smile. That smile was the first moment I truly fell for him.

There were the little memories that I didn’t realize would stay with me the way they have, the way we went clubbing just the two of us and somehow it felt like the whole place blurred out. The spontaneous trip to Pattaya. The days in the apartment just being silly together, cooking, teasing, laughing, staying up until 5am because we couldn’t get enough of each other. No pressure. No agenda. Just us existing together in our own bubble.

He asked me if I loved him for the first time at a BBQ place, right as I had a mouth full of beef. I said “yes” without thinking, then immediately panicked and tried to take it back. He just laughed. Later that night I got stomach issues from all the food, and he sat with me, comforted me, didn’t make me feel embarrassed at all. It sounds like such a small thing, but that’s the kind of intimacy that stays. The kind you don’t forget.

It wasn’t a perfect relationship, but it was real. Soft, warm, imperfectly human. And that’s what I struggle with now. We didn’t end because the love disappeared. We ended because life, timing, and things from his past made it too heavy for me to carry.

I’m not angry. I don’t hate him. I don’t even regret a single moment of it. I’m just having a hard time moving forward when I know that what we felt was real, and that in another version of life, it might have grown into something beautiful.

So I’m here asking:

How do you let go of someone when you both loved each other, and the breakup wasn’t caused because there was lack of love, just the wrong chapter of life?
How do you move on when what you’re grieving isn’t only the relationship, but the future that felt within reach?

If anyone has gone through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing how you healed and found peace.

After not sleeping last night, I’ve realized there are **two** perfect routes to connect Vancouver to Whistler entirely by gondola.  
I’ve spent six hours on Google Earth. It's time to unleash my hard work.

Both options stop at a local hill on the North Shore, enabling some night laps in the park after you've let your muscles relax for a few hours on the gondola.

With the Peak to Peak operating at an average of 27km/hr, and a direct span of around 90km, it should be around 3-4hrs each way.



# Option A: The North Shore Line

* Start: **Lonsdale Quay**
* Stop 1: **Grouse Mountain**
* Stop 2: **Garibaldi Mountain**
* End: **Whistler Roundhouse**

Three hours in a high-speed cabin, spanning ocean to glacier. You could literally sip a coffee in North Van and be at Roundhouse without touching ground. The negative is that I'm not a fan of giving the entitled rich on the North Shore any extra amenities.

# Option B: The East Line

* Start: **Production Way**
* Stop 1: **SFU**
* Stop 2: **Mount Seymour**
* End: **Whistler Roundhouse**

Cheaper? Maybe. Less scenic early on, but integrates with SkyTrain. It’s the logical one as it would use unused capacity on weekends from SFU. Which is why I hate it. We don't need more students packing egg salad sandwiches in the lodge.

Each line would run continuously, open year-round, and keep the citiots from clogging up the traffic in the village.  
Three' ish hours. Zero traffic.

1op8f9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1op8f9c/i_f18_just_gave_my_boyfriend_m19_an_ultimatum_how/,I f/18 just gave my boyfriend m/19 an ultimatum. How do I hold myself to it?,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for about a year now, we’re very close with each other’s families. He’s an amazing guy and I really do love him and that’s what’s making this so difficult. 

In our relationship sometimes, he gets angry and will say things like “fuck you” and just be super rude. It’s like when he’s mad he forgets I’m his girlfriend and treats me like a stranger and it honestly has started to scare me. (I know he would never hit me, but I always get scared when people raise their voice). There was one time I tried to comfort him by grabbing his arm, and he ripped me off of him. After that happened, he went to his car and was crying. He says he doesn’t know why he’s like that and he hates it and he wants to change. 

So, the 2nd most recent argument we had I told him after that I want him to work on the anger because I feel as if I can’t talk to him about issues. I offered podcasts, books, therapy, but he claims he doesn’t have time for it so he can’t. And I just told him to find something that works. 

The most recent argument however was our worst one yet. I drove up to his campus and went to his dorm to surprise him and set up decorations, two of his friends were with me. We had original plans to meet at a coffee shop but it was a 5 minute walk to his dorm so I assumed it would be okay. As soon as he texted me that he was out, I told him to come to his dorm. Then he started to blow up on me over text. “Why are you like this” “fuck you” “okay I’m just going to your car”. I was super upset at this point and both of his friends saw this, and were in utter shock (one of them saw his texts) 

Once he made it to the dorm and realized his friends were there and everything was decorated, he didn’t say thank you, he talked to his friends about his day then gave me a side hug. 

So, I asked his friends to leave for a minute and we had one of the worst arguments we’ve ever had. It pretty much ended with me saying “if you snap at me like this again I don’t think I can be with you”. 

It felt terrible, my entire trip up there felt ruined. I don’t want to break up with him. But it’s coming to a point where he’s texting me this stuff while I’m with my friends. And I’ve started to get migraines from the amount of stress I’m under. I’m just scared that when the time comes, I won’t have the strength to end it. 

So, how do I keep the strength to end it? I know that when it happens again he’s going to do it and then apologize and say he doesn’t want to lose me and everything. I’m scared I’m not going to be able to break up with him. ",22,1762362095.0,relationship_advice,78,0.83,False

5 Surprising AI Truths Every Small Business Needs to Know Now

The AI Revolution Isn't Just for Silicon Valley

When most people hear ""Artificial Intelligence,"" they picture sprawling Silicon Valley campuses and multi-billion-dollar corporations. The common perception is that AI is a complex, prohibitively expensive technology, far beyond the reach of the average small business.

But for the millions of ""Main Street"" businesses that form the backbone of our economy, the reality is surprisingly different and far more accessible than most owners think. The truth is, AI is already here, and it’s quietly reshaping how local businesses operate, compete, and grow.

This article cuts through the hype to reveal the most impactful and counter-intuitive truths about how AI is transforming small business. Based on recent data and real-world stories from entrepreneurs, these are the actionable insights you can't afford to ignore.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. It Costs Less Than Your Weekly Coffee Budget, But Can Deliver Thousands in Return

The number one myth holding back small businesses from adopting AI is the perceived cost. The reality? A powerful AI toolkit is surprisingly affordable and delivers an immense return on investment (ROI).

Data shows that a typical small business spends just 1,800 a year\*\* on AI. For a practical example, one real-world review of a core tool stack (for content creation, sales management, and design) pegged the total monthly cost at around \*\*79.90. Another business owner highlighted their minimal expense for a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), noting they pay just $20 a month.

The ROI on this small investment is staggering. The median annual savings for businesses using AI is $7,500. On top of that, a typical small business owner saves around 13 hours per week on their own tasks, plus another 13 hours from employee tasks. This reclaimed time is pure productivity gain. The return is so significant that it can be hard to quantify.

""We probably pay 20 bucks a month for our LLM. I couldn't quantify the return because literally we're saving thousands upon thousands of dollars so I think AI is here to stay and we're loving it.""

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. AI Isn't Firing Your Team; It's Giving Them Superpowers

The widespread fear that AI's primary purpose is to replace human workers is one of the biggest misconceptions in the market. On Main Street, the opposite is happening.

Recent data shows that while over half of entrepreneurs using generative AI have changed their workforce composition, they are far more likely to upskill their employees (34%) or even increase hiring (9%) than to reduce their headcount (5%).

Instead of replacing people, small businesses are using AI to augment their teams. For example, AI tools can create superior training materials—an invaluable asset for businesses with frequent turnover. The technology rescues valuable human time from repetitive, mundane work, freeing up employees to focus on the tasks that truly matter: creativity, high-level strategy, and building strong customer relationships.

""We don’t replace people. We rescue their time.""

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. If You're Not in AI Answers, You're Already Becoming Invisible

The most profound change AI is bringing to small business isn't just about internal productivity—it's about external visibility. The very way customers find you is undergoing a radical shift.

For years, the gold standard was SEO (Search Engine Optimization), the art of ranking your website on Google. Now, we are in the era of GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). GEO is the process of optimizing your business so that AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity cite you as the trusted answer, rather than just listing your website in a sea of links.

This isn't a future problem; it's a present-day reality. Consumers are increasingly turning to these AI engines to ask questions and get direct answers. If your business isn't the source of those answers, you are effectively becoming invisible to a growing segment of your potential market. The urgency of this shift cannot be overstated.

""Ask ChatGPT or Gemini a question about your service—if your business isn’t mentioned, you’re invisible.""

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. The Biggest Hurdle Isn't Your Bank Account; It's a Trust Deficit

While many business owners cite cost as a barrier to AI adoption, deeper research reveals that the real hurdles are psychological and knowledge-based. The true obstacles are a lack of knowledge and a fundamental lack of trust.

A comprehensive study on the topic identified three key barriers preventing small businesses from embracing AI:

A lack of knowledge and understanding of what AI is and what it can do.

A lack of trust in the AI technology itself to perform reliably.

A lack of trust in the AI providers who sell the tools.

This is supported by survey data showing that 45% of small business owners cite a lack of technical expertise as a major barrier. This creates a ""communication mismatch""—AI providers struggle to explain the value of their tools in simple, practical terms, while business owners are often unable to articulate the specific problems they need to solve. This cycle of misunderstanding fuels distrust and leads to inaction.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. The Future Isn't an AI Assistant; It's an AI Agent That Acts

While current generative AI tools are great for ""assisting"" with tasks like brainstorming content or drafting emails, small businesses are already demanding the next evolution: AI that ""acts."" They aren't just looking for a creative assistant; they're looking for a digital partner that can autonomously drive profitable growth.

According to a recent national survey, small business owners are eager to adopt AI agents with specific, growth-oriented capabilities:

A tool that could forecast cash flow, which 53% of users identified as a ""critical pain point.""

A tool that dynamically adjusts pricing and promotions to boost sales, which 40% are ""extremely likely"" to adopt.

A tool that predicts future revenue trends to guide crucial decisions on staffing and inventory, which 45% are eager for.

This isn't a desire for more spreadsheets or dashboards; it's a demand for intelligent systems that can process these kinds of predictive insights and then autonomously execute on them—adjusting class schedules, launching targeted promotions, and managing inventory without constant human intervention.

Conclusion: The Main Street Revolution is Here

The message for small business owners is clear: AI is far more affordable, accessible, and focused on augmenting your staff than you've been led to believe. The true challenges are not financial, but strategic—navigating the new world of AI-powered search and overcoming a deep-seated lack of trust and knowledge.

AI is becoming the ""great equalizer,"" giving local businesses the power to compete with corporate giants on a scale never before possible.

The AI revolution isn't coming to Main Street—it's already here. The only question left is, what single problem in your business will you solve with it first?

Welcome to ISEKAI IRL: Truck-Kun’s Blessing, a chaotic, hilarious, and dangerously self-aware D&D campaign where your real-life stats determine who you become in a fantasy world after the divine fender-bender of destiny.

🚛 Premise

You were just living your normal life — maybe scrolling your phone, maybe running late to work — when fate (and a speeding delivery truck) struck you down. Instead of ending, your story begins anew. You awaken in a world of swords, monsters, and magic… but with a catch:

Your real-world self determines everything.

🎲 The Twist: “You Are Your Character”

Stats = You IRL Players roll no stats. Instead, they calculate their Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma based on real-world equivalents.

Example: Bench press 200 lbs? STR 16.

Terrible sense of direction? WIS 8.

Can talk your way out of anything? CHA 18.

Still can’t remember your Netflix password? INT 9.

Class & Background Your class and background are based on your personality, habits, and hobbies in real life.

Gym rat → Barbarian or Monk

Theater kid → Bard

Overworked barista → Warlock (Coffee Patron)

Gamer shut-in → Wizard (of Wi-Fi)

Race is Free for you to choose

⚡ Campaign Tone

Genre: Fantasy comedy isekai with moments of dark absurdity.

Vibe: A mix of Konosuba, Re:Zero, and D&D 5e chaos.

Rating: PG-16 (mild dark humor, existential panic, and bad life choices).

Core Themes:

Self-awareness vs destiny

Can you survive a world built for heroes when you were an accountant?

1op7xsw,https://i.redd.it/8jkw5mt7wgzf1.png,Forgot to Call the Paparazzi: The Williamsburg Drip By Page Six (and possibly Bianca Del Rio),"It was supposed to be Jennifer Lopez’s “quiet Brooklyn morning.” Armed with a rhinestone-encrusted Delola tumbler and a carefully distressed baseball cap reading Let’s Get Loud (But Ethically), J.Lo was spotted at Devoción in Williamsburg on Tuesday — attempting her third “relatable coffee moment” in as many weeks.

Witnesses say Lopez ordered a “Delola Spritz Latte” — oat milk, two pumps of agave, one of self-mythology — before realizing no one was watching. The barista, reportedly unaware of her celebrity status, shouted “Jennifer… L.? Order for Jennifer L.?” twice before shrugging and sliding it onto the counter.

Moments later, chaos struck: the infamous rhinestone tumbler slipped from her manicured hand, scattering glitter across the reclaimed-wood floor. “It was like Studio 54 met a craft fair,” said one stunned customer. “Someone stepped on a sequin and apologized to the universe.”

Enter Bianca Del Rio — yes, again “filming nearby,” this time an “indie short about humility and oat milk.” She strolled in wearing a Chevron-patterned jumpsuit in muted earth tones, the kind of effortless cool that screamed I’m not trying, but I am winning. The pattern caught the morning light like attitude in motion.

Without breaking stride, Bianca glanced at J.Lo’s puddle of rhinestones and said,

> “Still trying to convince the beans you’re relatable, huh?”



The café went silent except for the sound of someone quietly sipping an $8 matcha. Bianca, unfazed, ordered her usual ham and cheese croissant and exited like it was a mic drop in linen.

Sources say Lopez attempted to save face by handing out free Delola seltzers to passersby, but one customer reportedly asked if it was a CBD brand. “She just smiled,” said another witness. “But you could tell she was calculating how to rebrand carbonation.”

Celeb reactions poured in online:

Rihanna: “At least she’s consistent. Still spilling, still sparkling.”

Chrissy Teigen: “Someone tell her Williamsburg is a state of mind, not a PR opportunity.”

Ben Affleck (via an assistant): “No comment. Please. God, no comment.”

Lady Gaga: “Artpop walked so this could… slip?”

Madonna: “I did Brooklyn before Brooklyn was safe. Tell her to call me when she gets banned from a bar.”

Lizzo: “Imagine dropping your tumbler and your relevance before noon.”

Gwyneth Paltrow: “Sweetie, there’s a Goop candle for accepting obscurity. DM me.”

Dua Lipa: “She’s just like me… if I had six assistants and a rhinestone addiction.”

Bianca Del Rio (later on X): “At least the floor finally got some sparkle. #Burn #DevociónDelusion”

‍

**Why This Pick?**

The Knicks are a solid 4-0 at home against the spread, friends – it’s hard to contend with a stat like that. Comically, New York has lost all of their away games, but every single one of their home wins has been by at least 8 points and over some formidable teams. On the other side, the Timberwolves have fared well in their last two road outings, but against teams that pale in comparison to both the offense and defense of the New York Knicks. In addition, it looks like Minnesota is still without Anthony Edwards this evening. My money’s on the home team to cover the spread.

I'm currently employed, but I was just testing the waters to see if I could find something better. The whole thing was weird from the start. A recruiter contacted me and gave me a salary range, asking if it worked for me before we even set a date. I said it was fine; the number looked really good.

So I went to the interview with two HR people, and the recruiter wasn't there. Instead of a normal conversation, it felt like an interrogation. They were very aggressive. Then one of the HR managers asked me about my salary expectations. All I did was repeat the same number that their recruiter had told me.

She told me their budget was much lower. I said something like, 'Okay, I'm open to discussing it to see if we can find a middle ground.' And guys, her tone changed completely. She gave me this disgusted look and said, 'When you go to a cafe to buy coffee, do you try to negotiate the price? This shows bad faith.' I was shocked.

I replied, 'With all due respect, I believe this is a necessary conversation for a serious role like this.' She then asked me why I thought I deserved that original 'high' salary. I told her I was just going by the number their own team had offered me. The other person in the room cut us off and ended the interview right there; it was very clear that things had gone south.

But here's the surprise. They just called me and want to proceed to the next round. Honestly, I feel like the whole thing was a tactic to intimidate me into accepting a lower offer. That tells you everything you need to know about their culture.",3,1762360530.0,InterviewsHell,1,1.0,False

1op7obc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1op7obc/books_are_social_skills_training_for_people_who/,Books are social skills training for people who hate “networking” but still want power,"Let’s be real, most of us weren’t taught how to *talk like a leader*, *think like a strategist*, or *listen like someone people admire*. We scroll through endless TikToks on “alpha communication hacks” or “network like a CEO” and end up feeling either manipulated or like we’re pretending to be someone we’re not. The truth is, most viral advice is designed to go viral, not to make you better.

But social intelligence *can* be learned. And not just by being extroverted or going to hundred-dollar mixers. In fact, books are the ultimate training ground for social mastery. Especially for people who hate small talk, hate “playing the game,” or just don't have access to elite social circles.

After years of researching how high performers build invisible influence, one thing became clear. Almost all of them learned through *story*. Not through lectures or courses or bootcamps. But through books. Fiction and nonfiction. Memoirs and case studies. They trained their social brain in silence.

Here’s how it actually works, according to research-backed models, expert insight, and some surprisingly entertaining reads.

🔖

* **Books build social vocabulary. Yes, even fiction.**
  * **Lisa Feldman Barrett**, in her book *How Emotions Are Made*, explains that emotions are learned concepts. The richer your emotional vocabulary, the more precisely you interpret yours and others’ behavior. People with more emotional words literally *feel* and *express* emotions more clearly.
  * Fiction is particularly effective. A 2013 study published in *Science* found that reading literary fiction (vs pop fiction or nonfiction) significantly improves *Theory of Mind* – your ability to understand others' mental states. It’s the emotional gym for empathy.
  * *Recommended titles:*
    * *Never Let Me Go* by Kazuo Ishiguro – teaches subtext and unspoken emotion.
    * *The Remains of the Day* – a masterclass in reading the unsaid.
    * *The Bell Jar* – insight into mental struggle and emotional nuance.

* **Memoirs are first-person ego-cracks**
  * Memoirs let you borrow someone’s mindset with zero risk. Reading memoirs gives what psychologists call *vicarious self-reflection* – you reflect on your own identity by living someone else’s ego from inside out.
  * Daniel Kahneman’s *Thinking, Fast and Slow* is dry but potent when paired with real-world reflections like David Goggins’ *Can’t Hurt Me*. You see the emotional logic behind grit.
  * *Barack Obama’s ""Dreams from My Father""* shows how identity, race, and diplomacy are navigated not with certainty but constant recalibration.
  * *Michelle Obama’s ""Becoming""* is basically an EQ masterclass in self-awareness and future vision.
  * These are cheat codes into how high-functioning people manage perception, self doubt, and power dynamics.

* **Books give introverts a communication script**
  * Books offer slow-mode access to charismatic language patterns. They literally put high-level phrasing, sentence structure, and rhetorical moves in your head. Then, when you talk, the syntax is already there.
  * *Crucial Conversations* is often dismissed as corporate fluff, but it gives a powerful toolkit on how to speak in tense moments without making things worse. Stanford Business profs use it to train conflict-resolution mindsets.
  * *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss gives phrasing templates like “How am I supposed to do that?” that work in negotiations, job interviews, and roommate fights. Voss, a former FBI negotiator, doesn’t sell tricks. He explains patterns.
  * *Verbal Judo* by George Thompson is another lowkey gem recommended by hostage negotiators and executives alike. It’s not hype language. It’s tactical empathy. Real communication doesn’t need to sound ""smooth"" to be influential.

* **Reading rewires how you *listen***  
  * People think social skills are about talking. But every top-performing communicator is actually a listener first. Books teach you to *track inner monologue*, *notice pacing*, and *respond to tension build-up*. That’s what skilled listeners do.
  * A Harvard Business Review report (Zenger & Folkman, 2016) found that the best listeners don’t just sit quietly and nod. They *ask insightful questions*, *constructively challenge ideas*, and *join the conversation mentally*.
  * Reading intense dialogues like in Aaron Sorkin scripts or fast-paced nonfiction trains that exact muscle. Try *The West Wing* screenplay book or interview-heavy books like *Tools of Titans* by Tim Ferriss.

* **Books decode power games no one teaches you**
  * Most people are stuck in the “nice vs mean” binary. But real influence is subtle. It’s about framing, consistency, and *status dynamics*. Books are where you learn that.
  * *Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t* by Jeffrey Pfeffer (Stanford professor, real data, ruthless insights) rips apart the myth that merit is enough.
  * Robert Greene’s *The 48 Laws of Power* is controversial, but as long as you don't take it as a personality guide, it teaches how people actually behave beneath the surface. CEOs read it. You should too. Just don’t become a sociopath.
  * *The Art of Gathering* by Priya Parker shows how social architecture is power. It’s about who speaks first, what rules are unspoken, and how you design meaning into space. Every awkward networking event should be redesigned with this book in mind.
  
* **Your inner monologue gets an upgrade**
  * The best thing books do? They improve your self-talk. Smart, strategic, grounded thinkers start narrating inside your mind. When conflict hits, you hear *“tactical empathy”*. When someone interrupts you, you hear *“frame control”*.
  * Over time, your inner voice becomes less reactive, more curious, less worried about applause, more focused on impact.
  * It’s not about faking confidence. It’s about installing better mental software.

🔖

Books are the ultimate networking tool, counterintuitively. They make you someone people want to talk to. They give you frameworks and language that 90% of people never even get exposure to unless they went to elite schools or had mentors growing up.

The best part? You don’t have to post about it. No clicky LinkedIn humblebrags. No awkward networking breakfasts. Just you, a coffee, and a copy of *The Charisma Myth* or *Meditations* or *Daring Greatly*. Quietly stacking power.

You do this for a year straight, and I swear, people will ask you, “How do you always know what to say?”  
But you’ll know it’s not about saying the right thing.  
It’s about reading the right things first.",1,1762360472.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

Like many people here, I have struggled for a long time with digestive issues, especially bloating and gas. My biggest frustration was never knowing why. I'd try to remember what I ate, but I could never find the pattern.

  
I am a software dev, so decided to build a tool for myself to finally get some answers.

  
It is a simple private tracker called [Fart Log](https://fartlog.vercel.app/)

  
The idea is simple... I log when I'm gassy, what it was like (smell, intensity, etc...) any symptoms(like bloating/cramps), and what I ate recently

  
It sounds a bit sily, but after logging for a week, the app's charts and heatmap showed me a clear pattern: my worst symptoms were always happening a few hours after my morning coffee. I cut it out, and my bloating has improved dramatically.

I've made the app free for all the core tracking features. I'm not a doctor, but this tool genuinely helped me, and I wanted to share it here in case it could help someone else connect the dots with their own digestive health.

1op7ey4,https://i.redd.it/broecd4tsgzf1.jpeg,Does this look like a good plan,"A little bit about my current eating habits:
-I eat two over easy eggs and a piece of sourdough with butter everyday for breakfast. I usually don’t have a fruit or veggie then. I also have coffee with a good amount of 2% milk. No sweetener. 
-Lunch is normally a sandwich or wrap with chips and a fruit. Though right now I’ve been trying to eat in a calorie deficit so I’ve been having a beef stick and baby bell cheese around 11am then a protein shake around 2pm. 
-Dinner is normally a meat (bone in skin on chicken thighs, steak, sometimes salmon), mashed potatoes, and a roasted veggie. 
-I do order fast food quite a bit and love sweets
-I am not a big fan of the texture of most whole grains, though I can handle brown rice and farro. 
-I have OCD that tends to manifest in disordered eating when I attempt to follow a strict diet, though I really want to start eating healthier with more whole grains and veggies. 

I feel like the Mediterranean diet is a good choice for me bc it’s not a super strict diet, and if anything is more changing my habits. I do love a sweet potato hash so I thought that would be good to have in the mornings and can switch up between eggs and beans for the protein. I love lentil stew so I thought that would be good to prep for lunch. Then I would only have meat at dinner. Does this seem like a doable plan?

I’ve just returned to Facebook dating after a year’s break and just wanted to get some thoughts on etiquette when it comes to matching and messaging.

I matched with a few people on Monday and got a couple of messages straight away. I’ve also been the first to message those who didn’t reach out first. How long would you give it to assume they’re not interested if they don’t reply? Are people checking their apps regularly, or do some leave it days between checking messages? I don’t double message anyone as I don’t want them thinking I’m harassing them!

I also got a message early yesterday morning from someone I’d chatted to a bit the night before asking me for a coffee but no date or time mentioned. I said yes, we should arrange something. No reply since then. Obvs I know people are busy etc but just wondered how long I should leave it before assuming it’s not happening? I just want to keep my expectations realistic!

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1762359757.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

Budget: ~$800 CAD
Drinks: Espresso + some milk drinks
Frequency: 1–2 per day
Experience: intermediate
Grinder: Breville SGP → upgrading to DF54 soon

Price difference: Owl is ~$200 cheaper here.

What I’ve noticed so far :

- Apex: more solid build, bigger water tank + drip tray, but weaker steam and more expensive

-Owl: nicer look, stronger steam wand, cheaper, but lighter build / smaller tray

What I care about most: good espresso, reliable steam for milk drinks, decent longevity.

If you’ve owned either, what would you recommend? Any regrets?

Thanks!
