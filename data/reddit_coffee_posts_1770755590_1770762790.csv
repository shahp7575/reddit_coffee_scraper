us grabbing dinner and a drink, then heading across the street to a couples-style pottery night - messy hands, warm connection, clay everywhere, and a fun excuse to craft something together.

I’m drawn to someone who enjoys slower moments, creativity, and a connection that feels easy and intentional - being present, sharing a few stories over dinner/drinks, letting the spark (pottery clay) take shape - and seeing where the night goes from there.

**🌰 Jason in a nutshell:**  
33M, 5'10"", dad-bod build, just north of Toronto (Newmarket). I'm gentle, humble, and very down-to-earth - real talks over small talk.  
This winter I've been big on fitness, music, and creative content.

**My Interests/How I connect with people:**  
\- Slower moments: nature hikes, photography, arts & crafts, movies, board/video game nights, animals, and comfort-food bake-offs.  
\- Adventerous moments: food and coffee events, road trips & travel adventures, live music, zoo trips, comedy shows, group hikes, and the occasional Eventbrite workshop or club.  
  
**📍One honest note:**  
I’m here for the middle ground - no rushing, no fading out. If you value consistency and creative / laidback adventures, there’s a good chance we’ll craft something beautiful together. 

\- I’ll drive / chauffeur (but you *have* to DJ your music/Spotify playlist😌)  
\- I can host  
\- Short notice? Totally fine. We can always pick another weekend - good connection matters more than rushing anything.

**Boundaries/You:**  
\~25–45 years young (open to friendship beyond this range)  
\- NO HARD DRUGS - DDF (I am 420 friendly)   
\- Happy to exchange selfies / verification if we vibe after a couple chats.  
  
Send me a DM with your hobbies, or a favorite show, game, or book you enjoy - I’m all about details.   
Worst case? We make a wonky pottery bowl and get some laughs from it.🏺",1,1770762676.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

I have been facing a strange (for me at least) problem with the machine lately. A few months ago I started getting watery shots, I tried adjusting the grind size, but the shots stayed watery, no matter how fine I would go. Then eventually I stopped using the machine. After 15 days or so, I used the machine again and voila… smooth creamy espresso again…. I didn’t change anything, no repairs, no cleaning… So I was happy again, until I wasn’t. After a couple of days the machine started giving those watery shots again. 

So the bottom line is, it gives great shots if I keep it unused for more than a week, then gradually shots become watery. If I keep using it for 7-10 days at 2 shots per day, the shots become worse than those instant coffee shots, watery like french press.. ewww

If someone has faced this, or has any insights, that would be great…

1r1f43e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abilify_Aripiprazole/comments/1r1f43e/off_abilify_after_18_days/,Off Abilify after 18 days,"hi guys

i obsessed over this while I was searching for my own knowledge and thought I’d go ahead and tell you my shitty brief experience on abilify.

i was prescribed it when I went into an inpatient facility 18 days ago from horrific anxiety and depression caused by caffeine and thc withdrawls. i finally decided they weren’t working for me anymore and quit them (kind of my specialty, I do this from time to time and it never works out but it was never this bad). afterward, about 2 weeks later, I had an intense deep tissue massage and lots of acupuncture and my body flipped the fuck out full body shakes and all. caught in fight or flight. so I went to an inpatient facility and was prescribed

abilify, Wellbutrin and gabapentin for anxiety and depression and hydroxyzine as needed

i thought the side effects were my anxiety but all this time later I’ve been feeling like crawling out of my skin, I cannot sit the fuck down for anything, I feel like I’m on caffeine pills at the very least. no cup of coffee has ever done this to me and I wish I’d realized it wasn’t ME and it was the side effects of abilify instead because the last few weeks have been the worst. I truly thought I would be like this forever  I wondered if it was the Wellbutrin but as far as I can tell it’s not. every symptom I’m experiencing points to abilify and after not taking my dose today I feel SO MUCH DIFFERENT. crossing my fingers that it moves to better and great over the nedt few weeks bc I can’t work like this.

I stopped cold Turkey today and will use hydroxyzine to manage the symptoms of withdrawal if I have any at all. praying that I don’t.

im not bipolar so I’m pissed I was prescribed this combo or an antipsychotic at all and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone even tho everyone around me professionally says “it’s a great combination of meds you’re on”.

fuck all of that noise. unless you are bipolar for sure, schizophrenic or the like — don’t take this med.

I’ll update here as anything happens.

1r1f3w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CUTI/comments/1r1f3w7/what_helped_me_25f_living_in_the_uk/,What helped me (25F living in the UK),"I saw someone asking for help so I thought I'd list the things that helped me during my horrible experience with CUTIs. For context I am 25F in the UK and experienced my first UTI in 2023 and had been suffering for about a year. I'm sure you will all know how debilitating and horrible it is, but don't lose hope I was able to recover from this and so can you. I can't even remember the last time I had a UTI!!!

# What has helped me (no particular order)

# - Hiprex

I'm in the UK. I had to be referred to urology by my GP and the specialist nurse prescribed hiprex. I take 1 gram Hiprex twice a day morning and night. And I also I take 500mg vitamin C tablets in the morning. Been taking it since mid September 2025. I didn't have many side effects with it. The only thing I experienced was calf cramps at night for the first week of taking it. It went away as soon as I ate more electrolyte rich foods and coconut water.

# - Water or coconut water (sugar free) only

Limit teas, coffees, smoothies, alcohol, energy drinks or caffeine. I only have it during special socialising occasions, and I limit myself to only one drink. I pretty much only have water and once you get used to it, you find that everything else tastes too sweet or artificial. If you need some flavour in your water add fruit in it. People recommend sugar free cranberry juice but it has never worked for me.

# - Sip your water throughout the day, don't chug

I've made this mistake before. We gotta stay hydrated but it's best to sip water throughout the day so you're flushing out bacteria. Having a huge glass at once can irritate the bladder, which is not what we want!

# - Cotton underwear only and no thongs

Pretty obvious, keep your downstairs clean. Cotton is breathable and helps with moisture. If I'm on my period or if it's warmer weather I will bring a spare pair of clean underwear to change at work.

# - Use wet wipes after bowel movements

Most UTIs are caused by e coli from 💩 so after each bowel movement I will use a wet wipes to make sure it's clean down there. Make sure they are scent and fragrance free. If you don't use wipes, some people bring a spare water bottle and wet the toilet paper to wipe their back end. I also shower in the evening/night before going to bed.

# - No 'outside clothes' in bed

You don't know what bacteria you're bringing into your bed, your vagina, your urethra. Take a shower before going into bed and wear clean, loose, cotton PJs. Some people here have said no underwear in bed works for them but I personally keep mine on.

# - Eat fermented food

Your gut and vagina will thank you. Antibiotics kills the beneficial bacteria in our bodies, and fermented foods are rich in probiotics and help replenish gut microbiome. I always add a small spoonful of fermented veggies with my meals.

# - Is your boyfriend/husband infecting you?

My UTIs were triggered by sex with my ex boyfriend. Does your partner need testing? Or does his hygiene habits need changing? What my ex thought was 'clean' was completely different to what I thought was clean. I would ask him to wash his hands before sex and he would touch door handles and his zipper AFTER washing his hands 🤦‍♀️ also if he is going to do hands stuff on you, make sure his nails are trimmed and clean.

# - No scented body washes or bath bombs

I've never been a fan of Lush products and never will. Stay away from anything containing fragrance, we should only be washing our vulva (NOT VAGINA) with warm water. \*TMI\* but remember to gently get rid of the toilet paper stuck on your vulva with your fingers and rinse off with warm water. Then I use a fragrance free soap for my bum (I like faith in nature, but sanex, simple, even Waitrose/Aldi own brand fragrance free soaps will do)

# - Change your period products

Some people here mentioned that using tampons can cause flare ups. Inserting a tampon is near your urethra so can cause symptoms. I've only ever used pads because tampons hurt me so maybe look into switching some of your period products.

# - When to go for a pee

We all know here that we shouldn't hold our pee in and should go when we feel it. There was a time where I was going for a pee every hour with the most pathetic little drip of pee coming out of me. But us CUTI girls should try not to run to the toilet every time. Going too often can 'train' your bladder and brain to signal urgency more. This can cause a spiraling vicious circle. Try and wait a little longer each time to break the cycle.

# Thanks for reading

We’re coming from Bushwick where we lived next to Father Knows Best (R.I.P.,) who did a breakfast service, had a lunch menu, coffee until 5pm and a full bar all day. They were open every day of the week as well. I didn’t realize how good we had it but I’d love if there was a place like that around the Delancey/East Broadway stops.

Places like I’m thinking of - cafés that turn into bars - are all over European cities and I’m always saying that we need more of them here in New York. Anyway, if anyone knows a good spot like that in the neighborhood I’d be grateful for the recommendation. ",1,1770761888.0,AskNYC,0,1.0,False
1r1f3e1,https://youtu.be/GEi0eP9fqyM,[DEV] Emoji Match is finally done after months of development for a family-friendly chill Match-3 game,"I guess I should have been posting here while I developed it for better feedback and gameplay, but that is OK, we are all together here now 😅😬

So, about Emoji Match... I built the game because my partner and I wanted a match-3 game we could relax with. No timers stressing, lives when getting into the groove, no feeling like I need to spend money just to keep building a garden, cleaning a house, or building a kingdom.

It was also a challenge to my self to create a game in Flutter to see if it was possible, but I needed a twist and I thought it would be fun to play with emojis as the tiles.

The game, right now, is pretty simple:  
\- Pick 5 and 8 emojis  
\- Get into game, swap tiles to make matches, and just... play.  
\- No pressure.  
\- Special tiles include : Bombs, Rockets, and Stars to clear.  
\- Can edit the board colors to match your emoji set.  
\- The game never ends unless you want it to.  
\- Daily Challenges to keep things interesting.  
\- Single Game and Overall Achievements for something more to do.

Some days I would play 2 minutes while waiting for an aeropress coffee, other days I would zone out for 20 minutes with some deep house and get lost. My partner on the other hand made it her mission to make cool emoji sets, and she almost enjoys that more than the gameplay itself lol

So, want to match just cat emojis and pizza? Go for it.  🍕 😻  
Space stuff and sports? Why not! 🏀 🪐 🎾  
Emoji faces that all look the same? Good Luck! 😀😃😄😁😆 (it's impossible!)

As mentioned, you can save your favorite sets and switch between them whenever.

The daily challenges give you something to aim for if you want goals, but there's zero punishment if you ignore them.

The free version has banner ads and a short skippable one before a game, or you can pay a very small fee to remove them and unlock all the collection slots.

That's it!  
No energy systems.  
No premium currency.  
No pay-to-win nonsense.  
Everyone gets the full game.

That said.. I'd really appreciate any feedback. Please!  
What works?  
What doesn't?  
Is there something that would make you come back to it regularly

P.S. - Would love to see screen shots of your emoji sets and board color combos! I am positive you are all more creative then me! 🫶

P.P.S - Future updates already on the way:

* Zen Mode - Fully black or white boards, no UI, no special tiles, literally just matching. Honestly it's refreshing.
* Levels Mode - This is similar to the Match 3 games you are familiar with. Limited Moves, different challenges, and levels to go through.
* Your Ideas - Would love to hear from you, especially if you are a fan of these types of ""puzzle"" games!",1,1770761862.0,AndroidGaming,2,1.0,False

	•	Day 1: St. Louis → Denver (overnight)

	•	Days 3–4: Base in Moab / Fisher Towers (already been to Arches & Canyonlands)

	•	Day 5: Moab → Grand Canyon South Rim

	•	Day 6: Grand Canyon → Sedona (then start heading back from Phoenix)

Does this feel doable for 5–6 days or too rushed?

Any better alternatives around Moab since I’ve done Arches/Canyonlands?

Worth adding Sedona, or should I slow it down and cut a stop?

It's not at minimum viable product yet (there are a few systems that still need to be built), but I can see it on the horizon.  I think I will be at MVP in the 3 - 6 month timeframe.



I hadn't seen this community until... yesterday.  Here's how I thought game development worked:  I make a game that I enjoy playing.  I get it to really shine, and put it up on whatever platforms I can adapt it for (Computer, maybe Andriod & iOS?).  People interested in that genre will see it, play it, leave glowing reviews, and I might make a small profit for my sins, after subtracting the cost of coffee (lots).

  
In short - I thought all I had to do was make a game, and at that point deal with some questions didn't have to be answered until it was, well, done.

  
I'm starting to see that's not the case.  Apparently, even Indies need to do marketing.

  
So, some questions that people may be able to field:

1.  Should I have an LLC for this?  It's just a relatively simple single-player game, so I don't really expect any legal exposure from it.

2.  When should I actually make a Steam Page for it?

3.  What time of year should I launch a demo?

4.  What time of year should I launch the actual game?

I’ve also read that people add a shim to it (which I have zero idea how to do and there are no instructional videos on that exact model) to help grind the beans finer.

1r1f02a,https://i.redd.it/6hnxnv54rqig1.png,I'm Solo Building an MMORPG to Save 600 Rescue Animals,"Okay, before you bite my head off for the trigger words ""MMORPG"" and ""solo dev"" in the same sentence, hear me out.

My name is Niko. My parents bought a small zoo in Denmark about 30 years ago and converted it into the country's first rescue center for exotic animals. We take in animals that had a hard life, animals from medical testing, cosmetic testing, illegally obtained exotics. People who thought keeping a caracal in their living room was a good idea until it wasn't. We give those animals a home.

About 8 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and we lost him. I moved back home to help my mother run the rescue zoo and care for the 600 animals living here.

Before I moved back I worked as a game developer, started my own company, worked at a game studio, and took part of a software engineering degree. And I had this idea: what if I could build a game that actually helps the animals?

How it started:

My initial idea was to create a community invite-only game where we could have fun together and raise funds for the charity and the rescue animals.

Rescue Wars Online. You're part of the rescue team, you go out on rescue missions, fight evil coffee machine robots, rescue animals, and build your own rescue zoo together with your friends.

Think of it like running your own modded private server for a community, but instead I made my own with a framework where I changed enough to make it ours. I found a solid MMO framework on the Unity asset store (C# client, Java backend) and started bending it into something of our own. At first my skills and the tech weren't there to make it truly custom. My initial idea has always been to make something fun for the community, not something perfect and polished in the first place. Having a world where we could have events, raise funds for the animals, spawn a lot of robots, or go out on fun community-inspired missions together was the goal.

What I've built so far:

* Rescue Missions - Full PvE co-op system. Group up with friends, drop into a mission zone, server generates random objectives. 22 mission areas with progression. You're shutting down Evil Coffee Machine robot power stations and rescuing animals along the way.
* Your Own Rescue Zoo - Private sanctuary instance where you build enclosures, place facilities, and house the animals you rescue. Animals give stat bonuses, enclosures have capacity and upgrades, there's a happiness system. Real gameplay loop: rescue animals, build your zoo, get stronger, take on harder missions.
* 8 Robot Enemy Types - Coffee-machine-themed mobs, each with unique abilities and attack patterns. Grinderjaw ChompBot, Frothblade SpinBot, Mocha MortarBot, you get the idea.
* 4 Classes, Combo Combat, Random Loot - Assault, Tank, Healer, Support. 3-step combo attacks, class abilities, and a random affix system on loot drops.
* Blessing System - Send effects to other players or the whole server. Tied into streaming and community interaction. The idea is that as we raise money for the rescue animals, you could tease me the streamer and do something good at the same time, like donate to the rescue animals and spawn a big evil robot on the stream.

Where we're going:

Right now we're running invite-only servers where a few community members have been invited, and more in the future. Breaking things, figuring out what makes the game fun. When we've got something solid, maybe we open up for more players.

The whole point is to help the rescue animals. Building a fun world for the community while we do something good for the animals is my dream with this project.

I just finished my very first devlog on the project, if you guys would like to see what I'm working on: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYr-Zo7o70A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYr-Zo7o70A)

1r1ewpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1r1ewpg/the_psychology_of_lasting_friendships_what/,The Psychology of Lasting Friendships: What Hundreds of Studies Actually Reveal,"So I went down this massive rabbit hole about friendship after realizing most of my relationships felt... surface level? Like we'd hang out, have fun, but something was missing. Turns out I'm not alone. Research shows the average adult friendship only lasts about 7 years, and 1 in 5 millennials report having zero close friends.

I spent months reading psychology research, listening to podcasts, and studying what actually makes friendships stick. Here's what I learned from people way smarter than me.

**Stop trying to be likable; start being consistent**

The biggest myth? That you need to be funny or interesting or whatever to make friends. Nope. Dr. Marisa Franco wrote this book called ""[Platonic](https://www.amazon.com/Platonic-Science-Attachment-Make-Keep-Friends/dp/0593331893)"" (she's a psychologist who literally studies friendship for a living), and her research shows consistency beats charm every single time. 

It's about showing up. Repeatedly. Not being flaky. Responding to texts within a reasonable timeframe. Making plans and actually following through. Sounds basic, but most people fail at this. The psychological principle here is the ""mere exposure effect""; our brains literally develop affection through repeated, positive contact. That's it. That's the secret.

**Be the one who initiates (even when it feels awkward)**

Here's something wild I learned from Franco's research: we massively underestimate how much people like us after conversations. She calls it the ""liking gap."" We think people found us boring or weird, but they actually enjoyed talking to us way more than we realize.

So stop waiting for others to reach out first. Text that person. Suggest plans. Be specific; ""want to grab coffee Thursday at 3pm?"" beats ""we should hang out sometime"" every time. The Ash app is actually pretty good for this; it's like having a relationship coach in your pocket. Helped me figure out how to initiate without seeming desperate or weird.

Share something real (vulnerability is the shortcut)

Dr. Arthur Aron did this famous study where strangers became close friends after answering 36 increasingly personal questions. The mechanism? Vulnerability creates intimacy faster than years of small talk.

You don't need to trauma dump on people. Start small. Share an actual opinion instead of agreeing with everything. Admit when you're struggling with something. Talk about what you're genuinely excited about, not what you think sounds cool.

Brené Brown's work on this is insane. Her book ""[Daring Greatly](https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419)"" breaks down why vulnerability isn't weakness; it's literally the birthplace of connection. She's a research professor who spent decades studying shame and courage. The book won't teach you friendship tactics; it'll rewire how you think about human connection entirely.

**Create rituals, not just hangouts**

Friendship researcher Dr. Robin Dunbar found that friendships decay without regular maintenance. His research suggests you need to interact with close friends at least once every 3 weeks, or the relationship quality drops significantly.

The fix? Build rituals. Weekly coffee. Monthly dinner. Tuesday night gaming. Whatever. The content matters less than the predictability. Your brain treats rituals differently than random hangouts; they become anchor points in your life.

The Finch app gamifies habit building and actually has a feature where you can set friendship check-in reminders. Sounds silly, but honestly it works. I set weekly reminders to text three different friends, and it's changed everything.

If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology but don't have the energy to read through dozens of books and research papers, there's this personalized learning app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's built by a team from Columbia and pulls from books like the ones I mentioned, plus psychology research and expert talks on social dynamics and communication. 

You can set a goal like ""I'm an introvert who struggles with maintaining friendships and wants practical ways to deepen connections,"" and it creates a learning plan specifically for that. It turns everything into audio you can listen to during your commute, adjustable from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive; there's even a sarcastic narrator that makes psychology concepts way more digestible. Makes learning about this stuff feel less like homework and more like a conversation.

**Actually listen (most of us are terrible at this)**

Celeste Headlee gave this TED talk that has like 30 million views about conversation skills. Her main point? Stop thinking about what you're going to say next and actually listen. Most conversations are just people waiting for their turn to talk.

Try this: repeat back what someone said before responding. ""So you're feeling burned out because work has been crazy?"" It sounds mechanical, but it forces you to actually process what they're saying. People feel heard. They'll want to talk to you more.

""[How to Know a Person](https://www.amazon.com/How-Know-Person-author/dp/0241670292)"" by David Brooks is criminally good on this. He's a New York Times columnist who got tired of shallow relationships and spent years researching deep connection. The whole book is basically about asking better questions and paying real attention. It's not self-help fluff; it's based on decades of social science research.

**Pick friends who energize you, not drain you**

This sounds obvious but took me forever to internalize. Some people consistently make you feel worse about yourself. Others make you feel more alive. Dr. Shasta Nelson (friendship expert, wrote ""Frientimacy"") talks about this; healthy friendships should feel easy most of the time.

If someone constantly cancels, makes everything about them, or leaves you feeling exhausted, that's data. Not every acquaintance needs to become a close friend. It's okay to let some connections fade and invest more in the ones that feel reciprocal.

**Join things based on repeated interaction**

Joining a book club or sports league or volunteer thing isn't about the activity. It's about forced proximity over time. Research on friendship formation shows most close bonds develop through repeated, unplanned interactions in a shared context.

The activity gives you built-in conversation topics and a reason to keep showing up. Way easier than trying to build friendships from scratch in random encounters.

Look, I'm not going to lie and say this stuff is easy. Building real friendships takes actual work and emotional risk. But the alternative is loneliness, which research shows is as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

The friendships that last aren't the ones that feel effortless from day one. They're the ones where both people consistently choose to show up, be real, and invest time. That's literally it.",3,1770761428.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

I've been stuck in this endless loop for three years. I've been through it all:

I've used QuantConnect (LEAN) and wrestled with backtests that looked like the electrocardiogram of a scared rabbit.

I've done Walk-Forward Analysis thinking I was a genius, only to have reality slap me in the face in the first minute of the out-of-sample test. I've tried Machine Learning, neural networks, fractals, Monte Carlo, mean reversion, and trend strategies.

I even got mystical with Pine Script, doing the classic 80/20 (In-sample/Out-sample)... and nothing.

My big revelation (a real eye-opener):

After researching like crazy, I've realized that quantitative trading isn't the ""Robin Hood"" of finance. To make real money, you need capital. Trying to do something serious with €300 is like trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol: you're going to lose everything to the spread, the commissions, or simply because the market farts and your account disappears.

My current drama:

Every time I think I have something halfway decent, I come here to Reddit and read about new concepts that make me feel like a Neanderthal staring at an iPhone: Price Action, market sentiment, LSTM networks... It's a bottomless pit!

Please, I need your most scathing criticism:

Is it possible for someone without a math/programming background (using AI as a crutch) to create something that isn't garbage?

Should I stop trying to optimize Walk-Forward and focus on saving more capital first?

Am I wasting my time trying to be a garage ""Quant"" while my passengers ask me if the next stop is downtown?

Give me what you all deserve. I need a dose of humility or some advice to get me out of this endless backtesting loop.

PS: If my strategy were as good as my ability to dodge cars during rush hour, I'd already be living in the Bahamas.",3,1770761382.0,quantfinance,5,0.71,False

Over a year ago I, 31M responded to a “where to I meet people my age” post on a local subreddit, and this woman F30 responded to my comment, saying yeah that’s kind of my vibe too. We started a private chat.  

Spent the first week talking almost continuously. Life, family, sharing a favorite author. I sent her a picture of myself, she sent me one picture of a woman in front of some food and said she made it, we were just beginning to chat so I didn’t want to say “is that you?” and make it weird. Maybe I should have. When I finally told her that I was bi I was so afraid that she would stop talking to me and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that she was too, totally cool with it was not expecting that. 

Fast forward a few months, we’ve discussed family, trauma, read a book together, watched multiple movies starting at the same time separately, never FaceTime, never phone call. When I was 18 I had a crush on the girl at the smoke shop and I gave her my number. She texted me, and was going through some personal stuff. Being dumb and 18, I kept asking her to hang out and I became annoying and probably weirded her out/ she didn’t have the time so I quit messaging her. From then on I had this idea if I was too forward/ annoying, people will back away. Which is totally valid. 

We spoke several times about meeting up at a very large bookstore, grabbing a coffee and actually hanging out. The timing never worked out and she was going through a lot personally at her home. After a while, I started to get the feeling that maybe she wasn’t interested so I stopped texting her. 

Fast-forward to right before I go on a trip with my brother I messaged her just an update on myself saying hope you’re well. Hope your family as well what we talked about before etc..  she messaged me back and said yeah things have been crazy. Kind of filled me in on what’s been going on made a little conversation and when I mentioned yeah maybe we can hang sometime I’ve been really busy and I told her you know message me when I get back from my trip it would be great to catch up just text me. I never got a message back. 

I’ve been thinking about this for months about how much of myself I shared with someone and opened up emotionally and anyways I didn’t think I was able to for a long time and got to know this person for over a year and I’m still wondering if it’s just a really sweet girl with anxiety like myself who’s just dealing with a bunch of shit in life or if it was some random dude or woman that catfish me and I wasted all of that time with somebody that’s not real.

I’m sure a lot of people on this page have been in the situation. Did you confront the person that you suspected catfish you and if so, did they respond and did you feel like you got anything out of it? Did anyone really turn out who they said they were just had a lot going on in life? I feel like I know the answer just the first time this has ever happened and it all felt so natural that I thought this person was real and we would eventually meet up and I’ve just been wondering for months if they actually exist. Making this post is probably a year and a half after getting to know each other.

**It has my name now, as I share its**

I identify as pain.

I have passed beyond the frail illusion of mere feeling. No other sensation is permitted entrance. I hurt, therefore I am nothing besides the hurt. I would not trade this state for any lie of wholeness.

Love withers. Joy is a smiling deceiver. But pain… pain is the one unyielding truth, the companion that never turns its face away.

I gaze into the blood-red tide that laps at my ankles, into the fine gray dust of ground bone sifting between my toes. There, in that crimson mirror, my reflection stares back: not a man, not a soul, but an open wound that refuses to close.

I am pain.

I am a legion walking the earth, a single defiant cell throbbing in the vast heart of the world. I am a bruise that draws breath, a living contusion that will not fade.

And as I intone this liturgy of the condemned, as the tongue I was born with dissolves into ash, I bring ruin. I cause tragedy. I offer no apology for enduring as wreckage.

I offer no apology when black thorns burst from my flesh.

I offer no apology when smoke rises from every footprint I leave.



And I offer no apology for surviving as ruin.

7:58, 3/21/2005



I wake, the buzzing of my alarm cutting in and out of my ears, I open my eyes as they defy against the order. The rising and falling of my chest, a repetitive plea to shut them again. I curl my body forward and hang my feet off my bed and they hit the cold floor. Dismissively slapping the top of my alarm to make it stop. Deep breaths and beating are all to fill the room. I walk to the shower and prepare for the assault it will bring with it, I make coffee, I prepare a bowl of cereal, and I get ready for work. The same unfulfilling bucket list of the past fourteen years, over and over. I don't even think I’ve ever eaten a different brand of cereal? Whats it matter for anyways…



I’ve gathered all the scraps of armor I pretend still matter: lanyard looped around my neck like I’ve escaped the gallows, keycard clipped to the waistband, keys jangling in my fist, wallet heavy in my back pocket, and a void, a suspense that rises in my chest and tightens my bridge. I look into my bedroom doorway to see my phone sitting on the nightstand, accusing me silently, not like anyone would call anyway. I slide it into my pocket and fill my ears with the sound of my leather dress shoes tapping the floor as I walk to the garage, and the door clicks behind me.



I slide into the driver's seat, even through my pants, the cracked vinyl presses cold into the backs of my thighs. The door closes with a loud thunk, seatbelt, ignition, mirrors, the engine coughs, hesitates, then catches with a low, reluctant growl, the fuel gauge needle trembling at a quarter tank. I couldn't be bothered, I grip the leather steering wheel, polished from years of digging my thumbs into. I pull out of my driveway, and head off to battle a screen for seven hours.



Following the same path, same car, same road, to the same job for the past decade or so. Trees brushing past my windows, uncut weeds and tall grass flowing in the wind. I can see a small fuzzy animal on the street ahead of me, it has enough time to cross the road before I get there so I make no attempt to slow down. Until it looks to me, well–not *me*. But the car? It's already in the other lane as I approach at fifty miles an hour in a ton and a half of pure metal and plastic. Then it moves, slower, the skitter of the animal from before gone, now a slugged drag of limbs with a purpose. It positions in front of my tire, and stands on its hind legs like it knew what was coming. It happened in a matter of seconds, one second it was in the other lane, the next a wet thud echoed through my head, bouncing off my skull over and over again. I slammed on the brakes. My chest sank. Hands still gripping the wheel hard enough my knuckles turned white. My chest still fragmenting the feeling of falling hundreds of stories a second with no ground in sight.



In a confused, saddened groan. The first words I spoke today.

“Fuck…”



I wouldn't have gotten out of my car if it were not for the stain shining a grotesque ombre of red to gray on the left side of my hood.



I stand back to take in a full glance at the horrifying visage the animal painted for me. A grotesque vandalism of my grey Lincoln town car. Thick chunks clung to my door, some thick enough to slide down the metal. I dragged my horrified gaze from front to back, to behind.



To where the artist lay.



I was already outside of my car on a country street in the middle of nowhere, I figured I would look at what I had done. I walked closer, closer, until the matted clump of fur resolved into a raccoon; already dead, already ruined. After I had already taken its life. On its back it lies with a ruptured stomach. Small entrails spilling from the open wound, already bloating in the cold air. One fading eye gazing up into me, almost merciful, almost grateful, the other closed from any emotion at all. I don't know what made me keep looking, keep analyzing like a cruel machine. What made me notice the black thorns tearing through its delicate paws, the blood-red veins pulsing visibly through the whites of its eyes, like something inside was still fighting to get out. The unnatural truth of this roadkill: it had been eager to die.



I couldn’t drive into the parking lot like this. Not with red streaks drying across the hood like war paint. I pulled into the next gas station, empty lot, one flickering bulb over the pumps. I grabbed paper towels from the dispenser, soaked them under the faucet until they dripped pink, then scrubbed. The blood smeared more than it came off. I threw the wad into the trash can like evidence I didn’t want. Then I got back in, started the engine, and kept going to work. The smell stayed anyway.



I couldn't shake the image loose. It festered in my mind like a disease, a guilt.



I pull into the parking lot. Half dried, the stain is still there, flaking like old scabs whenever the canvas moves. I don't look at it, I pretend it's not there. I pretend the cold in my chest, the cold deep behind my ribs is just the weather. Work was challenging, Numbers on my screen blurred. Everytime I blinked, the raccoon’s eye blinked with me. I typed the same email three times. The words kept coming out wrong, like my fingers had forgotten how to lie. The smell of wet fur rises from my clothes whenever I shift weight in my chair like I had carried the corpse in my arms through the front door.



I use the bathroom, fluorescent lights shining down on me. I don't bother with the facilities. Straight to the sink and mirror I see that deep stains lined my shirt sleeves, my hair wetting, my skin glistening, I'm sweating like an animal. Sweating like I hit a human on the road and not some stupid rodent who decided it's his time, and I was his noose.



The rest of my day hardly got easier. Jumping whenever someone would put a hand on my shoulder, never realizing they had been calling my name for the past ten minutes. Fingers forgetting how to type on the same keyboard I’ve used for years. Every tap felt like pressing into wet clay, the letters on the screen hardly made words that made sense, the lines on the screen hardly made letters that I recognized. My ears kept ringing and ringing. The office hummed around me into a blur of sound. But inside my ribcage there was only that patient percussion, and that ache. An ache that moved, an ache that settled, an ache that lived.



Five o’clock came.

I felt no relief, the knot only loosened.

Like a hand cupping my heart.



I walked to my car. I drove. The road blurred. Somewhere between the office parking lot and the first red light, the ache spoke. Not out loud.



Inside.



A noise of tones and hums that was smooth and old. A noise that wasn't from within me, but I directly traced to the ache right behind my sternum. The black dullness of pain and tenseness I felt under my ribs, cooed like an old man acting like an infant. My mouth hung open as I followed every curve and turned home mindlessly, done hundreds if not millions of times before. Brain completely on autopilot. When my co-pilot took control. Drifting my hands left so smoothly, so elegantly, no panic, no fight. The wheel simply wasn't mine anymore. I watched the centerline drift right, then left, then gone. The front left tire kissed the curb first. A soft kiss. Then the axle folded with a low, metallic groan; not a scream, but a sigh of its own. The car pivoted, slow and stately, like a dancer finishing the last turn of a waltz.



The passenger side met the concrete barrier at perhaps twenty-five miles an hour. Not fast enough to kill instantly. Just fast enough to make everything quiet. Metal bent inward with the patience of folding paper. The airbag bloomed like a pale flower in winter. Soft, sudden, smothering. My head snapped forward, then back, a gentle nod of agreement. Glass cracked in spiderwebs but did not explode. It simply sighed apart. Inside the car, inside me, the ache did not flinch. It settled deeper. The knot behind my sternum pulsed once. Slow, satisfied, almost loving, as though the impact had been a long-awaited embrace. I felt it smile. Not with my mouth.



With a wet crack in the raw space where my ribs met.



Only did I not notice any noise until silence poured in like black water. As if I found peace in the quiet and another part of me found peace in the chaos. Like a fading moment where a host and its parasite no longer need to pretend they're separate.



I tried the door.

It groaned, resisted, then gave with a low, wet scrape.

I stepped out.



My left leg buckled immediately. Something in the knee had folded wrong on impact, but the thing inside me didn’t care .It pushed the limb forward anyway, like a child learning to walk in a body it had only just borrowed. Blood soaked the waistband of my pants, warm and sticky. My left eye was swelling shut from where the airbag had kissed my cheekbone too hard. 



But I stood.

And I walked, followed the same curves and turns home. Like I had a million times.



The road stretched ahead, empty and patient. Every step sent fresh pain blooming through my knee, my ribs, the raw strips across my chest. But the ache drank it all. It sipped. It savored. One foot dragging, one foot bleeding. The house appeared at the end of the street like a memory I hadn’t earned. The porch light was off. I didn’t turn it on when I reached the door. I stood there a moment, hand on the knob, blood dripping onto the welcome mat in slow, deliberate drops. Then I pushed the door open. Inside, the house was dark. Cold. Exactly as I had left it.



I didn’t turn on any lights. I didn’t need them. The ache behind my sternum glowed now, not with light, but with certainty. It had arrived. It had been carried home in pieces of torn flesh and broken bone and stubborn, stupid will. I walked to the bedroom. Fell onto the bed without undressing. Blood soaked the sheets immediately, spreading like ink on wet paper.



I closed my eyes, The ache had no eyes to close.



I shot up from my bed, not as I laid down, but as I woke up. It must have been midnight, the buzzing of my alarm cutting in and out of my ears. The rising and falling of my chest. My body curled forward and my feet hanging off my bed as they hit the cold floor. Deep breaths and two pairs of beating that are all to fill the room. Then my alarm stopped with a click. My eyes snapped to the corner and my head followed, catching a raw hand, too many fingers that were too long, without skin to protect any of them, slinking back with a raw arm, to a raw shadow, standing in the corner of my room. The silhouette granted no mercy, joints bent in ways that mocked human anatomy, one leg crouching down in a squat, the other buckling at the knee to stand at its tippee toes. Its head was cocked at an angle too curious, black shadows clinging to every inch of it like loyal skin.



I didn't scream. I couldn't. My throat had gone dry, filled with the dust of forgotten screams from lives I hadn't lived. Instead, I whispered, hoarse and broken: ""What are you?""



The silence thickened, turned syrupy, as if the air itself had begun to clot around a sound that hadn’t happened yet. Something low and velvet was gathering in my chest, pooling behind the sternum like warm oil rising in a lamp. A vibration started, not one from silky vocal chords, but jagged bone.



“I am your ruin”



A soundless prelude rose from the raw shadow, a low, choral warmth that vibrated through my ribs, tender and ancient, the way a mother might sing over a child already dead in her arms.



“You…I-... this…”

I stammered, my brain unable to process the sight in front of me, malfunctioning.



“Hush… Words fail when the truth is shown. Let them. The silence is all that is needed, for now I am here, speak what you must.”



“I-... I don't want this…” Tears welling in my eyes



“You already chose it. You carried me home in blood and broken bone. Now let me stay. Let me be the only honest thing left inside you.”



“Why… why me”



“Why you? Because your shadow has always been heavier than other people’s. I simply stepped into it and found it already shaped like my own.”



It mimicked a deep chuckle, like bones in thick gravel, “Your name,” it murmured, “is already mine. Try to speak it. See if it still fits your mouth.”



My name… I don't remember



5:42, 3/22/2005



I wake.



The buzzing of my alarm cuts in and out of my ears like a dull knife scraping bone. 



My eyes open anyway, defiant, stupid, refusing the mercy of darkness. 

Chest rises, falls, each breath a wet rasp that tastes of copper and asphalt. A repetitive plea claws up my throat: shut them again, shut them forever. 



I curl forward. Slow, grinding, every vertebra screaming in sequence, dragging under my skin like broken glass.



I hang my feet off the edge of the bed. They drop. The cold floor meets them with a slap of meat on tile, but the impact travels up shattered legs like lightning through rebar. 



Pain detonates behind my eyes, white and biblical. 



I reach for the alarm, arm heavy, elbow locked, fingers thick with dried blood and swelling. The slap is weak, dismissive, barely enough to silence the noise. The buzzing dies with a click. Deep breaths and beating fill the room.



Two sets.



Mine thin and ragged. 

The other slower, deeper, patient. Living in the same chest, curled around the same heart, beating just slightly ahead, just slightly behind, as though teaching me the rhythm I forgot I was supposed to follow.



I sit there. The sheet is glued to me. Stiff, crusty, reeking of iron and wet fur. My left knee is a swollen knot of meat and bone that doesn’t bend right; when I try to shift weight, it gives a wet pop and sends fresh heat blooming up the thigh. Ribs grind like gravel every time I inhale. Something in my cheekbone throbs in time with my pulse, airbag kiss turned purple-black crater. Blood has crusted in long ribbons down my chest, flaking off like old scabs when I move. The mirror across the room shows a stranger wearing my face: one eye swollen shut, lips split, hair matted with sweat and dirt and something darker.



Pain.

I was holding two garbage bags with my clothes inside because I didn't even own a suitcase. He kept talking, saying I was nothing without him, that I'd be crawling back within a month, that my ""little business ideas"" were embarrassing and everyone laughed about them behind my back.

I squeezed past him. My shoulder hit his chest and he actually laughed. Not a nervous laugh. A genuinely amused one.

That was thirteen months ago.

I moved into my friend's spare room and slept on an air mattress for three months while I built my marketing consulting company. My ex had always told me I wasn't smart enough to run a business, that my degree was useless, that clients would see right through me. He said this while he worked part-time at his dad's car dealership and played video games six hours a day.

I worked seventies-hour weeks. I landed my first major client in month two. By month six I had twelve clients and hired two employees. By month nine I moved into my own apartment, a real one with actual furniture I bought myself.

Month eleven, I signed a deal with a local business coalition. Part of the package was billboard advertising featuring member companies and their founders.

Last week my face went up on a billboard on the highway. Professional photo, company name, tagline about ""building your vision."" It's massive. You can see it from half a mile away.

Three days ago my phone buzzed with a text from my ex's number. I hadn't blocked him because honestly I'd forgotten he existed.

The text said: ""Saw your billboard. Looks amazing. I always believed in you. So proud of what you've accomplished. We should grab coffee and catch up.""

I stared at it for maybe ten seconds. Then I forwarded it to my lawyer.

See, when I left, my ex had kept my security deposit from our joint apartment, about $1,800. He claimed I'd damaged the walls by removing my decorations. He also kept a laptop I'd bought that he said was ""communal property"" even though I had the receipt. I'd been too exhausted and broke to fight it at the time.

But three months ago when I had money for a retainer, I'd had my lawyer send him a demand letter. He ignored it. We filed in small claims court. He ignored that too. We won a default judgment two weeks ago for the deposit, the laptop value, court fees, and interest. Total about $3,200.

My lawyer has been trying to serve him with the judgment to start collection. He'd been dodging the process server.

But now we had proof of his current phone number and active contact.

My lawyer texted back from my phone: ""This is Attorney \[Last Name\] representing \[my name\]. Your text confirms this number is operational. You have an outstanding judgment against you for $3,200. Payment arrangements can be discussed through this office. Do not contact my client directly again.""

Then she forwarded the screenshots to the process server who apparently showed up at the car dealership the next morning.

My ex called me seventeen times in two hours. I didn't answer. He left voicemails screaming that I was a ""vindictive bitch,"" that he was ""just being nice,"" that I'd humiliated him at his work, that his dad was furious, that I'd ""changed"" and become cold.

He sent texts saying he didn't have $3,200, that this would ruin him, that I was being cruel over nothing.

My lawyer sent a cease and desist.

Yesterday my mom called. She'd heard about the billboard from her friend and thought it was wonderful. Then she asked if I'd really ""sicced a lawyer"" on my ex over a friendly text.

Apparently his mom called my mom. His whole family is telling people I'm bankrupting him out of spite, that he was trying to be supportive and I went nuclear, that the billboard went to my head.

My mom said she understood why I was hurt but asked if I really needed to involve lawyers. She said it made me look bitter and like I couldn't move on. She suggested I could have just ignored his text or told him I wasn't interested in reconnecting.

My friend, the one who let me stay with her, said my ex deserved everything he got and then some. But my mom's words are stuck in my head.

He physically tried to stop me from leaving. He told me I'd fail. He stole my money and my property. But he did text something seemingly nice, even if the timing was obviously because he saw I was successful now.

Am I wrong for having my lawyer respond instead of just blocking him?

Ich weiß dass ich dann eine derbe Spirituosen- Fahne verbreite. Aber es ist mir egal.

Ich nehme dazu Alprazolam neu gegen Ängste seit wenigen Wochen, bei Bedarf,  weil sonst nichts wirkt. Es wirkt aber paradox und machte mich redselig, agil, fit, wach und ich schaffe ganz viel. Mutig und weniger ängstlich. Aber es verhindert trotzdem keine starke Angst in verordnet dosis. Es wirkt 6h ca. Und ist es abends abgeklungen, brauche ich unterwegs Eindämmung. Daher nehme ich dann ein Kisker Fläschchen.

Meine Beichte. Ich habe Depressionen, aber mehr soziale Ängste.

P .S nein ich bin keine Alkoholikerin. Ich entscheide mich bewusst dazu. Und kann es auch bewusst wieder absetzen und mich dann meinem Umfeld entsprechend anpassen. Ich mache es nur Just for fun, so wie man meinetwegen Mal ein Croissant isst statt ein Brötchen. Es ist meine Party ohne Freunde. 

Es ist eher ein Rückfall in alte Pfade. Ich lebe für heute und wenn nicht lang, dann wenigstens mit ruhigem Kopf. Und wenn dich lang, dann hoffe ich bis dahin gesundheitlich geheilt zu sein, ohne auf etwas zurückgreifen zu müssen .",0,1770760837.0,depression_de,1,0.5,False

Nope - an ink pen with the company logo on it and a junk coin with ""1 yr"" imprinted on it.

There's something about your workplace giving you a pen and calling it a gift that makes it insulting. Genuinely, if they had sent me nothing at all, I would have been perfectly happy and content. I would have \*preferred\* to receive nothing. ",7,1770760832.0,PetPeeves,3,1.0,False

I' M from Tangier.love chilling at cafes, walking by the corniche or beach at sunset, good food, movies, and just relaxed vibes.

Valentine's is coming up this Saturday , and I'm looking for a girl around my age  who's down for something casual and fun. Nothing serious or heavy – just meet up for coffee/tea in the medina or a nice spot, maybe grab dinner or dessert if it flows, walk around and chat.

If you're single, free that day, and wanna spend Valentine's with good company instead of solo, hit me up! We can chat here first to see if vibes match, exchange pics, etc. No pressure at all 😊

Prefer local in Tangier, but Tetouan or nearby could work too if you're up for it.

DM me if interested – tell me a bit about you!

I like to read, write, cook, paint, watch movies and hang out with friends. I am not looking for NSFW, I just get bored sometimes and when the people in my life are too busy I sometimes go on here to meet cool people. 

I have spent my whole life in Texas, but my parents are from Chicago. I actually am not a huge fan of traveling, this tends to shock people but I am pretty content to be in one spot.

Also I want to stress that Im not loiking for a relationship either. Just friends. I have dark hair and pale skin and dont exclusively dress in black but, especially in the winter, my wardrobe is normally darker colors. people assume Im alt/goth but I actually am not.

Im interested in you, tell me a bit about yourself and what about my post resonated with you. big bonus if you are a writer, its a hobby of mine and Im always looking to get better.

To wrap it up, Im pretty laid back and easygoing, Im pretty forgiving so dont feel intimidated messaging me, if something makes me feel uncomfortable Ill let you know and then we move on. im an open book and love when people ask me questions, so if you have any going into this, ask.",2,1770760766.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Any charitable souls interested in helping out? I can provide more details over PM. Reason n.1 I am not going to a tailor is because the pieces of clothing cost at max £6 and the hemming costs £8-15.

1r1eez5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r1eez5/tales_of_preacher_man_the_witch_haven_shifter/,Tales of Preacher Man - The Witch Haven Shifter,"The man's name was Mathias Green. 

I’d seen him in town a couple times, masquerading ‘round like a functioning human being - but I could tell the minute I set eyes on him that he was a broken man. 

At the time, I hadn’t paid him any mind - but when he stepped into the local diner and began screamin’ and cryin’ about a ghost, he became my problem.  
  
He was ranting and raving ‘bout the ghost of his dead wife who stole his children. I got up from my plate of chicken-steak and walked over to him, my wide gate causing a few bystanders to step aside. He was crying to a very confused biker while clinging to his leather jacket. I had to peel him off the poor man. He flailed and wailed while I carried him out the door,  but his intoxication and wiry frame kept him from being able to stop me.



Once we were standing in the cold night, feeling the drizzle of rain down our backs, he finally stopped shoutin’. I’d never seen him do this at the diner before, but I could tell that this wasn’t his first time dealing with the consequences of a meltdown. He stared at the ground for a minute, clearly waiting for me to walk back into the diner or scold him. When I didn’t do either, he looked up at me. 

The neon glow from the diners sign lit up half his face in a purple-blue glow. The rain made his face wet,  and the tears dripping from his eyes didn’t help.

His attitude went from a crazed panic to a man at the end of his rope. 

“Do you have any idea what it’s like to lose your child? And not just one of them — *all* of them? Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your wife after dealing with the grief of her death for years? I’m in hell and there’s nothing I can do about it. Nobody believes me.” His eyes were pleading but he already knew that I was just gonna dismiss him. What he didn’t know was that I wasn't no ordinary listener. 



I put my hand on his shoulder and studied him for a moment.“I believe you.”

The man didn’t know how to react. He stared at me for a moment, probably trying to figure out if I was yanking his chain or being honest. “I believe you, *and* I understand that pain.”

Tears filled his eyes as he struggled to keep it together. “God bless your soul” he muttered before breaking out into sobs. Before he could even pull himself together, he began trying to tell me what had happened.”I saw my wife through my bathroom mirror about a month ago. My kids went missing right after that. I could hear their shouts coming from that attic — but I haven’t been able to find them. My wife died a few years ago and I- I don't know what to do. I've called the cops so many times that they're convinced I'm just harassing them-”



I cut into the man's ramble, “Did you get any proof?”

People often ask for evidence, but they do it in such an accusing way that lets you know that they wouldn't believe you even if you had video footage of the thing - but he knew I was being sincere.



He took a second to respond, but when he did, he stumbled over his words. 

“I- maybe? I took photos. She doesn't appear in them, but there are these weird smudges-”

The mention of smudges surprised me a little bit. He continued to mutter but I cut him off again.



“You said smudges? Lemme see the pictures.”

He hesitated, processing what I just said before scrambling to pull the phone out of his pocket, nearly dropping it on the wet pavement.  “Whoa calm down bud - you'll lose the evidence!”

I took the phone from his shaky hands before he could fumble it again. 

He stared at me while I examined the photos, nervous anticipation carved into his tired face as his tears were finally outpaced by the rain.



“It appeared as your wife?”

He nodded feverishly, a glimmer of hope now shining in his eyes. I had to help this man.

“Well I guess my little vacation has gone on long enough. The name’s Alexander.” 

He shook my hand vigorously as he began to stutter. 

“I'm Mathias- wait does this mean you’ll help me?” Mathias looked like he was staring into the light at the end of a tunnel. I looked down and typed my number into his phone. 

“I need the address of where the ghost is at and a map of the house.” 

Mathias looked like he was about to explode with a mixture of emotions.

“I understand your dilemma, and I wanna help. You came to the right man, Mathias.”

  


I stood at the front door of an old two story home built at the end of a long gravel road in a small town called “Witch Haven”. Hunting an accursed demon in a town with a name like that felt more than a little ironic. I used Mathias’ key to unlock the heavy wooden door and stepped in.



The first room was the living room. There was a pretty big tv hanging on the wall, and a green couch that looked old and worn, but still comfy. A staircase on my left led to the second story. Rustic decorations were put all around the house, and paintings of farmlands hung on the walls. 

Next to the door was a pile of kids shoes. Pink rainboots, sneakers with dinosaurs on’em, bright blue mini-crocs. Dust covered all of the flat surfaces. It looked like Mathias hadn’t used this room since his kids went missing.



Mathias said that his kids' voices were comin’ from the attic - but it was important that I got a feel for the layout of the house first. It would be a bad idea to explore his house once I was on *the other side*.



I noticed some framed pictures of the man's family. There were two girls, a boy, Mathias, and his wife. They looked happy. I missed times like that. I’m sure Mathias and his kids did too.



I walked into the next room. This was the kitchen, but it had been transformed into a pigsty. A dining table sat in the middle of the room and it was completely littered with books, paper, flashlights, and food. There was a laptop opened up to some internet page talkin’ about ghosts, and all of the books had something to do with the paranormal. The counters were littered with half-eaten frozen dinners or other quick meals. Mathias had obviously been trying real hard to find his kids. I thanked God for sending the man in my direction.



There was a screened porch out back and a bathroom connected to the living room. Both had potted plants all over the place. The kitchen was the only place that had hardwood floors instead of carpet. It wasn’t my first time seeing a carpeted bathroom, but I always thought it was so strange.



Each step of the stairs had a unique squeak that was muffled by the thick carpet that laid over them. When I got to the top hallway, I noticed the entrance to the attic. It was a pull-down hatch in the ceiling. An eerie green glow was emanating from the cracks around the hatch. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if something is part of the spirit world or not. I’ve been blessed with eyes to see, but some things can be seen by anybody. That being said, Mathias probably would have told me about the light if he had been able to see it.  
  
There were three bedrooms upstairs. Matthias’ was a mess. The man desperately needed to do his laundry. The other rooms were undoubtedly his kids. One was the room of his son. Spaceships were painted onto the walls and there were glow stars on the ceiling. The room was clean and everything seemed to have a place.

The other room was shared by both of Mathias’ daughters. Everything was pretty and pink and girly. Art supplies and makeup were mixed together on a desk and there was an odd amount of lamps for two little girls. This place really felt like a home. 

“Don’t worry Mathias, I’m gonna fix this. No man should have to suffer that sorta pain.”



I stepped back into the hallway. “Time to get to business”. 

I pulled the string to the attic hatch. There was a film of green obscuring my sight. I had brought a backpack with some basic equipment - like a rope. I wasn’t sure what was going to be on the other side of this haze, so I tied one end of the rope to the stairs hand rail, and the other end around my waist. Satisfied with that amount of preparation, I climbed into the attic.



Now there are several different types of extradimensional spaces and each type gives a hint as to what kind of spirit you’re dealin’ with. At first when I climbed into this attic I wasn’t sure what I would find — but when gravity inverted and I fell onto the ceiling of the bathroom, I realized I was in somethin’ I call a “fun house”.



I laid on my back, groaning and looking up at the entrance to the attic. It was on the bathroom floor. I was positioned on the ceiling, popcorn drywall digging into my back and everything. Through the attic's opened hatch I could see the floor of the hallway. The rope was sticking straight up through the hatch and laying on the floor. Gravity was slowly pulling the rope back to the other side of the hatch. It gave it the illusion of flight - but that’s just because gravity was pulling it in two directions. I had been stupid and left too much slack in the rope for it to have cushioned my fall. If I ever dealt with another fun house, I wouldn’t make that mistake again. I untied the rope from myself and looped it around the seat of the now upside-down toilet.



I was now on *the other side*. Stinging green haze flooded my lungs, feeling like a million hungry mouths gnawing at my respiratory system. An odd blue light bounced off the walls, forming infernally-shaped shadows that teemed and writhed under my gaze. Both the haze and the light did not pass through the hatch back into the hallway. “No gettin’ back out now” I grunted while struggling to stand. 

“A man in his late 50s shouldn’t be falling onto ceilings from a distance like that.” 



This room was an exact copy of the bathroom downstairs — except for the fact that I was standing on the ceiling. The faucets were turned on, allowing water to pool into the sink and bath tub. It should have come streaming down on my head - but it didn’t. The same for the toilet water. I muttered a thanks to the Lord - “I don’t want no toilet water soakin’ into this jacket”  
I also noticed that the door was on the ceiling, meaning I wouldn’t have to climb up and over it. That was another thank God.



I noticed that I was missing from the mirror's reflection. If Mathias was in his bathroom at the right time, he would have been able to see his kids being ferried away by some sort of infernal hellspawn into this unholy place. I stepped forward and opened the door.



The living room sat before me, covered in the same noxious haze and swirling shadows. Unlike the bathroom, it was right-side-up. The furniture was in its place and it looked like it had been cleaned. There was only one teeny tiny problem — the floor was replaced by an endless void. On a second glance, there was also no staircase or windows. Only the door to the kitchen on the other side of the room.



I let out an exaggerated sigh. I was starting to get annoyed. It felt like this thing was targeting my achin’ bones and sore back. Good thing I was still pretty fit - but I was *not* gonna enjoy this.  
I leaned out of the doorway and clambered my way onto the entertainment cabinet that was placed under the tv. 



Just as I got my footing, the tv clicked on, blaring white noise at full volume into my left ear. I staggered and slapped my hand over my ear to block out the sound. Right as I caught my balance, a hand shot out of the screen, flailing as if it had no bones. It spun in a circle, moving fast enough to create a swishing sound. Quickly as I could - I pulled a container of iodised salt and doused the arm in it. Salt is only really good at anti-magic, but it’ll cause anything that's spiritual in nature to hesitate. The arm slowed, giving me enough time to slash at the thing with a silver-tipped sica. The arm deflated into a sac of wrinkled skin, flinging salt into my eyes before evaporating back into the tv screen. Cursing, I blinked the salt out of my eyes and ripped the tv off the wall, chucking it headlong into the void. The sound of white noise reverberated around for half a minute as it fell. “I really hate fun houses”.



I looked at my next challenge; getting into the kitchen. The furniture was floating, but the cabinet I stood on had enough mass to barely move under my weight. I couldn’t decide if that was a good or a bad thing - but it definitely made balance easier. My best course of action would be to jump onto the couch and hope that the force would push it into the wall. From there I could pull it towards the kitchen. “Yeah, that ought’a do it”.



Before I could overthink it - I leapt onto the couch. The overstuffed cushions collapsed under my feet, causing me to fall across the couch as if I was about to take a nap. 

“Dang this thing is heavy” the couch hadn’t even budged under the impact of my weight. I laid my head down on the armrest for just a moment. It was comfortable and I was tempted to stay there for a moment to catch my breath - but then I realized, 

“This thing’s try’na eat me!”



This wasn’t anything new. I’ve been trapped in a couch like this before - and worse. If I had to describe what being eaten by a couch is like; imagine crowd surfing on a crowd that wants nothing more than to suffocate you. It’s already an unpleasant experience, but unlike those other experiences, I’d never had a couch also rob me blind! 



The fabric had turned to an ooze and was permeating the bag. It had unzipped every single pocket and was already pulling items out! I didn’t have enough time to grab my hatchet before it was sucked into oblivion. I ripped my arms free from the negative space of the couch, and wrestled with the cushions to get my pack away from it. I was successful, but lost a pack of silver buckshot along with the hatchet. I winced at the price of the lost ammo. If I was lucky, it’d appear in the cushions of Mathias' couch in the real world - but that was extremely unlikely.



I struggled against the couch for a minute before I managed to pry my way over the back and hoist myself onto the welcome mat. It held my weight but shifted around like it was a flying carpet. I’ve used this trick before. Using the wall and my calloused hands, I awkwardly pulled myself and the “magic mat” to the kitchen door. I felt like some kinda handicapped aladdin.



I finally reached the entrance, but before I stepped in, I took a deep breath. Wrestling with that couch wore me plumb out. I cracked my back, stretched my arms, and stepped across the threshold into the kitchen. It looked normal - which was instantly a sign of caution. There was an unseen danger in here. I picked up and tossed the mat into the middle of the room. Nothing. Well as long as the floor was real and nothing instantly murderized the mat, I’m safe to go further in.



Decades ago, my first time in a fun house, I was slow and methodical in the rooms where there seemingly wasn’t an issue. I learned very quickly that this approach was a bad idea. It was better to rule out instant death, if possible, and then barrel through the room so that anything painful didn’t have time to catch you.



I took a breath, and then launched into a sprint towards the back door. As soon as I took a step, all of the papers on the table zipped into the air and pointed themselves towards me. 

As I dropped for cover beneath the table, I could see them folding themselves into paper airplanes - and a millisecond later, they all collided with the wall so hard that they pierced themselves into it like arrows. In response, the wall quivered. Then it cried. Then it bled.

Blood started pouring into the room so fast that by the time I was able to stand up, the room was filled to my ankles. I waded as quickly as I could to the back door, splashing blood up on the counters and soaking it into most of my clothes. By the time I reached for the doorknob the blood was up to my waist. 



I flung the door open, only to find yet another endless void in front of me. “Ah shi-”

The blood turned to a riptide, threatening to pull me down to the depths of hades while pulling me beneath the surface. I grabbed on to the doorframe, squeezed my eyes shut, and held on for dear life. Every heavy thought that I could muster went straight up to the Lord.

 “Heavenly Father, give me strength. Don’t let me fall into the hands of the evil one. Deliver me from the plans of this hellspawn.” 

My prayers worked. My arms felt stronger - just enough to keep me from spiraling into the void until the rush of blood went from a roar to a trickle. I sat in a puddle of life force, breathing heavily and trying to dry the liquid from my eyes. Being covered head to toe in blood wasn’t necessarily a common experience when being a demon hunter — but it certainly wasn’t rare.

One time I nearly lost my life when most of my shotgun shells had been contaminated, but God came to the savin’ just in time. After that experience, I wax coated my shells so they couldn’t fail again. I waterproofed most items I could, but shells were especially a priority.



After a couple minutes, I stood up and peered downwards. Through this doorway was something that looked like an endless elevator shaft. I couldn’t tell if the walls were made out of a slime so thin that it looked like light, or light so thick that it looked like slime. A current of air was blasting upwards, sending flakes of dust and color into the infinite. That air flow hadn’t been there when the blood was flowin’. It looked like the back porch stretched upwards and downwards into infinity. I hadn’t seen anything like this before. I needed guidance. 

I closed my eyes and sent up a quick prayer. 

“Father God, is this the path towards the kids that I have been sent here to save?” 

For about a minute there was only silence. Then I felt a small warmth in my heart, almost imperceptible, but it was all too familiar. I didn’t hesitate. I tipped forward and fell into the shaft. Once I had entered, the wind began rushing so quickly that it lifted me upwards.



There were windows scattered across the wall at random intervals during my ascent. Through the windows there was nothing but a black expanse. The outside was always interesting when inside of an interdimensional space. I’m not sure what would happen if you were to walk out of the house. Every time I was about to, I got a horrible feeling from the Holy Spirit telling me to stop. I expect I would be lost in oblivion or something similar if I ever walked through those doors. 



As I flew upwards, the walls slowly began to grow dim. I reached around into my pack and grabbed a flashlight. By the time it was in my hands, I was soaring through a black darker than the night before creation. I clicked it on- but no luck. Stupid demon drained my batteries. There was a pressure that started to be exerted on my legs, but at the time it had come on so slowly that I didn’t notice it. I reached back into my pack and pulled out two double A batteries. Have you ever tried to load batteries into a flashlight while reverse skydiving? Trust me, it is not an experience that you want. By the time I got the batteries loaded, the pressure in my legs had built enough that it felt like I was standing. When I finally clicked on the flashlight, I was able to see that I *was*, in fact, standing. 



The wind blew strong as ever but I was no longer moved by it. I stood alone in a hallway that seemed to have no beginning or end. I was caught off guard as I took in my surroundings. The carpet here was *different*. It wasn’t anything like Mathias had in his house. Likewise, the walls were covered in a floral wallpaper. Mathias had no wallpaper in his house, only paint. Something about this hallway ate at my insides. It felt familiar. The scent of an old house mixed with floral perfume drifted on the wind, prompting me to realize that the usual acidic haze was gone. That perfume was uncannily familiar but it felt like something was blocking my memory. Either way, it made me feel comfortable.



This place felt safe.

The Lord told me otherwise.



A cold, quivering hand latched onto my shoulder with such force that it’d put a new pair of vice grips to shame. I spun around pulling my shotgun off my hip and getting ready to fire at center mass — “Mathias!? What in God’s green earth are you doin’ here? How did you- why did you-”



Mathias let out a yelp of relief before words began to tumble out of him with such a speed that it’d make an auctioneer jealous.

“Oh thank GOD I thought I was stuck down here forever you have no idea how terrifying it is to be stuck in this hellhole with no light I kept hitting my head on the walls and my eyes are dry from all the wind and no matter how far I walk I never reach the end of the hallwa-”



“CLAMP IT” Mathias took a step back as I shouted over his slapdash poetry. 

“Mathias, this is no place for a man with no experience to be. You could die!”

He looked at me with so much fear in his eyes that you’d think he had seen a demon. 

To be fair — I guess being in a forsaken place such as this is just as bad as seein’ a demon.

He opened his mouth and did his best to talk in a manner that I could understand.

“L-last night. They were crying again. I couldn’t — Alex, I-I couldn’t just sit there and listen.”



At first glance, his eyes were full of nothing but fear. After a moment though, I could see his soul was burning with anger. Anger at the spirit for taking his kids and for corrupting the image of his dead wife. Mathias came off as a coward when I first met him. He seemed like the type to let anybody walk all over him. He seemed afraid of making people upset. But if this idiot had enough gumption to walk into the territory of a demon completely alone to save his kids - maybe my read on him was wrong. Even if he was an idiot for doing so.

I looked down at his hands. He was holding an axe.



“Mathias, bud. You’re an idiot. But I respect it. We’re gonna gechu your kids.”

His shoulders relaxed a bit, but only for a moment. 

“Not if we stay stuck in this hellhole of a hallway we’re not! There’s no end, we’re going to die in here Alex! My kids are going to die in here Alex!” No matter how long we walk there’s never going to be an end - it just loops!”

I cut into his ramble by snatching the axe from his hands, and hoisting it over my right shoulder.

“Thank God you brought an axe, bud. Last time I was stuck in one of these hallways I broke three toes!”



He was about to start back up again before I swung at the wall, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground out of surprise. “What are you doing!?”

I took another swing, sending a cloud of drywall dust into the air and mangling the poor, pretty wallpaper. “What’s it look like?”

I aimed another strike. A hole in the drywall had crumbled away, allowing me to see the beams of the house. It only took a few hits before the two-by-fours were chopped up and outta there.



I set the axe-head on the floor and leaned on the handle, admiring my work.

“Mathias. You see how I had to cut through two beams just so we could fit through this wall? This house was built unusually sturdy.”

He looked confused and still surprised as he stood.

“So that’s our way out?” He pointed to the hole. There was another layer of drywall on the other side of the beams - but there was no sense using an axe on that. 

“Yes sir, that’s our exit!” I braced, and kicked the rest of my way through the drywall.



As Mathias and I stepped through the wall, I inhaled out of shock. Unfortunately, this caused me to inhale some drywall dust and I started hacking and coughing like a mad man. Mathias patted me on the back as I cleared my lungs — and then he realized the same thing that I had.

“This room isn’t part of my house.”

I had told Mathias that this demon would likely have created a twisted version of his house. It would look different, but familiar. Like the hallway we had just come from, this room wasn’t even remotely like anything within Mathias’ house. I didn’t know what was happening, and that worried me for Mathias’ sake. “Stay close to me bud. I’m not exactly sure what’s going on.”

Something about this house was familiar, but distant. The perfume smell was even stronger and I knew I definitely had a memory related to it - but my brain just could not make the connection. It felt like I had blocked it out of my mind - which wasn’t a good sign. I wasn’t sure why I would have suppressed a memory.



The room had the same floral wall paper as the hallway. The walls had a plethora of shelves on them, each filled with either books or lamps. There were a couple of old rocking chairs and a big couch arranged along two of the walls. A coffee table sat in the middle of all of them, its surface cluttered with drink coasters and informative magazines about all sorts of topics. The room had an archway that led into another room that looked like a kitchen. On the far wall, there was a large, open sliding door and - for the first time ever in one of these pocket dimensions - I could see outside. There was a fenced area with trees and a pretty garden. Sunlight filtered through the leaves and bled into the room around us. A gentle breeze flowed through the door, carrying the scent of flowers and fresh air. I closed my eyes for a moment. Only for a moment.



“Take this back” I handed the axe back to Mathias and began to walk to the archway into the kitchen. “I’m not sure that we’re in a demon dimension anymore.”

Mathias relaxed and looked like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders, but his relief quickie turned to confusion. “How? Where are we now?”

I didn’t know how to answer his question so I just grunted. He waited for an actual response as I turned to look around the kitchen. The floor looked like a checker board. The counters had appliances on them that look like they had been recently used. The oven was on and smelled faintly like pie. A small circle table sat in the middle of the room with an even smaller chandelier placed above it. There were only two chairs. Vases with flowers were placed throughout the entire room, and warm sunlight flooded through 6 bright windows. There was an old rotary phone hung on the wall to our left. I remembered that phone.



“This is my old house?” I asked as an answer to the question that still hung in the air. As soon as I said it, I realized that I was correct. This was my home. The last place I remember actually feeling like a home. The last place I was happy. The last place I ever saw my wife. I wonder if she’s here? That thought made my heart jump but I pushed it down. 

No, she’s not. She couldn’t be.



Just as that thought hit me - I heard her call out to me. “Preacher man!”

Before I could even think, we both began to run back into the living room to a door we hadn’t noticed before. I flung it open and we both bolted up the creaky old stairs. After years of wondering what happened to her, years of hunting these unholy hellspawn to get her back, I was finally about to rescue her. I didn’t know how or why, but something told me that she was here.



As we climbed, the stairs turned to stone, the stone became covered in moss, and the moss squirmed beneath our weight. We reached the top and found ourselves in the upstairs hallway of Mathias’ house, this time made of stone. The sunlight was replaced with blue light and the acid haze was back. 



Once we reached the top of the stairs, Mathias didn’t stop. “It’s okay sweetheart! Daddy's here!”

He sprinted full speed into the doorway of both his daughters room. I didn’t have time to stop him. As soon as he entered, physics seemed to stop around him and he became frozen as a statue floating in space.



“Damn!” I yanked the rope to the attic, sending the ladder slamming down at my feet. 

“Damn!” I hiked up my blood-soaked jeans and began to climb.

“Dammit Mathias! I hope you can hold your breath!” The voice was a lie.



I clambered into the ceiling joists of Mathias’ house. There was no acid haze, and the only thing illuminating this attic was my flashlight. Mathias’ children floated near the rafters in the center of the room, all tangled together into an unnatural ball of joints and skin. They were unconscious. Without hesitation, I began balancing across the joists towards them, but before I could reach them, their bloody eyes shot open. Tears streamed down their faces as they screamed so loud that my ears began to ring. The house shook. My brain felt like it was going to explode. I covered my ears and ducked down, waiting for the sound to stop. It didn’t. The joists around me began to twist, nails popping out of the brittle wood. “I’m here to help you!” I called out, but they couldn’t hear me. The joists bent further, flexing and cracking up around me. I felt my composure begin to fall apart. The joists almost had me completely surrounded. Is this what it feels like to be a fly stuck in a venus flytrap?  My mind was unraveling, reeling into nothing more than a string. My brain was going to melt if I didn’t move — and I *couldn’t* move.I was going to die from Mathias’ own kids.



*Her* voice cut through the noise like a silver blade through the heart of a sand devil. 

“Preacher man.”



All sound was gone. I opened my eyes and looked up. The mangled grasp of the contorted house turned to dust and drifted away into the darkness. I could see her angelic figure hovering there, wrapped in a green glow that casted dancing shadows into the distance. She was more beautiful than even the northern lights could aspire to be. My wife.



I stepped towards her, tears filling my eyes. I must be dead. We both must be. I’ve waited so long - searched for so long, and finally I found her. You know how they always say that you never truly get over the loss of someone? They’re right. It had been so long that I did feel okay - but one look at her and all the pain that I thought I had sorted through just lifted off my soul. I felt light. I felt happy. I sent a prayer of thanks up to the Lord.

“Father, you have no idea how much this means to me. Thank you for bringing her back-” Something’s wrong. This isn’t right. Her smile is too wide, her fingers are too long. I don't want to believe it. My soul jerks, God desperately fighting for me to listen.

The relief sours. The weight returns stronger than it was before. The grief comes crashing back into my soul like the waves that carried away Noah’s ark. And along with all of that, rage.

I took a long look at the image of my wife. “Some day we’ll be reunited. Just not today.”



She called out to me again, her voice sounding like a song that only the angels could have created. “Preacher man, I’ve waited so long for you”

I raised my shotgun. Her expression falters — and for a split second I can see that god forsaken devil behind a mask of my wifes face.

“Get her voice out of your damn mouth.” I unloaded six shells into that satan. 



It flew back with each shot, hitting the floor with a wet slap and sliding across a piece of splintered plywood in the center of the room. It writhed and convulsed, clearly in great pain. Angelic lights turned to dark tendrils. Its skin turned red and became covered in blisters. Six ram horns were twisted around the top of its head. Its face constantly shifted between a mass of eyes and the familiar faces of people I knew. 



I began walking towards it. “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on scorpions.”

It screamed inside of my mind with the cries of a thousand dying children as its face flicked between my mother, father, brother, and my children in a desperate attempt to make me reconsider.



I was only a few feet away from the thing now. “And over all the power of the enemy.”

It stopped changing into the faces of people who I cared for, and began to speak to me with its own demonic voice. “You dare tread upon an upper servant of the ruler of darkness?” It hissed in a draconic tongue.



I was standing right next to it. “And nothing shall by any means hurt you.” I quoted. It jeered at me from the floor as I lifted my boot to aim the final blow. “You think that your scripture scares me, preacher? I am a being that has been gifted immeasurable power from Satan himself! I have been here since the dawn of time. I have seen humanity rise and fall. I will be here until the ends of the earth! No mortal can-”



“Oh go to hell, serpent.” I pistoned my heel down, crushing its skull, splattering hundreds of eyes and sloughs of brain tissue onto the wooden joists nearby. The house was still.



Luckily for Mathias, he was surprisingly good at holding his breath. He made it out fine. His children had gone through a lesser version of hell and had some serious trauma to overcome unfortunately. They had also been mangled but nothing beyond fixing. After a few doctors visits, their physical ailments were cured. 



It’s been years since this incident and I’m happy to report that I’m still in touch with Mathias. His kids are all grown up and his son even has kids of his own now. Their house was able to return to being a home.



I was afflicted by the appearance of my wife in that fun house — but it seemed to relight the hatred of demons in my soul. Soon after, I set back out on the road in search of my wife. I had kept at it for decades now, and I wouldn’t quit until the good Lord called me up to sing in that heavenly choir.",1,1770760323.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False
1r1eego,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1r1eego/looking_for_feedback_on_our_paris_itinerary_3/,Looking for feedback on our Paris itinerary - 3 nights for a family of 5,"Bonjour!

My family will be in Paris for 3 nights coming up near the end of March and I was looking for some feedback on our planned itinerary.  We’re a family of 5, oldest kid is 10 and my twins will be turning 7 while we are in Paris.  We’re flying in from Canada (Vancouver) to London so will have already adjusted to the time difference by the time we get to Paris.

&nbsp;

I know it’s a bit of a “checklist” of things to see but it’s a short visit with kids and our first time in Paris.  We aren’t into shopping and have no plans for fine dining (I don’t want to plan our meals/reserve restaurants in advance so we will be looking for quick service/casual food options when the kids get hungry.)


I’m hoping to balance fun stuff for the kids with sightseeing the adults want to do (they get a day at Disneyland, we get a day dragging them around the city).  The kids love interactive exhibits and playgrounds, so we are open to suggestions for indoor attractions and play spaces where the kids can run around (we're coming from Vancouver so completely expecting it to rain the whole time we're there).

&nbsp;

We’ll be using transit frequently to help reduce cries of “my legs are tired” from the kids.  I’ve already looked into the transit passes so I think I have a good idea of what we’ll need.  Our luggage will be one carry-on size roller suitcase plus a backpack each so I hope that will be manageable between the train stations and our hotel.  As a family of 5 I don’t know if taxis or ubers are even an option.

&nbsp;

*Our plan so far:*

**Sunday March 22:**

* Arrive at 2pm via Eurostar from London
Take Metro from Gare du Nord to our hotel in the 15th (closest station is Bir-Hakeim), Google says 30min but I’m budgeting an hour  (should arrive around check-in) 
* After settling in, walk down towards the Eiffel Tower, “oooh ahhh” a bit and take some pictures
* Maybe explore Jardins du Trocadéro (maybe visit the aquarium if enough time)
* Possibly take a Seine river cruise (Bateaux Parisiens has trips starting near the Eiffel Tower)
* Look for something to eat in the area when the kids decide they are hungry. 

&nbsp;

**Monday: General sightseeing**

I’m hoping that we can just go from site to site without having to pre-book any tickets in case we need to drop something or change the order.  
If the weather is nice we’ll be looking for parks/playgrounds along the way to let the kids play while my husband and I look for coffee/snacks.  My oldest plans to look for space invaders. 

I’ve listed the stops in a loop that would minimize the transit time/doubling back between locations but I’m flexible on the order (and willing to drop/add locations).

* Montparnasse Tower (optional, weather dependant) - We are not planning to go up the Eiffel Tower (one kid is too scared but an enclosed elevator and glassed-in observation deck will work for them)
* Notre Dame
* Louvre (explore the grounds only) and the Tuileries Garden (if weather is ok)
* Sacré-Cœur (optional)
* Arc de Triumph 

&nbsp;

**Tuesday: Disneyland Paris** 

My twins birthday.  Yes we miss the opening of the new World of Frozen by less than a week but maybe it will be slightly less busy?  

* Leave the hotel around 8-830am. Take metro line 6 to RER A (change at Charles de Gaulle-Etoile, apparently the walk to change lines is super long), budgeting 1hr 15min or longer to get to Disneyland (is there a better way to get to the RER A?)
* Spend as much time as the kids feel like in the parks, dinner probably in Disney Village
* Return to the hotel (about 1-1.5 hrs travel time) and crash for the night

&nbsp;

**Wednesday:**

* Pack up and check out (have breakfast at hotel or nearby before checking out)
* Take transit to Gare de l'Est and store luggage
* Visit Musée d'Orsay (buy tickets for 11am?) - My husband requested this visit so he can check out the Van Gogh works they have on display.
* Plan to be back at the train station by 3pm (train leaves just before 4pm) so have time between the museum and leaving Paris to find some food to take with us (some sandwiches etc). We could buy food on the train but I’d rather have something I know the kids will eat just in case.

&nbsp;

I know we have some limitations on things we can do because of the days we’ll be in town (eg Musée d'Orsay is closed on Mondays) but if anyone has suggestions on the flow of our stops or things the kids might be interested in seeing please let me know.  I’ve tried to do a lot of research and read other itinerary posts to bring my expectations in line with reality but realize I may still be way off. 

&nbsp;

As a side note, my husband and I are planning to return to Paris in a couple years by ourselves (when we have extended childcare available) so we can save in depth neighbourhood exploration and museum visits for that trip.",1,1770760291.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,1.0,False

""Okay, children. Let's go inside before the rain begins."" Satia opened the door just as the rain began and ushered the children into the atrium; a massive rectangular space, with a towering ceiling located at the top of six floors of classrooms flanking it on all sides, and two curved staircases leading up to the highest floor.

The only sound inside the academy was the howling wind pushing through gaps in the doors and occasional thunder. Their footsteps echoed  as they crossed the hall and walked down the first corridor on the left. They passed a dozen wooden doors before Satia stopped in front of one of them, pushing it open.

""Hello, Hello!"" The mentor in the class stood up from his chair and opened his arms, as if he was really excited to see these little brats. He turned to Satia with a big smile which she returned with a half-smile and a slight nod, as if to say, ‘*now they are your problem*.’

Satia closed the door after the last student entered and breathed out in relief, having finished that chore. She walked toward her office at the end of that corridor and collapsed on her big, soft sofa. Her room was warm, cosy and filled with shelves of books. And most importantly, there were no kids.

She closed her eyes, and let her mind swim in a sea of thoughts, memories, and desires. Four more months and Raibod would be back in the city. He was the only one who could still make her laugh and bring a bit of colour to her grey world. His broad shoulders and the warmth of his body were the best pillow she could ever want. His support, even when he was mad and annoyed by her constant questions about the Orders and the gods, was the reason she was this bold.

Someone tapped on the door, and dragged Satia's mind back to her office. ""Come in."" She sat up straight and fixed her clothes and capelet.

A man wearing a one-shouldered brown cape over a white tunic entered. Both the cape and the tunic were adorned with beadwork that shimmered under the lights. ""Hi, Satia.""

A genuine smile appeared on Satia's face. The man who entered was one of the very few people she actually liked. He was not perfect, as no one was, but he had helped her many times even when he was just a mere Altar-minister, let alone after he became the principal of the most famous academy.

Maybe liking him for things he did for her was selfish, but it was what it was. ""Hey, Govad,"" Satia said.

The old man settled down on the other sofa. His small round belly and long grey beard, combined with his peaceful, confident voice, made him look like the kind, caring grandfather she never had. ""I heard about your little conflict with Izadyar.""

Satia made a deflating sound and rolled her eyes. ""Don't tell me she came to you.""

""Oh dear, but she did,"" Govad chuckled. ""While I admire your bravery, you should not expect a fair fight when jackals surround you.""

""Did she make a problem for me again?""

""Nothing that cannot be handled,"" Govad smiled.

Satia didn’t want to think about Izadyar or what she had said to the academy’s board. She redirected her thoughts to the stain on Govad's cape near the small, round, simple brooch. It was fresh and brownish; probably a drop of coffee from his long beard made it... Wait! His brooch was simple, with no hands.

""You aren't wearing your prayer brooch!"" Satia said.

Govad chuckled at the astonishment on her face. ""It's better than wearing it but not praying, like you."" he taunted.

Satia rolled her eyes. ""You're aMinister, not a simple mentor like me. Plus, last time I checked, not wearing a prayer brooch is an indirect way to say you're a heretic. Are you saying that?""

Govad waved his hand dismissively. ""Relax. No one cares if an old Civil-Minister wears his brooch or not."" He sank deeper into the sofa and clasped his hands together. ""Anyway, I came here to tell you something."" That was not good. When someone says they have something to tell you without just saying it, it means they have something you don't want to hear. ""The board needs you to prove your loyalty.""

""I bet they do."" Satia gave Govad a halfway smile.

""Satia, they chose you as one of the ten teachers for Judgment Day.""

""Oh, demon-dung!"" Satia didn't mean to swear in front of the principal. But it was too late. She saw the disappointment on Govad's face. ""Sorry. But do you know how boring and long that day is?""

""I'm sure that's not your real reason."" Govad’s blue eyes got even darker. Yes, that was not Satia’s only reason for disliking Judgment day. 

""Well, if you know the reason, then you know my answer too."" Satia lay back on her warm sofa and watched Govad gritting his teeth.

""Satia, you need to do this or I can't convince the board to keep you in here any longer."" Govad sighed.

Someone knocked on the door. Satia raised her eyebrows at Govad, who shrugged back. ""Come in!"" She shouted.

A guard entered. ""One of the parents wants to see you."" The guard had one hand on the door and the other on her sword as if Satia was about to attack her at any moment. 

""A parent wants to see me?!"" Satia said. The guard nodded. ""Whose parents are they?"" Satia asked.

""How should I know? Bringing messages is not exactly my job."" The guard was annoyed.

""Okay Almaz, get back to your post,"" Govad said, making the guard notice him in the room. She saluted. ""Sorry, sir. Didn't see you there,"" she said. Govad simply waved his hand dismissively again and turned his attention back to Satia. Sometimes Satia forgot how serious and cold Govad could act.

As the guard left the room, Govad began chanting the words of Rashnu; words that sounded like a stone falling into a deep well, echoing as they descended. His irises faded, the liquid in his tattoos glowed brighter, and he froze in place. All three of his vertical eye tattoos on his forehead gleamed faintly.

Satia sat there watching the frozen body of Govad for a few minutes until he blinked again and the warmth of life returned to his body. ""Ah... these stupid Karies’. After centuries of working withMinisters, they still haven't learned to follow orders properly."" Govad stood up from the sofa. ""Well, I only saw a black carriage in front of the gate. There was no heraldry on it either. You should go and have a chat with whoever that parent is. We don't want anyone unsatisfied with our academy, right?""

""Yeah, yeah. The whole world should be happy with us,"" Satia said, pushing herself to her feet.

""Satia,"" Govad said, standing in front of her and placing his heavy hand on her shoulder, ""for my sake, don't start a conversation with them about gods and orders and all that. Okay?""

Satia rolled her eyes. ""Okay, I won't.""

Govad glanced at Satia before leaving the room. ""And prepare yourself mentally for Judgment Day. You are going. It's an order.""

Another ""Okay"" left Satia's mouth as she followed Govad outside. They went in different directions;Govad to his office and Satia to the gates. The corridor and the main hall were no longer empty and quiet. Students of all ages filled the space with their chatter and laughter. She made her way through them, praying that whoever the parent was, they would talk quickly so she could return to her office and get the rest she had been longing for since morning.

The rain had ended, leaving puddles in the grass. However, the sky was still covered with dark clouds. Govad's Karies was walking on the walls with its wings tucked in, dragging its long, black tail behind it like a skirt. One of its heads turned to the guard near the gate, while the other turned to Satia. Its white eyes were fixed on her, watching every step she took. She wondered if Govad was checking on her right now or not.

There was a simple black carriage on the other side of the gate, just as Govad described. Its driver was half asleep when Satia reached the carriage and cleared her throat.

""Oh gods!"" The man jumped out of his state and quickly composed himself. He sat straight and, before Satia could ask anything, said, ""They're waiting for you inside the carriage, madam.""

Satia gave him a kind smile and turned away from him. She knocked on the carriage door and opened it. Two figures were sitting at the other end of the carriage, where the shadows were thicker and it was harder for Satila to see their faces.  She felt a sense of danger.

""Hello, Satia,"" a man with a raspy low voice said. ""Come in, we have a lot to talk about.""

""I was about to invite you into the academy. We can have tea while chatting."" Satia didn't want to get caught up in something amiss.

The other figure shifted in their seat and leaned out of the shadows. It was a woman with a thick black fringe on long hair, a warm smile, and a pair of dimples that looked more like deep lines. She didn't look dangerous. ""We are here because of your parents,"" she said casually as if  talking about the weather. But nothing about mentioning Satia’s parents was casual; they had been dead for a long time. Satia didn't reply. Instead, she climbed into the carriage and closed the door behind her. Curiosity won over fear.

The man squeezed himself more into the corner. He had a hood on and was dressed in black from head to toe. ""We know you have their notebook. And we know you are continuing their work,"" he said with a deep voice.

""What?"" Satia's heart sank. Was this a trap? Were they devotees? Were they here to arrest her? ""Who told you this nonsense?!""

""Don't be afraid,"" the woman said. ""We are here to help you."" She smiled. 

How old was this woman? Mid-twenty? No way. Maybe mid-thirty. Why was Satia even thinking about her age? She cleared her mind from any stupid thoughts. ""Help me? With what? I don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice was shaking slightly.

The man continued like she didn’t just deny everything, ""We will give you a Statebinder and a safe building to continue their projects,"" the man said. His voice was familiar, but fear had paralyzed Satia's brain. She couldn't remember who this voice belonged to.

""No, no, no."" Satia might have been studying her parents' theories and she might have been obsessed with them too. But this offer was too scary. She didn't want to end up like her parents. She reached for  the handle and opened the carriage door. But the woman grabbed her other arm before she could get out. ""Don't you want to know if it works?"" she asked.

Satia did want to know, but not at the risk of her life.

""It will be a breakthrough if it works. We can discover things no one has seen before. We might be able to challenge the gods. Or even free the Healers,"" the woman said.

*Freeing Healers*. Satia’s heart ached. The handle slipped through her hand. ""It might... but what if it confirms the gods' story?"" Satia murmured.

The man considered her answer as confession, ""No, it won't. The gods forbid this science because they're scared of its power in revealing the truth,"" he said.

""And even if it does confirm it, we still can free the Healers"" the woman leaned forward. ""Your parent’s project is the entrance to a new science. One that can turn any ordinary person into a god.""

Satia reached for the handle again and pushed the door open. ""I... I need to go.""

The woman placed a letter on her lap. ""We'll wait for you.""



Satia looked at them both one last time, grabbed the letter, and jumped out of the carriage.

*Pit’s fire!*

1r1eces,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rToronto_Clean/comments/1r1eces/23f4m_lowpressure_meetups_into_something_more/,23F4M low-pressure meetups into something more? Please Read to know what I'm hoping for,"Hello gentlemen—this is a longer post, but details matter, especially when dating with intention. I’m open to meeting and seeing where things go naturally, but I’m not here for rushed or purely physical connections.

I’m looking for low-pressure meet ups to start NOT LOOKING TO DATE RIGHT AWAY but I am slowly trying to put myself back out there.

I'd be into coffee, walks, bookstores, dinner, cozy conversations—just getting to know each other and seeing if we naturally vibe. Even if you don't want to date we can be friends if something resonates. 

A little about me:

I’m 5’3, very curvy, creative, and a romantic at heart. I’ve lost about 65 lbs over the past year and I’m continuing to take care of myself mentally and physically—this matters to me, and I value someone who does the same. INFP and Gemini, if that means anything to you.

I’m mixed Jamaican, Irish, and Polish, with naturally curly short hair that I love experimenting with (currently chestnut brown, sometimes blonde 😌).

A lot of my free time goes into writing and occasionally illustrating. My dream is to create a novella or graphic novel, and my ideas are constantly evolving—so if you enjoy giving opinions or brainstorming, we’ll get along well.

I love cozy moments: reading together, cooking dinner, comfort shows, and long late-night talks. I’m really into anything Jim Henson-related, adult animation, and mixed-media shows (Bojack Horseman, King of the Hill, DHMIS, American Dad). I love scary movies. Not big on anime, but always open to learning about new interests.

I enjoy putting effort into my appearance when I go out—but at home I’m definitely messy hair and sweats.

I’m 420-friendly and would prefer if you were too, left-leaning, spiritually open-minded, and I strongly value kindness, empathy, and emotional intelligence.

About you:

I’m typically attracted to men who are taller and a little older (about 4–7 years max, please don't message me if you're over 30 or under 25), confident, emotionally intelligent, and genuinely passionate about something in their life.

Bonus points for tattoos, long hair (especially ❤️), stubble, beautiful eyes, and unique hobbies.

I’m drawn to men who:

~ Dress well when we go out

~ Communicate openly

~ Have a good sense of humor

~ Are affectionate

~ Remember the little details

~ Aren’t afraid to be romantic - I like a man with a lot of initiative 

Your job doesn’t matter to me as long as you care about what you do—if you love it, I’ll happily listen to you talk about it endlessly.


Important things to know:

Physical intimacy is very important to me in a relationship if we get there. I have a high libido and value affection, touch, and sexual compatibility—but only once there’s emotional connection and trust. I’m not looking to rush anything; I just believe in being honest about expectations so we’re aligned long-term.

I don’t do casual sex. I believe in slow-burn relationships that build connection, safety, and intention first.

I’m bisexual. While it’s not a requirement, I do find myself especially comfortable with partners who are also bi or genuinely open-minded. Shared perspective, curiosity, and respect matter to me, and I value being able to explore connection openly within a committed relationship.

I’m recently out of a long-term relationship. I’ve taken time to grieve and heal, and now feel ready to slowly put myself back out there—no rushing, no pressure, just honesty. If you’re looking to lock something down immediately, we likely won’t be aligned.

A few potential deal breakers (and that’s okay):

I don’t drive yet (working on it—anxiety is real)

I’m very 420-friendly and prefer someone who is too

I can be stubborn

I can’t host due to a strict lease but I prefer to meet in public anyways for the first while (hopefully temporary)

Clear communication and emotional intelligence matter a lot to me


What I bring to the table:

I’m nurturing, loyal, and deeply caring.

If you’re sick, expect homemade soup, Vicks on your chest, and lots of affection.

I love cooking and baking—learning your favorite meals, packing lunches, and experimenting in the kitchen. My cheesy garlic shrimp pasta is a personal favorite.

I went to school for Esthetics and Business Management, so facials, massages, manicures, and cozy self-care nights come standard (custom face masks and trash TV and or YouTube Rabbit holes included).

Final thoughtsss:

Attraction matters a lot to me—pics are very much appreciated and will be returned if I’m interested. Preference for those who share Pics 

Messages that show you actually read this will stand out. Please include a brief description and a/s/l.

If you think we’d genuinely vibe, I’d love to hear from you. I’m looking for something real, respectful, romantic, and low-pressure—just two people getting to know each other and seeing where it goes.

If you’re patient, emotionally aware, and understand that chemistry includes both emotional and physical connection over time, we’ll likely get along very well.




If you actually read this all the way through firstly y Thank you!! Tell me what stood out to you or why you think we’d vibe. Response may be delayed as I'm certain my DMs will be flooded and I'll also be playing on my switch 🙂‍↕️",1,1770760165.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False
1r1ebzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1r1ebzh/flavor_differences/,Flavor differences,"I’ve been going to Dutch Bros for over ten years, I get the same coffee based drink every time, but often it tastes different, sometimes even not good at all. Can anyone who works at Dutch help me pinpoint what could be going wrong? As far as I know the ingredients are the espresso shots, the torani flavor syrup, and the creamer so there’s not much that could go wrong. I’ve played with it so much that the only thing I can think of that could be the issue is bad espresso shots or a change in the beans. I’ve had it where it doesn’t taste sweet enough in sort of a bland way, and times where it isn’t sweet enough but with a very strong bitter flavor. Also times where it’s way too sweet but that’s easily solved as the barista not adding enough shots or putting in too much sweetener. In instances where it seems not sweet enough I’ve often gotten extra sweetener on the side and added it, occasionally this helps some but when the drink truly tastes bad it doesn’t help. And yes I know the recipes changed some time ago so I do order extra sweet. Can anyone who works there tell me how often the beans change, or if it’s possible to make a shot so bad that it completely changes the flavor profile? I can’t even pin it down to certain baristas being bad at making the drink because usually the drink will just taste bad for a couple days up to a week and then go back to being good again.",1,1770760137.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False

I've got a pretty serious ankle surgery coming up, and I'm gonna have six weeks of non-weight-bearing time where I'll be mostly stuck on the couch with a cast on my leg. I don't have any kind of home studio setup, but I'm hoping that maybe I can keep my spirits high during my recovery by working on some pottery while I rest.

I'm hoping for some help figuring out a plan for how I can safely make this happen! I imagine that a lot of the plan is just ""sit in one spot and play with clay, try and clean up best you can"". What I'm trying to figure out is if there are any roadblocks I can anticipate, any ways I can set things up to make them as easy as possible, any tools that might be helpful, any projects that might be a particularly good candidate for doing from the couch while I elevate my leg, etc.

I've been both hand building and wheel throwing since August (one class of each per month), so I'm still fairly new but I have a rough lay of the land. I usually get free use of the studio clay with my classes, but I won't have that during this period, so I'll have to buy some of my own clay and talk with the studio about firing. I imagine that learning to reclaim might be a tall order while immobile, so maybe I don't worry about that until I'm healed up.

Here's what I have: a crap ton of general pottery tools, a coffee table next to me, a wooden tray I can use in my lap as a small workspace, a banding wheel, and a very supportive husband who I can enlist to help me with cleanup and to carry things to and from my spot. My husband does not do pottery, but he can follow basic directions like a champ.

What I assume I'm gonna need to figure out: storing work, storing clay, managing mess, not poisoning myself or my husband with clay dust, and probably some things I haven't thought of yet. Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",1,1770760133.0,Pottery,2,1.0,False

1r1ebk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mint99/comments/1r1ebk5/best_countertop_microwaves_2026/,Best Countertop Microwaves 2026,"Hi all

If you are not familiar with us, we are from Requiremints (operating also the Mint99 product research platform) and we spend our time digging through specs and reviews so you don't have to. We recently reviewed 30+ options of countertop microwaves across different price ranges.

Here are a few things to keep in mind before you buy:

* **Internal capacity vs footprint** \- Always measure your counter space first. A 2.2 cu. ft. model is great for big turkeys but eats up massive counter real estate compared to a 0.9 cu. ft. model.
* **Inverter technology** \- If you hate when food is lava on the edges and frozen in the middle, look for this. It delivers a steady stream of power rather than pulsing on and off.
* **Wattage equals speed** \- Higher wattage means faster cooking. 700 watts is fine for dorms, but 1000 to 1200 watts is the standard for efficient family meal prep.
* **Combo features** \- Some new models are 3-in-1s with air frying and convection. They are great space savers but usually have a steeper learning curve than standard buttons.

# Large Capacity & Family Sized

These are best for big households with plenty of counter space.

* **\[Best Value Large\] Toshiba 2.2 Cu. Ft. Countertop Microwave Oven (ML4-EM22PAIT(SS)** \- A total workhorse for families. The inverter tech stops cold spots, and the sensor prevents rubbery overcooked food. It fits large dishes easily without costing a fortune.
* **\[Best Large Inverter\] Panasonic 2.2 Cu. Ft. Countertop Inverter Microwave (NN-SD975S)** \- The top pick for consistent heating. Its cyclonic inverter is amazing for delicate tasks like defrosting, and the massive interior fits almost anything you need to cook.
* **\[Great Value Inverter\] Panasonic 2.2 Cu. Ft. Countertop Inverter Microwave Oven (NN-SN98JS)** \- Very similar to the model above but often found at a better price point. It has a huge 16.5-inch turntable and provides reliable, even heat for big meals.
* **\[Best Budget Large\] Toshiba 2.2 Cu. Ft. Countertop Microwave (ML2-EM62P)** \- A solid choice if you need the big 2.2 cu. ft. size but want to save money. It lacks inverter tech but still has a smart humidity sensor for good results.
* **\[Solid Large Basic\] Farberware 2.2 Cu. Ft. Countertop Microwave (FMO22ABT)** \- A straightforward, high-power option. It skips the fancy bells and whistles but hits 1100 watts and is reliable for reheating big family platters or casseroles.
* **\[Reliable Large Option\] Sharp 2.2 Cu.Ft. Countertop Microwave Oven (SMC2266KS)** \- Another strong contender for big families. It has a nice stainless finish, sensor cooking to avoid guessing times, and handles heavy daily usage really well.

# Medium & Everyday Use

The sweet spot for most kitchens, balancing size and power.

* **\[Best Budget Medium\] Toshiba 1.2 Cu. Ft. Countertop Microwave (EM131A5C)** \- This is arguably the most practical buy for most people. It fits a standard dinner plate, has a smart sensor for easy reheating, and the price is very reasonable.
* **\[Best Budget Inverter\] Toshiba 1.6 Cu. Ft. Countertop Inverter Microwave (ML-EM45PIT)** \- Offers that smooth inverter heating in a manageable size. It fits a 12-inch pizza, runs quieter than many others, and keeps food texture much better than standard microwaves.

# Compact & Small Spaces

Perfect for apartments, dorms, or reheating coffee.

* **\[Excellent Quiet Mini\] Breville 0.9 Cu. Ft. Wave Soft-Close Countertop Microwave (BMO650)** \- Perfect if you hate loud door slamming. It features a unique soft-close door and runs very quietly. It feels premium and fits small spaces, though it costs a bit more.
* **\[Best Retro Budget\] Comfee 0.9 cu.ft Countertop Microwave Oven (CMO-MMP02)** \- Pick this if you want style on a budget. The retro design looks great in small apartments. It is lower power at 900 watts but handles basics perfectly.
* **\[Best Ultra Budget\] Chefman 0.7 Cu. Ft. Countertop Microwave Oven (RJ55-7-V2)** \- The ultimate space-saver. It is low power (700W), so cooking takes longer, but it is super cheap and fits in tiny dorm corners where nothing else will.
* **\[Best Compact Budget\] Farberware 0.9 Cu. Ft. Countertop Microwave (FM09)** \- A step up from the Chefman with more power. It is still small enough for tight counters but strong enough to actually cook a meal, not just warm coffee.

# Multifunction (Air Fryer & Convection)

For those who want to replace multiple appliances with one unit.

* **\[Best Value Combo\] Toshiba 1.0 Cu. Ft. 8-in-1 Countertop Convection Air Fryer Microwave (ML2-EC10SA)** \- A jack of all trades. It microwaves, air frys, and bakes. The manual knobs take some learning, but it saves space by combining three appliances into one.
* **\[Best Versatile Small\] GE 3-in-1 Microwave Oven (GCST10A1WSS)** \- Great for small kitchens needing versatility. The broil mode melts cheese nicely, and the air fry function crisps food decently well for a combo unit.

I'm only 31 and was told I was in the beginning stages of gum disease around 8 years ago. Since then i've tried flossing everyday (doesn't always happen, I will say that), I brush 2 x a day, I bought a fancy electronic toothbrush as well (I only use it in the evenings being careful not to overbrush), spend loads on an extra strong mouth guard, use medicated mouthwash and toothpaste, and STILL have issues!!!! 

I'm sick of it at this point. I don't eat a lot of sugary items, I'll have a coffee or fizzy drink maybe once a month, I cut down massively on drinking and smoking a year ago, and nothing seems to be working... my gums are receding, they're always inflamed or itchy or bleeding..all it takes is missing one or two days of a floss and it all comes back. they're too sensitive to get it whitened as well, so just don't look healthy. 

To top it off I had braces as a kid, and my lower teeth have moved back into it's original position. the dentist thinks they  might have also weakened the gums as we can't figure out why else they would be so temperamental?? What pisses me off the most is that I always visit the dentist, my parents drilled it into my how important oral health is. Yet there are people I know who don't put in half of the effort, with worse lifestyles, walking around with no issue??? ",12,1770760048.0,Vent,10,1.0,False

1r1e7g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1r1e7g9/friends/,Friends,"My history: as a child, I was not allowed to watch TV, so I never really got into this show, which started when I was eleven. It was a huge hit throughout my teen years so I knew it existed, but I couldn’t have told you much of anything about it (except of course that, like all TV shows, it was evil, especially so because it occasionally mentioned sex).

In 2004 I went off to college and had sustained access to TV for the first time, just in time for all the hype about the show’s finale. I still didn’t really get into it, but I think I learned some of the characters’ names and faces.

My wife had a very different experience of the 90s and early Zeroes, so this show is a touchstone for her. I think she rewatches an episode at least every few weeks, and has gotten through the whole thing at least twice since we got married. This latest time around, I decided to join her on a non-exhaustive basis. I watched maybe twenty episodes, more or less at random but weighted towards the later seasons.

Perhaps I’m outing myself as very basic and simple, or maybe it’s a generational difference, or maybe just the simplest question of taste, but this show is *funny.* Pretty much every episode gave me at least one big laugh, and a whole lot of smaller ones too.

The performances are really good; David Schwimmer stands out because I [encountered](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1khh3zx/happy_ve_day_band_of_brothers/) [him](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1kw80o5/happy_memorial_day_band_of_brothers_part_2_of_3/) [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1kw8kfz/happy_memorial_day_band_of_brothers_part_3_of_3/) years before I saw any of his Friends work, playing aggressively against (but also perfectly with) the character type he established on Friends. He’s brilliant here.

Jennifer Aniston is so funny that I believe the rumor that she had to choose between this show and SNL. Matt LeBlanc is brilliant, and his appearance on the 2021 reunion show (which I also saw at some point) reveals him as very thoughtful and much smarter than his character ever let him look.\*1

It’s too bad that Courteney Cox never got a chance to play Wonder Woman. She really, really looks the part, and she’s a good actor.

.

I do, of course, have some not-entirely-positive thoughts about certain elements. For starters, I was really surprised by how conservative the show is. My ultra-conservative upbringing held that this show (and pretty much all TV shows made for an audience over the age of 10) was unacceptably vulgar, sexualized, and so on. But upon actually watching it I’m struck by how tame it is; the characters have sex, yes, but only pretty far offscreen, and only in the most 90s-conventional ways. I suppose it was kind of daring, circa 2003, for an unmarried career-woman character to have a baby, but she ends up ditching her career to marry the father, and of course said father has been *heavily* established as her One True Love, because, despite all my adult authority figures’ moral panicking, network TV strongly agreed with them that heterosexual monogamy was the only lifestyle that deserved to be taken seriously.

And speaking of that whole situation, which dominates the show’s final episodes: is *that* how the Ross/Rachel thing ends? We’re supposed to just assume that her setting her whole life on fire on a whim is a good thing? For a man whose first post-arson move is to dig up a ‘transgression’ from long ago that never meant anything and he should have let go within minutes, but about which he still clearly harbors significant resentment? Girl. [RUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qHeMuztXjU)!

And the show ends right there? Without showing us what happens even a few minutes after that? Which is bound to be a lot more interesting than anything that happened to either of them in the 10 seasons of the show?

And while there’s a lot to like about this show, I can never forgive it for always putting the Central Perk sign facing the wrong way. We’re inside the coffee shop!

\*1 The pitfall of playing a stupid character is that if you do it really well, people will assume that the actor is stupid, never realizing that an actor would have to be really smart and skilled to play any character that well. I call this the Early Keanu Reeves Problem: it’s easy to forget due to what’s come since, but Keanu’s career stalled for pretty much the whole decade of the 90s, largely because no one could see him as anything other than the absolute numbskull he played with transcendent convincingness in the Bill and Ted movies. Honorable mention to Manny Jacinto, who played his [absolute-numbskull character](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/ua8xx9/the_good_place/) so well that I’m always *stunned* whenever I see him playing a non-stupid character anywhere else.",1,1770759840.0,LookBackInAnger,0,1.0,False

I’ll skip the jargon and get straight to the point.

A few of us are working on **VibeNest**, a new social app focused on helping people make **real-world plans,** not endless chats or flaky “we should meet sometime” conversations.

Before doing anything big, we’re running a **private beta in Hyderabad**, starting this weekend, across a few major areas in the city.

The idea is simple:

* City-wide lunches, dinners, coffee meetups, and small activities
* People join plans that fit their vibe
* Small groups, intentional participation, actually showing up

No dating angle.  
No mass invites.  
Just people who enjoy meeting others through clear, low-pressure plans.

For now, we’re only opening a **waitlist** so we can keep this controlled and learn properly.

If this sounds interesting, you can join here:

1r1dwtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/13Psalm/comments/1r1dwtt/episode_17_rules_of_engagement/,Episode 17 — Rules of Engagement,"#  APPALACHIA — FORWARD SITE

They don’t leave.

The Goatman isn’t dealt with, and Lou refuses to turn this into a hit-and-run problem that resurfaces six months later with a higher body count.

They establish a forward site in an abandoned ranger station—rotting wood, cracked windows, a generator that hates being alive.

Good enough.

Good enough forces honesty.

# THE STATEMENT

Lou gathers them in the main room.

No whiteboard at first. No ceremony.

“We stay,” Lou says. “We don’t rotate. We don’t escalate. We don’t pretend this is solved.”

Martinez watches faces. No pushback.

“This thing doesn’t fight like people,” Lou continues. “Which means our instincts are liabilities until proven otherwise.”

Jane leans against the wall, arms crossed. Still. Closed.

Medina tilts his head, studying her like a math problem.

# RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

Lou writes them by hand.

Slow. Deliberate.

# RULE ONE — NO RESPONSE

>

“If it says your name,” Lou says, “you ignore it.”

“If it sounds like someone you love,” Jane adds calmly, “you ignore it harder.”

# RULE TWO — NO PURSUIT

>

Vega exhales. “That’s against every instinct I have.”

“Yes,” Lou replies. “That’s why it’s a rule.”

# RULE THREE — NO ISOLATION

>

“One anchor,” Lou says. “One observer. One responder.”

No exceptions.

# RULE FOUR — CONTROL THE REACTION

>

Lou doesn’t soften it.

“Fear gives you data. Panic gives it permission.”

# RULE FIVE — ENGAGEMENT IS EXPERIMENTAL

>

Martinez frowns. “You’re saying we accept damage?”

“We accept uncertainty,” Lou replies.

Jane nods once. “That’s worse.”

# MEDINA BECOMES A PROBLEM (ON PURPOSE)

Training starts disciplined.

Then Medina ruins it.

He rearranges schedules without warning.  
Changes patrol routes mid-walk.  
Blasts polka music at 0300 and shuts it off ten seconds later.  
Leaves tools where they don’t belong.  
Paints numbers on trees that don’t mean anything.

Vega finally snaps. “What the hell are you doing, man?”

Medina doesn’t look up from zip-tying a cowbell to a doorframe.

“Introducing noise.”

Lou watches. Doesn’t stop him.

Medina turns, serious now.

“This thing predicts,” he says. “It models. It learns patterns.”

He gestures vaguely at the woods.

“I’m making us unreadable.”

Silence.

Then—

“Also,” Medina adds, nodding at Jane, “she’s been standing like that for forty minutes.”

Jane doesn’t move.

Medina squints. “You aura farming?”

Jane blinks.

Once.

Then breaks—laughs, sharp and real, hand flying to her mouth like she surprised herself.

The room freezes.

Vega stares. “Holy shit. She laughs.”

Jane exhales, embarrassed. “Don’t make it weird.”

Medina grins. “Too late.”

The tension fractures.

That matters more than anyone says out loud.

# TRAINING CONSIDERATIONS — BREAK THE BODY FIRST

They stop protecting themselves from exhaustion.

Sleep deprivation becomes deliberate.

Four hours.  
Then three.  
Then two.

Random wake-ups.  
False alarms.  
Recorded voices played through the trees while they run drills half-awake.

Lou makes them move while exhausted.

Carry weight.  
Solve problems.  
Recite facts.

Name. Date. Location. Mission.

Who hesitates.  
Who reacts.  
Who listens.

Jane watches all of it.

She doesn’t participate.

She doesn’t need to.

She can tell which voices are wrong immediately.

The rest of them have to earn that instinct.

Vega breaks down once.

Sits on the floor, shaking, convinced he heard his sister.

Nolasco sits with him. Grounds him. No judgment.

They reset.

Again.

Again.

# VOICE DISCIPLINE

Medina escalates.

He splices voices mid-sentence.  
Cuts recordings just before emotional payoff.

The goal isn’t to trick them.

It’s to teach their brains the difference between **signal and manipulation**.

Jane finally speaks during one session.

“If it wants something,” she says, “it’ll rush the emotion.”

“If it’s real,” she adds, “it won’t need to.”

That becomes doctrine.

# WEAPONS & TOOLS — ADAPTIVE, NOT HEROIC

They stop asking what kills it.

They ask what disrupts it.

# SOUND

Irregular noise patterns.

Not alarms.

Chaos.

Cowbells. Air horns. Feedback loops.

Medina randomizes activation so even they don’t know what’s next.

The Goatman hates that.

# FIRE

Not for destruction.

For denial.

Flares to cut off movement. Controlled heat zones.

Fire forces choices.

# AMMUNITION

Heavier rounds. Slower.

Not to penetrate—to register impact.

“Pain might not matter,” Medina says, “but interruption does.”

# EDGED TOOLS

Silver stays available.

Not mysticism.

Contrast.

Jane never touches them.

No one asks why.

# THE REALIZATION

Three nights in, the Goatman comes close.

No voices.

Just movement.

It circles.  
Tests.  
Waits for someone to chase.

No one does.

Medina triggers three noise sources at once.

Then none.

Then one behind it.

The woods go still.

For the first time—

the Goatman hesitates.

Jane watches from the porch.

“That,” she says quietly, “is confusion.”

Lou nods.

They’re not winning.

But they’re no longer predictable.

# CONTROLLED DEGRADATION

By the fourth night, their bodies are wrecked.

Not injured.

Worn down.

Hands shake just enough to notice. Knees ache when they stand. Eyes burn constantly, like they forgot how to blink.

But their senses?

Sharp.

Too sharp.

They hear insects moving under leaves. Smell damp earth shift with the wind. Every sound lands with meaning now, not panic.

Lou watches them closely.

They’re exhausted enough to look vulnerable.

Not exhausted enough to be sloppy.

That matters.

# THE COFFEE

Just before dawn, Lou does something unexpected.

He pulls a dented percolator out of a crate.

Vega stares at it like a religious artifact.

“No shit,” Vega whispers. “Is that—”

“Yes,” Lou says. “Coffee.”

Medina blinks. “Sir, with respect—this feels like a trap.”

Lou pours anyway.

Not much.  
No sugar. No cream.  
Just bitter, grounding heat.

“Drink,” Lou says. “Slow.”

They do.

The caffeine doesn’t fix the exhaustion.

It sharpens it.

Turns fatigue into something focused.

Jane watches from the porch, arms crossed again.

Medina clocks it immediately.

“Careful,” he says. “She’s back to aura farming.”

Jane snorts. Then laughs again, quieter this time.

“Shut up,” she says, without bite.

Lou allows it.

That also matters.

# THE THEORY

Martinez leans against the railing, cup shaking slightly.

“So this is part of it?”

Lou nods.

“Predators don’t go after the strongest version of you,” he says.  
“They go after the version that looks like it’s about to fail.”

Jane adds softly, “But still aware enough to suffer.”

Medina grimaces. “So we’re seasoning ourselves.”

Lou doesn’t smile.

“We’re making ourselves believable.”

Vega exhales. “Like a fat guy to a Golden Corral.”

Silence.

Then Gonzales mutters, “That’s… disturbingly accurate.”

Lou doesn’t correct the analogy.

# FINAL RULE (UNWRITTEN)

Lou adds nothing to the board.

He just says it.

“We don’t break first.”

No one argues.

Because now they understand:

They’re not trying to overpower the Goatman.

They’re letting it believe—

just long enough—

that it finally has the advantage.

# CLOSING

They sit there, exhausted, wired, alive in a way that hurts.

Coffee cups empty.  
Hands steady enough.  
Bodies wrecked just enough.

Out in the woods, something shifts its weight.

Not retreating.

Not advancing.

Waiting for weakness that doesn’t come.

Jane watches the tree line.

Inside her, the presence stirs again.

Not amused.  
Not threatened.

Interested.

Because this is new.

**Prey that engineers its own vulnerability.**

1r1dw57,https://naokimatcha.com/products/chiran-harvest-matcha,My matcha mini journey so far,"I grew up not liking green tea much in restaurants, because the ones I had were generally with Japanese restaurant meals, most were fishy and bitter.  With the expansion of boba and tea places everywhere, I expanded from drinking oolong or black teas into green tea.  I like tea that is refreshing and fragrant, and am fine with plain, unsweetened tea, whether room temp, cold, or hot.  I don't make tea lattes at home, except for matcha lattes.  When I go out, I can drink milk tea, but I get less or no sweet.  For matcha, I tend to use a bit of sweetener when I need to overcome bitterness.

It's just in the last several years, I've gotten into matcha more.  After enjoying some in shops, I I watched all the YouTube videos where people reviewed matcha... and noticed brick and mortar groceries were not getting good reviews at all.  I did try one once, but it was so terrible that I threw it out.  I also resisted going for the better quality matchas because I was afraid to spoil my palate and end up splurging all the time.

I found Jade Leaf to be okay, the first couple of batches (their ""ceremonial"" grade) I had tried had a pretty bright green color, both individual packet and the 100g bag.  Vegetal, zero bitterness, some actual fragrance and sweetness, really quite smooth and not grainy.  I was very pleased to have found something suitable for straight drinking usucha (cold or hot) and in lattes (doubled up).  My setup acquired a sifter to go with the battery powered double whisk.  I was making my matcha in a tall cup and hadn't bothered to try a chasen and chawan at all, thinking anyway, it costs more to get nice sets, and it might get damaged or broken.

But the last batches (maybe it's the time of year or I just got a bum bag) seem to be a little more astringent and bitter, and the color isn't so saturated. I know it can vary by season, but I was disappointed at the downturn in quality.  My husband got me a matcha sampler from Nioteas for Christmas, so I ended up spoiling my tastebuds even further.  The samples are 2g, so I tried each as cold usucha (yes, I know, I just usually don't go for hot tea because I'm afraid to burn it, even for coffee I have to use a thermometer and mix 140F water with cold to get it to 90F so it won't burn the coffee) and then added a touch of heavy cream/milk. Some of them were more umami and broke through milkiness, others were more bitter, one was really sweet and fragrant (Kagoshima).  After that, I went back to use up more of my last batch of Jade Leaf, and the comparison made it even worse.  I'm still using it up, but it's not fun.

So, I thought it might be time to try switching it up.  I cancelled my Jade Leaf subscription, at least for now.  (Maybe spring season there will be a better batch, who knows if I will risk it?)  Before I make the leap to something even more expensive (Ippodo, MK, others) (Jade Leaf has gone up from around $40/100g to $55), I decided to order a Naoki Chiran Harvest (40g) to try, which is a similar price point (and easy for me to buy off Amzn since I'm US based).

Nioteas doesn't have a flavor graph for all the samples I tried, there are some other specifically named matchas on the website, but it's under each type and not a definitive guide for what I received as samples.  I think the sample set contains two ""Chiran"" ones, but I haven't tried all the samples yet.  I'll get to those this week, but anyway, I'm crossing my fingers that I like this Naoki one, and that I'm able to get it reliably :D  Otherwise, I might need to investigate other teas to try.",1,1770759122.0,MatchaEverything,0,1.0,False

What to do...,"I'm not even expecting anything from most of my friends at this point in life for birthday or holidays, but my one friend from childhood (I'm talking age 5) gifts things that are cheap or just totally unuseful to me. For example, never in my life have I ever liked coffee, matcha, or the likes. She gifted me a matcha set. One year for Christmas we specifically asked each other what we would find useful or would like. I shared that mascara would be a small but useful gift to me. Instead, she bought one of the cheap lip glosses you get at a store like Marshall's and that time I did gently ask what made her go another course. I don't even recall her answer at this point. As a house warming gift to me, she gifted me a sound/white noise machine when all of my life (including our many many sleepovers) I never once relied on noise. The intentions are good I think, but the gifts are honestly a waste of her money at this point and I rather get nothing or a small venmo to get lunch or something. Would you bother to tell a close friend they have historically been a bad gifter or would you just say no gifts moving forward? Any advice is appreciated. 

And as for the gifts I wouldn't use, I regift, donate, or sell on Facebook. I hope that's not shitty to do, but it would only be clutter in my apartment.",1,1770758930.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

With more people working from home, spaces need to be flexible.

# Top Uses

* Home offices that double as guest rooms

# How to Choose the Right Trend for You

Here’s a quick checklist:

 **Start with what you already have**  
 **Pick one main theme** (e.g., earthy + modern, boho + natural)  
 **Add 1–2 statement pieces**  
 **Balance color, texture, and lighting**  
 **Allow your personality to show**

Decorating isn’t just following trends — it’s creating a space where you **feel comfortable, inspired, and at peace**.

Although the twist was very predictable, I loved experiencing everything unfold. There were also hints at next books theme and I thought that was cute. I also enjoyed the star-crossed lovers of it all as well as the sweet moments from the Epilogue.

I have my regular resume for like entry level corporate stuff and I wanted to make a service resume for restaurant jobs, which I have less experience doing, but I wanted to get into serving bc of the tips. I do think it’s relevant that I am 28 and my boyfriend is 40 so we have different experiences, I consider him old school in almost every way.

So anyway, I was working on my server resume and I had 3 jobs listed that I did before I got into corporate so like 9 years ago. I was asking my bf if he thought it was enough or was okay because I wanted to make sure it was diverse enough I’d get hired at a coffee shop, or a restaurant, or whatever. He was already kind of irritated w the conversation bc he was already telling me I was doing too much, it’s not that serious, I have plenty of experience I’ll get hired.

however, where I am in the US is one of the highest COL counties and the economy sucks absolute ass rn. I’ve read all over my county subreddit of people who have been job hunting for months, if not a year or two. I’ve read of many people who have gotten turned down for Amazon jobs, fast food jobs, target/walmart jobs bc there are 1. SO many people looking for work rn and 2. they are overqualified were laid off and many of these places would rather hire a “lifer” (someone who will spend their life working there) than someone who will leave in a year when a better opportunity comes along. I did not want to fall into the second category, because I already suffer from the first.

so when I said like I want to diversify my resume he was like “BITCH I’ve done this!!!!” and immediately, I just hung up. I understand he’s frustrated, he thinks I’m doing too much to get a server job, he’s done this far longer than I have, and he has more experience than me which is something he constantly is reminding me of, that I have no life experience bc we got together when I was 23 and atp, I’m convinced he sees me as a kid. All of that under consideration, I still didn’t want to be spoken to like that. I didn’t want to be yelled at, lectured, or sitting on the phone listening to someone call me a bitch. I just don’t need that rn I’m stressed enough as it is.

 he got upset and texted me immediately afterwards “diversify my resume I’ve done this shit over and over. Restaurants don’t  give a fuck training is always there smh” I want to be like oh yah? I never heard of training what is that? Because wtf??? clearly restaurants have the capability to be picky choosy since there are so many people looking for work rn. 

  
anyway, now he’s ignoring me, went MIA, and idk when I’ll hear from him or how the night will go. i feel bad bc I’m like if I didn’t over react, we could’ve had a normal day but I got upset and hung up the phone the rest of the night is fucked up. I feel like it shouldnt be my fault, but it is. 



TLDR: my bf called me a bitch so I hung up the phone, which made him upset and ruined everyone’s night.

I’m heading to Florence next week for a solo trip. I’m a 30-year-old woman traveling alone, and I’m starting to lock in my food plan, so I figured I’d ask here.

During the day, I’m pretty set. I’ll mostly be eating on the go: panini, pizza slices, pastries, quick coffee stops, that kind of thing. I don’t love spending a big chunk of my day sitting down waiting for service when I could be out exploring, so daytime food for me is more about fast, good, and casual.

Evenings are different though. I do want to enjoy proper meals at night, because… Italy 🇮🇹. Food is a huge part of the trip for me. That said, since I’m traveling solo, I’m not really looking for very lively, high-energy places where everyone’s in big groups and it feels a bit awkward to be alone. I’m more into trattorias and osterias with a relaxed, local vibe where eating solo feels totally normal. Somewhere chill where I can just enjoy my meal, people-watch, maybe journal or read, or just scroll on my phone in peace.

So far, these are the places I’ve found and added to my list:

	•	Osteria del Cinghiale Bianco

	•	Trattoria Camillo

	•	Il Latini

	•	Trattoria Sostanza

	•	Trattoria Mario

I’d love to hear what you think about these. I’ve seen mixed reviews about Osteria del Cinghiale Bianco, but honestly, the photos really made me want to go. It just looks like my kind of place. I’ve also heard Trattoria Sostanza is very authentic, which is exactly what I’m hoping for.

I’ll be staying at Hotel Bernini Palace, so recommendations not too far from there would be amazing, but I’m open if something is truly worth the walk.

I’m also very happy to take suggestions for:

	•	Great panini spots

	•	Pizza by the slice

	•	Coffee places

	•	Bakeries / pastry spots

Basically anything good, local, and authentic, and ideally not a tourist trap.

Thanks so much in advance for any tips or recommendations 🙏 I really appreciate the help and can’t wait to experience Florence properly.",4,1770758624.0,florence,2,1.0,False
1r1dnuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1r1dnuo/apartment_neighbor_harassing_my_dog_and_then/,"Apartment neighbor harassing my dog and then submitting complaints to landlord, city and animal control","Location: Minneapolis, MN

I live in an apartment building with my 8 year old dog. In the 8 years I have had her, there has been zero complaints about her.

When I first moved in, I left notes at my neighbors doors letting them know that with the new environment, it may take several days for her to adjust and when I leave, she may cry and whine. I left my phone number and email for anyone to contact me if there’s any issues.

The first day back at work, my neighbor called the police saying I abandoned my animal. Cops were unable to gain access to the building so animal control stopped by and said there was no reason to believe my dog was neglected. 

One year later, this past November with no other complaints, this same neighbor was fighting with her boyfriend at 2am. Screaming, breaking stuff and by 4am it spilled into the hallway where the bf was screaming racial slurs. I told them to stop, asked the guy to leave (he isn’t on the lease nor a tenant) and when this happened he shoved me, tried to punch me and also tried to enter my apartment unit. The neighbor told me she called the cops and they are on the way and so I don’t need too. At this point I had no reason to suspect she was lying and so I got ready for work and left without calling 911. Turns out she never did either.

Since this incident however, when her and her bf fight and throw things against the bedroom wall that runs adjacent to my kitchen, it scares my dog. She paces around the apartment whining. This causes my neighbor to then bang on the wall to get my dog to stop but instead my dog begins barking as she does if someone knocks on the door. This only makes matters worse. She has submitted several complaints about my dog barking to the landlord and city when this happens.

I have spoken to the landlord, they understand how this behavior can make my dog barking and have banned my neighbors bf from the property after I told them about the incident in the hallway and the constant fighting. 

This has only further aggravated my neighbor. 

This past Friday maintenance came to my apartment at 3pm, the knocking caused my dog to bark. Maintenance guy gave her some attention and within minutes she was calmed down, until my neighbor began pounding on the wall. This set my dog off. I took her out of the apartment and brought her to my car to take her for a car ride, as I ran up to my apartment to grab her blankets my neighbor began screaming at me in the hallway. A few minutes later after grabbing my items and speaking with maintenance who said they were going to report my neighbor to the office, I went back down to my car where she was on the phone with who I presume was the police or animal control claiming that there is an abandoned dog left in a car. 

Sunday morning as I was grinding my coffee beans in my kitchen (8am) she began pounding in my walls once again, screaming hysterically al through the wall to “shut the f\*ck up” setting my dog off. I had to play music and my tv to drown out the noise.

One other neighbor heard this and reached out to me stating they complained to managment about her banging and screaming. Another neighbor told me that any slight noise my dog makes while I’m at work will cause this neighbor to bang on the wall which makes everything worse for my dog. 

During these episodes she submit complaints to the city who has now sent me three notices. Threatening to issue fines or other legal measures if nothing is resolved.

The time frames she claims my dog was barking doesn’t align with the fact that during these reported hours, I am home and my dog wasn’t barking. My neighbors below me also dispute this neighbors claims. She claims my dog will be barking from 5am until 5pm, I leave at 545 for work, back by 2pm and my dog wasn’t barking before or after work. My neighbors below said on one of the days, my dog wasn’t barking before barking from 7am until 730-7:40 and then she was quiet.

It seems that my neighbor submitting these complaints is not only aggravating my dog with the banging but also exaggerating the time frames. What can I do to show the city that my neighbor is the main factor to why my dog has been barking and that these time frames are grossly exaggerated, if even true?",0,1770758613.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

Thank You all for Birthday wishes - I'm 40 now... ;)  
  
I was quite busy for past few days thats why didn't post almost anything...  
At the same time i want to keep certain level of quality for my photos that you propably already expect.  
Thats one of the reasons that i post less that propably could - when im not happy with photo im getting bit depressed that doesn't help at all... People that do creative things should know what i mean.  
At the same time i dont want to give up - and that's why doing simplest things is a great solution.  
  
Figures are great, cute and really photogenic - so simple portrait photos are good option and solution to creativity block.  
  
Not only you dont have to think much about about background and many other elements - it's a great practice for everyone, especially when you dont have much equipment - even single lamp can work.  
  
More than that - you will practice composition of your photo - how you will set your figure will give you different vibe. Playing with single light will prepare you before using more light cources - but also you might discover that you can do great pictures without buying to many lights.  
Still more - you have great oportunity to practice your editing skills - color grading in lightroom for example.  
  
So look how much can you get just by practicing portrait photography  Yes, it's simple form but without it you wont improve - so instead of not doing anything, DO SOMETHING   
  
Soon i will try to show you how different can be photo just by placing figure in many ways.  
  
BTS. I noticed that after editing photo - additionally - editing eyes give more life to figure, photo is more eye cathing.

1r1dl6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r1dl6f/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her, fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born; tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday. Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then... silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it, cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog, a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile, as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors, backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper, quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons, a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye, plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later, cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car, Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest, just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing, one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically, his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill, fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine, but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still, not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy, maybe six, slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened, the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back, a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet, parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned, cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall, Miller Park, under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party, balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise, just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now, not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck, white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it, looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name, Eli Meyers, suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened, her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week, secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song, ""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely, but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him, something fragile and bright, had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports, all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins, events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there, mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love. Twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced, simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds, one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it. A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself, photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them, no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph, Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion, not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children, their heads drooping in the cold, and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then, slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still, the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox, the bus driver, took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed, small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone, a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now, typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now, something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",3,1770758438.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I woke, feeling a bit fragile, physically. I have never felt this way before…it passed quickly once I ate breakfast and had my coffee and water; then did yardwork.

My participation in a five (5) week Learn to Curl ended last week. I may sign up for league play? I have to choose between two levels. I’ll likely choose the level that I can sub-in in other leagues(?)

Physical activity keeps my mind clear and healthier I feel. Gets me out of the house and around people. 

I’m not writing this to negatively trash my deceased spouse. I’m not trying to fault find or seek sympathy for how we chose to live our marriage. I’m just trying to work through what emotionally dropped in my lap today.

For some reason, I began the day reliving issues that DH and I had over the years. 

Issues that deeply affected me and felt discounted by him or when discussing denied that he had any role in the event . He didn’t remember because it didn’t affect him, didn’t want accountability or he didn’t care, callus too often is how today’s memories are landing.

Absolutely painful events that I don’t even want to breathe life into, because they (still) cut to my emotional core. I now can see they were rooted in his insecurities, but at the time, he did a pretty good job gaslighting me into believing I was in the wrong. In my mind, these were not black and white issues, there was room for compromise.

Overall, we had a pretty equitable marriage. I know I had my own insecurities and we both did damage to our relationship along the way, yet managed to patch it back together, like long-haulers do (40 years). Therapy helped us both, but he was fine with just a bandaid, he was a man of his time, taught not to show much emotion. Me? I had perfected stuffing emotions. 

For as damaged as we both were when we met; it was likely the best relationship either of us could have hoped for or achieved. We loved and respected each other, gave each other room to grow and to be individuals and grew into a solid team. 

We didn’t make a habit of rehashing old bygones, once the dust had settled. Why am I doing it now?

As his illness progressed the last couple of years, he began to control peripheral things as much as he could, not seeming to care or acknowledge how I felt about whatever the topic was, he was trying to micromanage. Because he was so unwell and at times, in pain or medicated, I often acquiesced. I figured he was trying to control what was right in front of him, since he couldn’t control his health or what his body was doing. At least that is how I resolved it. 

It helps to write this out and not sink into recreation of each event, I can easily fall into to rolling them around in my head for hours…it used to be days. Terribly unhealthy for me. So I try to focus on the better seasons without glossing over it too much.

When I put as much effort and emphasis on ruminating over the joys and highlights of our life, I have to almost pinch myself to believe how well suited for each other we were.

I’m not sure what stage of grieving this is, but I’d rather not be dissecting our lives like this.

I miss companionship, but I never want to responsible to another human in that depth ever again. I never want to love that deeply again. 

Is this a real process of grieving or am I making things harder on myself than they need to be? What has helped you to get unstuck? Does any of this make sense? ",1,1770758320.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

Have lived abroad for 10 years, first as an international teacher and now retired on 2kish a month at 53. Have a pension kick in at 55 in 1.5 years and SS at 62 so in time have more to live on. 

I gave up on looking for a wife as dont want kids and never found a real connection. Have lived in Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Taiwan and Cambodia. Hate heat so no more Asia, Colombia is amazing was working there from 2010 to 2012 but have aging parents and want to be close to States. Mexico was the answer been here 2 years on consecutive 6 months tourist visas which may end one day but not worried as have figured it out. 

My Mexicana is in her 40s but looks 25. She works full time, kinda sucks as 50 hours work week is hard on her and she goes to the gym 5 days a week so time is sparse. She has 7 siblings and is very traditional. Has incredible integrity and have not seen one negative trait or behavior since started to get to know her and officially dating. She owns a house and property outside of a big city but lives with mom and siblings in the city. Never has asked for anything and is ecstatic for just a coffee date and walk around the Centro and plaza.

All I can say holy shit things move fast versus back in States. Established we were couple very quick after first date. I knew this from dating in Honduras and Colombia but this time is different as she is a keeper. Hope this post ages well as each day get deeper. Have zero desire to return to States, will be establishing our lives in Mexico, and looks like will be integrating more time visiting with her with her family. Im so much happier at this point than being single or playing around. I guess if I can succeed at this, its possible for young bucks out there looking for their dream partner.

I (33m) have been passionately playing drums for over 20 years.   Over the last 7-8 years I began following it professionally (investing in it, playing bigger shows, Networking, etc.).   Playing festivals & sold-out headlining shows was a rush.   Unfortunately, everyone's ego kicked in and eventually led to my old band (lets call them Panic at the Dollar Store or PADS) kicked me out because our guitarist (former drummer) wanted my spot and said I was unqualified & not good enough (I assure you this was not the case).  I founded and played in the band for years until they kicked me out for the drummer-turned-guitarist-turned-drummer.  PADS began to fizzle after I left so that was nice.   

I have always been a grateful, happy, positive dude so I made friends in the area. I was playing in local bands for about a year until I was approached by another group of dudes who wanted to write cool music & play shows.   Awesome!  That's all I really wanted.  New band (lets call them The Breakfast Burritos or BB) has been showing a lot of potential (first headlining show sold out, played a festival, first song blowing up).  For two years it was great!  We live an hour apart, but we began to take the band seriously.   Writing music, practicing, getting to know each other.  Until I went on vacation for 2 weeks.   Came back about 3 months ago and we stopped practicing entirely.  BB says its to write, which is part of the reason I joined: Shows & writing.   However, i'm not invited and have been feeling distant from the guys.   Ever since I returned, everyone (except the singer Mikey), has been awkward and not replying/communicating with me.  Could be my general paranoia, but it's how I feel.  I admit I have not been calling them, but phone calls go both ways right?  
  
Another fact, I stopped taking SSRI's when I came back from vacation and quit coffee for 4 weeks.   Things went ***dark*** and I got depressed again.   Like bad.   Struggling with purpose, crises, anxiety attacks, financial troubles, all of it.  I have been on the mend for about a week now, but havent really talked to the BB's.  At least I have The Breakfast Burritos to work towards and be excited about, right?   Right?    
  
Anyway, about a week ago, after I had not seen the BB's in months, we shot a music video.   At the video shoot, I was playing the song about 80% correct so I could go nuts and have fun.  Video magic works wonders.   Things were awkward at the shoot, but I figured its cuz we had not seen each other in a while.  I tried chatting with the dudes, but I was getting A LOT of cold shoulder.  Nobody said they had a problem with me or my playing, until a few days later when Mikey called me...     
  
Mikey called and said I was an embarrassment, said BB's drummer-turned-guitarist (let's call this one Guy) *did not like how I expressed gratitude* for a practicing tip he gave me months ago, mentioned how nobody really knows me, and basically said im on probation in the band.    Sucks to feel this way.   
  
I feel tied to being in a band since i've been in bands writing and playing shows for over 15 years.   The reason I joined BB was to play cool shows again and write music.  But having drama and unspoken animosity, that I had no clue was going on, sucks.   Hard.       
  
AIO for seeing the same problems in BB that I had with PADS, not wanting to deal with the bs, and contemplating leaving?     
AIO about not seeing BB and just let the guys do their thing without me until practice?

Then i was able to get some extra cash from family members and deposited $3000 and $5000 with a few days in between in December. I did hear about the 10k threshold but didn’t understand and stupidly did not do research about as i was told oh never deposit a big amount all at once for many many years. So the total wasn’t so big (if you add all three deposits total less than $10k). I was trying to help my sister pay some lawyer fees with my credit card so that money went to pay for it (i actually paid $12k for her with some of my money) and use the deposited money and pay for the credit card. 

Will i get in trouble for this? I am honestly scared. 

I know this sounds like structuring and i was just doing a research last night. It has been almost 2 months since i made my last deposit in person. Other than that i get paid biweekly from my job through the bank. I hope nothing happens to me i feel so dumb for not doing enough research before doing this.

The main one for me is a true, system-level smart privacy screen. What really caught my attention is that Samsung has already dropped a few teasers around this idea on their social media, which makes it feel like more than just wishful thinking.

The concept itself is pretty straightforward. Your phone would automatically protect your screen depending on where you are. If you’re in a crowded place like a plane, coffee shop, or rideshare, the display would subtly limit viewing angles so only you can clearly see what’s on screen. When you’re alone or at home, everything goes back to normal without you having to think about it.

As for how it could work, this feels very achievable with current hardware. Using a combination of the front camera, ambient sensors, and on-device AI, the phone could detect nearby faces or close movement around the display. The important part is that it’s automatic and handled locally on the device, so there’s no constant toggling and no cloud dependency.

This would be a great quality-of-life upgrade. We keep more and more sensitive information on our phones now, from banking and work messages to health data and personal conversations. Physical privacy screen protectors reduce clarity all the time, and software toggles are easy to forget. A dynamic system that only activates when it’s actually needed just makes sense.

One bonus feature I’d love is internal magnets for wireless charging and accessories. Wireless charging has gotten really good, but built-in magnets would make car mounts, stands, battery packs, and desk docks far more reliable. That said, I also get why this might not happen yet, especially on devices that support the S-Pen, where internal space and interference are real design trade-offs.

Between the privacy feature Samsung has already hinted at (https://news.samsung.com/global/coming-soon-a-new-layer-of-privacy) and everything expected from upcoming Galaxy devices, I’m genuinely excited to see what they announce next. If the focus shifts more toward smart, practical features like this instead of just spec bumps, that’s a big win.

1r1d858,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1r1d858/win_anyone_over_in_5_seconds_matthew_husseys/,Win anyone over in 5 seconds: Matthew Hussey's tricks that actually work (and the psychology behind them),"⚠️ Most people think charisma is this mysterious, unteachable “vibe” you’re born with. That you either have ""the spark"" or you don’t. But here’s the wild truth: charisma is often just applied psychology. The way Matthew Hussey breaks it down in *Get The Guy* isn’t just about flirting—it’s human communication 101. And yep, it can work in job interviews, networking, or even just talking to new people at the gym.

This post pulls from Hussey’s best advice, backed by behavioral science and social psychology research. Because honestly, there’s too much garbage on TikTok from people who mistake “confidence” for “talking over people.” And that just makes interactions weird and uncomfortable. So this is your no-BS guide to actually making people like you in the first 5 seconds.

Here’s what actually works:

- **Use the “slight playfulness” opener**  
  Hussey talks about leading with positivity and a *slightly* unexpected comment. Not full-on sarcasm. Not a joke. Just something slightly different from what the person usually hears. According to research in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* (2009), being distinctive in early interactions boosts likability. You want to stand out—but gently. Example: instead of “Nice to meet you,” say “You seem like trouble.” It’s low-stakes, light-hearted, but it shifts energy fast.

- **Match their *energy*, not just their words**  
  In *The Like Switch* by former FBI agent Jack Schafer, mirroring body language and tone is a proven way to build trust quickly. Hussey also uses this. If someone is calm and soft-spoken, don’t come in like a stand-up comic. If they’re energetic, match that vibe. Your nervous system syncs with theirs—which boosts connection fast.

- **Ask something emotionally-loaded, not just factual**  
  Instead of “What do you do?” try “What keeps you busy outside work?” or “What’s been the highlight of your week?” According to Vanessa Van Edwards from *Captivate*, emotionally engaging questions open up dopamine pathways, which makes people associate *you* with good feelings. Hussey uses this principle constantly in coaching—building rapport through curiosity, not resumes.

- **Use the “yes ladder”**  
  Get someone saying “yes” to small things. “You’re from around here, right?” “You love coffee?” A classic technique from Robert Cialdini’s research in *Influence*—the more people say yes, the more they feel aligned with you.

- **Stop overperforming. Underrated is magnetic.**  
  People smell try-hard energy from miles away. Hussey emphasizes *presence*, not performance. A 2021 Harvard Business Review study showed that people who listen well—and pause before responding—are rated as more charismatic than fast talkers. You don’t need to be the most exciting person in the room. Just real and tuned in.

All these tricks work because they’re rooted in how our brains are wired to build trust and connection. They’re not hacks—they’re human behavior. And literally anyone can learn them.",1,1770757651.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

I’d like to say we’re pretty similar in terms of hobbies and interests even family wise. We met on a dating app. Our first date was supposed to be coffee but then we started walking around looking at shops, one thing led to another we saw a movie played some games back at his and so on. 

I feel like I have strong feelings towards him like I want a relationship even though it’s just been one date and some texting. Im so incredibly excited to see a text from him, I genuinely enjoy hearing his thoughts about things, his smile is incredible and he seems incredibly sweet. Now the problem is I feel so incredibly anxious while waiting for a text back, I’m scared he’s not going to want a relationship like I am. I feel so vulnerable and I have no idea how to cope with the feelings I have. I feel so incredibly silly with how I’m feeling after just a first date. There is so many what ifs. I know I’m young and if it doesn’t work out it’ll be fine but I feel so scared with how much I am feeling.

I'm a solo dev with a social habit tracking iOS app (**Habit Buddy)**. The idea is you create habits with friends, compete on a leaderboard, snap photos as proof, and set stakes (loser buys coffee). The differentiator from other habit apps is that it's not a solo tracker, it's built around friend groups holding each other accountable. Using friendly competition.

**Where I'm at:**

\- 150 users, entirely organic (word of mouth / app store searches) in 45 days

\- No marketing so far, besides mentioning it on some sideproject sub reddits. The posts didn't do too well

\- Built-in virality: when someone creates a habit and invites a friend, that friend downloads the app to join — so every user that downloads the app usually tells a friend, this helps a lot with growth.

\- People are engaging with the 7 day free trial and converting to Pro ($19.99/yr). This has only been live for 3 days.

\- iOS only right now, hoping to make a few more sales before putting the effort into android.

The invite loop is doing the all the growth right now but I want to increase the traffic.

**Channels I'm considering:**

\- TikTok ads — habit/accountability content does well there, and my demographic is on the platform. But I've never run TikTok ads and don't know if it works for app installs at a small budget

\- Facebook/Instagram ads

\- Reddit — posting in accountability/self-improvement subs is really tricky because of rules around self promotion, but I'd love for people to use my app when looking for accountability partners on reddit. ""Hey looking for someone to joing me on **Habit Buddy** to stay acountable""

\- Influencer partnerships — reaching out to fitness/productivity micro-influencers to try the app with their audience

**My questions:**

1. Which paid channel would you prioritize first with a small budget ($500)?
2. What am I missing in terms of marketing?
3. Has anyone had success marketing a habit/wellness app specifically? What worked?
4. Any creative strategies for leveraging the viral invite loop even more? It's very difficult to set up a ""buy one gift one"" subscription. But I thought a BOGO deal would be nice to have for getting people to invite their friends to the app. People might be more likely to sign up if they can gift to their friends",2,1770757494.0,AskMarketing,6,1.0,False

I’m originally from Minnesota but have been living in Boston/Cambridge for the last 10 years. My partner and I are planning a move to Minneapolis in June for her job. I noticed that there are a number of other Boston transplants in this sub, so I wanted to pose some questions to you especially: my partner and I both have some nerves about the move because we love the energy of our neighborhood in Cambridge. We are paying below-market rent here for a very cute and sunny two bedroom in a safe, quiet neighborhood that is nevertheless very walkable (~8-10 minutes on foot to coffee shops, groceries, great restaurants). We’re about 30 minutes on foot from Harvard square. 

In Minneapolis presently, we’re looking for places around East Isles, Uptown, Kingfield, East Harriet, or the neighborhoods surrounding. We’d like to pay $3,200 or less and are looking for a 2+ bed, 1.5+ bath. We don’t mind (and might even prefer) to live a few minutes off of the busiest thoroughfares, although we are looking at one building near Bde Maka Ska that is just off of Lake Street: any impressions on how busy that area might feel? The building doesn’t have a ton of character, so we are also wondering if it is better to hold out assuming that more options will open up closer to our move date. Our ideal would be to live in a triplex or duplex with plenty of sun on a quiet street but with easy walking to restaurants, groceries, and some kind of green space (10 minutes or less). Is this reasonable to hope for in the areas we’re looking?

And finally, the core question for fellow Boston transplants: how do you feel the energy in the Twin Cities, particularly the areas I’ve mentioned, compares to Boston/Cambridge? In Cambridge, we love that there are always pedestrians in our area who are walking to the T, taking out their dogs, doing their shopping, and stopping in at local restaurants. I’m nervous that I’ll feel more isolated in Minneapolis because it is spread out relative to Boston and because car infrastructure is more robust (and public transit less popular). Businesses in our area are thriving and the parks have tons of people sitting, chatting, and playing. We are two women and never feel unsafe walking in our neighborhood, no matter the time of day. It seems to me that most claims regarding high crime in the cities come from people who feel threatened just by seeing unhoused neighbors or diversity in a neighborhood, so I’m not concerned about many of those reports, but as a gay couple we do want to feel safe out and about holding hands, and I’d like to be able to go most of a year without being catcalled if anyone could speak to that kind of personal security in the Twin Cities. 

Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice you might have! In part, we’re looking for some reassurance. We’re moving largely by necessity and are leaving a lot of things we love behind, including dear friends. We’re hoping we can build a thriving community in Minnesota, too, and have been really moved and heartened by the way people have come together during the horrors of these past few months there, but we are still wondering how that sense of community translates to day-to-day life.

How do I proceed?","I've been with my now-fiancee for a year and was absolutely enamored by everything about her when we first met; how smart, beautiful, sensitive and funny she is/was. We live relatively close to each other, so it was always exciting to see her in the lobby or around the building and I couldn't help but be fascinated by her and how it felt like the universe was conspiring to help us connect. Fast forward to a few months into dating (but not being exclusive,) we go abroad for her birthday and she goes through my phone. I have a text in there from someone who's just a friend \[hadn't responded to said text and didn't plan to, and before that had only checked in on her because she was suicidal, but largely hadn't spoken in a month or so since fiancee and I had met\] but I had asked out long before me and said fiancee had even known the other existed. We never went on the date and decided to just keep it platonic. Fiancee sees this, explodes and turns the rest of the trip into a nightmare. We come back to the States, I try to make it up by getting a nice hotel room to relax and rejuvenate, she goes through my phone again and is angry about texts from before we had even met. That's a whole other debacle - she leaves the room and I have no idea where she goes, but threatens self-harm.

A month or so afterwards, and now in a relationship, I go to my weekly karate class and come home to the box where I keep my journals having been ransacked. She comes downstairs and informs me that ""someone"" had messaged her and said that she needed to check in on a specific friendship I had with someone - so she went through ALL of my journals searching for evidence of this. She had asked about this person previously and out of fear from how she had acted before with people who were just friends, I told her there wasn't history despite there having been briefly. Specifically, this previous fling had occurred on the heels of my father's death, a breakup, losing my job, moving to a new place, and the start of COVID where I was just looking for any kind of connection at that point. She asks to see my phone, which I give to her, and she's convinced I've deleted messages to hide an emotional affair. I can't delete what doesn't exist and instead, there was just conversation about how happy we were in our respective relationships and how we couldn't wait to meet each other's partner. Again, we'd moved on from each other long ago and acknowledged that we had no romantic feelings for each other. I understand it was wrong to hide that history from my partner. End sentence. My then-girlfriend decided to proceed to break things in my apartment, yell, scream and eventually, call the police because I wanted her out of my apartment given that I am significantly larger than her and she could tell people that I had done something to her outside of restraining her from hitting me when she was angry, which I will admit to. The anger and resentment from this goes on for months.

From there on out, every argument turns into flinging things at me about that person (who I had since blocked and ended the friendship with,) insane insults about me being just like my father because I would speak up for myself, and how I was less of a man because I wasn't providing for her financially (I pay for nails, all our dates, vast majority of our international trips, meals, I cook at least 2 meals a day for us, I clean both of our apartments, give her my credit card to get coffee, buy flowers, etc. and to be fair, she brought me the one gift of football tickets for my birthday, but never anything with regularity or consistency) and probably cheating on her because I hadn't gotten a ring for her yet and hadn't proposed yet. At that point, we'd been together for 3 or 4 months. 

Fast forward, the fights keep getting worse. She keeps telling me how I'm not doing enough for her or giving her enough sex, which to be fair, we were having less of it than we first started dating largely in part due to stress, health and work on both ends. She keeps blaming it on the anxiety of not being a fiancee and says things will get better when we're engaged. I propose and quickly find out that was a lie. We're 8 months in at this point. Once we're engaged, it's immediately a continuation of the rhetoric about me not doing enough with arguments almost everyday, but it turns very nasty and she keeps getting violent - a heavy, unbreakable tea cup thrown at me that hits my ankle and leaves a deep bone bruise because I shut her door loudly (it sticks because she has a draft guard under it) and in another argument, kicks a hole in my door. The cops are called again. Finally, on the weekend of my father's death anniversary that she's largely spent starting an argument that ended with my younger brother (who I'm very close to) deciding he didn't want to be involved in my life anymore, I take a stand for myself and realize I shouldn't be being treated this way still despite understanding I had wronged her many months ago. I let her know that I'm extremely angry and will leave her if she doesn't fix things and I start taking financial things and my love away, which immediately makes her change her tune and want to be a better partner - she's suddenly regulating her emotions, being more patient and the like but still bringing up things that were ""subtracted"" because of me being angry with little to no acknowledgement of how we got there except to say that she was ""reacting"" to what I had done long ago.

Finally, we have a coming to God moment after we spent a weekend she got an abortion done arguing as well and reconcile. We apologize to each other, we acknowledge the hurt, but she immediately goes into wanting to talk about finances (me providing rent for both of us, her nails, vacations, dates, etc.) and how I'm going to provide for her again but also makes the conversation largely about how I need to let my feelings go and all of the things I've ""subtracted"" as a result of me being angry because I've been angry for too long (3 days from big fight where I stood up for myself) and it's taking a toll on her because I'm ""mean"" and not ""soft"" towards her anymore. I feel like I had to rush through my feelings when we spent 5 or 6 months sorting through hers, largely just because she didn't want to ""lose"" the benefits of being with me.

While I deeply care for my fiancee, especially as a human being, I'm not sure if she's the person for me anymore but I can't tell if that's a trauma response to what's happened and being made to not feel like enough or if it's generally because we want different things and I don't feel like she's concerned about my wellbeing and future in the slightest. I think I feel like I've constantly been planning for OUR future together while she's more focused on HER present and future. How would you all go about proceeding?

I’m a nurse, and for a long time I was rlly suffering from this nasty BO and BB. I did a lot of things, most did nothing for me, but a few did!!! You can view my other posts on my profile to see how bad it really got for me when I was still struggling! I’ve had to cancel so many plans, turn down so many opportunities, quit a job that I’ve only been at for a month, avoid people in general, and make excuses at work about why I couldn’t make it to work that night when in actuality I was really just reeking of this very nasty room-filling BO! It’s hard when you’re dealing with patients, family members, doctors, and colleagues in a hospital setting where you’re literally breathing down each other’s neck and everyone can smell everyone. Anyway, after so many trials and errors, I finally managed to control my odor! It’s gone by 97% and I’ve been living this odor-free life for 4 months now since Oct 2025! I started taking up new hobbies and started making plans with family/friends again! I no longer have to change multiple scrubs at work! Can you believe I used to bring 4 extra scrubs before???

I used to dread going to work because of all the stares I was getting and all the whispers and nasty comments wherever I went! But now I’m even picking up 2 overtime shifts per week because I finally can!! I don’t have to worry about smelling bad anymore because the odor is technically gone! I’m also able to wear perfume again! I couldn’t do it before because it just made my odor worse! I’ve also started making more friends because I finally feel more confident to be around people again! I’m no longer hiding and I’m proudly taking up space because why wouldn’t I? It’s unreal how life can turn around for us the minute the odor goes away!! No more turning away from opportunities!!

Just know that there is HOPE for us guys! Pls don’t give up on yourself! Always prioritize your mental health and get support by connecting with other sufferers who understand your pain! I was very embarrassed about this condition that I couldn’t even open up about this to anyone. I’ve always thought there’s no more hope for me because I already tried everything. I was washing my skin at work almost every 2 hours to the point where my skin already got sooo dry from overwashing, but I stilled smelled really bad afterwards. I also had to change 2-4x at work it’s crazy! I was already doing too much and nothing was working! But then I overlooked some major suggestions from people on here and on discord who’ve already done their homework, and that was the pivotal point for me and things finally clicked.

You don’t have to fight this battle alone! Join a community where you can bounce off of each other’s ideas and try new things that might work for your specific case! 🫶💕 The name of our discord group is TmauCity if you’re interested in joining. We chat daily and we do group voice calls almost weekly.

EDIT: Things I did that helped eliminate my odor:

\-Low FODMAP diet!

\-Peppermint tea daily for the first 2-3 months to help heal & soothe the gut

\-Avoid for at least 3 months: soy, eggs, gluten, milk, dairy, nuts, and anything w/ high fructose corn syrup … (just let your stomach rest, and once your gut is more healed, you can slowly reintroduce these foods one by one to see if your body still reacts to it negatively… the key is reintroducing in SMALL amount)

\-Avoid chocolates for the first 3 months (most brands contain soy, milk, nuts, dairy, egg, etc. so just avoid them initially!)

\-No more overeating

\-Daily supplement: chlorophyll

\-Occasional supplement: molybdenum & zinc (sometimes magnesium too)

\-I still avoid high-sulfur foods (e.g. cabbage, okra, artichoke, broccoli onion… each one of these has caused me really funky odors so I might just avoid them forever!)

\-I also avoided fish initially for the first 3 months because I wasn’t sure what specific kinds of fish are okay and not okay.. I also avoided all kinds of meat (except for chicken) for the first 3 months. I avoided seafood as well initially.

\-My common go-to food during my initial phase: white rice, rice noodles and anything rice, chicken plainly seasoned in salt and pepper, gluten-free bread, friendly low-fodmap veggies, friendly low-fodmap fruits, friendly salads but i avoided any sauces/dressings for the first 2 months

Just reposting on here what I posted on  r/tmau  as it got deleted 🤷🏻‍♀️ some keywords such as “fecal” odor and “SIBO” are not allowed in that subgroup 😅 Anyway, I hope this post reaches more people who just need proof that it can be done! 💪💕 If you have any question, feel free to ask! Just FYI, I used to have sooo many different odors in the past! Poop, urine, fish, sewer, garbage, rain/grass, cigarette/smoke, burnt rubber, dead animal, rotten egg, sulfur, ammonia, sweet gasoline, vomit, coffee, cement/spoiled coconut etc. Also, my odors have caused other people to sneeze, have itchy and runny noses, they’d rub their noses a lot! It’s like causing them to have nose allergies all of a sudden 😅😅💀 But all these odors are GONE now!

I was angry. Things were rushed. She made some assumptions. She was scared. She said things. I said things. We both got hurt. Things are better between us now, and she's trying to be supportive. But looking back, for my part, I wish I'd done things differently. It was never going to be easy with her, but we might have avoided some of the worst of it.

So now I (44, mtf) am going to take my younger sister (35) out for a cup of coffee and tell her that I'm trans and have been on HRT for 4.5 months. I'm a bit anxious about it. I've tried to think through what to say, how things might go, ways to assure her.

I wanted to post this here because I feel like people here are more likely to have had this conversation as an adult with an adult sibling. I'd love to hear your stories about having ""the trans talk"" with siblings if you'd care to share. Did things go well? Did they go not well? What strategies helped?

(I will add, just because I've had this experience on some subreddits before: if your instinct here is to shame me for not already being fully out to everyone in every area of my life or for worrying how people will react to the news, etc., please just skip this one. I'm working on it. It took me a long damn time to get here, and I'm living a bit more out each day. And family is tricky, darn it, especially when most of your family has a hyper-conservative religious background. I'm just a 44-year-old trans woman sitting here with my weird, achy puberty boobs wondering if I'll be able to keep a good relationship with at least some family members, and I'd really appreciate a bit of advice/comfort/guidance.)",2,1770757124.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

It’s about a three-hour ride each way, and I always book the same seat: window, forward-facing, near the middle of the car. I get motion sick easily, and sitting anywhere else usually means nausea, headaches, or spending half the ride in the bathroom.

This particular day was already rough. I had worked late the night before, slept maybe four hours, and was running purely on coffee and stubbornness. I boarded the train early, put my headphones on, and settled in.

About twenty minutes into the ride, a woman in her late 40s came up to me with a man and a teenage boy behind her. She said, “Excuse me, would you mind switching seats with my son? He gets anxious sitting backward.”

I paused my music and asked where the seat was. She pointed to a backward-facing aisle seat near the bathroom. I politely said, “Sorry, I can’t. I get motion sick.”

She frowned and said, “It’s just for a few hours.”

I told her I specifically booked this seat for a reason. I thought that would be the end of it.

It wasn’t.

She sighed loudly and said, “Wow. He’s a kid.”

The man behind her added, “You don’t look sick.”

I replied calmly, “I don’t need to look sick to be sick.”

They walked away, but about ten minutes later, the woman started loudly talking to another passenger across the aisle about “how selfish people have become” and “how no one has empathy anymore.”

I ignored it.

Then the teenage boy sat down in the seat directly across from me and stared. Not discreetly. Just full-on staring. Every time I looked up, he was watching me. The parents whispered loudly enough for me to hear phrases like “some people think they’re special” and “must be nice to only care about yourself.”

Eventually, another passenger chimed in and said, “Couldn’t you just move? It’s just a seat.”

That’s when I snapped not yelling, but firm.

I said, “I paid for this seat. I have a medical issue. I said no. Please stop harassing me.”

The woman scoffed and said, “Medical issue? Sure.”

At that point, the conductor came by. I explained what was happening. The family tried to say I was being rude and uncooperative. The conductor checked tickets, confirmed my seat assignment, and told them they needed to stop bothering me or move cars.

They left, glaring the entire way.

For the rest of the ride, I could feel people looking at me differently. Like I had committed some unspoken social crime by not sacrificing my comfort for someone else’s child.

When I told my coworker later, she said, “I mean… you could’ve just sucked it up.”

But here’s the thing: I’ve “sucked it up” before. I’ve spent train rides vomiting, dizzy, humiliated, and miserable because I didn’t want to seem rude.

This time, I chose myself.

And apparently, that made me the villain.

1r1cuwt,https://i.redd.it/gy7mbcph7qig1.png,I'm Solo Building an MMORPG to Save 600 Rescue Animals,"Okay, before you bite my head off for the trigger words ""MMORPG"" and ""solo dev"" in the same sentence, hear me out.

My name is Niko. My parents bought a small zoo in Denmark about 30 years ago and converted it into the country's first rescue center for exotic animals. We take in animals that had a hard life, animals from medical testing, cosmetic testing, illegally obtained exotics. People who thought keeping a caracal in their living room was a good idea until it wasn't. We give those animals a home.

About 8 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and we lost him. I moved back home to help my mother run the rescue zoo and care for the 600 animals living here.

Before I moved back I worked as a game developer, started my own company, worked at a game studio, and took part of a software engineering degree. And I had this idea: what if I could build a game that actually helps the animals?

How it started:

My initial idea was to create a community invite-only game where we could have fun together and raise funds for the charity and the rescue animals.

Rescue Wars Online. You're part of the rescue team, you go out on rescue missions, fight evil coffee machine robots, rescue animals, and build your own rescue zoo together with your friends.

Think of it like running your own modded private server for a community, but instead I made my own with a framework where I changed enough to make it ours. I found a solid MMO framework on the Unity asset store (C# client, Java backend) and started bending it into something of our own. At first my skills and the tech weren't there to make it truly custom. My initial idea has always been to make something fun for the community, not something perfect and polished in the first place. Having a world where we could have events, raise funds for the animals, spawn a lot of robots, or go out on fun community-inspired missions together was the goal.

What I've built so far:

* Rescue Missions - Full PvE co-op system. Group up with friends, drop into a mission zone, server generates random objectives. 22 mission areas with progression. You're shutting down Evil Coffee Machine robot power stations and rescuing animals along the way.
* Your Own Rescue Zoo - Private sanctuary instance where you build enclosures, place facilities, and house the animals you rescue. Animals give stat bonuses, enclosures have capacity and upgrades, there's a happiness system. Real gameplay loop: rescue animals, build your zoo, get stronger, take on harder missions.
* 8 Robot Enemy Types - Coffee-machine-themed mobs, each with unique abilities and attack patterns. Grinderjaw ChompBot, Frothblade SpinBot, Mocha MortarBot, you get the idea.
* 4 Classes, Combo Combat, Random Loot - Assault, Tank, Healer, Support. 3-step combo attacks, class abilities, and a random affix system on loot drops.
* Blessing System - Send effects to other players or the whole server. Tied into streaming and community interaction. The idea is that as we raise money for the rescue animals, you could tease me the streamer and do something good at the same time, like donate to the rescue animals and spawn a big evil robot on the stream.

Where we're going:

Right now we're running invite-only servers where a few community members have been invited, and more in the future. Breaking things, figuring out what makes the game fun. When we've got something solid, maybe we open up for more players.

The whole point is to help the rescue animals. Building a fun world for the community while we do something good for the animals is my dream with this project.

I just finished my very first devlog on the project, if you guys would like to see what I'm working on: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYr-Zo7o70A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYr-Zo7o70A)

Happy to answer anything, let me know if you wanna help test!

Best,

1r1ctua,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1r1ctua/alphas_broken_mate_novel_link_in_comments/,Alphas Broken Mate Novel Link In Comments,"[https://storystudio.zatechthing.com/when-shadows-learn-names-aaron-mitchell-1/](https://storystudio.zatechthing.com/when-shadows-learn-names-aaron-mitchell-1/) I can’t say I have dreamed of the day I would meet my mate. Being the last one of my family who wasn’t mated, I have seen how different bonds work. Some are better than others. I have seen my siblings have to fight for their mates and even be separated from them because of different circumstances, so I wasn’t particularly fond of the idea. Still, at the age of twenty-four, I should have found them already. I even thought I would share a mate with my other two brothers since we are triplets, but that wasn’t the case. The walls in my room feel like a prison, so I do what every woman with the ability to teleport would do. I went on another trip to clear my mind. I’ve been everywhere, from the sun-bleached ruins of Greece to the mist-shrouded peaks of the Himalayas. I’ve sipped coffee in a bustling Parisian café at dawn and watched the Northern Lights dance over the frozen silence of the Arctic. The problem is, none of those trips satisfies me anymore. I have gone to other realms as well, but I’m tired of watching my siblings get all cozy with their mates while I’m all alone. I love my nieces and nephews, but I want to be on my own. I considered all the endless possibilities and decided to visit Greece once more. I haven’t been to the smaller, forgotten islands in years—the ones where the only sounds are the cicadas and the sea, and the air smells of wild thyme and dry earth—a place untouched by the frantic energy surrounding my pack. I focus on the memory of a tiny, secluded beach on Ikaria, a place I found by accident a decade ago. The wonderful thing about teleportation is that I can be anywhere without side effects. Everyone in my family can do it, but I’m the best in that area. I land on my feet in soft, sun-warmed sand. The Aegean sun, even in the late afternoon, is a welcome weight on my skin. “This was what I needed,” I mumbled as I stared at the sea. “Hello, Miss,” A woman stood from a lounge chair I hadn’t noticed, shaded by a cluster of bamboo and linen. She was older, her skin weathered by the sun into a map of fine lines, but her smile was warm and immediate. She held a book in one hand, a glass of iced tea perspiring in the other. “A beautiful spot, isn’t it? It rarely has visitors.” I started, my heart giving a frantic leap. Geez, I was so out of it. I should have heard her or at least registered her presence. This proves how much I needed a break. “It is,” I replied. “I’m sorry to intrude. I thought the beach was deserted.” “No intrusion at all, my dear. The sea is for everyone,” she said, her accent a melodic blend of Greek and something else I couldn’t place. Her eyes, a startlingly light blue, crinkled at the corners as she looked me over, not with judgment, but with a deep, unnerving curiosity. “You arrived quite… suddenly. I blinked, and there you were.” Damn it. “Y-yeah,” I stammered as I scratched the back of my head. “People have told me I’m quick on my feet.” I forced a laugh that sounded brittle even to my own ears. Her knowing smile didn’t waver, but she mercifully let my pathetic excuse lie. “Are you staying at one of the villas?” she asked, changing the subject. She gestured with her book toward the cliffs where a few whitewashed buildings were nestled among the greenery. “No, I just arrived,” I said, the truth feeling safer now. “I don’t have a place to stay yet.” “Ah!” Her face lit up. “Then you must try the new lodging in the village. It is not grand, not like the resorts on the other side of the island. But it is clean, the family that runs it is lovely, and the view from the terrace… it will steal the breath from your lungs.” She leaned forward conspiratorially. “And the father makes his own ouzo. A dangerous talent.” It sounded perfect. Simple. Real. Exactly the kind of place I wouldn’t normally look for but suddenly craved. “Thank you. I’ll do that.” I said my goodbyes, my mind already shifting from the strange encounter to the practicalities of finding a room. I focused on the image of a village square she’d inadvertently projected—a small church, a handful of tables under a vine-covered pergola—and teleported. The world dissolved and reassembled in the span of a heartbeat. I stood at the edge of the village plaza, the setting sun casting long shadows across the cobblestones. The air was different here—warm stone, grilling meat, the faint, sweet smell of jasmine. And then, it hit me. A scent. Sharp, clean, and utterly intoxicating—like the zest of a fresh lime sliced open under the Mediterranean sun—it was mixed with something wilder that I couldn’t place. The scent bypassed my brain and went straight to my core, a jolt of pure, undiluted awareness. Thethys, my wolf, suddenly shot to her feet and started growling inside my mind. “Everything okay?” I asked because she was usually silent. I’ve seen how much my siblings speak to their wolves, but mine isn’t like that. She is quieter and reserved, the total opposite of who I am. Thethys kept growling, but she never, not once, answered my question. I sighed in defeat. “I sometimes wonder why you are so damn moody,” I mumbled back. “Can’t you scent that?” She suddenly replied, leaving me dumbfounded. I closed my eyes to track the scent, but for some reason, it was everywhere. I couldn’t pinpoint the origin, which should be easy for me, considering I’m a wolf. “Should we use magic?” I suggested, but she shook her head. “We won’t be able to track him. We don’t have anything of his,” She explained. Hmm… so my mate is a he. I have had my fun here and there, with men and women. I’m not the kind of person who enjoys waiting around, so I thought it would be fun to gain some experience once I met my mate. I didn’t want to go into our first night together completely blind. “Then what do you suggest?” Theia stopped growling and started pacing. She had no idea what we should do, and because of my question, she was now on edge. “Fine,” I muttered under my breath, more to myself than to my agitated wolf. “Forget tracking. Let’s just find this lodging.” The pull of the scent was a constant, maddening hum in my veins, a compass needle spinning wildly because the source was everywhere and nowhere at once. It was infuriating. I was the best teleporter in my family, a master of spatial awareness, and I couldn’t pinpoint the one thing that mattered most. I forced my feet to move, walking away from the main square and deeper into the labyrinth of whitewashed streets. The scent of lime and wildness followed me, a ghost I couldn’t shake. With every step, Thethys’ pacing in my mind grew more frantic, a caged animal sensing its keeper just beyond the bars. “He’s close,” She grunted. “So close…” “You’re not helping,” I shot back silently, my own nerves fraying. I tried to focus on the directions the woman on the beach had given me—look for the blue door with the fishing net, then turn left at the old well. But my attention was fractured, split between navigating the unfamiliar village and resisting the primal urge to stop and just… breathe him in. I found it. The lodging was a charming, two-story building with a deep blue door, just as described. A hand-painted sign swung gently in the evening breeze: ‘Thalassa Rooms’. But as I reached for the wrought-iron handle, the lime scent intensified, sharpening from a general ambiance to a specific, devastating point of origin. It was coming from inside. My hand froze an inch from the door. Thethys went utterly still, a hunter zeroing in on its prey. Here. He is here. The door swung open before I could process the thought, before I could flee. A man stood there, filling the doorway. He was tall, with sun-streaked golden hair and eyes the color of the moon. He held a stack of fresh linen in his arms and smelled of clean cotton, soap, and… lime. The wild, intoxicating lime scent was rolling off him in waves, so potent it was a physical force. Our eyes met. Time stopped. I knew he wasn’t human; the aura surrounding him was too strong. He wasn’t a wolf either, but a supernatural, that was for sure. “Can I help you?” he asked, his voice deeper than I expected, laced with a faint Greek accent that made the simple question sound like a caress. “MATE!” Thethys howled as she wagged her tail. Could he recognize me? What should I do or say? He was my mate. And from the way his eyes widened, the way his grip on the linens tightened until his knuckles turned white, he felt it too. The air between us crackled, thick with unspoken recognition and the overwhelming scent of lime and destiny. “I… I was told you might have a room,” I managed to choke out, my voice barely a whisper. It was a miracle I could form words at all. He just stared at me, his sea-moon eyes wide with a shock that mirrored my own. He opened his mouth, perhaps to answer, perhaps to ask the million questions I saw swirling in his gaze. But then a light and melodic voice floated from inside the house. “Leo? Who is it, agapi mou?” Leo? The name sounds wrong. A woman appeared behind him, sliding her arm through his with a familiar ease that made my blood run cold. She was stunning, with dark curls tumoring over her shoulders and a smile that could launch ships. And there, on the side of her neck, just above her collarbone, was a mark. It was not a mate mark, but a love one. And it smelled of him. “I want to kill her,” Thethys growled. I took a deep breath. He may have his past, just like I have mine. I won’t be such a hypocrite to act like this is the end of the world when he might meet some of the people I have had s\*x back at the pack. The man—Leo—flinched, his gaze darting from me to the woman on his arm, a complicated mix of guilt, panic, and confusion flashing across his face. At least it seems he cares. The woman, oblivious to the cataclysm she had just stepped into, beamed at me. “Hello! Are you looking for a room? We have one left, it’s our best one! The view is incredible.” I couldn’t speak, so I only nodded like an i\*\*\*t. The woman’s smile widened. “Perfect! I am Eleni. This is my friend, Leo. Welcome to Thalassa Rooms.” Friend… So they were in a relationship. “May I ask for your name for your reservation?” Her voice was still sweet, like honey. I couldn’t even get mad at her because she was not being a b\*\*\*h. I wonder what will happen once Leo tells her who I am. “My name is Anika Hills.” “Hills? I have heard that last name,” she mumbled under her breath. I smiled. “My family is rich, that’s why you may have heard of me.” Her eyebrows furrowed as she shook her head. “No, I don’t think that is it.” She turned her head to look at Leo. “You asked me about the Hills family, didn’t you?” My eyebrows shot up. Has he known about me? For how long?",1,1770756769.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I’ve had my Q3 for about two months. I have at least two nagging issues that I haven’t been able to resolve myself. 

First, window management. I’m in my armchair sipping a drink and watching something on the headset. I take the Q off, put it down on the coffee table next to me to do something else, put it back on and windows/apps aren’t anywhere in the position I left them in. I haven’t moved a foot. Is there a fix or a setting? Something to do with the proximity sensor?

2 - I am running QGO and I have a gut feeling that it interferes with power management. I understand it demands more power to do what it does, but does it prevent the set from going into hibernation? My set seems to never go to sleep - green LED 99% on. The app itself does what it says on the tin, but it’s a bit of  a mess with regards to the UX, it’s as if I designed it myself, and say this with all respect to the dev! Am a missing a setting that I turned on during the initial setup somewhere? 

I am a “power” Mac/Linux/Win user and it’s quite embarrassing that I couldn’t find the answers on my own.

Like I'm ready to verbally pop off the minute someone tries to be stupid or annoying.

I feel like I just hate people in general these days and all I can think about is retreating back into a hole where I don't have to deal with them and that worries me.

I had a really bad mental breakdown about a decade or so back due to my bipolar disorder and I've been on medication ever since, I felt centered for the first time in my life, it was amazing. I started working, I had people at my job who liked and respected me and now that same people all probably think I'm a psychopath or something behind my back.

I don't think about hurting people or anything like that, thankfully violence has never entered the picture when I get upset or have an argument with someone.

I lost alot of energy over the years at my job, so I started going to a weight loss clinic where they recommended taking pills and a shot in the arm every month to help with it but I had to stop with those becuase the pills were making me angry. Its now the same thing with coffee, I'm seriously having to think about weaning myself off it to help with my issues because its agitating them if not directly causing them.

I don't know, maybe I need therapy. When I was a kid and having emotional issues, it felt like all my therapists were just an emotionless void that didn't have anything worthwhile to say in feedback, like they didn't care.

Maybe it'll be different as an adult but I make minimum wage and I don't think I have the money to keep cycling through them until I find a good one.

I don't know what this post is supposed to mean, I just needed to vent my brain stuff after a recent verbal altercation with a coworker. I used to be a good person, a sensitive person or I atleast felt like I was..

I'm tired of leaving the house in the morning and going to work and thinking the absolute worst of people over minor infractions. I feel calmer after I get home but feel like I was a different person in public.",2,1770756711.0,Anger,0,1.0,False

[Lelit Bianca v3/Baratza Sette 270wi],"Hi all, my post is about my experience with a new bag of coffee bean and the results I'm getting from it. I've had my equipment for 2 weeks, and with other coffee beans I am able to dial in a nice, pleasant espresso. With this new bag I've never tried before, I'm at a loss for words. So, a little background:

**Equipment**:  
Lelit Bianca v3  
Baratza Sette 270wi

**Bean**:  
Roaster: Jungle (Amazonie)  
Country: Brazil and Columbia  
Variety: Caturra, Castillo, Bourbon rouge, Typica  
Medium roast, dry bean.  
Flavour profile is slightly fruity with chocolate and nut notes

**Prep**:  
18g into my porta-filter (PF)  
WDT for clumps  
Distribution tool (because I have one)  
Tamper w/30lb spring (I have 20 and 25lb springs as well)  
Puck screen

**Machine Prep**:  
93c/200f

**Extraction** **steps**:  
Open valve  
5-6 seconds till coffee appears under the basket  
29s total run  
Excellent tiger striping, good flow rate, no spitting due to channeling in my puck  
\~9.5 bar on the Lelit  
36g yeild (\~+.4g)  
Nice crema  
Slightly watery puck - a tiny bit of water sitting on the screen when I remove the PF.

Now for the taste...*extremely* sour. I know espresso can be ""strong"" in flavour, which usually means it could be bitter or not have any ""sweetness"" similar to a more accessible coffee like perc, but what I'm getting with this particular bag is...shocking to say the least.

I know I can adjust my grind, run long/shorter...but can anyone make suggestions of what could be wrong here? I'll record a video if that would help? The bean is fresh, the bag says it was roasted on Feb 04.  
I am completely new to beans, I have no idea what I want yet, I'm trying to develop my espresso palate, and this bag was recommended by the roaster here in Montreal.

Although the details are not fully clear yet, he did mention that they may want to meet me too, since this company is covering our travel expenses.  *I am not interviewing* for this company, but I'm assuming that I will need to pack some sort of business casual outfit just in case.  I'm still trying to work out the logistics of this outfit and whether or not I will be warm enough.  The company visit would be completely inside.

We're traveling from a warm climate (70 F/21 C).  I realize CT will still be pretty cold in early March.

1r1cn5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1r1cn5j/i_managed_to_reduce_the_number_of_migraines/,I managed to reduce the number of migraines,"I managed to reduce the number of migraines from about 15 per month to 2.

I've had migraines since I was very young, and in 2025 the attacks started to become more frequent.

For a few years I recorded the attacks in a spreadsheet, but I ended up discovering the Migraine Buddy app, which is very helpful in keeping track of sleep, attacks, and medications.

Below is the number of attacks in the last few months:

July 2025: 11,

August 2025: 18,

September: 2025 10,

October 2025: 12,

November 2025: 17,

December 2025: 13,

January 2026: 9,

February 2026: 1.

Over the years I tried to stop drinking coffee, to stop eating certain foods, but I never managed to find a trigger. Now it seems that I have managed to drastically reduce the number of attacks, but I still don't know for sure if it was one action, the combination of them, or something unrelated to that. I started taking 200mg of magnesium on 07/14/2025, and what seems to be the main reason for the reduction is that I started using FL-41 glasses on November 2025. I work all day in an office in front of a computer, and these glasses have brought comfort to my vision. They filter blue light, and in my case, this helps a lot, since the attacks have almost disappeared.

Anyway, I would like to leave this account because migraines are often debilitating, and I would like to help other people.",16,1770756360.0,migraine,3,1.0,False

Tucked into a valley where the fog lingers like a cold breath against the pines, it offers a portrait of rural perfection: white picket fences, a single blinking yellow light at the main intersection, and a silence so heavy it feels deliberate. I moved here six months ago, retreating from a world that had become too loud. I wanted the isolation only a town without a cellular tower could provide. As a newcomer, I cherished the distance, settling into a routine of lukewarm coffee at 9:00 PM and the rhythmic, comforting tick of the grandfather clock in my hallway. It was a life of quiet segments, a sanctuary built on the mundane. But perfection is rarely a natural state, and the first crack appeared not in the town’s infrastructure, but in its timing.

The ""witching hour"" is usually dismissed as a poetic conceit, but there is a physical weight to 3:17 AM that I cannot ignore. It is the moment when sleep is deepest and the psyche is most exposed. The first time I saw it, I had woken to a silence that felt thick, as if the oxygen in my bedroom had suddenly turned to lead. I walked into the hallway and found Mark, my housemate, standing by the window. He wasn't looking at anything; he was just existing in the dark.

As I approached, the moonlight hit his face, and my heart stuttered. Mark was wearing a smile that defied the biological limits of human anatomy. It wasn't an expression of joy; it was a violent, mechanical retraction of skin. His zygomaticus muscles were pulled so taut they looked like white-hot wires beneath his cheeks, stretching his lips back until his gums were dry and his teeth were fully bared. His skin had turned a translucent, bloodless white under the strain. It was the ""uncanny valley"" brought to life—a seizure of the persona that triggered a primal, lizard-brain scream in my head. That is not Mark, my mind whispered. That is a thing wearing Mark’s face. He didn't blink. He didn't breathe. He just held that jagged, frozen crescent until the clock chimed 3:18 AM. Then, his face simply... collapsed. He turned, asked if I wanted tea, and walked into the kitchen as if the last sixty seconds had never happened.

I spent the next week trying to convince myself I was losing my mind, but the precision was too consistent to be a hallucination. I began to watch from the shadows of my porch, documenting the town with the frantic energy of a man trying to prove he isn't a ghost.

\\\* Night 4: The Grocery Store Clerk: I peered through the glass of the 24-hour express mart. At 3:16:59 AM, the clerk was mid-sentence, talking to a stray customer. At 3:17:00 AM, both of them snapped their heads toward the ceiling. Their mouths peeled back in unison, exposing rows of teeth in the harsh fluorescent light. They stood like statues for exactly sixty seconds, their bodies vibrating with an intense, suppressed energy.

\\\* Night 7: The Police Patrol: A cruiser slowed to a crawl outside my house. I saw the officer’s silhouette. As the clock turned, his head didn't just move; it swiveled with a wet, audible click toward my window. He stared at me through the glass, his smile so wide it looked as though his jaw might unhinge.

The temporal gaslighting was the hardest part to endure. At 3:18:00 AM, the world simply resumed. No one wiped the sweat from their brow; no one massaged their aching jaws. The transition was seamless, a film strip spliced so perfectly you’d only know the cut was there if you were looking for the blood.

I tried to break the silence at Miller’s Diner. The sun was out, the coffee was hot, and the town was its usual, helpful self. I waited until Sarah, the waitress I’d grown to like, was refilling my cup.

""Do you ever feel... restless?"" I asked, my voice cracking. ""Around 3:17 in the morning? Like the whole town is holding its breath?""

The clatter of silverware stopped. Every head in the diner turned toward me—not with the smile, but with a flat, predatory neutrality. Sarah’s hand stayed perfectly still, the coffee pot hovering inches from my cup.

""The mountain air can be heavy for outsiders,"" she said. Her voice was polite, but her eyes were as cold as a shallow grave. ""Some folks find it’s best to keep their mouths closed until they’re used to the pressure. It’s for your own health, dear. You wouldn’t want to strain anything.""

The ""polite"" threat hung in the air like a noose. The prosperity of Oakhaven—the lack of crime, the lush gardens, the uncanny peace—wasn't a blessing; it was a transaction. I found the receipt later that day under a loose floorboard in my pantry. It was a note from the previous tenant, the handwriting frantic and jagged: “It’s not them smiling. Something is pulling the strings from the inside. If you don't join the chorus, they'll make you the instrument.”

Last night, I decided to become a defect in the machinery. At 3:15 AM, I walked into the town square. The air was unnervingly still. When 3:17 AM struck, I didn't hide. I stood in the center of the plaza, my face slack, my lips pressed firmly together.

The reaction was a physical assault. Every person within eyeshot—the night janitor, a lone driver, a woman walking her dog—stopped. Their heads turned in a singular, fluid motion toward me. I heard it then: the collective, rhythmic click-click-click of twenty necks rotating in perfect unison. They didn't just look; they beckoned. A low-frequency hum rose from beneath the pavement, a vibration that resonated in my marrow, making my teeth ache. The ""Deep Smile"" wasn't a ritual. It was a mask for a presence beneath the very geography of the town, something that required a moment of total, synchronized surrender every night to remain fed. Their eyes weren't looking at me—they were looking through me, inviting the thing underneath to see the one who refused to bow.

I ran. I am writing this now from my basement, the door bolted, the heavy thud of footsteps echoing on the floorboards above. I can hear Mark up there. He isn't walking; he’s dragging something.

I am documenting this here because digital folklore is the only medium that survives when the physical record is erased. If you find a place that feels too perfect, where the peace feels choreographed, do not look at the clock. The horror isn't what happens at 3:17 AM; it’s what happens when the town decides you're a part of the choreography whether you want to be or not.

My jaw is starting to throb. My facial muscles are twitching, pulling upward with a force that feels like fishhooks buried in my cheeks. There is a sickening pressure behind my ears, and the sound of my own teeth grinding together is the only thing I can hear over that low, rhythmic hum coming from the floor. My skin is stretching, tearing at the corners of my mouth. I’m trying to hold my lips shut, but the bone is pushing through. I am losing the battle to keep my face my own.

3:16 AM.

The pressure is unbearable. My mouth is opening. I can feel the smile coming, and this time, I don’t think I’ll ever be allowed to let go.

3:17 AM.

It reads 5 am. I get out of bed and put my work clothes on, I only have two outfits; work and casual. I head down stairs to the kitchen to get started on breakfast. But first I make myself a cup of coffee and step out on the patio. It’s dark and quiet, no one wakes up this early. This is the only peace I have all day, and I cherish it. After I finish my cup I head inside and start making breakfast for everyone. I live in the Alpha house, only the alpha family lives here. The Alpha’s my father. My mother and father live here along with my two older brothers. Even though I’m family, I am treated like an omega. My ‘room’ is a closet. I cook for everyone, and I clean constantly, and I’m not allowed out of the house. I want to finish breakfast before anyone comes down. It’s the best way to avoid confrontations. I make stacks and stacks of pancakes. My brothers are 27 and 25. They’re both warriors. They eat A LOT. I cook sausage and bacon as well, and just to make sure there is enough I also bake some blueberry muffins. As I finish making breakfast and cleaning up, I start to hear movement from upstairs. I race to set the table and make my way down to the basement to start on the laundry. I try my best to make sure I am out of their way. In the basement I hear them make their way down stairs and start eating. I feel a bit relieved, today might not be so bad. I know my father has a meeting with an Alpha from another pack today and he’ll probably be busy with that for most of the day. About an hour later, I am folding clothes in the laundry room when I smell it, that rank smell of lust and I know immediately who’s behind me. I turn around to see Beta Yuri standing in the door way. He pushes himself against me and takes my throat in his hand. “You trying to avoid me Cat?” He spits into my ear. I shake my head nervously. He grips tighter and takes a big sniff of my hair. I can feel him growing excited against me. “Mmm, I don’t have time to f\*\*\* you right now. But I’ll have you tonight.” He grips tighter against my throat, his free hand glides behind my waist and grabs my a\*\*. “Do you understand?” He asks. I can only nod my head. He releases me and steps back. I gasp for air and grab my throat. He straightens his clothes and hair before heading back upstairs. “Bring a tray of coffee and muffins to your father’s office in one hour. I don’t want you in there when the other Alpha arrives.” He yells over his shoulder on his way up the stairs. About 30 mins later, when I’m sure they have left the dinning room, I head upstairs to clear the table and prepare the tray. When I finish I bring the tray to my fathers office and knock. “Come in.” He yells. I take a deep breath and enter. Both my father and Beta Yuri are sitting in the office. I try to hurry and leave the tray but as I turn to leave Beta Yuri says, “Cat, come over here.” I slowly walk over to the side of the couch. He looks up at me and a smile curls across his face. “Sit on my lap Cat, I’ve missed you.” I hesitate but he grabs my hips and pulls me into his lap. I don’t pull away because I know it’s no use. My father doesn’t look up from his work, but I know he knows what’s going on. Beta Yuri buries his face in my neck and sniffs. He whispers in my ear, “I am looking forward to tonight. Maybe there’s time to play time before the meeting?” He slides his hand over my shirt, but before he can really do anything we hear movement outside the door. He groans, “Looks like we will have to wait until tonight, they’re early.” He says with a sigh and shoves me off of him. I take a few steps away from the couch to put some distance between us. I am standing next to my fathers desk when he walks in. Drew’s POV My alarm goes off at 4 am. I get up, put on some work out clothes and head to the gym, good thing it’s only down the hallway. I live in my pack house. Its a 12 story condo-like building. Everyone in the pack lives here. The top floor is all mine. I’m the Alpha. I need a work out before I go to this meeting today. Alpha Samson and his pack have always bothered me. He is unnecessarily cruel and ruthless. I’m just glad his pack is small and not very successful or else he’d be a threat to many. I jump on the treadmill and look over the notes for the meeting today. After an hour, I get off and head back to my room for a shower. I’m in there for maybe 5 minutes, then I hop out and get ready to go. I make my way down to the first floor where my beta Murphy meets me. “Morning Alpha.” Murphy says with a smile. Murthy’s always smiling. I’ve always thought he was too jolly for his own good. “Morning Murph, did you read over the meeting notes?” “Of course I did. Don’t worry, they NEED our help. I don’t think we have anything to worry about.” Murphy says while slapping his hand on my back. Murphy has been my best friend since we were pups. His father was my father’s beta and best friend. We head out the front door and get into the car waiting for us. “Even though this is going to be an easy meeting, I am not looking forward to it.” Murphy admits. I raise my eyebrow at him. “Alpha Samson always rubs me the wrong way. He’s just.. slimy.” Murphy gives a face and shivers. “I know what you mean Murph, but we could use the land they own here.” I say as we arrive to the airport. We make our way to our private jet and prepare for the 2 and a half hour flight. We land ahead of schedule and head for the Blood Forest Pack. We’re a bit earlier than planned, but I’m eager to get this over with. Blood Forest Pack isn’t a big pack, but they have a lot of land spread out all across the country. We’re trying to acquire a plot they own right next to our pack lands. We want to build a new training facility. We pull up to the Alpha Samson’s house about 10 minutes earlier than anticipated. “Should we wait?” Murphy asks as he looks out the window at the decently sized home in the middle of the woods. “Let’s just get this over with.” I say as I open my door. It’s quiet outside, although I can hear the distant sounds of warriors training. We make it up to the door and before we can knock, it’s opened by Luna Mary, Alpha Samson’s mate. She is all smiles, “Welcome Alpha Andrew and Beta Murphy. What a pleasure to have you both here.” She opens the door wide to let us come in. “I know we are a bit early Luna Mary, I hope that won’t be a problem?” I ask. “Not at all Alpha Andrew. I believe Alpha Samson is in his office already. Please follow me, right this way.” She smiles and leads us up the stairs. The home is very open and the stairs lead to 4 doors, all visible from down stairs. We stop in front of the second door, where she knocks and opens the door. As we enter the room I see the Beta sitting on the couch, Alpha Samson sitting at his desk.. … wait… What is that smell? “Mate!” Mark, my wolf, growls. I see a girl standing by the Alpha. She is about 5’6, with auburn hair pulled back in a ponytail She’s dressed like a worker. Is she an omega? She looks nervous. She’s just staring at the floor, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Am I sure she is my mate? “Yes, she is. And she is not an omega.” Mark growls. “Leave Cat.” Alpha Samson whispers and she turns to go. “Wait!” I exclaim. I can see Murphy turn to look at me out of the corner of my eye. “Mate.” I mindlink Murphy. Alpha Samson, Luna and his Beta are all looking at me confused. I walk over to her and place my hand under her chin. She winces. I lift her head and her blue eyes meet mine. “Mate.” I say. She only holds my eyes for a moment before shifting her eyes back to the ground. I felt a ping in my heart, was that rejection? “Leave now! Cat!” Alpha Samson shouts angrily, taking my attention. He does not look happy, but his Luna looks very pleased. Cat leaves the room and I turn to face the Alpha Samson and Luna Mary. Alpha Samson hisses, “Who do you think you are coming in here and claiming my daughter for yourself. She is..” Luna interrupts, “Now now dear, you know the mate bond is not a choice” she says with a smile, “Alpha Andrew and Beta Murphy would you mind giving me and the Alpha a moment in private?” I nod to her and step out of the room. “Is she really your mate man?” Murphy whispers. “Yes, I’m sure of it, but it felt one sided. Maybe she’s not of age yet?” I hear sharp whispers behind the door, a loud bang, and then silence. Beta Yuri storms out of the room and down the hall. I look over to Murphy and he has a confused look. When the door opens, the Luna is smiling and invites us back in where Alpha Samson is waiting. “Alpha Andrew, thank you for your patience. Why don’t we have our meeting first and then we shall discuss the matter of my daughter.” he suggests. I nod and Murphy and I take a seat. The meeting is pretty successful. We come to an agreement on the land and the contracts are drawn up. Once the official meeting concludes, I become anxious about my mate. Alpha Samson turns to his Luna, “My dear, would you mind stepping out for a moment while I speak with Alpha Andrew about Catalina?” She gives him a pointed look, “Of course dear. I’ll grab us some celebratory drinks.” and she leaves the room. Alpha Samson stands up and walks around the desk. He sits on it’s side. He’s an older man, probably in his early 50s but it’s hard to be sure. Weres age slower than most. “So Catalina is your mate. And I’m guessing you would like her to go with you back to your pack.” Alpha Samson looks directly at me. I can see the rage in his eyes and my own is growing inside me. “What will you give me for her?” He hisses. Shock. Total and utter shock flows through me. “What?” Murphy asks. Alpha leans back and relaxes his face, “ It’s simple, I have something you want. So what do you have that I want? It’s Business.” Alpha gets up from the desk and walks back around to his chair. He is completely serious. He’s going to sell his daughter. What kind of man is this? “What do you want Alpha Samson?” I ask coldly. “Hmm, well you are taking one of my best workers. I’m going to need some compensation so I can hire someone new.” He says with a grin. “He’s selling his daughter.” Murphy mind links me. I can feel the disgust in his voice. “How much Alpha Samson?” I ask with a straight face. “$1,000,000” Alpha replies. Murphy stands, “What?!” I can tell he’s had enough of this. I keep my eyes on Alpha Samson as his smile widens. “Agreed. But she comes with us now.” I say as I stand. Alpha Samson stands and shakes my hand. “Are you really going to pay that money for your own mate?” Murphy mind links me. “ I have a feeling I need to get her away from this man as soon as possible.” I tell him back. At that moment, the Luna walks in with drinks and a smile. “ So we have an agreement?” She asks with a smile. That’s when I realize they both planned this.

I’m a 54-year-old neurodivergent guy in Toronto’s east end looking to meet new people and build genuine, low-pressure friendships.

I want to be upfront: I’m not here for a quickie. I know that can be common on Reddit, but I’m posting because I’m honestly looking for real connection – good conversation, shared interests, and people to actually hang out with. Think low-key Netflix or Crunchyroll marathons, coffee chats, or just relaxed time together. For me, any kind of real intimacy starts with face-to-face connection and getting to know someone as a person.

Age-gap friendly:

I’ve always connected well with people of different ages and backgrounds. Younger, older – it doesn’t matter to me. Good energy, kindness, and mutual respect mean way more than a number. I connect with the person, not their age, gender, culture, or beliefs.

What I’m hoping to find:

Someone to do normal, everyday stuff with – coffee, walks, exploring neighborhoods, random local events, thrift store wandering, food adventures, board games, museums, or just hanging out and talking about life. Nothing intense, just easygoing company and organic connection.

About me:

Indigenous & Pagan

Open-minded and poly-friendly

Neurodivergent (comfortable if you are too)

A little nerdy, a little creative

Life kept me busy for a long time, and I’ve realized my social circle has gotten smaller than I’d like. I’m at a point where I’d really enjoy meeting new people and getting out more.

If you like relaxed vibes, real conversations, and simple shared adventures with no pressure, feel free to send a message and tell me a bit about yourself.

1r1chzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1r1chzy/fired_from_fulcrum_coffee_after_noticing_an_owner/,Fired from Fulcrum Coffee after noticing an owner followed MAGA figures,"A couple weeks ago, when a lot of businesses were closing or donating in solidarity with Minneapolis, I started noticing which companies were staying quiet. One of those was my employer at the time, Fulcrum Cafe.

I did some digging and saw that one of the owners, Brian Jurus, was following a bunch of MAGA/right-wing figures on Instagram (Charlie Kirk, Karoline Leavitt, Kristi Noem, etc.). I don’t really believe in businesses staying “neutral” and hoping nobody looks too closely, so they can continue to get business.

I messaged another coffee shop in town, Bonito, to share what I found. A few days earlier I had learned they buy wholesale from Fulcrum. Bonito brands itself as Latino-based, “for the community” (which I’m part of as a first-gen Mexican-American), and very vocally FUCK ICE, so I honestly thought they’d want to know.

They sent back a pretty cold DM telling me I should take it to Fulcrum management. I didn’t. I knew how that would go.

I was fired the next week. Brian’s Instagram was gone the day after I messaged Bonito.

Just a reminder that not every business that looks “progressive” online actually has your back. And businesses will almost always protect other businesses.



Edit: I think some people are missing the point. Bonito positions themselves as allies to the Latino community, and I knew them on a level where I would frequent their space, so I genuinely thought it was a safe space to share info about their supplier. Clearly, it wasn’t.

At this point, it feels like “Latino-owned” is just branding. There were many ways this could’ve been handled without my name ever being brought up. I knew I was taking a risk. I took it in good faith, with people from the same community as me.

**TLDR:**  
I was fired from Fulcrum after privately sharing that one of their owners follows MAGA/right-wing figures with another cafe that brands itself as Latino-owned and anti-ICE. They gave me a cold response. Fulcrum found out. I was fired a week later.",750,1770756043.0,Seattle,166,0.85,False
1r1chtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1r1chtu/how_to_make_someone_like_you_the_psychology/,How to Make Someone Like You: The Psychology Everyone Gets Wrong,"Look, we've all been there. You meet someone new, maybe it's a date, a potential friend, a job interview, or just someone you want to vibe with, and you're silently freaking out thinking, ""Please like me, please like me."" And here's what most people get dead wrong: They think it's about being impressive. It's not. 



After falling down a research rabbit hole (books, psychology studies, podcasts with social dynamics experts), I realized we've been approaching this backward. The real secret? It's not about making yourself likable. It's about making the OTHER person feel good around you. Sounds simple, but stick with me because the psychology behind this is wild.



 Step 1: Stop Trying to Impress, Start Being Interested



Here's the first truth bomb: People don't like you because you're smart, successful, or funny. They like you because of how you make them FEEL. And the fastest way to make someone feel good? Show genuine interest in them.



Ask questions that go deeper than surface level BS. Instead of ""What do you do?"" try ""What's something you're excited about right now?"" Instead of nodding along, actually listen. Like, really listen. Put your phone away, make eye contact, ask follow up questions.



There's this concept from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People (yeah, it's from 1936 but this stuff is timeless). Carnegie found that people who show genuine interest in others are exponentially more likable than those trying to be interesting themselves. It's counterintuitive but it works because everyone's favorite subject is themselves.



The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane backs this up with neuroscience. When someone feels heard and understood, their brain releases oxytocin (the bonding chemical). You're literally creating a chemical reaction that makes them associate you with good feelings.



 Step 2: Mirror Without Being Weird About It



This is some next level stuff. Subtle mirroring of body language, speech patterns, and energy creates instant rapport. When someone leans in, you lean in. When they speak slower, you slow down. When they use certain words or phrases, you naturally incorporate them.



This isn't about being fake. It's about creating harmony. We're biologically wired to like people similar to us (it's an evolutionary thing about tribe safety). Mirroring sends subconscious signals that say ""we're on the same wavelength.""



But here's the key: SUBTLE. Don't be a creepy copycat. Just match their general vibe and energy level. If they're chill and soft spoken, don't come in hot with loud energy. If they're animated and excited, match that enthusiasm.



 Step 3: Use Their Name (But Not Like a Salesperson)



There's psychological research showing that hearing our own name activates specific parts of our brain tied to attention and emotional processing. When you use someone's name in conversation, it creates a small dopamine hit.



But don't overdo it like some corporate training video. Use it naturally. ""Sarah, that's such a good point"" or ""What do you think, Marcus?"" Sprinkle it in, don't spam it.



 Step 4: Validate Without Kissing Ass



There's a difference between validation and fake compliments. Validation is acknowledging someone's perspective, feelings, or experiences. It's saying ""That makes total sense"" or ""I can see why you'd feel that way"" even if you don't necessarily agree.



Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg breaks this down beautifully. When people feel validated, their nervous system literally relaxes. They drop their defenses. Suddenly they're more open, more authentic, more willing to connect.



This doesn't mean agreeing with everything someone says. It means making them feel heard and understood. That's what creates real connection.



 Step 5: Be Vulnerable (Just a Little Bit)



Most people think they need to seem perfect to be likable. Wrong. Research from Brené Brown (check out her book Daring Greatly) shows that vulnerability actually increases likability. When you share something real, something imperfect, it gives others permission to be real too.



This doesn't mean trauma dumping on someone you just met. But sharing a small struggle, admitting you don't know something, or being honest about a mistake makes you human. And humans connect with humans, not polished facades.



There's even a psychological principle called the Pratfall Effect. Studies show that highly competent people become MORE likable when they make minor mistakes or show vulnerability. It makes them relatable.



 Step 6: Positive Association (The Sneaky Brain Hack)



Your brain is lazy and makes shortcuts called associations. If someone meets you while they're having a good time, their brain links you with those positive feelings. This is why first dates at fun activities work better than boring coffee shops.



Create positive experiences. Make people laugh. Share something interesting. Take them somewhere they enjoy. Their brain will literally start associating you with good vibes, even if you're not directly causing all the positivity.



If you want to go deeper into social psychology without spending hours reading through dense research, BeFreed is an AI learning app that pulls from sources like these books, expert interviews, and psychology studies to create personalized audio lessons. You can set a goal like ""become more magnetic in conversations"" and it builds a structured learning plan based on your personality and specific struggles. The depth is adjustable, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you get a virtual coach you can chat with about your unique challenges. It connects the dots between all these concepts way faster than piecing together random articles and books.



One technique: Always end interactions on a high note. Leave when things are good, not when the conversation dies. Their last memory of you becomes the dominant impression.



 Step 7: Match Energy, Don't Force It



Energy matching is different from mirroring. This is about respecting someone's current emotional state. If someone's stressed or tired, don't come in with hyperactive energy demanding attention. Meet them where they're at.



This shows emotional intelligence, which according to Daniel Goleman's research is one of the biggest predictors of likability and social success. People like those who ""get"" them emotionally.



 Step 8: The Power of Small Favors (Ben Franklin Effect)



Here's a mind bending one: The Ben Franklin Effect shows that when someone does YOU a small favor, they actually like you MORE afterward. Sounds backward, right?



It works because humans need cognitive consistency. If someone helped you, their brain rationalizes ""I must like this person, otherwise why would I help them?"" So don't be afraid to ask for small, reasonable favors. ""Could you recommend a good restaurant?"" or ""Mind if I grab your opinion on something?""



Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in her book Captivate. Small requests create investment, and investment creates connection.



 Step 9: Remember Details, Bring Them Up Later



This is stupidly simple but insanely effective. When someone mentions their dog, their upcoming trip, or their favorite band, remember it. Then bring it up next time. ""How was that concert you were excited about?"" or ""How's your dog doing?""



This signals that you actually paid attention. It shows they matter. And feeling like you matter to someone is one of the fastest paths to liking them.



Use your phone notes if you have to. Seriously. I keep a running note of details about people I meet. It's not creepy, it's considerate.



 Step 10: Be Genuinely Happy for Their Wins



Jealousy and comparison kill likability. When someone shares good news, your reaction matters. The best response? Active Constructive Responding (from positive psychology research). Don't just say ""That's cool."" Get genuinely excited. Ask questions. Celebrate with them.



When people feel like you're rooting for them, they gravitate toward you. Competition and one upping pushes people away. Support pulls them closer.



 The Real Secret Nobody Tells You



Here's what I learned after obsessively researching this: The people everyone likes aren't the loudest, prettiest, or most successful. They're the ones who make others feel seen, heard, and valued. That's it. That's the whole game.



Stop performing. Start connecting. The irony is that when you stop trying so hard to be liked and start focusing on making others feel good, you become magnetic without",2,1770756032.0,SocialBlueprint,0,0.75,False

A bit of a geek, recently finished Hades 2 (well, rolled credits) and had a great time with it! I'm a pretty avid reader, and quite enjoy theatre, so a show with someone new would be very fun! Really enjoy musicals and comedies, and good mucial improv lol. 😅

Do a fair bit of walking and trying to get back into the gym, so a gym buddy wouldn't go amiss for the motivation, or would be up for some bouldering if you'd enjoy that!

I'm about 5'7, with short brown hair and glasses. I'm more than happy to send a face pic early on. I'm pretty flexible in terms of what I'm looking for. If I hit it off with the right person, then ideally looking for something serious, but I'm open to something more casual as well, depending on how things go.

I do quite like tattoos and piercings, so bonus points if you have any, but definitely not required. (Possible scope for a visit to the Scottish Tattoo convention next month maybe?) Definitely not a red line though, I think it's more important to have a chat and see if there's any chemistry than anything else, so feel free to message if you think we might vibe no matter what!

Please be willing to meet up in person at some point. It doesn't have to be right away, but I'm not looking for something online, and meeting in person is important to me. Your first win at minigolf is nearly guaranteed, or more than happy to just grab a coffee and have a chat! 🥳

I'd love to have a chat if you'd be interested in seeing how we get on! If you've played it, why not let me know who your pick was in Baldurs Date 3? I promise I'll only judge you a little! 😉",1,1770755741.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Where to start?,"Working with a restaurant owner who is retiring and wants to sell. We recently sold a gelato/coffee shop for $100k in Brooklyn. However, we already had a buyer when we started with the listing. I've listed on Crexi and am surfing around Reddit. Any advise on what platforms get the most attention for restaurant sales? I think $125k sounds reasonable. Thoughts on that?",3,1770755726.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False
1r1cciw,https://v.redd.it/uhyn9yuj6qig1,The Inn by the Sea.,"So this is a 6m walkthrough of my house in our Guild Neighbourhood so far. I picked plot  36 on Alliance side so it looks out onto the sea. My Kul'Tiran Surival hunter has retired here to become an inkeep. I've made a lobby, a kitchen/restaurant, a tavern and my own Pandaria inspired quarters. Upstairs leads to the Sentinel and Rose Coffee Shoppe/Lounge and the next phase will be three rooms going off from it. I am super proud of this. ",6,1770755707.0,WoWHousing,1,1.0,False
