Originally posted in r/Austin but moved it to this subreddit as per the mods.

I’ve been to Sour Duck multiple times and have always enjoyed stopping in for a cold brew coffee. But today I decided I’d try ordering an Orange Juice to go… and boy was I surprised at what I got for $5. I wasnt expecting a huge cup of orange juice or anything like that but a small shot of orange juice for $5 just feels ridiculous. Needless to say I’ll be sticking to their cold brew lol. Just wanted to share and give others a heads up in case they feel like ordering an orange juice to go.",1,1757866227.0,austinfood,0,1.0,False
1ngv991,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1ngv991/help_with_6day_costa_rica_itinerary_late_october/,Help with 6-Day Costa Rica Itinerary (Late October),"Hi everyone!
We’re a group of 3 traveling to Costa Rica at the end of October and only have 6 full days. I’d love some feedback or suggestions to make the most of our time.

Current plan:
	•	Day 1–2: La Paz, La Fortuna / Arenal
	•	Day 3–4: Puerto Viejo, Cahuita NP
	•	Day 5: Drive to Central Valley (Sarapiquí?)
	•	Day 6: Arrive in San José, get ready for early flight next day

I’ve heard about cool spots in the Central Valley for coffee/cacao tours, crocodiles, and rafting (though we’ll probably skip rafting).

Questions:
	•	Would you recommend alternative stops instead of Sarapiquí?
	•	Should we spend more time in La Fortuna instead?
	•	Any must-do tours or hidden gems you’d suggest given our short trip?

Thanks so much for any tips!

So I'll start off with. I am a married woman with three children aged just under two, 10 and 8. I have been married for 13 years with my husband for 15. I got married at 23 so younger by traditional standards I guess. 

We had such a great sex life when we were engaged and newly married. It definitely took a hit once we had kids. 

My husband absolutely hates kissing, other than little pecs I have not been kissed pretty much since we got married. He also hasn't performed any kind of oral since you're one of our marriage, I brought it up to him multiple times. He just says it's not something he likes doing or he's interested in doing. Even though he did it when we were dating/ engaged/ married. And then he keeps moving the goal post saying if I do this maybe he'll feel like it... almost like he's not attracted enough to do it. I don't know. It's really messing with me to be honest. I think I've just been really burying. How much those two things really bother me because prior to him I've always been super affectionate. All of my ex's we were very big kissers. I love it like LOVE kissing and he is just so uninterested that it almost feels awkward if he tries to kiss me now. 

Anyways, fast forward to the past 2 years. I've always been the instigator for any sexual activity. I just feel like it is literally non-existent. Unless I make the move, and since we've had our youngest, it's definitely taking a little bit of a hit to my ego because I didn't bounce back as quickly. Now I'm only about 5 lb away from my pre-baby weight and I am objectively a pretty woman. So there's no issues in that sense, however, he is just not instigating and if he does it's very rare. 

I did try to spice it up, Wear lingerie, give him random BJs, sent him flirty texts but but when you're just getting zero effort in on the other side it just sucks. So to be honest I just stopped trying..

We have sex maybe once every 1-2 month. Maybe 2 minutes just enough for him to get off and then nothing for me. He's always been a selfish lover so maybe it didn't bother me so much prior because we were having sex more frequently.

I know this is the last piece that I feel like I do everything at home, he works very hard. I will give him that However, He works for himself and traditionally makes his own schedule and him working 7 days a week from 7:30 coming back from a few hours, eating dinner then leaving again to go to the gym and coming back after a bedtime. Seems a little much. I know many of those hours are spent at coffee shops, listening to podcasts while I'm at home alone or with the kids. I also own a business, help him with his business while I also handle everything at home including all the childcare, cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping and literally EVERYTHING he hasn't done dishes, made a meal, folded laundry EVER. And all I really want for him is to take maybe a little bit off my plate and make me feel wanted.

This whole thing is really starting to cause issues for me, because it's affecting my self-confidence and making me resent him. I just don't want to live my next 40 years surviving off of crumbs of love and affection.

I brought up marriage counseling in the past and out of the solid no for him. I feel like I am really thinking about leaving.",1,1757866125.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

So, I gave it a shot! Here’s what I’d eat if I were to do it:

**Breakfast – Breakfast Casserole with Coffee (407cal | 41P | 39C | 10F)**
• 150g potatoes
• 100g 3-pepper & onion mix
• 15g sliced black olives
• 60g ham slices
• 150g egg whites
• 10g low-calorie, high-protein cheese
• 75g plain Greek yogurt
• 20g light mayonnaise
• 125ml unsweetened cashew milk + 1 sweetener (for the coffee)

**Lunch – Stuffed Bell Pepper (300cal | 29P | 34C | 7F)**
• 1 green bell pepper
• 15g jasmine rice (dry)
• 60g extra-lean ground turkey
• 1 cube concentrated chicken bouillon
• 50g zucchini
• 132g canned diced tomatoes
• 85g 1% cottage cheese
• 15g low-calorie, high-protein cheese

**Dinner – Fajitas (474cal | 51P | 65C | 14F)**
• 150g chicken breast
• 100g 3-pepper & onion mix
• 1/3 packet fajita seasoning
• 2 low-carb tortillas
• 20g low-calorie, high-protein cheese
• 60g salsa

**Snacks – One peach (63cal | 1P | 15C | 0.4F)**

**Dessert – Fluffy Jello (46cal | 7P | 4C | 0F)**
• 1/4 packet sugar-free Jello mix
• 1/2 cup water
• 62g Greek yogurt

Macros may vary depending on the specific ingredients used. Personally, I think this is totally doable for a day of eating. The tricky part was trying to increase fats while still hitting the 1200-calorie target and staying within 0.7g–1g of protein per pound (I’m 150lbs).

As a woman, it’s important to have enough fats for healthy hormone function. That’s why I prefer eating more calories overall, so I can hit at least 50g of fats and 150g of protein. Still, this was a fun little challenge to put together 🤗",1,1757866105.0,1200isplenty,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to do a video series on how easy/difficult it would be to do those activities by another means of transportation, and the pros/cons of doing so.

The common symptom for me is - 2-3. hours after the lunch, when my stomach feels like it has been empty’d out. I get reaĺy bloated and feel like I need to go to the toilet (I usually go in the morning and after lunch), but when I go, nothing happens. So Im just stuck in this bloated state and usually it does not get better till I eat a snack, or lately a dinner. After that Im again ok. Then repeat.

(if you want to read a longer story of my problem and maybe have some usefull tips from your experience, I would be very honored):
I do not even know, if I have IBS, Im waiting for gastroenterology appointment next month.. before this symptom started showing up, it was even worse, I was much more constipated and I self medicated it with laxatives. Now I take psyllium and it helps. 
Im now week in trying coffee, dairy and gluten free diet, and I avoid most high fodmap foods, except cooked pears and thats all. Does not really look like it started helping. But maybe too soon to expect results.
Im moving a lot, doing manual work. I eat healthy and nowadays more digestable foods. Vegetables usually cooked. Not much raw food in general.
Im thinkg about it all the time, when the symptoms show up and Im just overwhelmed with ideas what could cause it, what I need to change and just feel hopeless, that it wont get better.

Im trying to be gratefull, that I still can function normally, but it is so annoying and I want to get rid of this.

Thanks for any response, and I hope everyone of us in this sub will find a way to fight their digestive issues and feel better.",1,1757865847.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

How do we tell them? When we are estranged?","My in laws caused my wedding to get canceled and now I’m pregnant and we don’t know how to tell them before we announce on social media when we are currently estranged.
Get ready for a long story that’s something as far fetched as a dramatic tv show. None of this has been dramatized.
My now husband and I have been together for 6.5yrs. He has two sisters one my age and one older. We are all in our thirties. My husband is the youngest and only boy. For a long time I was enamored and loved his family, my mother left when I was 13 and my family is good but also came with its flaws. I put his family so high on a pedestal praising them to everyone grateful for everything, we all loved eachother, my sil that’s my age was my bestie. She had dating trouble in the past and a year ago I set her up with someone. She had a guy who bought her a ring but they broke up and I remember he said to her, you don’t love me then way she (me) loved your brother. I was so happy i found her love I put him in our wedding party, took them on vacation and paid for their hotel stay. As we started to plan the wedding everything I dreamt of was shot down. I always wanted to elope up in the north east or Ireland, I wasn’t allowed it was too far and not fair for my Sil with two kids. I was told to have it in the state she lived because that would be easier on her by my mil. I found a venue closer to her but farther for my entire family. I was told I couldn’t go to my dream Bach location and she wanted to go to a different state so to make her happy I did it there. My mil at first was going to wear a cream and gold mermaid dress that looked like a wedding dress. she didn’t care I told her it looked white , until another aunt said something. Also my dress was mermaid and she also didn’t want a corsage anymore but a small bouquet. I couldn’t order from azazie for my bridesmaids because my sister in laws said it was cheap. We order from somewhere expensive and my two sil didn’t read the sizes and ordered too small, the oldest went behind my back and bought her own bright colored dress that didn’t match my bridesmaids. She got upset with me when I asked her why she did that behind my back. I ended up buying 4 dresses for my sil’s to have options spending 1k. My mother in law told my family they had to have exspensive alcohol at my shower that they told drink anything cheaper, My mother in law wanted to invite a lot of people and wanted a sit down dinner with everything to show off I told her I had to see what I could afford and she replied isn’t your father paying for your whole wedding? I replied no he will try to help where he can but financially this is all on me. My husband doesn’t make as much and couldn’t financially help. Nothing was enough, the oldest and my mother in law hated that I wanted dried flowers and minimal flowers they kept sending me messages saying I should have flowers. Eventually my mil said she’d pay for flowers I didn’t want so she could have them. I booked hair and make up and paid for everyone, my mil complained she wanted to be first and not last, even though I needed my bridesmaids first for photographs, she complained about it in my shower day too. She also said we should have an after party for my older sil because she and her husband don’t get to have fun often. That i have to have coach buses instead of school buses even though i couldn’t afford them and that it looked trashy. Right before my shower my dress was made wrong and was made for an A cup not DD cup, I was so upset I fought for a refund  and so did my sil law, I was grateful my mother in law and sister in law took me to the dress shop that the oldest sister bought her dress from. I ended up going alone with my nana and finding the perfect dress elsewhere. Leading up to my shower she invited 50 people, her cousins, the cousins kids, their girlfriends. I asked if we could cut back if we didn’t have to invite the oldest daughters best friend because she already rsvpd no to my wedding but that girl didn’t even invite her other daughter or myself to her own shower. She called me screaming saying I f*cking attacked her and that she should be invited. I said financially that’s a lot on my dad and I feel bad,  But she got her way because she snuck everyone’s address into the list to my step mom. On top of that they wanted more show off stuff at my shower, they went behind my families back and ordered $200 more stuff from the baker. My family found out and refused to pay. The baker told my in laws they were responsible and they said well cancel we aren’t paying….. but it was already made they were forced to pay. Right before my shower my grandfather who lived 3 hrs away was dying. I wanted to drive up to say goodbye but I told my sil that I’d pick her up from the airport. Even though her parents never get her nor did her bf. I told my mother in law I couldn’t get her and my mil said “are you sure he’s even dying? You really can’t get her? Well atleast bring her dog back before you go so she can see him.” Like my grandfathers death was an inconvenience, I felt guilty and picked her up, not only did I do that but I had to drive around town to the post office to Dunkin for her. I didn’t mind at first because she’s my best friend and I’d do anything for her, but what happened on my Bach broke me. Going back to the day of the shower I was sad I felt like everything became something for them to show off and less about my husband and I. My other bestfriend announced her pregnancy, my grandfather died, my maid of honor got wasted and crashed into another bridesmaid, it felt like no one cared about me on a day that should have been special. The next day my mil called and asked how I was. I said I’m sad with everything that happened and I’m nervous for my upcoming Bach trip because of all the planes falling out of the sky. Her reply made me feel less love. She said well it’s not fair that you and my son had to plan your trips on the same weekend, it’s not fair to your sil and bil to both have to leave their kids they have more to lose than you. That was my breaking point, I vented to my sil that was my best friend how sad I was, I was stressed with money paying for everything by myself, I felt heavy/chunky, I wasnt excited for the wedding because my husband and I only wanted a small elopement, and I said it hurt me that things I do get excited for that her mom and sister get upset with me. She ignored me for days, leading up to my Bach trip. The night before we were all supposed to leave my best friend begged my husband to call his sister to talk to me. At midnight she called me cursed me out her and her mother went at me saying I was a miserable bride that it’s not fair I feel that way, did I even want to marry her son? It was confusing, I ended up taking full blame and allowing the manipulation. 
The next day is the flight, I couldn’t eat, was nauseous. I got there and my friends did such a good job decorating I was grateful. I went up to my sister in law and said thank you for choosing this state it’s so beautiful, she turned to her sister and they both rolled their eyes at me. I couldn’t eat that night, I was so uncomfortable and on edge after being cursed out by my sil, the next morning I thought I was having a heart attack and rushed to the closest urgent care. The nurse was so kind and made me see it was the stress they put on me and that I was healthy. That day went great everything was going well. The one thing I asked for was a haunted tour but other than that I was an easy bride I let everyone choose what they wanted to do I was so easy. My sil said she couldn’t go she didn’t feel well and the other stayed behind. We got back from the tour and they were gone. Drinking martinis at the waterfront 20min away. I texted them if they were ok and they said they were looking for food when we had a 24hr wegmans below us and two restaurants next to our air bnb. I ignored their obvious lie and made the best of my Time. They ended up showing up and I made sure to stay near them that they were happy. We had a great night went to the wegmans were my sil was flirting with two British boys asking them to come on our boat the next day and to meet us at noon which…no I didn’t approve and girl you have a bf. I go to my room happy with the night take a shower and at 3:30am as I’m hanging in the living room with the people I’m sharing my room with both sil slam my door open and say “you here now!!!” Like I’m a dog who takes commands. She started cursing at me saying I bought the f*cking lap dances. I said lap dances for us? Confused and she said no!! For the f*cking guys!! I look to the older sister and say they went to a strip club? And she said yes you know. And I’m like what I didn’t know, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I blanked out as the sister closest in age to me is screaming and cursing I turn to my friends in shock and go to walk towards them to get away and my sil takes the door and slams it in my face so I can’t get away. Then time speeds up my friends spring to my defense saying get the f*ck out this is f*cking inappropriate. You want to slam doors fine we will slam doors. I get a call from my husband saying tell your friends to stay out of family business. I call him and tell him my friends were standing up for me and if he thinks it’s ok that his sisters attacked me I’m not marrying into an abusive family, that he never had my back this whole time I asked him for help with them, to tell them to just let us do what we wanted and paid for and his reply was always oh so you just hate my family. Which I didn’t I loved them I just wanted this to be my dream wedding which wasn’t a lot at all. He found out the truth and realized what happened. My sister in law that I set her up with believed a lie. Her boyfriend got caught going to the strip club even though she told him not to go, she screamed and cursed and belittled him, he got so upset and didn’t want to get yelled at he made a lie up. He told her it was my plan and that I paid for all 7 lap dances for every guy. I was floored. She’s known me for 6yrs and chose to believe a man she didn’t even know for a year yet. The next morning they told me to come to their room, I said I needed space that I was hurt by their actions. They turned it around and said I let my friends attack them, I was in the wrong and they are my family. I said my friends are my family and they had my back, they were the ones cursing me out slamming a door in my face. They were like fine it you want us to leave then we will leave. Obviously they had no apology for me so I said yes please leave. They called their parents saying I treated them Like trash and kicked them to the curb. The dad sent a text in the family group chat about Jesus dying on the cross for us and how dare we put the parents through this, no one standing up for me about a lie. The boyfriend apologized about going to the strip club, not about the lie and the father was like god forgives you. Didn’t know this family was super religious all of a sudden, they are holiday Catholics. I was the one who taught ccd in the past and went a lot but stopped as I got older for my own reasons. I left the group chat and made the best of the rest of the trip. Both trips were ruined, my husband and mine. My friends asked them to pay for the restaurants they came with us to after the trip and they refused, they also called my friends all white trash( when they are the ones cursing and drunk)  When we got back my husband was told to cancel the wedding that it’s either them or me, that I’m not the one for him. I’m no good. I went to their house a few days later to say my side. They didn’t believe me, they believed their daughters lies that they came in nicely and asked me to talk and didn’t curse and my friends attacked them for no reason. I said they did yell and they did curse, when have I ever lied or did anything wrong in 6 years, your daughter curses you out all the time how can you not believe me, the father started screaming and cursing at me at the top of his lungs saying you don’t want to get fucking cursed at!! This is high school shit get the fuck over it!!!! There is the fucking door get the fuck out of my house! I stood my ground and said I’m here out of love and respect and I ask you not to yell at me because I’m not yelling. The mom said “you’re a gaslighter and you are the reason your mother left you!” My mom left when I was 13 years old for context. I took hours to get through to her that I wanted to marry my husband and that we still want the wedding. She said well I already texted everyone that it was canceled and they canceled their room and flights. I said why would you do that tell them it’s still on its not too late. She said well our family won’t be attending. I was hurt. Beyond hurt. She then cried that she’d never be able to wear her dress…. What about me the bride? I lost more than half the amount of people I signed a contact for, I lost 35k, since this happened 3 weeks before the wedding. I told my dad and grandmother how I was treated at my in laws house. My nana texted his mom saying how much they want to see me and my husband happy and that they are upset they yelled at me. His mother was nasty and cursed at my 87yr old grandmother. She said I have everyone fooled but her family, they see right through me that I never wanted to marry their son, that I’m the reason my mother left me. Among other terrible things. After being caught by my husband that she cursed out nana she then realized how bad that made her look. She called me saying sorry I said that in the heat of the moment, but that I was a miserable bride and her oldest never acted that way and that I did this to sabotage my own wedding. I said her daughter didn’t have the stress I had, they paid for her wedding. I said I was excited I was just a stressed bride, I wouldn’t have paid for this , planned for 1.5yrs and did everything if I didn’t want it. The reason the wedding was canceled was because her daughters bf made a lie about me and your daughters attacked me. I said if they never attacked me they wouldn’t have been asked to leave. No one cares about a lie made about the bride they only cared about my reaction to their abuse but she says her actions should be forgiven because it was the heat of the moment and things got out of hand. She also said I wasn’t grateful that changed the color of my ring from silver to gold, I said one that is non of her business and two my husband should have known I only wear gold but his whole family wears silver do you can imagine the influence there. I did everything to please them for this wedding and it wasn’t enough. I realized this was inevitable, every girl he’s dated they treated poorly, neglected or cursed out. My husband and I ended up eloping at our dream location just the two of us which still cost 7,400$.
His mom called me 8 days before the elopement on my birthday that she wanted to be there and was crying, it was her fault my wedding was ruined and I said to make it fair it’s just going to be us but to make my husband have something for her, she loved starfish so I asked her for one of hers to make a boutonnière for him. She only had a broken one, I did find one and she replied oh I didn’t realize you wanted it that big. Always negative. The day we eloped only his mother congratulated us we heard nothing from his sisters or dad or brother in laws. I had my husband give them all the beautiful bridesmaids and groomsmen gifts and not a thank you was returned. The mother called me telling me I needed to get over what happened and that they are good Catholic people. As time went on I heard more talk from relatives of theirs that they didn’t believe what my in laws had to say. They talked poorly of me, eventually my husband got angry with them and cut off communication, especially after the sister got engaged to the liar. The mother in law has been freaking out to regain my husbands attention getting into small fender benders then calling her son saying she could have died and he didn’t care. The dad texting my husband cousin/best friend That my mil got admitted to the ER for a panick attack because my husband isn’t talking to her and that it’s our fault and we need to get over what happened. My husband told her she didn’t realize the damage she did to us, she said fine I’ll talk to you wife then and then she texted me for coffee to talk, nothing loving just cold what day works for you for coffee ( not that it matters but she knows I hate coffee and never had a cup in my life) making it a very cold statement. I opened up about my feelings and she didn’t reply for 5 days. That weekend two days after the text we had my husbands uncles birthday party, his mom tried to say hi to me but I walked away she couldn’t reply to my texts then I  won’t let her look good infront of everyone. No one approached us in his immediate family. His mom watched me the whole night with squinty eyes. All the relatives are on our side And they put distance between me and my mil that day as much as they could. Coincidently our first ultrasound was that Tuesday and she finally replied. She was  Very like ok I’m sorry but things got out of hand And do you want to be in this family or not? And kept repeating her question not acknowledging the things I was saying about being in her family or not. I told her How I was treated so poorly that lies were made about me by even her, she told everyone I never wanted to marry her son, she looked pretty silly when we still eloped on our planned wedding day. I said how it will take time to trust them again. Everything I did for this wedding was to please them. She chose to support her daughters unhealthy relationship over her sons healthy one. She turned on me and believed the lies of someone she barely knew. My husband and I are in therapy now to help us make healthy boundaries but there is so much damage now. There is so much wrong, they don’t care about what I went through, the man things they said about me both to my family, their relatives, and to my own face. I set my sister in law up with that man for her to be happy. I suffered to pay for their dream wedding. I allowed too much control I know, but I care less about me and more about everyone else’s happiness. They want us to get over it so his sister can have her dream wedding meanwhile she doesn’t even trust her fiance to go to strip clubs while she flirts with other men at the same time. I didn’t care about the strip club it’s a right of passage. Nothing is ever enough. I refuse to give them power over my baby. What do I do?",0,1757865709.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.5,False

1ngv027,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1ngv027/explore_best_travel_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Explore Best Travel Laundry Detergent Sheets Fisroa Worth It,"Laundry has always been a chore I don't look forward to, especially when traveling. The inconvenience of bulky detergents, potential spills, and limited space in luggage is enough to make anyone dread packing. When I started using the Fisroa Travel Laundry Detergent Sheets, I was hopeful they'd live up to their promise of convenience, eco-friendliness, and effectiveness. After trying these out numerous times over the last month, I’ve gathered plenty of thoughts to share, both positive and not-so-perfect.

**Convenient and Compact Design**  
One of the first things that caught my attention was the compact and lightweight nature of these detergent sheets. Unlike traditional liquid or powder detergents, these didn’t take up unnecessary room in my already-crowded suitcase. They’re flat, slim, and perfectly sized for travel, dorms, camping trips, or even quick weekends away. Sliding them into a small pouch in my carry-on was effortless. I didn’t have to worry about spills or leaks, a constant concern with liquid detergents. The pre-measured sheets further eliminated any guesswork, making the laundry process almost foolproof, even for those of us who usually eyeball measurements without much precision.  
[Check Fisroa Travel Laundry Detergent Sheets price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0dftmf1kp/)

**Eco-Friendly and Gentle Formula**  
The eco-conscious packaging is plastic-free and recyclable, which instantly scored points with me. Knowing I was reducing my personal impact on the environment felt great. Beyond its packaging, the detergent itself is plant-based, with gentle ingredients that didn’t irritate my sensitive skin—the fresh lavender scent was an added bonus. I could fold freshly cleaned clothes without the overpowering chemical smell left by some mainstream detergents. Even on delicate fabrics, these sheets performed like a pro, leaving my clothes soft and residue-free. 

**Performance and Stain Removal**  
I wasn’t sure what to expect when it came to how well these sheets could clean, but I was genuinely surprised. From coffee spills to workout gear drenched in sweat, these detergent sheets handled it all. Their low-foaming formula penetrated deep into fabrics, removing most stains and odors without much effort. For heavier stains like red wine or old grease, I soaked the clothing with the sheets for about 20 minutes before tossing them in the washer. This little trick worked wonders, although a separate stain remover was needed for particularly stubborn spots. While not every stain vanished entirely, it performed well above my initial expectations.

**Ease of Use and Dissolvability**  
Unlike powder detergents that sometimes clump or liquid ones that leave their sticky residue, these sheets dissolved effortlessly in both cold and hot water. The no-fuss approach freed me from the annoyance of scrubbing detergent residue off my laundry drum post-wash. I particularly liked their low-foam design, which meant less rinsing time and water usage. Whether I used a full sheet for larger loads or halved one for smaller batches, the application felt practical and intuitive.

**Boons**  
- Pre-measured sheets reduce the guesswork.  
- Travel-friendly design prevents leaks and saves space.  
- Environmentally friendly materials and packaging.  
- Gentle formula that suits sensitive skin.  
- Fresh lavender scent leaves clothes smelling clean.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles a bit with tough, ingrained stains like old grease or heavy mud.  
- Might feel pricey compared to bulk liquid or powder detergents for large families.  
- The sheets can sometimes stick together in high humidity, requiring a little patience to peel apart.

**Competing Products**  
I’ve tried other eco-friendly laundry solutions, such as detergent pods and liquid concentrates, and each has its own merits. Pods are comparable in ease but tend to come wrapped in plastic, making them less environmentally sustainable. On the other hand, liquid concentrates, while compact, still risk leakage during travel. As for traditional powder detergents, they’re cheaper yet so wildly inconvenient for travel. What sets these detergent sheets apart is the blend of portability, sustainability, and simplicity. None of the others feel as well-rounded.

**Price Performance**  
Compared to standard jug detergents, the cost per load might seem higher upfront. But factoring in the convenience, travel-oriented design, and eco-friendliness, the value becomes clear. This product is ideal for lightweight travelers, environmentally-conscious users, and those balancing space-saving with functionality. While it might not make sense for someone running multiple family-sized loads daily, it’s perfect for solo or small households who want practical, sustainable cleaning solutions.

Today’s tubs? They mostly feel like expensive coffee with lightning bolts on the label.

**The golden age**

Jack3d. Craze. Dark Energy.

DMAA and DMHA tubs that didn’t just wake you up, they gave each workout its own personality.

* One made music sound holy.
* Another turned spreadsheets into a life mission.
* A few had you checking if your heart was sprinting without you.

Unstable, reckless, unforgettable.

**The crackdown**

Then the lawsuits hit.

Ephedra banned. DMAA ripped out. DMHA under constant fire.

Courtrooms replaced forums, and seizures replaced hype drops.

Brands got the message. The wild west closed down fast.

**The safe age**

Now it’s all clean labels and cookie-cutter formulas.

Six grams of citrulline, little bit of beta alanine, 300mg caffeine, maybe a trendy nootropic.

They work. You get energy. But memorable? Not really.

They blur together like the same playlist on shuffle.

**The trade off**

To be fair, the newer stuff has upsides.

Reliable dosing, third party tested, no random “what did I just take?” panic.

You can train, recover, even sleep.

But we traded chaos for predictability.

That feeling of “am I about to ascend?” turned into “I’ll still function after legs.”

**Takeaway**

If you want steady long-term progress, today’s tubs make sense.

If you lived through Jack3d or Craze, you probably miss the lightning.

**Who this is for**

* People who remember the chaos era
* Lifters who wonder why today’s tubs all feel the same

* Beginners who just need clean energy
* Anyone who prefers safety over chaos

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The sun sets on Argentina as Tigre (“El Matador”) and Talleres (“La T”) prepare to clash in a match that feels like a Netflix drama where both leads forgot their lines. Let’s dissect this low-energy, high-stakes showdown with the precision of a surgeon and the wit of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many empanadas.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

The bookmakers have Tigre as a slight favorite at **2.5–2.6** (implied probability: **38–40%**), while Talleres sits at **3.0–3.3** (**30–33%**). The draw? A tidy **2.8** (**35–36%**). Translating this into human terms: it’s a three-way tie for chaos.

* **Tigre’s case**: They’re 12th in Group A, 3 points from the playoff zone, but have the “momentum” of a sloth on a coffee break—three straight losses and a Copa Argentina exit via a punch-to-the-throat defeat by Independiente Rivadavia. Their odds suggest “meh, maybe,” which is the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Bet here if you enjoy watching underdogs try to shock everyone.”
* **Talleres’ case**: They’re 14th in Group B, clinging to life in the relegation zone with 18 points. A draw would keep their playoff hopes alive, but their offense looks like a baker’s dozen that forgot three ingredients. Their odds? A polite “we’re not confident but also not *not* hopeful.”

### News Digest: When Tigers Forget to Roar

**Tigre**: Coach Diego Dabove’s squad is under siege. Their starting XI includes names like *Alfio Oviedo* and *Ignacio Russo*—sounds like a pair of Italian spies, not footballers. Recent form? A惨淡 as a cloud-covered full moon. They’ve lost their last three matches, including a Copa Argentina elimination that probably still haunts the players in their dreams.

**Talleres**: Carlos Tevez, the legendary goalscorer turned coach, is trying to resurrect a team that’s playing like a group of kids using a neighbor’s Wi-Fi du

The Brasileirão’s 23rd round pits two relegation zone survivors against each other: Atlético Mineiro (the *Galo*) and Santos (the *Peixe*). With both teams clinging to survival by their fingernails, this “six-point duel” promises drama, desperation, and a dash of synthetic turf chaos. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Brazilian striker and the humor of a fan who’s seen too many last-minute own goals.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Favorite?

The odds tell a clear story. Atlético Mineiro is the favorite at **1.83 to 1.88**, implying a **54-55% chance of victory**. Santos, meanwhile, sits at **4.2 to 4.45**, translating to a **22-24% chance**, while the draw ranges from **3.3 to 3.5** (a **29-30% probability**). These numbers suggest Atlético’s new coach, Jorge Sampaoli, has already instilled enough confidence in the market to make Santos an underdog worthy of a “long shot” coffee order.

The key stat? Atlético’s **24 points** (14th) vs. Santos’ **22 points** (16th). Both are perilously close to the drop zone, but the *Galo* has the psychological edge of hosting the match at Arena MRV, where their fans will roar like a pack of caffeinated jaguars.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Turf Wars, and Coaching Debut

Atlético’s recent form is a mixed bag. They just lost to Cruzeiro in the Copa do Brasil, and their last XI started a classic that ended in elimination. New coach Sampaoli, returning to the club after five years, is deploying the same squad that lost that derby—a move as risky as betting on a roulette wheel with a “relegation” section. Still, Sampaoli’s tactical tweaks ahead of the Copa Sudamericana quarterfinals might spark a revival.

Santos, meanwhile, faces a synthetic turf dilemma. Their star, Neymar, has **publicly criticized**

*Where History, Odds, and Goal-Difference Collide*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your espresso shots—this Serie A clash between AC Milan and Bologna is about to get *very* caffeinated. On Sunday, September 14, 2025, the Rossoneri will host the Rossoblu at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium (not to be confused with a certain *Mattia* stadium, which seems to be a ghost of Serie A’s past). With kickoff at 9:45 AM Cairo time—because apparently, these players need to start their day like it’s a 9-to-5 job—the stakes are high, the history is thorny, and the odds are screaming, “Milan, baby!”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Bookie is Already Betting on Milan

Let’s crunch the numbers like we’re statisticians in a *very* stylish puffer vest. The betting market has AC Milan as a near-even favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.85** (implied probability: \~54%). Bologna? They’re a distant fourth-place favorite at **4.5** (implied: \~22%), while the draw sits at **3.4** (\~29%). To put this in perspective, Bologna’s chances of winning are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite pizza topping.

The spread bets don’t exactly inspire confidence for Bologna either. Milan is favored by -0.5 goals, meaning they’re expected to win outright. Back the *away* team to cover the 0.5-point spread? Good luck—those odds hover around **2.05**, which is basically the price of a small espresso in Milan.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, History, and a Rivalry That Needs a Therapist

Both teams come into this match with recent wins—Milan thumped Lecce 2-0, while Bologna edged Como 1-0. But here’s the rub: **Bologna hasn’t beaten Milan away since January 2016**. That’s 17 losses in 24 attempts. For context, that’s like showing up to a chess match and losing to the same opponent *17 times in a row*. Mila

The stakes are as high as a goalkeeper’s pension fund in this clash of survival specialists. Gimnasia La Plata (“El Lobo”) and Unión Santa Fe (“Tatengue”) square off in a battle that’s less “glory” and more “don’t get eaten by the peloteros in the second division.” Let’s dissect the odds, news, and why this game feels like two boxers trading jabs in a sauna—everyone’s tired, but someone’s going home with a bruise.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers aren’t pulling any punches. Unión Santa Fe is the clear favorite here, with odds hovering around **+250** (implied probability: \~40%), while Gimnasia sits at **+320** (\~31%), and the draw at **+280** (\~35%). Translating that into plain English: Unión is the “I’ll take your money and your hope” pick, Gimnasia is the “let’s pray for a draw and a kinder referee” gamble, and the draw is the “I forgot to bet but still want drama” option.

The spread? Unión is favored by **-0.25 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win, but not by much—like a sloth racing a tortoise. The total goals line is **2.0**, with the under slightly favored. In other words, expect a game tighter than a goalkeeper’s grip on a penalty save.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Lineups, and Managerial Shenanigans

Gimnasia’s woes start with the absence of **Briasco**, their attacking spark plug, due to injury. Without him, their frontline resembles a wolf missing a whisker—still fierce, but slightly disoriented. Their lineup, led by **Insfrán** and **Seoane**, leans on experience but lacks the zip of a healthy Briasco. Coach **Orfila** is rolling with a backline of **Giampaoli** and **Susso**, which is solid but not exactly a wall you’d use to block a hurricane.

Unión, meanwhile, is cooking on gas. Manager **Leonardo Madelón** has welcomed back **Maizon Rodríguez**, a midfielder who’s as reliable as a coffee machine in the morning. His inclusion over **Ludueña** adds a fresh edge to Unión’s midfield, where **Palacios** and **Mauro Pittón** can now dance with more space. T

1nguv0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/complainaboutanything/comments/1nguv0g/judging_just_by_skin_colour/,Judging just by skin colour,"This is a long post, focuses on Canada, (I guess USA too) I had to organize my thoughts. 

With all the extreme hate and division going around with the protests (anti mass immigration) in Australia, Canada and now England, I do not feel safe anymore in my own country and it pisses me off so fucking much. Obviously this is all because of two reasons: 1. Mass immigration 2. Right-wingers are having a field day these days. It makes me angry that because of my skin colour I’m automatically seen as a foreigner. 

CONTEXT: 
I’m born and raised in Canada. In my fucking eyes, I AM CANADIAN and a proud one too. I grew up Summer- vacationing in Victoria, BC, I watched the house hippo commercials (legit thought it was real), I drenched my pancakes in maple syrup, I loved Nanaimo bars as a kid, Avril Lavigne was my QUEEN, I watched 6teen, Mona the Vampire, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast and every other early 2000s Canadian cartoon. 

My parents are Indian, specifically Punjabi. I’ve never been to India, I barely speak the language nor do I even care about visiting a country where cows are more respected than women. Everyday, I’m thankful for being born here because I know that I could have been born in India and who the hell wants that? Also, my parents worked hard, contributed to society through their labour and paid taxes. They own multiple properties now and they earned it. 

However, all because of the tan on my skin, the general public assumes I’m an international student from India because that’s all the rage right now, hating International students from India. When I begin to talk though, and people hear no accent, I’m treated like a normal human being, like something clicks in their brain when I talk and I can VISIBLY SEE WHEN THEIR BRAIN SAYS TO THEM, “oh ya she is Canadian.” 

MY QUESTION:
My question to the racists is this: how many generations does it take for a coloured person to be considered Canadian?? Because I see for example, plenty of Canadian born Ukrainian kids (I’m assuming because of the war, it makes sense of course). Those Canadian-Ukrainian kids are considered Canadian RIGHT AFTER ONE GENERATION. Their parents barely speak English or French (I work in healthcare I see it all the time) but they are white so, automatically Canadian. Indian-Canadians are getting close to 4th generation now in some provinces, so how many does it take for coloured Canadians to be considered actually Canadian?? Or is that title simply reserved for anyone with white skin?? (Diversity only amongst whites eh??). 
I can’t help but feel jealous of these white newly born kids, because they will always be considered more Canadian than me and it’s all because of their white skin. If you needed an example of white privilege well there it is.  

WHITE PRIVILEGE: 
You notice how in America, when people see an Italian-American, they say “omg he’s probably never even been to Italy, he’s American WITH Italian heritage.” So, why is the Indian-American not considered American WITH Indian heritage? Especially if they are multigenerational? Again, my conclusion is the skin colour. 

“THEY SMELL LIKE CURRY” 
Yes, the ones that are fresh off the boat do. They have not adjusted yet. They aren’t dirty, their food is just more pungent. Fresh curry smells great, rancid old curry is absolutely awful. Yes, they shower and use soap ffs. Yes, they have a strong accent, wtf do you want them to do about it? So, if any Indians from India, living in Canada are reading this, here are some tips: 
1. Don’t cook food in your “outside clothes.” 
2. Open windows and use the ventilation on top of the stove to air the place out
3. Close all doors when you are cooking (bedrooms, washrooms)
4. Use scent boosters (beads) that you throw into your washer when doing laundry


“IMMIGRANTS ARE TAKING OUR JOBS”  
Alright then blame your government for letting in huge amounts of unskilled labourers no? Politicians WANT you to blame the coloured folk that way they can keep working with corporations to keep slave labour going. If you lived in a poor country and you had the chance to escape it, would you not take that chance? No shit the Indians are taking all the Tim Horton-like jobs, the slave labour jobs in Canada must still be better than staying in India. 

“WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR CULTURE” 
The locals are right. This post is about thinking from both perspectives. For example, if you move to Québec, parle en français. Also, I don’t want to see any Québécois annoying me about this in the comments because your culture is heavily protected. So much so that housing, STM and everything else is in the gutter. But then again, Indians (and other ethnic groups) move to ESCAPE, they probably don’t think about learning the culture of the locals, this comes later on either when they are settled or the kids become the first ones to integrate properly.

“CRIME RATES HAVE GONE UP” 
Okay then deport the ones committing crime. Did you know OBAMA was actually the president that deported the most illegal immigrants? I was shocked too, but you know why no one really cared? Because he was not deporting people for simply being coloured. Every ethnicity has their bad batch, especially when they are living in poverty. What happens to people when they live in poverty? They commit crime or maybe they just genuinely are bad people and moved here with bad intentions. 

***We all know that when a coloured person does something negative it automatically gets associated with their whole community. Meanwhile, when a white person commits a crime, the news will separate them from the general public, saying things like “oh he was a lone wolf, mentally unstable blah blah blah.”****. 
SA numbers have gone up a lot, sooo deport the bad ones. I’m Punjabi, I know a perverted uncle or man when I see one. 
According to StatsCanada, crime in general HAS gone up. But if anyone bothered to do the damn research, it’s HATE CRIMES that have gone up (since 2023) and hmmmm I wonder which groups are being targeted the most…..If you are actually interested I can leave the link to the StatsCan article. Btw, same thing is happening in Ireland. 

“OUR PEOPLE/ANCESTORS BUILT THIS COUNTRY” 
I love this argument, it’s my favourite one tbh.  
You’re right, the French, British, Irish (physical labour) and Scottish descendants DID BUILD THE COUNTRY. They made laws and policies that only benefited one demographic. They took care of the management and were the higher ups. What usually happened when a coloured person tried to make change back then? They were killed (MLK is a good American example and literally every time Indigenous Canadians tried to rebel). So, here’s some examples of coloured people’s contributions to helping build AND MAINTAINING the country (included some world history too):

1. Canadian Railway was built by the Chinese (many died, the ones that survived were not given Canadian citizenship), Indigenous people, Irish and Scottish 
2. Fur trade: First Nations and Métis people collected beaver pelts (in exchange for huge guns) that’s why the fur trade was so successful
3. Black people (who were free at first) used as slaves to build the colony and fought alongside the British to prevent American invasion. They were soldiers, pilots and mostly labourers. 
4. The Irish and Scottish built this country with their hands as well, I don’t hate white people, I’m just frustrated, they helped build a beautiful country. 
5. More recent history: WWI, Indians and Arabs made up the largest ethnic group to fight in WWI. So, if the axes power won, they would have dominated Europe and seized  control of all colonies. 
6. WWII: African-Americans made up the bulk of the coloured -American troops (around 1 million). Around 80% were white-American soldiers. The British Empire got their bulk of soldiers (over 1 million) from India. Also, of course plenty of other colonies.
7. Even more recent contributions (taken from Google): Immigrants, with a significant proportion coming from Asia, particularly India, contribute to Canada’s economic growth by filling labour needs“ (If you want source, let me know) 
8. Google: “men and women of Chinese and South Asian descent often show higher cumulative earnings, which are largely attributed to high education levels and over representation in STEM fields” (If you want source let me know) 

“WESTERN CULTURE IS SUPERIOR”
People are going to hate me in the comments for this one but I don’t care, western culture is the superior culture. I’m extremely westernized and I love it. What I do hate is when western countries steal cultural things from minorities and call it their own. Here’s a small list of things that came from ethnic minorities that have been adopted or straight up taken by western civilization:
1. Maple syrup, the process,  method and the tradition all came from the Indigenous peoples of Canada, but who do we associate with maple syrup??? Les Québécois. 
2. Corn, beans, squash, berries, hunting elk etc… all from the Indigenous peoples.
3. Lacrosse (Canada’s national summer sport) was invented by Natives 
4. Indigenous inventions (some): Canoes, snowshoes, ASPIRIN!!!, kayaks, sunglasses
5. Indian things: The number zero, the decimal system, tea, snakes & ladders, yoga, cataract surgery, shampoo, yea yea spices too but that’s the obvious one. “Indians only contributed spices to the west” is something that I hear a lot and it pisses me off because it wasn’t just spices. 
6. Coffee originated in ETHIOPIA
7. Arab influence: The first ever University (a woman), algebra, numerals, contributed greatly to astronomy (so many stars have arabic names) and the study of optics 
8. The Fibonacci sequence and Quadratic equation are not western ideas lol 
9. Eyeliner came from Egypt

“SHE’S JUST TRYING TO APPEASE THE WHITE MAN” 
Why can’t we all just get along? 
Coloured people love saying this in the comments and frankly I don’t care. I am a mix of western and Indian (but I do prefer western culture more). Maybe I wish I was light skin so that people wouldn’t assume that I’m a foreigner OKAY I’M SORRY!!! I’m also not “self-hating” I don’t hate the way I look and everyone knows Indians have the most flawless head of hair and obviously the food is amazing. I just hate the fact that people look at me and aren’t able to see “Canadian first.” 

IMMIGRANT ON IMMIGRANT HATE:
We are lacking empathy (the rich white male demographic especially), it’s so important to have empathy and think about life from other people’s perspectives these days. The worst is when I see immigrants shitting on OTHER IMMIGRANTS, like seriously????? Ireland these days too is just disappointing, especially considering their history. 

Soo, in conclusion, let’s all just work on getting along eh?

Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is still running stubbornly hot at 3.1%. On paper, these are small percentages. In real life, they’re a gut punch.

Shelter costs — rent, mortgages, insurance — continue to eat up a massive share of household budgets. Power bills are climbing, with electricity prices up ~6% from last year, and groceries are sneaking upward again after a few months of relief. Coffee, meat, and dairy are leading the surge, which anyone doing a weekly shop can feel immediately. Meanwhile, producer prices (PPI) have risen for the fourth straight month — the costs behind the scenes that will soon trickle down to every checkout line.

For regular people, this is more than an “index.” It’s a series of choices that nobody wants to make:
	•	Skip the AC on a sweltering day to save on your power bill.
	•	Trade fresh groceries for shelf-stable filler to keep food costs predictable.
	•	Watch rent climb while wages stagnate.

And when policymakers talk about interest rates, “core inflation,” or “soft landings,” it’s clear they’re living in a world where this data is abstract. But for families, it’s a weight that never lets up.

This isn’t just about math. It’s about systems built to protect profits, not people:
	•	Tax policies and subsidies that keep corporations flush while households drown.
	•	A housing market designed to reward investors, not renters.
	•	Infrastructure (power, water, transportation) now under immense pressure from AI buildouts, data centers, and urban sprawl — costs that inevitably hit communities.

This is why r/VoicesForChange exists. We’re building a space for more than headlines. We want stories. Solutions. And yes, righteous anger. This is for anyone who’s tired of feeling like their struggles are “just part of the data.”

So let’s start here:
	•	What went up for you in August?
	•	How are you adjusting?
	•	What would actually make a difference where you live",1,1757865202.0,VoicesForChange,1,1.0,False

Pretty much everything I know about making espresso I know from JH, and as we know, freezing beans should be fine. Well, in my experience, frozen and then thawed (room temperature at least over night) beans just behave differently.

FYI, I'm using a Eureka Mignon Specialita with a single dose hopper and a 0-100 dial. Never-frozen beans I dial in around 5-10 from zero, but after-frozen, I'm really around 0 and the shots still pull in <20s. Espresso machine is a bar-modified Gaggia Classic Pro.

I've been thinking about getting a hot chocolate maker for a while now, and I wanted to share my research and thoughts with you all. I know winter is coming up, and there's nothing better than a warm cup of hot cocoa on a chilly evening.

I recently discovered that making hot chocolate isn't just about mixing powder with hot water anymore. These dedicated hot chocolate makers (like this one I found: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) are actually pretty interesting. They're designed to heat and froth your drink perfectly, giving you that cafe-style experience right at home.

What really caught my attention is how versatile these machines are. Sure, they make amazing hot chocolate, but you can also use them for other beverages like chai lattes, regular lattes, and even cold drinks. Plus, they're great for melting real chocolate - none of that powdered stuff if you don't want it.

I did some number crunching, and here's what I figured out: If you're buying hot chocolate from coffee shops regularly (like I was), a hot chocolate maker could pay for itself in just a few months. Those $4-5 drinks add up quickly!

The main benefits I've found:
- Perfect temperature control (no more burning your tongue!)
- Consistent results every time
- No more lumpy chocolate at the bottom
- Easy to clean (most parts are dishwasher safe)
- Can make multiple servings at once

After checking out various options (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker), I learned that most machines come with different settings for various drinks. Some even have automatic programs for different types of chocolate - milk, dark, or white.

The only downside I can see is that it's another appliance to store in your kitchen. But if you're like me and drink hot chocolate or similar beverages regularly, it's totally worth the counter space.

What I really love is that you can experiment with different recipes. You can use real chocolate bars, cocoa powder, or even make your own mix with added spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. It's pretty fun getting creative with it!

For families, it's especially great during the holiday season. Kids love watching the chocolate melt and mix, and you can control exactly what goes into their drinks. No artificial preservatives unless you want them!

So, in my opinion, if you drink hot chocolate more than a few times a month or enjoy making special drinks at home, it's definitely worth the investment. The convenience and quality of the drinks you can make at home will probably surprise you.

Don’t get me wrong. I love media. I love the ability of our times for millions of people to share a learning they made on a day and share it with other millions of people immediately. How beautiful is this opportunity for collective education?

But there can be too much of anything. And the easiest way to counter it is by having a Zen practice in your life.

**What is Zen?**  
Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and direct experiential insight over theoretical knowledge or ritual. You probably have come across pictures of Japan with very structured minimalist gardens - that‘s Zen. The beautiful thing about Zen is that anything can become a meditation. You don’t have to sit down for 1 min in the lotus posture and „meditate“. Meditating like that would already be advanced because it is a new additional practice. Instead, choose an activity you’re doing every day anyway and make that activity a meditation. Doing the dishes every day - why not make it a meditation? No music, no podcast, nothing.

Just you and the doing.

**How do you practice Zen?**  
I personally started my Zen practice recently by making coffee with a martor and pestle. In the course of minimalism I threw away three broken electric grinders to one immortal stainless steel mortar and pestle that’s going to serve me for the rest of my life. Now in the morning grinding my coffee with the mortar has become my Zen practice, this beautiful stillness and the coffee becomes even more of a highlight because I had to grind the beans myself.

This is actually why the Japanese are amazing craftsman because they make anything a meditation, making tea, martial arts, including work and making high quality cars.

Now imagine how this could compound in your life. If you make just one activity in your daily life a meditation it will not just make you better st that one activity, but you will become more focused in all other activities as well.",1,1757864818.0,Libari,0,1.0,False

My spouse has a much different threshold when it comes to seeing dirt. When he considers an area dirty, we are already at the stage where I would be ready to set the place on fire and move on. 
However, this week we had a family cleaning day, which led to him volunteering to clean the bathroom. Yay!

He did clean that room, but left the bucket standing in the corridor, together with all the stuff from the bathroom he had to move around. 

I decided to make it an experiment to see when he would put stuff back. Two days later I broke down and took it, because I had to use the bucket. I swear, it would otherwise stand where he left it, until he needed to use it next time.


This is such an annoying pattern.
 He does something in the kitchen? Packages, scissors, pans etc will stay exactly where they were dropped. Get kids from daycare ? Bags with dirty clothes stay on the floor.

I’ve been orthodox for almost 10 years at the same parish about four years in a different priest took over our parish. I was at rock bottom when he took over in an extremely physical and emotionally abusive marriage. I was suicidal and extremely vulnerable. Once he took over I started meeting with him and I feel stupid because I haven’t ever questioned him until now because I’ve been too afraid of being disobedient. Since the beginning, I’ve always walked away from our meetings with confusion, fear and uncertainty. In the beginning, he tended to side with my abusive exhusband until my ex started verbally attacking and threatening my priest. Then finally, my priest believed me and allowed (not blessed) me to get a divorce. 

I was a single mom with three young children for a couple years and then he started pressuring me to get back together with my other ex-husband (note: I have been married twice and this was my first daughter’s father —not my younger two kid’s). That marriage was also abusive physically and psychologically. We had been married super young & The man has always been neurotically obsessive and controlling about me. He was very clingy when we were together 13 year ago and I felt like I had no freedom to breathe in that relationship. He became very physically violent towards the end of it when I voiced these things to my priest, he dismissed them and proceeded to tell me that it was my fault that he was violent toward my kid and I and it was because he was scared that I was suicidal at the time (which I was severely depressed). I believed him and was just in such a raw vulnerable place because I was now on my own with three kids dirt poor and felt like I didn’t have any other choice but to get back together with this man. 

This man has always been waiting for me to get back together with him even when I was remarried. I’ve always felt like he was lurking around the corner. I’ve never felt attracted to him if anything I’ve always felt repulsed by him. So anyway my spiritual father convinced this man to come into the Orthodox Church to receive holy baptism so he did and thank God I have seen the church really transform him over the past couple years. He went from being a borderline Satanist to a humble family man. He genuinely is remorseful for the way he has treated me and acknowledges his past abusive sins no excuses or blame. We ended up getting married by this priest. He actually has expressed frustration with our spiritual father because he feels like this priest is just enabling him and puffing him up. He’s frustrated because he has these passions and sins he needs to work through and the priest just sees him in rose colored glasses. I on the other hand have been told every time I ever bring my questions or struggles to this priest about forgiving my ex-husband and being able to heal our relationship from the past trauma and abuse and dismissed and told that I’m not attracted to him because I’m too vain and that I’m going to the worst place in hell because I can’t except my ex ex-husband’s love. (now this man is very loving and genuinely repentant which I see, but none of my past trauma from the abuse has ever been addressed. It’s always been denied and covered up by my priest so I’ve had no way to heal and I’m still stuck in fighter flight mode when I’m around my ex-husband. I avoid him at all cost, and I’m terrified of him even though he is a completely different person). 

This priest told me a couple of weeks ago that my vanity was so bad that it would be interesting if I got in a car accident and my face got disfigured, or if I got cancer of the mouth and lost all my teeth, or lost my right hand (Im an artist). He has also told me that he wants to scream at me so loud that the flesh on my face melts off. (keep in mind that I don’t wear a lot of make up, I don’t dye my hair, I try my best to dress modestly in church wearing long dresses or skirts and covering my head. I do like to feel pretty and healthy so I try to exercise, eat healthy, and sometimes wear a little bit of mascara I also don’t argue with this priest. I’m too scared. I’ve always tried to be polite when I’ve had questions phrase them in a way that is out of a desire to understand and not by a means of trying to prove my priest wrong). He rarely offers me encouragement and all of our couples counseling meetings have been spent berating me and showering my husband with praise. He has made me leave the room during couples counseling so that way he could talk negatively about me to my husband. This priest is constantly giving my husband scriptures to read about men in the Bible married to ungodly women. My husband is getting so frustrated with this priest. And feels terrible for the way my spiritual father treats me. All along I have been in denial and been convinced that this is my fault and I just need to be more obedient and repent deeper and that I’m the one at fault. But something recently has really caused me to start wondering if this man is really the best person to be my spiritual father… every time I’m around him in church. I feel like a deer in the headlights. I feel sick to my stomach around him and absolutely terrified of him. I’m constantly afraid that I’m going to burn in hell . I’ve even questioned whether or not orthodoxy is for me because I’m too much of a wicked sinner for it. And that maybe I made a mistake by getting baptized because now I’m gonna face a greater judgment. 

I hear very similar stories from other women in our parish that are frustrated with our priest, but it’s very kept quiet. Most of the parish is very subservient and is convinced that our priest is a saint. When I’ve tried to go to one of the nuns in our church (who I’ve been friends with for years) she very strongly defends our priest and indicates to me that any doubts I have about our priest is because I’m too rebellious. I’m so frustrated because I feel like I’m in a spiritual limbo where I have these passions and sins that I want to overcome, but I’m terrified to go deeper in my faith because I’m so afraid of burning in hell. 

Our parish has a lot of odd behaviors to it that I’m starting to wonder if this is normal parish behavior or if these are signs of a cult (not saying that our parish is a cult just that maybe it has signs)… we view anyone that walks out of our parish and starts going to a different parish as rebellious or disobedient and pity them. Our priest tends to side with the men when it comes to spiritual counseling, I’ve heard this from other women that are confused too, but too afraid to leave. One woman came out in a mass email to all the women in our church., saying that her husband raped her and that she was really struggling on how to heal from this feeling betrayed and then came back a week later saying that our priest told her to apologize for sending the email out in the first place and saying that she didn’t mean to scandalize anyone and  she needs to not gossip about her husband because it will hurt the marriage. All of the women in our church only wear long skirts and dresses even outside of church, seeing even loose jeans or long shorts as sinful things for women to wear. 

Our church  is huge and has quadrupled in size since covid has created all these little sub organizations out of it (private school, a farm, men’s and women’s groups, housing opportunities, a couple of orthodox brands with our priest’s icons, coffee roasting business, podcasts, a large (only women’s) monastic group attached to the church, etc. All these things being claimed to be used as a means for our community to be more self-sufficient and less reliant on big government)… but it can also feel very isolating because when I choose not to enroll my kids in the private school and instead homeschool, I feel very shamed by our priest. With all these bells and whistles In our church it can feel like a celebrity or branded parish (very elite) idk how else to describe it… 

Anyway, I am scared to leave because all of our friends are at this parish everyone there except for our priest is so loving and kind and humble and has been there for me from the bear very beginning. All of our kids friends are there they’ve been our family all these years we even bought a house right down the street from the church. We have devoted our family‘s life to this parish so leaving feels like it’s just not an option. I feel very confused right now and uncertain of how to proceed. Maybe I’m just in the wrong because of my rebelliousness? I just I’m looking for some other orthodox perspectives outside of our little bubbly in this parish that we are in… 

Forgive me tldr; this has just been building for years and I really need some outside perspectives.

He mentioned that his step mom, whom we adore and has always been supportive of our choices, once said that she was ""disappointed that we won't be having children, but proud that we are doing what's right for us."" This is similar to some of the things his dad has said to us as well.

Personally, I don't believe there are any ""wrong"" feelings. People can have whatever feelings or opinions they want about my choices, but they don't all need to be expressed. I told my husband he needs to nip comments like this in the bud (or I will). If we told our family and friends with kids that we're disappointed that they had children instead of remaining childfree, that would be deemed wildly disrespectful, and we would be discouraged from expressing such opinions. However it's totally fine for other people to make similar comments about our reproductive choices. Why? What are they expecting me to do with that information? My husband and I are both sterilized, so it's not like we're going to have a baby to please these people. It's also a subtle reminder that my in-laws will never feel the same way about us as they feel about their other children who have or plan to have kids. These clowns need to understand that, ""I'm disappointed you won't have kids, but proud your doing what's best for you"" is not the compliment they think it is. The disappointment completely cancels out the praise.

Everything signed and the loan is active:   
Loan amount: RM 801,992 ( Loan - 760,500 | MRTA - RM 41,492)   
Interest: 3.55% under UOB

I got the full MRTA because I feel my family should inherit it without any worries. 

\--

To be honest, the real trigger was a simply remark from someone whom I got infatuated - ""Are you going to be here for good?"", yup that's all it took to convert me, I was against buying because the math just doesn't make sense, 800K loan but paying another 600K as interest!?   
  
And just this quarter, I realized I really do need a job change and the fact that I might have a reduced pay (location might be different too), I guess that's life. Though, I have not started serving the full loan, and I could still move and reduce the rental right now based on my pay, but it's not something I could do in another 3 years. Well, will I still want to move from jobs to jobs when I am 37? I am not sure myself. 

Anyway, anyone else bought this project? Would love to connect :)

Death was inside the car that afternoon.

Staring out the window, Death watched the wind move through the brown stalks that bordered the road as the car whizzed past, the sun glancing off the field and the road in alternating patches of dark and light, turning the stalks to gold. Pillars of clouds rose on the distant horizon, and the hills were covered in a purple haze. Taza had one hand on the steering wheel, the other resting on the drive shaft, squinting through his sunglasses at the bright patches of sun on the road ahead, clear as far as the eye could see to where it seemed to disappear into the hills.

​Asma sat in the back, staring idly out the window. She was watching the golden fields and tracking a swooping shape stark against the bright blue sky, appearing to float above the road and grasses. It had been an hour since the last rest stop, and they were on this empty stretch of road for what seemed like ages. She leaned forward to the passenger seat and tapped Lisa on the shoulder. “Check out that hawk out the window,” said Asma. Lisa turned to look.
​“That’s a vulture, I think, not a hawk,” Lisa said, squinting up at the sky. Death leaned over to take a closer look and Lisa leaned forward and drummed her hands on the dash. Taza switched hands on the wheel.

​Taza enjoyed driving, the feel of the car responding to each nudge and the attention required to keep everything steady and moving. He had put in extra hours at work this week at the hospital and was feeling the strain. There had been crisis after crisis at St. Mary Heart, and it seemed to him that people were acting a little more recklessly than usual. The other day he had reattached two fingers on two separate people, narrowly avoided removing someone’s appendix due to a mix-up, had removed a rusty nail from someone else’s foot, and performed a blood transfusion on a person that had survived a rockslide. This weekend was a welcome break. A drive up to the lake seemed like the perfect antidote, even with what had happened last year. Michael and Joan had both refused to come if the other was planning to attend, which resulted in neither making an appearance.

​They had all met at the lake in midsummer last year, just like this. The idea was a weekend getaway. A chance to catch up. The weekend had started off great, with all of them lounging by the lake, and the breeze had blown through the trees lakeside and brought a welcome respite from the humidity and the mosquitos. They had swum and eaten, and the campfire had started quickly and burned brightly. The lake weekend last year had ended along with Michael and Joan’s relationship. Their little friend group seemed like it had permanently shrunk. His foot pressed down on the accelerator and the car sped along the empty road.

Death glanced out the driver’s side window, and Taza took a quick glance to the left. I’m bored, Death whispered.

​“I’m so bored,” said Lisa from the passenger seat.

​“You can take over driving again at the next stop.”
Lisa fiddled with the tuning dial, which alternated blared static and snatches of tunes, searching for a signal. Death hummed along to the static.

​“Do we have Bluetooth in this car? I can hook up my phone,” Asma said.

​“I don’t think so, it’s an older rental.” Taza hit a button on the dial, and they were graced with more static as the radio rapidly scanned through different frequencies. The car lapsed into silence again. Asma leaned back in her seat, resting her head. She looked at the empty seat to her left. Her boyfriend was supposed to come on this weekend trip with them but had been acting oddly distant all week. She was worried that he was going to break up with her and was almost glad that it wouldn’t happen at the lake. No one needed a repeat of last year. Her boyfriend had called her that morning to cancel because he was stressed at work, and she had accepted without a fuss, hoping that a bit of space and distance would give them time to reflect.

He had asked her out at the library. She was browsing the new fiction section and glancing through all the books displayed on top of the shelf, and he’d come around the other side of the low shelf and picked up the same book she had been thinking about. They started talking about the series it was from and the chat turned into coffee, which turned into dinner. And then, the first few months had passed in a blur of new love. Now their relationship had settled into a routine of work and weekends that felt normal yet mundane, and she wondered if he was getting restless.

​At dinner a few nights ago, she had brought up the lake and he had seemed excited. They had been out at an Italian place near his apartment, one of his favorite restaurants. She had offered to share appetizers and he had declined. He had also declined dessert. After that she kept wondering if something was wrong, but she didn’t know what, and it seemed silly to bring it up when she wasn’t even sure if anything was wrong. This weekend trip to the lake would help take her mind off of it, and the future.
​
Death leaned over, patted Asma’s hand. This weekend will be so fun, I can’t wait to get there, Death sighed. Asma shivered and hugged her arms to her body. “I can’t wait to get there. How much longer do we have left?”

​“Uhhh, about another hour and a half.” Taza said, glancing at his phone attached to the dash. Let’s go a bit faster, Death murmured. “There’s no one on this road, I can speed up a bit for this stretch.” Taza eased his foot down on the pedal, and the dial inched up.

Lisa leaned forward in her seat. Her fingers absentmindedly rubbed the edge of the top she was wearing. She was feeling a bit reckless herself. She’d attended an all-hands meeting at her company yesterday and things didn’t seem good. She expected the announcement for layoffs soon. Picturing the pile of bills sitting on the kitchen counter of the apartment she shared with Taza made her anxious, as did the new top she was wearing that she shouldn’t have purchased. Taza didn’t know it was new. She had a plan to get out of her debt and decided to start on Monday after lounging by the lake and not thinking about her problems. “How fast can we go in this car?” she asked Taza.

Asma looked up in alarm, bracing her hands against the seat. The grasses passed by with increasing speed. “Careful Taza! I don’t want to die before seeing the lake!”

Death grinned in anticipation. Taza grinned and pressed his foot on the accelerator, watching the dial inch upwards. The hum of the engine became a growl. They were well past the speed limit and still accelerating; the scene out the window became a gold and blue blur dotted with green smears and black streaks.

Death arched its back and its neck bones creaked. It could feel the increase in speed of three heart beats that matched the speed of the car, racing like a hi-hat; three sets of lungs breathed deep, and blood surged through veins and arteries like the wash of sea on a beach. Death drank life, the opening and closing of valves, the pulses of crimson, the flood of adrenaline and raw emotion sweeping with the air speeding past. Death grew intoxicated, stretched its bones and threw back its head, relishing, devouring, drinking in the moment. The three lives in the car hung in the balance, on the strength of their life force. Lisa laughed and Asma screamed, Taza held the steering wheel tight as they shot along the road for a few more seconds.

Taza took his foot off the accelerator but didn’t press down on the brakes, letting them coast for a few hundred feet on the surge of fuel and power that had brought them this far. The hills in the distance looked no closer, and they were still at least an hour’s drive from the lake. He opened all the windows of the car and let in a hot breeze that rustled the snack and coffee receipts in the cup holder and caught Lisa’s hair in a tangle. Lisa stuck her fingers out, fluttering them on the wind. They had left the vulture far behind, but the golden fields of grass seemed unchanging, as did the black stretch of road.

“That was amazing.”

“I never want to do that again,” Asma said from the back.

Lisa chuckled, said, “Yeah, that was probably enough,” as Taza continued to slow the car down.

Hi all
I’m not doing great getting my V60 technique dialled in and am easily confused between sour and bitter. I just get “unpleasant”? 
Started with an Aeropress for a few years, eventually got a Wilfa Svart (really improved my coffee) and then a Fellow EKG gooseneck and a  Switch 03, then a V60. I’ve even bought a ZP6 special grinder. 
You can tell I am keen to get it right! 

I tried the very helpful seeming Onyx Coffee Lab guide to tasting test a few times 
https://youtu.be/QgYNCTiZKQs
But although I get “sour” on cup A and some on B I never seem to reach “bitter” on cup C even grinding finer and finer. 
I can drink Ferber Branca straight, it and Campari do taste bitter but it’s a taste I like. 
So I’m thinking of getting filter training. I don’t want to waste any more good beans ‘;~}.

1ngu9qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ngu9qe/my_dad_65m_destroyed_my_38m_best_years_and_gave/,My dad (65m) destroyed my (38m) best years and gave me severe PTSD,"So I live in the US and grew up in an upper class suburban neighborhood, had two siblings and both parents. In simple words, my parents were very impersonal, emotionally neglectful people who showed love solely through gifts and providing for us financially.

I was a very emotion driven, sensitive boy growing up  and I deeply craved emotional connection and meaningful, personal conversations... I never received any emotional support or encouragement from my parents, never any personal conversations where they tried to get to know me on a deeper level. 

And as a result, as i got older my parents knew nothing about me on a personal level. Like I'm deeply passionate about poetry and movies, and music, and my parents, especially my dad, couldn't even tell you what my favorite movies and music are, or why. 

My mom is a bit more gentle and easier to talk to than my dad. He is much more so emotionally distant, never seen him really cry or be vulnerable. But, both of my parents are incredibly emotionally distant, impersonal people who don't know anything about me on a personal level.

Fast forward many years later and I'm in my mid 20's, back living with my parents after college, working at a coffee shop. 

Now, I had become a completely different person when i went away to college. I became a Christian in a very personal and spiritual NON-religious way. My parents and siblings didn't understand this.

A couple years later, I trusted the wrong christian mentor, and long story short it led me to walking away from opportunities in life and burning bridges with friends. I was at a school out of state, and walked away from that school to go back to living at home... lost some important friendships and didn't really have much direction in my mid 20's.

I was very influenced by this christian mentor, and she believed God personally spoke to her all the time, and even though I didn't experience that, I told my parents that God can speak to you all the time.

I also believed the world was soon to be ending and told my parents about this. This mentor believed this wholeheartedly and so did many people my age who followed her, so I believed it as well.

I didn't really have any substantial friendships around this time. I met up with a few new potential friends, some women, but they didn't go the distance. 

I was just working at this coffee shop, and when I could go home I would be in my parents basement on the computer for many hours.

I never drank alcohol or did drugs. I was physically active with riding my bike a lot. I enjoyed my job at the coffee shop and would often close up the place by myself. It was a good gig, and despite being spiritually mislead, life was going okay enough. I was never depressed or anything.

At some point around this time, knowing how much my parents misunderstood me and were somewhat concerned, I felt such a deep rush of peace on day and a deep desire to have a personal, transparent dialogue with them addressing any of their concerns...

Like I said way earlier, growing up my parents never knew much about me, and I could still tell they had lots of misunderstandings about me and i wanted to quell their fears and clear up their misunderstandings about me. I wrote a peaceful note and placed it on the kitchen table, and they never followed up with me on this, which hurt my heart. 

Here's where things took a drastic turn...

Around six or so months later, a sheriff walked into my bedroom at 4AM with my dad, to tell me that I'm going downtown to be evaluated. I got in the cop car and was driven downtown to a psych ward. 

This was scary for me, because I was VERY against psychiatry and medication, so this was scary for me. 

My parents stood before a judge and were able to convince them, with the help of a lawyer, to send me to a psych ward against my will as an adult... my dad knew i was deeply against psychiatry and would refuse this, so he had to force me this way.

There was this false report written about me that said all kinds of lies like I was depressed, had anger problems, and claimed to hear voices... NONE of which were true. 

The lawyer told my dad to stretch the truth in the most extreme way possible, and that's what he did... so me living at home and spending lots of time in the basement on the computer means i was depressed... me having one physical altercation with my dad eight years earlier, where I just pushed him and nothing happened to him, meant there was 'violence in the family""... me believing God speaks to my heart means I was ""hearing audible voices"".

and thus, doctors at this hospital quickly labeled me as a schizophrenic who also has severe anger issues, and is depressed...

my parents were also proven to have no ""ill intent"" to the judge, and that helped them accomplish sending me to a psych ward against my will as an adult.

the truth about me, is that i have never been a danger to myself or anyone else, and never have i been depressed, never heard voices... i was a healthy normal guy just in a rough patch where I didn't have really any meaningful friendships, big deal.

i stayed at the psych ward for 5 days before being released, and being deemed as having NO MENTAL ISSUES... and my parents later apologized for misunderstanding me and misjudging me... nonetheless, i suffered severe trauma from this, lots of paranoia and mental hurdles for MANY years.

My parents were still incredibly impersonal people, and failed to build trust with me so that i could feel safe and respected by them after this traumatic event.

Now, this whole psych ward thing was not my mom's decision, it was solely my dad's decision... and it blows my mind how many missteps he made. 

His whole thought process just seems incredibly careless and foolish to the highest degree...

1 - He fully knew that I was deeply against psychiatry, and that I'm also a very sensitive person... so any sane thought process when thinking about sending me to a psych ward against my will, should be the POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS of doing that to me... something like,

""I know how much my son hates psychiatry, and he is very sensitive... I'm not a very personable person and I could see him needing lots of reassurance and personal validation and expression from me to help him feel safe and build trust after this event... and I struggle with that, and I could see this becoming something that severely alters the trajectory of his life.""

Any thoughtful person should have been able to ponder those potential ramifications when considering forcing their son to a psych ward... and then immeditately decided to not do it.

2 - After pondering that, my dad should have considered some other alternate route, because he was concerned for me and wanting to make sure everything is okay. 

3 - He could have literally just had a personal conversation with me, asked me to go get dinner one night and just chat with me and make sure I'm okay... or just ask me to see a therapist with him where he can openly share his concerns about me. 

4 - And he could have also gotten a second opinion.

5 - And the very last resort, when my dad chose to ignore the first four examples I gave of things he should have done... at the very least, he should have PREPARED and pushed himself to be very vulnerable, personable, and willing to engage in very personal conversations with me to help build trust with me and reassure me following something so traumatic. 

instead, he didn't prepare for any of that and following the psych ward, he acted like nothing had happened, didn't validate any of my feelings... never pushed himself to be a personable person... and his best way of assuring me would be me writing up a hugely personal statement basically saying:

""My son Owen (me) will never be sent to a psych ward again. He will never be forced to take medication again. Nothing with police will ever happen to him again...>"" and a lot more detailed sentences like that, and I asked my dad to respond if that statement is true and he said ""yes"".

And THAT'S IT! That's all he's ever done is saying that it's true without any personal foundation or expression... i don't even know if he values integrity after doing something so unjust and full of lies, or if he respects me. 

And on top of all this, he most recently told me that he doesn't think he's emotionally distant or hurtful, when he literally is more than any person I've ever met. 

All in all, my dad made so many severe mistakes and a parents greatest fear should be doing something that severely alters the trajectory of your child's life, and my dad did just that... 

many years have been severely altered and so many hindrances and longterm trauma arose from the psych ward, and my dad's inability to provide closure for me by personally building trust with me... and my siblings were complicit in the psych ward as well, and nobody has personally built trust with me... i suffered and had my life's trajectory completely altered for about eight years because of my dad's foolish insane decisions.

How could he make so many foolish and careless mistakes?

tl;dr my dad caused me severe ptsd due to his careless behavior and neglect",1,1757863881.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

1ngu8h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadTheories/comments/1ngu8h6/to_lose_weight_how_many_calories_should_i_consume/,To Lose Weight: How Many Calories Should I Consume?,"
Hey everyone, if you're on a journey to get healthier and shed some pounds, you're not alone. We've all been there, staring at our plates and wondering, ""To lose weight, how many calories should I consume?"" It's a question that pops up a lot in casual chats with friends or even in those online groups where folks share tips on staying fit. Today, I want to break it down in a real, straightforward way that feels like we're just chatting over coffee. Stick with me, and by the end, you might feel inspired to take that next step toward a more energized you.

# Why Calories Matter in Weight Loss

*Calories* are basically the fuel your body needs to keep going, but when it comes to losing weight, it's all about creating a balance. If you're eating more than you burn, that extra energy turns into fat storage. On the flip side, *to lose weight, how many calories should I consume* depends on your unique situation – think age, activity level, and even your metabolism. I remember when I first started paying attention to this; it was a game-changer. Getting this right isn't about starving yourself; it's about making smarter choices that leave you feeling strong and motivated. Imagine waking up with more energy to tackle your day – that's the kind of inspiration we're aiming for here.

# Calculating Your Daily Calorie Needs

Okay, let's get into the nitty-gritty. To figure out *to lose weight how many calories should I consume*, you can start with a simple formula. Experts often recommend aiming for a deficit of about 500 calories per day to lose around 1 pound a week – that's sustainable and not overwhelming. For most adults, women might need around 1,500 to 2,000 calories daily, while men could go for 2,000 to 2,500, but *adjust based on your lifestyle*. 

- Use an online calculator (there are plenty of free ones) to estimate your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and factor in your exercise.
- Track your intake for a few days to see patterns – apps make this super easy.
- Remember, quality counts: Focus on nutrient-dense foods like veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains rather than empty calories from junk.

It's not just about the numbers; it's about building habits that stick. Think of it as leveling up your daily routine – one step at a time.

# Factors That Influence Your Calorie Intake

Everyone's body is different, so *to lose weight, how many calories should I consume* isn't a one-size-fits-all answer. Your age, gender, height, and how active you are play huge roles. For instance, if you're hitting the gym regularly, you might need more calories to fuel those workouts without feeling wiped out. On the other hand, if you're desk-bound most days, you'll want to dial it back.

I've found that stress and sleep also sneak in and mess with things. Poor sleep can crank up your hunger hormones, making it tougher to stick to your plan. Here's a quick list to keep in mind:
- **Activity level**: Sedentary folks might aim lower, while active ones can go higher.
- **Age and metabolism**: As we get older, our bodies might need fewer calories, so tweak as you go.
- **Health conditions**: Things like thyroid issues can change the game, so chat with a pro if needed.

By tuning into these, you're not just counting calories – you're creating a plan that works for *you*, and that's incredibly empowering.

# Practical Tips for Cutting Calories the Smart Way

Now, how do you actually put this into practice? *To lose weight how many calories should I consume* boils down to awareness and small changes. Start by logging your food for a week; it sounds tedious, but it's eye-opening. Swap out high-calorie snacks for healthier options, like fresh fruit instead of chips, and portion your meals to avoid overeating.

Let me share a few tips that have worked wonders for me and my circle:
- *Meal prep* on Sundays to control portions and avoid last-minute bad choices.
- Stay hydrated – sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger, cutting unnecessary calories.
- Incorporate movement: Even a daily walk can burn extra calories and boost your mood.

The key is consistency, not perfection. Every small win adds up, and before you know it, you'll be feeling more confident and alive.

# Adding Natural Support to Your Routine

While focusing on calories is crucial, sometimes our bodies need a little extra help to stay on track. That's where things like a natural supplement can come in, offering support for energy and metabolism without harsh chemicals. If you're curious about exploring options, checking out details on a natural supplement could be a great next step – it's all about finding what complements your efforts safely.

In fact, many in online communities swear by these for maintaining balance. Remember, it's not a magic fix, but when combined with calorie awareness, it can make *to lose weight how many calories should I consume* feel more achievable. Always do your research and consult a professional first.

# Keeping the Momentum Going

Staying inspired is half the battle. *To lose weight, how many calories should I consume* might seem straightforward on paper, but real life throws curveballs. Share your progress with friends or in casual online groups – that accountability keeps things fun and motivating. Celebrate milestones, like fitting into an old pair of jeans, and remind yourself why you started.

I've learned that mindset is everything. Treat this as a positive journey, not a restriction, and you'll find joy in the process. You're capable of amazing things, so keep pushing forward.

# Wrapping It Up with Some Inspiration

Alright, we've covered a lot – from understanding *to lose weight how many calories should I consume* to practical steps and even a nod to natural aids. The truth is, this is your story, and you're the hero. If you're ready to dive deeper or try something new, like learning more about a natural supplement, go for it – it's a simple way to enhance your path.

I cap editing at 45 minutes; if I miss the cap, I just post the cleaned-up transcript as an email instead of a video.

I started greyrocking, and it seems to be working but I'm not sure I'm doing it right.

We still live in the same house, though have been in separate bedrooms for the past 1-2 years, since I started realizing SOMETHING is wrong and standing up for myself and my boundaries. She noticed me standing up for my boundaries, and has been trying to escalate things, picking fights about every and any little thing, trying to get me to explode and be the bad guy, I think I've read about this kind of behavior and it's called DARVO and she's been escalating more and more lately.

I make her a cup of coffee and leave it by the kettle every morning. I've been doing this for a long time.  
She recently yelled at me for not picking up the garbage the kids leave on the kitchen floor and leaving it for her. To punish me she performatively flagrantly stopped drinking the coffee I make her, leaving it untouched on the counter for me to see (it's very passive aggressive and toxic behavior) and yelled at me  ""I will NEVER drink your coffee you left be GARBAGE asshole!"".

  
She YELLED at me saying me I'm VIOLENT for insisting on making her coffee in the morning saying it's aggressive. (It's not.) When I said I don't feel comfortable talking about it without a therapist. She tried escalating and said then let's talk about it with the mediator. I didn't engage, and later answered her. ""Why do you make me coffee in the morning?” I thought about it and said” out of love and if you want to talk about it we can talk about it in therapy

It seems to be having an effect. She's trying DARVO with every opportunity trying to press my buttons, but I'm stable and calm, and it seems to be wearing her down, she's realizing it's harder when I'm not cooperative, that she still depends on me for some things, and I see it's eating her that she's not as independent as she thought. Which only makes the cold-shoulder silent treatment harder on me because she's trying to get under my skin and an advantage.

* Track your brew parameters and recipes wherever you are
* Discover new coffees while you're at the coffee shop

the basics: i’m a 34 year old woman, living solo just east of downtown toronto. employed full-time in a corporate environment. 5’9, caucasian, brown hair/blue eyes, pretty heavily tattooed. non-monogamous and child-free. i lean very hard left ideologically and will only date others with shared values. tender-hearted and sensitive but not afraid to stand up for myself or what i believe in. total stoner. sensual and fun.

interests: life’s simple pleasures, art + photography (both doing and viewing), crafting, good coffee, going on adventures with my dog, rope (iykyk), astrology, collecting books i never get around to reading, tattoos, and learning/self-growth. 

looking for: i have a pretty cool life and i'd love to find someone to share it with. i care less about what it’s labelled as and more about how it feels. i’m not drawn to the idea of a traditional life and float along the non-monogamy spectrum. i am pretty open to what that looks like in practice, though i'm not in a position to entertain couples/casual/fwb situations. also, 30+ years old only and as the title states — must be a dog person :)

DMs welcome, a thoughtful note introducing yourself will go much further! ",1,1757863289.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False
1ngu0et,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngu0et,"Retreat to the Abbey of the Transfiguration (Malaybalay, Bukidnon)","The Monastery of the Transfiguration (also known as the Abbey) is a monastery complex in Malayablay, Bukidnon, run by the Benedictine Monks. The monastery was established in 1983 and is renowned for its pyramid-like church design, which the late National Artist Leandro Locsin conceived. It has become one of the popular tourist spots in Bukidnon and is often included in itineraries by travel and tour organizers in Malaybalay. Aside from its serene atmosphere and landscape, travelers and pilgrims make a stopover at the Abbey to try to taste their signature Monk’s Blend coffee and other goods produced by the monks.

What if I tell you that you can spend a spiritual/personal retreat at the Abbey? Yes, it might be unknown to everyone, but the Abbey offers a retreat experience where religious clergy and Catholic pilgrims can have the opportunity for silent contemplation and solitude. Among the retreat places I’ve been in the Philippines, the Monastery of the Transfiguration is my favorite and go-to place. Its location, cool environment, and natural surroundings provide an ideal setting for reflecting on one's faith and vocation. A retreat at the Abbey will provide you with an experience to pray with the monks, especially when you join them during their Lauds (Morning Prayer), Morning Mass, and Vespers (Evening Prayer). Not only do you get a glimpse of their monastic life, but you also get to sing with them and listen to their Gregorian chants and hymns. If you’re planning to do a personal spiritual retreat, I highly recommend the Abbey.

To arrange for your retreat, you may contact Mr. Nicolas Obsid, the guest booking in-charge, at +639622853955. A donation of Php 1,500 (charged per pax for a twin bedroom with common/shared bathroom) or Php 1,800 (single room with private bathroom) will be requested to provide you with proper accommodation. Your accommodation already comes with 3 full meals and 2 light snacks. And the highlight of all is their free-flowing Monk’s Blend coffee. Dom. JP serves as the current guest master at the Abbey, and he will gladly help you with your concerns and can help you arrange a specialized retreat with a Benedictine monk upon request. The specialized retreat is optional, and you can still have your own personal or DIY retreat, like in my case.

To get to the Abbey in Bukidnon, fly to Laguindingan Airport (CGY) in Cagayan de Oro, then take a van to Agora Bus Terminal in Cagayan de Oro. From there, take a bus to Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, as the monastery is located in its proper area. Then take a tricycle ride from the Malaybalay bus terminal and request the driver to take you inside the Abbey (preferably at the Guesthouse). If you only wish to visit the Abbey, you may book your tour with a Bukidnon-based travel agency or tour organizers with a scheduled Bukidnon trip.

My (29M) partner's (26F) birthday is November 16th. I've always gone all out for her birthday (we're going on 5 years in December) and this year, I'm just looking for some ideas that are new and exciting. We have certain birthday traditions that we do every year (her favorite breakfast spot, walking through a cemetery, shopping spree at a Wicca stor) but I always try to find a new fun activity. Ive got a couple already but I wanna see if people have more suggestions!

Some info about her/us:

• We live in Lakewood but I have a car and can drive anywhere

• We both have been sober since we've been together

• I'm not super wealthy but not exactly on the poverty line, I have a lot of money put away for her birthday

• She is a HUGE fan of movies, mostly horror but loves anything David Lynch, Ari Aster, Yorgos Lanthimos to name a few

• She is a goth girlie and loves everything spooky. Halloween is her favorite holiday and she is essentially the embodiment of Halloween. Think Morticia Adams

• We both love dead things (taxidermy, cemeteries, ghost tours)

• She loves art and photography

• We love food, coffee, tea

• Animal lovers

• She's obsessed with Deftones, Chelsea Wolfe, Employed to Serve

That's I think the most pertinent info I can think of! Happy to answer any other questions and for anyone who offers suggestions, sincerely, thank you for helping me make it a super special day!",0,1757863172.0,Denver,17,0.5,False

1ngtt4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ngtt4o/changing_career_in_30s_when_you_dont_have_a/,Changing career in 30s when you don't have a passion for anything,"Currently find myself in what I like to call a bronze handcuffs type of situation. IT support, used to mostly deal with infrastructure support, risk management, incident management, project management, and a lot of time working as an unofficial supervisor for the role below mine. I work for one of the big companies and they keep hitting us with layoffs and larger workloads for my mostly layer 1 job because LLMs exist now.

AI to me is a bummer, it takes the passion out of everything. I used to learn more in my job and now everything is automated or escalated up. Even when dealing with things like writing up documents on outages I'm told to use AI instead of my brain. No hopes of moving up with constant hiring freezes and layoffs. You don't build much transferable skills because everything is a shit tier proprietary tool that was cranked out under an insane deadline to be launched as minimally viable product. All these tools just make my job harder and more infuriating. We managed to launch the worst possible implementation of service now for example. I have time to get a coffee while a single inventory transaction runs.

I took a lateral transfer to a help desk role because I wanted to focus on school to move into something better because I'm sick of IT support but I can't figure out what to choose. I know this is not original but my passion was sucked dry and I can't generate passion or interest for anything else. Like I'm too jaded from the reality of working for a living that I have experienced.

The grass was not greener for this move, finding I hate this role more. They combined it with their infrastructure/AV support and it is even more of a skeleton crew, so I got a worse version of what I tried to take a break from. The role is the worst of all the worlds because the workload is impossible. I can't do it all and there is only one role with no one to delegate to anymore. Help desk takes priority because it is a corp environment while the infrastructure is on fire. I was a production facing engineer, my most important job was keeping the lights on in the background which I realize now I liked way more than being customer facing. I did not mind customer facing when I thought that would be my only job to work on school though.

Soon they will have us taking phone calls too, between infrastructure support, change management reviews, 9-4 help desk, AV support, inventory management, RMA, projects deployment, desk setups, week long oncall, etc I'm losing it. Something is always behind and the prioritization is just stupid, management has no answers because higher ups want the IT workload of an entire global org to be on one teams shoulders. It's already laughably inefficient. We can't deliver on a single project deadline because all of our time is spent on a physical help desk which will soon include global calls as well. PMs are constantly calling me trying to get me to deliver while I can't break free from customer support. Multiple locations as well so I need to travel. 

I hate being the person people come to for help honestly. They are such bastards I feel like Roy from the IT crowd lol. Every-time someone comes up to my desk and tells me how their issue made their life hard like I'm their therapist, I just want to scream "" what is wrong with the computer!"". I'm so sick of supporting ungrateful rude bastards, I'm tired of being the help.

This job super sucks but I'm lucky to have it and make what I make. Obviously in my thirties I know I cannot drop a job, I can survive sometime without it but I would never do that to myself or my finances despite how miserable I am.

I wanted to be an SDE but jr devs are getting hosed with AI existing. I hate corporate america too, I'm so sick of all the bullshit in the corporate world. My most important goal is financial stability and trying my ass off to have a retirement. That goal requires that I move up and make more money but the idea of further diving into the corporate world makes me sick. I'm also tired of being stuck in this role I have been in for five years now.

I desperately want out of IT. I think I want too much, I don't want to be paged in the middle of the night, and I don't want to be the help anymore. I wish I could find something that fits my only skills. Reading comprehension and problem solving. I don't have a single cert or degree, I just figure things out.

Every \`jobs for IT people to transfer to\` list I look up just has me rolling my eyes assuming I'll hate every suggestion. Any advice for finding anything outside of this industry that might spark the slightest bit of passion while having the ability to problem solve. I feel so stuck in life and need a change desperately but have no idea where to even go. I make too much to take another IT support job, everything I can get with my credentials pays less than where I am at and it's a horrible time to be a job seeker with AI dicking us down. I don't have any interest in learning AI because removing people's ability to eat and provide for their families is not something I want to do.

I'm just tired, working for a living is not some enlightening experience like Linkedin makes it out to be and the thought that I will most likely have to keep doing it into my 70s is just so depressing.

TLDR AI and Corporate America sucked my passion dry, any advice on finding something to pivot to that will not destroy my finances?",22,1757862793.0,careeradvice,3,0.96,False

1ngts6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ngts6k/how_do_you_feel_about_the_movie_once_upon_a_time/,How do you feel about the movie Once Upon a Time In Hollywood?,"Specifically the interaction between Margarett Qually (the hippy hitchhiker) and Brad Pitt (the aging stunt man).

I’m watching the movie on a relaxed Sunday morning drinking some really good coffee out of my moka pot. And I got to the scene where Margarett Qually is flirting with Brad Pitt in his car as they are driving. And I’m of two minds. One, how my wife sees these scenes. Disgusting, appalling, vile. Basically a tacit endorsement of pedophilia. Qually’s character reveals that she’s under 18, and Brad Pitt’s character proclaims that he’s not “going to jail over some pussy”. But despite his character’s refusal of oral sex, because of legal reasons, the whole scene really sexualizes her character. And in reality she’s less than half Brad Pitt’s age. I understand why my wife rolled her eyes when we first saw the movie.

But, on the other hand. Margarett Qually is a fully grown 26-27 year old woman at the time this movie was filmed. And she is, undeniably an incredibly beautiful and charismatic actor. And I honestly find her portrayal to be really titillating. And that’s why Tarantino wrote it that way. But it leaves me feeling conflicted. 

There is something gross and dehumanizing about the way Tarantino portrays women in his later movies. It’s a remarkable shift from Kill Bill anyway. But if I’m being honest, I respond to his gross portrayals of women. I like watching beautiful charismatic actresses portraying sexualized characters. But I kind of hate myself for being such a pig. 

So, to other men out there, how do you feel about this movie, and do you feel conflicted by your feelings of being sexually titillated, and ethically conflicted at the same time? 

And for any women here, is my wife right? Am I just a pig? Are we all pigs. How would you feel about a woman in her late fifties flirting with an 18 year old man? Creeped out? Titillated? And why do I wrestle with these conflicting feelings about a fucking movie, while some men, in real life are completely oblivious of how their views could hurt women and make them feel terrible. 

TLDR: I like and hate Tarantino’s portrayal of a young sexy hitchhiker simultaneously. I am conflicted, but wonder how the men involved in writing, acting and producing the movie don’t seem to give any of this a second thought. I would be embarrassed if I wrote, directed, or played a part in this movie. ",3,1757862731.0,AskMenAdvice,8,1.0,False

1ngtqqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/1ngtqqw/my_dad_destroyed_my_best_years_and_gave_me_severe/,My dad destroyed my best years and gave me severe PTSD,"So I live in the US and grew up in an upper class suburban neighborhood, had two siblings and both parents. In simple words, my parents were very impersonal, emotionally neglectful people who showed love solely through gifts and providing for us financially.

I was a very emotion driven, sensitive boy growing up  and I deeply craved emotional connection and meaningful, personal conversations... I never received any emotional support or encouragement from my parents, never any personal conversations where they tried to get to know me on a deeper level. 

And as a result, as i got older my parents knew nothing about me on a personal level. Like I'm deeply passionate about poetry and movies, and music, and my parents, especially my dad, couldn't even tell you what my favorite movies and music are, or why. 

My mom is a bit more gentle and easier to talk to than my dad. He is much more so emotionally distant, never seen him really cry or be vulnerable. But, both of my parents are incredibly emotionally distant, impersonal people who don't know anything about me on a personal level.

Fast forward many years later and I'm in my mid 20's, back living with my parents after college, working at a coffee shop. 

Now, I had become a completely different person when i went away to college. I became a Christian in a very personal and spiritual NON-religious way. My parents and siblings didn't understand this.

A couple years later, I trusted the wrong christian mentor, and long story short it led me to walking away from opportunities in life and burning bridges with friends. I was at a school out of state, and walked away from that school to go back to living at home... lost some important friendships and didn't really have much direction in my mid 20's.

I was very influenced by this christian mentor, and she believed God personally spoke to her all the time, and even though I didn't experience that, I told my parents that God can speak to you all the time.

I also believed the world was soon to be ending and told my parents about this. This mentor believed this wholeheartedly and so did many people my age who followed her, so I believed it as well.

I didn't really have any substantial friendships around this time. I met up with a few new potential friends, some women, but they didn't go the distance. 

I was just working at this coffee shop, and when I could go home I would be in my parents basement on the computer for many hours.

I never drank alcohol or did drugs. I was physically active with riding my bike a lot. I enjoyed my job at the coffee shop and would often close up the place by myself. It was a good gig, and despite being spiritually mislead, life was going okay enough. I was never depressed or anything.

At some point around this time, knowing how much my parents misunderstood me and were somewhat concerned, I felt such a deep rush of peace on day and a deep desire to have a personal, transparent dialogue with them addressing any of their concerns...

Like I said way earlier, growing up my parents never knew much about me, and I could still tell they had lots of misunderstandings about me and i wanted to quell their fears and clear up their misunderstandings about me. I wrote a peaceful note and placed it on the kitchen table, and they never followed up with me on this, which hurt my heart. 

Here's where things took a drastic turn...

Around six or so months later, a sheriff walked into my bedroom at 4AM with my dad, to tell me that I'm going downtown to be evaluated. I got in the cop car and was driven downtown to a psych ward. 

This was scary for me, because I was VERY against psychiatry and medication, so this was scary for me. 

My parents stood before a judge and were able to convince them, with the help of a lawyer, to send me to a psych ward against my will as an adult... my dad knew i was deeply against psychiatry and would refuse this, so he had to force me this way.

There was this false report written about me that said all kinds of lies like I was depressed, had anger problems, and claimed to hear voices... NONE of which were true. 

The lawyer told my dad to stretch the truth in the most extreme way possible, and that's what he did... so me living at home and spending lots of time in the basement on the computer means i was depressed... me having one physical altercation with my dad eight years earlier, where I just pushed him and nothing happened to him, meant there was 'violence in the family""... me believing God speaks to my heart means I was ""hearing audible voices"".

and thus, doctors at this hospital quickly labeled me as a schizophrenic who also has severe anger issues, and is depressed...

my parents were also proven to have no ""ill intent"" to the judge, and that helped them accomplish sending me to a psych ward against my will as an adult.

the truth about me, is that i have never been a danger to myself or anyone else, and never have i been depressed, never heard voices... i was a healthy normal guy just in a rough patch where I didn't have really any meaningful friendships, big deal.

i stayed at the psych ward for 5 days before being released, and being deemed as having NO MENTAL ISSUES... and my parents later apologized for misunderstanding me and misjudging me... nonetheless, i suffered severe trauma from this, lots of paranoia and mental hurdles for MANY years.

My parents were still incredibly impersonal people, and failed to build trust with me so that i could feel safe and respected by them after this traumatic event.

Now, this whole psych ward thing was not my mom's decision, it was solely my dad's decision... and it blows my mind how many missteps he made. 

His whole thought process just seems incredibly careless and foolish to the highest degree...

1 - He fully knew that I was deeply against psychiatry, and that I'm also a very sensitive person... so any sane thought process when thinking about sending me to a psych ward against my will, should be the POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS of doing that to me... something like,

""I know how much my son hates psychiatry, and he is very sensitive... I'm not a very personable person and I could see him needing lots of reassurance and personal validation and expression from me to help him feel safe and build trust after this event... and I struggle with that, and I could see this becoming something that severely alters the trajectory of his life.""

Any thoughtful person should have been able to ponder those potential ramifications when considering forcing their son to a psych ward... and then immeditately decided to not do it.

2 - After pondering that, my dad should have considered some other alternate route, because he was concerned for me and wanting to make sure everything is okay.   
  


3 - He could have literally just had a personal conversation with me, asked me to go get dinner one night and just chat with me and make sure I'm okay... or just ask me to see a therapist with him where he can openly share his concerns about me. 

4 - And he could have also gotten a second opinion.

5 - And the very last resort, when my dad chose to ignore the first four examples I gave of things he should have done... at the very least, he should have PREPARED and pushed himself to be very vulnerable, personable, and willing to engage in very personal conversations with me to help build trust with me and reassure me following something so traumatic. 

instead, he didn't prepare for any of that and following the psych ward, he acted like nothing had happened, didn't validate any of my feelings... never pushed himself to be a personable person... and his best way of assuring me would be me writing up a hugely personal statement basically saying:

""My son Owen (me) will never be sent to a psych ward again. He will never be forced to take medication again. Nothing with police will ever happen to him again...>"" and a lot more detailed sentences like that, and I asked my dad to respond if that statement is true and he said ""yes"".

And THAT'S IT! That's all he's ever done is saying that it's true without any personal foundation or expression... i don't even know if he values integrity after doing something so unjust and full of lies, or if he respects me. 

And on top of all this, he most recently told me that he doesn't think he's emotionally distant or hurtful, when he literally is more than any person I've ever met. 

All in all, my dad made so many severe mistakes and a parents greatest fear should be doing something that severely alters the trajectory of your child's life, and my dad did just that... 

many years have been severely altered and so many hindrances and longterm trauma arose from the psych ward, and my dad's inability to provide closure for me by personally building trust with me... and my siblings were complicit in the psych ward as well, and nobody has personally built trust with me... i suffered and had my life's trajectory completely altered for about eight years because of my dad's foolish insane decisions.

Hello everyone! I’m Ade, and I'm back with my Into the Spiderverse-inspired Masks TTRPG that was posted roughly two months ago. We've recently had a player step away and I'd love for someone new to join us. 

**About the game:**

In this game, everyone plays a different version of Skylar Jameson, from different universes, with different powers, and different playbooks. Everyone's come from distinct worlds, each with their different quirks and inspirations. Right now, the variants have been tossed together into one of these worlds, and are navigating a rapidly deteriorating situation. 

We currently have a Brain, a Janus, a Star and a Delinquent. Apart from these, and the Outsider, there are no playbook restrictions.

This will be a more mature game, allowing for emotional depth, potentially dark subject matters, and adult relationships, but there is no explicit content in this game. That said, all players and characters must be 18+. 

The game will be played via Discord. There won’t be an enforced posting order, but I’m hoping to find players capable of posting or checking in at least once daily. All experiences welcome, as long as you’re respectful.

**About the GM:**

I'm Ade, a forever GM (happily married to my DM manuals), with a background in rules-lite PBP systems, D&D 5E, and Masks PBTA. I tend to run games where player decisions -- both IC and OOC -- impact the story and the game's direction, and I like crafting situations that carry stakes, whether social or otherwise. I usually spend my free time DMing, playing video games, goofing around with friends, and overdosing on coffee.

1ngtn7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/1ngtn7r/looking_for_input_from_all_triad_members/,Looking for Input from all triad members,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  We have been in an open adoption for 12 years with our child’s mother, their siblings, and extended family of grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. we live about 1.5 hours apart. 

Daughter is 12yo and in middle school.  We were present for birth. Mom and dad would not be allowed to parent due to past charges related to drug abuse and active drug abuse at birth. Daughter had NAS. 

First two years were lots of updates and really structured visits. We even used to take our other children and daughter to the recovery home where mom lived to visit her and older birth sibling. 

As mom got clean, dad did not get sober and they broke up. He has chosen not to take any steps to have contact with us even when we have opened the door. In recent years we have blocked him on social media (we aren’t friends but know who each other are) because he has made threats and been arrested and has a restraining order for threatening mom at times usually angry tirades in public places blaming her for her addiction and for the adoption being her fault. He clearly has unresolved grief about it all, and isn’t handling it well. 

Mom got clean, married a past boyfriend, has two younger children with husband. Got custody of older son from family back 5 years ago as he entered high school (son had a lot of law enforcement involvement but  is now seemingly doing well in first year of college).  Our daughter has been involved all along the way, updates from us via text, face time calls visits, etc. usually about once a quarter but ebbing and flowing. We have let them have trips to theme parks nearby, days together, visiting mom’s house. And against my better judgment at my daughters request, a very emotional celebration of her moms 10 years of sobriety. We follow daughters lead on inviting folks from her first family to her big events like performances, graduations, etc. mom usually comes if invited. 

Around 10 years old, our daughter started having more complex feelings. She doesnt like face time calls, reflected to her mom , and I had a discussion too that she wanted one on one time with mom not to always have her younger sibling (age 7)  to be so centered. (They have a sweet relationship and enjoy each other).  Mom disappeared for nearly a year with no visits but would respond to texts and updates and ask questions. 

Mom reconnected, explained some health issues kept her away and she was doing better   She and I had a conversation that daughter is older, she is wanting to ask lots of questions, wants less of a mom shows up and it’s a party and more of wanting to know and be known, and only wanting time with her siblings if mom has invested in their one on one relationship first.  Mom has said to me her conflicted feelings when daughter invited her to a big event and specifically said she just wanted mom no siblings. Mom  seemed to really have a hard time putting daughter first or centering her for this one event after a spectacularly hard year where daughter dealt with severe mental health issues. Self harm, suicidality, all tied to her in utero drug exposure, identities, and attachment wounds. Daughter has declined phone calls and texts on some days like birthdays if mom hasn’t otherwise been in contact. She doesn’t have access to text or call her without going through us.  But that’s true for all contacts as our daughter who doesn’t have a phone. 

Daughter did a lot of emotional work, went to mom’s recovery celebration, mom and a sibling and few others came to an event for daughter in June. Note that mom knows that the last year was hell for daughter for a lot of reasons but many of them due to trying to figure herself out with birth family and mom and dad and their varying levels of contact.  

Daughter is realizing she is not straight, maybe bi. She vacillates a lot on her gender identity,  asks lots of questions about how mom is going to respond.  She is not out to her mom or her family for fear of rejection. We are open and supportive and aware we live in a context that we also have to teach about safety. 

Since June, we’ve heard nothing from mom. Not even a how’s school, is she okay? She asked about one single date over the summer for a visit, which we had agreed monthly visits were needed and welcome. That one date didn’t work as our daughter had plans already, and if she does I don’t ask her about a visit because she cancels and then feels huge regret and guilt for wishing she’d not missed out with her friends instead of visiting with mom. I offered her other dates. Not a single text. And I haven’t initiated because I told her a few months ago that she and I have a relationship and as far as daughter, I am a facilitator for our daughter, but I won’t BE the relationship as daughter gets older as it’s not appropriate.  She has to forge a relationship there if she values it. 

Daughter hasn’t initiated any contact. I think she really is waiting to see how long it takes. Events in the last few weeks have shown me that politically and religiously we are very far apart as moms social media is public. She’s fine posting about all of siblings activities and is a public figure in her town talking frequently about her recovery and adoption. And posting how much she admired Charlie Kirk. 

Coming up in a couple of weeks is a ticketed event that daughter’s sibling invited her to back in June. No one has mentioned it since the tickets were purchased.  Do I let her go? Let her choose? Every other time I have let daughter decide the weeks following contact without lots of relationship have resulted in mental health decline, self harm, dysregulation that hasn’t been present in the past 2 months. 


My plan had been when birth mom reached out again to suggest a coffee date where I planned to discuss how we would navigate her responses to daughter’s sexuality. My daughter asked I do this. She doesn’t want to come out directly to her and be rejected. 


In all of this, I believe openness is best and I see daughter tanking when she has contact the last few years and then in and out is brutal for her.  We are all in therapy with psychiatry, lots of support. And none of our circles are navigating all these intersections. 


Will probably delete this after I get some answers just to avoid anyone figuring out the identity.

Sorry for the repost, realized I left some context out of my first post, and it's wasn't letting me edit it and I accidentally deleted it. Mods, take down this post if you must. I recieved. a phone call from my cousin and am emotional and wanted to add more detail but fucked up the edit.

So I am 28 and my sister 26. We were both raised in America, but our parents are immigrants, and when left the country 9 years ago after my sister graduated HS to retire in our home country.

My sister has has a bf, who I will call Jared. Jared was very abusive to her, and used to beat her, etc. My sister did not want to leave him(she was 19 at the time), and it was tough but I got her out of there, and we filed a restraining order against him. She was 21 when it happened. I do not think she is a stable person, and never thought so even growing up, and she is not a good relationship partner(not that she deserved Jared at that point in time). I genuinely think my parents gave her the princess treatment and spoiled her. She expects every partner to put her on a pedestal and she can do no wrong.

Anyway, when she was 22, she wanted to date my best friend, Mark. I told her to leave him alone, and told Mark he could do better, to be perfectly honest. But she pestered him and me, and Mark, said since I am his homie, my sister cannot be that bad and I may be biased. Warned the dude, but Mark and my sister got together, and were in a relationship for 18 months. She cheated on Mark and went back to Jared. Her excuse for cheating attacked some physical insecurities Mark had. 

I was very disappointed, and told her that if she went to the guy that beat her, I would never help her again, cuz getting her outta that situation was hell. And she cheated on a perfectly good guy and broke him in the process. I told her she can break up with Mark, whatever, I think it was a mistake and she did it in a terrible way, but she cannot have a relationship with me if she wants to be with a dude that literally abused her. She chose Jared, cuz ""he changed"". I cut her off entirely.

Mark is a homie, and he turned to alcoholism, but therapy got him out of it. It's been 2 years, Mark still struggles with insecurity. He has never once held it against me thought, and encouraged me to not let go of a family bond for his sake, but I made the choice. I see the dude, my homie who took care of my dad when I wasn't there by his side for a surgery recovery, a man I consider a brother, struggle to this day because of her. 

He has not been on a single date cuz of the way she attacked his insecurities and cheated on him. It make's me seethe when I think about the way she treated him. Worst part is he did everything right. Remember all the anniversaries, gifts, cooked for her and paid the bills, while she did nothing. Planned a family with her. She threw it all away like dropping a glass vase and left him shattered. I am forever grateful he didn't judge me for her actions, cuz if a woman treated me that way, I don't know if I could ever look anyone related to her in the eye again.

Anyway, around last week, lo and behold, Jared was being abusive to her, and my parents called me and begged me to help her. She has nowhere to go, and she should crash at my house. I said no, hung up, and haven't picked up my parents phone call either. Today, my sister showed up at my fucking workplace. She had a black eye, bruises everywhere, cuts, etc. It was a horrible sight to behold to be honest, I almost felt like throwing up seeing her like that. She then made a scene begging me to take her home to my house. I looked like an asshole to everybody at my work place. She was begging me not to abandon her, and that ""you are the only family in this country"" that she has.

I took her outside and tried to calm her down. But, ultimately, I told her she is not staying with me. She started making a scene, falling to the ground and clasping my leg. I kinda lost it and started anger crying here, in the parking lot, where people could see me from work. I told her to fuck off, and that I would call the cops on her and ask the building to get her trespassed(idk, if I could I was bluffing here). 

I fucking left her there, and turned around. She walked away on her own, idk where she went, after 10-15 minutes. Awkward ass situation she put me in and I had to explain at work. They all think I am the asshole for not helping her out, but my boss knows my situation. My boss is Marks cousin, he was the connection that got me the job.

Of course, I am asshole to people at work, and to people in my family. My parents want to remove me from the will for leaving her bruised and not helping her in a parking lot. Cool, they can go ahead and do that, not like I need anything from them. My female cousin all think I am a monster. My other cousin, a dude, lives in Canada. He is preparing to come down here to help her. 

But he is not in Canada right now, the earliest she can get help from him is a week from now. My mom and dad are recovering from something and are under strict orders not to travel, but they want to break that and travel anyway. We will see. Anyway, my cousin, he called me a few minutes ago and blasted me for being a POS, and said I can't let my sister suffer like this. None of these fuckers know what I have been through.

I have TMJ from getting my jaw decked by Jared. I can't fix it with botox, I need invasive surgery if it gets worse. He showed up to my previous place of employment when I took my sister in the first time, and made a scene that isolated me socially. I risked everything had to threaten him with a weapon once; if he called the cops on me, I could've jeopardized my career with something. She ruined my best friend, after I begged her not to go after the guy. And, after all of it, she still chose him. Fuck me and everything I did for her. 

I was 23 years old, I was fucking scared too. Jared is 2 years older than me. My parents fucked off and let me handle everything, just occasionally visiting her. I don't consider her family anymore. I don't want to help her. Idk what to do. I don't understand how my family or anyone can think I am in the wrong here. And it may seem brutal, but after everything, she can sleep in the bed she made. I know it's not right, but I feel like she has brought this on herself. Just cuz I am her older brother, I am tired of being expected to deal with a literal fucking criminal.

So, I know I am coming on here for validation, and would appreciate validation. But, I think I just need to know it straight. Am I in the wrong here?

She is a perfect candidate for a battered women's shelter (a lot of times they won't take people in unless they are being abused, well, she clearly, visibly is). The question you need to ask yourself is, if something terrible happened to her, would you be able to forgive yourself? I don't say this to manipulate or guilt you, but to ask you to sit for a bit and process and think, about the worst case for her and how you'd feel, and the worst case for you if you do decide to help.

# **Update - 2 days later**

[**(Update) AITAH for not wanting to help my sister with her abusive relationship this time**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n95o5n/update_aitah_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_sister/) 

So the events in the previous post occurred 2-3 ish days ago, and some stuff has happened since then and since I posted it as well. First of all, thank you for the people who understood what it was like and told me I shouldn’t have to clean up after another adult. That was so validating to hear. I know the tide changed a bit after, but I’m putting myself first for the first time in my life.

Some clarification first; just cuz Mark’s cousin is my boss doesn’t mean I can slack. Mark’s cousin connection helped me land a stage 1 interview. I had to go through 3-4 rounds of the interview process like every other applicant. It’s just that the company usually hires internally for my position, but I was able to come in externally cuz of Marks cousin. I only got the job after the guy they initially hired jumped ship for a better job at another company. Idk why people assumed I can skate by at my job. Plus Mark and his cousin aren’t tight, and his cousin is straight laced and direct to the point.

So after the fiasco at my workplace, where I gotta make a living, I’m chill with the security guards. As per my boss’(Marks cousin) suggestion, I handed the photos of my sister and her description to building security so that they can make sure I don’t get harassed next time, and they can threaten legal action and trespassing if she doesn’t heed to warnings of not crossing into private property.

I live in a gated apartment community, so I followed through with the same thing with the leasing/security office for them. Sure enough, the next day, she tried showing up to my apartment complex and using my code to scan in(I gave my code to my parents just in case they visit, they must’ve leaked it to her). She was escorted away, but she must’ve thought she could’ve just waited at the door. 

Unfortunately, was hard to hear, but she was kicking and screaming and begging them to call “her brother” and that I “still love her for sure”. Oh man it fucking hurt to hear. Did a number on me. Suffice to say, this blew up even more in the family group chat. “You got security to chase away your sister”, etc. I’m legit getting threats. My mother sent me a long ass text about how she should’ve aborted me, or prayed for a fucking miscarriage lol. One minute they’re angry I’m ignoring their calls, next minute I deserve to have never been born. And somehow, I’m the bad guy still btw.

Anyway, Mark didn’t know about any of this. She showed up to his workplace the same day she came to my apartment. Mark was respectful but said he couldn’t help her due to his mental health. He said he would try to talk to me. And yeah, he talked to me and told me if I’m “punishing” her for what she did to him, it’s not needed and I should just help my sister out. I kinda broke down and cried(yeah, yeah, I know) and told him it’s not that it’s just me putting myself first. I’m tired of having to be the one to clean up after her mess always. He understood.

As for my cousin who was supposed to come to help her; lo and behold guess who “suddenly got some work” when he realized he would have to provide financial support or a place to stay for her? That’s right, the guy who criticized me for not helping has ghosted the family!

My dad is not able to visit due to some reasons, and my mom, unknown to me guess they never wanted to mention it, is actually immobilized in her leg from a partial stroke or something(idk what it is, I just know it’s something). She can’t come cuz she can’t move and can’t afford to miss PT sessions. Had to find out through a second fucking cousin, who also called to berate me. So it’s hinging on my dad now, who’s also old and unable to travel cuz of some paperwork issue or something(once again I’m not being kept in the loop here).

I feel horrible about all of this. I hate Jared and hope he’s brought to justice, but I am in line for a promotion at work, I may be able to get my dream role. I’m putting in extra hours. I can’t afford to throw away my life or endanger everything I built for her again. Cuz even if I throw everything away to help her, I can live with it if she’s fine. But she may just go back to that fuck again. I’m putting myself first.

My friends have been shocked, but supportive. Only they get me since they saw the initial nuclear fallout I had to deal with. When(cuz it’s not an if anymore) my family cuts me off, so be it. I’m okay without them. They’ve done nothing but make me a scapegoat for all their issues(beyond this too) their entire life. I hate those parasites.

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent guys and sorry for not having a more positive update. Hopefully my last update on the situation. I wanna just live my life and focus on myself.

Idk why she thought dragging my name in front of them would help her in anyway, when I’ve exceeded her quarterlies by a minimum of 17% every quarter, since I’ve joined. She’s older than me and has worked longer than me, so I figured she would understand how soulless and ruthless corporate is about caring about results only, so I’m not sure what her move was.*

No point is engaging in drama trying to clear my name now, imo. As long as the people in charge of the decision know the truth I’m okay with it.*

>NTA you helped her once even though it put you in danger. It’s hard to help people in abusive relationships especially when you are put in danger and there is a chance they could go back to the abuser again. It’s a difficult situation but she needs to file a police report and seek assistance from an abuse organisation.

I don’t think she will ever leave him tbh, and when Mark told me that, it kinda sealed the deal for my slightly wavering mind.*

# **Final Update - 7 days later (5 days from the last post)**

[**(Update 2) AITAH for not wanting to help my sister with her abusive relationship this time**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ndiri1/update_2_aitah_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_sister/) 

I’m a bit numb. I didn’t think I would make another update, but things have happened. On Sunday, all I know is or heard from family was that my sister went back to Jared and worked things out and didn’t need help.

Last night, Jared’s sister, who is also my sisters “bff”(I put it in quotes cuz no real bff would allow their friend to stay with an abusive partner even if it’s their brother), showed up randomly. She was cordial and said “things have changed” and that my sister sent her.

Long story short, unknown to my family and I, Jared had been cheating on my sister(repeatedly, and yeah, what a shock totally out of character). She was disappointed and he denied it. She had the smart idea that getting off birth control, lying to Jared, and baby trapping him would “fix” their relationship. The reason she was trying to get away from Jared and didn’t want the police involved was that she wanted to tell him in a safe space and “go back” after he calmed down. He was beating her cuz he didn’t know why she was trying to leave.

Well, she ended up telling him on Sunday in the presence of Jared’s sister, and he surprisingly didn’t get mad and hugged her and said “it doesn’t matter I’ve always wanted a family” and promised to “change for their little miracle”. My sister also sent a letter with Jared’s sister confirming everything. She wants me to be their “little miracle’s” godfather. A letter from Jared too, apologizing for the past, and to forgive the “dad of my nephew or niece” and be “one family with them”(deadbeat thinks I’ll hand over cash, I suspect). I sent Jared’s sister out, in a nice and respectful manner and told her I would contact my sister when I felt like it.

I sat down to process this news and called my family, after unblocking them. Two hour conversation with my dad and the biggest worry for him was something along this: “that kid will be [slur for an illegitimate kid] if it’s born like this, and taint our bloodline; I’m coming over and getting them married, so that we don’t have to dishonor our lineage”. No mention that she’s having a kid with an abusive POS and she doesn’t work and Jared can’t hold down a job. When I mentioned that, he said: “it’s okay I can send money. Whatever happened, too late now, help me fix it instead of being pessimistic”. Of course, they’ll pay for their angel and their angles grandkid.

I’m totally numb. I feel like the only sane person. Apparently Jared said “I hope she’s a daughter who looks like her mom”, and it made my sister swoon. I’m in fucking shock. These assholes are bringing life into the world like it’s nothing. I’m not a religious person, but I do consider the act of bringing life into the world as sacred and not something done so callously. My sister’s inability to protect herself was one thing; but knowingly bringing in a kid to be raised in that FUCKING TOXIC environment? I have lost ALL RESPECT for her. It’s fucking insane!

And my family doesn’t give a shit! They don’t care if their grandkid is abused as long as that grandkid is legitimate! What the actual fuck is wrong with these people man!

I told my friends(Mark and the others). I took off work today to sit down and process this shit. It’s one thing when she makes mistakes and I get dragged into it. She’s not understanding her craziness is going to impact an innocent fucking child that didn’t ask to be born into this shit. I’m so goddamn clueless, idk what to do.

When I told my folks they said “well she doesn’t want to abort it or anything, are you willing to take care of your nephew/niece”. No man I don’t wanna take care of the kid cuz I got my own life, but I also don’t think that bars me from criticizing her choices, what the actual FUCK. They can’t raise the kid either cuz they’re a bunch of old fucks.

I just wanting to get this off my fucking chest. I know I cussed a lot, I apologize. I’m dealing with the fact that reality is presenting me a nephew/niece who’s gonna be born to grandparents that value the kids legitimacy over the kids life, a mom that’s obsessed with its dad, an abusive dead beat dad, and an uncle that doesn’t know how to, and probably might not be able to help, especially if I move for work( and the fact I’ve never wanted kids to begin with).

1ngtkzq,https://i.redd.it/gsbhujtxa5pf1.png,DIVERSIONS -- Part I - The Man Who Wasn't There,"The first lie Stencil told Elizabeth was that he had a meeting.

He said it the way normal men said they were going to the gym: apologetic without remorse, half a promise to make it up to her, half an invitation for her to say it was fine. She was painting her toenails a militant red on the edge of the bathtub, the bathroom fan warbling like a tired insect. Through the apartment’s thin window the Cleveland wind moved the branches and the branches moved the shadows and the shadows moved Stencil, who was already moving before he understood why.

“A meeting,” she repeated, not looking up from the wet sheen of color. “At nine p.m.”

“They’re London,” he said. “Different clock.”

She capped the bottle with a dry click, and the sound was the second lie revealed: the lie that she didn’t care. She always capped things like that when she cared too much. He kissed her temple—she smelled like lemon soap and coffee, a neat combination—and she let him, and when his mouth hovered a second too long she tilted her head away with surgical gentleness. The battlefield had already been chosen and there would be no heroics here.

“Where?” she asked.

“Downtown,” he said, which at least rhymed with something like true. Then he left as if he’d merely be back with milk, the door closing behind him with a hush instead of a slam because that’s how doors close when two people still hope they’re not leaving.

Outside, February did the thing it did best: it made everyone honest by making everyone cold. Stencil walked fast without appearing to hurry, hands in the pockets of a charcoal coat that had a hidden pocket inside the hidden pocket. At East Ninth he angled south, then west, then south again—spiraling across the grid like a man too cautious for direct lines—until he reached a brick building that looked like it wanted privacy. There was a light in one window and it wasn’t on the first floor.

No one followed him. He checked anyway, not because anyone was there but because habit is the religion of men who live without one.

The stairwell smelled of damp paper and unresolved arguments. He climbed two floors and opened a door marked with nothing. The room beyond was bare enough to look intentional. A folding table. Two chairs. A metal thermos. A laugh that wasn’t friendly and wasn’t hostile; it belonged to the man already seated, brown-skinned and precise, eyes like inches.

“Late,” Haresh said.

“I’m on time,” Stencil answered, which was also true. Haresh’s clock kept a more aggressive kind of accuracy.

“Sit,” Haresh said. “We’ll walk.”

Stencil sat. Haresh rose. The dance had begun.

“Tell me the word,” Haresh said as they crossed the dark office to the darker window. Below, Euclid Avenue was the city’s idea of a river—constant in motion, inconsistent in purpose. “We need to be careful how we name things now.”

“‘Diversion,’” Stencil said.

Haresh smiled the way a locksmith smiles at a complicated door. “And what are you not?”

“I am not an assassin. I don’t deliver endings. I only start stories that end themselves.”

“And those stories,” Haresh said, “tend to end in funerals.”

“Funerals happen on their own,” Stencil said, and he wasn’t being philosophical. He was making a small place to stand.

Haresh handed him a manila envelope heavy enough to prove it was real. Inside: a passport, a ticket stub, photographs that looked like they weren’t photographs. The man in them was neither handsome nor remarkable. That was the point.

“Paris,” Haresh said. “Then a hop you won’t like.”

“Tehran,” Stencil said, and watched Haresh’s face for the tell. It came—a fractional flicker—a soldier’s respect for a man who guessed the battlefield from the weather.

“Tehran,” Haresh confirmed. “But not in that order.”

He poured coffee from the thermos into two paper cups. Stencil didn’t drink his. He was saving appetites for later.

“The thing in Paris,” Haresh said, “isn’t a thing until you touch it. You touch it, it becomes the thing. You leave, and the thing does what things do.”

“Multiply,” Stencil said.

“Escalate,” Haresh said. “Our mutual friend in London needs plausible deniability. We offer him implausible deniability instead. It’s a premium product, very chic right now.”

Stencil brushed a thumb over the edge of the top photograph. A woman: mid-thirties, hair pulled back with a budget hair tie, the long face of a person who had been told truths that didn’t make her free. Behind her—blurred by the telephoto’s shallow depth—a mural of a blue bird that should have looked hopeful but didn’t.

“Who?” he asked.

Haresh observed him the way hunters observe wind. “You won’t meet her. You’ll meet the man she believes in. Williams.”

The name ran through Stencil like a rumor you don’t repeat because you know it’s true. Williams was that kind of man: not where he was supposed to be, not when, not how. He built pockets of gravity around himself and then watched to see what fell in.

“What’s the objective?” Stencil asked.

“Not to stop anything,” Haresh said, offended by the notion. “We’re not policemen, we’re meteorologists. You seed the cloud. Rain happens. Merely be an instrument.”

“Of weather,” Stencil said. “Right.”

Haresh handed him a folded paper map for a city Stencil could navigate by smell. The lines were the true map; the paper was just a memory of an era when people trusted things they could hold.

“Elizabeth,” Haresh said—too casually for it to be casual.

“What about her,” Stencil said without punctuation.

“You left her painting,” Haresh said. “It’s admirable to leave art in the world when you go to make a dent in it.”

“Don’t,” Stencil said, and the word felt heavier than any he’d lifted in weeks.

Haresh raised his hands in the blessed innocence of men who only move chess pieces. “We’ll keep her safe,” he said, and Stencil believed him—not because Haresh kept promises but because Haresh kept assets, and Elizabeth, without knowing it, had become one of those.

The meeting ended the way efficient things do: abruptly, without procession. When Stencil stepped back into the cold, the city had changed because he had changed. That was how it worked with him. He never altered the present; he dislodged the future.

Paris smelled like wet stone and cigarettes and nostalgia that didn’t belong to you. Stencil arrived at Charles de Gaulle like a man who knew where the exits were in three dimensions. He wore a suit that would look out of place anywhere and therefore looked appropriate everywhere. In the cab, he watched the gray halo of the périphérique and thought about Elizabeth’s toes drying into battle.

His phone vibrated once: a number that wasn’t a number.

Williams called himself R. to people who wanted to believe they were knowing him. “You’re early,” R. said, and the softness of his voice carried like a blade wrapped in velvet.

“On time,” Stencil said.

“Early,” R. insisted, which meant that R. had chosen the clock. “Meet me at the church that is receding.”

“Saint-Sulpice,” Stencil said, because there was a painting there that was always leaving.

“Clever,” R. said, and hung up.

Saint-Sulpice was the right place to stage an unmiracle. The light came in from an angle that made everyone look like a confession. Stencil stood near the gnomon—a brass strip in the floor that promised astronomy but delivered fate—and waited without waiting.

R. approached without approaching, and then he was there. He had the manner of a colonel who became a barista because it was more challenging. Forty-something. Polished shoes. A gray scarf an expensive brand had tried to convince the world was humility. His hands were empty in the way skilled hands are empty: you could imagine tools in them.

“Stencil,” R. said. “You look like a man who leaves rooms just before a bomb goes off.”

“I look like a man who checks the fire exits,” Stencil said.

R. smiled with at least two meanings. “Walk with me,” he said, and they did, out of the church, into a street where noon was debating whether to be beautiful.

“Haresh speaks highly,” R. said. “That almost makes me nervous.”

“That’s the effect he goes for,” Stencil said. “Nearly an emotion.”

“I have one for you,” R. said, and handed him a postcard of a blue bird whose eye had been scratched out with something too sharp for fingernails. On the back, a name and an address in a quarter that liked being called emerging.

“She believes she’s organizing a meeting,” R. said. “She is correcting history. What she is doing is inviting tragedy to a table with candles. We do not need to stop her. We need only to make certain that when the candles go out, the darkness benefits us more than others.”

Stencil put the postcard in a pocket that didn’t exist. “What’s at the address?” he asked.

“A painter who thinks she is a historian,” R. said. “Or a historian who thinks she is a painter. I can never keep the difference straight. She makes people remember things they didn’t live. People like that are dangerous because they give shape to grief.”

“And grief needs shape,” Stencil said, surprising himself by saying it aloud.

“For citizens,” R. said. “Not for us. For us, grief is lightning. We want it to strike where we’ve set the rods.”

They crossed a small square where the trees had been instructed to be picturesque. Stencil measured the faces around him, the hands in pockets, the bags that were too heavy for what they should have carried. He let the city enter him the way you let language enter you—in the ear even when you’re not listening.

“Your other stop,” R. said, as if picking up a conversation he’d begun years earlier. “Tehran. You will not like who you meet there, and he will like you too quickly for your comfort. Tell him what you will not do, and he will ask you to do something worse. Do that instead.”

“You didn’t have to say it,” Stencil said.

“I did,” R. said. “Because you’re the only man I know who hears the word ‘no’ as an invitation.”

They parted before the river because rivers have long memories and Stencil tried to reduce his footprint in every medium. He spent an hour in a café sitting at a table no one wanted, then another hour walking toward a neighborhood that had decided it needed a new name so tourists could feel adventurous buying bread there.

The address on the postcard was an apartment above a closed bakery whose window advertised a kind of cake that made no promises. Stencil climbed the narrow stairs and knocked with the rhythm of a courtesy. A woman opened. It was the woman from the photograph: the elegant fatigue, the blue bird that wasn’t hopeful, the hair tie that declared war on funding.

“Oui?” she said.

“I’m here to talk about the mural,” Stencil said in French. “The last one you painted before they stopped you from finishing.”

Her eyes sharpened, then softened, an animal evaluating a sound’s lineage. “You are the man from the church,” she said.

“I’m the man from everywhere,” Stencil said. “May I?”

She stepped aside. The apartment was a drafting table that had learned to sleep. Canvases leaned like tired soldiers. Coffee cups multiplied toward the sink. On the wall, a charcoal sketch of a bird with arrows in its wings that somehow looked victorious.

“I was told you were a historian,” Stencil said.

“I’m a painter,” she answered. “But I paint things that happened. That makes some people uncomfortable.”

“What do you call that?” he asked, pointing at the bird.

“An omen I don’t believe in,” she said, and smiled with a courage that should have had better allies. “And what do I call you?”

“Jacques,” he said, and felt the name settle like a coat he wasn’t sure fit. “A friend of a friend. I came to buy a painting.”

Her laugh was not the laugh of a person who had sold many things. “Which one?”

“The one you shouldn’t sell,” he said. “The one someone will come for if you don’t let me move it first.”

She watched him like a street cat deciding whether a hand holds food or foolishness. “Who sent you?” she asked.

“The part of the world that doesn’t like other parts of the world deciding what people remember,” he said. “I’m here to make sure memory doesn’t become a weapon with your fingerprints.”

“That sounds like a threat,” she said.

“It is a promise,” he said. “Threats you can refuse. Promises are much harder.”

She turned away because she needed to think, and he let her because he needed to map the room in the absence of her eyes. There was a door to a small balcony that faced an alley where men smoked their intentions. A closet that was not a closet. A painting wrapped in brown paper too carefully to be casual.

“Jacques,” she said finally. “If I sold you anything, I would need a receipt.”

“You’ll have a receipt,” he said. “The kind that doesn’t exist until it needs to.”

She almost laughed again; instead she stepped to the painting wrapped too carefully to be casual. “It is because of this,” she said, “that people have been polite to me in the way people are polite when they are deciding whether to hurt you.”

She ripped the paper in a single steady motion.

The painting was of a street most people never visited but recognized anyway: a line of men whose faces the artist had refused to focus, a woman holding a birdcage open, a child watching the bird decide. In the background, a van with an emblem that used to belong to a security company and now belonged to an idea.

Stencil leaned closer. The child wasn’t watching the bird. The child was watching the woman’s hands. It was a painting of attention disguised as a painting of escape.

“How much,” he asked.

“Enough to move me,” she said. “Enough to make me new.”

Stencil thought about money the way cartographers think about distance. He named a number that would pass a lie detector and still embarrass a banker. She didn’t flinch. Neither did he. The deal wasn’t money; it was gravity.

“Someone is coming,” she said, “aren’t they?”

“Everyone is coming,” he said. “But some faster than others.”

Her phone buzzed on the table like a bug that had more to say. She didn’t pick it up. He did. A single message from a number not dressed for public: **OPEN BALCONY. NOW.**

Stencil looked at the balcony door. He didn’t move toward it. He moved toward the light switch and turned the room into a lesson.

“Put your coat on,” he said. “Take nothing you can live without.”

“I can live without everything,” she said, and meant it in the way artists sometimes do.

“Not today,” he said.

He reached for the painting. He didn’t want it under his arm in a hallway where someone might call it theft. He wanted it to stop being a painting and start being a shape. He slit the canvas free, rolled it into a new kind of risk, slid it into a plain tube leaning in a corner that had been waiting for this second its entire manufactured life.

The balcony door creaked on old arguments. When he opened it, the alley air was the temperature of decision. He stepped out.

A man stood in the shadow between a dumpster and a lamppost. He wore a coat the color of bureaucracy and a hat that had decided decades earlier that fashion wasn’t a democracy. He wasn’t looking up. He was looking at the alley entrance where a motorbike idled with an impatience that would soon be mistaken for courage.

Stencil stepped back into the room. “We don’t use the front,” he said. “Or the back. We use the neighbor’s ceiling.”

He knocked once on the floor with the handle of his umbrella—he had not had an umbrella when he entered; it had been folded into the coat’s lining. The sound that returned from beneath was hollow in the particular way of rooms with no one in them. The ceiling had a patch that had not been painted as well as the rest.

“You’re going to ruin her security deposit,” the painter said.

“She won’t need to sue for it,” Stencil said, and pushed the patch until it gave. A rectangle of plaster sagged like a tired lid. He slid through. The girl followed, nimble with terror. He pulled the patch back into place, and in the silence that followed they could hear the balcony door open in the room they had left.

The empty apartment below was an inventory of absence. He led her through it to a hall that smelled like a vacuum cleaner used religiously. They walked fast without sounding hurried, and when they reached the street they were just two people in a city full of people and that was the safest camouflage in the world.

At the corner, Stencil traded the umbrella for a bus ticket he had purchased hours earlier because paranoia is wasted only on men without imagination. The bus stank of humanity and hope. He guided her to seats in the back where willpower goes to think.

“What now,” she asked, in the voice of a student who knows the answer but wants to hear the teacher say it.

“Now we mail your painting to a country where paintings get forgotten aboard ships,” Stencil said. “And you go to a hotel under a name that will make the clerk smile because it sounds like a celebrity with a cold. And then you wait until the story that should have included you unfolds without you, and when it’s over, you surface as a woman who resents how quiet her life is.”

She looked at him like a woman who resents quiet. “Who are you?”

“Jacques,” he said again, and the name smiled without teeth.

The bus let them out near a post office that pretended to be modern. He addressed the tube with a slanted print that would survive lawyers and rain. When the clerk asked about insurance, Stencil declined politely. The act of not insuring something is a signal to certain kinds of thieves that the item is priceless. He wanted those kinds of thieves busy with other doors.

They were three blocks from the post office when a small car made a mistake close enough to God to pass for a miracle. It hopped the curb with the confidence of a trained dog and stopped exactly where the painter would have been if she had not paused to adjust the strap of her bag. The driver’s window slid down. The man inside was no one, which told Stencil everything. The gun was clean and the hand that held it had never done art.

Stencil moved with the simple geometry of survival. He took the painter by the back of her coat and introduced her to the ground. The shot took the air where her belief had been. The second shot said the first had been sincere. The bus they had left earlier cut the corner in a way that gave them a shadow, and shadows are old friends to people who need new ones. Stencil pulled her the wrong way down a one-way street because morality seldom travels with traffic.

By the time the car had corrected from its surprise, they were in a doorway that had once sold keys. Stencil worked the deadbolt with a piece of metal that believed in him. Inside, the smell of iron and coffee shook hands.

“This is where?” she whispered, half-laughing, half-bleeding from a cut she didn’t remember earning.

“A friend,” he said. He meant a man who owed him a quiet. He meant an idea.

The back room contained a safe that had never stored anything worth stealing and therefore had never been opened by anyone who didn’t know. Stencil spun it without looking. When it clicked, he felt the logic of the city line up.

Inside: a small bag with smaller bags in it. Documents like the truth’s understudies. Money folded by a different century’s fingers. Two phones that weren’t phones until they were turned on in three specific neighborhoods. He handed the painter a passport with her picture taken by a camera she had never met.

“You planned this,” she said.

“I plan a lot of things,” he said. “Most of them never happen. That’s how luck is hired.”

He pressed gauze to her forehead and realized he was angrier than he should have been. Not at the men in the car. At himself. He had left Elizabeth painting and told a lie so casual it had sounded like a kindness. He had stepped into a city where he could end who he was and begin someone else because that was his trick. And then a bullet had reminded him that tricks aren’t infinite.

The phone he didn’t turn on rang in his pocket. That meant Williams had decided the plot was behind schedule, which meant Williams had built the schedule for this call all along. Stencil answered without speaking because words are valuable and silence is currency.

“You lost the car,” Williams said, approving.

“I didn’t lose it,” Stencil said. “It misplaced me.”

“I’m told you have my painting,” Williams said, and the pronoun was a flag on a hill he hadn’t even climbed yet.

“I have a painting,” Stencil said.

“Good,” Williams said. “Because the one in Tehran is about to change hands, and the hand it changes into will shake the world in a way that exhausts news presenters.”

“I don’t do Tehran for free,” Stencil said.

“You don’t do Tehran at all,” Williams corrected. “You do Mashhad. Then someone drives you where you don’t go. There you perform your specialty.”

“The thing with candles,” Stencil said.

“The thing with matches,” Williams said. “The candles are extra.”

“And the woman?” Stencil asked, looking at the painter, who had found a mirror and was regarding her new passport with the expression women have when they realize they’ve finally been seen clearly by a lens.

“She is a river,” Williams said. “You do not dam rivers. You redirect them to fields you wish to irrigate. In your case, you clear a channel and let gravity be your accomplice.”

“And if I decide I’m not your water engineer?” Stencil asked.

“You won’t,” Williams said, “because Haresh has your favorite thing and does not realize it. A mercy.”

The call ended, not with a click but with the absence of one, as if the line had decided to be alone. Stencil looked at the painter. She looked at him like a person who understood she had become plot.

“You’ll be safe,” he said.

“No,” she said. “But safer, perhaps.”

He gave her the hotel name and the name to give and a sentence to say if a man with a particular tie asked a question in a particular way. He walked her to the door and then back again because leaving has rules. Finally he left and she didn’t follow because staying has rules too, and some people obey them without believing in them.

On the street, Paris had decided to reward survival with afternoon. Stencil stepped into it, and it closed over him as if it had been waiting for the exact shape of this man to complete it.

His phone buzzed again. A message from an American number that wasn’t Elizabeth’s and therefore had more power to hurt him. It said only: **CLEVELAND. TONIGHT. DOOR. OPEN.**

It came with a photograph. His own apartment door, slightly ajar. Not smashed. Invited.

Elizabeth’s militant red toes, visible on the bath mat in the corner of the frame like a signature the photographer hadn’t meant to include.

Stencil stopped walking. The city did not, because cities are indifferent to the personal. He felt the precise shape of a choice lower itself onto his chest like a careful weightlifter.

He could fly east, where the plan was already designed to survive him. Or he could fly west, where there was no plan but there was Elizabeth.

A third option presented itself, wretched and clean: do both, ruin both.

He looked up; a gull hovered like a bad omen trying to be useful. He looked down; the message sat on his screen like a grin with too many teeth.

He typed three words to Haresh and didn’t send them. He typed three different words to Elizabeth and deleted them. Then he called a number he never called and listened to it ring across water and anger.

Williams answered. “Yes?”

“I want proof she’s alive,” Stencil said.

“That’s not my department,” Williams said.

“Everything is your department,” Stencil said. “That’s your problem.”

Williams paused, as if consulting a book he didn’t want to open but knew exactly where it lived. “You will have proof,” he said. “But the price is punctuality.”

“When,” Stencil asked.

“Tehran,” Williams said. “If you’re late, love dies on time.”

Stencil closed his eyes. When he opened them the gull was gone and the sky had decided to be gray, because why not be honest.

He bought a ticket he couldn’t afford with a card that didn’t exist. He walked toward the airport because walking had always been his way of telling the world he could keep up.

Across the river, a siren rehearsed its scales. In Cleveland, a door stayed open a fraction wider. In Tehran, someone lit a match and waited to see if the room agreed.

And Stencil, who was not an assassin, stepped into the space between two catastrophes and chose to be the kind of man who believed—just once—that a diversion could also be a rescue.

1ngtiil,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1ngtiil/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_cuisinart/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle Cuisinart GK-1 or Skip It,"Testing out the Cuisinart GK-1 Digital Gooseneck Kettle has been an interesting journey. This electric kettle caught my attention with its sleek, matte black stainless steel design and ergonomic handle. At first glance, it’s clear this isn’t just any ordinary kettle. As someone who enjoys crafting pour-over coffee and experimenting with different teas, I was eager to see if this kettle could step up to the challenge. The promise of precise temperature control and the unique gooseneck spout had me intrigued, and I was curious to find out whether it could really deliver on its claims.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The visual appeal of this kettle cannot be overstated. Its matte black stainless steel finish gives it a polished look, fitting perfectly into my modern kitchen aesthetic. The handle is comfortable to grip and remains cool even after extended use, which is a big plus because I’ve burned my fingers enough times on poorly designed kettles. Weighing just one pound, it’s surprisingly lightweight, and the compact dimensions (11.81""L x 5.55""W x 6.93""H) make it a space-saver on the kitchen counter. The construction quality feels sturdy, and the stainless steel body adds a touch of durability. It’s not just attractive—it feels like a well-engineered device.

**Ease of Use**  
One of the standout features is the one-touch control system and the 30-minute ""keep warm"" option. It’s ridiculously easy to use, especially on groggy mornings when I just want my coffee. The control pad and digital temperature display are intuitive, allowing me to choose a precise temperature between 140°F and 212°F with ease. Whether I’m preparing delicate green tea or boiling water for a perfectly extracted pour-over coffee, the adjustable controls ensure I get it right every time. Not having to guess the water temperature is a game changer, and I’ve noticed an improvement in the consistency of my drinks.

**Advantages**  
- Precision gooseneck spout ensures a steady, controlled pour.  
- Adjustable temperature control enables brewing teas or coffee at optimal heat levels.  
- Lightweight and compact, making it perfect for smaller kitchens.

The ""keep warm"" function was also a pleasant surprise. There were mornings when I wasn’t quite ready to drink my tea immediately, and the kettle saved me from boiling water over and over again. The matte finish of the exterior also proved to be smudge-resistant, which is great because fingerprints drive me absolutely crazy. Cleaning it is simple—just a quick hand wash—and there’s no worry about rust thanks to the stainless steel construction.

**Performance Evaluation**  
In terms of performance, this kettle heats up water quickly, thanks to its 1200-watt power. Even with a full 1-liter capacity, the wait for boiling water was shorter than most other kettles I’ve tried. I tested it several times, and each time, the water reached the desired temperature consistently. The gooseneck spout isn’t there just for looks either; it allows for a slow, controlled pour that’s ideal for extracting maximum flavor from my pour-over coffees. I no longer deal with uneven brews caused by erratic pouring, which makes this device worth considering for anyone serious about their beverages.

**Drawbacks**  
- Base controls, while functional, don’t feel as premium as the rest of the kettle.  
- It doesn’t come with any preset temperature settings, which could’ve added more convenience.  
- The buzzer sound when the water is ready cannot be turned off, which some might find annoying.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this kettle to other gooseneck designs like the Fellow Stagg EKG, the Cuisinart GK-1 holds its ground in terms of aesthetics and basic functionality. The Fellow model does offer more precise temperature presets and a sleeker interface, but it comes at a much higher price point. The Cuisinart model feels like the right balance of functionality and affordability, although those who want high-end controls may gravitate toward the Fellow. Other budget-friendly kettles might match the Cuisinart in heating speed, but very few offer the combination of precision design and ergonomic build.

**Value for Money**  
The kettle lands in that sweet spot where solid features meet a reasonable price. Its excellent temperature control, quick heating process, and versatility in handling various brewing styles make it worth the investment. While it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of a premium competitor, it’s priced reasonably enough to justify the small quirks it has. Overall, for an everyday user who wants good performance without splurging, it’s an appealing option.

I live and work in a rural area, The nearest city is a 30 minute drive away.   
  
A couple of weeks ago, my mom and I had a disagreement, and she blew up at me, yelling, swearing, and telling me to pack my things and leave. A few days later, she came to me crying and apologized. I apologized too since I had said something mean.

But I’ve had enough of being here. I feel so excluded from everything, yet I’m still expected to stay home and take care of things. During meals, for example, my family sits at the coffee table while I’m expected to sit behind them with a tray. I thought it was temporary because of my knee, but they’ve made it clear I’m not welcome to sit with them even now.

I basically live in the basement. Everyone else is upstairs. Even when my knee was so bad last year that my dad had to carry me downstairs, I was still refused access to an upstairs space. I’ve asked again and again, and the answer is always no. There’s more, but this post is getting long.

After that fight, I ordered packing boxes. My mom saw them when they arrived and jokingly texted me, “Are you moving out?” I said yes. She got angry and said I’ll have to start paying rent (even though I’ve offered many times before and was always told no). Now she’s trying to convince me to stay, saying I don’t know what I’m doing, that I’ll mess up my finances, and that I should wait until I meet someone.

What makes it worse is that it kind of feels like they’re trying to sabotage me. Our house has always had messy storage areas that haven’t been touched in years. But now that I’ve got boxes and started packing, they’ve suddenly decided to start using the downstairs space, spreading their stuff around, sorting through things, and taking up room I normally work and rest in. I know it’s their house, but the timing feels really pointed.

So this week, I’m taking a personal day to secretly view an apartment in the city. I didn’t want to hide this from my family, but I felt like I had to. My mom does know I’ve been planning to move out eventually, just not that I’m this far along. And I'll have to spend that day in the city too now and am nervous about it. 

I know I’m an adult and technically I can do what I want. But with how I was raised, I feel so scared and guilty. Has anyone else been through this? How did you deal with the fear?

I’ve posted in a couple of other subreddits for advice, but I feel like people here might really understand what I’m going through.",2,1757861786.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

1ngtac1,https://i.redd.it/y47glilu85pf1.jpeg,Aeronot Perfumes: Beautifully packaged disappointment,"TL;DR: Dont get this perfume.

Aeronot perfumes comes in beautiful packaging, beautiful advertising, and so many ads on my insta that I think they probably have blackmail on Zucc himself.

However, when it came time to deliver, they horribly underperformed. Its the most synthetic, cheaply made, over saturated fragrance that I've ever bought. I wish I could just call this perfume headache inducing and get this over with, but I want to leave a complete review, just to justify paying 5 grand for this garbage.

Prelude: They have horrible customer service and the support is non existent. Please have a look at my previous post to understand that, won't be reiterating.

Tuscany Brunch: Why yes, it does smell like a brunch in Tuscany, if all you ate was simple syrup and vanilla for a week straight. There's no litchi, rose, or ginger. Maybe a hint of mint, at BEST? It's completely 1 dimensional. It's just vanilla perfume. I was so shocked to see a perfume hype itself up so much, and have absolutely no redeeming qualities. Maybe, MAYBE, if you push your nose into the skin, you can hallucinate a hint of Basil. Credit where credit is due: it has projection. My flatmate got a headache in the opposite room within a minute of me spraying this monstrosity. Otherwise, it's a synthetic cheap cologne that looks for the cheapest alternative to the descriptions it has, and lies to your face. 2/10

Surfing the Pacific Swells: I can't lie, with how we're polluting the oceans nowadays, maybe this fragrance is true to it's name! Its an aquatic fragrance, that is a garbage version of Davidoff Cool Water. It's like if someone emptied the bottle of cool water, and then filled it with regular water, and then mixed in some camphor. I cant lie, I hate this perfume for the opposite reasons for why I hate tuscany brunch. The promises of grapefruit are a LIE. They lied to me. They lied about oakmoss. They lied about rosemary. Most importantly, they lied to me about this scent being refreshing. This is just vodka with some old spice mixed inside it. It's projection is decent. It's smell is 1 dimensional. It's smells like what a white person would think a puja altar smells like. Thoroughly disappointed. 1/10


I really wanted to like Aeronot. I genuinely thought that an indigenous fragrance brand that worked so hard upon marketing, and catering to niche audiences would do well. Unfortunately, I'm deceived and lied to. Even after the horrid customer support, I had hoped that an Indian brand may ATTEMPT something unique. Unfortunately, I was met with 200 rupees perfumes being sold as 5000 rupees ones. I hope no one else suffers from this store. 

Aeronot rep, if you're seeing this (i know youre on this sub because you only reply to me when I put my complaint post up), I hope you know I'm glad you guys are doing matcha coffee and cafes. Maybe that might encourage this company to give up fragrances altogether.

1ngt9lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/basquecountry/comments/1ngt9lj/weird_servicewaiters/,Weird Service/Waiters,"I'm currently in San Sebastian with my partner. It is absolutely beautiful and practically everything we have had to eat or drink has been incredible. What we are finding though is that the waiters and general service has been pretty strange, almost hostile at times.

We went to get a coffee this morning, I stood at the counter for a few minutes without any of the staff acknowledging me whatsoever so I just ended up leaving. This afternoon we were walking around and popped into a bar to use the restroom. We wanted to be respectful for using their facilities so we intended on staying there for a drink or two also. I was sat at the bar counter for at least 5 minutes whilst my partner used the restroom, and again multiple waiters walked past and completely ignored me like I wasn't even there. We've also found in a few pintxo bars that staff either laugh at us when we try to order in our broken Spanish, or they eye roll and give us rude service when they realise we aren't local

Are we doing something wrong here or has the anti-tourism sentiment made its way to San Sebastian also? Despite the beauty and deliscious food, it's really put me off returning in the future.",1,1757861482.0,basquecountry,11,1.0,False

On the phone beforehand, she seemed pretty chill, so I figured we’d vibe in person too. But during the date at the coffee shop, things went sideways.

At first it was normal conversation, but then she suddenly went on a rant about how “men are broke, unreliable, and unmanly.” I was caught off guard and honestly uncomfortable, but I just nodded along because I didn’t want to start an argument on a first date. Then she dropped, “All girls think this but never tell you guys.”

I had already decided I will never see her again. In my head I was just like damn, no way girls actually think like this, right? It felt super toxic and not at all what I expected.

So, Reddit, is this kind of thing normal or did I just run into someone who was projecting her past experiences onto me?",229,1757861437.0,AskMenAdvice,300,0.88,False
1ngt7zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ngt7zm/is_my_partner_being_unsupportive_during_my/,Is my partner being unsupportive during my pregnancy?,"For context, we have had 2 previous losses and currently 25w pregnant. 

We both work full time, he earns a lot more than me but we both pay household bills according to our salary, I do ALL the housework, cooking etc and we have a cleaner once a week that he pays for (since he didn’t want to help me clean). He works from home 2/3 days week, I commute 45+ min each way, every day. 

For the last 2-3 weeks, I have had incredibly painful back and rib pain, I come home from work crying a lot of the time and I’m constantly uncomfortable. There was one time he offered to cook dinner when I had a breakdown after work. 

On Friday, I text him on my way home to let him know my back has been particularly bad and that traffic means it’s going to take me 1hr to get home (he knows driving is particularly uncomfortable for my back and ribs). As soon as I get in, he asks me what’s for dinner. I’m annoyed but I tell him what’s for dinner and start cooking. I finish dinner, go to tidy up and realise the dishwasher is full, so I empty and refill that. By this time, it’s 8.15pm, I tell him I’m going to bed. 

The next morning I get up to walk the dog (he is my dog, I would rather walk him as I enjoy it). On the way back, I grab 2 coffees for us (I didn’t call to ask if he wanted one), I get back and he’d just had a redbull so didn’t want a coffee - which was fine, I could have called and asked so I knew this could be the case. Anyway, I tell him I’m going to make home made sausage & egg McMuffins. I spend 30-45min making these, he eats half and throws the rest away (into the overflowing bin, may I add). He said “I’m not that hungry, I had Greggs bacon roll on my way back”. 

It annoys how unbelievably selfish he is and he doesn’t even see it. He never asks to help, he never just does things off his own back, like empty the bin that’s been overflowing. 

It’s always down to me to make us both food, whether lunch or dinner. I have to tell him to empty the bins and do anything around the house. 

Have I married a loser? 

I’m sick of him using “I pay for most things” against me. Yes, he pays for most takeaways, dinners out etc. but spending your money does not help me mentally or physically. He is paying for our wedding (30K) and also having the garden redone for the baby (25K), which I am grateful for, but he said he would pay for these things, I never ask him to pay for anything, if I do then it’s always minor. 
He also paid for me to set up a small business selling dog accessories (£350), which I have managed to pay him back half just after a couple of months. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. we have had this conversation before and it goes in circles every time about how he has a stressful job, pays for most “extra” things etc etc. I don’t know how to bring it up anymore. 

Oh, we also aren’t having sex anymore, haven’t been intimate in any sense for at least 12 weeks now.

* I do like to play a good board game. My recent favourites have been Terraforming Mars, Scythe and Wingspan. I've been on the lookout for a D&D group for years.
* Some other things I like to do are hiking, cycling, swimming and exploring.
* I'm hoping to try rock climbing or bouldering soon. I've also got driving lessons to start.

What I'm looking for in you:

* Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
* Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
* Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
* Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I live in an apartment in the city, Im on the third floor and used to hardly ever see bugs in my own apartment. This is the fourth of these guys I’ve seen. 3/4 have been around my kitchen sink. I have drain covers on both drains and regularly clean. Today, this one was crawling all over my CLEAN DISHES drying in the sink. The first one I ever saw was twice this size and IN MY KEURIG!!! 🤮
I almost died making coffee one morning. I don’t know where they’re coming from, under my sink is clean and no moisture. My counters are clean. I have noticed that the drain gnats are super bad this year. I treat almost every week now. Help me!!! I hate bugs that aren’t bees/spiders. ",1,1757861326.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

A little about me: I might start off shy, but once I warm up, I’m outgoing, fun, and love great conversation. On my days off, you’ll usually find me exploring coffee shops, thrifting, enjoying the park, or relaxing at home. I love all kinds of music  so I enjoy going to concerts and every now then I love to go out and dance! 

What I’m looking for: a partner who matches my energy. Someone who’s kind, caring, ambitious, and knows how to make me feel like a priority while also respecting space. I want someone who’s serious about a relationship — not just looking for something casual.

Why I might still be single? I’m independent and know how to take care of myself, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want someone who’s willing to step up and care for me too. I value directness so subtle hints tend to go over my head. And for anyone wondering, yes, I’m tall (5’7”) and not a small girl. I own who I am, and I’m looking for someone who’ll appreciate me for exactly that.

1ngt4jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1ngt4jx/need_math_help_finishing_tediore_throw_damage/,Need math help finishing Tediore throw damage formula,"I've been wracking my sleep-deprived brain trying to figure out how Tediore throw damage works in Borderlands 4. I've pinned down all the rules for understanding the damage of a set gun as the magazine drops, but not how to get the base damage these rules are applied to.

The rules I've figured out so far

1. You get the same maximum throw damage for the top 25% of the magazine
2. You get the same minimum throw damage for the bottom 30% of the magazine
3. You can predict what damage you will deal with X ammo remaining by applying the following formula (current ammo / (0.75 \* magazine capacity)) \* max throw damage | In this case ""max throw damage"" is the damage you deal with 75%+ of the magazine remaining.

What I am missing is the formula to figure out what the base throw damage is and I'm too sleepy for that math, I'm not even sure I'll be able to math that with sleep and some coffee if I'm being honest. I tried manipulating the numbers different ways without success.

Here is some raw data of a handful of guns to compare for those better than me at crunching numbers for patterns. I put full ammo count damage comparison for the first, for the rest I just list the gun damage and min/max throw damage. **If you look at the last 2 pistol examples, you'll see a surprisingly small difference in throw damage despite the sizeable difference in total magazine damage. I'm not sure what to make of this.**

Random findings:   
\- The non-shooting ""combo legs"" guns that jump at the enemy do only half the damage of standard throw tediores. They're really bad with the throw and forget. They do get their damage doubled if you shoot them, which brings their damage in line with the regular thrown ones.  
\-shooting a standard thrown tediore seemed to only give me a 12.5% damage boost, would make sense that it's incentivized with other combo types but not the standard throw as it's nearly impossible to pull off due to the time it takes to ready the gun after reload.",2,1757861141.0,Borderlands4,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for 1–2 reliable local folks to hang out while I fish (keep watch, be a visible presence, and help me feel safe).

Payment: I’ll gift each person a custom neck gaiter (your choice of color/pattern + your name or whatever text you want). No cash — just a friendly trade and good company.

What I’m asking:
	•	Sit/stand nearby while I fish (no heavy lifting or anything).
	•	Keep an eye out and call 911 if something dangerous happens.
	•	Be sober, reasonable, and respectful.
	•	If you can’t stay the whole time, even a 30–60 minute shift helps.

When: I usually fish [days & times — e.g., “weekday evenings around 5–8 PM”].
Where: [Exact location and meeting landmark].
How to reach me: Reply here or PM me. I’ll share my general plan and we’ll coordinate.

Being an introvert is like having a limited-data plan for social interaction.

We can go out, talk, party, mingle — but only for so long before we’re like:
“Okay, my soul needs to charge in silence now. Goodbye.” 🧘‍♂️🔌

It’s not about being boring or antisocial. It’s just that small talk feels like spam emails, and deep conversations feel like finding Wi-Fi in the mountains. Rare. Sacred. Worth everything.

We don’t hate people — we just like them in smaller batches. Like… fun-size humans. 🍫

So if you’re an introvert and people don’t always ""get"" you, that’s okay.
You weren’t built to be loud.
You were built to be real.

1ngstux,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1ngstux/what_dramas_from_the_last_few_years_will_still_be/,What dramas from the last few years will still be frequently discussed/recommended in this sub 5 years from now?,"Earlier this week, a newbie sent out a request that I, at least, interpreted to mean them asking what dramas belong in the K-drama canon. Since being canonical means standing the test of time, I focused my list on dramas that were 5 years old or older. Although I forgot Coffee Prince (thanks u/dcinmb giving this incredibly obvious oversight a shout out!), Crashing Land on You was omitted because the OP had already seen it, and Mr. Sunshine was unfairly relegated to the “Netflix-effect category,” after sitting with [the rest of the choices](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1ncg9h4/comment/nd971k1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for nearly a week, I’m still pretty happy with the list. 

But this got me thinking: Which of the ones I refused to include from 2021 onward due to being unsure how much of their popularity is still recency bias are going to enter the canon? So many viewers seem to only want to watch dramas produced in the last five years. In a few years, some newbies will probably start claiming dramas from 2021-23 are “old.” So once the cutoff of how far back some viewers are willing to go moves, which dramas are still going to break through?

Here are my top 10 choices for what dramas I see sticking around for the long haul. (Implicit in my list is an assumption that the Netflix effect will be present but reduced as other streamers figure out how to effectively market their K-content to Western audiences.)

1. **Flower of Evil** – A little bit of a cheat since this is the only 2021 drama I included on my original list, but I’m doubling down because the combination of thriller plot and high melodramatic romance, not to mention the riveting performance by Lee Joon Gi, mean this one is sticking around.
2. **Alchemy of Souls** – More than any other drama when people ask for “more like this,” people reply, “Well, there really isn’t anything.” So even if another high-budget fantasy historical drama gets made, this has its status as the first assured. 
3. **Happiness** – With its combination of zombies, slice-of-life elements, and the healthy couple dynamics that have many fans over the moon, it’s going to draw in different types of viewers. That means people are going to keep checking it out.
4. **Twinkling Watermelon** — The people who love this one LOVE it, and that seems to be about 90% of the people who watch it. There’s something about father-son dynamics coupled with the unique love story between Yi Chan and Cheong Ah that just grabs people by the heartstrings and doesn’t let go. 
5. **25 21** – There is no other coming-of-age story like this. Its polarizing ending is going to keep it in the conversation. Almost no one seems to walk away from this one unaffected. 
6. **When Life Gives You Tangerines** – Love it, hate it, think it's overrated, or have steered clear, almost no one is going to argue this is not THE drama of 2025. It has a unique storytelling structure that sets it apart. Even though it might seem too early to call, I don’t see this one going anywhere. 
7. **My Dearest** – Since this started streaming on Netflix this spring, the mentions of it have exploded. Its unique setting, historical approach, and swoon-worthy love story dig deep into people’s hearts. This is probably my bias showing, but I also think both Namkoong Min and Ahn Eun Jin are only getting bigger from here, and their fans will keep pointing this out as some of their best work. 
8. **Mouse** – Whether you think there are too many twists or you loved every one of them, this is bonkers in the way that only dramas can be. Until something even more crazy comes along, this is keeping its crown. 
9. **Beyond Evil** – The thriller equivalent of My Mister. The people who love this one love it for its depth, character development, and craft. There is a certain connoisseur-level cache this one has held onto for the last four years that will make it go the distance. 
10. **Our Movie** – I fully admit this final pick is a cheat because if I’m picking the 10 that are *most likely* to still be around, this is not one of them. However, when I was a serious Oscar watcher, I got way more joy from the single 100/1 pick that showed up on nomination morning than any of the obvious nods I got right. So I’m willing to call the long shot here just for the inordinate pleasure I’ll get in five years when I tune into a hard-fought battle after someone dares to call this one “underrated.”

I was broke, desperate, and sick of rejection emails. One night, I just snapped and wrote my CV like I was creating a fanfic character. I added skills I didn't have, projects I never worked on, and even made up a fancy-sounding consulting gig that was really just me helping my cousin with his website once.

I applied to a bunch of jobs. I got a few interviews. I learned some buzzwords, watched a ton of YouTube tutorials, and prayed no one would dig too deep. Then, one company hired me. Remote work, good salary, and full benefits. I swear I almost fainted.

The first month was hell. The imposter syndrome was crushing me; I was googling everything, and I would jump every time someone messaged me on Slack. But I kept going. And I kept learning. I faked the confidence until it wasn't fake anymore.

About six months later, now... I'm actually good at this? Like, people come to me with questions. I'm hitting my KPIs. I trained the new intern last week. My manager called me a ""core team member,"" and I nearly choked on my coffee.

I still feel weird about how I started. But at the same time, if I hadn't lied, I never would have gotten this chance in the first place. And now, I'm not lying anymore. I actually became that person. I just took a weird path to get here.

I (24 y/o female) matched with a few girls including a guy (25 y/o), but of course made my boyfriend aware of this from the start.

In fact, I invited this new guy to hang out with me, my boyfriend (27) and a group of friends altogether so that we could finally meet him. He seemed really sweet, but I noticed him immediately opening up about a very recent breakup (1,5 month ago) from a 3-year relationship.

I understood that he was likely still healing from this breakup, and to me, it made sense why he was trying to get to know more people despite the breakup still being fresh.

In fact, that first night, he hinted about being in the clinic due to the breakup/ mental health reasons. That first night, we didn’t really get into it, so he alluded to maybe grabbing a coffee together to talk more in depth about his situation.

Thus, a week or so later I invited him to a coffee in hopes of getting to know him better. To be quite honest, it was a bit awkward at first. I didn’t know how to interact with him alone since I don’t typically get to know guys apart from my boyfriend’s friends.

We maybe hung out for two or so hours, before I left to be with my boyfriend. But that evening, he spontaneously called and ask to grab drinks. So, my boyfriend, him, a friend and I went to a bar in each other’s company—it was fun.

After that, the following week, this guy and I hung out alone as he asked to do some photography with me in the city. I said yes, but we mostly talked about why he got broken up with. To be short, he cheated during a “break” between him and his ex-girlfriend. I told him that I wasn’t judging him for it and I didn’t see him any differently. But, of course, I also wasn’t making an excuses for his actions.

We spent the rest of that evening talking and getting to know each other more. He offered to buy beers for me. We drank a little. Talked some more and then went home.

But here’s where things went wrong: last night, he asked me to play pool with him at a place in his neighborhood (cue the alarm bells). I said yes, we played pool, he offered to buy me alcohol (I had no cash, otherwise I would’ve payed). We talked, played pool, THEN he invited me over to his place for a tea.

I said yes, reluctantly. He is a really sweet person, and of course, the alcohol softened my guards. I trusted him not to do anything weird, and long story, short—he didn’t. Except, when I tried to leave two hours later, I kept missing the time of my train due to us talking. I accepted that, we ended up on his bed (stupid, I know) since he wanted to show me some series he liked to watch. He got super close to me. Arms were touching. He fell asleep really close to me until I finally left at about 5 in the morning.

Before that, we spent our time talking about a range of topics: how he once got cheated on in a relationship before, the passing of his father, how he wants to be friends with his ex-girlfriend—the one that he cheated on—and he thinks she wants that, too (I’m not sure why he felt the need to tell me that, to be honest).

Obviously, I plan on telling my boyfriend everything but I know he will be (rightfully) upset with me. I would be, too. I have a problem with boundaries and people-pleasing, and I really gave this person the benefit of the doubt. I didn’t think he had romantic feelings toward me since he had just got out of a relationship, but his subtle actions proved otherwise. It’s a shame, because I enjoy his character, but I’m afraid my boyfriend and I will have to come to the decision of keeping our distance. At this point, emotionally boundaries were crossed that I feel bad for this guy and I wish last night didn’t happen so that we could keep being friends.

1ngsnmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1ngsnmn/pet_loss_my_awful_week/,Pet loss. My awful week,"On Wednesday of last week my 14yr old tabby, she began to show signs she wasn’t feeling well. She became more with drawn and didn’t eat much despite being a huge food motivated cat. She has stage 1 kidney disease.

We took her to the vets, did bloodwork and noted that her tests were all norma, in fact they improved.  Her blood pressure was great and no immediate signs of anything.

Thursday she gets an ultrasound and they say kidneys don’t appear to be in active disease, bowel looks good, pancreas has some nodules but could have been from an infection from before or just a genetic abnormality.

She’s on anti nausea, antibiotics, fluids, and appetite stimulates.

Tried everything to get her to eat and it didn’t appear to work, she got weaker. Monday she goes back to the vet and I say that I noticed she has a thousand mile stare going on, maybe it’s the meds but I bring it up. Vet checks and says she has a total cataract in the left eye, the right has a partial detached retina.

The vet is panicking because from Thursday to Monday she somehow lost 75% of her sight Immediately the vet does that pressure test finds that one eye is at 11 and the other eye is at 5.

We bring her home after she gets another round of treatment done, and are able to get her to nibble at a can of recovery food not much but some

The next day, which is Tuesday I have an appointment at five to bring her in

Just before I bring her in my male cat whom I’ve had for 13 years , really fantastic personality just the best, he throws up just some clear liquid. I think it’s a hairball so I don’t think much of it and then I take the other one to the vet.

When I go to the vet, my little tabby is now completely blind, having lost all of her eyesight in the span of two days with zero clinical reasoning

I come home and I can’t find my male cat anywhere. Turns out he’s hiding upstairs withdrawn and he throws up two more times just clear liquid so at this point, I called the vet and schedule an appointment for the morning as a precaution. Just before going to bed, he miaows one time and it sounds sort of nasally, but he’s had pretty severe upper respiratory infections in the past  year, which of all cleaned up and cleared away

Wednesday morning I go and see the cats I look in the litter box to see if the tabby’s managed to pass anything since she hasn’t eaten much of anything. To my horror, I find bloody poop all diarrhea, bloody urine, and bloody vomit. This isn’t from my tabby, but rather my little boy.

He somehow is now incredibly sick so he goes to the vet where they put him on vitamin K antibiotics anti-nausea fluids everything they can.

We bring them home and the next morning he has diarrhoea but no blood in it, and he pees with only a little bit of blood clot in it, this is an improvement

He begins to open mouth, breathe, panting, and he sounds more nasally so he goes back to the vet the same day they sent us home saying that it’s a response to some of the medication that he was given

He goes back to the vet again for a third time where another vet in the same office looks over along with my tabby and says that we’re gonna keep them on vitamin K because it’s showing improvement, but we’re also going to do a clotting test and everything else

They do all of this and tell me that his bloodwork came back completely normal with the exception of a very slight elevation in white blood cell count.

His clotting factor for rodenticide is normal however a second clotting factor has a score of 31 which they find abnormal

He comes home and sleeps in his litter box despite us trying everything to keep them from doing that .

The next morning he gets up and we hospitalize him. Tell him the vet give us everything you can IV that works is no object just do everything. They do that for a day discharge at the end and say that he’s doing better and admitted that he was a bit more perky still not doing well but more alert . The vet says that they want him back hospitalized in the morning, which we agree.

At night he sleeps in his cat carrier and in the morning we go out to the litter box and see that he’s peed dark blood, and there’s blood drops from the litter box back towards his carrier He’s very withdrawn very weak so he bring him in again and hospitalize him immediately. After another day of intensive care, the vet tells me that it’s possible he could survive the weekend if hospitalized in an emergency ICU setting, including an oxygen tank. The reason for this is that he peed blood again at the vet still not eating and his nasally sounds have become worse. They complete x-rays on him and see that he’s got all of his airways very inflamed very difficult for him to breathe, they also notice now that he’s got fluid in his chest cavity around his lungs. They do a urinalysis on him and see that he has a bladder infection and treated with aggressive antibiotics and had been doing so as a preventative measure since we brought them in.

They use the ultrasound and see that there are some changes to his pancreas which they believe is likely extremely severe pancreatitis, but they couldn’t roll out cancer

Well, all this is going on. My poor tabby is now completely blind, but eating drinking and genuinely laying out in the sun appearing to be in little to no distress and certainly no pain. The vet gave her a dose of a heavy duty steroid which she now gets a oral form of the lower dose and this seems to have stopped any further issues. The vet said that she likely has an autoimmune disease which they’ve never seen before and consider it to be a rare occurrence.

My poor little boy, after all this work after all this hope and prayers the vet tells us that the only thing left that would cause his symptomology is some type of clotting factor reducer brought on by enzymes from the pancreas

They tell us there’s nothing that they can do and I see my boy in tremendous pain in my heart breaks

He’s more than just a cat. He’s my best friend and we make the difficult decision to say goodbye and I look at him while it happens and I hold him and I tell him I love him.

I don’t know why, but I can’t shake this feeling. I made a terrible mistake.

I can’t wake up or go to bed without crying. I can’t make it through the day without breaking down. I just sit next to his stand in the sun and just sit there and hold it and just wish it was him.

I don’t know what advice I’m looking for. I just feel so sad all the time I can’t shake it.  I miss him so much and it was so sudden he was just fine and then he suddenly was gone. He was my coffee buddy. He would sit on the chair next to me and bump his head while I had my coffee he would come when I called in between night shifts he would sleep on the bed wake me up.

	•	Any offbeat or must-visit places near the above towns
	•	Good solo-travel-friendly stays if unique else i ll stick to hotels.

	•	Daily costs: Food, transport, coffee/beer without breaking the bank

	•	Couchsurfing vibe: Active community and good chance of finding hosts/events

	•	Trip length: Around 3–4 days, somewhere compact and fun to explore

I’ve heard Eastern Europe is cheaper once you’re there, while places like Southern Spain can be really affordable to fly to, but I’m not sure which balance works best.

Where would you go if you were in my shoes? Any specific cities where I’d have the most success with Couchsurfing and keeping costs down?

Thanks a lot for your tips!

**TL;DR:** London host planning a 3–4 day Couchsurfing trip in October — looking for cities that actually work well (hosts/events + low costs + cheap flights).

Sam, President of the Marine Park Young Adults Association, will be bringing a Hyperkin Retron 5, so feel free to bring your own NES, SNES, or Genesis cartridges. If board games are more your style, we’ll have favorites like Monopoly, Scrabble, Connect 4, Uno, Jenga, Sorry!, and Guess Who. Whether you want something competitive, silly, or lighthearted, there will be plenty of options to join in.

Later in the night, we’ll turn things up with karaoke! It’s a chance to grab the mic, sing your heart out, and share some laughs. Karaoke is totally optional, so you can perform or just cheer on friends.

The ""incident"" happened a few days ago, but I just have to get it off my chest.

My husband (24m) and I (24f) have been together for 9 years, 5 of which we've been married. We have two young children (3 years & 7 months). A few days ago, we were invited to coffee at my parents' house (59f & 56m), and my mother put me down in front of our children because of my ""sagging belly"" and my other ""pregnancy weight."" She said things like, ""If you don't get back in shape soon, you shouldn't be surprised if (my husband's name) leaves you for a prettier/younger woman someday,"" ""two children are no excuse to let yourself go,"" or ""I looked much better at your age. You should really work on yourself. No man would accept that, after all, it's been months since the birth of (my youngest child's name),"" etc. There was more, but that was the tone of the conversation.  My husband, of course, defended me and put her in her place, but this isn't the first time she's spoken to/about me like that. It just hurts me and makes me angry because I'm already struggling enough with my new body and my self-confidence. I should probably also mention that I've been in menopause for six months now due to an illness, and my own mother keeps shoving these comments at me. I'm actually considering breaking off contact because it's really getting too much for me. I don't want her to start talking to the kids like that one day, or what the kids might learn from it...

Thank you so much for letting me get all this off my chest. I hope everyone has a nice Sunday.

We want to say a massive thank you to the kind lady who sent us foot warmers, hats, tissues and mouthwash. 💕 Jack had them tidied away in the cupboard before I even had a chance to snap a picture!

Jack has completely taken control of organising our donation cupboard – which not only takes a massive stress off me, but also gives him real purpose. If you’ve heard me speak about Jack before, you’ll know the details, but this little job has made such a difference to us both.

This morning he came to me with his Christmas plans 🎄 – he’s going to purchase gloves, warm drinks and treats to make up goodie bags for those living on the streets of Belfast. He can’t join us in person during outreach, so this is his way of contributing and paying it forward. One day, when we can invest in transport, he hopes to join us out and about. 💛

📅 This week’s schedule
	•	Monday – Newtownards (afternoon appointments available)
	•	Tuesday – City Hospital area, Belfast (afternoon appointments available)
	•	Wednesday – Bangor (afternoon appointments available)
	•	Thursday & Friday – Meetings in Belfast

If you’re in any of these areas and would like a hair or nail appointment, please reach out. 💇‍♀️💅

We don’t currently have a Belfast outreach lined up this week. Sophie’s work schedule doesn’t allow for it and I can’t travel in alone yet as I carry so much with me. Once we have transport, I’ll be able to look for more volunteers – but for now, I wouldn’t expect anyone to help me haul heavy suitcases and boxes on and off public transport.

☕🍰 Coffee Morning & Bake Sale
I’m waiting to hear back from the council about hiring a community centre to host a coffee morning and bake sale to help raise funds for transport. I’d love to know what days/times suit you best – and what areas (Ards, Bangor, or elsewhere in Ards & North Down) would work for you.

🎁 Updates & Fundraising
	•	All ballot prizes from our last fundraiser have now been collected or posted to the winners. If you’re expecting yours in the post, it should arrive next week.
	•	I’m also on the lookout for groups, organisations or workplaces who’d like to help with fundraising. I have a list of ideas the length of me – so there’s definitely something for everyone!
	•	A kind lady also contacted me to say her church has been collecting toiletries for us for the past few weeks – how fabulous is that?! 🙏

🚐 Our Big Goal – A Van for Compassionate Cuts
We’re currently fundraising to invest in a van. By securing a van, we’ll be able to:
✨ Double our outreach opportunities in Belfast (cutting travel time in half)
✨ Carry more toiletries, clothing and warm items for those on the streets
✨ Recruit more volunteers and bring them along to outreach
✨ Free up more time for paid appointments, which means more free haircuts & toiletries for those most in need
✨ Travel further afield and support even more people

If you’d like to get involved and help us reach this huge goal, you can support us here:

1ngsjn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1ngsjn3/evaluate_resinate_glass_cleaner_is_it_really/,Evaluate Resinate Glass Cleaner Is It Really Worth the Hype?,"Testing the Resinate RGCS001 daily has been quite an interesting ride. I came across this cleaning solution because I’ve been dealing with stubborn stains on glass and ceramic surfaces for ages. It’s one of those products you wish you’d known about sooner, especially if you’re someone who hates scrubbing endlessly only to still miss a spot. The Resinate RGCS001 feels like the Swiss Army knife of cleaners—it claims to work on glass, Pyrex, metal, and ceramic, so naturally, the ambitious promises had me intrigued. For something both earth-friendly and effective, I had to give it a shot.

**Ease of Use and Performance**  
I started out with some grimy glass jars that had been sitting in my kitchen, daring anyone to clean them. With the Resinate cleaner, it was refreshingly easy. You just pour a small amount directly on the surface and lightly scrub. The abrasive formula got to work almost instantly. What impressed me most was how little effort it took—there’s some kind of magic in those tiny granules. I even tested it on those stubborn metal coffee filters that accumulate oils. Boy, it worked like a dream. For glass, metal, or ceramics, I could see this replacing half my kitchen cleaners.

**Product Advantages**  
- Works effectively on various surfaces like glass, Pyrex, ceramic, and metal.  
- The earth-friendly and biodegradable formula makes it safe and sustainable.  
- No VOCs or alcohol, so you’re not inhaling harsh chemicals while cleaning.  
- The small granules break down resin and other build-ups quickly and effortlessly.

[Check Resinate RGCS001 price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b00lf0z3hy/)

**Versatility in Applications**  
I put this cleaner to the test on more than just kitchen items. My ceramic bathroom tiles? Clean. The inside of a cloudy Pyrex dish left over from baking lasagna? Spot-free in seconds. Even an old metal sink drain cover that I could never fully de-gunk before now looks like the day we installed it. Not many products work well across such a range, but this one held its ground. It’s also convenient to use once, rinse, and not worry about leaving residue behind, which I really appreciated.

**Key Benefits**  
- Multi-surface cleaning eliminates the need for multiple specialized products.  
- Efficient action cuts cleaning time in half.  
- Leaves no residue, providing streak-free results.

**Downsides to Consider**  
It’s not a perfect product, and there are a couple of areas where I feel it could improve. The 12-ounce bottle might not be enough for households with frequent, heavy cleaning needs. Also, the formula can feel a little thick, which isn’t ideal for people who may prefer spray-on cleaners. The design of the bottle could use some improvement too—it’s functional but doesn’t necessarily stand out in presentation.

**Shortcomings**  
- The size may not last long for large households.  
- Formula may feel overly dense for some tasks.  
- Bottle design could look more appealing.

**Competing Products**  
The competition for multi-surface cleaners is fierce. Compared to Method’s Glass + Surface Cleaner, the Resinate RGCS001 feels a bit more heavy-duty. The granules in this product set it apart from liquid-only solutions, especially when you need an abrasive touch. However, for polished surfaces that simply need streak-free wiping, products like Windex might come out ahead. That said, this cleaner’s distinct eco-friendly and VOC-free formula is a major plus over competitors, making it safer for families and those concerned about chemical exposure. In terms of price-performance balance, Resinate still holds up better against some high-end natural brands, which are pricier and don’t always clean as effectively.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Speaking of value, I’d say this product sits in a good middle ground. It’s affordable enough for regular use but not too cheap that you have to wonder if it’s cutting corners. While the bottle size could be larger, the powerful formula means you’re using less per clean—kind of a classic case of quality over quantity. If you want one product to clean the majority of your household items and surfaces, it reduces the need for buying multiple specialized ones.

I realize it is probably artificial and not even actual nut flavoring, but I am highly sensitive and don't want to risk it. So every time I visit, even if it's for a week or longer, I use my own press to make coffee. I don't trust using the Keurig for cross-contamination. I don't even want to bring it up because, to me, it seems obvious that if your son is allergic to nuts maybe back off the nut flavored coffee while he's there. It makes me feel like an afterthought, or like his morning Folgers takes priority over my health. 

At the same time, it's his house. But he's drank it throughout my youth and adulthood. I can remember having physical reactions to just being around it when I was younger.

1ngsit6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1ngsit6/explore_best_electric_coffee_percolator_cuisinart/,Explore Best Electric Coffee Percolator Cuisinart Worth the Hype,"Using the Cuisinart PRC-12N percolator every morning has been both a nostalgic experience and a practical coffee brewing solution. It brings a classic touch to my kitchen while boasting modern enhancements that make the ritual of coffee-making a lot more enjoyable. Featuring stainless steel construction and a sleek design, it truly knows how to stand out on the countertop. Though I didn't initially expect much from manual operation coffee makers, this one managed to surprise me with its intuitive functionality and well-thought-out features.

**Ease of Use and Design Aesthetics**  
This percolator’s stainless steel body not only delivers a polished, premium look but ensures durability over time. I absolutely love the visual transparency the knob on top provides—it’s oddly satisfying watching the bubbling progress of the brew through it. The clarity adds excitement, particularly when you're waiting for your first caffeine hit of the day. Alongside that, the comfortable handle and knuckle guard make pouring seamless, even for my slightly clumsy morning self. A no-drip spout? Yes, please—it's genuinely effective and eliminates annoying spills that other coffee makers tend to cause.

**Upsides**  
- Durable, stainless steel body maintains style and functionality  
- Transparent knob for a visually engaging brewing process  
- Comfortable, ergonomic handle with a knuckle guard for safe handling  

[Check Cuisinart PRC-12N price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0b6ln174x/)  

**Performance and Brewing Capabilities**  
On mornings when I have my relatives over, the Cuisinart PRC-12N really shines with its adaptable capacity of brewing anywhere from 4 to 12 cups of coffee. It handles everything from small pots for my solitary mornings, to full batches when my family wants to linger for an afternoon cup. The stainless steel basket comes with markings inside, helping me gauge exactly how much ground coffee is needed. It saves me from guessing every time and makes the brewing experience entirely foolproof.

Despite being manual, the process is fairly easy to master after using it a handful of times. The percolation itself produces strong, flavorful coffee that rivals what I’d expect from a café. If robust, aromatic coffee is what you crave, this percolator rarely disappoints. Though modern alternatives like automatic coffee machines may win in convenience, they don’t quite match this hands-on brewing charm.

**Boons in Functionality**  
- Precision no-drip spout ensures no mess when pouring  
- Varied capacity gives flexibility for single cups or entertaining guests  
- Reusable filter removes the need for disposable paper filters  

**Areas of Concern**  
There are aspects somewhat worth nitpicking, though. For instance, being manually operated, it takes slightly more time and effort than automatic machines. Early mornings when I'm rushing for work, it’s hard not to wish it could brew a bit faster. Additionally, while the no-drip spout is genius, the stainless steel lid can retain heat, which requires handling with care. Lastly, its heavier build might not be the easiest to move around frequently if kitchen space is limited.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Brew speed slower compared to automatic coffee makers  
- Lid may get quite warm, requiring caution while handling  
- Bulkier than some compact, automatic alternatives  

**Product Rivals**  
Stacking the PRC-12N against other electric coffee percolators, like the Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Percolator, was an interesting comparison. The Hamilton Beach sometimes edges ahead when it comes to brew speed, but the Cuisinart PRC-12N steals the crown for better design and durability. Compared to drip brewers with similar capacities, like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker, the percolator delivers a stronger, unmistakably vintage coffee flavor that smooth machines can't quite replicate.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its stainless steel build, thoughtful design elements, and capacity versatility, this coffee maker justifies its price point reasonably well. While it’s not the cheapest percolator out there, it offers quality that outlasts its competitors, making it a smart investment for those seeking both form and function. Morning coffee feels less like a chore and more like a soothing ritual thanks to its elegant design and reliable performance.

# Tutorial: How to Make a CEMS-1000 Screen

Hey there! I'm Coffee Crisp from the EAS community, and I've been thinking of making some tutorials for certain screens. I'll do the CEMS-1000 for my first tutorial! It's a simple and kind of underused screen in mocks, and it looks amazing if you get it right! With this tutorial and a bit of tinkering, I can guarantee you'll be satisfied if you just follow these steps!

This guide does **NOT** involve:

* *Creating SAME headers.*
* *Creating a TTS voice.*
* *Creating a mock with said screen.*

This guide is **SOLELY** for you to create this screen, although VHS effects are included in **Step 4**!

**DISCLAIMER:** This tutorial can be followed on mobile until **Step 4**.

**Step 1: Find the font**

The CEMS-1000 has a specific font that differentiates from other screens, such as the **EASyPLUS** or the **VDS 840**. I've seen a lot of newbies use **VCR OSD Mono** or **VCR EAS** for the CEMS-1000, and there is definitely a noticeable difference between the two fonts!

The correct font is made by a talented fellow known as **PajamaFrix**. His font portfolio can be found at this site: [https://ftp.park-city.club/frix/fonts/](https://ftp.park-city.club/frix/fonts/).

PajamaFrix makes some great fonts! You'll want to download [uPD6465.ttf](https://ftp.park-city.club/frix/fonts/uPD6465.ttf), as it is an accurate recreation of a font used in many laserdisc players and, more notably, the CEMS-1000!

[The font you should have downloaded!](https://preview.redd.it/bzpv1o8dj1pf1.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d26d28e7b0f6f69fbc4209163db9b05c9444b8b)

**Step 2: Uploading the font to your library**

To upload the font to your CapCut library, click on ""My fonts"" in mobile. For PC, simply click on the .ttf file you have downloaded and click ""Install"" on it! Then, make a new project, add some text, and click on ""Font.""

You'll see a search bar at the top! Click on it and search for 'uPD6465.' *(Note: Ensure you restart CapCut when you install the font if it's open!)*

For me, a glitch occurred where uPD6465 appeared as *""My Font Medium.""* If you also have this glitch and uPD6465 does not appear when you search for it, search for 'My Font Medium' instead!

**Step 3: Making the screen**

Create a new project (If possible, do it in 4:3, although I did it in 16:9).

[The background you'll use!](https://preview.redd.it/hqjh054tm1pf1.png?width=469&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8bebf0544c391312029ce9a4ed0f8266861ed6)

Now, you'll want to download this blue background and upload it to ""Media"" before adding it to your project. Plaster it fully over your background. Your end result should be something like this:

Before **anything else**, click on 'Ratio' and crop your screen into a 4:3.

https://preview.redd.it/wvud9z83l4pf1.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4053e6bfcf2672870da067b83724f8ceb4c6e54

Now, you'll want to look at a real example of the CEMS-1000 screen, like the one I posted above, and you'll want to copy from it. First of all, type **""EAS Transmission""** in your default text.

Meeting someone is to get to know them—coffee or a walk works fine.

Expecting a fancy dinner from someone you barely know isn’t proving your value—it can make you come across as gold-digging. Manners and thoughtfulness can be seen over a simple meet-up.

I’m a woman, already taken, just sharing my thoughts. I know some might bully me for this, but it feels like the first date obsession is getting out of hand.",14,1757859277.0,UAE,16,0.86,False

One of the biggest strains on our relationship for me is the constant reminders to clean up after himself, little things adding up. This morning I woke up to find out her turned on the air conditioner when he got home at 4am from hanging with his friends with the window next to it WIDE open, after we got 2 months of electricity bills at $200+ each month. I then found his blue spit and excess toothpaste lining the bathroom sink from when be brushed before bed, after the bathroom was cleaned yesterday. 

Before I send this list of basic cleaning rules & make him sign it, can someone please tell me AIO? ",3,1757859238.0,AmIOverreacting,16,1.0,False

My husband (24m) and I (24f) have been together for 9 years, 5 of which we've been married. We have two young children (3 years & 7 months). A few days ago, we were invited to coffee at my parents' house (59f & 56m), and my mother put me down in front of our children because of my ""sagging belly"" and my other ""pregnancy weight."" She said things like, ""If you don't get back in shape soon, you shouldn't be surprised if (my husband's name) leaves you for a prettier/younger woman someday,"" ""two children are no excuse to let yourself go,"" or ""I looked much better at your age. You should really work on yourself. No man would accept that, after all, it's been months since the birth of (my youngest child's name),"" etc. There was more, but that was the tone of the conversation.  My husband, of course, defended me and put her in her place, but this isn't the first time she's spoken to/about me like that. It just hurts me and makes me angry because I'm already struggling enough with my new body and my self-confidence. I should probably also mention that I've been in menopause for six months now due to an illness, and my own mother keeps shoving these comments at me. I'm actually considering breaking off contact because it's really getting too much for me. I don't want her to start talking to the kids like that one day, or what the kids might learn from it...

Thank you so much for letting me get all this off my chest. I hope everyone has a nice Sunday.

1ngscj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1ngscj3/should_an_academic_be_always_defensive_for_success/,Should an academic be always defensive for success?,"I am in my laste PhD year, and realized people sometimes make unfair/nagative comments about me and my work.

I think in a diverse academic environment being faced with disagreements is inevitable therefore my initial/default response is not reacting and just hearing. I think i can either use my energy in observing/doing my own stuff or getting into those—sometimes passive aggressive—discussions and reactions.

Also I of course like criticism when it is phrased clearly. But my experience have been mostly defending myself somehow and seeing no improvements in my relationships with those colleagues.

I sometimes felt this silence might have been understood as agreement to such views. 

Is that so? how should an academic react to those situations? I mean in unofficial settings, like coffee chats etc. not in—for example—annual assessments.
