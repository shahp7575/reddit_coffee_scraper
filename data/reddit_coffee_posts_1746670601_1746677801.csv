I was in this cozy little coffee shop working on some stuff, enjoying my usual latte, when I spotted this cute guy a couple tables away. He had this nerdy kinda charm going on with glasses and a book in hand. We’d exchanged glances a couple times, and I figured why not initiate a little harmless flirtation?

Anyway, I mustered up the courage and wrote a quick note on a napkin, scribbling: 'Hey, bookworm! Can I guess your name? I bet I’ll get it in 3 tries!' Then I walked over to his table, placed it down, and hurried back to my seat before my coffee got jealous.😁

After a couple of attempts (I banked on guessing basics like Alex or James, obviously), he smiled and gestured me over. Turns out, I didn't guess his name, but he challenged me back to write down what book I thought he was reading. 

Neither of us guessed right on anything, but we spent the next hour making up silly guesses that got increasingly weird, and now I know way more about 15th-century Mongolian architecture than I ever intended. 

We decided to call it even, and I’m pretty sure his book is still a mystery. A fun little coffee shop game... who knew that could be so entertaining?",1,1746677321.0,GentleFlirtations,0,1.0,False

Boy do I have a doozy!

Last week I had a delivery of 100 little ducks. You know the kind people leave around their friends houses when they are on holiday. My work is going through a tumultuous time and I thought it might boost morale or at least give a reprieve from the negativity for 5 mins.

So I dotted these ducks around for people to find and it went down a treat! With people even rehiding the ducks for other coworkers the next day. People were laughing and talking about it for a couple of days. Even the directors found a couple, they were a bit bemused but left us to it.

One of the directors made a comment that without his glasses he assumed they were sweets that had been left out. He was glad he took a closer look before trying some!

My problem colleague overheard this and then made the comment that I was grooming both children and men with the ducks.

Office fun = me being a child groomer.

Reported to HR but I think I'm ready to move on to a different company now.

*\[later that afternoon\]*

UPDATE: Had a meeting with my manager this afternoon and will be raising a formal grievance against the problem coworker.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I'm desperately trying to figure what dots they thought they were connecting to make that conclusion. There's gotta be more than they're convinced is related to this. Ducks equal grooming? The confusion is strong

>**OOP:** After everyone went silent following her comment. She was trying to explain that it was like I was luring children with sweets but with ducks... Even though our office is 18+.  
Not entirely sure how she jumped to that but as said she's the problem colleague. She's not happy unless she's insulted someone.  
*OOP adds:*  
Later that afternoon after I had brought it up to my manager, she tried saying it was the kind of joke she would make with her husband on the sofa... Had to say that I'm not her husband, I'm not even her friend, I am her work colleague in a professional setting... How often do they joke about that sort of stuff for it to feel so normal for her?!

Commenter: Put an obscenely large number of ducks on just that person's desk.

>**OOP:** I didn't hide all 100! Still have a few left. Might have to do that next time in the office

Commenter: Sounds like the problem co-worker is trying to start a situation to get rid of you. Be careful.

>**OOP:** Thanks I've reported her for other things in the past. For comments like ""your so fat you should be dead"" etc. so I have a trail with HR already.

Commenter: That bitch! Omg. You’re calmer than I am. I’m pretty sure I would say something awful as a knee jerk response, before I could remind myself that I’m at work.

>**OOP:** They are usually in the middle of other conversations so I'm usually left reeling a bit and then she gets up and flounces away 9/10 straight after

*To another commenter asking how she hasn't been fired:*

>I think the problem is no one reports it. She makes nasty comments to everyone but I think every one feels the same that it's just one comment what will reporting it even do. She's also not silly. She has only slipped up and insulted me in front of others a handful of times. Two years worth of insults mostly when we were alone together.  
Our reception team pulled me aside to ask some questions a few weeks ago. I answered them and asked why they didn't ask the problem coworker as it's actually her area not mine. They felt she would give them grief for not knowing. I told my manager what they had said to me and she went down to talk to them about it but they didn't mention problem coworker and instead say they grabbed me because they saw me.  
Amazing one person can create such a fear culture about themselves

Commenter: Do not leave over this idiot. Your workplace needs you and your ducky joy over them. I think you should pursue some sort of defamation case against them. They have no right to put this on your name with no proof to it.

>**OOP:** Thanks I appreciate that! I try and make work a bit more fun, if I've gotta spend 8 hours with these people I'm gunna want them to be happy haha.  
I have a meeting with HR tomorrow so will see where they are willing to go with this first.

Ok, since it’s been definitively decided that your coworker is mean and crazy, can we talk about the ducks please? I’ve never heard of this before and am intrigued. Also, what do jeeps have to do with it?

>**OOP:** Jeep owner leaves little rubber ducks on other jeep owners cars, there's an FB group on it! It's a cute little community thing  
The hiding ducks was a trend on tiktok a couple of years ago , the ducks are tiny under a centimeter big. You are meant to hide them both in plain sight and in silly places. One duck made it's way into one directors office and his empty coffee mug.

*\[editor's note- can confirm, I've had a few contracts with an opera company where someone hid a bunch of tiny ducks in random places. It definitely brought a smile to my face to find them!\]*

Commenter: Are you a gay man? Trying to figure out if they’re applying some kind of homophobic interpretation to your actions. You know…. With you trying to groom all the men and children…..

>**OOP:** Lol no I'm a straight female. However she is transphobic and homophobic. She doesn't make outward comments but one of my brothers is gay and the other is trans. Whenever I mentioned them she is unhappy

Commenter: Every accusation is a confession, they say \[...\]

>**OOP:** Yes it does feel that way. Most times she's insulted me it's because she's insecure of something and will take it out on me.  
E.g. her Dr told her to lose weight. That was the day she told me I was so fat I should be dead.  
She was told she has high cholesterol so she took my tea out of my hands and wouldn't allow me to put sugar in because I was killing myself.  
She was reprimanded at work for wearing flip flops and vest tops to the office. so she insulted my clothes.  
The list goes on and on  
Not sure how child grooming fits into it though.

**Mini update in Comments: February 7, 2025**

I spoke to the director yesterday and he was a sweetheart and made me feel a lot better about the whole situation. I think i am going to continue with a grievance and at least then in the future her nastiness will be taken as evidence.

He did say while vile he doesn't think its a sackable offence yet but did also say the only thing he was aware of at the time of the conversation was that she had called me a child groomer. None of the history. So it will still be investigated full if i raise the grievance.

Brought up conflicting feelings as i don't want it to escalate/ her to lose her job, i just don't want to be insulted in the workplace.

*Comments:*

Commenter: Well, at least you’ve got lots of witnesses. If she’s truly disliked in your workplace as the ‘problem colleague’ then they’ll back you up

>**OOP:** Yes I spoke to one of the ladies today, the grievance form makes you state the witnesses and I wanted to make sure they were comfortable with me putting them down and she was lovely and said she'd support in any way she could.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1iyn848/update_coworker_claims_that_i_groom_children/)**: February 26, 2025 (3 weeks later)**

So it has been three weeks since my co-worker called me a child groomer and my manager called us into a meeting where I called out her poor behaviour over the past two years. Since then I have not heard or spoken to my co-worker. She ignores any work related message and is refusing to come into the office. She is working from home although I can't see that much work is being done.

She has recently asked a department that I have been working closely with if she can join them in their office if she has to come into work.

HR have asked us if we would both be willing to attend mediation. I said yes. I am not sure what my co-workers response was but since it was due to start this week and has not, i assume she refused to it.

I was going to raise a grievance over this but I was invited to a job interview at a company I had previously applied for and was offered the job. Contract signed and notice handed in!

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Oooooo!!!! If they ask are you going to mention that how they botched this incident inspired you to see what else was available?

Congratulations!

>**OOP:** Oh of course, my work do exit interviews so it will all be being brought up!

*OOP adds a bit more context to the story:*

>I hid little ducks around the office. She joined in. Had a great time. Two days later called me a child groomer. I got upset as I was groomed as a child. Which anyone could work out considering how old I was when I had my first child. (She has my DOB on our central system and our children are the same age).  
I went to my manager upset. She called us into a meeting together. Co-worker walked in and immediately mocked me for being upset because she was only joking. I got even more upset and called her out on her behaviour (There isnt a week this woman doesn't insult or belittle me in some way).  
When asked WTF she thought was similar to child grooming she said it was like I luring children with sweets but with the ducks in a 18+ office.  
*OOP follows up with another comment:*  
Just to add, while I am the most frequently insulted/belittled by her, she does do it to the other staff too. A colleague in another department has just told me she reached out to problem colleague asking for help with a task yesterday and got a very passive aggressive response back, her question was answered but she was made to feel stupid. She did read the email responses out loud to her bank of desks, the head of HR was sitting opposite her at the time.  
Lots of tuts but nothing else.

Commenter: I’m sure you know this, but your co-worker should have been fired on the spot. You can let them know in your exit interview that if this same co-worker continues to spread accusations about you in this workplace, they’ll be liable for allowing it to go on.

>**OOP:** She should have. The fact she didn't and multiple people also heard and reported it and still she didn't and still hasn't faced any repercussion and is instead breaking our hybrid working agreement etc.  
It was time to leave. The new job is a step up with better pay and better hours so at least I have that going for me.

Commenter: I'm constantly amazed at companies like this. I'm over here wondering will I be laid off if I don't adhere to the ever changing rules...and there are companies that bend over backwards to accommodate a poorly performing person who then just refuses to come in.

>**OOP:** There seems to be one rule for the problem people and one rule for the rest of us. I don't think I would get away with insulting people like that, especially to superiors!

*On a happier note regarding ducks:*

>Its such a small but fun thing to do! I know it wouldn't work in most offices but for the people I had planned it for it went down a treat!  
It is a work friends big birthday in a couple of weeks. She missed out on the ducks and was disappointed about it so we are planning a little scavanger hunt through our local high street for her (Shes a well known resident) and ending it at her fave restaurant. I'm planning on little envelopes with clues and a little duck in each envelope too

**\*\*\*\*\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1kcgl8f/final_update_coworker_claims_i_groom_children/)**: May 1, 2025 (over 2 months later)\*\*\*\***

It's been 3 months since my coworker accused me of grooming children because I made up an office scavenger hunt. I'm afraid this isn't a very exciting update and not much has happened between me and Problem Coworker.

A few comments have asked for ages. She is mid 50s and I am 30. We are both married.

Just over a month ago, me and problem coworker spoke over teams. I apologised for losing my temper following the child grooming comment and she apologised for how I ""took"" the child grooming comment. Problem coworker then stated that she will not communicate with me again as she doesn't know how I will react to her comments. And is now worried for my mental health. She has previously mocked my self harm scars and called me an attention seeker.

We have had no further contact.

HR set up a mediation meeting with a union. We had to have individual one on one meetings and then an all day meeting with us together with the mediator.

My individual meeting was non eventful. I outlined everything that had happened and said that I felt mediation was just the companies tick box exercise to prevent me claiming constructive dismissal and show they had taken a reasonable step to prevent conflict. The mediator said he could not respond. He did pressure me that I needed to hear out her side and she was very apologetic and upset about it all. I then had to explain a situation with a temp hire where PC (Problem coworker) shouted and insulted the temp, they then had an argument and PC cried saying they didn't want to hurt people. The next time they saw each other (a year later) PC insulted her weight. I also brought up that the silent treatment now is another form for bullying as I am being left out of key meetings and decisions and it is affecting my work.

We did not attend the mediation full day meeting. Unfortunately my dad passed away unexpectedly the weekend before. I had already arranged a DRs app because I had developed a facial twitch and I Don't want go into tmi but other unpleasant side effects. The DR originally signed me off for 2 weeks but when I mentioned my dad had died that weekend it was extended to a month. With the proviso that I have an additional meeting before the fit note ended in case I couldn't face returning to the company.

I won't lie that was the worst month of my life and coming back to this mess was absolutely awful. I'm so grateful that the Dr's took me seriously as my mum didn't cope and we (my siblings) alternated staying with her until she was stable, which I wouldn't have been able to do without the month off. My parents live a 10 hour round trip away for me and further for my siblings.

I originally had 2 weeks left of my notice period when I returned. On my first day back my manager pulled me into a meeting to say that she and HR were worried about my mental health and wanted me to have a phased return to work so asked me to WFH the rest of the week. My final day was also moved up due to outstanding annual leave.

I was in the office less than 2 hours on my first day back before the first person approached me for help because they had been trying to work with PC but she had been rude and dismissive.

PC has applied for numerous internal jobs and been rejected for them all, one of which was with the first person to approach me for help!

PC has continued to refuse all communication with me. I could see that she had a meeting with one of the directors but aside from that I'm not sure what else happened following the child groomer comments.

I was very spoilt by office friends and they made a fuss with a lovely lunch out on my final day and some thoughtful gifts.

After lunch I had my exit interview, where i was asked why I left, would I consider coming back, how do I rate the company. It was not a fun meeting and I was very critical of HR and the company. I did state that had PC been handled properly from the start I wouldn't have considered leaving the company.

I'm a week free of that company and my facial twitch has already stopped!

There might be further sightings of PC as I work part time for a sister company, they have not managed to find a replacement for me so I will continue in the role until a replacement is found but there will not be a need for us to communicate.

***OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: I'm so sorry for your loss of your Father.

PC seems also to have mental health issues. I'm not excusing their behavior. There is no excuse for bullying. OP, I know you've gone over this a million times in your head and with others. Do you see how she dropped a bomb, (in front of others, was it?) then pitifully offers, ""I'm sorry you took that for a bomb.""

But if others heard it - the word was OUT.

She's the nut and I am so glad you've extricated from the place!

Take good care.

>**OOP:** Yes I do think she has something mental health issues. She at the least is bitterly unhappy with how her life has turned out.  
Yes that is what happened. A lot of incidents I've mentioned in previous posts have been one on one but the later ones were said and done in front of colleagues. I had 2 colleagues reach out and also provide a statement to HR following the grooming comments.

Commenter: May PC step on all the legos.

And hopefully you’ll never have to see her again. I hope the new job is excellent too

>**OOP:** Bless you thank you, I'm really excited to have this chapter of my life behind me!

**My partner cutting off a lifelong family friend because of her inappropriate messages**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!accusations of controlling behavior, mentions of infidelity, cancer, emotional manipulation, emotional distress!<

---- 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Om5xN3kJf3): **April 24, 2025**

So I am in a kind of fucked up situation, I mean I know I am right to have my boundaries but I also feel guilty that my husband is cutting off help to lifelong family friends because of me.

My husband is a doctor so it’s normal that family and friends kind of come to us/him for reassurance because someone you know either reaffirming what you were told or giving you a referral if possible makes people feel better. Zero issues there, I love that he is empathetic and it honestly makes me wicked proud of him that people think that highly of him.

So he has a friend who he grew up with, their families pretty much raised them together. They were always friends since we met but never like super close plus we live in a different part of the US. I have met her multiple times and she seemed very sweet. She also was married when I originally met her and has two kids. Well her father is very sick with a type of cancer that has a low rate of recovery. We live in the northeast and they live down south so our medical care is definitely exponentially better. My husband has been helping consult and just being a good friend to them to make sure he gets the best care possible. This friend has been a bit needy and using him for emotional support. I get it, I’m not jealous because what we have is solid. (Plus when he has his medical mindset that’s it)

Well over the weekend he woke up to some very questionable texts from this friend. She pretty much declared her love for him, claimed god brought them together through this and that she always knew they’d end up together. Like what the actual fuck? He told me as soon as he saw them in the morning. He messaged her back saying that what she said was highly inappropriate, she needs to find a therapist and that he no longer can help out. She claims she was drinking and emotional. She also begged him not to tell me. We don’t keep secrets. He blocked her number. I don’t know what she told his mom exactly but she’s so angry and apparently it’s all my fault. We don’t like each other either, I’m not the Christian housewife she envisioned we for her son I guess.

I didn’t ask him to cut all ties, he did it out of respect and says that she has doctors and family to lean on. I feel slightly guilty because I hope that this doesn’t impact quality of care. Maybe there was a way to cut her out and my husband helps her mom with medical stuff when needed. This whole situation has been making me feel gross. AITAH? I don’t think I am but I feel bad.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA - but I bet your MIL has been feeding this woman all kinds of bullshit about you and feeding her ego.

> **OOP:** I 100% believe that she is flaming this fire.

**Commenter 2:** It's so refreshing to see here an adult prioritizing their spouse against their dumb original family!

OP, you are in a complex situation, but no way an AH, and your husband just did the right (and professional) thing!

> **OOP:** I am all about helping and advocating for those I care about. I just don’t want to feel the guilt that her dad could have had some of that because his daughter is an idiot who decided to shoot her shot with my husband during an emotional time.

**Commenter 3:** Absolutely NTA. Good on your husband for cutting that off. Your MIL is a dumb ass who probably wanted them to end up together. Don't let her gaslight you into thinking you did something wrong. You didn't even cut her off, your husband did

> **OOP:** Oh I absolutely agree she wanted them to get together. In her mind them ending up together would mean him moving back there, her having grandkids and their families being even more intertwined.

**Commenter 4:** lol. Now get to work on cutting out the mum. NTA.

> **OOP:** She was cut out for a while haha she begged him not to marry me… She also said our marriage wasn’t real because we didn’t have a church wedding.. 🥴

**Commenter 5:** NTA. Aside from the question of whether your husband did right to cut her off (and I believe he was absolutely right), this is his issue and not yours, and he made the decision. You have no cause to feel guilty about it.

As for his mother blaming you - that is sooo typical! I also have a MIL who hated me (now she is to feeble to do any harm) and whenever her son did something she didn't approve of, it was always my fault. That is controlling mothers' way of pretending that their son is still under their control, and it's only the outsider who is pulling him away. Just ignore her.

> **OOP:** He’s an only child, so I think that plays into her being even more insanely possessive over him. He just doesn’t tolerate it. He said graduating high school was like being set free from a jail, because she was so controlling up until he left the house. She even tried to dictate where he went to undergrad because she wanted him to stay somewhat close.

**OOP and her husband on going LC/NC with MIL**

> **OOP:** We went no contact for a while and are currently low contact because she makes it impossible to have a relationship with my FIL without her. She had been on good behavior for the last year or so… I let him communicate with them for us because she is too much of a headache for me. He knows how to handle her because he has been doing it his whole life.

**OOP on MIL wanting grandchildren**

> **OOP:** My mom also really wanted grandchildren, but my mom was with me when I went through cancer in my early 20’s and learned I was going to have to get a hysterectomy. 😔 My MIL knows why I cannot have kids and she seemingly resents me for it. My husband knew right when we started dating that I couldn’t have children and about what I went through medically.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/4DuCdxWi6S): **May 1, 2025 (one week later)**

I wanted to just post a quick update on our situation. My husband called his mother to try to set clear boundaries (I am pretty sure she doesn’t believe that boundaries apply to her) and set things straight before they escalated more… Well apparently that crazy train had already left the station. He called her on speaker phone, which he told her, while I was in the room. She lost her mind and demanded they have a private conversation because this was a matter between “family”. He corrected her, and let her know I am family. She then went on a rant about how I was displaying “abusive” and “controlling” behavior. She claimed I was isolating him from his family, like I did before. (We went no contact with her once before because of her bad behavior and she blames me and I guess had been holding on to that) Like what the fuck?! I had to leave the room then because my anxiety was too much. He is the most calm and levelheaded person I know and he was starting to rise his voice. 

About five minutes later he came into our bedroom where I was trying to not have an anxiety attack. He told me he let her know how disgusted he was with her behavior and disappointed that she didn’t learn her lesson about trying to interfere with our marriage. He also informed her for an indefinite amount of time he will be taking space from her. He also told her not to try to contact me, I have her silenced already. Oh one fun little fact that came out is that his mom and ex have been seeing a lot of each other. His mom has been helping with the kids while the ex friend* and her mom are dealing with medical stuff for her dad.

Just to address a couple things… YES! I realize I have an amazing partner, I love this man so much. I regularly tell him and show him how much I love and appreciate him so don’t worry!

The reason I thought I might be somewhat in the wrong is because I have battled cancer in my early 20’s. During that time I had a boyfriend cheat on me with a good friend of mine because he was “overwhelmed” and they tried to gaslight me into thinking it was my fault because of all of the stress. I felt so abandoned and hurt I just didn’t want to feel like I was making anyone else feel that bad. I know the situation is very different. I am a bit of a people pleaser, working on that with my therapist. Cancer is the worst and my heart hurts for anyone who is going through it that includes family of the person who is sick.

I also want to say to the person who called me a narcissist because this isn’t about me… I think it says more about you than me that what you took from my post was just that. I hope you have the day you deserve.

Thanks to everyone else for the support and advice, I genuinely appreciate it.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I read your old post to get familiar and I’m laughing at your MIL’s reaction. She’s upset you’re not the ideal Christian wife…well that friend going after a married man is totally the Christian thing to do 😂

Your husband is a good man. I wish I read more posts where the husband had as much of a backbone as what yours does.

You didn’t do anything wrong.

> **OOP:** She is literally the worst. She’s so judgmental and controlling. One of her favorite things is to make comments and count how many drinks other people are having… One day I swear I would end up snapping and letting her know that her coffee cup she always has with her does NOT contain coffee.

**Commenter 2:** NTA... man gotta stand up to his mama sometimes. Wife looks like she's taking it in stride anyway. What do you think the MIL's next move is gonna be, more passive-aggressive ""concern"" or full-blown attack mode?

> **OOP:** She tried to call my husband using his dad’s phone! Fortunately we were busy so he didn’t answer it. My husband called his dad back like an hour after and he was like “I’m sorry your mom must have used my phone…” My husband had to fill him in and let him know what actually happened vs her bullshit sob story she was spinning. He’s a good guy, and he understands that we need to step away from his wife.

**Commenter 3:** Some friendships have expiration dates, especially when they turn toxic. Your partner chose you over chaos that speaks volumes.

> **OOP:** I’m thankful that he made that choice on his own, he’s a very good man.

**Did MIL had her heart on her son marrying the family friend? Planning his life out?**

> **OOP:** My MIL definitely had his whole life planned out for him. She wanted to pick his college, then she expected him to move home after, she wanted to pick his wife, she feels entitled to grandkids… She had also consistently asked him about moving back to his home state because they are getting older and she expects him to uproot his whole life to take care of her. He has told her that is absolutely not happening multiple times, he had recently started ending their phone calls if she brought it up.

**OOP responds on her husband being the only child**

> **OOP:** Yup only child! She apparently had wanted multiple kids but couldn’t have any more. So he was her “miracle baby”. My MIL did not want to adopt, she did not want to “end up with anyone’s problem child.” So finding out we couldn’t have (I couldn’t) have bio kids I think was the final nail in my coffin for her… We are happily child free though. I would have totally been open to adoption if we had wanted kids.

1khh5eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/1khh5eg/hi_birthmother_here/,Hi birthmother here,"Hi so I don’t usually post on Reddit but I found this group and I just wanted to share my story,

I 30 AFAB  and my husband 30M place a child for adoption almost 3years ago, we had a very different experience with adoption then most of the story’s I have read on here. We are high school sweethearts and we have never wanted to raise children. And as kids our parents and other family would tell us that we would change our minds in the future.

We never did. When we found out that we were pregnant the first thing my husband says is “it’s your choice I will support you no matter what “  it was an easy decision just because I don’t want to raise children doesn’t mean I can’t help a family have the child that have been dreaming about. When I told my husband this we started looking at adoption agencies. 
We booked an appointment as soon as we found one we liked. Our social worker was amazing she explained that as a rule of the agency as well as the laws in our area the Adoption would be open and the child would always know about the adoption.

My husband and I looked through over 100 family profiles. And 10 home studies. We found a lovely couple who we adored immensely. They fit every thing we wanted in a perspective family, they were kind and understood that due to mine and mine husband genetics that the child would likely have one or more learning disability’s. They said they would love the child unconditionally. And without question they do they have given this child everything my husband and I never had growing up and so much more.

The entire pregnancy felt like a surrogacy and every few weeks until I gave birth we would meet with the prospective parents have coffee/tea and just get to know each other. 
When I went into labor we called them at sometime around 2am i delivered a healthy baby the day after my birthday. I insisted that the doctors let them do skin to skin and to cut the cord. It was a beautiful moment and seeing them hold this tiny infant my heart filled with so much joy and love  I knew that this was the right choice.
To this day we still see them every month and visit over lunch , dinner and sometimes breakfast. There is not a day that we regret this decision.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1kayldv/i_am_meeting_my_ex_best_friend_after_10_years_of/)**: April 29, 2025**

Something really interesting is happening to me (29F). So, when I was 6 years old and I started school, I met a friend named Linda (29F) we were both with no sisters just brothers and we bonded, we lived in a small village so of course our families knew each other and because of us they also grew closer.

So me and Linda were inseparable, we went through high school together (same class), also on the beginning of our studies on the same group. We had other best friends along the way that we made in high school which I still talk to (two of them) and we were a really fun group. But only me and Linda were together in the same university during studies.

This happened until Linda knows someone that she falls in love. He lived abroad and they immediately introduced one another to each other’s families. So, eventually he started pulling Linda away from us, controlling her via gps, controlling who should she hang out with, when, etc. at first, I really liked him because he was the love of my best friend and whenever they had a fight I would try to bring the peace, so he respected me. But, when I saw how controlling he was, I told Linda that I don’t think she should be in that position, I also called him out when he was controlling her and abusing her verbally. When I called him out, he obligated Linda to never hang out with me again (specifically) and slowly divided her from the whole group.

We lived in the same village but I never saw her again, she even stopped studies. Her parents invited me to her wedding and I didn’t want to go, but my parents said we should go for the sake of the family friendship (they invited my parents too).

I saw Linda for the first time after almost a year and a half in a wedding dress, and when we locked eyes we both were emotional and I noticed her eyes full of tears. Her mum and grandmother (who loved me like their own) when they came to greet me, both of them bursted into tears, and that was the last day I saw Linda until she went to live abroad.

For almost 10 years I only saw her twice just in the blink of an eye, and that’s it. I can’t say I didn’t think of her sometimes, in the beginning I thought of her more often but as the years passed by, I thought of her time by time, about her well-being, about her life with that man..

I heard some rumors that she is struggling in marriage but never something specific, that’s until couple months ago when I met her father with her son in our town’s coffee shop. I greeted him.. when I looked at Linda’s son, I asked “is this…” and froze, and her father said “yes, he is”. I asked the little boy if I could hug him, and he said yes, I hugged him, kissed him on the cheek and he hugged me back 🥹. Linda’s father referred to me as “this is your mom’s friend” and that was it about that day..

After some days I heard that she got divorced, she was physically abused, her husband cheated on her, had an affair with her boss (there were rumors they even share a kid together) and that was the last straw for her and decided to end the marriage. The rumors got confirmed by Linda’s mum to my mum at a funeral they met in town. I never could ask about her because I didn’t want to sound like I am happy about her situation or like I want to gossip about her, and to be honest… some kind I was happy for her… not because of what happened to her, but because she got free of him finally!

Not many days passed by when we saw the news of her ex husband’s death. We still don’t know if it was an accident, if he k\*lled himself, or what was the cause of his death, no one ever told that.

This brings us to yesterday when one of our best friends (which is still my best friend, we’ll call her “Ana”) saw Linda in the town and decided to go and talk to her. She called me immediately after and told me every detail. Linda was emotional and on the verge of tears when they met, and they shared contacts and also decided to meet for coffe, them and me, tomorrow🥹. Also, one of other best friend of us (which we still are pretty close) that lives abroad and is in town said she would join too and I never in my whole life imagined our group again together, let alone me and Linda together after 10 years with no contact.

I thought I don’t feel love for her anymore, I didn’t love her nor hate her, but I got this scary feeling for tomorrow, and something inside me is so excited, I feel like I will meet my child self. I never hated her, and I never got angry of her decision to leave me.. I got angry of her decision to ruin her beautiful life that she had created until he came along. And I felt angry and sorry, only for her… but, I know that things happen for a reason so I never judged her for her decisions, it was her life and her mistakes to live. We’re none perfect and we all make stupid decisions, the thing is: heart always go back to her home..

No matter her reaction, cold or warm towards me, I will still try to talk only about our childhood, beautiful things we did, I want her to feel safe and bring to her just a glimpse of her beautiful life into the hard times she is going through.

I am so excited!

***OOP's Only Comment:***

Commenter: Amazing. Just enjoy being with your friend—I bet the years will just disappear.

>**OOP:** I don’t know.. Life happened and it’s been 10 years. She also still lives abroad and Im sure she has a lot going on, since her ex husband died just 3 months ago. I don’t know if I should hope for where we left, but whatever is going to be, it’ll be enough for me

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kccbe5/i_am_meeting_my_ex_best_friend_after_10_years_of/)**: May 1, 2025 (2 days later)**

Hi everybody, I hope you’re all doing good.

Some of you asked for an update about me meeting my friend.

The meeting was yesterday and it went better than I imagined. We had to meet after I finish my shift and through all day I felt a little mixed emotions. I didn’t know how she would react when she sees me. “Ana” and her scheduled the place and time to meet all of us, and when I went there they were already talking and greeting each other. I told myself that no matter what, I will give Linda a warm and long hug, and after that if I feel her uncomforted I will take a step back.

She hugged me back and at first, it felt good but a little strange, like I am hugging an unknown person, but after some seconds it felt like I am hugging the Linda I know.

We walked just a little until we decided where to sit for coffee, and I didn’t want to ask anything about what she’ve been going through, I wanted our “first” meet to be filled with laughs and good memories. Ana didn’t ask her either, we went straight to being our teenage selfs, being silly and mocking each other (of course in a good way).

Linda at first felt a little uncomfortable because I know she felt guilty about how things ended between us without an explanation, without saying goodbye, without any reason, but, when she saw us being completely ourselves like we used to be when she left us, she started opening up, being more comfortable and laughing with us.

I didn’t want to sound like I don’t care about her life at all, so I asked if she is working, how her son is and things like this in general, and when she started to openly talk she was on the verge of tears, but didn’t cry.

I feel like she felt like she “owes” us an explanation on what happened with her life, what she’ve been through, but I told her “let’s make today only about good things, whatever happened to you is now gone, and I know you are so strong, and so loved and supported, and I know you are in a better place than you were, and all I care about is this, seeing you good”.

She told us a glimpse of what she’ve been through, how she was obligated to sneaky leave just with the clothes she was wearing, some things for her son and her aunt that lived in the same state took her and opened her home for Linda and her son. She did a restraining order and told the police she had to leave because of the physically & verbally abuse, so she could take full custody of her son. She won the case and asked for her son to meet her father only supervised by authorities.

She was really struggling to find a place of her own and had to live with her aunt for a while, until she found a small apartment near her and moved there. She found a retail job part time, and since then Linda and her son are living together.

I asked how her ex died, and she said she don’t know because she was fully no contact with him and her in laws, changed her number, got out of all social media and until an unknown number called to tell her he is dead, she didn’t have an idea. They said that he died from heart attack, but that’s all she knows about his death, she also didn’t believe her ex sis in law when she called to inform her about his death, Linda said “don’t bother me” and hung up.

After a while the news was confirmed and she believed that he actually died and of course she was devastated.

Her telling the story got me teared up and I told her that the most important thing is that she is doing better, and to never ever look back on the past, just in the future.

We then changed the subject and talked about old times, joked, laughed, just like back in the time. Our third best friend came later but still managed to spend time together all of us, like nothing has changed.

My house and her parents house are nearby and we drove together at our town and I said I would like to meet her son just for a few minutes outside the door, just so I could hug him and go.

We went, and her grandmother, her mother, her whole family were out, hugging me and inviting me over. Her son hugged me, he was a little bit shy, but I didn’t like to push him to be closer so I just hugged him, and let him be.

I went inside just for 5 mins but ended staying almost 40 min, talking with her family, laughing, telling old stories, it felt just like when we used to hang out back then.

After that Linda dropped me home and she had to leave first thing in the morning. She said she’ll be back during summer and we’ll definitely meet, I told her she can call me whenever she wants.

We hugged, said goodbye and that’s the whole story.

I felt so happy, I felt like she needed this so much, as much as we did, and I am so glad we are again in touch.

1khgt1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1khgt1t/i_was_falsely_accused_for_sexual_harassment/,I was falsely accused for sexual harassment.,"When I was a first year medical student, I used to have a regular study spot near a smoothie shop affiliated with the school that I visited daily. One day, before leaving, I asked a girl who worked there if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. At the time, I had no idea you should never try to date someone who works at a place you frequent. I must of been labeled a creep in her eyes. She hated seeing me study there or something bc of the one incident.

2 months later she ended up making up several false claims about me and told her management, who knew I was a medical student. Management then contacted my school. She alleged that I repeatedly asked for her number and offered to walk her to her car at night, none of which was true. The only time I asked for a coffee was 2 months before that. I spoke with the school’s Title IX office, and they told me to ensure something like that didn’t happen again. I said, “Okay. I will be extra careful and won't try to get anymore dates with anyone affiliated with the school."" I was allowed to go back to the smoothie shop I was not trespassed or anything, but they warned me to be careful. I never went back.

Two years later, while I was at the hospital heading to didactics (our teaching sessions outside of rotations), I walked into a room the didactic room that was still empty and thought, “Oh ,weird  no one’s here yet.” Suddenly, security approached me and said I was being trespassed. I asked why, and they said they didn’t know but that I was no longer allowed on the property. They walked me to my car, and I turned in my badge.

I emailed my school, and a few hours later, they called me. They said a female student had accused me of staring at her breasts.  I had no idea what was going on. I asked who had made the accusation, and they wouldn’t tell me.

I eventually appeared before a panel of doctors at my school. I told them the truth: I had no idea what this was about, and I hadn’t done anything. I suspected I was being misinterpreted because I’m slightly on the autism spectrum, but I hadn’t stared at anyone, and I didn’t even know who was accusing me or when it supposedly happened. All I did was go to the hospital and was trespassed. I walked through every interaction I had with someone on the day I was trespassed.

They brought up the previous incident, and again I told the truth. I said I didn't stare at anyone. They asked how I thought she felt and said they didn’t believe I acted with intent. They issued a six-month Title IX suspension. I was also required to undergo therapy and see a doctor to assess whether I was mentally fit to return to the program. This would of also ruined my chances of getting into a good residency.

I confided in a friend another medical student who happened to know some students at the hospital I worked at. He reached out and found out that the accuser before didactics apparently said I was staring at her breasts to about nine students and the didactic lecturer. The doctor then reported it to the hospital, and everyone moved to another room. That was when I was trespassed.

While I was getting trespassed and they were in the other room with the 9 other students my friend said the girl ended up crying in tears. She said “He doesn’t deserve this,” but also claimed to have been a prostitute before medical school. She made up additional lies about me, said I had been in front of the school board multiple times(which was not true), and even referenced the earlier incident something I had never told anyone about, which was unsettling and weird. I have no idea how she knew about it.

I appealed to the school and requested a Title IX investigation. They agreed and interviewed the other students, who apparently supported my version of events.

I eventually spoke with a Title IX investigator, who told me the incident supposedly occurred during lunch on a day different from when I had assumed and wrote up my defense about. After speaking with me, the investigator apologized for how I had been treated and said they would resolve the matter quickly.

The Title IX suspension was ultimately removed due to insufficient evidence.

The worst part? The date and time  they said the incident occurred I wasn’t even at the hospital. I was at a nearby Mr. Jim’s. I also was rarely in the same room as the girl and barely spoke to her out side of how are you doing today.

Sweat while showering. Sweat while cooking in the kitchen too. 
I sweat like crazy just walking. I also have crazy anxiety. 
I melt like crazy before I even start doing a warmup in the gym. Its causing me a lot of distress. 

So far I’ve stopped drinking hot beverages like tea or coffee before going out and that sort of reduces my sweating a little bit. I do have spicy food but I like it too much to switch to a bland diet. 

I do make it a point to find the AC wherever I go but that doesn’t always work. 

Sitting down and breathing reduces my sweating a little too. Sometimes. There needs to be air though, fan even. 

I was wondering if this is happening because my body is just not adjusting to the climate of the place I live in currently? 
Growing up, there was centralized air conditioning everywhere and I’m wondering if thats why my heat tolerance is very low and if that has something to do with my intense sweating? 

Or is it because my heart rate goes up quickly and my stamina is bad? Or is the weight? I know there is no way to know for sure unless I work on each and every one of them. And strike them out. 

But. There must be some hacks right? To cool your body down quicker?

In both apps, I'm using SF Pro Rounded for headers. For the body text, I use Inter in Bear and then SF Pro in Obsidian. I use iFont to load the same fonts in Bear on my iPhone and iPad.

The specific recommendations I made are as follows, all based on the Obsidian screenshot (right).

1. **I recommend that they increase the font weight for bold text.** In many fonts used in Bear, the bold just isn't *bold enough*, bleeding into the standard font weight. It's hard to tell when text is bold. (I use Inter in Bear over SF Pro specifically because bold text stands out more.) In my Obsidian theme, the bold text has a CSS font weight of 600 over the regular text's weight of 400.
2. **Increase the color contrast of bold text from standard text.** In Bear, the regular text font color is used of bold text as well. Changing that (I use white in the example to the right) has it stand out more, adding to the prominence given based on the weight.
3. **Increase the contrast of italics text from standard, and bump the weight just a bit.** In my Obsidian customization, I also made italic text white, and the font weight is 500.
4. **Allow the paragraph spacing and list spacing to be independently controllable.** Right now the spacing configuration applies to *both*, but the spacing for list items always reads better when it's tighter than paragraphs.
   * In Bear, I have the paragraph spacing to ZERO — any larger gives list items breathing room, but paragraphs end up with way too much space. The screenshot below is what happens when you have 0.6em paragraph spacing — nicer list spacing, poorer paragraph spacing).

At the end of the day, Bear does wonderful things with text and its reading experience has all kinds of butter goodness. But IMHO these little details *matter* and can provide a huge improvement. The user experience of Bear's native iOS app is far more delightful than Obsidian (though that app has other benefits), but I love reading text in Obsidian because of the enhancements I've been able to make.

Anyhow, just my $0.2 — happy to hear it's resonated with some. And absolutely love Bear and the work the devs have done. A fantastic app and one of my long-standing favorites. I recommend it a ton and continue to use it to this day.

I feel like throwing up except nothing comes out.  I just lie in bed in emotional agony. 

I went out for coffee after work today. I ran into an acquaintance and we talked for a bit around some coffee, it was nice. Then I went for a walk by the river and sat with the ducks. I wanted to cry but I couldn’t. All I did was stare at the surface of the water in disbelief that it was real, that anything around me was real. 

I have blocked my ex everywhere, I go to the gym frequently, I journal, I hang out with my friends, I take my antidepressants. I feel like I’m doing everything right, but I’m yielding no results. Just rage, despair and a brand new kind of emotional pain. I never knew a betrayal could affect me this much, until D-day I would not have considered myself to be a resentful person in a million years. I asked him to give back a scarf that I had knitted him right before D-day, I just wanted it back because I needed a sense of justice for myself. I put a lot of time and love into that scarf. I wanted it back, but he refused because he said it was a gift. It’s just a freaking scarf, it’s so trivial, but it was symbolic to me, and his refusal to give it back was the nail in the coffin. 

I didn’t know it was possible to be in this much emotional pain. When does it end? Does the ruminating ever stop? Thinking about them being intimate makes me feel like someone is twisting a blade through my insides. I’m just screaming into the void right now but I feel so powerless and would love some words of encouragement. It feels like I’m going insane and I don’t know where to turn.

I live in Austin Texas and I have a huge passion for coffee and want to eventually open my own shop. The goal is to become a manager of sorts to get experience before I venture out on my own so I can know kind of what to expect vs just going blind. 
So back to the question, there is an available position open at a shop that isn’t too far from me. The catch is that I’ve heard the owners of this shop aren’t that great and I’m worried about that and what I could do to my overall outlook. At the same time tho, it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. 
What do yall think? Give it a shot, take a leap and get the experience or stay away if I’ve heard it’s not an amazing place to work?
Currently am working as a barista, I was a shift lead most of college and last year, left a previous job due to management causing a bunch of drama and a pretty bad schedule. I make 21.5 $ rn and base pay at this new job is 20+ tips with around 25-28 as the range

1khglgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1khglgi/literary_journey_through_time_jack_finneys_time/,"Literary Journey Through Time: Jack Finney's ""Time and Again""","When I first picked up ""Time and Again"" by Jack Finney, I wasn't expecting to be transported so completely—not just to 1882 New York, but to that peculiar mental space where fiction feels more real than the world around you. You know the feeling, right? When your coffee goes cold because you're too engrossed in turning pages to remember it exists?

Finney's novel is often celebrated as one of the most elegantly crafted time travel stories ever written, and after spending time with Simon Morley, I understand why. This isn't your typical sci-fi romp with fancy machines and blinking lights. Instead, Finney gives us time travel through self-hypnosis—a psychological journey rather than a technological one. How refreshingly human in a genre that often prioritizes gadgets over growth.
What struck me most was how Finney uses New York City itself as a character. The Dakota apartment building becomes more than just a staging area—it's a temporal gateway, a structure straddling two centuries with equal authenticity. As I read about Si gazing out those windows at Central Park, I found myself wondering which spaces in my own city might harbor such timeless pockets. Haven't you ever stood in an old building and felt the weight of history pressing in from all sides? Finney captures that sensation perfectly.

The novel balances its historical tourism with genuine human stakes. Si's mission begins as simple observation, but as with all great adventures, what starts as curiosity evolves into something far more profound. The emotional complexity deepens with each page, raising questions about where—and when—we truly belong.
Finney's attention to historical detail is nothing short of remarkable. The inclusion of period illustrations (attributed to Si's artistic talents) creates an immersive authenticity that few historical novels achieve. Reading about Si wandering through old Manhattan, I could practically smell the coal smoke and hear the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages. It's the kind of vivid scene-setting that makes you look up from the book and feel momentarily disoriented to find yourself in the present.
""I have been in New York for less than a day, and already I feel the city folding around me like a familiar coat,"" Si observes early in his journey, and Finney makes readers feel the texture of that coat in exquisite detail. The gaslit streets, the formal manners, the heightened sense of propriety—all rendered with such precision that the past becomes as tangible as the present.
What sets ""Time and Again"" apart from other time travel narratives is its thoughtful meditation on the nature of history itself. Most sci-fi treats the past as either a playground or a puzzle box—something to be enjoyed or solved. Finney instead presents history as a living, breathing entity with which we can engage directly. The novel asks: If we could step into the past, would we be mere observers, or would we become participants? And if participants, what responsibilities would that entail?
This philosophical dimension elevates what might otherwise be a simple adventure story into something more profound. As Si becomes increasingly invested in the lives of those he meets in 1882, we're confronted with questions about connection, intervention, and the butterfly effects of our smallest actions. The moral complexity grows alongside the narrative tension, creating a reading experience that's intellectually stimulating as well as emotionally engaging.

The love story that develops adds yet another dimension to the temporal exploration. There's something achingly poignant about connections formed across the boundaries of time—they highlight the universality of human emotion while simultaneously underscoring the cultural differences that separate eras. Finney handles this delicate balance masterfully, avoiding both anachronism and alienation.

After finishing the novel, I found myself looking differently at historical photographs, wondering about the lives captured in those frozen moments. ""Time and Again"" has that rare quality of changing how you perceive the world long after you've closed its covers. I've caught myself studying the architecture of older buildings more carefully, imagining what it would be like to see them in their prime.
For anyone who's ever walked through an old neighborhood and felt that strange tingle of temporal displacement, or stared at a vintage photograph long enough to imagine stepping into it—this novel will speak to you. Finney hasn't just written about time travel; he's created a literary time machine between two covers.

What I appreciated most, perhaps, was Finney's resistance to technological solutions. In an age obsessed with gadgets and scientific explanations, there's something wonderfully subversive about a time travel method based on psychology and perception. It suggests that the barriers between now and then may be more permeable than we imagine—that with enough knowledge, focus, and desire, we might bridge temporal gaps through sheer force of will.
Isn't there something captivating about that possibility? That the key to visiting another time might lie not in some complicated machine but in our own minds? It's the kind of concept that lingers with you, making you wonder as you walk past historical landmarks if you could, with sufficient concentration, slip sideways into another era.

""Time and Again"" offers not just entertainment but a gentle invitation to see your surroundings with new eyes—to recognize the layers of time present in every street, building, and park. It's a book that makes you feel like a time traveler in your own life, more attuned to the historical echoes resonating around you.",1,1746675141.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

It’s an app that is an alarm that makes you do something to turn it off essentially and it doesn’t stop ringing until you do it. I use the free version
Here’s my routine 
1. Set iPhone alarm 3 min before Alarmy alarm. This gives me a second to wake up but not enough time to change my alarmy alarm
2. Alarmy goes off and I rush downstairs (I set the most obnoxious ringtone and it gets louder the longer it plays) bc in order turn it off, I have to take a photo of my coffee machine where I keep my meds and water. Take them immediately because I’m there and make coffee immediately. Then make breakfast immediately. Do not let myself go back to bed. 
3. Second iPhone alarm is set 5 min before I have to leave 
4.  Alarmy alarm is set at time i MUST BE OUT THE DOOR and to unlock it i have to take a picture of my car door handle. This helps me leave on time!! (Bc sometimes even if wake up on time I’m still late bc time blindness) 

The reason I also set my iPhone alarm is because it gives me a warning for the very loud alarmy alarm and also one time the alarmy alarm glitched and didn’t go off so I make sure that I set a regular alarm just in case. 

Anyways highly recommend this app it helped tremendously into forcing me awake and to leave on time!! ",3,1746675047.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

There was no formal agenda or case study provided, like there has been in the prior interviews, and the coordinator simply shared that they wanted me to meet him. I would have felt more comfortable in a café setting, where it wouldn't be awkward to have notes and questions in front of me. Should I just go noteless? Or do I crack a notebook open over eggs Benedict?
And, what do I eat?! I'm not much of a morning/breakfast person in general, so coffee with protein powder is usually it for me until lunch. It seems a bit rude to not order a whole meal if he intentionally chose this spot over the café. But what if I order something that seems too indulgent? What if I order oatmeal, then accidentally talk with my mouth open? What if I go to cut something, scrape my knife on the plate, and make his ears bleed?

Also, do I offer or try to pay? For both of us or just myself? I would assume he'll just cover it as a regular business expense, like a meal with a client, but it also seems like it could be presumptuous on my part to just expect it.

I've been in my current role for 4.5 years, fully remote including the interviews, and I'm a little nervous about an interview in person... then we have to add breakfast interview complexities on top of that.",1,1746674341.0,interviews,2,1.0,False

**Pause and Serve Feature:** The machine incorporates a pause and serve function, allowing users to pour a cup of coffee mid-brew without making a mess.

I've struggled for the past 5 years with a messed-up sleep pattern. Most days, I’d stay awake all night and sleep during the day. Sometimes I'd be up until 3 AM and sleep until 2 PM or 11 PM, it was completely out of my control.

I tried various prescriptions my doctor recommended like melatonin, haloperidol, and even antipsychotics like aripiprazole and quetiapine. I also used a lot of coffee and Red Bull to fix my schedule, but nothing worked.

A few days ago, I randomly slept from 3 PM to 6:30 PM, and it was full REM sleep, my dreams were vivid and weird, but not lucid. Then, out of nowhere, I felt super sleepy at 12 AM, plugged in my phone, and slept for 5 hours straight. Again, it felt like full REM. I woke up multiple times during the night, but by 5 AM I was fully awake and energetic, something I’ve never felt before.

Now I wake up early, go for walks, and watch the sunrise every day. Life has felt great this past week.

**What’s the Real Deal with “Make Her Horny with Humor - Bobby Rio & Rob Judge”?**  
If you've ever heard that women love funny guys, you're not alone—but most dudes have no clue what *kind* of funny actually works when it comes to attraction. That’s where *Make Her Horny with Humor - Bobby Rio & Rob Judge* comes in. This course isn’t about cracking stand-up jokes or trying to be the next Kevin Hart. It’s about using humor in a very *intentional* way to spark chemistry, create connection, and take things from friendly to flirty… then sexual. Basically, this is humor as a seduction weapon.

**Why This Course Exists (And Why It’s So Damn Useful)**  
So why did they make this course? Simple: a ton of guys mess up humor. Either they overdo it, use the wrong style, or don't know *when* to transition to something a bit more seductive. Bobby and Rob wanted to demystify that. They break humor down phase by phase—what to use when you first meet her, what to say when things are heating up, and how to not ruin your chances by making jokes that kill the vibe. The course offers five core audio modules (around 40 mins each), one bonus module, and a handy eBook with the full breakdown.

**Who Should Check Out This Course?**  
If you’ve ever gotten stuck in the “funny friend zone” or felt like you had good banter but couldn’t take it anywhere beyond laughs, then this course is basically made for you. Guys who are naturally witty but not seductive? You’ll learn how to shift that dynamic. Total beginners? You’ll get templates and timing tricks that’ll make this stuff easy. *Make Her Horny with Humor - Bobby Rio & Rob Judge* really shines for dudes who want to bridge the gap between casual joking and genuine chemistry.

**Where Does the Magic Happen?**  
The “magic” here happens in everyday convo—bars, dates, text chats, even that awkward moment at a coffee shop. The beauty of this system is that it’s about using subtle, smart, *sexualized humor* in normal interactions. You don’t need a stage or spotlight. You just need to understand the psychological tricks and delivery style to make it land right.

**When Should You Use What Type of Humor?**  
Timing is everything. One huge win from this course is that it teaches you not only *what* to say but *when*. For instance, if you’re teasing too much at the wrong stage, you risk annoying her instead of turning her on. But with proper calibration (which this course explains in a very chill, non-robotic way), you’ll be able to smoothly ride the wave from funny to flirty to hot. There’s even a rough timeline—like when to pivot 30-35 minutes in—which is super helpful for newbies.

**How the Heck Do You Actually Get Her Horny with Humor?**  
Let’s be real: the title’s a little bold. But they back it up. The key? Set the expectation early that you're a flirt. Bobby and Rob dive into “The Theory of Expectations,” showing how people quickly lock you into a role. So if you start off as the funny *sexual* guy, she’ll expect you to keep being that guy—and she’ll respond in kind. The humor becomes a bridge to intimacy, not just entertainment.

**Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?**  
For sure, *Make Her Horny with Humor - Bobby Rio & Rob Judge* is one of the most practical deep dives into seductive humor out there. It’s not perfect—some material overlaps with their other products like Seductive Storytelling—but if you’re a guy who wants to upgrade your flirty banter into something more impactful (and sexier), this is definitely a worthy pickup. You’ll laugh, learn, and maybe even land a date or two.",1,1746673497.0,NiloStudying,1,1.0,False

1khg1ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1khg1ju/tipsmy_account_what_i_learned_so_far_from/,(Tips/My Account) What I learned so far from carliving in Cali!,"Twoish months in. First few weeks sucked ass.

I'd wake up and, once that hazy transition between being asleep and awake wore off, I'd remember, damn, I really live in my car now, what the fuck has my life become? I'd dwell in that mood of not belonging daily and project it everywhere, like, oh, everyone knows and is judging me and I can't stay in one place for too long and I have to be extra careful and extra kind and yada yada. I was about as paranoid as cat on crack lol.

It hasnt gone away completely, but I definitely got used to it once I found a routine and some sleeping/chilling spots to rotate between. Here's my routine in case anyone is curious.

First things first, when I wake up in the mornings, I doordash until the library opens. I stay at the library from opening (9amsish) to closing (5pmish). This is where I get all my productive shit done and out of the way. I put my electronics to charge, write, read, study, apply for jobs, read some more, take a snack break, read, and boom, closing time. I end up chilling in my car in the library parking for an hour or so after closing to kill time and what not. After that, I drive to a nearby river and connect with nature, clearing my head, going for a walk, taking a swim, fishing, chilling in my car, and doomscrolling haha. And when the sun sets, it's time to either DoorDash some more or drive to Planet Fitness to workout, shower, and, again, charge my electronics. Finally, I drive to either a rest area or residential area where my car can blend in and I hit the hay. I found rest areas to be the most comfortable.

I make sure rotate libraries, rest areas, residential areas, gyms, and rivers. I don't really have to, but 1) I live in an area with many in close proximity and 2) it just makes me feel less paranoid and at ease.

Dreaded encounters with the cops usually only happen when I'm parked in a public parking lot or when I'm driving at night. If I get approached or pulled over I either tell them 1) I'm doordashing and waiting for orders to come in and I show them the app, or 2) I tell them I lost track of time after shopping or eating, and I keep a souvenir from a nearby restaurant or grocery store, usually a bag pulled from the trash or a meal I bought just to subtly show them I'm here for a purpose. I avoid cop encounters by not driving for too long or by not parking at public parking lots and instead doing what I mentioned in my daily routine.

For food, I live in Norcal and found shopping at Grocery Outlet and Dollar Tree is the best option for cheap and somewhat healthy food and drinks. Grocery Outlets often have great deals too. Yesterday, I found $0.79 Chamberlain coffee cans with 70ish MG of caffeine, a small $0.79 ham packet, a $1.10 water gallon jug, $2 Ghost Protein cereal, and a ton of other shit.

What else, what else, hmmm...

On keeping my car clean: I keep a scrub brush for the carpets because I dont wanna keep paying for vacuum hoses; I keep a trash bag in the backseat; I give my car free washes with gas station squeegees when pumping gas; I keep all my bags and clothes and belongings and whatnot in the trunk, out of sight, so no one suspects I live in here; I wet a rag and add a bit a soap to clean the dash boards and plastic upholstery; this isn't really necessary and they are a bit expensive (like 4ish dollars) but I keep a fabric spray on me at all times to spray the seats and headliner and keep my car smelling clean because little shit like that goes a long way for my mental health... also because a cop once pulled me over for having a fucking scent tree hanging on the rear view lmfao.

On keeping good mental health: I vent via my creative writing from time to time; I found having a purpose, a goal to chase, and pursuing it relentlessly helps me when I'm feeling down, and that goal is writing for me; I turn my phone off and spend time in nature, jumping in cold river water is like a mental reset fr fr, being surrounded by trees and smelling fresh cold oxygen is also great, stepping barefeet in grass or sand or slimy underwater pebbles/rocks is grounding; working out helps me feel good about myself; eating reletively healthy goes a long long way, trust me, that mind and body link is real, you are what you eat. And, overall, I try to spend as little time in my car as possible.

On my sex life because why not and I did see a few discussions about it: Yes, I'm sexually active, not as much as pre-carliving though. Yes, I fuck in my car. Fuck buying motels, I'm too broke for that lmfao. Also, carplay is not unheard of, especially if it's a one night stand late at night, you'd be surprised how many people are down for car sex, though, tbf, I am still young so that may be a factor. I sell them with a late night car drive where we listen to music and chat and vibe and then we find a place to park/sightsee and one thing leads to the back seat and boom. Limited positions though hahaha. So, yeah, carplay. I just don't tell them I live in my car and I keep myself clean/presentable ofc.

On hygiene: I shower at Planet Fitness and when I can't, I shower in the river lmfao. When I don't feel like showering, I clean myself with Dollar Tree washcloths. I pee and shit in fastfood restaurants (some are closed, but if I ask kindly and tell them I'm a doordasher, they give me the code), public restrooms (rivers, rest areas, and parks have public restrooms), and at Planet Fitness. I've never needed to shit late at night, but if I did, a 24-hour Planet Fitness or an always open rest area restroom would be the best bet. Use baby wipes btw! It's much cleaner! Obviously, I keep all other essentials like toothbrush, floss, deodorant, conditioner, soap, etc. I do my laundry at the laundromat, but tbh, I'm tempted to try washing my clothes old fashioned style in the river to see if I can save money, idk.

Uhhh, what else... Yeah that's all I can think of for now. Hope this helps anyone!!

Edit, I thought of more to add:

The biggest obstacle I've faced so far was my car breaking down. That shit sucked, but I looked on Facebook Marketplace and found a somewhat affordable mobile mechanic, he charged way less than an actual shop. Another obstacle I faced was running out of gas, but I asked a friend and she lended me some money. Always pay your debts!!

So far, I've been doordashing for money, but from time to time I'd flip free shit I got from the app Freebie Alerts. It's a learning curb. Some items sell, some don't. Fitness items are always in demand. Resell on Facebook Marketplace or Offerup. Also, sell stuff you don't need!",25,1746673318.0,urbancarliving,6,0.96,False

These type of posts helped me a lot in planning my trip, so paying it forward! 6 day solo trip from 4/29-5/5
Day 1: Landed 4/29 about 12pm dropped off luggage and made my way to OSJ. Did Castillo San Felipe del Morro. Absolutely beautiful! Went back to hotel for lunch and check in—stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn San Juan Condado. Got freshened up and went to dinner at Santaella. The quesadilla appetizer was AMAZING. 
Day 2: Scheduled a tour of El Yunque that was unfortunately cancelled, I’m assuming because of weather as it rained on and off the whole week I was there. Pivoted and did the Museo de Arte Puerto Rico. If you’re an art enthusiast even a little bit, I highly recommend! Absolutely beautiful and so much to see. I was there about 2 hours, I probably could’ve spent another two just taking everything in. Had lunch at Bebo’s cafe and was probably the best I had the whole trip. The pernils were out of this world! Spent the rest of the evening at the pool at the hotel enjoying the beautiful weather.
Day 3: booked an early ferry to Vieques, took an  uber to Ceiba—ferry was a very straightforward process. After arriving in Vieques, picked up my jeep rental and grabbed some breakfast at Kristy’s cafe. I highly recommend renting a jeep for getting around the island, I couldn’t imagine trying to get around without it. The roads are super uneven and tough to drive on, it would have been extremely difficult in something else. It was raining most of the morning, but once it cleared up a bit I headed to Sun Bay Beach. It was nice, stayed for a bit and swam and hung out, then moved to Playa Caracas. Caracas was absolutely stunning, definitely the most beautiful beach of my stay. After I checked into my hotel Old Crow Hotel and Suites. Super centrally located and beautiful property, a nice kitchenette that would have been helpful if I was staying longer and a whole patio with a Mountain View. I did dinner at Duffy’s and did the bio bay tour. Not only was the bio bay really cool but it was also incredible to see the sky with no light pollution as well. All the stars were so bright. 
Day 4: had a somewhat early ferry, so checked out of Old Crow and dropped off jeep. Got a pastellito and coffee at Panaderia Lydia by the ferry station that was delicious! After the ferry I was able to easily get an uber to El Conquistador. They allowed me to check in early (around 12pm when check in is 4) and I had made a reservation for a massage at the spa. Super relaxing and enjoyable! That night was unfortunately rainy again so I got some room service and just enjoyed an evening in the room. 
Day 5: woke up early for breakfast at Ventanas on the property and took the funicular to the water park. Despite it being small I spent several hours there taking turns relaxing on the beach chairs/the infinity pool and taking the slides down and going round and round the lazy river. Then I moved to the main pool area and enjoyed the hot tub and the big pools and swim up bar. Then had a dinner at Sicilia with some pasta! 
Day 6: got a small breakfast and then took the ferry out to the private Palomino Island and enjoyed a full beach day there. The water was lovely and thankfully had a full day of sun. I wanted to get out of the resort to do Estación for dinner but unfortunately couldn’t secure a ride, so just did dinner by the pool. 
Day 7: checked out early and stored luggage at SJU in order to spend a few more hours in OSJ prior to my flight around 1pm. Got some breakfast at La Mallorca and just strolled around the town to see the architecture and a few more beautiful views. 

Just wanted to thank the kind regulars of this sub that helped me plan such a relaxing trip with tons of amazing things to do! I can’t wait to go back! ",3,1746673259.0,PuertoRicoTravel,1,1.0,False

# Why Thoughtful Matters: Avoiding Generic Last-Minute Mother’s Day Gifts

Photo by [RDNE Stock project](https://www.pexels.com/@rdne)

Mother’s Day isn’t just about giving a present — it’s about showing appreciation in a way that feels true to your relationship. While it’s tempting to grab flowers or a mug at the last minute, these fallback gifts are often forgotten as quickly as they’re unwrapped. The [best last-minute Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4d3yQlQ) don’t have to be expensive or elaborate. What matters is the thought behind the gift, especially when time is short.

# The Problem with Rushed, Generic Gifts

Choosing a quick, standard gift — like grocery store flowers or a generic gift card — can unintentionally send the message that you ran out of ideas or simply forgot. No one wants Mom to feel like an afterthought. Gift-giving is a form of communication, and generic choices usually say, “I didn’t have time.”

* **Forgettable:** Mass-produced gifts don’t stand out. They usually gather dust or get re-gifted.
* **Impersonal:** A gift that doesn’t reflect your mom’s interests feels empty, even if it’s practical.
* **Lost Meaning:** The real value in a gift comes from the story or emotion attached. If you grab something in five minutes, there isn’t much to remember or cherish.

As highlighted by researchers in [“The hidden meaning of Mother’s Day gifts”](https://chicago.suntimes.com/other-views/2024/05/10/mothers-day-gift-daughters-moms-psychology-hidden-meanings-chih-ling-liu-robert-kozinets-the-conversation), even well-intentioned quick gifts can come off as generic if they don’t show real effort or connection.

# Why Thoughtful Choices Make an Impact

A thoughtful gift — no matter how quickly chosen — shows you pay attention. Moms can tell when you’ve picked a present just for them. It’s less about the dollars spent, more about the time and heart.

* **Shared Memories:** Items that reflect an inside joke or favorite tradition stand out.
* **Practicality with a Twist:** Useful gifts, like kitchen gifts for mom, are stronger when they clearly suit her needs or hobbies.
* **Personal Touches:** A quick customized note or photo print adds warmth to almost anything.

Even if you only have a couple of hours, you can find [unique Mother’s Day gift ideas that feel special](https://amzn.to/451v2zz). Many curated lists of practical Mother’s Day gifts focus on items that combine utility with a dash of personalization, so you don’t have to sacrifice meaning for speed. Check out these [“practical Mother’s Day gifts that are useful and thoughtful](https://amzn.to/3GJsITW)” for inspiration.

# Striking the Balance: Quick But Meaningful

If you’re tight on time, it’s still possible to hit both speed and significance. Here’s how:

1. **Think About Her Interests**: Jot down what she loves — gardening, coffee, baking, reading — and start there.
2. **Add a Personal Note**: A handwritten card changes even a simple gift into something memorable.
3. **Choose Quality over Quantity**: A single, well-chosen gift means more than a pile of stuff.
4. **Include a Shared Experience**: An IOU for breakfast together or a walk in the park can be more meaningful than a physical present.

For last-minute Mother’s Day gift ideas that check every box, browse curated guides like the [“best last-minute gifts”](https://amzn.to/3EYuQqg), which highlight presents you can buy today and get tomorrow — without feeling rushed.

Putting care into even a quick mothers day present sends the message that Mom truly matters. This is the heart of the search for the best gifts to get your mom and what makes the best first time mom gifts so personal. Thoughtful beats rushed — every single time.

1khfjti,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1khfjti/solved_question_from_one_of_archived_reddit_posts/,Solved. Question from one of Archived reddit posts that went unanswered,"A client dropped coffee on the laptop and tried to clean it with a paper towel, but now the client is having problems with the cursor. You turn off the device to limit damage. What is the next thing you should do to continue troubleshooting the issue?

a. Quickly back up the data.

b. Remove the battery

c. Replace the keyboard

d. Let it dry for 24hrs

The correct answer is d. Let it dry for 24hrs.

After turning off the device to limit damage from the coffee spill, the next step is to let the laptop dry completely for at least 24 hours to prevent further damage from moisture. This ensures that no residual liquid causes short circuits or corrosion when the device is powered on again.

Here’s why the other options are not the best next step:

a. Quickly back up the data: Backing up data is important, but powering on the device before it’s fully dry could cause further damage, making this step premature.

b. Remove the battery: While removing the battery can help prevent electrical damage, it’s not always feasible (e.g., many modern laptops have non-removable batteries), and letting the device dry is a more universally applicable next step.

c. Replace the keyboard: Replacing the keyboard assumes the issue is isolated to it, but the cursor problem could stem from other components affected by the spill, and this step is too advanced without further diagnosis.

Letting it dry minimizes risk and is the safest immediate action before further troubleshooting.

Ever find yourself staring at your retirement plan like it’s an unsolved Rubik's cube? 🤔 Trust me, you’re not alone! One of the biggest decisions you’ll face as you approach that golden age of relaxation is—drumroll, please—what to do with your pension payout. Lump sum or monthly income? 

Let’s break it down together because this can feel like choosing between chocolate or vanilla ice cream (but hey, we can have both if we play our cards right). 🍦 

Here’s the scoop:

### **Lump Sum Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**
- **Big Picture Freedom:** You get **one big check**! Think of all the things you could fund: travel, starting a small business, or maybe that fancy car you’ve had your eye on. 🚗💨
- **Investment Opportunities:** You can invest that lump sum and potentially watch it grow (just remember, no one wants to invest all their savings into the next Beanie Baby craze). 

**Cons:**
- **Decision Overload:** With great power comes great responsibility. You’ll need to manage your funds wisely—no pressure, right? 
- **Risk of Running Out:** If you’re like me and have a penchant for long dinners out and spontaneous Europe trips, the thought of this can be a teensy bit scary. 🥖✈️

### **Monthly Income Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**
- **Steady Stream:** Think of it as your monthly coffee budget! You’ll have a **consistent paycheck** coming in, so you can plan your budget without breaking a sweat. ☕✨ 
- **Less Stress:** Reduces the “What if I run out of money” anxiety. Always a plus in my book.

**Cons:**
- **Less Flexibility:** You won't get to ride the financial roller coaster quite as much. No lump sums means you might miss out on larger opportunities. 
- **Inflation Worries:** Over time, those monthly payments may not stretch as far as they did when you first retired. Can you say *cost of living adjustments*? 

Just like they say, **“Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.”** (You can even check this out for a productivity boost: [Sunsama](https://try.sunsama.com/gdnn6ll0lczp)😉). Now, that’s a mindset for our retirement decisions too!

### **So, What’s the Game Plan?**
- **Do a Needs Assessment:** Honestly evaluate what your lifestyle will look like. Are you dreaming of extravagant travel, or is it more about peace and quiet with a cup of tea? ☕🧘‍♂️
- **Consult with Professionals:** No one has to navigate this maze alone. Get a good financial advisor who can break it down (without sounding like they’re speaking Martian).
- **Visualize Your Future:** Picture how you want to spend those years. You might find it leads you to one option or the other.

So, what do you think? Are you leaning towards a lump sum for that sweet freedom, or are you cozying up to the idea of a steady paycheck? Let’s chat about it! I’d love to hear your thoughts or personal stories on how you’re navigating this decision.",1,1746671519.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1khfdyc,https://i.redd.it/mav9n718ugze1.jpeg,What do I do with the front of my long ranch house???,"This house came with a 10'x23' front deck that's rotting and will be torn out.  But we don't really use that space as a deck...likely only need 2 chairs and a little table out there for seating.  We DO use it to put firewood on in the winter as we partially heat with wood, though.  So, in the winter we stack our wood on it, and the rest of the year it's mainly used as a walkway to get from the front door to the driveway, and sometimes I sit out there with a book or some coffee.

In the front of the deck right now are some hostas and daylillies (weren't up yet when I took the photo).

That long wood box to the left of the front door is about a foot deep and did hold some tiny bushes...but the overhang of the roof is deep and about 3 feet, so any plants next to the house don't get rainwater and don't last long (I'm not going to remember to water anything there either).  So I haven't known what to do to make it look nicer.

The concrete ""sidewalk"" pad from the driveway to the deck currently slopes down toward the deck...hence water pooled under the deck and rotted the joists which sat right on the ground (plastic underneath it at least.)

I'm getting a quote for a new concrete sidewalk, so that it would slope toward the driveway (there is a channel drain between the sidewalk and the driveway).  Should I just forego a deck and have the sidewalk up against the house all the way to the front door?  Maybe have a concrete stoop that goes a little past the front door...and that's where I could put a couple chairs and small table??  And stack some wood there in the winter??  Should I replace the deck and make it smaller, with a longer sidewalk to meet it??

Maybe drier shade plants near the house to the left of the front door?  We're zone 6b, I think, and that's a pretty shaded area.

I don't have a lot of money to work with, so what are some budget ideas that give my home more curb appeal and also have at least a small place to sit and watch the sunrise?

Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** Isn’t that what we all want as we move closer to retirement? 😌 Let’s get real—navigating Social Security retirement benefits can feel like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. But once you crack the code, you can maximize your income and keep that post-retirement dream alive!

So, what’s the magic number? What’s the best age to start taking those delicious Social Security benefits? Let's break it down!

**The Age Game: What's Your Strategy?**  
You can start taking benefits as early as 62, but hold up! Declaring your love for Social Security too soon might mean leaving *cash on the table*. Here’s a little breakdown:

- **62 years old**:  
  - *Pros*: Get your hands on that sweet cash sooner!  
  - *Cons*: You’re looking at a 25-30% reduction in monthly benefits. Ouch!  

- **Full Retirement Age (FRA)**:  
  - Depending on when you were born, this is between 66 and 67.  
  - *Pros*: You get all the money you’ve earned without penalties! 🎉  
  - *Cons*: You miss out on those early years of benefits.  

- **Delayed Retirement (up to 70)**:  
  - *Pros*: Every year you wait past your FRA adds about 8% to your monthly benefit. That’s a pretty nice return!  
  - *Cons*: You might have to hold off on those vacations to Hawaii a little longer.  

But wait! What about the *realistic goals* part? Setting those goals means weighing your current financial needs against future benefits. Ask yourself:

- Are you healthy enough to wait longer?
- Do you have other income sources?
- How do your retirement plans stack up against waiting for a bigger paycheck?

Sometimes, it’s not just about maximizing — it’s about what fits best for *you*.  

Life doesn’t always follow a script, right? There might be unexpected twists and turns, and maybe you’ll need that extra income sooner than you think. Just remember that your choice today shapes what your tomorrow looks like.

Also, keep an eye on *your satisfaction*. Financial stability can pave the way for a fulfilling retirement, full of travel, hobbies, or just hanging out with the grandkids. Because, let’s be real, who doesn’t want to sip coffee on a sunny porch and reminisce about their glory days? ☕️🌞

So what’s your game plan? Any strategies that worked for you or things you wished you’d known earlier? Let’s hear it!",1,1746671255.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1khfd6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGroupChatWeekly/comments/1khfd6c/the_great_espresso_martini_incident/,The Great Espresso Martini Incident,"You’d think after living in New York for over three years, I’d stop agreeing to be the designated planner when friends visit. But no – I fall for it every time. “We’ll just keep it chill,” they say, which somehow translates to me making a color-coded itinerary and chasing down last-minute dinner reservations like it’s a competitive sport.

This time, two friends from high school were in town. I hadn’t seen them in forever, so I wanted the night to feel special. We started in the West Village – cute dinner, decent cocktails, all was well. Then came the idea to get espresso martinis “somewhere fun.” The kind of vague suggestion that always leads to chaos.

We ended up at this little bar in the East Village that someone found on TikTok. It was packed, hot, and loud. We squeezed into a corner table, immediately ordered three martinis, and tried to pretend we weren’t shouting to hear each other. That’s when things started going south.

One of my friends, trying to squeeze past the tiny table, knocks over *two* of the drinks – one into my lap, one directly onto a stranger’s sleeve. He gave us that look. You know the one. I went into auto-apology mode, trying to blot my pants with a bar napkin while also explaining to this poor guy that we were, in fact, not always like this.

Meanwhile, my other friend is laughing to the point of tears, which only makes it worse. I didn’t know whether to laugh or leave. So I sat there, coffee-soaked, in mild disbelief, trying to decide if I could salvage the night or if we should just call it.

We called it.

Later that night, back in my apartment, I realized how fast a night can unravel in this city – and how being around old friends kind of takes you revert back to your 19-year-old self. You forget how to act normal in public. You forget you’re wearing white pants. You forget that not everything has to be perfect for it to still be a good story.

So yeah, I was a little embarrassed. But honestly? I’d still do it again. Maybe just next time in darker jeans.

With love and mild regret,

Some observations:

This was my 5th trip to the state of Hawaii and my third island (Maui thrice, Kauai and Hawaii). I do not island hop so each island I've visited was its own vacation, not that I have anything against that, I just personally don't do it. 

Hawaii is expensive across the board but the Big Island was the *least* expensive if that's even a thing. Kauai was the most expensive and Maui was closer to Kauai in terms of cost. 

In my opinion, Maui has the best dining options across all tiers (casual dining to fine dining), Kauai was the quietest and the Big Island the most diverse (as in things to see and do). They are all beautiful in their own right however, and I would never tell someone to pick an island based on my opinion. Do your research, ask questions, and then make a decision based on your likes/wants. Where the three islands I've visited are concerned, there is no wrong answer. My island might not be your island, or, the island that vibes with me the most, may not vibe with you at all. This is real.

Having said that, Hawaii is a special place with special people who have managed to maintain their culture and history despite how it all went down. One would do themselves a service by exploring each island and listening to their stories.

I did a million things during my time on the Big Island and while there were a million more left to do, at some point, you call it a trip and thank the universe that you're in a position to fly 4,500 miles to the most magical place, which is exactly what I did.

Up next will be a trip to Oahu. I'm really excited about it but first, I need to pay some bills. lol

Thank you for reading.

PS, I got gas at Costco for $3.85, I saw $4.15 - $4.53 elsewhere throughout the island. 

PPS, I am really bummed I didn't get to Huggo's. That's going to irk me forever. ",3,1746670781.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.67,False
