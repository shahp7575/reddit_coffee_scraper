1o4e6ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1o4e6ts/i_am_researching_how_borrowers_feel_about_debt/,I am researching how borrowers feel about debt repayment rewards-would love your input.,"Hey everyone!

I’m in the same situation as everyone. A lot of my salary goes off to my student loans and has basically made me live paycheck to paycheck. Currently I am working on an idea to **make loan repayment feel rewarding.**  
The concept is simple: you pay your student, auto, or personal loan on time and earn cashback or perks (coffee, groceries, or even a “no-interest month” after 6 months on-time, basically nything that matters to a student.)

Right now I’m just collecting feedback to see **if borrowers would actually want this** before building anything.

If you’ve got a few seconds, could you please fill out this short form? (no email spam, promise - just research and early waitlist):

Here is the link of the form. 

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe15zKqOmYqVBqSlVjIVdMLfaI\_esFj3tmoZnUAmhe5xRc9bQ/viewform?usp=header](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe15zKqOmYqVBqSlVjIVdMLfaI_esFj3tmoZnUAmhe5xRc9bQ/viewform?usp=header)

I’d also love to hear in the comments if I might be missing out on something in my questions:

* Would rewards actually motivate you to make extra or on-time payments?
* What types of rewards would feel meaningful to you?

Thanks a ton. I’ll share insights later in this post as a reply if people are curious.

1o4e4ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeIndia/comments/1o4e4ne/29m_hyderabad/,"29M, Hyderabad","I’m 29, from Hyderabad.
Life didn’t go in a straight line for me. I dropped out of college years ago, worked, learned along the way, and recently completed my degree. The last few months were dramatic but in a good way. I finally feel like I’m restarting everything… career, priorities, and the way I see life.

I’m the kind of person who mixes logic with emotion. I overthink a lot, even small things like spreadsheets.
I really hate when anger or impulse take over on anyone. My brain’s curious and gets distracted, but I love learning new things.

I eat mostly vegetarian, don’t drink anything (not even tea or coffee).

I like kids but I’ve chosen to stay childfree. Parenting feels like a huge emotional, financia. I’d rather live simply, travel, stay close to nature, temples and not follow every “default” milestone.

Long term, I want to work towards FIRE (financial independence, retire early). My income isn’t huge right now, but I’m focused and patient.
One of my dreams after retirement is to start a small farm and live surrounded by trees, away from the city. That thought really keeps me going. Love traveling to place with lot of trees. 

Long part for nerds - 
I still need time to grow financially. The way I was brought up made me believe that to have people around me, I needed to look a certain way, earn well, or have some special skill. My family is loving and kind, but for some reason it has always been hard for me to see or feel them that way. Over time, I slowly pulled away from everyone and never really built strong friendships either. I realised having people around you is fun if you are don't have to act.

Earlier I thought I could only post once I have stable 60k+ income, but real connections don’t happen instantly. For someone like me, both financial stability and emotional trust take time.

I don’t know if this is right or wrong, but I feel having a partner makes life better in many ways. By a good partner, I mean someone who sees the other person the same way they see themselves. The same likeness, respect, freedom, and sense of self. Most people have barriers when they talk to others. They worry about what the other person will think or whether something will be accepted. But they rarely put those same thoughts on themselves. Am extreme example - If someone want to commit Adultery, they run those thoughts freely in their brain right,now imagine that someone could talk about this with their partner. I don't mean to commit adultery, but this is the level of freedom a couple should have to stay happy in a relationship. It’s like having an “extra me” in life.

Humans are born with only two fears. Almost all other fears and likes are learned from the way we grow up. When you like someone, you bend your world a little towards them. When someone wants you, they bend theirs too. I feel this is what makes the difference between couples who stay happy and those who grow apart. It’s not a formula, just a kind of magic that only works when both people trust each other deeply.

I’m looking for someone who’s also childfree, emotionally balanced, has a sense of humour, and prefers peace over drama. Yelling or anger really affects me, and I don’t want that in my life anymore. I take time to trust because of my past, but I’m genuine and loyal. I want to build something real, start with friendship, and see where it goes.",1,1760237637.0,ChildfreeIndia,1,1.0,False

1o4e3bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/1o4e3bz/looking_for_coffee_shop_w_homemade_syrups/,Looking for coffee shop w homemade syrups,"Hello! I went to Southern Hills Farms and got their Pumpkin Caramel Latte at their little market that sells candles/jams and it was amazing.

I only got it because they said they get the sauce/syrups from a local Orlando coffee shop that makes it in house. The flavor of the syrup/sauce was AMAZING! 

I’m wondering if anyone knows which coffee shop they get it from? I asked one of the workers as I was leaving and he said “it should be Sysco Torani unless they changed it”. I am not fond of Torani so I know that was not Sysco … also I’m not sure why the workers would lie to me about it being locally sourced.

ive (21f) been single since birth. ive never had anything beyond a situationship. most of the time i dont think im ugly (not physically or personality-wise) but i dont feel lovable. i have a few close friends, and im a friendly person, so i know a lot of people from my university. i don’t think im hard to talk to, but i feel like people just dont see me as a potential partner. it seems like everyone sees me only as a really good friend, at best.

its important to say that i really enjoy staying at home. i like watching movies and youtube, drinking coffee, reading manga or books, and writing (a hobby of mine). i like spending time alone, so thats what i usually do. i dont enjoy drinking or partying, or using drugs like most people my age, and because of that ive always felt like i dont have a very active social life, but it never really bothered me much.

recently, my best friend (20f) started dating a guy she just met. after a month of dating, she asked me if i thought it was too soon for her to feel like she loves him. i told her the truth; that maybe it was a little fast, but it was fine as long as he felt the same way, she just needed to not rush anything and get to know him better. i also say (kinda as a joke) that my advice might not be the best since ive never dated anyone. she said that i would never date anyone if i didnt go out more.

at first i didnt think much about it, but later i started feeling really sad because i realized she might be right. even if she dindt say it with a bad intention (i lean on think that she say it as an advice), it stuck with me since then. i dont really put myself out there. im not very social (im more of an introvert who gets socially drained just from going to class) and im also really awkward when it comes to flirting. im shy and never know what to do. in high school, i always thought dating wouldn’t be a problem in the future, that id eventually be with someone. but that never happened, and maybe thats my fault.

to clarify, im not writing this as a “nice guy” kind of post, it is not a “im nice, so people are bad for not wanting me.” thats not it. im not blaming anyone else; im blaming myself. i feel like because i wasnt interested in dating back in high school, i missed the chance to learn and experience relationships. and now that i \*am\* interested, i just dont know how or where to start one. i dont know how to flirt, how to show interest, or how to recognize when someone might like me. i just dont know how any of this works, and it makes me feel ashamed, especially when my friends talk about their partners or exes, and i have nothing to add.

i know im young, and im not expecting to meet the love of my life right now. but i cant think of a single time when someone liked me and i liked them back. not even once. im afraid that maybe im just not the kind of person people find attractive in a romantic way. it makes me sad because i really want to feel loved, and to love someone too. i dont think im a bad, stupid, or ugly person. i dont even think i'd be boring to date. i just feel like i might be responsible for my lack of romantic experiences; because i wasnt interested before, maybe i unknowingly took away my own chances to love and be loved for ever. i dont know what im doing wrong, if its something in my personality or if i just dont have experience in it, but i dont feel like anyone has ever loved me in that sense and it just destroys my self-esteem. it makes me believe that im not made for being love romanticlly and thats why no one has been interested in dating me.

im sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of post. im just venting here because i feel ashamed for having these thoughts and feelings, and i dont really know where or with whom to share them. i havent really been able to talk this through with anyone. my therapist knows its a problem, but we havent really discussed it with her yet (every time we bring this topic up, i cry so hard that i cant even talk. so its kind of stuck for now. i also cry writing this). i mentioned it to a friend once, and she said she wanted to take me to a gay bar to ""try to hook up with someone,"" but i declined because i really dont think this is something i can solve that way, i have kissed people and even had sex before, its not that im completely inexperienced but this issue is more about the romantic aspect.

It was great of course at first, na eenjoy nya and I can really see it however he had sudden breakdown na lang last week. He said hindi niya raw alam kung bakit bigla na lang siyang umiyak, bumisita ako sa kanya that night and dinalahan sya ng foods, naluluha na raw siya nung makita ako pero pinigilan lang niya. It was brief lang kasi marami silang costumers that time. Tapos kagabi lang masyado niya atang dinamdam yung sermon sa kanila ng boss nya. He was asked paano gawin yung isang menu then na mental block sya pero alam nya naman daw paano. I said na sermon is a normal part sa work and that valid naman yung naramdaman niya since di pa naman siya masyadong matagal dun.

[Breville Bambino]","I'm pretty new to the at home-barista business after being a barista at a pretty mediocre coffee chain. I know watery espresso is a common issue, but none of the guides I was reading were mentioning a puddle of water on top of grounds in the portafilter.

I'm now the proud owner of a Bambino, but my setup is currently incomplete when it comes to an actual grinder which I think is my issue - wanted to get some advice so I didn't go trying to fix the wrong issue, lol. When I pulled my first shots, they came out incredibly watery and when I pulled the portafilter off, there was a little puddle of water on top of the grounds that didn't quite get through. I did commit a major sin by grabbing the finest ground beans I could off the shelf on my way home from work, which is why I'm leaning towards the grind being the issue, but I was also curious if maybe tamping too hard could have anything to do with it because I also think I went pretty heavy handed lol.

There's a local spot where they do all of their coffee roasting and grinding in house + you can buy actually ground beans specifically for espresso by the bag, so I'm planning on hitting them up tomorrow regardless while I peruse for a good compact grinder. To those much more experienced than I, does this sound like a grind specific problem or should I relax a little when it comes to my tamping?

	•	The video (or short series) was titled “The Blah Witch”.
	•	Each segment began with a parody disclaimer shown on a computer screen before the footage started (something like “This is a parody” or similar legal-style text).
	•	It was a low-budget, early-internet parody of The Blair Witch Project — not a TV sketch or DVD anthology. I likely saw it around 1999–2002, possibly through iFilm, AtomFilms, eBaum’s World, CollegeHumor, AlbinoBlacksheep, or a personal webpage.
	•	The main character was a guy in a wig imitating Heather Donahue from the original film.
	•	He does a fake crying scene, visibly squeezing eye drops into his eyes to simulate tears.
	•	The “stick figures” hanging in the forest were popsicle sticks with coffee cup lids for heads.
	•	There’s a moment where he says something like “I wish I could find my car”, and the camera pans to reveal the car is literally down the hill behind him.
	•	Instead of a tent scene, there’s a bathtub scene — he’s in a tub with the shower curtain closed, parodying the Blair Witch tension.
	•	It ends with the crew entering a fancy house, where the tone changes into a real estate–style house tour, describing features like “open floor plan” and “great lighting.”

❌ What It’s Not
	•	Not The Bogus Witch Project (Pauly Shore anthology, 2000)
	•	Not The Scooby-Doo Project
	•	Not Scary Movie, MADtv, or Da Hip Hop Witch
	•	Definitely looked independent or web-made, possibly by a small comedy group or film students.

🔍 Why It Matters

This parody circulated briefly online in the early web-video era, right when sites like iFilm and AtomFilms hosted amateur shorts before YouTube existed. Many of those files are now missing due to domain shutdowns or lost archives. Identifying The Blah Witch could help recover an early example of web-native comedy parodying found-footage horror.

🙏 What I’m Looking For
	•	Any links, mirrors, or archive captures of The Blah Witch
	•	Credits for the creator(s) or sketch group
	•	Screenshots, file names, or downloads from old computers
	•	Mentions in early film festival listings, message boards, or “funny video” compilations from ~1999–2002

1o4dfn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1o4dfn5/juba_and_the_vampires/,Juba and the Vampires,"Moving with a rhythmic strut Zella Landers moved along the walk under the dim streetlamps. Her worn jeans were torn in the kneecaps, running shoes also showed wear. Also adorning her diminutive frame was a white turtleneck and a brown leather jacket.

   Her brown eyes were focused on the path before her. Sadness was in her heart. Distraction came when a hand clasped her butt.

   “You best let go of that.” She spun to deck him, the grinning man dodged her blow and stumbled back smirking. “Ella, nice to see you again, pretty face.”

“Leave me alone, I got things to do.”

   He was slender, dark red hair, stood in the dark. “Not this again. You’re headed to that club? They’ll never let you in.”

   She shrugged her shoulders. It wasn’t any of his business. “Just leave me alone.”

   “Come on babe, let’s have some party.” He reached to grab her again. A leer on his face.

   She brushed his hand away. He was becoming more aggressive moving in on her. Bristling, she started to kick at him.

   The young man laughed. “Ella, you don’t know how to fight. I can teach you though.”

   He crumpled as she put her foot in his midsection. “Hmm.” Ella sounded, turned, and started away.

   The club from the outside looked like a place. From inside she could hear the music when the doors opened. She edged near as she could, a side of the building. From there she watched folks in fine dress go in and out. Even the lot was clean.

   Was father still at the bar? Mom was probably at her dealer’s house. Here, watching this scene, listening, it was like experiencing a fantasy. A life she’d never have.

   Occasionally the doorman sent a glance her way. But he never said anything.

   Then a limousine pulled to the front and a group of five exited. A smirk was on Zella’s face. She spotted the well-dressed woman in sequined red dress. A curvy ample-chested dark-haired woman with pale skin.

 “What are you guys? Vampires?” She chuckled.

   The woman’s deep dark eyes turned tom her. “Are you a street urchin?”

   The young woman snorted. All these people had strange looks and wicked vibes. Despite her nerves Zella maintained a smirk. Her hands in her jacket pockets she started away. The mystery woman’s eyes on her.

   Suddenly she was in front of Zella. “Would you care to join us?” Her fingers touched the young woman’s cheek.

   Falling back Zella’s mouth formed a circle. “They wouldn’t let me in there, and I doubt I’d fit in with your crew anyway.”

   The red lipped smile on the woman’s face was unnerving, still Zella held her composure. “My name is Veronica.”

   “I’m Zella.”

   Veronica spun her around. “You will get in with us.”

   Fear consumed her, Zella bolted and ran. Her chest pounded as her feet grabbed her. Then she was yanked off her feet and tossed into an alley colliding with some trash cans.

   Veronica stared at her. Then grabbed her by the throat, jerked her up and slammed her against the wall. She then sunk her sharp teeth into the woman’s throat. Strangely it didn’t hurt much more than two needle pricks.

   “Now my blood is in you. I control you; I can track you anywhere you try and go. What I’ve done wont change you, but now I own you,” Veronica said. “Do not try and escape me again.”

   Zella knew she wouldn’t as her arm was twisted behind her back, and she was forced along.

   “I shall give you a new name,” Veronica said. “You shall be called Juba.”

   “Good,” called a handsome man with perfect combed yellow hair and a handsome face and build in a three-piece suit.

   “Thank you, Stefan.”

Inside the club, bright and colorful lights shone. Juba followed her mistress to a table, where she joined another figure. Another well-dressed man, green eyes. “Veronica, who is your new friend?”

   “This is my servant Juba.” She smiled. Pointed to a chair and the young woman sat. “How are you, Zamon?”

   “Fine.”

   “How are things with the Unseelie?”

   He shook his head. “Unorganized, forever arguing. The only thing they agree on is wanting to destroy all those born half-human and half-fae.”

   “Seems a waste.”

   “I agree.” He smiled. “A new tYRANUS is rising, taking power. I think he will soon dominate the Unseelie Court, and then all others, drawing them under his domain.”

   “TYRANUS?” Veronica shook her head. “Strange title.”

Zamon just shrugged his shoulders. “I am headed for a place with the unfortunate name of monkey’s Knee. It seems  a royal member of the Seelie Court is in that area. The TYRANUS wants me to find out why.”

   “Oh? What does it matter?”

   “Why there of all places?” Zamon said. “He likes to keep tabs on them as well as others.”

   “I see. Good luck.” Veronica said.

   A server brought her a goblet of red wine. The woman wore a black sequined dress. Anything for your pet?”

   Juba cringed.

   “Give her some wine as well, dear.” As the server strode away she looked to the young woman. “You will find there are advantages to being with me.”

Juba smiled, nervous. “So, us average humans?”

“We shall find ways for you to fit in,” Zamon said.

   “Don’t worry my pet,” Veronica said softly.

   Juba looked to her. “Why did you – take me?”

   “You drew my attention, you talked tom us, asked a question.” Veronica smiled. “You know Zamon, we may just be able to use this one to help get the information you wish.”

   “Perhaps,” he said.

   Her nerves shook as both looked at her.

 

 

Things had not been so bad as she’d expected since Veronica took her. Wearing a white dress and black apron Juba prepared her mistress’ breakfast.

   It had been surprising to learn the mistress, master, whatever, ate regular food and could sleep average hours. Was she a vampire or something else? Of course she’d said she was something worse.

   Veronica was out on the patio watching the dawn rise.

   “Your breakfast ma’am,” Juba said as she carried the tray out. The steaming coffee did smell tempting.

   “Thank you. Have you eaten yet?”

   “Not yet.”

   “Get yourself something and join me.” The mistress sat in a lounge chair. She pointed to a blanket on the cement floor for Juba to sit.

   “Yes, thank you.” Juba went to obey. She thought of her old days when she was just Zella, a street urchin no one cared for.

   Now, a nice house, a job with perks, a decent employer. Still would there be a darker payment attached for all this good fortune. Well, good enough.

While in the kitchen the doorbell rang and she went to answer. The stranger appeared as a little old man in jeans, a black, red and white stripped shirts, boots and a red color cap. “I’m here to see your owner,” his voice was raspy and broken by coughs.

   “Miss Veronica is on the patio.” Juba told him. “Can I get you anything?”

   “Coffee,” He said and plodded to the patio.

   Juba soon brought him his coffee. “Miss Veronica, shall I dine inside as you have company?”

  “No, come, join us.”

   From the sour look in the man’s eyes Juba wasn’t sure he liked the idea. Maybe he just didn’t like humans.

Juba settled on the blue beach blanket with her food and coffee.

   “I see you have gotten yourself a pet,” Red cap said.

   Inside Juba bristled. Servant maybe, but pet?

   “Her name is Juba,” Veronica said. “Now what can I do for you Mr. Snort?”

   His name was Snort? Juba wanted to smile in amusement at that but checked herself.

   “The unseelie Court has certain concerns about our mutual friend, Zamon the Deamon Fae. They feel he may be working to undermine us.”

   “Well, it has bene somewhile since I last saw Zamon.” She said. “We talked mostly of trivial things”

   “M-mm.” He sounded. “There is a dark power rising, one who calls himself a tYRANUS lord. He uses both magic and cyber stuff I certainly don’t understand. But this cyber stuff is human, and should not be used by such as us.”

   “But if he is not one of you?”

“If he is a dark one he still falls under the Unseelie, and needs follow our rules.” Mr. Snort said. “Zamon has been assigned to keep tabs on an Seelie high-five who for some reason is in the area. We suspect there are half-fae and half-humans. We would round them up and burn them.”

   Looking at him, Juba’s thoughts turned to old stories of ancient fae beings. “Red cap.” She whispered.

   Both looked at her. “Something to say darling?” Veronica asked.

   “Yes I am a red cap. No we no longer redden our caps with human blood.” He chuckled. “Much easier just to buy red caps.” He paused. Grinned. “Doesn’t mean we don’t still enjoy a good human roasting.”

   “I will certainly keep my eye on Zamon if that is what the Unseelie wish.” Veroncia said.

   “It is,” Mr. Snort said and rose. “It seems there are things more evil than us in the world now.” He started away. “Good day, Miss Veronica.”

After the creature was gone, Juba looked to her mistress. “Ma’am, may I ask a question?”

   “Of course my dear.”

   “Are you a  vampire? I’d never thought such ate regular food, and only prowled at night.”

   She laughed. “Those are just stories. I am a Blood Master level vampire, highest rank of order. And I have magic, a rare thing among us.”

“Wow.” Juba sounded.

   Smiling, Veronica chuckled. “Glad you’re impressed.” She sipped some coffee. “The Unseelie Court is always in chaos, they need replaced by a more organized body.”

“You are on Zamon’s side?”

   “Yes.”

   “What if they find out you are working against them?”

   “Not much. Maybe send an assassin, who will fail and die.” She shook her head and sipped some more coffee. Her eyes were on Juba. “I sense you are becoming most loyal to me. Very good. It will be the right side for you.”

   Juba took the dishes back to the kitchen to clean. Whistling she started cleaning. Did her family or friends even notice she was gone? Did she really care if they did?

“Thinking about, family, friends?” Veronica stood in the doorway.”

   “Yes.” She turned to her. “I can’t say that I miss them though.”

   “We will be going to Monkey’s Knee. I want you to blend into the society learn about it and the people.”

   Juba’s eyes widened. “Me? A spy?” Exciting and scary.

   “I guess you could call it that. You can do it, you would be harder to detect, especially now that my blood is in you.” Veronica said. “You would not even be suspected since you are a human. Other supernats tend to underestimate your kind.”

Her heart swelled. Juda was proud the woman had such faith in her. “Have you always been – what you are?”

Veronica took a drink. “No. I was turned into what I am by a powerful sorcerer.” They are the highest rung of the magic users.

“Wow.”

   The woman smiled. “Now, we have to find a way to get you into their society. I suppose it shouldn’t be too hard.”

1o4dezz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1o4dezz/if_society_continues_to_act_silly_when_it_comes/,If society continues to act silly when it comes to gender dynamics between men and women. Then online dating apps should be the only valid place to form relationships.,"No, it’s not the workplace, or a hobby. I don't care if you meet your husband at a gym or your husband cat-calling you was the way he won you. I don’t care how toxic dating apps are, or how “deep” and “authentic” meeting in real life is supposed to be. Dating is still the only environment where intentions are clear. There’s less room for plausible deniability, misinterpretation, or the usual “you’re creepy for trying” nonsense. For example, no muddying the waters advice to men telling them to attract women without trying to attract women. Or people saying it's creepy for men to join hobbies with the solo purpose of getting a girlfriend. Everyone involved knows why they’re there, sexually or romantically or otherwise, without hidden agendas.

Because outside of dating, men are constantly told mixed messages. If they approach women at work, they’re “unprofessional.” If they do it in public or the gym,  they’re “creepy.” If they join a hobby group, they’re “infiltrating spaces for women.” It’s the same shaming cycle,.

The entire online culture that tells men, “Don’t talk to women here, don’t ask there, don’t express interest.” But here’s the catch,  women rarely do invite. That’s not how attraction usually works. So men are being told to both initiate and never initiate at the same time.

The irony is, people claim they want organic connections. “Meet someone through your hobbies,” they say. But again the moment a man actually does that, the narrative flips, “Oh, so you joined just to hit on women?” As if any man interested in a woman must automatically be predatory. It’s a double standard that turns normal human attraction into a social crime.

That’s why dating, flawed as it is, remains the most honest environment left. You match, you talk, you decide. There’s no “is she into me??” or “is she being friendly ?” The parameters are upfront. You’re allowed to be attracted. You’re allowed to express it.

The problem with relying on “real-world” connection advice BS, is that it sets men up for failure. It tells them to read minds, to rely on “vibes,” to magically know when interest is mutual without ever asking. But when men do ask, they’re scolded for being direct. When they don’t, they’re called passive or cowardly.

Online daters may complain about ghosting, swiping fatigue, and shallow encounters. But at least there’s structure. Everyone knows the game. There’s no moral posturing about where or how you met. It’s two adults making an informed choice. That’s a lot more straightforward than the constant social landmines elsewhere.

So no,  it’s not the workplace, or the gym, or your friend’s art class. Dating is the only fair, transparent system left. If society keeps punishing men for showing interest anywhere else, then dating is the only place where both sides can actually admit what they’re there for, without fear, confusion, or accusation.

And again honestly, I don’t care how many people cry about how “soulless” dating apps are. Spare me the “real connections happen organically” nonsense. The same people saying that are the first to shame a guy for showing romantic interest in real life. You can’t have it both ways. You either accept dating apps, the one environment built for this, or you admit you just don’t want men approaching women at all.

Every other so-called “natural” setting is now a minefield. Work? HR nightmare. Gym? Creepy. Coffee shop? Harassment. Park? Weird. Hobbies? Manipulative. What’s left? Exactly, nothing. That’s why dating apps exist, because society keeps punishing men for trying anywhere else. If you don’t like dating apps, then stop demonizing men who make an effort offline. Until then, don’t complain.

I’m not going to sit here and pretend that men should learn to “read the room” better or “develop social intuition.” That’s just code for “guess what women are thinking without ever asking.” No thanks. I’ll take the app where both people swiped right, both people know what’s up, and nobody has to decode unspoken signals like it’s a hostage negotiation.

At the end of the day, I’ll pick clarity over chaos. I don’t care how romanticized “organic connections” sound when everyone’s just waiting to call someone creepy. Dating apps might not be perfect, but at least they’re honest. And that’s more than I can say for the fake, judgmental “advice” culture that tells men to just “let things happen naturally” while punishing them every time they try.

Im like literally obsessed with watching these reddit relationship posts on TikTok but I never thought I'd be posting one 😭 but im in a bad spot and I need advice y'all 😩 I think I've made my bf insecure about his height and I feel so bad 😭

ok so I matched with my bf on tinder this summer and he's so sweet. like literally the sweetest guy I've ever dated. like he's the only guy I know who isn't embarrassed to say he's a feminist and when I told him im into sports he was just excited to talk to me about it instead of quizzing me on random ass facts like so many guys do. if ur a girl into guy things then yk.

so a couple months ago we had dinner w my friends + their bfs. but I had such an awful day and I was in such an awful mood bcuz I was pmsing (maybe tmi?? 🫣 lol idk) and I had like 3 very rude customers during my shift so I went to the dinner just bitchy af. I was also kinda stressing over this dinner cuz all he was meeting my entire friend group for the 1st time. also me and my friends used to make fun of short dudes (sorry to all the short kings reading. ik better now.) so I was extra stressed that maybe one of my friends would say smth stupid during dinner but my bf was super cool with everyone and everyone liked him. its just when all the guys got together to take a group pic and he looked so short it just ruined my mood even more (ik it was stupid af 😭 pls dont hate on me). I didn't want to feel that way but I think I was just looking at things to get annoyed at that night and then when we were at my place after dinner, my bf asked me why my mood was off so I said him being so much shorter than the other guys pmo (on my life I regretted it the second I said it).

it took a week of apologizing but we’re still together now but like it lowkey hasn’t been the same since. even though i’ve apologized like a million times, told him i don’t care about his height anymore, but he still gets insecure randomly. the most recent one is what made me write this post bcuz it breaks my heart each time.

now since we became exclusive, every Friday he comes to where I work bcuz my shift and his classes end at the same time and his campus is nearby and then we go to either of our places to hang out. yesterday ig his last class got canceled so she showed up an hour early and it was rlly cute cuz he came up to me and acted like he didn't know me but flirted with me while he ordered his coffee and it made my day. anyway, he just sat and drank his coffee while I worked and me and this guy always work the same shifts so we're friendly with each other. so while we worked, my coworker made a couple of jokes and made me laugh but I wasn't touchy or anything. just friendly. I think my bf must've been triggered by that bcuz he asked me that evening if I find the coworker more attractive since he's tall and like hello???? ofc I dont 😫 I think my bf is the most handsome dude everrrr but he finds it hard to believe that at times and I'm like how do I fix this??? cuz I dont want him feeling insecure over his height anymore. I literally DONT CARE and knowing that he thinks I find other guys hotter just bcuz they're taller breaks my heart. I spent all of today crying bcuz its all my fault and he's so sweet that he shouldn't be feeling this way 🥺 and he isn't even SHORT. he's like 5'8ish and i think our height difference is super cute. (i'm 5'6) i dont even wear heels anymore just in case it might make him feel bad.

i just want him to believe me when i say i think he’s hot + i’m super attracted to him. i feel like i ruined it by being shallow that one night and now he can’t un-hear it. i genuinely don’t see him as “short” anymore, i just see him as MY bf, but idk how to actually get him to believe that.

how do i fix this??

tl;dr - I said and did a couple of things which might've made my bf insecure of his height even though I don't care about it. how can I make him feel secure with me?",1,1760234943.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Where had he seen her before? Leroux began to drum up typical scenes of social coincidence; the Gardens Milieu, or the markets in the Commercial Marche. Her face fit every background put to it. It remained an important clue, of that he was sure. Anything else dissolved into uncertainty.

The gramophone spun its record. What played he surmised were the cheerful lamentations of a spurned lover. The clock beside it flashed number after number, newfangled and electronic. Leroux scratched his head, the effort frustrated by a thin layer of cotton wrappings. Little had yet emerged from the smoke, but he was told that habit retention was good. Reading some old journals, listening to music, and speaking with people he knew might also help, apparently. Moreso, it might return progress to his most recent case.

One of the journals sat before him now. Fine leather lay marred with cracks, charred black in places. Its yellowed pages were similarly tattered and singed. On them, compact, organized penmanship chronicled a young detective, blindly in love with a charming girl. Some fragments were missing, of course. He gathered the impression of unreciprocated adulation, from a florid and presumptuous poet. Judging by the pages and pages of saccharine fluff, at least. An uncharacteristic leap from the reserved professional that dwelled just one volume previous, thought Leroux. The contents shifted from casework to praises of his love. But whoever this girl was—the author said little of substance—she clearly brought him trouble; the final entries were illegibly burnt, the back cover missing. On the last page, portions of a face, eaten away by the flames, smiled back at him. The face of this girl, he knew, one irascibly familiar. He had seen it before, rendered in flesh instead of paper and ink. But where, dammit?

Leroux leaned back in his chair, stifling a groan. Another headache bubbled up, more frequent than before. Such contemplation was ill-advised while in recovery, but he knew the case was urgent. These journals were pulled from an arson, alongside their half-dead scribe, the only witnesses twenty-three tenants. The man reached for his coffee, grown cold, and took note of the clock. Hours had passed in a blink, without result. Dinner would be served in the cafeteria soon; he had missed lunch by a fair few hours.

Distracted, his hand bumped into the paper cup. Its contents issued across his statements. Cursing, he belatedly rescued them, then froze. Twenty-three statements for twenty-three tenants. But the building housed twenty-four tenants, didn’t it?

Each statement bore a name. He combed through the final journal, searching desperately for the missing name. Leroux cursed the damnable fool who wrote it. A whole journal about the girl, and not one utterance of her legal name?

While Leroux found no names, he did stumble across a passage he’d earlier overlooked. On the penultimate page, it was brief:

*Oh, what a rapturous day! Twin successes draw near, of profession and person! At last the angel of my solitude has taken a turn, and promised herself to me, if only for an evening. She has taken a keen interest in my most recent case, as such a fine amateur sleuth ought to. We will discuss the work of dissecting Parossia’s underbelly over tea tonight. A morbid dialogue, I’m sure, but is it not the duty of the teacher to encourage such intense curiosity?*

A knock at the door disrupted his revelation. Night had fallen on the ward; Leroux had missed dinner as well. The late hour felt unremarkable; spontaneity thus far defined his treatment in hospital.

He did not call to enter, focus instead on recollecting his thoughts. The door creaked open, but no greeting came. He turned to amend the silence, finding the door only cracked. Somebody peered from the gloom on the other side, made out by lamplight from his desk. They wore a nurse’s smock, eyes wide, stare empty and fixed firmly on Leroux.

The detective froze. He recognized that face. Memories crashed back into his mind, flashing, one after another. Those same gray eyes, soft cheekbones and fulsome bronze locks. At the coffee shop, the train station, the park and the markets. In his flat, in the office, in the light of rising flames. In what he believed were his last moments.

They beheld each other, gazes locked. The electric clock ticked over.

The girl in the twelfth flat swung wide the door. Leroux’s lamp flickered out.

1o4d7h1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4d7h1,Website/app/weekly ad not matching? Do sales end earlier than end of day/week?,"I never shopped at Shoprite before, but I saw a great deal on California olive oil earlier this week so I made an account. 

Now, I go into the app and the sale price is gone. Several hours before store close. It's like that for a lot of my shopping list sale items and I'm confused because there are a bunch of discrepancies:
(I checked the sale dates, exact item, store location, app and web location, digital weekly ad store location, etc.)

- OVOO was weird because the website item page said it's on sale for the week of 5th (ending today), but it wasn't in the weekly ad. Only searchable on the site (don't know about app because I hadn't downloaded it yet). Same thing for canned corn 4/$1 - not in the weekly ad, when I search on website the item showed up with sale price ending this week, now showing regular price. 
I took a screenshot of Google with its price tracking past several days that matches the price I saw in the website. [photo 6]

- Then there are sale items that ARE in the weekly ad, that doesn't show up as on sale anymore on either website or the app. For example-
Store baked pumpkin pie was $5 on the ad and on the website as of yesterday when I last checked - now back to its original price on both app and web. 
Same thing for Haagen dazs cups, which clearly shows in the screenshot the sale is until today. [Photos 1-4]

- But there are items on the weekly ad that does still show its sale price or deals correctly on app/web. This is what makes the whole thing confusing, because if everything went off sale prices I'd just assume the app/web renews the weekly prices earlier in the day. That's clearly not the case though. 

- And then I noticed a huge chunk of the departments are just missing in ""All Sale Items"" category. No frozen, seafood, produce... I'm guessing all those products are gone from sale. [Photo 5]


Are these missing/off sale items out of stock or sold out? (Which sounds doubtful and also I'd argue they should still show the sale prices but just marked out of stock...) 
Does digital change its weekly prices before the end of store hours at the end of the sale week, in the middle of the day? 
Am I going to get ad prices honored if I go in the evening, or do I have go before 5pm or something? 
Are the app/web not in sync?

1o4d71l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4d71l,First 10K race at Nike Melbourne Marathon (with Coach Bennett as audio guide),"I started Running 1.5 years ago... a 8.52 KM pace 5K.

Went through the NRC Get Started, 5K program, 10K program (twice), I hit my conservative 10K KM pace ( under 7:30 min) 10 days before Melbourne Marathon 10K race.

Went to the runner village an hour early, bag drop, coffee, lined up for toilet... etc.

Got my watch ready, Tidal and NRC app ready.

Coach Bennet said start slow, and I did, with a slower song on my playlist to start too. 1st KM. I looked at my watch and found that my HR is already over 170 so I backed off a bit.

Everything is a blur and chaotic.
It is VERY packed. I had to zig zag to take over.

I started worried about my HR (190ish) but my breathing was okay so I kept going. 

At the 9th KM, I felt like I am pushing myself too hard and my HR over 200. I saw some guy with the ""under 1 hour"" bib went horizontal and got taken care of by the first aids and took it as a sign and even walked a bit.

The guided run ended 800m early and I kept going strong, and started sprinting (and zig zag through other runners) to the finished line.

I am very happy that I did a 68mins 10K (6m48s /km) and I didn't really struggle.

The heart rate is a bit concerning though (apparently my MAX HR was 207), especially I am 47. I'll talk to my doctor about it.

For some reasons  the run wasn't t saved on the NRC app (big fingers?) so I just screen cap the polar app and Nike Melbourne Marathon website.

I love her more than anything and she does too. I’ve been to her house twice now in the past month. Her parents are super super fucking strict. Definitely the most strict people I’ve ever met in my life. I can only be over for a little over an hour, doors must be open, they must be home. That’s not even the worse part. They’re the worse to my gf. They scapegoat the shit out of her every single day about the smallest thing. She’s grounded right now because they found her drinking coffee in her room. Guess she’s not supposed to have any food in there. They also think grades determine her life even though she’s clearly said to them that she’s going to a trade school. She told me not too long ago that her dad was yelling at her again and is punishing her. She hasn’t responded in a while so she probably got her phone taken away. They’ve made her into the third parent. Last summer she said she was grounded the entire time during summer break. No phone, no hanging out with friends, no communication with the outside world for 3 months.
And when I was over, her mom was just about the nicest human being I had ever met in my life. She most likely puts on a mask around me. Her dad ain’t. He didn’t even say hi to me when I was over the second time. Just walked past. 

I need to have a conversation with them about her. How they’re not treating her right. That she needs to be listened to and shouldn’t be punished for every little thing she does. She’s suicidal and if I don’t act quickly upon this I might lose her. She’s tried taking her life before many times before I met her. 

Just what do I say to them?
“I just wanna have a talk about your daughter. She’s told me she’s getting yelled at all the time about every little mistake she does. And I worry about her. I hate having to hear her talking about how one of you yelled at her about how her grades aren’t on point or how she forgot to do her chores or why she’s not working on homework. I love her. I wanna hear good things from her. Of course I wanna hear about the downs but I also wanna hear about the ups. I understand you care for her, it’s just that it seems like her mental health isn’t the best. She’s going through a lot right now with school and relationships with her friends. Coming home and being yelled at on top of that would put her to her breaking point. Just instead of yelling at her and punishing her about her wrongdoings. Maybe try to sit and have a calm talk with her about the problem. Yelling at her and threatening her with punishments are not gonna help her learn. I worry for her.”

the breaking point came when i realized i couldn't remember the last time i woke up feeling good. like genuinely energized and ready for the day. it had been months, maybe years. i was starting every morning by flooding my brain with other people's problems, news, drama, and comparison.

decided to try something extreme. put my phone charger in the bathroom instead of next to my bed. couldn't check it until after i brushed my teeth and washed my face. that's it. no willpower test every morning, just physically harder to grab. first day was brutal. hand automatically reached for the nightstand. nothing there. felt weird. anxious even. but i got up, did my bathroom routine, and by then the urge had passed.

managed 4 days. then a week. then it just became normal. now it's been 8 months. what actually changed: i started doing things in the morning. like actual things. made coffee slowly instead of rushing. read physical books. went for walks. had real conversations with my partner instead of both of us staring at screens. but here's the weirdest part - when i don't start my day with my phone, i barely want it during the day either. it's like that first scroll session was programming my brain to crave it all day long. break that cycle and suddenly i'm not constantly reaching for it.

my screen time went from 7-8 hours daily to around 2-3 hours. and most of that now is actually useful stuff like maps, music, or texting people i care about. not mindless consumption.

the morning sets the template. if you start reactive and distracted, you stay reactive and distracted. if you start intentional and present, the rest follows. if you're stuck in the morning scroll trap, just try moving your charger across the room for 3 days. that's it. don't try to quit your phone entirely or become some productivity robot. just make it slightly harder to grab first thing. you'll be shocked at how different your days feel.",8,1760234388.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

1o4cwsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o4cwsj/eternal_lease/,Eternal Lease,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated.

No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again.

With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, I made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting.

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak.

I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done.

I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be.

I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.”

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made.

But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself.

The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything.

As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes.

Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.

Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will.

I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from inside the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out.

“Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?”

“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.”

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was made for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian.

However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip.

He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.”

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face.

“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.”

“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it.

“Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”

His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.

“Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done anything that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?”

The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right.

“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily.

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”

“I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.

“Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”

B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder

B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love.

I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.”

I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.”

Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.”

He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?”

It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this.

“Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.”

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes.

As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest.

B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”

I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to hear.

At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face.

“Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.”

After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.”

My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.

The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up.

I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted.

I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”

As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day.

He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?”

“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.”

“Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head.

“Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly.

As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.

I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house.

There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong.

“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear.

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately.

I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. “Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter.

My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s and a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked.

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad.

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since when do you have an iPad?”

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what we can to process our grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.”

I paused. It was April. I had literally just  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here?

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are you feeling okay?” he asked with a glare.

I was at a loss for words for a moment. “Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?”

He and my brother both stared at me, confused.

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled.

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously.

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.”

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call. The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen.

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.”

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?”

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad.

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled.

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave.

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.”

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile.

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.”

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and immediately drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal.

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red.

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome.

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset.

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one.

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.”

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.”

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually did get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?”

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised.

“A bed? Like a whole bed?”

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.”

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket.

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.”

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib.

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter.

“I- this is- how’d you even,”

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?”

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.”

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them.

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie.

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.”

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room.

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie.

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly.

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see.

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.”

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke.

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints.

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces.

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod.

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith.

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes.

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face.

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.”

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity.

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out.

I awoke in my bedroom.

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family.

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?”

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members.

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance.

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms.

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison.

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance.

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels.

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes.

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing. The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers.

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1o4crdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o4crdi/writing_a_story_for_creepcast_would_appreciate/,"Writing a story for creepcast, would appreciate some feedback for my part 1.","I was asked to inspect a research station in Sao Tome. I regret going.

I sat on the edge of a leather couch, the ocean swaying the yacht gently. I clasped my hands and leaned forward.
“So, when do I get to know what I’m reviewing?” I asked to the well-dressed man that sat across from me. His name was Michael Sorata. He wore a blue three-piece suit, contrasted by a Cubs baseball cap, with a gold studded cane rested across his lap.
“You’ll figure it out.” he replied bluntly. “But it will be worth your time, I can promise that.” He gave me a sleazy smirk. I leaned back and glanced over my shoulder, out the window. Michael spoke again. “We expect that it won’t take too long, couple days max. The engineers we’ve hired have done an immaculate job and it shooould be able to hold them in.”
I looked back at him and furrowed my brow. “Them?” I once again leaned forward, waiting for him to elaborate. Irritatingly he did not. Instead he just looked at me blankly for a few moments before slapping his thighs and standing, holding his cane to his side.
“Well, I’m going to get some fresh air. Feel free to help yourself to anything on the boat. While you’re a guest of Genesis, you’re able to do anything.” He gave me a wink, motioning at the heavily stocked bar and then exited out onto the deck. I stood and smoothed out my creased jeans. I walked over to the bar and looked through the glass cabinets, picking out a fancy wine. I looked over at the wine glasses before popping the cork from the bottle and taking a swig. I wiped my lips and set the bottle down on a polished marble counter. The ship tilted, sending the bottle over the edge of the counter and smashing on the wooden floor. 
“Ah, fuck.” I muttered. I looked around for some paper towels before deciding to just let some poor deckhand clean it up. They’d find it eventually. I followed Michael out onto the deck and looked out at the sea. We were off the coast of West Africa, sailing to an island called São Tomé. I wasn’t exactly sure why I was invited to inspect a research station by Genesis, a company renowned for its widely successful treatments against previously incurable diseases, but I figured they must have been having some trouble with engineering. Probably something to do with me being a career engineer.
I heard someone walking towards me and turned to face them. It was a burly man with a security vest on. He had a large, visually modified cattle prod on his left hip and a pistol on his right. He passed me and started to converse with Michael, who stood at the bow. I walked up a flight of stairs to my room and turned in until we reached land. 

I woke to the sound of knocking. I swung the door open just as the timid deckhand went to knock again. We looked at each other awkwardly for a moment before he spoke.
""Hey mister Angioti. We're about to pull into the dock, so mister Sorata asked me to fetch you."" He turned to lead me off the boat.
""Hold on, just let me grab my things."" I said. He looked back at me.
""No need. Someone will come get them for you shortly, mister Angioti."" He walked towards the gangway and I followed closely behind. My feet hit concrete as I stepped onto the pier. I looked around the large dock and noticed tens of Genesis signs. Michael stood before me beside a man wearing slacks with a plaid checkered shirt. He was a big man and had an arrogant look plastered on his face. He stepped forward and offered his hand.
""I take it you're the reviewer? Name's Steve Hardy. I overlook the engineering here."" He had an Australian accent. I shook his hand.
""Bill Angioti.""
""Good to meet you Bill. Y'know what's going on here?"" 
""Yeah, you guys want me to take a look at something right? Inspect something?""
""Well, yeah, but,"" he paused and narrowed his eyes slightly, biting his lip. He leaned in to Michael and whispered something to him. Michael shook his head slightly. Steve clapped his hands together. ""Well, let's get going. Michael's going back to the mainland so you might not see him again. Don't worry, you're in good hands."" 
As he said it, Michaels jaw clenched ever so slightly as he looked past me, out at the sea. He waved over two armed men.
""Goddamned sp-"" He stopped himself. ""Spy's back out at sea. Get some guys on it, now,"" he told them. ""And use X9 stimulant, not the X1, otherwise he'll never wake up."" The men nodded and jogged to the other side of the dock, where a large patrol boat was waiting. There was a large machine mounted on the front that looked like a huge spear gun. They called over to a group of people that were playing cards around the boat, who picked up firearms and ran onto the ship. Curiously, although they each had a unique gun, they all had a cattle prod on their hip.
There was something strange about the way that he had mentioned the spy, but I couldnt quite place why. Michael cleared his throat. ""Well, I guess I won't be leaving just yet. Somethings just come up. I will be heading up to the lodge, so I still likely won't see you until later, but if you need me just give me a call. You should have unlimited data, so don't think twice about contacting me. I trust you have my details?""
""Yeah, they were on the contract you had me sign."" I replied.
Michael clasped his hands together. ""Amazing. I will see you fine gentlemen later."" He turned and walked to the other side of the dock, where a black limousine sat. The windows were tinted, but I could still make out the metal bars that were on the inside. They looked almost like prison windows.
While I was watching him leave, a dark green jeep pulled up next to us. The window rolled down and I saw a black man with aviators wearing a tan Genesis cap looking at Steve. 
""Sorry im late. One of the damn birds tried getting off with my gun, so I had to get one of the guys to taze it."" He said. He sounded tense. ""There's a problem with the walls on E3, so we'll need to get there now."" He looked at me. ""You'll be getting out there now, sorry. I'll tell someone to take your bags to the hotel."" 
Steve got in the passenger seat and I followed suit, getting in the back of the jeep. I learned that the driver's name was David, an animal handler, and he was a veteran who served in Iraq. 
""So what is E3?"" I asked him, looking for a way to pry something about what I was doing here.
""Its an enclosure. We have twelve of them, and usually theyre all in perfect nick. Lucky you came today, because this is the first time in three years we've had any problems. We've sedated everything in it, so don't worry about that."" 
I paused.
""What's in it?""
Steve chipped in, side-eying David. ""Just a few flightless birds. Genesis is taking a swing at some, uh, de-extinction of animals that humans have caused. You know what a Moa is?"" I shook my head. ""Well, its a big old thing that was native to New Zealand. Kind of like an emu or an ostrich. That's one of the things in E3. They aren't very dangerous, but we just don't want them escaping so we sedated them.""
""Well, what's the problem with the fence?""
David bit his lip while Steve continued to speak. ""Big old tree smashed down on the fence last night during a windstorm. Figured that you should come down and give us advice on how to reinforce the fences and stop it happening again.""
I sat back in my seat and watched the jungle pass as rain began to fall against the windows.

After about twenty minutes of driving, it came into view. The fence loomed ahead, metal bars glinting in the rain, humming faintly with electricity. Something about it didn’t make sense for just a few flightless birds. I saw a sign hanging from one of the bars that read

DANGER 12500 VOLTS

""Hey, what're the big fences for?"" I asked.
""Keep poachers out."" Steve replied.
It wasnt a satisfying answer, but I could tell I wasnt going to get anything else out of him. I guess Genesis had money to just throw at this place. 

Another ten minutes passed and the destroyed section of fence came into view. Dozens of people in overalls worked on cutting broken struts and replacing them with fresh ones. There were two large cranes that were set up, obviously needed to move the huge tree off of the fence. It was an old Santiria Balsamifera, probably a couple hundred years old. As we pulled up next to the workers, I noticed something. About ten of the men weren't workers at all, but more security guards. They all seemed uneasy, keeping their hands on their guns at all times. The workers all seemed even more anxiety filled. They never turned their back to the enclosure, never moved past the fence and their eyes darted around the foliage. 
""What's everyone so scared of?"" I asked Steve.
""Well, y'know, jungle legends 'n' shit. The workers are native to the island and they've convinced half the staff here of their little myths. Real annoying for trying to get anything done, but these guys work like animals."" He said with a slight laugh. ""Judging by the damage id say we'll be here about four or five hours, so you'll get a bit of a look at how things work here.""
I stepped out of the jeep and was hit by the humidity of the jungle. It was almost overpowering, and felt like a different country compared to the cool breeze at the dock. into the light rain and walked over to the fence. It looked like it could keep about anything in. I noticed an absence of any vehicles, aside from the trucks that carried the cranes. 
""Hey, where are all the cars at?"" I called back to Steve.
""What cars?"" 
""The cars these guys use to get around.""
Steve laughed ""They walk to and from the main facility""
I raised an eyebrow ""Really? Why?'
""Gotta keep costs down somehow"" he said, tapping his temple.
They had to keep costs down by not providing transport to their workers when they could afford huge, electric fences to protect birds? I shook my head. Damn corporate Suits.

Steve wasn't lying when he said it would take a few hours. It was just about dusk when we got back into the jeep, despite the fact that the fence wasn't fully repaired yet. I was shocked at the conditions that the contractors worked through here. Steve was right, they were animals.
David was pretty reckless with his driving to the main station. On the journey to the worksite, we'd been driving about fifty kilometers an hour, already a stupidly fast speed for the narrow corners and bumpy terrain. Now we were hitting almost eighty. He wove around trees like he was a rally driver, and his eyes kept flicking to the rear view mirror. The rain had slowly turned into a downpour over the past hour, and the dirt path was turning to mud. Suddenly a shadowed figure leapt across the road in front of us and David slammed on the breaks. Steves hand went to his hip, resting on his prod, before moving to the handgun that sat on the dashboard. 
""Shit."" David mumbled under his breath. He leaned into the jeeps radio. ""One out by..."" he looked at Steve.
""E10"" said Steve, who was opening the glove box and retrieving a rail-mounted flashlight, attaching it to the bottom of his pistol and winding down the window to illuminate the wet jungle.
David continued speaking into the radio. ""One out by E10. Check the map, the log, everything. Gonna need a team down here in the morning. Conditions are too harsh tonight.""
He put the jeep back into gear and sped up the path again. The interaction left me unnerved. I had talked to some of the contractors while we were working, and some of them had interesting things to say. They told me stories of terrible animals that would stalk you through the jungle and then, the instant you looked away, they would pounce. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to believe them. Just then, there was a low rumbling cry in the distance, almost like a foghorn. I felt it resonate in my chest, and it drove a chill down my spine. I felt my heart beating prominently in my chest, before I noticed David's hands whiten as they tightened slightly on the wheel, and his foot pressed even harder on the accelerator. Steve wound up his window.

When we finally got to the facility, I was stunned to find a heavy gate in front of it. The fence it was attached to was even heavier than the ones surrounding the enclosures. They seemed more akin to the outer layer of a fortress, and this idea was accompanied by the watchtower that loomed above us, harbouring spotlights that lit up the road and surrounding jungle. We pulled up next to a camera and after a moment or two the gate slowly swung open and we drove inside. A humongous building lay before us, looking more like a mall than a research station. Hundreds of cars were parked inside of the fence, along with tens of trucks parked beside a loading bay on the side of an offshoot of the building. Michael was standing on his own beneath the overhang, the only person outside amidst the pelting rain and chilly temperatures. We left the jeep in the parking zone and walked to meet him. He held his arms wide, still holding his cane. I hadn't actually seen him use it much, so I figured it was more for show than for actual use.
""So glad you finally made it. How did the job go?""
Steve grunted. ""Still going, but its fine.""
""Good, good.""
""I'll leave Bill with you. I'm sure he's tired."" Steve said, already walking into the building with David behind him. Michael beckoned me after him as he too walked inside. As soon as I walked through the door, hundreds of people surrounded me. People carrying papers and folders, surrounded by even more armed men. Seriously, why were there so many people with firearms here? We walked through the lobby and into a humongous chamber, with a large digital map on an oval table in the center of it all.
""Welcome to the conference room."" He said with a grand flourish of his arms.
There were only a couple people here, most had signed out for the night, and Michael said a quick hello to them. 
""This is a map of the whole facility, including all of the enclosures."" Michael told me proudly. ""We spare no expense on the grandeur of our creation."" In each enclosure there were a series of red dots. They were all static and had tags, usually a letter and then a number. I guessed it was the name and tag of animals. Michael hit a buzzer on the table and a teenager came in.
""Dylan, get me a coffee and a donut please."" He turned to me. ""You want anything, Bill? You can get anything you'd like.""
""Uh, sure, a banana milkshake sounds good.""
Michael turned and waved away the teenager.
I looked back at the map and noticed that there was a small cluster of blue dots on the edge of Enclosure Three, and thats when I noticed three red dots that were moving. I looked up at Michael, who was busy talking in a hushed tone with the other people in the room.
""Hey, Mike-'
""Michael."" He said, with a hint of strange pleasure. ""Please call me Michael. What can I do you for?"" He smiled.
I bristled at his interruption. ""Why are these three dots moving?""
He came over and studied the map. The dots moved towards the hole in the fence. He furrowed his brow and bit his lip. 
""Just stay here a moment."" He walked quickly back to the others and turned away from me, saying something to them. I didnt catch it all.
""Yeah...issue...no, no...it'll be fine...guns ready...alright."" He turned back to me and smiled again as one of the people he had talked to produced a cell phone from her pocket and spoke into it.
""Those dots are assets. Must have woken up and are trying to see what all the fuss is about. Dont want them escaping so I've told the guys to sedate them again.""
He led me out of the conference room and led me up a flight of stairs to a deserted hallway.
""Here are the guest rooms. You'll be in the one at the end, so make yourself comfortable. I sent some people to retrieve your things earlier, so just tell me if anything is missing. Have a good night, Bill."" He said with a friendly smile before turning on his heels and strutting away.

The night passed in the blink of an eye, and I was called down to the lobby. Michael meets me once more, dressed in a different golden three piece suit, this time with a man in all black wearing shades. I thought he looked a bit stupid wearing them inside, but who was I to judge.
""This is Elias. He's one of the heads of security here. We'll be showing you through some of our protocols and systems today, so just follow us."" They led me through an abundance of rooms, the building seeming to stretch on and on, before we entered the security headquarters. Just in this room alone there was easily two hundred people. They were all relaxed, lounging at desks behind monitors that showed assorted cameras and layouts. Plastered on the wall most nosticeably was a large screen, split up into three parts. One third was a conglomerate of about fifteen different people, another was full of cameras that showed a boat at sea, and the last showed a radar. I stared at the screen while Elias and Michael were talking to some of the security team. I frowned. The radar showed two green dots. One, at the center, was obviously the boat, which was the same one I had seen in the port yesterday. But there was another dot on it too, right next to the boat. I looked back and forth, but none of the cameras were showing anything else. Then I noticed a smaller screen, one that had only a few words on it, perched above a picture.

UNDERGOING RECONTAINMENT
ASSET 105 - SPINO

The picture was of a large animal, with a weird shape to it. It had a long snout, like that of a crocodile, and an even longer tail. But most peculiarly, its spine was unusually...tall? And it almost looked like a hand-fan perched on its back.
Dear God, I thought to myself as I looked back at the radar. I had been wrong wrong. It wasn't a spy out at sea.
The cameras showed a spiny sail breaching the surface, causing a wave of water to splash onto the boats deck. I could hear shouting through the speakers as the crew of the ship all started moving at once. The security headquarters went deadly quiet as people processed what was happening. On the screen I saw handguns being drawn and strange syringes being loaded into launchers.  Suddenly the room was alive once more, people shouting to each other and running to and fro. 
Michael grabbed me and began to push me out of the room while Elias ran to a control panel. My eyes remained glued to the cameras. One man ran to the mounted harpoon gun and began to aim it at the beast. As he did, it smashed its huge body against the boat, sending it rocking. The man lost his foothold on the slippery deck and tumbled over the guardrail and into the water, and then the door closed and I could see no more.

Fun event where you’ll build something that can identify these personas and make the internet a bit safer and less toxic for everyone. 

Hey Melbournites/Melbeople/Melbournians, not sure if you’ve noticed but the internet is becoming a crazy place. 
We’ve got manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, misinfo and disinfo, social media bans for children and teens, that Netflix show ‘Adolescence’, and it’s getting harder to tell what’s AI slop. 
So I’m putting on an event with the Australian Governments eSafety Commissioner, and University of Melbourne as part of the “16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence” campaign in November. 

It’s a fun event where we’ll come together and we’ll learn about these groups and build something that can help us identify these personas and hopefully work towards making the internet safer/better. 

There’ll be big prizes, catering, free coffee and it’s hosted in Melbourne CBD Nov 29-30. 

I’ve put a lot of work into making it fun, survivor friendly and enlightening so please give it a look! Even if you don’t end up coming please just give it a look :)

1o4cpe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/1o4cpe2/watching_the_autumn_of_breakups_and_i_have_a/,Watching “The Autumn Of Breakups” and I have a problem with the clock reset/unpause debate,"So to recap, Victoria is dropping major hints to Ted that she wants to get married, and at the climax of the episode, Ted proposes. 

Ted tries to claim that after they broke up the first time, the clock resets, the time they were together to start out with doesn’t count and that they need to date for awhile first. Lily, Marshall, and Victoria all say the opposite, that the time they spent together before counts.

I can see both sides of this argument, but I got to thinking about it, and Ted and Victoria were not together for very long the first time. I looked it up and according to google (take that with a grain of salt) they dated for two months the first time, and five months the second time. And there were six years in between. 

Isn’t it a little insane that she wants to rush into that big of a commitment? Even if the time that came before the breakup counts, that’s only seven months total. I could justify this a little bit if you want to say they’ve kept in touch in the meantime, but they haven’t. The show pretty much outright says they haven’t. When Ted runs into Victoria again at the Architect’s ball, he is completely surprised to see her, and even more he’s surprised that she’s soon to be engaged. If they had kept in touch, you’d think he’d at least know she was seeing someone, right? And then a few months later when he calls her up to find out if Klaus ever popped the question, she shows up in her wedding dress. Meaning that she never told Ted that he did propose. 

I don’t know about y’all, but I start to forget things after awhile. After my last breakup, I started to regret what I said and tried to get her back two months later, and by that point I realized that I had forgotten her coffee order. After being with her for six months. Pretty close to the amount of time Ted and Victoria dated over the course of six years. They definitely needed another “get to know you” stage because they undoubtedly forgot things about each other. Well maybe not Ted, given the detail he’s putting into telling the kids the story, but even so, people can change a lot in six years. ",0,1760233209.0,HIMYM,0,0.5,False

So. Freaking. Good. 

I knew I wouldn't be able to get that pistachio mousse home, so I devoured that in the car. So rich and delicious. Just incredible quality. 

Overall, A+. Pricey, but you get what you pay for, and this was worth it. I may find myself coming here every Saturday night, at least until I've tried every dessert.

1o4ckhu,https://i.redd.it/cj5hhlbt3luf1.jpeg,Sponsor Small Theatre,"Hi everybody!

I am a theatre maker in Orlando, FL. My theatre company, Chimera Productions (which you can find on Instagram and hopefully one day on a website), is putting on A Midsummer Night’s Dream in March. Casting closed today, so as we begin to review the self tapes and prepare for callbacks, we also are beginning our long promotional period (which is why we cast so early). We plan to do a Shakespeare exhibition at a college campus in Orlando to encourage people to see the show, advertise at open mics or small coffee lounges like Stardust and Austin’s, and hold other promo events and do things like the National Theatre does on TikTok to advertise.

We’ll also be applying for as many grants as we can.

I am a first time director and I’d really love for this to go well. I have a vision in mind and I’d love to see it come to fruition. On top of that, this production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream is dedicated to uplifting women’s voices in theatre, and most members of the cast and crew are women. I’d very much like to pay the cast and crew, and they will be paid 100% of all tips and whatever is left over from the production. (We are casting 12 actors, a stage manager, a costume designer, a lighting designer, a sound designer, and a scenic designer. The creation of the set will be a collaborative effort of the cast).

This is NOT professional theatre, and we are all college students for the most part.

I can provide my proposal, the scene-by-scene analysis, a redacted copy of the venue agreement with our venue, and a prospective budget on both the low and high end. 

For those who are interested in donating more than a small amount (over 50$), please DM me if you’d like a special place in the program (an honorable mention, an ad placement, a thank you), or if you’d like to sponsor a specific cost for the production (one actor’s costume, a night of the venue, the cost of the scripts, etc), so you can be provided an itemized list of what your donation will be purchasing. 

Everyone who donates any amount and attaches their Reddit username in the Venmo message will receive a high quality recording of the production. 

Thank you!

Im like literally obsessed with watching these reddit relationship posts on TikTok but I never thot I'd be   posting one 😭 but im in a bad spot and I need advice y'all 😩 I think I've made my bf insecure about his height and I feel so bad 😭

ok so I matched with my bf on tinder this summer and he's so sweet. like literally the sweetest guy I've ever dated. like he's the only guy I know who isn't embarrassed to say he's a feminist and when I told him im into sports he was just excited to talk to me about it instead of quizzing me on random ass facts like so many guys do. if ur a girl into guy things then yk.

so a couple months ago we had dinner w my friends + their bfs. but I had such an awful day and I was in such an awful mood bcuz I was pmsing (maybe tmi?? 🫣 lol idk) and I had like 3 very rude customers during my shift so I went to the dinner just bitchy af. I was also kinda stressing over this dinner cuz all he was meeting my entire friend group for the 1st time. also me and my friends used to make fun of short dudes (sorry to all the short kings reading. ik better now.) so I was extra stressed that maybe one of my friends would say smth stupid during dinner but my bf was super cool with everyone and everyone liked him. its just when all the guys got together to take a group pic and he looked so short it just ruined my mood even more (ik it was stupid af 😭 pls dont hate on me). I didn't want to feel that way but I think I was just looking at things to get annoyed at that night and then when we were at my place after dinner, my bf asked me why my mood was off so I said him being so much shorter than the other guys pmo (on my life I regretted it the second I said it).

it took a week of apologizing but we’re still together now but like  it lowkey hasn’t been the same since. even though i’ve apologized like a million times, told him i don’t care about his height anymore, but he still gets insecure randomly. the most recent one is what made me write this post bcuz it breaks my heart each time.

now since we became exclusive, every Friday he comes to where I work bcuz my shift and his classes end at the same time and his campus is nearby and then we go to either of our places to hang out. yesterday ig his last class got canceled so she showed up an hour early and it was rlly cute cuz he came up to me and acted like he didn't know me but flirted with me while he ordered his coffee and it made my day. anyway, he just sat and drank his coffee while I worked and me and this guy always work the same shifts so we're friendly with each other. so while we worked, my coworker made a couple of jokes and made me laugh but I wasn't touchy or anything. just friendly. I think my bf must've been triggered by that bcuz he asked me that evening if I find the coworker more attractive since he's tall and like hello???? ofc I dont 😫 I think my bf is the most handsome dude everrrr but he finds it hard to believe that at times and I'm like how do I fix this??? cuz I dont want him feeling insecure over his height anymore. I literally DONT CARE and knowing that he thinks I find other guys hotter just bcuz they're taller breaks my heart. I spent all of today crying bcuz its all my fault and he's so sweet that he shouldn't be feeling this way 🥺 and he isn't even SHORT. he's like 5'8ish and i think our height difference is super cute. (i'm 5'6) i dont even wear heels anymore just in case it might make him feel bad.

i just want him to believe me when i say i think he’s hot + i’m super attracted to him. i feel like i ruined it by being shallow that one night and now he can’t un-hear it. i genuinely don’t see him as “short” anymore, i just see him as MY bf, but idk how to actually get him to believe that.

how do i fix this??

So… which wins? The priceless glitch or the priceless message? I still can’t decide. 😅

Overall, it was a calm and affectionate relationship— easy to talk to, normal arguments that didn’t over escalate, no cheating, just the usual disagreements. He’s a good man in many ways: loyal, caring, the type who would show love through gestures more than words. He often brought me coffee at work or checked in with small things, and we’d go out at least once a week for dinner or something fun. My work schedule is complicated I work all the time and he has more free time from work or more flexibility. I’d contribute with groceries, coffee/dessert, occasional take-out, or little personal touches like handwritten letters or home-cooked meals. It felt balanced—not 50/50 financially, but fair.

Things started shifting over the past couple of months. He became emotionally guarded and, honestly, a bit cheap. He earns comfortably more than I do, but suddenly started saying he was spending too much and preferred staying in. When I offered to cover an outing, he’d refuse—but then go golfing or out with friends within days. (He golfs about 3-4 times a week). And started hiding golfing from me. I noticed because when I’d see him he’d smell obviously from being out in the sun and he’d thought I wouldn’t notice. It’s a white little lie but all accumulated it made me feel a certain way. He would tell me his plans early morning before I left for work and while I was brushing my teeth or something. Like avoiding conversation or engagement. I let
Him know once that I don’t like when he tells me things last minute it Makes me feels unconsidered like he wouldn’t care of my thoughts on his plans. Like He also left to Europe for his bday with his friends (male & female) and never invited me he’d just say “I wish I could’ve taken you with me”. If it’s your birthday you definitely want to consider your partner for a milestone in your life wouldn’t you? He came back expecting me to plan something big for him when I already felt a certain way I wasn’t even asked once. It wasn’t about money itself; it was the mixed signals that made me feel like I wasn’t a priority.

He would be acting different socially at times. Around his best friend he was very warm and attentive I felt very cool and comfy, but around another group he seemed a bit more cold idk if embarrassed to show affection, giving them more attention than me. We went to a trivia night once and he didn’t even interact with me to know if I was okay or comfortable. Once we left I told him it made me feel left out and disconnected and felt anxious. He apologized and promised to do better, but the next time he invited me, I declined out of anxiety, and he went anyway. He frequently invited me with them but never fully showed me he would be different around them. 

I kept trying to communicate my feelings calmly. I never expected constant texting, just some consistency or the occasional call or FaceTime since we didn’t always see each other often. Instead, he’d text midday, rarely initiate calls, and when he traveled for his birthday he went to the other extreme—sending dozens of “I love you” texts that felt performative. When I brought up that emotional balance, he said he didn’t know what else I wanted and insisted he was already trying his best. I’m not that clingy I’m usually independent, I work a lot I have my hobbies and I workout a lot. He usually the same he works maybe not as much as me but works, golfs, works out and occasionally goes out more than I do. 

One of our last conversations was after I said I couldn’t see him one evening because I had errands and the gym. He demanded to know exactly what I was doing and accused me of not planning things or initiating or reciprocating effort. That was when I realized we were in a blame loop instead of working together. I told him by text that I was done—it just didn’t feel like a partnership anymore. I didn’t want to argue all I expressed was that I needed consistency in effort and communication and he insisted he’d been doing it well. Instead of talking things through and hearing each other out to improve for both. 

The next day he dropped off flowers, coffee and a snack but didn’t say his intentions or why just froze little back and forth of how his day went and he left. I thought he’d send me a text to express himself but nothing, I later texted within a few hours and thanked him for the beautiful flowers. Last time he gave me flowers was two months ago. And he hadn’t dropped coffee or anything even though the commute to drive is about 15min. When we met to exchange belongings, he said he loved me but left the decision entirely up to me—no attempt to talk it through or ask what went wrong. All this time he was a bit defensive and tried to justify himself and mainly justify that he was right. He even gave me back the small love letters, a painting I made him and details I’d made him and given to throughout the relationship which was harsh. 

I know I have flaws too. I can be emotional and anxious and maybe I expect a bit more reassurance than most, but I genuinely tried to make things work. He’s a kind, loyal person, but very emotionally reserved. I’m a big yapper and can express my emotions but I constantly have to try and be more open and patient so he can feel comfortable expressing himself instead of keeping it to himself. 
Know how he’s feeling or reading the room and noticing he’s anxious or stressed and having to approach and ask. I feel stressed mainly from work and I would spiral at times. He would just say things like “you work hard” and make me a bubble bath. Gotta give it to him though with the bubble baths it was out little moments to de stress. Anyway, I just kept feeling like I was doing the emotional labor—trying to connect while he stayed behind a wall.

So now I’m torn. Did I do the right thing by ending it? Or was it something we could have fixed if we’d both put in the effort differently? Has anyone been in this situation with someone who struggles emotionally or with vulnerability?

1o4ccjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1o4ccjg/i_cant_make_a_category_for_this/,I can’t make a category for this.,"Let me start this off with my parents. I’m first born in this country and I’m almost 11 years difference from my older sister. My father is Serbian and my mother is Croatian; they sent my sister overseas for the better part of her pre-K to kindergarten years. She comes back and I can’t attest to what happened but I will tell you my mother is a waitress/bartender and my father is a tool and die maker. When I grew up, my mother worked Tuesday through Saturday and doing doubles on Saturdays, which included her normal work schedule was 3 o’clock to closing and that could be 10 or 11 o’clock during the week and Saturdays were 10 AM till closing… Sometimes she would do Sundays, but Monday she was off. 

Mondays were my worst nightmare; I was too young to understand that the time she did all of the cleaning and whatever on Mondays but I felt like I was constantly being incessantly screamed at or in trouble.

My father did have a brother that lived in the states; they moved to Florida they were a couple years apart from my sister so she had somebody I had nothing. If you would include my godparents and their kids that might be something, but that really didn’t count for anything. 

My godparents got in between my father and his brother and his brother‘s wife, and these people are so immature that it affected me even seeing a cousin, and that was the only thing I had at one point; it was ripped from me. 

Apparently, when my mother was done giving birth to me, my godmother, who was a friend who my parents looked at his friends because they didn’t know anybody in New York came in and swooped in like a vulture and my mother just said yes to anybody outside of her own family ; that’s why they are my godparents.


Back to Mondays when I was home as a kid; my mother either spent one of two things doing asking me what was needed or was not needed out of school work brought home in my backpack. “What is needed?” and I want you to ask a six-year-old this… A lot of it got thrown out and then when it did and the teacher called, she forgot everything and I got screamed at for about two days straight and smacked, and she didn’t know how to handle anything.

Also, these godparents would have coffee with my parents and make up stories about their kids about how great they were. Ending those nights would be a nightmare, and I would be compared to them even in person to include other people. So for example, you go meet a new set of parents with your kid and asked their kid in front of everybody. What’s your average? My parents weren’t gems and also they were manipulated by these assholes.

The second thing was my mom repetitively checked in on me to see if everything was in order. Mind you “in order” was screaming at the top of her lungs and throwing things around.

I grew to like school; most people LOVE to be sent home from school; not me. Getting sent home sick and not closing the door behind me fast enough was a high piercing scream in English and Croatian to do so.

She believed everything bad about me to the point where someone prank called my house and said I did something and she believed it pretending to be a fucking school official. 

Let’s fast forward without too much detail, even though this is long and drawn out I appreciate anybody that is actually reading this .

June 1997 we moved to Florida and I go to the worst Fucking school underneath the sun with a bunch of gang bangers (some 16 or 17 in eighth grade) without them even checking the school out; mind you the place we lived was a retirement area so don’t worry they’re not gonna be there. I’ll just go to school to deal with assholes and be alone riding my bike amongst a bunch of fucking people that are 80 with no one around.

We move back and I meet some good friends, mind you I was young. 

After a lot of trial by error, I decide to go into the military, which was met by severe opposition by everybody, including my sister who thinks she’s a third parent.

I had a very good run of five years, but the unfortunate thing was in my branch and my job. They were downsizing, especially after 9/11 and unless you went and recruited people or pushed boots, (drill Sgt; drill, instructor; recruit division commander; the person in any of the branches that train them in Boot Camp, etc..) you were OUT; so I went reserves while I tried to rebuild my life.


Again, I’m sorry about the long diatribe, but I feel some people need the whole picture before they make a comment; thank you for reading if you are reading; it means a lot. 

I want to the hiring processes for certain jobs in law-enforcement and actually landed one while working plumbing and heating and completing college while also going through EMT school in case that didn’t work out.


It all worked out, but at this point, my parents are in such terrible health. I don’t know what the hell to do; I’ve given them pointers which they don’t seem to grasp when it comes to being financially stable even after death and not dumping it on anybody. 

I also think that they are being very well guided by my sister when it comes to that; my only thing is if they do pass, I don’t want those silly ass people who are my so-called godparents who are vultures to come even into the funeral home I wanna be there at the door to tell them they’re not welcome. 


The last time I saw my godparents one kid he was being so argumentative. It reminded me of his father and I don’t wanna fucking be around him either because he was a screaming little brat who got money shower to him and he was always right and I got my head thrown into a fucking wall Just for talking back because my parents only cared about their friends. That’s including my so-called godparents.

If I didn’t have such a strong base of people, including my daughter, who loves them, I would say you know what they can have their funeral with those fucking assholes, but part of me thinks I should exclude those pricks from the funeral completely and have someone check IDs at the door. Make it a full fledge members only to show them they do not get the last laugh and they should be reminded they are not part of OUR complete family. I do not want these people have a last laugh while my parents are in a grave thinking they have the right to be there.

Went to the store and bought like 5 different sets of work friendly outfits and 2 bras in my ACTUAL size, since I am now OFFICIALLY back on the job market. I really hope I find something with full time hours. ;3;. I have a plan to save for and ZERO sugar daddies. And I am NOT built for OnlyFans. XD lmao. 

I have made this month a full focus on a ""glow up""/ purging and it's been crazy. So I decided I am following the deep winter color palette from here out and literally purged 7 bags of clothes that either don't fit me anymore or didn't flatter me. (I love fashion... and I've been told my wardrobe is fucking GIGANTIC. which.... that's not wrong OwO...) And I FINALLY found out my actual bra size... let me tell ya.... finding that answer out HAS NOT been easy. It's taken trial, error, and a lot of being felt up... OwO.

But, Dude. The moment I wore a bra in my ACTUAL size? I look like I lost a whole pant size AND I can finally stand up straight! ;3;. Mama Mia. Also, I can finally wear form fitting clothing without feeling like a fucking melted marshmallow. 🫠

Well. That's today's rant... brought to you by actually getting 9 hours of sleep 2 days in a row AND touching grass.

Basically think *Wings of Glory or X Wings* but with dragons, all about mid-air movement, positioning, and aerial combat.

The movement system is inspired by *Wings of Glory*, so it’s supposed to be really easy to pick up but still tactical. The idea of dragon warfare just sounds awesome. You actually get to pick different types of dragons, each with their own flying style and abilities, and even choose what kind of weapons or gear they equip before heading into battle. The mix of fantasy and tactical dogfighting seems like a really fun twist

Looks like it’s aiming for release around December from what I saw on Kickstarter. Anyone else seen this or have thoughts?

Basic girls were the popular girls that wore vineyards. Pony tail. Sleevless vest. High boots with the stocking. Leggings. They all drove jeeps

Some of them had seashell necklaces or scarfs. They all had hydroflask

I know the popular girls are still around but do they still dress like basic girls? 

Im fully sure the hydroflask have been replaced by the Stanley cup

They also bullied people and never got in trouble because there all AP honor students and drunk coffee",2,1760230952.0,teenagers,15,0.76,False

I watch TV and movies, go out when I feel like it, and travel to different cities a couple of times a year. But even with all that, it feels like time isn’t moving  like the years just aren’t passing.

I’m getting bored of everything I do. The shows I used to enjoy are over, and new ones just suck honestly. I used to love my coffee and having a drink once in a while, but I had to stop because of GERD. On top of that, I have chronic pain, so I can’t work out much without it flaring up.

Most of the people I knew are no longer around since I moved to a new place, and it’s just me most of the time now. Sometimes I find myself wondering when I’ll finally be old, like 60 or 70, so I can just stop caring and die peacefully.  just really bored of life and tired of dealing with health issues all the time",4,1760230889.0,NEET,4,1.0,False
