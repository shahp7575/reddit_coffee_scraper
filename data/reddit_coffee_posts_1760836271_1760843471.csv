1oaf2hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1oaf2hz/moving_from_the_us_to_paraguay/,Moving from the US to Paraguay,"My wife (32, F) and I (34, M) are planning to move to Paraguay, specifically near the capital of Asunción by the end of the year. We're and interracial couple, I'm white, she's black.

We don't have kids. I am a truck driver working for a company who delivers overpriced coffee products, and due to the economy, tariffs, and other policies in the US, as well as policies my company is implementing that make it easier to fire drivers, it is very likely I will lose my job in the next 6 months or so. It's hard to find other jobs right now, and none of them pay what my current job does. My wife gets SSDI, and works part time cleaning, but I'm the primary earner. We do have a bit of savings to pull from, about $40,000 in total, and she can continue to receive benefits. We own a house that we just bought last year that we intend to rent out, or sell if we can't rent it.

Reasons we chose Paraguay:

-Easy residency process and path to citizenship within 5 years. -Culture and language should be easier to adapt to than those in Asia. I used to speak Spanish years ago, it should be easy to pick up again. -Cost of living is insanely cheap. With our savings we would be good for a few years there, or would even have enough to start a small local business if we wanted to. -Stability, in the sense that things are always changing rapidly in the US, and that's unlikely to be the case in the same way in Paraguay. From what I've been able to gather, things stay pretty much the same. We can reasonably assume that unusually high tariffs won't dramatically increase the cost of goods overnight. -Food quality. It's incredibly expensive to get good quality food in the US, and much cheaper in Paraguay.

I see it as a bit of a risk, but I think it's less risky than staying in the US given the political climate, the economy, and our own situation. Her family thinks it's a smart decision. My family mostly disagrees.

1oaf1l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1oaf1l8/old_letter_prop_process/,Old Letter Prop Process,"I've gotten into a rhythm for creating old letter props for my games.

I type the letter out and use some cursive looking font. Print it. Rip the edges. Crumple it a bit. Put it into a metal tray and either, dab it with a freshly used tea bag that had some brown colored tea, or, bust open a freshly used K-Cup from the coffee machine and dump the rounds into the tray with the letter.

In the case of coffee grounds I add a bit more water and smear the coffee grounds around on both sides of the letter with a thicker napkin.

In case of the tea bag I add a bit more water and sort of let the letter soak a bit. Not a lot of water mind you, have to watch for tears.

Then I pop the entire metal try into the toaster and set it to bake for about 2 minutes.

That will usually get the dry and crispy. Then I'll hang it up for a while until it is totally dry, brush off any clingy coffee grounds, and all done.

A few times I used those laminating sheets on them to preserve them, but I think I'm over that. Chances are I will only use these once per PC group, ever, so if I get lucky that's what, like twice, maybe three times I would run the same adventure? If they get totally worn out I'll just remake them. More realistically though, the more worn out they look the better.

The coffee method goes a old, dirty, and burnt look. While the tea bag method is more just old and weathered. I have never tried getting a lighter out to burn the edges.

For a bit of context, I’m a 29 y/o female, 2 years post-partum and am desperately wanting to lose weight. I know what I should be doing, but one of my biggest barriers is snacking/mindless eating. 

In the mornings between breakfast and lunch, I am always wanting a “carby” snack (think muffins, scones, etc.). 

In the evenings, I’m often looking for something sweet (chocolate or cookies) and/or sometimes something salty (like chips or popcorn). The biggest problem I run into here is that I have a really hard time with limiting myself and I find that I want “volume”.

I’m looking for some healthier alternatives to these two “snack” cravings. I find my morning snack I’m craving something on the sweeter side to go with my coffee, where as in the evening I find I want sweet or salty, but in bulk (meaning I want to eat more volume).

1oaewhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oaewhs/lost_momentos_part_3/,Lost Momentos (Part 3),"As my form breached the sleeping face of the body of water, what first struck was the cold. Bone-chilling, brain freezing temperatures encased my rapidly descending self while bubbles of white and blue and rainbows glimmered all around me. Voice crying out, the sound was swallowed by the all encompassing void that was my presumed tomb of the past. Limbs straining against the still flow that threatened to consume me, the tranquility of the scenery was only broken by a loud splash following my futile resistance.  

Eyes shut tight, small puffy jacket clinging to my skin like Velcro, I remorse the lack of life jacket I had elected to leave on the vessel above me. The feeling of stinging cold rushes through my lungs as I'm forced to take my first small, shuddering breath of the strength-sapping atmosphere seeping into me slowly. All at once the panic fully set in as something warm brushed one of my minute arms. Struggling against the sudden resistance to my flailing, I lashed out with all my frail body held as the invader clung to me tight, kicking with all its might but missing me wholly. I clawed at the appendages restricting my movement until my face broke the surface of the icy cold lake I was held underneath. Blinking the water and icicles out of my lashes with chattering teeth, my eyes locked onto my mother's own pearlescent orbs. 

The full weight of a full grown soaking individual and their smaller soaked counterpart was heaved from the lake with every ounce of strength my father could muster. My mother and I landed in a heap atop him as the air chilled our liquid coating even further.  While she began compressions on my younger self my father busied himself with the engine of the little fishing boat. Pushing the engine as much as he possibly could while my frame was wrapped in anything dry they could scavenge from the boat. While the distance to the shore wasn't far, it seemed an eternity before we ran aground and our collective huddled together to scuttle inside the warm cabin den. 

My grandma was startled when we busted the door open and poured in, taking my little brother from my grandpa as he moved to help. With quickly produced blankets and towels, we were bundled up in minutes while we rubbed our extremities free of their lingering numbness. My father and grandpa went out on the porch to talk and drink from a fresh pot of coffee they'd already had going, as Grandma started heating up some warm apple cider for us to nurse on. Just when I'd just been handed a cup carefully, hands still shaking, the men's voices rose in fervor outside the heavy wooden door, emotions flaring but obscured when Grandpa slammed it open and walked to the back of the house furiously. 

\*\*\*

I must have hit my head on something when I jumped, if the throbbing pain emanating from my head was any indication. Dull pain being my first hint that I was still alive somehow woke me, as well as the frayed knot still holding my sanity together in this subterranean wasteland. Easing my eyelids apart I came to a second realization with a mild bit of panic at the unexpected resistance to my innocuous actions. They were coated in a familiar viscosity that I wiped away to clear my vision somewhat, finding the rest of my body in much the same state. I stripped my outermost layer of clothing, using what I can to clean away as much as possible from my face. 

Finally taking in my poorly lit surroundings I was met with a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my view. Stepping closer cautiously and finding solid ground ahead, I pull myself from the small pool I awoke laying in. As I close in my foot hits something solid and I'm practically ecstatic to find the flashlight pressed against my boot. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave the device some percussive maintenance with a few solid thwacks, and it flickered to life after the fourth or fifth swing. Thank fuck for DeWalt. 

With my current dwelling finally illuminated, the giddiness at the recovered tool is caught in my throat when the small hills I was creeping towards revealed themselves to be piles of bones from animals of all kinds. To my horror there seemed to be human remains dotted amongst the decay, the larger pieces still intact among the shattered bits of multiple skeletons. At the base of each was a large puddle of the same goop that still clung to myself, cracked green fragments laying in scattered patterns throughout the entirety of the room. 

As my breathing slowed and I inched my way back to the water and scanned for any more supplies that might've washed up with me, the only sound for a while was the dripping of water and my own steps while I wade through the shallow waters. To my luck I'm able to find the small shovel I'd brought down alongside a water bottle that was floating slowly in circles. Taking a small sip and reorienting myself with my current equipment, my next step was checking around for any other way out that didn't involve swimming. This meant getting closer to the rot, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the smell. 

Making a slow circle around the potential threat the piles presented, the lack of any change to the terrain gave me a slight sense of calm before I made it all the way to where I'd started the scoping out. With nothing to note on the walls or ceiling in regards to potential escape routes, I steel myself and start sorting through the closest gathering of ground up gore. The bones had been picked clean from what I could gather, and a slow rhythmic clattering began to rebound around the room as I sifted through. Closer to the base of the pile I found the viscera painted with a hardened layer of the cavern's coating, bits of that green glass like material stuck tight with their jagged edges facing outwards. 

As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I had the fortune of finding several discarded odds and ends from whatever was dumped down here. There were mainly scraps of fabric and bundles of fur that were left to the wayside, but I was able to scrounge together a shirt that was mostly intact from the mess. When I moved from my initially sorted piles to the next unfiltered stack, there was a brief moment of clarity while sound ceased. At least from myself. The slow clattering continues unabated, albeit unaccompanied by my own. As I freeze I see the bones of places aside, shivering some as a new presence threatens to burst free. Backing towards the water with my eyes locked on the movement, I hear a whir pitch up behind my hearing aids that echoes shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle. 

From within and almost melding into the bones surrounding them were pale and wriggling forms, worming their way free from their calcium covered enclosures. Moving in the same manner as a caterpillar, I saw dozens of them creep from where I'd just been kneeled down. As each wave appeared they joined the chorus ringing the space, waving heads pointed straight up, as if in prayer. With their front ends exposed, I saw in the rippling light refracted from the water the gaping maws of razor sharp rows each minute monstrosity held aloft. To my shock I saw a bevy of the same beings begin a similar set of procedures in the rest of the wretched refuse. Each mass shuddering and collapsing as dozens upon dozens of these creatures made themselves known to the world with shrieking cries. 

As I dropped to my knees and clawed at the sides of my face, I resisted every urge to rip out whatever semblance of mechanical assistance my ears possessed. Instead choosing to grab the flashlight and shovel in fear as I clambered backwards slowly before a splash broke my fevered concentration. I glanced behind me suddenly before whipping back around, hesitant to turn my attention from the frenzy unfolding. In that short moment however, I saw the mass of aquatic life I'd experienced previously working up to a flurry in the frothing pond. Taken aback by the sight, I halted my motion and focused on my current predicament above the wake. The creatures unleashing a torrid soprano that made my head spin all at once ceased any influence on me as the room fell to a standstill. 

Regaining my composure as the individual entities continued their upright posterity, it was multiple breaths before the sound of dragging arose, moving steadily closer to our current holdings. Taking the chance to click my flashlight off, I crouched down in a feeble attempt at concealing my presence. When my knee hit the ground finally, a form was dragged and eventually dropped upon the crowd of expectant invertebrates from the hazy covering above. Flinching at the impact of flesh on stone from a decent height, I braced myself before shining the light's sparse remaining battery towards the source of the deposit. When the ambient light illuminated my surroundings however, reflecting directly off of the studded and sparkled roof, I saw the crippled form of my father. 

Huddled together and missing one leg of his work jeans, although the rest of his clothes looked to be in a better state than mine. Displaying itself as I moved closer, still cautious of the frozen spawn surrounding us, most of his figure was conservatively stuck tight with only a handful of the same green spheres I'd seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. Not knowing his state of “aliveness,” I inched forward before the realization that the spheres looked even more familiar than initial inspection yielded. My foot brushing against something and causing a tinkling sound to ring out in the silence, I look down and see a shard. A green shard. 

My thoughts hit like a literal and metaphorical train as the end in one conclusion. Move. All stealth abandoned, I rush to my Pa’s side and check his pulse like health class taught. With a slow thrum I confirmed his continued existence, before taking my hands and shredding the bits of his uniform that were too stuck to the sickly pearls to extract. When my work was done, and the creatures around us stiff as ever, all that remained was a single external tumor on his right leg. His jeans remained as intact as I'd found him for the most part, and his over shirt had been completely coated, leaving behind a gray tank top beneath untouched. As I heaved his mostly free body to the side of the cave, one lone piece of bone separated itself from the rest, and fell to the floor. 

Raising my head at the sharp intrusion to the shuffling silence, I came to the conclusion I wasn't the only one drawn to the sudden noise. Each of the malformed, limbless things had ceased its unholy prayers, and turned their attention fully to the single bone that fell. While my breath hitched in my throat, I slowed my movement to a crawl, sliding off myself and my father against the ground seemingly not enough to alert them yet. When the movement of another of the worms caused a small avalanche of cream colored calcium, the monsters all together darted for the deluge. Twisting and engulfing any part of their presumed postmortem prey, the bundle grew in layers and size as they slid and intertwined with one another. Ideas and doubts racing through my mind, I picked a piece of what looked like a femur up from near my knelt down position, and tossed it towards the water amidst the feeding ball currently occuring. 

I was never good at any sports with a ball involved really, but this worked in my favor in this instance, as the piece landed short of the water by a few inches. Barely touching the waves ebbing to and fro from the scales bodies concealed beneath, the bone skittered to a stop with a slight ripple and splash. The ground based life forms took a moment to consult the validity of this new sound, before moving en masse and roiling around the new stimuli provided. As some slagged off of the main mass, the few unlucky enough to land in the liquid layer were quickly snatched and fought over by what gluttonous horrors awaited below the surface. 

Seeing the first light of hope, or maybe in my delusion the first action I felt confident enough to take given the bizarre situation, I rose carefully and braced myself against the wall while I gripped the handle of the shovel still strapped to my ragged leather belt. Placing my weight from the heels of my feet to the balls, I rocked my way as near as I could to the active empty buffet before me. Standing at attention within an arms length of the imminent danger, I eased the shovel from its bindings, eliciting a metallic -dink as it clashed against my belt buckle. The mass paused a bit, but continued with my unintentional warning unheeded in the slightest amidst potential food before it. Loosing the tool fully, I cocked my shoulders back and bent my knees in my best imitation of a golfer's stance. 

Slicing downward with all my might, I twisted my body up as the blade of the implement met solid flesh with a veritable slosh. Many of the cretins were damaged by the initial blow, but any that survived to some degree careened lopsidedly towards the far wall. The volleyball of veinless forms collided with rock hewn from the most solid of sediments, spewing parts of itself in a short circumference before collapsing into the water below. Residue from my actions made its home on the wall and shovel I held with dull purple murk. The presumed lifeblood of the munchkin land piranhas dripped from the cold steel I held while I reveled in the effectiveness of my actions in the moment. 

While the mysterious marine life enjoyed their unexpected all you can eat buffet, I moved myself a couple feet from the few remaining reptiles still chasing the location of the impact. Stabbing downwards I made sure to dispatch the last of the litters with haste, like one would any unsuspecting prey animal. As the flurry of motion in the pool waned off progressively, I felt the need for action drain from my body and mind, along with any coiled energy I held in tension. Crawling slowly towards the wall where my father lay up against, I curled up in the elbow of a few stones alongside him, quickly falling into the first and deepest sleep after all this time in the depths.

About 12 years ago, I fell into the world of tax sales, those county auctions where unpaid property taxes turn into opportunities for whoever’s willing to dig through messy records and deals with red tape. 

My first big win was a rundown house off highway 180; western New Mexico in a small college town. Everyone thought I was nuts for bidding on it. The roof had collapsed, the lot was overgrown, total eyesore. I bought it for about 7K, spent a few grand clearing title and demoing it, and ended up selling the lot to a Southwest coffee chain for just over six figures. That deal changed how I looked at ugly opportunities. 

Over the years, I kept meeting people curious about the space, RE investors, side hustlers, and blue collar individuals, all saying the same thing: why doesn’t anyone talk about this? 

So this year I started building a small business around it. It’s part media, part education, a way to share stories, data, and lessons from tax sales trenches. Im writing about both the wins and the screw-ups because, honestly that’s where the real learning happens. 

Im curious how others here have turned obscure expertise into something scalable.

\*\*\*

I must have hit my head on something when I jumped, if the throbbing pain emanating from my head was any indication. Dull pain being my first hint that I was still alive somehow woke me, as well as the frayed knot still holding my sanity together in this subterranean wasteland. Easing my eyelids apart I came to a second realization with a mild bit of panic at the unexpected resistance to my innocuous actions. They were coated in a familiar viscosity that I wiped away to clear my vision somewhat, finding the rest of my body in much the same state. I stripped my outermost layer of clothing, using what I can to clean away as much as possible from my face. 

Finally taking in my poorly lit surroundings I was met with a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my view. Stepping closer cautiously and finding solid ground ahead, I pull myself from the small pool I awoke laying in. As I close in my foot hits something solid and I'm practically ecstatic to find the flashlight pressed against my boot. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave the device some percussive maintenance with a few solid thwacks, and it flickered to life after the fourth or fifth swing. Thank fuck for DeWalt. 

With my current dwelling finally illuminated, the giddiness at the recovered tool is caught in my throat when the small hills I was creeping towards revealed themselves to be piles of bones from animals of all kinds. To my horror there seemed to be human remains dotted amongst the decay, the larger pieces still intact among the shattered bits of multiple skeletons. At the base of each was a large puddle of the same goop that still clung to myself, cracked green fragments laying in scattered patterns throughout the entirety of the room. 

As my breathing slowed and I inched my way back to the water and scanned for any more supplies that might've washed up with me, the only sound for a while was the dripping of water and my own steps while I wade through the shallow waters. To my luck I'm able to find the small shovel I'd brought down alongside a water bottle that was floating slowly in circles. Taking a small sip and reorienting myself with my current equipment, my next step was checking around for any other way out that didn't involve swimming. This meant getting closer to the rot, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the smell. 

Making a slow circle around the potential threat the piles presented, the lack of any change to the terrain gave me a slight sense of calm before I made it all the way to where I'd started the scoping out. With nothing to note on the walls or ceiling in regards to potential escape routes, I steel myself and start sorting through the closest gathering of ground up gore. The bones had been picked clean from what I could gather, and a slow rhythmic clattering began to rebound around the room as I sifted through. Closer to the base of the pile I found the viscera painted with a hardened layer of the cavern's coating, bits of that green glass like material stuck tight with their jagged edges facing outwards. 

As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I had the fortune of finding several discarded odds and ends from whatever was dumped down here. There were mainly scraps of fabric and bundles of fur that were left to the wayside, but I was able to scrounge together a shirt that was mostly intact from the mess. When I moved from my initially sorted piles to the next unfiltered stack, there was a brief moment of clarity while sound ceased. At least from myself. The slow clattering continues unabated, albeit unaccompanied by my own. As I freeze I see the bones of places aside, shivering some as a new presence threatens to burst free. Backing towards the water with my eyes locked on the movement, I hear a whir pitch up behind my hearing aids that echoes shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle. 

From within and almost melding into the bones surrounding them were pale and wriggling forms, worming their way free from their calcium covered enclosures. Moving in the same manner as a caterpillar, I saw dozens of them creep from where I'd just been kneeled down. As each wave appeared they joined the chorus ringing the space, waving heads pointed straight up, as if in prayer. With their front ends exposed, I saw in the rippling light refracted from the water the gaping maws of razor sharp rows each minute monstrosity held aloft. To my shock I saw a bevy of the same beings begin a similar set of procedures in the rest of the wretched refuse. Each mass shuddering and collapsing as dozens upon dozens of these creatures made themselves known to the world with shrieking cries. 

As I dropped to my knees and clawed at the sides of my face, I resisted every urge to rip out whatever semblance of mechanical assistance my ears possessed. Instead choosing to grab the flashlight and shovel in fear as I clambered backwards slowly before a splash broke my fevered concentration. I glanced behind me suddenly before whipping back around, hesitant to turn my attention from the frenzy unfolding. In that short moment however, I saw the mass of aquatic life I'd experienced previously working up to a flurry in the frothing pond. Taken aback by the sight, I halted my motion and focused on my current predicament above the wake. The creatures unleashing a torrid soprano that made my head spin all at once ceased any influence on me as the room fell to a standstill. 

Regaining my composure as the individual entities continued their upright posterity, it was multiple breaths before the sound of dragging arose, moving steadily closer to our current holdings. Taking the chance to click my flashlight off, I crouched down in a feeble attempt at concealing my presence. When my knee hit the ground finally, a form was dragged and eventually dropped upon the crowd of expectant invertebrates from the hazy covering above. Flinching at the impact of flesh on stone from a decent height, I braced myself before shining the light's sparse remaining battery towards the source of the deposit. When the ambient light illuminated my surroundings however, reflecting directly off of the studded and sparkled roof, I saw the crippled form of my father. 

Huddled together and missing one leg of his work jeans, although the rest of his clothes looked to be in a better state than mine. Displaying itself as I moved closer, still cautious of the frozen spawn surrounding us, most of his figure was conservatively stuck tight with only a handful of the same green spheres I'd seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. Not knowing his state of “aliveness,” I inched forward before the realization that the spheres looked even more familiar than initial inspection yielded. My foot brushing against something and causing a tinkling sound to ring out in the silence, I look down and see a shard. A green shard. 

My thoughts hit like a literal and metaphorical train as the end in one conclusion. Move. All stealth abandoned, I rush to my Pa’s side and check his pulse like health class taught. With a slow thrum I confirmed his continued existence, before taking my hands and shredding the bits of his uniform that were too stuck to the sickly pearls to extract. When my work was done, and the creatures around us stiff as ever, all that remained was a single external tumor on his right leg. His jeans remained as intact as I'd found him for the most part, and his over shirt had been completely coated, leaving behind a gray tank top beneath untouched. As I heaved his mostly free body to the side of the cave, one lone piece of bone separated itself from the rest, and fell to the floor. 

Raising my head at the sharp intrusion to the shuffling silence, I came to the conclusion I wasn't the only one drawn to the sudden noise. Each of the malformed, limbless things had ceased its unholy prayers, and turned their attention fully to the single bone that fell. While my breath hitched in my throat, I slowed my movement to a crawl, sliding off myself and my father against the ground seemingly not enough to alert them yet. When the movement of another of the worms caused a small avalanche of cream colored calcium, the monsters all together darted for the deluge. Twisting and engulfing any part of their presumed postmortem prey, the bundle grew in layers and size as they slid and intertwined with one another. Ideas and doubts racing through my mind, I picked a piece of what looked like a femur up from near my knelt down position, and tossed it towards the water amidst the feeding ball currently occuring. 

I was never good at any sports with a ball involved really, but this worked in my favor in this instance, as the piece landed short of the water by a few inches. Barely touching the waves ebbing to and fro from the scales bodies concealed beneath, the bone skittered to a stop with a slight ripple and splash. The ground based life forms took a moment to consult the validity of this new sound, before moving en masse and roiling around the new stimuli provided. As some slagged off of the main mass, the few unlucky enough to land in the liquid layer were quickly snatched and fought over by what gluttonous horrors awaited below the surface. 

Seeing the first light of hope, or maybe in my delusion the first action I felt confident enough to take given the bizarre situation, I rose carefully and braced myself against the wall while I gripped the handle of the shovel still strapped to my ragged leather belt. Placing my weight from the heels of my feet to the balls, I rocked my way as near as I could to the active empty buffet before me. Standing at attention within an arms length of the imminent danger, I eased the shovel from its bindings, eliciting a metallic -dink as it clashed against my belt buckle. The mass paused a bit, but continued with my unintentional warning unheeded in the slightest amidst potential food before it. Loosing the tool fully, I cocked my shoulders back and bent my knees in my best imitation of a golfer's stance. 

Slicing downward with all my might, I twisted my body up as the blade of the implement met solid flesh with a veritable slosh. Many of the cretins were damaged by the initial blow, but any that survived to some degree careened lopsidedly towards the far wall. The volleyball of veinless forms collided with rock hewn from the most solid of sediments, spewing parts of itself in a short circumference before collapsing into the water below. Residue from my actions made its home on the wall and shovel I held with dull purple murk. The presumed lifeblood of the munchkin land piranhas dripped from the cold steel I held while I reveled in the effectiveness of my actions in the moment. 

While the mysterious marine life enjoyed their unexpected all you can eat buffet, I moved myself a couple feet from the few remaining reptiles still chasing the location of the impact. Stabbing downwards I made sure to dispatch the last of the litters with haste, like one would any unsuspecting prey animal. As the flurry of motion in the pool waned off progressively, I felt the need for action drain from my body and mind, along with any coiled energy I held in tension. Crawling slowly towards the wall where my father lay up against, I curled up in the elbow of a few stones alongside him, quickly falling into the first and deepest sleep after all this time in the depths.

1oaemh1,https://i.redd.it/81ecjvswezvf1.jpeg,Why Random Acts of Kindness Still Matter in a Selfish World - TheKoinBlog.com,"We are not, most of us, in the habit of expecting kindness. Not from strangers, not without motive, and certainly not without a price. The world trains us otherwise. Transactions, obligations, reciprocal arrangements; these are the grammar of our daily lives.

And so, when something inexplicably kind occurs, when someone holds the door without checking to see if we’re worth holding it for, or pays for our coffee without leaving a name, it lands not as a routine gesture but as a gentle interruption in the hard logic of modern life.

*Random acts of kindness*. The phrase has a folksy simplicity about it, something you might see on a magnet or scribbled in the corner of a community bulletin board. But the idea itself is quietly revolutionary.

What it suggests is this: that goodness need not be earned, that compassion need not be scheduled, and that the most meaningful offerings often arrive unannounced and vanish without ceremony.

Some people roll their eyes at such things. They mistake softness for sentimentality. They assume kindness is some relic of childhood cartoons or Sunday school stories best left behind when the rent is due and the traffic is bad.

But those who dismiss kindness as naïve tend to forget that cruelty is not exactly working wonders either.

There is something defiant in being kind for no reason. It is a refusal to let the world harden you. It requires imagination to extend yourself without calculating the return. It is, in a way, a form of protest against cynicism, not loud or angry, but firm in its refusal to disappear.

Of course, kindness is not always easy. Sometimes it feels like pouring water into a cracked jar. You smile at someone and they scowl back. You give time and it is wasted. You open your heart and no one notices. But this is the risk every true act of love carries. It is the chance that what you give may never be seen the way you meant it. And yet, you give anyway.

That is what makes it beautiful. That is what makes it sacred.

A random act of kindness is not random at all in its effect. It lands in the mind of the one who receives it like a seed dropped unexpectedly into soil. Sometimes it dies there. But sometimes, in ways you will never witness, it grows into something that lifts them out of whatever darkness they were quietly drowning in. You may never know. But not knowing is part of the point. It humbles you. It frees you from the need to be congratulated. It places you in the company of those who have learned to love without audience.

Perhaps that is why the truest kindness often occurs in obscurity. A coat left on a bench. A bag of groceries quietly placed at a door. A text sent to a friend just to say “I’m thinking of you” without asking for anything in return. These are not grand gestures. They are small breaches in the fabric of a world otherwise preoccupied with itself.

And in a time where noise is cheap and attention is currency, kindness is a strange form of wealth. It cannot be hoarded. It cannot be posted for validation without reducing its worth. It is real only when it asks for nothing.

Some will say this is not practical. That the world is too broken, too corrupt, too distracted for kindness to matter. But if we are to wait for the world to become gentle before we act gently, we will be waiting forever. We are not meant to mirror the world. We are meant to disturb it, gently and without permission.

So be kind. Not because it is efficient or logical. Not because it will fix the world. Be kind because it is good. Because someone once held the door for you. Because someone once believed in you when they had no reason to. Because someone once helped you breathe easier, even for a moment.

Be kind because this world is difficult enough without us adding to the weight of it.

And if that moment of kindness vanishes into the ether, never to be traced back to you, take heart. You have done something holy. You have left the world briefly better than you found it. And sometimes, that is the most human thing we can do.

We talked on the phone for a bit before we actually got to the park, which helped calm my nerves a bit, and the conversation on the phone flowed easily.
I saw her in person and thought she was very pretty and how very little she had changed from the person I had remembered 12 years ago (we were really good friends in a small friend group). We then walked around the park, talking about various things that's happened recently, and did a bit of people watching and laughing and had a great time. We spent two hours talking and walking, and the time just flew by so much so that we were both shocked at how fast it went.

Well, it was getting dark, and she invited me back to her place, and I offered to buy food. She had mentioned she had some wine she wanted me to try. We spent the next seven or so hours still laughing and talking about everything that's happened in our lives, childhoods, and just what we expected out of life rather than what actually happened, and just what we wanted from the future. Come to find out, we share a lot of the same hobbies. We both read a lot, watch anime, crime/prison documentaries, and just both want the same things out of a relationship. Well, she got a text and said that it was someone she was currently kind of talking to but not really anymore because he didn't want a serious relationship and wanted to focus on work and didn't think she wanted to be with him because of that. She said she wasn't worried about him because of that and wanted to focus on hanging out with me but was very upfront about who it was and what not.
 It got to the point where it was 2:30 AM and getting extremely late, and I had to go if either of us wanted to get any sleep for the night. She offered me to crash at her place, but it wasn't far from my house, so I decided to drive home.

I guess I got a bit sad on the drive home and still am I suppose because after the park and hang out at her place I was planning on asking her out on an actual date because of how well it went. We hit it off so well and I felt like everything just flowed so easily and we had such great chemistry that I thought   I found someone I would be excited to hang out with again. But when I heard that towards the end it got my hopes up because I'm thinking you have people that just so willingly throw away something you want for yourself and idk I guess I feel as though I'll never find my person in life.",1,1760841839.0,venting,1,1.0,False

I want to learn English well and then take my wife to travel around the world, hoping to make more friends.

Malaysia is a very beautiful country. This is my neighbor. His house is very enviable:)

I’ve been diving into different brewing methods lately, and after trying a few options, I wanted to get some opinions from the community about which coffee makers are your go-tos. I tested out a few popular ones: drip coffee makers, pour-over setups, and French press — and here’s what I found.

Drip Coffee Makers (e.g., Breville Bambino Plus, Cuisinart DCC-3200, Moccamaster KBGV)

Drip coffee makers are still the classic choice for a reason. They’re super easy to use, just fill the basket, add water, and let the machine do its thing. If you want something reliable and convenient, Moccamaster KBGV is a top-tier option. It’s pricey, but it brews consistently great coffee, often touted for its excellent temperature control and brewing speed. If you’re not looking to spend quite that much, Cuisinart DCC-3200 offers good quality at a lower price point, though I find it’s not quite as precise as the Moccamaster.

Pour-Over Coffee Makers (e.g., Chemex, Hario V60)

For a more refined cup, pour-over is the way to go. The Chemex and Hario V60 are classic choices that let you highlight all the subtle flavors in your coffee. It’s a more hands-on process compared to drip, but I’ve found that the results are well worth the extra effort. The pour-over method gives you more control over things like water temperature and pour technique, which is perfect if you love experimenting with different flavors. The coffee is usually more vibrant and cleaner compared to drip.

French Press (e.g., Bodum Chambord, Frieling Stainless Steel Press)

If you prefer a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee, French press is definitely the way to go. I’ve been using the Bodum Chambord, and the flavor it delivers is bold and satisfying, with all the oils and natural flavors of the beans coming through. The downside is the potential for a bit of grit, since the coffee grounds aren’t filtered out as much as with drip or pour-over methods. But if you're into a thicker, more robust cup, this is a solid choice.

Final Thoughts

Each of these brewing methods brings something unique to the table. If you’re all about convenience and consistent results, drip coffee makers like the Moccamaster KBGV are hard to beat. Pour-over is great if you want a more hands-on, precise brewing experience with a bright and clean cup, while French press is perfect for those who enjoy a deep, bold flavor profile.

Which one do you prefer? Or, do you have another favorite brewing method I haven’t mentioned? Would love to hear what coffee maker you swear by!",1,1760841666.0,smartbuysforlife,0,1.0,False

Ray looked back at his log, finding a record of his night spent searching the hallways of the empty establishment for a reason to be there. The clock in the corner of the screen read three fifty-eight AM. That couldn’t be right.
 
He winced again, feeling a trickle of pain dance from his mouth to the base of his skull. The bleeding had slowed, but he could still taste the faint whisper of copper. Maybe a cup of cold coffee from one of the many dormant breakrooms would help him through. He knew he could try and call someone, maybe get home or give the tired nurses in the emergency department something to do.
 
But he was in no hurry to go back to a newly uninhabited apartment. To feel more alone than someone in a seemingly abandoned building. His hand slid into his pocket, fingers gently tracing the edge of a ring he’d once sworn to wear to the grave.
 
A small shuffling drew his attention away from his sad little life, out the large pair of windows between him and the hospital parking lot. The darkest fog to ever haunt the night whispered out a roar only inches away, sand obscuring his ability to make out even the first car only meters away. 
 
His hazel eyes squinted through the blackest night, at the sight of something shift. A shadow slipping through shadows. His mind finally pieced together the glacial movement outside into a recognizable shape, and he was surprised to find a man ambling his way. 
 
He took a step towards the sliding doors, briefly wondering if it was someone lost in the sandstorm looking for the emergency room. Ray froze when the figure lurched another step closer, and he realized he couldn’t make out any features, there was no face of any kind.
 
There was a faded burlap bag tied over the man’s head. 
 
Beside him, the antique phone trilled, and he briefly looked down and pulled the receiver up to his ear. “William Beaumont front desk, Sergeant SinClair speaking.” His eyes squinted again, searching the shadow static outside to find nothing now. Just an empty walkway swallowed up by a dirty storm. 
 
A voice on the other end spoke through the echoing hiss on the line to say, “Hey Sergeant. I’m sorry to do this but we need you on Labor and Delivery.” Before he could ask the nurse on the other end went on, “There was a stillbirth up here. We need you to help with…” The man seemed to pause, searching for the morbid clause, “process it.” 
 
Ray let the nurse know he would be right up and gently slid the handle back on the receiver. Before making his way toward the elevators he slowed to a stop before the windows, eyes searching the dry maelstrom growing stronger by the minute.
 
But there was nothing there.

Hello! 
I did a spread yesterday of a few cards where I had asked about a recent break up. I just asked ""what do I need to know about the break up?"" What do I need to know for my highest good, etc. Something generic, not trying to lead the question! 

Anyways: in order of appearance: Ace of Cups, High Priestess, Three of Cups, 5 of swords. 
I sat the deck down but then accidentally hit it on the coffee table,  and the hermit and eight of wands in reverse came out!  Then I pulled Zebra, Deer, and Otter...Magician and six of pentacles came out together, then Seven of swords and five of cups in reverse came out. 

My interpretation is that there's a lot of good energy around me right now (ace of cups, three of cups, otter energy) and an emphasis on play, friendships, lightheartedness--a time for me and to sort of frolic and be free...looking at these cards a bit longer,  I could see the ace of cups representing a dynamic or a person that is struggling to healthily express emotions..both me and/ or him..it builds up then overflows?  Ace of cups is seemingly a good card with the other pairings..but then I look at 5 of swords? It seems tense (?) .. anyways I made a decision that was ultimately hard and maybe I just need to be alone right now(?) But I don't understand the five of swords, eight of wands in reverse, or the seven of swords.. And the hermit..I suppose there isn't much of the break up or him in this at all--which is very interesting for the reading. Do you all think the cards are asking me to shift my perspective, especially with five of cups in reverse?? Does this spread look at the ""ideal"" ? Or the actual energy, etc. 

Just trying to get additional perspective since I think doing your own readings can be a bit complicated - trying not to add too much of my own personal bias. ",1,1760841633.0,Tarotpractices,2,1.0,False

1oaeiri,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oaeiri/dumped_after_two_months_how_do_i_move_on/,Dumped after two months - how do I move on?,"So I met somebody at my gym probably six months ago, and for about three and a half months we were kind of doing the poking around of just saying hi, small stares—you know how it goes. And a few months ago, I was in the lobby of my gym having a coffee and reading a book, and he came up to me. It was a wonderful interaction. He pulled up a chair, and we were just chatting for the first time for about an hour, and it was a really nice conversation. So we followed each other on social media, and he messaged me that night, and he told me it was great talking to me and that he would love to take me out when he gets back in a few days from a business trip, which he was going to go on the next day.

Even when he was on that business trip, he was still sending me a bunch of pictures and talking to me, and when he got back, we went on that date, and it was one of the best first dates I've ever been on. It was just talking, he held my hand, and we were telling stories. We walked around the city for the whole day, and I was just I was thinking to myself, like, wow, is this what happens when you don't use Bumble to meet someone? HAHA

I actually had a trip planned to my hometown, which I had made arrangements for before I met him, and it was scheduled for a month after our first date. He knew that I was leaving for two months, but we spent every day of that month together. We went to the gym and the movies. We did everything imaginably possible within that month, and I just felt like I was living in a fairy tale. He was saying how we will spend Halloween and Christmas together, and just all of those lovely lines.

So I left, and at first it was super easy. We kept in contact, and maybe about a week and a half or two weeks after I left is when the decrease started. It started very subtly where it was just a missed phone call where he said he was going to call, and he didn't, and then probably a week after that I just felt like the texts were getting slower, and I kind of called him out about it very lightly, like, ""Hey, I feel like something's changed,"" and he blamed it on me and just said, ""I feel like you're being anxious.. Nothing's wrong"", so I let it go, and then about two and a half weeks later, things were getting worse.

The texts got even slower. He stopped saying good night. It was just obvious something was wrong, so I suggested a break until I get back there in a month (at that time), and he didn't even try to stop me. He just kind of said okay. He texted me back eight hours later and said that he's really stressed with work, and it's for the best. About three days ago, after not hearing from him for a few weeks, he sent me this long message about how work is consuming him and how he really doesn't have the energy to put into our connection because he has a lot of other priorities at the moment and said he really respects me and thinks I'm this amazing and beautiful girl that will succeed at life, and just basically ended it, and it really shook me to my core.

I really can't stop crying because I'm going back to our city in one week, and I know I'm going to run into him, and it's going to destroy me because I just don't understand how it went from amazing to this.. Any advice?",1,1760841542.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

We have previously been to Secrets Akumal (preferred), Secrets Cap Cana (preferred), and Impression Moxche. I’ve seen the chart pinned to the top but I can’t download it on my phone. Here are the most important factors:

1. Absolutely must be adults only. No sharing the resort with the family resort next door. 

2. Swim out room is strongly preferred. We have always spent a lot of time in our swimout and love a swim after dinner as well. Moxche’s “private” swim out was great, but we loved Akumal’s connected just as much (and actually had more privacy there).

3. Great food. Really great food. Akumal was good. Cap Cana was good. Impression Moxche was a huge step above both. I know all AIs are like cruises and mass produce food, but Impression Moxche didn’t feel like that at all. Cielo and Seaside were so good we ate there almost every meal. The one time we went to the Moxche side to eat, we left because it was terrible. That being said, now I’m worried I’ve spoiled myself and will be disappointed with anything but Impression Moxche now.

4. We don’t care about night life or the ocean. We don’t go to shows and aren’t super social people. We do like to drink coffee down by the beach in the early mornings but swimming in the ocean isn’t important.  

As far as budget, while a little flexible, I’m trying to keep it under $7K for 2 for 6-7 nights, which knocks Impression Moxche out. I’ve checked Costco and my Capital One Travel, but frankly it’s not a huge discount compared to booking directly with the resorts. I’ve got my eye on Unico 2087 but I keep reading mixed reviews, with some saying they love it and the food is great, and others saying it’s overrated and the food is just ok.

Now that I'm 12 weeks in I wanted to share some things I've learned and honestly has me enjoying being a second time mom so much more than a first time mom. 

My first I was soooo worried about tracking everything. Ounces, wake windows, hours slept, etc. My second, there is no time and honestly I can't imagine trying. We just go off his vibes and cues and honestly I wish I had the confidence to do it the first time. Are days perfect? No 

Get. Out. Of. The. House. While sometimes getting out the door leaves me sweaty and questioning my sanity. Every time it's worth it. Granted both my boys do well in the car but they have to, we live 30 min from nearest large town and where our church is. But I'm not afraid of outings or meltdowns if they happen. Sometimes we just do our usual walk around town. Sometimes we go to the botanical gardens or grocery shop. Today we ventured to my hometown an hour and 15 min away. Bumped up nap time and we're gone from 10 am - 8:30 pm. It was wonderful. If I was a first time mom I would have been soooo anxious (also Lexapro has def helped this time around)

I've just accepted (and I love it) that this is my season of mom and wife era. I stay home and I treat it like my career and primary focus. Yes I try to workout and take care of me but this season is for my boys. The more I've focused on that and less on what about me time, the happier I've become and truly loved the simplicity of the days or maybe the monotony. 

I was SO worried about loving both of having time for both. My second son is pure joy. He's truly happy to be here. My first was harder in many ways and I wonder if I just made it harder or if he was - if that makes sense. But man I love both of my kids so much and I try to take time each week just with them. Sometimes my oldest just runs to the store with me and I'll take the baby for coffee with a friend. I've figured out how to manage it and get the quality time. 

Also, I have to say I'm really lucky to be blessed with a hands on and supportive husband. Our family is first. We each have a hobby but we prioritize our children and our relationship and do spend a lot of time together and obviously that has made parenting better and easier on me which I do not take for granted. 

All that to say, for those fretting and scared of the age gap, I'm not going to lie and say it's easy but I'm not sure parenting ever is. And this is the only age gap I know and will ever know so it's been okay. It's all a season and I think just go all in. I had all the apprehension of how I'd handle x,y,z scenario and eventually you just do or you have to and you become more and more confident in your parenting abilities. We've got this.

I bolted out of class and made a beeline for the bathroom. Just as I reached the door, Chad—yes, *that* Chad, the guy who thinks he owns the hallway—was standing there like a security guard.

“Bathroom’s closed,” he said, smirking.

I was doing the potty dance like my life depended on it. “Dude, move. I’m not kidding.”

Mid-shove, I felt it. The betrayal. My body gave up. I froze. Chad stopped. Everyone stopped. And then came the *squelch*. I had officially lost the fight—and not just the one with Chad.

The big question is where I could have our meetings at, and I'd love to seek some recommendations for possible meeting spots.

I haven't set a day/time/frequency yet for meetings, but it would heavily depend on where I could host. Some preferences for a place:
-In or near Reston, Herndon, Vienna, Fairfax (city), or Chantilly 
-Can hold 10-15 people
-Available in the evenings (6-9 pm) or weekends 
-If this is a coffee shop/bar/restaurant, it doesn't need to have a separate room, but quiet enough to be able to hear one another.
-Low or no-cost to host (or I could ask members to at least buy something from the hosting place).

Life's been a bit of a mess if I'm honest. It's thrown plenty my way, but I'm still here. Slightly battered and mildly traumatised but still here.

A Spiritual Guide to Making Mistakes

by ALIBI

-----

## Introduction: The Sacred Mess

You’ve dropped your coffee for the third time this week. You forgot an important meeting. You said the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment. Again. You might be wondering: what’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get anything right?

But what if nothing is wrong with you at all? What if these moments of messiness are actually messages—spiritual breadcrumbs leading you toward something deeper, truer, and more aligned with who you’re meant to be?

This book explores a radically different perspective on mistakes, one that sees them not as failures but as invitations. Each stumble, each forgotten task, each clumsy moment might be your soul’s way of getting your attention, asking you to pause, listen, and recalibrate.

The spiritual traditions of the world have long recognized that our outer chaos often reflects an inner misalignment. When we’re constantly messing up, we’re not broken—we’re being called to wake up.

-----

## Chapter 1: Your Soul Needs You to Slow Down

### The Tyranny of Speed

We live in a world that worships speed. Faster responses, quicker results, immediate gratification. We’ve learned to treat our lives like a race we must win, cramming more tasks into less time, multitasking ourselves into a frenzy of partial attention and scattered energy.

But your soul doesn’t operate on deadlines. It moves at the pace of seasons, of breath, of genuine presence. When you’re racing through life, you disconnect from the wisdom of your body and the quiet whispers of your intuition. You become a stranger to yourself.

### Mistakes as Messengers

The dropped keys, the forgotten appointments, the words that come out all wrong—these aren’t random inconveniences. They’re your soul tapping you on the shoulder, trying to get your attention. Each mistake is a small rebellion against the tyranny of speed, a forced pause in the endless rush.

Think of it this way: when a computer gets overloaded, it freezes or crashes. Your mistakes might be your system’s way of forcing a restart, creating the pause you haven’t allowed yourself to take voluntarily.

### The Practice of Presence

Living mindfully means inhabiting your body and your moment fully. It means feeling your feet on the ground as you walk, tasting your food as you eat, listening completely when someone speaks. When you’re truly present, mistakes often dissolve because you’re paying attention to what you’re actually doing rather than thinking three steps ahead or ruminating on what happened yesterday.

Try this: For one full day, move at half your usual speed. Notice how this changes not just your error rate but the quality of your experience. Notice what you see, hear, and feel when you’re not rushing past your own life.

-----

## Chapter 2: The Root of the Matter—Understanding Your Foundation

### The Root Chakra: Your Energetic Foundation

In many spiritual traditions, the root chakra (Muladhara) represents our foundation—our sense of safety, security, and groundedness in the physical world. Located at the base of the spine, it’s our energetic root system, connecting us to the earth and to the stability we need to function in daily life.

When this energy center is balanced, you feel secure, present, and capable. You move through the world with confidence and steadiness. But when it’s blocked or imbalanced, you might feel scattered, anxious, and yes—clumsy.

### Signs of Imbalance

Physical clumsiness is often a manifestation of spiritual and emotional ungroundedness. If you’re constantly tripping, dropping things, or bumping into objects, your root chakra might be calling for attention. Other signs include:

- Financial anxiety or instability
- Feeling disconnected from your body
- Difficulty making decisions
- Constant worry about basic needs
- Feeling like you don’t belong anywhere
- Physical restlessness or inability to sit still

### The Sources of Instability

Root chakra imbalances often arise from real-world instabilities. Perhaps your job feels uncertain, your relationship is rocky, or you’re facing housing insecurity. Maybe you’ve recently moved or experienced a significant loss. These external circumstances create internal turbulence that manifests as physical awkwardness and mental fog.

Childhood experiences also play a role. If your early years were marked by instability, neglect, or trauma, your root chakra might bear those scars, making you more vulnerable to feeling ungrounded during times of stress.

### Restoring Your Foundation

Healing the root chakra involves both practical and spiritual work:

**Physical grounding practices**: Walk barefoot on grass or soil. Garden. Work with clay or earth. These activities literally reconnect you with the ground beneath your feet.

**Body awareness**: Yoga poses like Mountain Pose, Warrior I, or Child’s Pose help you feel your connection to the earth. Any practice that brings awareness to your lower body and legs strengthens your energetic foundation.

**Create stability**: Address practical concerns where possible. Create a budget if finances are chaotic. Establish routines that provide structure. Make your living space feel safe and nurturing.

**Red energy**: The root chakra is associated with the color red. Wear red, eat red foods (beets, strawberries, red peppers), or visualize red light at the base of your spine during meditation.

## Chapter 3: The Burden of Mental and Emotional Overload

### When Your Cup Overflows

Imagine your mind as a cup. Every worry, every responsibility, every unprocessed emotion adds more liquid to that cup. Eventually, it overflows. When this happens, there’s simply no room for the ordinary tasks of living. You forget things not because you’re careless but because your mental and emotional capacity is maxed out.

### The Exhausted Mind

Mental exhaustion doesn’t just make you tired—it makes you incompetent. Your brain, overwhelmed and depleted, starts dropping balls. You can’t focus because your attention is already fully occupied by the background noise of stress, anxiety, and unprocessed emotions.

Research shows that chronic stress actually impairs the prefrontal cortex—the part of your brain responsible for executive function, decision-making, and impulse control. In other words, when you’re constantly stressed, your brain literally can’t perform the functions that prevent mistakes.

### The Physical Manifestation

Your body keeps the score. Emotional and mental overload doesn’t just live in your head—it shows up in your actions. Dropped dishes, forgotten appointments, and misplaced keys are your body’s way of saying “I can’t carry this anymore.”

Each mistake is a message: you’re carrying too much. Something needs to be released, processed, or resolved before you can function normally again.

### The Path to Clarity

**Empty the cup regularly**: Just as you wouldn’t drink from an overflowing cup, you can’t function well with an overloaded mind. Create daily practices that help you process and release:

- Journal to externalize thoughts and feelings
- Talk to a trusted friend or therapist
- Engage in vigorous exercise to release stored tension
- Cry when you need to—tears are the body’s release valve

**Single-tasking**: Multitasking is a myth. What we call multitasking is actually rapid task-switching, and it depletes mental resources quickly. Practice doing one thing at a time with your full attention.

**Rest as a spiritual practice**: In our productivity-obsessed culture, rest feels like failure. But rest is when your nervous system resets, when your mind processes and consolidates information, when your body heals. Sleep, nap, and simply sit without agenda. This isn’t laziness—it’s necessary maintenance.

**Boundaries**: Learn to say no. Every yes to something is a no to something else—often your own wellbeing. Protecting your energy isn’t selfish; it’s self-preservation.

-----

## Chapter 4: When Opposition Means You’re on the Right Path

### The Resistance Principle

There’s a curious spiritual paradox: the closer you get to your true purpose, the more obstacles you might encounter. This isn’t punishment or bad luck—it’s a sign that you’re making progress, that you’re stepping into territory that matters, that you’re threatening the status quo of your old life.

Steven Pressfield calls this “Resistance” in his book *The War of Art*. It’s that force that shows up precisely when you’re about to do something meaningful, something that will help you grow or serve others. It manifests as procrastination, self-doubt, conflict, or yes—a sudden increase in mistakes and mishaps.

### Testing Your Commitment

Spiritual opposition serves as a filter. It asks: How much do you want this? Are you willing to persist when things get difficult? Many people turn back at the first sign of resistance, interpreting obstacles as signs they’re on the wrong path. But often, the opposite is true.

Think of it like exercising. The resistance of the weights is what builds muscle. Without resistance, there’s no growth. The spiritual journey works the same way. The challenges you face when pursuing your purpose aren’t roadblocks—they’re the very means of your strengthening.

### Distinguishing Resistance from Wrong Direction

How do you know if obstacles mean you should push through or change course? Here are some distinctions:

**Push through when**:

- You feel fear but also deep conviction
- The goal aligns with your values and serves others
- You’re learning and growing despite the difficulty
- There’s a sense of meaning in the struggle
- You feel called, even if you feel inadequate

**Change course when**:

- You feel constant dread with no underlying passion
- You’re causing harm to yourself or others
- You’ve lost sight of why this mattered
- Your body is breaking down (not just tired, but chronically ill)
- You’re pursuing someone else’s dream, not your own

### Embracing the Hero’s Journey

Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey describes a pattern found in myths worldwide: the hero receives a call, faces challenges and opposition, descends into darkness, and emerges transformed with gifts to share. Your life follows this same pattern.

The mistakes and mishaps you’re experiencing might be part of your descent, the difficult middle section where everything seems to go wrong. This is exactly where the hero wants to give up and go home. But it’s also where the transformation happens.

Your opposition is proof that you’re on a journey worth taking.

-----

## Chapter 5: The Humbling of the Ego

### The Illusion of Self-Sufficiency

The ego loves to believe it has everything under control. It tells you that you should be able to handle everything independently, that asking for help is weakness, that you should be perfect and strong and invulnerable. This is, of course, completely unsustainable.

When you keep messing up despite your best efforts, the ego’s illusion crumbles. You’re forced to confront the truth: you’re human, limited, and in need of grace—both from yourself and from something greater than yourself.

### The Gift in Humiliation

The word “humility” shares a root with “humus”—earth, soil, ground. To be humbled is to be brought back down to earth, to remember that you’re made of dust and to dust you shall return. This isn’t meant to degrade you but to free you from the exhausting burden of trying to be godlike.

Mistakes humiliate the ego, but they nourish the soul. Each time you fail and the world doesn’t end, you learn that you’re more than your performance. You discover that your worth isn’t determined by your perfection but exists independent of your achievements.

### Learning Dependence

Western culture celebrates independence as the highest virtue. But every spiritual tradition recognizes that true strength involves acknowledging our dependence—on each other, on nature, on the divine. We’re not meant to do life alone.

When mistakes force you to ask for help, accept support, or admit you don’t have all the answers, you’re practicing a deeper form of strength. You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t weakness—it’s the doorway to connection and grace.

### Releasing Control

The need to control everything comes from fear. If you can just manage every variable, plan for every contingency, and execute everything perfectly, then you’ll be safe. But life is fundamentally uncontrollable, and the attempt to control it creates immense suffering.

Constantly dropping and breaking things can be the universe’s way of showing you that your grip is too tight. Some things are meant to fall. Some plans are meant to change. Some outcomes are meant to surprise you. Learning to let go—of perfection, of control, of outcomes—is one of life’s most important spiritual lessons.

-----

## Chapter 6: The Universe’s Call for Change

### When the Old Must Break

There’s a Japanese art form called kintsugi, where broken pottery is repaired with gold, making the breaks part of the object’s beauty and history. The philosophy recognizes that breakage and repair are part of an object’s story, not something to hide but to highlight.

Your life sometimes requires the same process. Things must break before they can be repaired and made more beautiful. The mistakes you’re making might be the breaking—uncomfortable, messy, but necessary for what comes next.

### Reading the Signs

Repeated mishaps can be symbolic messages pointing you toward necessary transformation. Pay attention to what keeps breaking or going wrong:

- Breaking dishes or glasses might signal a need to release old patterns or relationships
- Losing things could indicate you’re holding too tightly to the past
- Technology malfunctions might suggest you need to disconnect and return to simpler ways
- Spilling water could represent emotional overflow needing expression
- Dropping food might mean you’re not nourishing yourself properly

These aren’t superstitions but invitations to reflection. What might these patterns be trying to tell you about what needs to change?

### Releasing What No Longer Serves

We often cling to jobs, relationships, beliefs, and identities long after they’ve stopped serving our growth. We stay in the known discomfort rather than risk the unknown possibility. But sometimes life has to create such chaos in the old that we have no choice but to reach for something new.

Ask yourself: What am I holding onto that’s already broken? What part of my life is ready to be released? What am I afraid to let go of, even though it’s weighing me down?

### The Phoenix Process

The mythical phoenix must burn completely before it can rise from the ashes. The caterpillar must dissolve into formless goo before it can become a butterfly. Some transformations require complete dissolution of the old form.

If your life feels like it’s falling apart, you might be in a phoenix moment. Everything you knew, everything you counted on, everything you thought you were—it’s all burning away. This is terrifying, but it’s also sacred. The dissolution is making room for a truer version of you to emerge.

### Building the New

Once you’ve released what no longer serves, you have space to build something new. But build differently this time. Build with the wisdom earned through your mistakes. Build with more flexibility, more authenticity, more alignment with your true values.

Your mistakes have refined you, stripped away the false, and revealed what truly matters. Use this clarity to create a life that feels like home to your soul.

-----

## Chapter 7: The Practice of Spiritual Response

### Forgiveness: The Foundation of Freedom

The first and most crucial spiritual response to your mistakes is forgiveness—specifically, self-forgiveness. You must free yourself from the prison of self-blame, that voice that says you’re fundamentally flawed, that you should be better, that you’re not enough.

Forgiveness doesn’t mean pretending the mistakes didn’t happen or that they didn’t have consequences. It means accepting that you’re human, that you did the best you could with what you knew, and that you deserve compassion rather than condemnation.

**A forgiveness practice**: Place your hand on your heart and say, “I forgive myself for not being perfect. I forgive myself for my mistakes. I release myself from shame and blame. I am learning, growing, and doing my best.”

Repeat this daily, especially when you mess up. Over time, you’ll internalize a new voice—one of kindness rather than criticism.

### Grounding and Alignment Practices

When you’re feeling scattered and mistake-prone, grounding practices help restore your sense of stability and presence.

**Earthing**: Walk barefoot on natural ground—grass, sand, soil. Research shows this literally balances your body’s electrical charge and reduces inflammation and stress.

**Tree meditation**: Stand or sit with your back against a tree. Feel its solidity, its rootedness, its patient presence. Imagine roots growing from your body deep into the earth, anchoring and stabilizing you.

**Body scan**: Lie down and slowly move your attention through your body from toes to head. Notice any tension, numbness, or discomfort without judgment. This practice reconnects you with physical reality and brings you out of mental chaos.

**Breath work**: Simple breathing practices calm the nervous system and bring you into the present moment. Try box breathing: inhale for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four, hold for four. Repeat for several minutes.

**Nature immersion**: Spend time in natural settings without agenda. Sit by water, walk in woods, watch clouds. Nature has a way of resetting our internal rhythms and reminding us of larger patterns and cycles.

### Prayer and Meditation

Whether you relate to God, the Universe, Higher Self, or simply the mysterious intelligence that animates all life, turning to something greater than your ego is profoundly healing.

**Prayer for guidance**: “Help me understand what these mistakes are trying to teach me. Show me what I need to see, change what needs changing, and give me the strength and wisdom to walk this path.”

**Confession and release**: Honestly acknowledge your shortcomings, not to grovel but to release the burden of carrying them alone. “I’m struggling. I keep making mistakes. I feel inadequate. I need help.”

**Meditation for clarity**: Sit quietly and ask, “What do I need to know right now?” Then listen. Not for a booming voice, but for the quiet knowing that arises when you create space for it.

**Gratitude practice**: Even in the midst of chaos, especially then, find things to appreciate. Gratitude shifts your perspective from what’s wrong to what’s working, from scarcity to abundance. It doesn’t deny problems but refuses to let them define your entire reality.

### Seeking Growth, Not Perfection

Perfectionism is a spiritual trap. It sets an impossible standard that ensures you’ll always feel inadequate, always be striving, never be enough. The spiritual path isn’t about becoming perfect—it’s about becoming more fully yourself, which includes your flaws, your limitations, your humanity.

**Reframe mistakes as data**: Each mistake provides information. What can you learn? What would you do differently next time? What’s this teaching you about yourself or your situation? When mistakes become teachers rather than failures, they lose their power to shame you.

**Embrace the beginner’s mind**: In Zen Buddhism, “beginner’s mind” refers to approaching life with openness and curiosity, without preconceptions. When you’re willing to be a beginner, to not know, to make the mistakes that come with learning, you open yourself to genuine growth.

**Progress, not perfection**: The goal is to be slightly better today than yesterday, slightly wiser this year than last. Not perfect, not superior to others, just incrementally growing. This sustainable approach honors your humanity while still moving you forward.

### The Power of Laughter

Taking yourself too seriously is exhausting. It makes every mistake a catastrophe, every misstep a referendum on your worth. But when you can laugh at yourself—genuinely, kindly—you rob mistakes of their power to devastate you.

Humor creates space between you and your errors. You’re not your mistakes; you’re the awareness observing them, and that awareness can find them amusing rather than tragic.

**Develop your inner comedian**: When you mess up, try narrating it as if you’re a character in a sitcom. The exaggeration and distance this creates can help you see the humor in the situation.

**Share your blunders**: Perfection isolates; vulnerability connects. When you share your mistakes with others, you usually discover they have similar stories. Laughter together creates bonds and reminds you that everyone struggles.

**Find the absurd**: Life is genuinely absurd sometimes. The same person who can ponder the mysteries of existence can also walk into a glass door. This contradiction is hilarious if you let it be.

-----

## Chapter 8: Integration—Living with Compassionate Awareness

### The Ongoing Practice

Spiritual growth isn’t a destination you reach and then you’re done. It’s an ongoing practice, a daily choice to bring consciousness and compassion to your life. You’ll have periods of clarity and periods of chaos, times when you feel aligned and times when you feel like a disaster.

This is normal. This is the rhythm of growth. The key is developing the awareness to notice where you are and the compassion to be okay with it.

### When Mistakes Happen Again

Because they will. You’ll think you’ve learned the lesson, made the shift, resolved the issue—and then you’ll find yourself making similar mistakes again. This doesn’t mean you’ve failed or learned nothing. It means you’re human and growth is spiral, not linear.

Each time you encounter a familiar mistake, you meet it from a slightly different place. You have more awareness, more tools, more perspective. The spiral brings you back to similar territory but at a higher level of understanding.

Be patient with yourself. Be patient with the process. Transformation takes time.

### Signs of Progress

How do you know if this spiritual approach is working? Look for these signs:

- You recover more quickly from mistakes
- Your inner critic’s voice gets quieter or kinder
- You feel more grounded even during chaos
- You can laugh at yourself more easily
- You’re less afraid of making mistakes
- You notice patterns more quickly
- You feel more connected to something larger than yourself
- You treat yourself and others with more compassion

These shifts might be subtle, but they’re profound. They indicate that you’re moving from a place of fear and shame to one of trust and self-acceptance.

### Your Unique Path

The spiritual interpretations and practices in this book are offerings, not prescriptions. Take what resonates, leave what doesn’t, and adapt what you use to fit your own beliefs and circumstances. Your spiritual path is yours alone.

Maybe you resonate with chakras and energy work. Maybe you prefer prayer and scripture. Maybe you find your spirituality in nature, in relationships, in art, or in silence. Whatever your path, the core message remains: your mistakes are not evidence of your inadequacy but invitations to deeper awareness, greater alignment, and more authentic living.

### The Invitation

Your mistakes are knocking at your door, trying to tell you something. Will you answer? Will you listen to what they’re trying to teach you about slowing down, finding balance, releasing control, or changing direction?

The choice is yours. You can continue to berate yourself, to see your errors as proof of your unworthiness. Or you can begin to see them as sacred messengers, as uncomfortable gifts wrapped in frustration and embarrassment but containing exactly the lesson you need right now.

The spiritual path isn’t about transcending your humanity—it’s about embracing it fully, mistakes and all. It’s about bringing consciousness and compassion to every part of your life, even (especially) the parts that feel most broken.

You are not broken. You are being broken open. And what’s emerging is more authentic, more compassionate, and more aligned with your deepest truth than what came before.

-----

## Conclusion: The Beauty of Being Human

We began this book with a question: What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get anything right?

Now, perhaps, you can see that these were the wrong questions. The right question is: What are my mistakes trying to teach me?

Being human means being imperfect. It means making mistakes, falling down, getting lost, breaking things, and having to start over. But it also means learning, growing, connecting, forgiving, and becoming more fully yourself with each passing day.

Your mistakes are not obstacles to your spiritual journey—they are the journey. Each error is an opportunity to practice self-compassion, to release control, to ask for help, to humble your ego, and to align more closely with your authentic path.

You are not failing at life. You are learning to be human, which is the hardest and most sacred thing any of us will ever do.

So the next time you drop your coffee, forget an important task, or say the wrong thing at the wrong time, take a breath. Smile if you can. And ask yourself: What is this trying to teach me? What is my soul asking me to notice?

Then listen. Really listen. The answer might surprise you, challenge you, or comfort you. But it will be exactly what you need to hear.

Your mistakes are speaking. It’s time to listen.

## Acknowledgments

To every person who has ever felt like a walking disaster, who has wondered what’s wrong with them, who has beaten themselves up over mistakes big and small—this book is for you. Your struggles are not signs of inadequacy but of humanity, and your willingness to keep going despite them is nothing short of heroic.

May you be gentle with yourself.
May you find meaning in your mistakes.
May you remember that you are enough, exactly as you are.

I miss that instant relief for morning anxiety, its so difficult to go through life when anything that ever bothers me I could just stop that feeling with a few shots.

10 months ago I was crawling out of a few months long bender. I was getting out of the military, staying at an old friend from the services house. Drank 20+ beers and managed to piss on everything except the toilet bowl, got kicked out by my buddy at 3am for that. Drove hammered to the base to check out. Drank more in the bathroom on base and went to the airport. Cutoff came from the stewardess as soon as I asked for a mini, they saw me stumble my way on.

I'd like to say I got sober after that but I came home and drank all day, every day for a few weeks. I didn't eat for a week, if I wasn't drinking I was sleeping 14 or more hours. Hiding handles of vodka in my attic, telling my wife that I must be sick from my trip. 

I threw up coffee ground looking shit. No health care and I didn't start my new job for a few weeks. I tapered. Tapered down from over a liter of vodka to what I thought would help me not WD. The hallucinations and sweats were much stronger that time. 4 days of misery and puking bile with a mix of old and new blood. Survived just fine I'm lucky to be young and dumb I suppose.

It's amazing that I can remember how desperate I felt to just stop or die during that last bender. And all I want is a fucking drink.

Life's been a bit of a mess if I'm honest. It's thrown plenty my way, but I'm still here. Slightly battered and mildly traumatised but still here. I deal with most things through dark humour and self-deprecation. It's a coping mechanism but at least it's entertaining (for me) for others it can make them quietly uncomfortable. 

I'm 26year old dad from the UK , An introvert with the exception of few days scattered throughout the year where I'm an extrovert. 

Books, games, movies and tv shows, art - that’s my comfort. I do enjoy being out in nature though, especially if there's coffee involved and the world is still quiet. 

Looking to meet people who are up for honest chats, whether it's deep talks about life and existence or completely pointless stuff like talking about if ducks can sneeze - can they? 

If you're kind, at least alittle emotionally aware, and have a twisted sense of humour, we'll probably get on.
If you're into alt & nerdy things, silly conversations, and don't mind a bit of dark humour mixed with actual sincerity, send a message or comment for a dm :)

How's that for an introduction?

I value tidiness and organization. Things like cleaning up after yourself, putting things back where they were found, and being proactive (e.g. loading/emptying the dishwasher, changing the roll of toilet paper, changing the trash bag, etc) are no-brainers to me. I also value communication and honesty. Difficult conversations are never fun, but they occasionally need to happen, so my attitude is to face them head-on with a level head and focus on finding a solution.

I strive to live a small, quiet life. Stress is a natural part of life, so I deal with it with as much grace as possible, but I try to limit stressors in my life. I'm frugal with my money, I don't often go to events with large crowds, I use weekends largely to relax and recharge, and I plan ahead as much as possible.

I love cooking. I meal prep my lunches for the week, and I cook most of my dinners. I eat out once or twice a week to treat myself. I try to balance eating delicious food with making healthy decisions. I start my days with oatmeal, fruit, eggs, coffee and water, and drink a lot of water and tea throughout the rest of the day.

Speaking of health, I have a heart condition. I have a pacemaker-defibrillator, but I live a mostly normal life. I have check ups every three months, and I take whatever my doctor says seriously. I also have ADHD and struggle with anxiety, but treatment has helped immeasurably. I'm not currently in therapy, but I did it regularly for four years and it helped me grow and mature into who I am today.

I'm sex positive, I'm 420 friendly, and I'm a firm believer in body autonomy. I'm very left leaning and I vote, but I'm not a fan of any US political parties. I welcome calm, polite discourse, but I'm not interested in arguing with anyone. I come from a long line of hotheads, and I've worked long and hard to control my anger, and sometimes that means walking away from a conversation that feels neither productive nor cordial.

I love animals, often more than people. My voice automatically goes up several octaves when I talk to any animal for any reason. (Even if I was pleading with a bear or mountain lion not to kill me, I'd probably do it in a silly voice.) I have a four-year-old female tabby named Chani, and I spoil the fuck out of her whenever I can. She's a brat, but she's my baby and I adore her.

I love art. Movies, music, paintings, sculptures…you name it. I'm very protective of artists and their freedom to express themselves, even at the expense of their fans’ sensibilities. I believe consumerism is the enemy of artistic expression, and that it has created a lot of entitled whiners who criticize because they can't create. You’ll never hear me say something sucks or is bad, or that an artist sold out or fell off. There's art I like and art that's not for me.

I've thought a lot about why I want a partner, and here's what I've come up with… Of course I want the affection, the company, and the stability, but there's much more to it. My ideal version of a relationship is one where we are equals who trust and love each other the way best friends do. I tend to be at my best when I'm with people I love, and I derive strength from being devoted to a loved one's happiness. Companionship is a gift to be cherished.",2,1760840092.0,cf4cf,0,0.67,False

1oadzzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/1oadzzw/eoe_and_chest_pains_adhd_ibs_possible/,"EoE and chest pains, ADHD, IBS- possible comorbidities","Hi, sorry this is possibly going to be a long and confusing post. 

TL;DR: Looking for loved experiences or suggestions for myself relating to possible comorbid conditions or if it's all been EoE all along, and also if I should get my kids tested for EoE.

My history:
I had my first colonoscopy/ endoscopy in 2015 age 23 after awful reflux and gastro symptoms and ruling out other things, and a family history of bowel cancer. Esophagus was fine then aside from signs of reflux but not sure if they biopsied for EoE or not. At that time I was having acid bubble up/ vomiting acid like every 20 mins, and also classic IBS symptoms. Colonoscopy found 3 polyps, removed, not of concerning type. Diagnosed with IBS, doctor said, ""we call it IBS when there's inflammation but we can't find a specific cause"" so I was told to do the FODMAP diet and recommended to return 2020. I did FODMAP and found I had to limit wheat and dairy (e.g. I could drink milk in a coffee, but a milkshake would be too much). Symptoms greatly improved, or so I thought. I would often still get ""reflux"" but not always painful. Constant cough and post-nasal drop type thing. Constant sensitive stomach, but just so much better than before that I wasn't worried. I once went to a GP because I felt after eating fast food that my throat was closing up but I could still breathe, and she told me, ""this is just what reflux feels like"" so I wasn't worried. Only experienced that proper throat closing feeling like twice and it wasn't associated with pain.

For the rescope I was meant to get in 2020- Covid hit, so I couldn't do it. 2021- pregnant, couldn't do it. 2022- GP put me on the public wait-list to get it done, QLD Health was awful and wouldn't allow reschedules so I got put back on the wait-list all over again and was finally given another colonoscopy and endoscopy in August 2024. This showed inflammation and a benign tumor/ growth in my oesophagus but they just said it was from bad acid reflux over years. 5 polyps removed, recommended for annual colonscopies. 

I was diagnosed with EoE in January after scopes showed high eosinophils, and I've been doing 6FED since. After the scope in August showed significant reflux signs I was prescribed a PPI (rabeprazole) and was told to take daily and re-scope, which I did in November but then once they confirmed EoE they said I don't need to take it anymore and just to do 6FED. I'm in Australia and it seems from reading a lot of posts in here that things are managed a little differently in each country as I've not even been told about medications let alone given them, and have been told to do 6FED off the bat.

I successfully eliminated triggers and my scope showed no eosinophils after 4 months on 6FED. I then successfully reintroduced seafood and re-scoped, clear again. My gastro doctor told me to reintroduce eggs and nuts because they're both less likely, and I've been doing so for about a month now, next scope in 6 weeks time. Since reintroducing, I haven't noticed any esophagus symptoms but my IBS symptoms are much worse with pain, bloating, nausea, urgency for the toilet, etc. My GI doctor told me EoE only affects the oesophagus though not the stomach.

Side quest: since about 15/16 I've been having episodes of tachycardia and sharp chest pain lasting 4-6 hours. ECG's, heart ultrasound, blood tests all fine. Cardiologist said my heart is fine, I just need to eat more salt. Prescribed a medication for the low blood pressure (usually sits 70/110 - 75/115 range) to help with general dizziness I get when standing etc, and that was it. My GP then told me not to take the medication as it will likely worsen my persistent tachycardia, and just keep eating more salt and drinking lots of water.  The pain is sometimes accompanied by tingling in fingers and toes, not always. The pain is VERY sharp like a knife, and hurts worse when I move or breathe, so the aftermath is like days of stiffness and headaches because my back and neck muscles lock in to prevent me moving. It doesn't always occur directly after eating or in high stress times (usually actually in low stress) and doesn't appear to be cardiac. This happened last week and the ED Nurse said ""I can't really diagnose but with your history I'd imagine it could be related to your oesophagus, like a spasm"". In case it was GERD/ reflux related pain, which was previously hypothesized, I had taken my PPI and 4 Mylanta antacids, which did not help and pain actually worsened over the next 3 hours. In the past, am ED doctor diagnosed me with ""Benign Chest Wall Cavity Pain"" which he said, ""we don't know what causes it, but it happens to tall young females and it's harmless"". I am still tall and female, but aged 33 not really in the ""young"" category any more, and it's still happening, but this week was the first time it's happened this year.

So my questions are (based on your lived experiences, not expecting diagnosis from the internet):

1) has anyone with EoE also experienced these sharp chest pains before, and if so were they linked to EoE?

2)could the IBS symptoms be from an EoE trigger, or do you guys only get upper GI symptoms from trigger foods? Could I have an intolerance to a food causing IBS, but be clear for that food from EoE?

3)my GI doctor, cardiologist, GP all don't talk to each other, just read notes and seem to have different opinions. Is there a specialist that looks at the whole picture, who has helped, or is a GI doctor still my best bet at managing this? If there's a specialist, any recommendations in Brisbane, Australia or at least a specialist type?

4) I also have ADHD- just wondering if this is often comorbid for a lot of you?

5) my GI doctor said, ""with results like this, I'm shocked you don't have asthma or eczema""- I do have bad hayfever and need Zyrtec daily just to function. I've had pneumonia twice and chest infections a lot, could this have been asthma in disguise, or am I reaching? Could I have actual asthma and not know? I have sensitive skin but not eczema as far as I'm aware.

6) my son has asthma (technically ""pre-school wheeze"" at his age, but essentially the same thing and pretty serious needing hospitalisation 4 times) and eczema. He's 4. His dentist just told me last week to cut gluten, dairy and soy from his diet (she wouldn't know about my EoE) to help with his mouth breathing as she thinks he has an intolerance causing nasal congestion and making him mouth breathe (he's already had tonsils out, grommets in and the ENT said adenoids were fine when he went in to remove so he left them). Could this be a different manifestation of EoE in a child? He was always a ""vomit-y baby"" and has always had a sensitive gag reflex and will eat a full meal, vomit due to triggering it, then be hungry and eat another full meal. She also said he might have a tongue tie and also recommended myofascial therapy. I've booked a GP appointment for him, but given that it took 32 years of symptoms for me to be diagnosed I don't hold out much hope that concerns will be taken seriously, and want to go in prepared to ask for tests or referrals, but not sure where to start. 

7) did anyone find any relationship between trigger foods for EoE, and behaviour (e.g. ADHD- like symptoms)? My daughter doesn't have the same ENT issues as my son, but she was diagnosed with ADHD age 3 and is going through ASD assessment, and some ""mum's groups"" recommend cutting dairy and gluten to help manage symptoms as if it's a miracle cure, and now I'm curious if it could just be a weird manifestation of EoE as a root cause? Or is that just some crunchy mum rabbit hole I don't want to go down lol.

I feel like I keep repeating the same mistake.,"I met this guy through my DMs before Covid, around April 2019. We started chatting, talking on the phone, and everything seemed to click. A few weeks later we met up for coffee and it actually went really well. He asked to see me again and I said sure.

He gave me his address and told me to pick him up. As I was driving there, about five minutes away, I saw him standing outside flagging me down. I stopped, he got into my car, and I figured we’d head out somewhere since it was around 6 p.m. But he was wearing pajamas, slides, and a t-shirt.

So I asked what the plan was, and he said, “No plan, I just wanted to see you.” I asked if he wanted to grab food, and he said his mom made his favorites and he was going to eat that later. I tried to keep things going and suggested this new shake place that had just opened. He said he didn’t know it and parking was tight, so I could just go in and grab him something I thought he’d like. At that point I didn’t even know what to say.

I suggested we drive downtown instead. After a while, I said I was hungry and wanted to go through a drive-thru. He said he was a little hungry too. We grabbed food and ate in the parking lot. When we were done, I said it was getting late and I should head home.

Later, he texted me saying, “Let’s plan an official date. Dinner and a movie.” I thought, okay, maybe he’s actually interested this time.

We planned for the following Saturday. I confirmed with him the night before, got all dressed up, and wore a new dress. This was my first date after my five-year divorce, and I was honestly excited. I even took selfies to send to my friend.

I texted him the day of to confirm and said I’d get the tickets through the app. No response. I still went to the theater thinking maybe he’d show up. He never did. No call, no text. Nothing.

Three weeks later, he messages saying he was caught up with something and wants to catch up. I told him how messed up it was that he ghosted me and stopped talking to him after that.

Fast forward to 2025. Out of nowhere, he messages me again. He asked how I’ve been and if I was dating anyone. I said no, not at the moment. Then he said, “Let’s grab a coffee one day.” And stupidly, I said yes.

We planned to meet at a café near my place. I got ready and was waiting for him there when he messaged saying he was running an hour late because he was cleaning his gun (he’s in law enforcement). I told him I couldn’t wait because I had to pick up my kids from the babysitter.

Didn’t hear from him again until two weeks later. He asked if I could do lunch. I said I’d check with my boss and maybe take a longer lunch. I made a reservation for 11:45 since I had a meeting at 1:30. Then he texted asking if we could do 1 instead. I said no, I already booked it. He replied, “You always do this.” Like, what? I don’t own the business — I can’t just take lunch whenever I want.

Didn’t hear from him again until now, October. He reached out again and said let’s meet up. I confirmed with him yesterday, and he said yes. Today, he texts asking if we’re still meeting. I said yes, 6 p.m. as planned. He leaves me on read for two hours, then finally replies “yes.”

By then, I didn’t even bother getting ready. Based on his track record, I figured he wasn’t going to show up anyway.

And honestly, when he ghosts me or flakes I take my anger out on my kids. It’s not fair to them or to me. I hate that I let someone who clearly doesn’t care affect me like this.

Now I’m just sitting here wondering why I keep giving him chances. Why do I keep letting this guy back in when he’s shown me over and over that he doesn’t value my time or feelings? I feel so stupid, but part of me keeps hoping he’ll follow through just once.

Note:  wrong choice of words. It’s no anger in taking out on my kids. I’m just upset and not in the best mood.  I love these kids!

1oadqey,https://www.reddit.com/r/flexiblestories/comments/1oadqey/episode_6_the_truth/,Episode 6 The Truth.,"Panic surged in me as I was cornered. I was ready to fight them as much as I could. Just when I was ready to punch the guy in front of me, a flying figure came and hit the guy opposite me. The figure started to fight all the goons and soon they ran away in fright. 

Eva: ""That was awesome! You kicked the hell out of them! Where did you learn such crazy moves? Damm!""

No answer 

The alley was really dark, so Eva couldn't make out who it was, but even in the shadows, she could tell it was a girl.

Eva wanted to ask more .... even thank the person but it had left soon after saving her.

Then Eva remembered what had happened in the dance class and that was the reason why she had taken the wrong turn in the first place.

Eva(thinking): ""Where was Liam? I was not even far away from the dance class. He is the sole reason for this. He was so nice at first, and now he is using force just because he knows my secret. I will not let him control me at all. If Liam had been so concerned he should have been the one saving me.""

Eva was hell confused, but she was done for the day. She fell asleep as soon as she touched her bed.

The next day there was yet another letter in her locker which said...

""Never thought that you would actually reply. I appreciate your bravery and now I know that you think about me and care about my feelings as well. Meet me at the coffee shop near your house. I will confess my love directly to you.""

Eva was struck with nervousness but some part inside of her clicked. Curiosity got the best of her, and she decided to meet him. 

Eva(thinking): ""Things are already getting worse day by day, what could possibly get worse than being blackmailed by two people at the same time?""

She decided not to go to the dance class anymore and maybe enrol in another dance class, as she didn't want to see Liam's face at all.

She did double shifts at the restaurant and went to see...him...

She was shaking with fear as she sat with a coffee at the corner table. Her hands were trembling and she wasn't even able to hold the coffee mug straight. She went to the washroom to collect her thoughts, but someone pulled her inside one of the cubicles.....

""Hi there....""

""I was not hoping that you would be here....""

THE STALKER

Eva looked up ..

A masked figure just like yesterday....

Eva: "" So it was you who saved me yesterday!""

Stalker: "" Yes!""

It was wearing a mask and when the mask was removed....

It was a girl from her college, Eva never talked to as she was very reserved, but she always found her cool. 

Her name was Sasha.

She was a girl from the fashion major and always stood out for wearing black clothes and being the tallest girl in college.

Somehow finding that her stalker was a girl relieved her in some way she didn't know how.

Eva(thinking): ""How can she possibly have a crush on me?"" All along I thought it was a creepy guy stalking me.""

Sasha: ""Sorry for freaking you out earlier. I was jealous and wanted you all by myself. I have no problem that you use the dance class for yourself as I love watching you when you dance. You seem as if dance is everything for you. The passion you have for it is just awesome. I used to secretly see you everyday and that was my secret escape until I saw you with Liam. Liam is my ex and I know how toxic he could get if he wants someone. He used to torture me till my core."" 

Sasha removed her tee to revel a crazy hot body but with so many scars. 

Sasha :"" I saw him watching you secretly and I know he loves mysterious girls. I didn't want you to go through any harm so I tried to scare you so that you run away from him but he will not leave you easily that is why I thought I should meet you and tell you everything so that I can help you fight this.""

Eva:"" Why are you so nice to me?""

Sasha: "" I ..... I ...... love you !""

Eva :""huhh! What ? Since when?""

Sasha: ""Since I saw you dancing and ever since I couldn't help myself but watch you everyday. The way you are so simple but so cool , you are always in the shadows but your personality shines upfront. You are so beautiful and that long hair ..... makes me wanna touch every time I see it."" 

Sasha stroked Eva's face and Eva was all flustered.

Sasha: ""You are not saying anything.""

Eva got out of the cubicle and in a fumbling tone said ....

Eva:""I need to go!""

Sasha:""Butt...!""

Eva left haphazardly. 

Sasha has no wright to stop her.

Eva was so confused and lost. She had actually fallen for Liam when he first helped her. She was denying her gut feelings she had last night and wanted to give Liam a chance But now....

Using “Grand Rapids” for searchability, but I’m Lakeshore‑based and prefer nearby hangs (Holland/Zeeland/West Olive/Grand Haven, south into Fennville/Allegan, and inland to Hudsonville/Grandville/Muskegon). 

I’m aiming to build a bromance‑level friendship with a local bro - deep talks, chill hangs, and showing up for each other. If you like quiet, real connection over loud scenes, we’ll get along. 🤝

If we click and you’re farther (Detroit/Chicago, etc.), I’m open to weekend hangs; I have a guest room and you’re welcome to crash.

⸻

About me

🧠 Intuitive introvert / visual‑systems thinker; empathetic with good discernment.

👨‍💻 Tech entrepreneur (AI/automation/cyber). Building software, workflows, and a remote‑first biz; I’m also remodeling my place.

🧰 Hands‑on: gaming, car/house projects, and remodeling.

🧘 Presence > plans: I like just being present, hanging out, talking, shooting the sh*t, and having each other’s back.

⸻

Outdoors & chill spots

🔥 Bonfires/campfires, parks, porch nights.

🌊 Lakeshore: more of a “park by the water, hang in the car, enjoy the view, maybe walk the pier” than sit‑in‑the‑sand.

💧 Water: prefer hot tub/pool (clean, temp‑controlled). I like swimming; not big on cold lake/ocean swims.

⸻

Hobbies & vibe (grouped)

🎱 Games out: playing pool, mini‑golf, arcades.

🎯 Marksmanship: range days.

🚙 Machines & making: cars/tech/trucks/tools, car meets, drag race events,
and getting elbow‑deep wrenching on a weekend hobby project (car/house).

🗺️ Moves: road trips & drives, light camping and campfires.

🍿 Screens: movie marathons & TV‑series binges.

🌲 Low‑key time in nature: just sitting, talking, thinking.

🧭 Vibe: low‑politics; I’m comfortable in right‑leaning spaces and keep things respectful.

⸻

How I show up as a friend (love languages, friend‑mode)

⏱️ Quality time: a steady weekly rhythm; coffee, co‑op, a project night, or a late‑night talk.

🗣️ Encouraging words: real affirmation, straight talk, zero BS.

🧩 Acts of service: I’m a good listener/mediator, offer solid advice, help with tech/workflows, run light errands, and wrench when useful. Parallel‑play/co‑working is welcome (not hunting a “work buddy,” just good company while we build).

🫂 Physical connection (platonic): bro hugs, shoulder/back rubs, couch‑cuddle during a movie, and shared crash space (bed/tent) when it makes sense. Call it homie‑sexual (affectionate with your homies). 😂

⸻

Mindset (light touch)

🧩 Big year: corporate ups/downs and a personal incident in January; I went independent and I’m building better tools, habits, and systems.

🧘 Regulation & awareness: working with mindfulness / CBT‑style tools and a simple “parts/villagers” lens. Observing feelings instead of fusing with them; steady, sustainable routines.

🧭 How I relate: awareness over blame, listening/validation first; solutions when useful.

🤝 What I’m after: not a therapist, just a solid bro who’s comfortable with occasional real talk, then we get back to doing life.

⸻

Who I click with

🧍‍♂️ Average/fit guys who are comfortable in their skin - shirt‑off / beach / locker‑room is no big deal; no judgment, no shame.

🗣️ Emotionally intelligent, open to vulnerability; 1:1 or small‑group hangs.

🎮 Interest overlap: gaming; creating/building; discussing/dreaming; campfires; chill hangs; light adventures; drives; tech deep dives (AI/automation).

🎂 Age: ideally 21–30 (open if the vibe fits). Adults only (21+).

🥃 Occasional social drink is fine; I’m not a beer guy, more a simple mixed drink.

⸻

How we’d hang & logistics

🏡 Host‑friendly in Holland/Lakeshore. Come over, hang, talk; we can chip away at small projects/declutter or work side‑by‑side on your thing/my thing.

🧰 I’m equally down to meet at your garage/shop/house to wrench/build.

📍 Local is best to keep it easy. West MI towns welcome: Zeeland, West Olive, Grand Haven, Spring Lake, Muskegon, Fennville, Allegan, Hudsonville, Grandville (and surrounding). GR when needed.

📅 Let’s aim for a reliable cadence and adjust as we go.

📱 Light daily Snap / quick text check‑ins are great. I prefer in‑person over long text chains; occasional phone/FaceTime > all‑day texting.

⸻

If this sounds like you:

📨 DM age / city (or town) + a few intro lines, your top 3 low‑key hangs, and hang ideas you’re excited about. 

📸 Pics optional, you can find mine on my profile (for context): I’m 6’0”, ~240, down from 313; broad‑shouldered, hairy, teddy‑bear/dad‑bod vibe.

📈 I’m on a long‑term health kick via small habit changes (portion control, better sleep, more walks), not doing drill‑sergeant gym pushes right now. I’m open to light workouts/walks/swims or beginner‑friendly gym sessions if that’s your thing; pace‑friendly and supportive is the goal.

🗣️ If you’re comfortable having the occasional real‑talk check‑in when it feels right (not the main focus), say so.

1oadl2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1oadl2s/25_days_life_without_my_vape/,25 days - Life without my vape,"I’m 29F and vaped for 8 years. I tried quitting once before … made it to 100 days … but my mindset was all wrong. I didn’t want to quit; I was forcing myself. So, of course, I caved.

This time was different.
My reason was simple: “I’ve made my decision.”

That’s it. No bargaining, no conditions. I decided I was done carrying that weight around.

Before quitting, I couldn’t imagine my life without my vape involved in everything I did. Dinner with friends, time with family, relaxing on the couch, vacations, even watching a sunset — I couldn’t picture any of it without my vape. It felt like every good thing in my life would somehow be incomplete without it.

If I took my vape out of the equation, I genuinely believed life would feel meaningless, lackluster, and dull. That’s how deep it had me — it rewired my brain to believe joy was only possible with nicotine.

I’m only 25 days in, and I can’t believe how wrong I was.

Not sure which day the cravings stopped .. maybe around day 14? The withdrawals were brutal at first: irritability, zero focus at work, and constant hunger. I quit on a Tuesday (picked a slow work week on purpose), and after the first weekend without it (no drinking, no going out) I was through the worst of it.

Then, my mental clarity came back.
The feeling of wanting to live again came back.

Now?
- I can leave the house without triple-checking for my vape.
- I can sit through dinner without faking a “bathroom break.”
- I can watch movies/shows without needing a hit 
- I can drink coffee and just enjoy the coffee.
- I can eat a meal and not crave nic right after.
- I can doom-scroll and still enjoy it.
- I can focus on my job and if I get a craving, I grab a snack and move on.

I can do things and actually be present.

Every day I think about it less. At this point, I don’t even crave it anymore. Sometimes the thought crosses my mind - “a rip would be nice” - but it’s fleeting. It doesn’t feel like something I need to enjoy life anymore.

Life without my vape finally feels like life again.

If you’re reading this and you’re scared to quit ... I get it. I used to think nicotine made life better. Turns out, it just made me forget what better actually felt like. I didn’t lose joy when you quit, I go it back. I’m proud of myself, I even love myself more for doing it. 

Weirdly enough, it’s made me want to quit alcohol as well. Not sure if I’ll actually pursue that but since quitting nic was so empowering I’m now thinking…how much better can this (life) get? We’ll have to see. ",3,1760838650.0,QuitVaping,1,1.0,False

Hello Reddit! This feels strange to post, but I’m a 26F trying to find ways to put myself out there to make real lasting genuine friendships. 

When I moved here, it was solely to go to college at CSUF. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize how hard it would be to make friends during my time there. I didn’t know it was mainly a commuter school and i was in a toxic relationship that made it difficult to join clubs/sororities (don’t want to get into the details of it).

Fast forward, I’m 26 met and live with an amazing man and have an adorable cat. I feel like the only thing left for my well being is to find/make some wholesome friends. Working remote 100% has added to the struggle of meeting new people. My bf’s friends have become mine, but would love to make connections of my own. 

Any advice? Some things to know about me:
- live in Orange, grew up in the Bay
- i love to do my own nails
- i love animals (except snakes and bugs)
- keeping up with pop culture (generally speaking)
- watching movies, docus, podcasts
- beginner/intermediate at-home baker
- cat mom
- foodie
-  enjoy visiting local breweries/coffee/matcha/boba spots
- open to walking or easy hiking groups (not really athletic but open to anything for beginners) 

Thanks in advance! ☺️

1oadijs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1oadijs/had_this_nightmare_and_now_im_genuinely_scared/,Had this nightmare and now I'm genuinely scared,"So for context, I met this really cute guy on Grindr (let's call him Danny) and we plan on meeting this morning however I just woke up in the middle of the night because somthing weird happened 

The dream starts off as I'm getting ready to meet Danny at his place but for reasons that have absolutely no relevance to the main plot, my visit gets delayed. I look at the time and it's 9:50 pm already and we were going to meet in the morning, I felt really bad for not seeing him but I was really tired and exhausted too so I just called it a night and went back home. As I open the front door, however, I see Danny, my mom and other relatives sitting on the couch laughing. I'm panicking because no one in my family knows that I'm gay but Danny, somehow played it well. He tod them that he's a friend of mine from college and because my college is in a different town my folks haven't seen him before. 

After everyone leaves he asks me out again and I, nervously, accept. We head out and I remember telling my mom that I'm going out with Danny for a while. She gets reasonably worried because now it's way past 10 pm but Danny was all over my mind by then. We leave the house and I follow Danny to his car. It starts raining a little. I try to open the car door but it's locked, I look back at Danny. He takes out his phone and then starts staring at the screen, completely puzzled. I ask him if something's wrong and he says that he controls the locks of his car through an app on his phone but it's not working for some reason. We figure it could be a bug or maybe something in the car malfunctioned. The rain starts getting heavier so we decide to wait it out in a subway station not far from there. 

We take two steps down the stairs of the station when suddenly a phone rings. I reach down my pocket but my phone was completely silent. It was Danny's...the phone he now held towards me, gesturing to answer the call for him...I look at the screen and then at him, puzzled. His face stern, conveying no emotion. I grabbed the phone and picked up the call

""Hello?"" I speak out in an anxious manner, not sure what to expect 

I hear ruffled noises and faint breathing and then the other person cuts the call. I look at the number and it's usually long, I barely get a glimpse when all of a sudden I hear a gun shot. Instinctively I look to my right and see blood spurting out of Danny's brain as he falls down, first to the ground and then down the stairs since we were still in the middle of them. 

I freeze....I can't look anywhere else just starting at his dead body and then when my mind catches up I start running. There were many other people on the street but none of them had seen anything. Someone must've heard the gun shot but no one came down. I kept running until I reached home. Mom asked me why I was back so soon but I ignore her and go straight up to my room, locked the door and tried to calm myself down...then it hit me, I had to do something or I'll definitely be a prime suspect. I went on a date with a guy and he ended up dead...I gathered some courage, took on a hoodie and went back there. Now it's a crowd around there. I see police vans, tapes everywhere with people gathering around. I push my way towards the centre. There's an officer there taking notes. 

I scream,

*I saw him die* 

He gives me a suprised look and the next thing I know I'm at the station. This random guy is asking me questions and I tell him everything. He asked if I'd like a coffee and informed me that there are consultants here if I ever want to talk and then He says that I'm free to go. So that was it? I thought to myself. I mean, there had to be more, won't they need me afterwards? Why won't I be a prime suspect? Are they really just going to let me walk out this easy

There was a lot of commotion in the hallway...I walk over to the front desk and I see a man with a long coat (which I took to be a detective) standing there with two other officers. They held a map, I recognized the place. It was the same place. They were trying to figure out where the shooter was present.

""In the Park"" I said, ""The bullet was shot from behind"" 

They all look at me, astonished 

""I was there, I saw it happen"" I added before anyone could say anything else

The detective immediately took me into another room and started questioning. So I told him everything, again. But this time he kept asking weird questions like *if it's too hot in here* or *Am I hungry?* Or *Am I half Australian?!*

I took these questions as clever tricks to figure out whether I'm telling the truth or not, judging by my reactions to them. After all that was done the detective asked me if I'd be okay with going back the crime scene to which I replied, yes. We sat on the balcony of a nearby restraunt with a near perfect view of everything. I could see the entrance of the subway station, Dannys locked car still parked near it and the Park across the Road...it was sending shivers down my spine. I mean the killer could still be out there. I look at all the other people sitting around us on the balcony, the guests, the waiters. Every eye contact was a fright. As if at any moment anything could happen. 

There's a buzz on my phone, I take it out. I've got two notifications on WhatsApp. It's from...Danny, but that's impossible. The police had his phone and other belongings. How can someone contact me from that number. I look down at those texts and it's about us,

-*How was your date?*
-*I know where you are*

Everything started making sense then. The car locks not opening, Danny's phone call and now this. We were dealing with a hacker. He hacked into Danny's phone and messed up the locks and now he's texting me through it. (Honestly not sure how realistic this is ToT). I look up again, towards the Park and now I see him standing there in the dark. He looked as though he was in his 30's. He had a big beard and had darker skin complexion. He almost looked Indian. I see him as he lifts his arm and points at me and that is where, ladies and gentlemen, I finally woke up from my nightmare. 

It's 6 am as I'm writing this and now I've to go meet Danny today...I hope nothing bad happens.",1,1760838431.0,Dreams,3,1.0,False
1oadifk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oadifk/aitah_for_driving_a_wedge_between_my_28m_partner/,AITAH for “driving a wedge” between my (28M) partner and his (27F) sister?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years now. He has one sibling, 27F who has a long term partner we’ve become great friends with. Earlier this summer while on vacation we had my engagement ring made, excited about the news I told all of my friends, including sisters partner- with the condition that he not tell the rest of the family. My boyfriend upon hearing this was livid with me and said I had crossed a line and broken his trust. He claimed that he couldn’t understand why I’d trust him with that information and that he was obviously going to run off and spill the information anyway- I disagreed. When congratulated by sister’s partner and asked about it, he proceeded to then lie and say that we never got a ring at all- only to later confess to his parents that we did. 

Fast forwarding to earlier this week, his sister messaged him and asked that they hang out after not seeing each other for so long. She was unavailable that day, so they agreed to try for coffee the next. That following day he calls and texts her and doesn’t get a response and hears from her boyfriend that they were talking atm. He tells me that he’s not going to speak to her for an indefinite period of time over this, that he can’t believe she ignored him, and that the ball is in her court to reach out to him now. I suggest maybe texting her again to clear the air and call her out- something along the lines of “hey wth happened to coffee??” I say maybe she didn’t realize that was a hard plan because they never set a time, or maybe she had things going on, I ask whether or not she even knows he’s upset over this. He shuts it down and says he feels I’m dismissing his feelings and doesn’t want to discuss it further, that she absolutely knows because he mentioned it to her boyfriend the day prior when he stopped by our house- he suggested I even watch our ring camera back as proof that they know of his grievances. 

The next day I go back and do watch the video, and I get this sinking feeling because if it were me, I simply would not have gotten the impression he says he left. So I call the boyfriend and suggest that he ask the sister to reach out again, knowing that my partner wouldn’t. He tells me they had no idea he was angry, and that he’d have her try again for the coffee. Later that evening I get a slew of texts from my boyfriend exclaiming that he’s upset, that I should have let him handle it, and how his mom believes I and driving a wedge between the siblings. Apparently she believes that the ring debacle and this situation exhibits a “pattern that I go behind backs”. 

How I see it is they both miss each other and want the same thing?? I felt that by choosing to not speak to her at all or explain that it hurt his feelings that he wasn’t giving her the opportunity to fix it. In my mind I was only mediating because nothing would’ve gotten solved otherwise but after all of the backlash idk. If I messed up, happy to try and rectify the situation, but currently, I don’t feel like I made some mistake? 

I posted this in a different sub but wasn’t getting a very clear answer on HOW to proceed. I’d like to stay with my partner, and clearly we have a lot to work through, but I’m not sure how to get over this, how to better my relationship with his family, etc ",1,1760838419.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

Hi all! First time posting here but I have friends who have seen success so I figured I’d give it a go. 33F Utah looking for silly, thought-provoking conversations with someone who truly enjoys the little things in life. Best case scenario is to meet my best friend, with the possibility of something further down the line.   
  
**Me**: 5’2”, 125 lbs., long brown hair and blue eyes (happy to share a photo once we're chatting). I love my charming little life and am looking for other like-minded people. I live with intention and empathy for the people around me and am judgement-free. I love coffee, cooking/pastry, a walk around the city, and an old used book store. I’m a bit morbid (I work in the deathcare industry), love anything spooky/horror related, and can be found on any given evening on the couch, wrapped up in a good book with some incense burning and a delicious, hot bev in my hand. I also dabble in video games, enjoy long walks, learning new things, and learning about off the grid lifestyles. I went to college/uni three times and have done almost nothing with those degrees. So it goes.  
  
Out in the world, I love a liminal space, people watching, and a day in the park with some good food and good conversation. I love plants, animals, and starting new hobbies. Life wasn’t always kind to me but I’m really proud of the person I am now and am always striving to grow/improve. One day I want to retire to a tiny bit of property in the middle of nowhere and live out all my cottagecore dreams. I am very creative, independent, a bit nerdy, and love anything artsy.   
  
**You**: Funny, enthusiastic about life, have a strong sense of who you are and possess the ability to hold up your end of a conversation. Together we’ll have many goofy conversations about scenarios that will never happen and plan ridiculous adventures to have one day. You are intuitive, smart, and love a cheesy movie. Bonus points if you’re introverted, are very passionate about your hobbies, have a dad bod or love a good debate. Tell me about things you love and dreams you have.  
  
Things that keep me up at night: staircases in the forest, what those two red eyes that keep staring at me through the window are, cave diving accidents.  
  
If you’ve made it this far, have a fave recipe, or a horror book/movie recommendation, please don’t hesitate to reach out. :)

Nothing serious or complicated, just genuine conversation. I’m open to talking about pretty much anything, whether it’s random thoughts, hobbies, life experiences, or things you’re passionate about. I really enjoy hearing about other people’s interests and perspectives; it’s always fascinating how differently everyone sees the world. I’d say I’m a pretty open minded person, and I appreciate when conversations flow naturally without pressure or judgment.

All I ask is that you keep things respectful and not make it awkward. Reddit’s already chaotic enough, let’s not add to it. No expectations here, no hidden agenda, just looking for people who can hold a good, honest conversation.

As for me, I figured I’d share a little. I like to stay active when I can since work tends to get busy. I enjoy exploring new places whenever time allows, whether it’s trying a new coffee spot, going for a drive, or finding a hiking trail. I also love being creative whether it’s writing, painting, or just working on something that lets me express myself.

1oaden4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oaden4,Any advice for a newbie? [Ultima Cosa & Comandante],"Hey all! Long time lurker here and been diving into the rabbit hole of coffee as a hobby for the past year or so. Just looking for something guidance and advice! 

I apologize in advance for any formatting mistakes I make posting here. I don’t post a lot on Reddit! 

I have a pretty garbage espresso machine. Can’t find a huge amount of info on it so I’m unsure of what pressure it uses and such and that’s pretty much the only variable I haven’t accounted for yet. (Ultima Cosa is the brand) I got it for cheep at a pawn shop and it kick started my hobby! 

I have a Comandante hand grinder with the red clix upgrade. I’m using a good quality Normcore precision 58mm 18g basket. I’m also using freshly roasted coffee. 

I’m doing the RDT before grinding and using a paper filter at the bottom of my basket, I’m WDT before I tamp and making sure no lumps. Tamping with a Normcore self leveling tamper. Then using a puck screen. 

I then flush my group head before I pull a shot. The video is the best I can dial in time and weight wise (that I could get on camera) I know I’m about 10 seconds off the usual time but if I go one step courser the shot pulls way too fast. I’m unsure if it’s my machine or if it’s not the right grind setting. I know the Comandante isn’t the best for espresso but it’s all I have for now. I’m also using filtered water.

All the pictures are stages of my puck prep and espresso set up. It wouldn’t let me upload a video of the shot I pulled so I took some screenshots of it and the final result. 

I’ve been finding some of my shots are bitter and some are sour a lot seem watery. I can’t for the life of me enjoy a shot of espresso. One sip is enough haha When making a latte the coffee flavour doesn’t shine through it seems muted.

Any advice or help is appreciated!

Yeah, I used to eat burgers, pizza, instant noodles and stuff but so rare compared to other people. Also I love fruits and veggies. 

I used to have abdominal pains but the first ones went away even if I didn't do anything. The ones that made me go to the hospital/ER were the ones that didn't go away unless I'm given hydromorphone thru IV. And there I got diagnosed when they saw in ultrasounds that I have multiple gallstones. 

Ever since I had it removed, I had nothing to complain except for the day 1-3 when I had shoulder pains due to the carbon dioxide. Other than that nothing. I think staying on the ""no fat, no dairy, no anything that trigger spasms on the abdomen"" diet really helped. All I ate were boiled or steamed veggies, some whole wheat bread and/or pasta, popsicles with no sugar, and no coffee, in the first 2 weeks. 

But hours after my ERCP, I had a horrible stomach pain, lipase increased, and mild pancreatitis. I also had horrible neck, back, throat and hip pains on day 3 post ERCP. Yes, the GI doctor warned me about some of those. I still proceeded because the remaining stone in the bile duct was needed to be removed. Though it felt like ""gambling"" because there are chances of either good or bad things. You just have to find a good GI doctor who does ERCP, have cholangiogram/cholangiography and have a good surgeon, so your odds of getting good results will increase. 

Now, I went back to having coffee, and eating normally and when I say ""normally"" it's still not the almost everyday burger, fries, pizza, anything deep fried. When I say normally, it's a balanced meal - with healthy fats, healthy sweet food like fruits, some cheese, coconut water, all natural lemonade, veggies and very rare and in moderation chocolate, or fried (not deep fried) chicken or potato in extra virgin oil. To make ot short, yes, I eat fats, and dairy but I don't go overboard. And... I feel fine! No diarrhea or any pains. My ""not normally"" was super bland, unbalanced diet - no fats, no dairy and fats are necessary. There's ""healthy fats"" out there. Still, if you have a gallbladder it might contract and make the stones move so I just have to remind you that this is for people who are ""post op"" or no gallbladder.

I went back to doing chores but I haven't gone back to the gym. I still don't lift stuff that's heavier than 10 lbs. I just walk outside everyday when I have time. Some stretching also helped. 

Sometimes, I try small or bite size of food like... Chocolate? No pain. Fried chicken? No pain. Parmesan cheese? No pain. Just out of curiousity. So far, all is well.

It's definitely possible to live without gallbladder. I have no regrets. 

P.S. I haven't tried eggs. Not really a fan of them anyway. But if there's anything I miss, it's sashimi.  ",2,1760838055.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I think the only country I've been to with better coffee and better coffee culture than Australia is Indonesia. Man, they take it for absolute granted that their coffee is amazing. EVERYWHERE.

At home I roast my own beans and I'm known amongst my guests for having amazing coffee and I always get complimented on it.

However, when we had Indonesian guests, I got nothing. No compliments at all. It's just another decent coffee moment for them. It's nothing special.

1oadcfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1oadcfp/beginner_writer/,Beginner Writer,"It was a cold September; Septembers were always so cold, though this one felt colder than most. The attendants always made sure to close the windows, during lights out. And yet, it always felt like a cold, windy, winter drifting through the room. This always bothered me, and me only. Apparently, my bunkmates didn’t mind the breeze; if they felt it at all. 

I could barely sleep that night. My mind racing 100 miles per second; thinking, feeling, hurting. I twisted and turned in my sheets all night, until I stopped, facing the window looking down from above at the autumn leaves in all their glory. There was yellow, green, and my bunkmate, Lollis’, favorite, red. Every time we would go outside for our morning walk, Lolli, would always stop at every tree we walked past and grab a red leaf. And when we would head back to the orphanage, she would hand her collection of red leaves to Ms. Helene. 

I always liked Lolli. She was blond-haired, with blue eyes, and with little cute freckles on each side of her cheeks. I remember the last time we went out for our morning walk. She walked next to me, greeting me with her usual smile; the type of smile that’s filled with that certain spark of joy, adventure, and love. Every time I saw that smile, I knew everything was going to be okay. When I saw that smile, I felt security. I felt understood. Alas, that was some time ago; days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. But not a day goes by, where I forget that smile. 

And just in that moment. Just thinking of that smile. Everything felt slow; my mind, no longer racing 100 miles per hour, and the breeze? “...what breeze?...” I asked myself. That winter drift, now feeling like a warm summer. The twisting and turning; now a sudden halt. The anxious look on my face; now a warm smile. And in that moment, I may not have felt understood, but I did feel security. I knew that I was going to be just fine. “...Everything is going to be just fine...” I thought to myself, as I closed my eyes, and drifted away into a deep slumber. 

I could a hear a set of keys jingle ever so slightly in the near distance, and suddenly; what used to be a midnight, dark, ocean blue flipped over to a bright, yellowish-orange, sun. As I tried to cover my eyes from the blinding light, I unfortunately could not drown out all the ruckus. “...Everyone up!...” the attendant called out. My bunkmates of course, answering the call and leaving for the dining hall for breakfast. 

With everyone gone, it was just me left to my lonesome. “...Come on, buddy!...” the attendant called out. “...Everyone else is gone...” As he was still calling out to me, I just laid down in my sheets; motionless. It wasn’t until after about ten minutes he sighed and walked over to me, picking me up from my sheets; grunting. “...Wow, buddy, you really are heavy...”  the attendant said; still grunting after picking me up. “...I’m not, that ‘heavy’...” I thought to myself. 

As we were heading out, the cleaners were entering in. There were two; one short with blond, scruffy hair, and a small bruise on his left cheek. He also had a weird odor to him. “...Yuck...” I thought. The other, however, his name was Jim. I loved Jim. He was always nice to me and would sometimes give me extra snacks before lights out. Every time he saw me, he would give his usual smile. A smile that you know is full of deep understanding and unconditional love; glistening like gold, covered by the afternoon sun. 

Though, when I took a quick glance, he didn’t seem his usual self. He had the look of disappointment on his face; the type of disappointment when you hand your parents a failing report card. I knew that look all too well. It was always the same look; all the new families would give me when they saw me... 

Before I even knew it, I was interrupted by a sudden clang. While down this trip in memory lane, I didn’t even realize that we entered the dining hall. I didn’t realize that the attendant sat me down, so he could grab me my breakfast. “...Was I really that disconnected from reality?...” I thought to myself. This has been happening ever so recently. If I remember correctly, it started last year...Eh, I digress. “...I’m too hungry...” 

As I started to eat my breakfast, I looked around the dining hall; observing everyone and everything around me. It was quite loud this morning. Though, it was always loud in the mornings. And it would be, until... “QUIET!!!”  And just then, I felt like I could hear crickets. I was not very frightened, nor surprised, though. Just like routine, it would be very loud, and then Ms. Vincenzo would silence everyone, with just one word; “Quiet”. Ms. Vincenzo was the head director of the shelter. 

When it came to, Ms. Vincenzo, at first you would think she would be this haggard, bittered, and old-fashioned woman. I know I did. But she wasn’t. Okay, maybe she was old-fashioned, but besides that, Ms. Vincenzo was actually in her mid-20's. At least, that’s what I heard from one of the attendants. Just barely, though. Ms. Vincenzo had long, beautiful raven-like hair; that she would always put into a bun, on the top of her crown. Two hazel eyes; a unique blend, such as a morning roast; a dark and somewhat bitter taste, yet a soothing and warm feeling. And a very glistening, tanned complexion. Her skin, almost like caramel; dipped in coffee and coated in sugar. 

I will admit, though, it did take me a while to see through her “act”. But when I did, I wasn’t as scared of Ms. Vincenzo as I was when I first arrived. I knew that she loved us, all of us. And every time I see Ms. Vincenzo, I feel a warm embrace inside my heart. As warm as a fire on a cold, shivering, winter night. Cuddling up with your loved one(s), drinking hot cocoa; forgetting all of your worries and complexities. The younger ones on the other hand... 

I remember a time where one kid accidentally wet himself, just by hearing her name. I smirked just by thinking about it. Before lights out I would sometimes tell them “...Ms. Vincenzo is coming. You better hide...” And the look on their face? Just golden. “...Good times...” I thought to myself. 

I was still eating my breakfast; or what was left of it. When I overheard a conversation between Ms. Vincenzo and the attendant that dragged and picked me up from my bunk. I could faintly hear what was being said, but I was able to make some of it out. “...He is always...trouble, you...know it...” I looked baffled. “...I’m not always trouble, am I?...” I thought to myself. “...Yes, I know...” She sighed. She quickly took a glance at me and then turned back to the attendant. “...I know...he is trouble...” She looked slightly disappointed when saying that. Disappointed in me. 

I couldn’t bear Ms. Vincenzo being disappointed in me. I always tried to strive to be the best of myself. “...If only I could talk to you...” I thought to myself. “...If only I could explain myself...”. Then everything would be fine. I wouldn’t be considered “trouble”. I wouldn’t be a disappointment. Weeping silently, I slowly rested my head. Trying to drown out the conversation. Trying to drown out everything and everyone around me. Yet, everything and everyone was drowning me out; flooding through my head at rapid speed. 

What was only 5 minutes, felt like 2 hours. Replaying past conversations, memories; nightmares. Over and over again; disconnecting from reality. Then just like before, a sudden interruption. Not a sound this time, though. But a singular brush on my hide. “...One singular brush...” I thought to myself. But I wasn’t thinking in that moment. I was protecting myself. Then what felt like negative emotions, boiling up inside. All the anger, the hate; almost like my soul engulfed by the sin of wrath, suddenly turned into involuntary movement. 

Suddenly, almost like time had frozen in place; my mind now coming to an immediate stop. A rapid pace; now a sudden halt. A whimper; now silence. Everything changed in that one, singular moment. And as I looked up, I saw her. “...No, not her. Please. Anyone else, but her...” I said to myself. But that was it, it was only just me. Only me who heard my weeps of sorrow. Only me who felt cold during the night. And only me who could really understand who I was. 

And then, the feeling of “warmth” embracement; now a sense of betrayal. And her eyes...god her eyes. What was once a blend of warmth and bitter; now just bitter and cold. As if only her last sense of hope; a spark inside her. Now burned out. ",1,1760837899.0,writers,1,1.0,False

The horoscopes are written using **Western Tropical astrology in the whole sign house system.** Even if you use a quadrant system, such as Placidus, I recommend reading by rising sign as is. Also, some of you may get additional insight by reading for your sun or moon sign due to derivative astrology. Keep in mind though, the rising sign should be most accurate unless your chart has specific placements that would change the meaning.

**Aries Rising:**  
  
Over the past week, romantic feelings may have come to the surface. Your home has felt warm and nurturing, and overall things are going pretty well with you.

With a new moon in your 7th house, this is a time for you to reflect upon your relationships. Maybe things have gotten into a rut, or there may be power dynamics at play. Regardless of what is happening, this is your opportunity to change your perspective and create a fresh start.

Take this time to reflect on what the two of you have built together. Look around your home environment, and think about your long-term path forward. Discuss your wants and needs with your partner and encourage them to express theirs. The key here is not to fall into who is going to win, but instead how you can build a life that makes you both happy. Focus on both the big picture and the details on how to make the big picture come to fruition.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters, which is love. It’s easy to get lost in what you don’t have and not be grateful for what you do have. Take a few moments to reflect on the path of your closest relationships and how they developed over time. Use this information as a foundation to create positive change.

**Taurus Rising:**

Lately, when it comes to your day-to-day life, you have felt more positive about potential outcomes. You may have been conscientious about the food that you’re eating or negotiating with your boss for an increase in income.

This new moon falls in your 6th house of routines, health, and work. This is a chance for you to have a fresh start in regards to your daily habits, if you haven’t already done so. This can be a great time to tidy up your workspace, put some houseplants around you that help purify the air (just make sure they’re safe for any pets you have), or hang up pictures of your loved ones. It’s about making yourself comfortable so you can be more productive.

And if you are in a romantic relationship, this is a great time to take some action in regards to communication of responsibilities. Or, if there’s a balance between work and life, go out with some other couples to a local spot that you find warm and inviting. Conversations can flow and be dynamic or enlightening.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Think about what would be the most harmonious routine you can stick to without much effort or interference from the other people you share space with. Sometimes it’s the little things that make our life easier, like food prepping for the week, switching to instant coffee, or small hacks such as brushing your teeth while you’re taking a shower. Once you know two or three things that can make some positive changes, work on implementing them into your life.

**Gemini Rising:**

You’ve most likely been feeling quite creative lately. You may have picked up a brush dripping with paint, written a song, or pursued some other creative outlet. You’ve been quite busy handling work responsibilities and taking action with the details.

With the Libra new moon in your 5th house, you may gain some insight on a project you are working on and have a breakthrough. You may even decide to start over on something after gaining clarity or being inspired by a muse. You also could be feeling quite flirty lately.

You could be focused on your personal values in a grand way or investing in educational pursuits. You may be more optimistic about your long-term pursuits, and this new moon could provide additional information about implementation.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** This is a time to think about what brings joy and bliss into your life. If you are not in a loving relationship, this is a great time to manifest that into your life. Just remember, you need to love yourself completely first, and when you do, you will open the door to meeting someone special. And as a side note, you need to be out and about with other people in order to meet that person.

**Cancer Rising:**

The past week you’ve been tidying up your home and getting creative ideas on how to decorate your space. You also may be publishing articles, writing a book, creating coursework, or learning something new.

With the new moon in your 4th house, you may be reframing your thoughts about your family and childhood and how those relationships have played out over the years. Though some of these themes could be sensitive, with love and forgiveness, you may be able to see some of the dynamics in a different light as opposed to a power struggle or a test of wills.

Sometimes to move through the past we have to create an environment that reflects who we are now. You may have a desire to change out pictures that are in frames or hang up artwork that has deep personal meaning. You also may be gearing up for a long-distance trip, quite possibly to a place where you’ve lived before.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** This would be a good time to think about the people who have hurt you, especially family members or those from your younger years. Instead of thinking about the hurt and pain, and if you are emotionally ready, imagine them in a positive light and frame them as your supporters rather than your detractors. This meditation can help shift the energy between you and those memories that are holding you back from your authentic and loving self.

**Leo Rising:**

I would not be surprised if, in the past week, you’ve driven by a playground and felt an urge to get out of your car and jump on one of the swings or climb on the jungle gym. You could be longing for a simpler time, where you knew everyone in the neighborhood and an experience was right around the corner.

With the new moon in your 3rd house, this is a great time to focus on the peace and harmony you’d like in your neighborhood. You may be inspired to throw a block party or do some sort of community outreach. There may be a realization of how disconnected you’ve been from those around you and a desire to reconnect.

There is a chance you are thinking about relocating or changing your residence. You could also be considering doing renovations around your home. This is the time to think optimistically but also ensure that you cover each detail and create a solid plan that can be executed.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** During the new moon, think about how you made friends as a child. You most likely had friends who came from different cultures, whose families had different ideas or belief systems than yours, yet you were able to find commonality with each other. Ask yourself if you’ve lost that ability to connect to people who are different from you, and if so, how can you create friendships like you did when you were young.

**Virgo Rising:**

There’s a possibility that your boss is floating the idea of increasing your pay, or you could have recently had a bump in income. You may have been making a concerted effort to be with your friends or join a social group or cause.

With the new moon in your 2nd house, you may be reevaluating your own personal values. Finding balance may be a priority for you right now. You also could be surrounding yourself with pretty things and displaying your prized collections.

When it comes to your community, you may have a desire to take on more responsibility in maintaining relationships. Spending time at your local coffee shop and making new friends or attending local events such as fairs, concerts, or art and craft shows can give you a sense of belonging.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** With the influence of Libra, what are the things that bring you peace and personal fulfillment? If your home is filled with things that weigh you down, maybe it’s time to sell them so you can fill your space with the things that bring you joy. Or this could be a reflection about the people in your life and whether you are valuing them as much as you love them.

**Libra Rising:**

Lately, you’ve been focused on your appearance and how you project yourself to the outside world. Though you embrace harmony, you’ve been in a much more peaceful mood lately. You may have mentioned to someone how you feel more balanced, especially when it comes to work and responsibility.

With the new moon, this is a great time to reset your boundaries. This doesn’t mean you need to have conflict with others but instead maintain the sense of well-being that you’re having right now. What can you do to prolong this feeling of peace and satisfaction? It is okay to put yourself first, and that’s what the Libra new moon in your 1st house is reminding you to do.

And as a reminder, it is okay to put those boundaries in place at work. You are most likely someone who not only does your own work but also takes on roles that are not assigned to you. You don’t have to be the only one who picks up the slack. Though it feels great that everyone wants your expertise, just remember that it’s also okay to gently remind them what your actual responsibilities are and that you’re taking care of those first.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Look at the times in the past that led to you being overwhelmed and overworked. You may say yes and underestimate the length of time certain projects will take or that one question could lead to many more. Though saying no may be difficult for you, how would things play out if you said maybe or I don’t know as opposed to yes?

**Scorpio Rising:**

You may have had a mental reprieve lately, feeling much more connected to spirit or tapping into your own private sanctuary. You may have taken action by writing in a journal or expressing your thoughts to make sense of the harmonious feelings you are experiencing.

With a new moon in your 12th house, this is the perfect time for meditation, yoga, breath work, prayer, chanting, or any other spiritual activity that brings you peace and understanding. If you can go to a crystal bowl sound bath, you could start a new spiritual journey that changes your everyday thoughts.

You may have had some blocks recently in regards to your creativity, though that doesn’t mean you haven’t had a lot of big ideas. The blocks have more to do with how to implement those ideas. This is why meditation can open up a door of taking ownership of mind, body, and soul.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** The flow of water can liberate you from your rut. Whether you take a swim in the ocean, float in a pool, or take a long shower, use these actions to help you tap into your higher self. This is a great time to do some automatic writing, meditative journaling, or deep discussions with a close confidant. Just let yourself be open to the experience rather than being focused on one particular thing.

**Sagittarius Rising:**

You’ve been a social butterfly lately, enjoying the company of friends, whether new ones or those you’ve been close to for years. If you haven’t gone to a concert recently, there’s a good chance you’ve been looking at upcoming shows and may have even bought tickets.

With the new moon in your 11th house, you could be thinking about what it means to be a friend and what you desire from your friendships. You may also be thinking about how you could be more engaged in social causes, especially those that relate to your belief system or your sense of freedom and justice. Regardless, friendship and community are where you’re feeling balanced and hopeful.

You could be dealing with some family matters right now and may have to step into responsibility, especially with a parent or grandparent. You may need to find resources for them and take action for their health and well-being.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Friendships may come and go, but understanding the importance of your connections with other people is how we create a society that benefits everyone. Take this time to visualize a utopian world, and as you do so, imagine light around every person on earth and the connective thread between all of us.

**Capricorn Rising:**

Work has been quite harmonious lately for you, and your relationship with your boss has probably been the best it’s been in a while. There’s a great chance that you’ve been networking lately and meeting new connections to help you grow in your career.

With the new moon in your 10th house, this could be a good time to create a strategy for getting a raise or taking on a new role. You may want to take the next few days and write out all of your accomplishments, especially those that display your contributions to the team and how well you work with your teammates.

If you and your romantic partner have not been out on a date lately, this is a great time to do so. This could be a romantic and nurturing time for the two of you, and you may even explore activities like tango dancing or playful outings. You don’t have to go too far out of your comfort zone to have fun; just make sure the two of you are on the same page and feel safe.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Focus on your dream career and how you want to be known for the work that you do. How can you have a work environment that is peaceful yet productive, harmonious yet profitable? Understanding that you can bring balance into the trajectory of your career can help you achieve your goals without frustration.

**Aquarius Rising:**

Have you been thinking about going to a retreat or vacation? You could be yearning for a place to unwind and relax. You may have a desire to visit museums, especially ones that host art or cultural artifacts.

With the Libra new moon in your 9th house, a change of scenery may do you good. You don’t necessarily have to travel far, but going somewhere new, especially somewhere that expands your mind or gives you an appreciation for another culture, could be a great way to add equilibrium to your life.

Work has been quite busy for you, and your day-to-day tasks are keeping you hopping. You’re happy that the days are going fast, but you crave something different to do. You may also have had extra responsibilities added to your workload or needed to give a presentation about your department’s successes or challenges.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Take the time to gain a new perspective on diversity in the world. Esoterically, you understand that we all have many similarities. However, understanding and appreciating the differences can show you how the world balances itself by hosting a variety of beliefs, cultures, and practices.

**Pisces Rising:**

There may have been a recent increase of income for you or your partner. If neither of you has received a raise, you may want to check out your investments or the value of your property. Even if your finances are doing well, you may want to ensure that your portfolio is balanced and schedule an appointment with a financial advisor to keep the surplus intact.

With the new moon in your 8th house, it is about your joint resources. You may want to beautify any property that you own. If you have family heirlooms or antiques, consider having insurance on them or keeping them in a safe place.

You could feel like you are carrying the weight on your shoulders when it comes to practical matters, something that you’re not the most comfortable doing. However, taking responsibility now can help you prepare for the immediate future. If you have children, you most likely have been in deep conversations with them and could be thinking about your legacy and what you will pass down someday.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Thinking about the past and times of turmoil can actually help you find balance in your current situation. Throughout life, we tend to have highs and lows. Unfortunately, we rarely prepare for the lows while enjoying the highs. Since you may have had many blessings recently, saving for a rainy day or even a drought can help you through rough times. Ask for guidance from professionals if needed; otherwise, write out a personal plan that can bring you a sense of peace and practicality.

I'm trying to bring an older coffee machine back to life. 120V goes in on the top right red pin, and out on the left. There is no continuity between right and left red though, I figured there must have been an internal fuse or the connection broke. But there is continuity from blue to right red? It wasn't connected when I opened it, and the pin seems shaved off almost.

What I was thinking would be to put an external fuse on blue and use that one, since the right red doesn't work, but it seems too convenient that there would be a spare with no fuse. I had found an old forum of someone doing the same thing as me, and some people suggested that maybe it was if the input was 100V instead? On that same forum, someone said they had just used the blue one and it was fine. I'd rather get a second opinion, though.

It’s a very strong vitamin smell, if you’ve ever taken a stinky vitamin, you’ll know the smell. It’s so bad that I haven’t been able to put anything in any of the drawers since we moved in. 

The house is about 15 years old and we have lived here for 4 months. We purchased the house from an older couple who took a TON of very pungent vitamins, as evidenced by the bags of vitamins found when we removed the drawers. 

The window in our bathroom doesn’t open but here’s what I’ve tried:
1. Today: have been running both exhaust fans all day, alongside an air purifier on high with all other doors closed
2. Removed all drawers, cleaned them with powdered tide and hot water, and left them in the sun outside all day 
3. Cleaned them with Lysol disinfecting spray and put them in the sun outside all day
4. Cleaned inside the vanity frames with Lysol disinfecting spray, let it dry, then sprayed down with Zero Odor 
5. Left the drawers out and doors open to air it out, this seems to be making the odors stronger today
6. Previously, I’ve put boxes of baking soda in each drawer and also bowls of coffee grounds to absorb odors 

Nothing is working. It’s all I can smell in the bathroom, to the point where I’m nauseous when trying to brush my teeth. Since I am sensitive to smells, I don’t like artificial fragrance but I don’t mind the scent of bleach. The Lysol disinfectant spray I used smells like is peppermint which I don’t mind but I can still smell the vitamin odor seeping through. 

Should I try bleach next? Should we vacate the house for a bit and rent an ozonator? I’m open to any and all suggestions, I’d like to update the bathroom but I’d like to wait a few years before a major gut reno.",2,1760837096.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

1oad1ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oad1ac/i_want_to_die_before_my_mother/,I want to die before my mother,"Hi. I apologize for this being a rambling post, but I really want to get this off my chest. I've been going through a very difficult time for some time now; I feel lost in life. I live in the same house with my mother and sister. I can't move out because I have no money. I'm terrified of social contact, so I only work part-time and can't support myself. The thought of moving out and living alone is also stressful. My sister is sick, very aggressive, hits people, destroys window sills, smashes glass in doors, makes holes in the walls by banging on them with her hands, and there are arguments every day, which affects my mother, who has health problems, high blood pressure, asthma, and many other illnesses I don't even know the names of.All I know is that her test results are very bad, and her condition is supposedly deteriorating. My father keeps sending me messages that my mother is getting worse and it's my fault because I can't become independent and move out. But I'm so scared. I think my mother is stressed about my sister having to take care of her, and she's burdened by it, but I can't help her because I'm afraid of my sister. She recently poured boiling coffee on me, and every day I hear her cursing at me in the other room, saying that killing me wouldn't be enough. They don't understand, even though they're aware of how she feels about me. I want to leave the house and never come back. Go out into the woods and freeze or starve to death because I'm too weak to end my life the way people do. The knowledge that my mother won't be there is simply terrifying. I can't imagine it. I didn't sleep all night last night because I thought I could be at her funeral. I can't let her die before me.I love her very much and I don't want to be a failure for her either. I want her to think that I've left, moved out and become responsible for myself, as she always wanted. She often says that I'm a failure and that she's ashamed of me. It breaks my heart when I hear that because I love her very much and I don't want to be a disappointment to her.",2,1760836942.0,depression,0,1.0,False

1oacxra,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oacxra,Libra New Moon October 2025: Astrology Insights and Horoscopes,"At the end of Libra season, we have a New Moon at 28°21’. This formation is a dynamic T-square with Jupiter in Cancer at 24° and Pluto in Aquarius at 1°. While the opposition between Jupiter and Pluto is wide (about 7 degrees,) I’m including it because both planets are slow-moving, social and generational influences, and their tense energy is indicative of what is happening now throughout the world. In LUNA Astrology Software, this aspect appears as a solid line, indicating significant influence. The same is true on [Astro.com](http://Astro.com), while Astro-Seek renders it as a dotted line, suggesting a secondary influence that still reflects the energy at play. Granted, I know that there are astrologers who may use a tighter orb of influence, but I don’t think we can negate Pluto’s power and grand scheme in regards to current events.

I also consider this opposition active because the New Moon itself pulls it into focus. The luminaries square both Jupiter and Pluto, re-activating the larger cycle that’s been building for months. Jupiter expands what it touches, and Pluto exposes power dynamics, manipulation, and the deeper structures driving events. From protests to government shut downs, we are experiencing opposition in action. Could it be stronger? Yes, and that is something we will see when Jupiter goes into Leo next year and makes an exact opposition on July 20th, 2026 creating a basket formation with Uranus and Neptune. I’d like to think of the current energy as a precursor to that moment, with the Libra new moon as an opportunity to create something that involves society striving for cooperation, fairness, and harmony. But with everything, what happens is up to all of us, not just my hopes and dreams.

With that said, when Jupiter, the planet of law, religion and excesses, opposes Pluto the planet of deep change, crisis, destruction and regeneration, it is my opinion that we are already seeing the interplay of these two energies. Together, they represent ideological extremes, moral crusades, and an inflated sense of “truth” or righteousness. But they are not acting alone, and are in some ways, a result of when Pluto was in Capricorn and Neptune was in Pisces. But this article is about the energy of the moment, so I don’t want to dig too much into the past. My point here is not to dismiss Jupiter-Pluto opposition, even though some may do so due to the width of the orb.

Let’s discuss how the Libra New Moon adds a layer of social awareness. First of all, a new moon combines the energy of the soul, the outward expression of self with our innermost feelings. The zodiac sign of Libra is about making relationships work. Though questions of justice, balance, and fairness come to the forefront, there is also a desire to come together, though there may not be much focus on what to do during the gathering. But the energy of the new moon can be the steps needed, be it in society or at home within your own relationships.

With the moon square to Pluto, we are given an opportunity to examine how we emotionally relate to others, and if we take the time to analyze, we may learn we either play the emotional tormentor or victim. This can be a profound moment of self-exploration, and a catalyst for change. With the Sun square to Pluto, you may be having conflicts with authority figures, feeling challenged in your own self expression. This can be on a grand social scale or with your partner, boss or someone else in your circle. However, though the tension with Pluto can be jarring, Pluto gives you a passage to let go of old patterns and get in tune with your authentic self.

But then we also have Jupiter in the mix. Jupiter at its core is optimistic, and during turbulent times, having optimism is essential. With Jupiter in exaltation in Cancer, which is ruled by the moon, there is a sense of holding on to the past, protective and emotionally sensitive. Indirectly, Cancer is also about the home, and a hermit crab comes to mind. Unlike other crabs, hermit crabs don’t create their own shells but instead, house themselves in discarded shells. Through the turmoil that is happening in the world, we could take on the optimistic perspective of the hermit crab, living in a shell that is too small and tight, that is no longer working for their needs. However, though the crab may like its old home and remembers when it was a perfect fit, it needs to venture out and find a better shell, one that fits them now. It is the optimism of creating something better during a time of restriction, where Jupiter can shine.

With the Moon and Sun square to Jupiter, this is a time to expel any self-righteousness and instead embrace benevolence. It is about setting long term goals with confidence for success. It is not about falling prey to excesses but instead, to have gratitude and appreciation for what is happening now, even if times are difficult. The new moon gives us a mirror and a grand picture view, allowing us to create a plan to find that proverbial hermit crab home.

In 1967, the Beatles released the song “All You Need is Love,” which was backdropped amid protests and riots. As I noticed that Venus is unaspected but in its domicile zodiac sign of Libra during the new moon, the song’s lyrics and John Lennon’s voice melodically floated into my mind. I know often we want to escape back to when times seemed peaceful, but understanding that times like these are temporary, we can see a hopeful but different future. When a planet is unaspected, we can experience it in its truest form. Venus is here to remind us that our values our sound when they are entwined with love, peace, and harmony. And I don’t know about you, but those nightly dancing inflatable frogs in Portland give me a feeling that eventually, everything will be alright.

Mars and Mercury are also conjunct on the day of the new moon, in the sign of Scorpio. It will be easy for people to get into debates, especially days leading up and on the day of the new moon. But, if you can listen to other people’s point of view, even if you disagree with them, you may be able to discover the root causes that brought us to this place in time. Yes, life is intense right now, but through the passionate, strong-willed forces that are out there, we can be reflective and introspective and discover ways to build bridges, which just may be through embracing the words of John Lennon.

Mars and Mercury are in a grand trine with Jupiter in Cancer and Saturn in Pisces. This is a lot of water energy, so even though the new moon is in an air sign, there is an undercurrent that is below the surface. The water grand trine can help your plans flow. This is why this new moon can be a great moon for manifesting, long term planning or launching a project. Jupiter can give you the high level point of view and help with expansion of your ideas. Saturn allows for discipline, discernment and to pay attention to details (something that Jupiter tends to overlook.) Your intuition may be activated during the new moon, so set aside some time to meditate or journal.

The Libra new moon is an opportunity to shift your perspective and make long term plans during these heightened times. Embrace love and connection with others and create relationships that build understanding. This doesn’t mean that you need to change your point of view, but sometimes we need to go into another “shell” to see how everything fits together.

Much of this energy can be felt before October 21st, 2025 and for some days afterwards. But, if you want to meditate or manifest at the moment the moon is new, you can do so at 12:25 AM UTC (which is 7:25 AM CDT.)

Now that we’ve explored the overarching energy, let’s look at how the energy can play out on an individual basis through horoscope readings.

# Horoscopes by Rising Sign

The horoscopes are written using Western Tropical astrology in a whole sign house system. Even if you use a quadrant system, such as Placidus, I recommend reading by rising sign. Also, some of you may get additional insight by reading for your sun or moon sign due to derivative astrology. Keep in mind though, the rising sign should be most accurate unless your chart has specific placements that would change the meaning.

**Aries Rising:**  
  
Over the past week, romantic feelings may have come to the surface. Your home has felt warm and nurturing, and overall things are going pretty well with you.

With a new moon in your 7th house, this is a time for you to reflect upon your relationships. Maybe things have gotten into a rut, or there may be power dynamics at play. Regardless of what is happening, this is your opportunity to change your perspective and create a fresh start.

Take this time to reflect on what the two of you have built together. Look around your home environment, and think about your long-term path forward. Discuss your wants and needs with your partner and encourage them to express theirs. The key here is not to fall into who is going to win, but instead how you can build a life that makes you both happy. Focus on both the big picture and the details on how to make the big picture come to fruition.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters, which is love. It’s easy to get lost in what you don’t have and not be grateful for what you do have. Take a few moments to reflect on the path of your closest relationships and how they developed over time. Use this information as a foundation to create positive change.

**Taurus Rising:**

Lately, when it comes to your day-to-day life, you have felt more positive about potential outcomes. You may have been conscientious about the food that you’re eating or negotiating with your boss for an increase in income.

This new moon falls in your 6th house of routines, health, and work. This is a chance for you to have a fresh start in regards to your daily habits, if you haven’t already done so. This can be a great time to tidy up your workspace, put some houseplants around you that help purify the air (just make sure they’re safe for any pets you have), or hang up pictures of your loved ones. It’s about making yourself comfortable so you can be more productive.

And if you are in a romantic relationship, this is a great time to take some action in regards to communication of responsibilities. Or, if there’s a balance between work and life, go out with some other couples to a local spot that you find warm and inviting. Conversations can flow and be dynamic or enlightening.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Think about what would be the most harmonious routine you can stick to without much effort or interference from the other people you share space with. Sometimes it’s the little things that make our life easier, like food prepping for the week, switching to instant coffee, or small hacks such as brushing your teeth while you’re taking a shower. Once you know two or three things that can make some positive changes, work on implementing them into your life.

**Gemini Rising:**

You’ve most likely been feeling quite creative lately. You may have picked up a brush dripping with paint, written a song, or pursued some other creative outlet. You’ve been quite busy handling work responsibilities and taking action with the details.

With the Libra new moon in your 5th house, you may gain some insight on a project you are working on and have a breakthrough. You may even decide to start over on something after gaining clarity or being inspired by a muse. You also could be feeling quite flirty lately.

You could be focused on your personal values in a grand way or investing in educational pursuits. You may be more optimistic about your long-term pursuits, and this new moon could provide additional information about implementation.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** This is a time to think about what brings joy and bliss into your life. If you are not in a loving relationship, this is a great time to manifest that into your life. Just remember, you need to love yourself completely first, and when you do, you will open the door to meeting someone special. And as a side note, you need to be out and about with other people in order to meet that person.

**Cancer Rising:**

The past week you’ve been tidying up your home and getting creative ideas on how to decorate your space. You also may be publishing articles, writing a book, creating coursework, or learning something new.

With the new moon in your 4th house, you may be reframing your thoughts about your family and childhood and how those relationships have played out over the years. Though some of these themes could be sensitive, with love and forgiveness, you may be able to see some of the dynamics in a different light as opposed to a power struggle or a test of wills.

Sometimes to move through the past we have to create an environment that reflects who we are now. You may have a desire to change out pictures that are in frames or hang up artwork that has deep personal meaning. You also may be gearing up for a long-distance trip, quite possibly to a place where you’ve lived before.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** This would be a good time to think about the people who have hurt you, especially family members or those from your younger years. Instead of thinking about the hurt and pain, and if you are emotionally ready, imagine them in a positive light and frame them as your supporters rather than your detractors. This meditation can help shift the energy between you and those memories that are holding you back from your authentic and loving self.

**Leo Rising:**

I would not be surprised if, in the past week, you’ve driven by a playground and felt an urge to get out of your car and jump on one of the swings or climb on the jungle gym. You could be longing for a simpler time, where you knew everyone in the neighborhood and an experience was right around the corner.

With the new moon in your 3rd house, this is a great time to focus on the peace and harmony you’d like in your neighborhood. You may be inspired to throw a block party or do some sort of community outreach. There may be a realization of how disconnected you’ve been from those around you and a desire to reconnect.

There is a chance you are thinking about relocating or changing your residence. You could also be considering doing renovations around your home. This is the time to think optimistically but also ensure that you cover each detail and create a solid plan that can be executed.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** During the new moon, think about how you made friends as a child. You most likely had friends who came from different cultures, whose families had different ideas or belief systems than yours, yet you were able to find commonality with each other. Ask yourself if you’ve lost that ability to connect to people who are different from you, and if so, how can you create friendships like you did when you were young.

**Virgo Rising:**

There’s a possibility that your boss is floating the idea of increasing your pay, or you could have recently had a bump in income. You may have been making a concerted effort to be with your friends or join a social group or cause.

With the new moon in your 2nd house, you may be reevaluating your own personal values. Finding balance may be a priority for you right now. You also could be surrounding yourself with pretty things and displaying your prized collections.

When it comes to your community, you may have a desire to take on more responsibility in maintaining relationships. Spending time at your local coffee shop and making new friends or attending local events such as fairs, concerts, or art and craft shows can give you a sense of belonging.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** With the influence of Libra, what are the things that bring you peace and personal fulfillment? If your home is filled with things that weigh you down, maybe it’s time to sell them so you can fill your space with the things that bring you joy. Or this could be a reflection about the people in your life and whether you are valuing them as much as you love them.

**Libra Rising:**

Lately, you’ve been focused on your appearance and how you project yourself to the outside world. Though you embrace harmony, you’ve been in a much more peaceful mood lately. You may have mentioned to someone how you feel more balanced, especially when it comes to work and responsibility.

With the new moon, this is a great time to reset your boundaries. This doesn’t mean you need to have conflict with others but instead maintain the sense of well-being that you’re having right now. What can you do to prolong this feeling of peace and satisfaction? It is okay to put yourself first, and that’s what the Libra new moon in your 1st house is reminding you to do.

And as a reminder, it is okay to put those boundaries in place at work. You are most likely someone who not only does your own work but also takes on roles that are not assigned to you. You don’t have to be the only one who picks up the slack. Though it feels great that everyone wants your expertise, just remember that it’s also okay to gently remind them what your actual responsibilities are and that you’re taking care of those first.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Look at the times in the past that led to you being overwhelmed and overworked. You may say yes and underestimate the length of time certain projects will take or that one question could lead to many more. Though saying no may be difficult for you, how would things play out if you said maybe or I don’t know as opposed to yes?

**Scorpio Rising:**

You may have had a mental reprieve lately, feeling much more connected to spirit or tapping into your own private sanctuary. You may have taken action by writing in a journal or expressing your thoughts to make sense of the harmonious feelings you are experiencing.

With a new moon in your 12th house, this is the perfect time for meditation, yoga, breath work, prayer, chanting, or any other spiritual activity that brings you peace and understanding. If you can go to a crystal bowl sound bath, you could start a new spiritual journey that changes your everyday thoughts.

You may have had some blocks recently in regards to your creativity, though that doesn’t mean you haven’t had a lot of big ideas. The blocks have more to do with how to implement those ideas. This is why meditation can open up a door of taking ownership of mind, body, and soul.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** The flow of water can liberate you from your rut. Whether you take a swim in the ocean, float in a pool, or take a long shower, use these actions to help you tap into your higher self. This is a great time to do some automatic writing, meditative journaling, or deep discussions with a close confidant. Just let yourself be open to the experience rather than being focused on one particular thing.

**Sagittarius Rising:**

You’ve been a social butterfly lately, enjoying the company of friends, whether new ones or those you’ve been close to for years. If you haven’t gone to a concert recently, there’s a good chance you’ve been looking at upcoming shows and may have even bought tickets.

With the new moon in your 11th house, you could be thinking about what it means to be a friend and what you desire from your friendships. You may also be thinking about how you could be more engaged in social causes, especially those that relate to your belief system or your sense of freedom and justice. Regardless, friendship and community are where you’re feeling balanced and hopeful.

You could be dealing with some family matters right now and may have to step into responsibility, especially with a parent or grandparent. You may need to find resources for them and take action for their health and well-being.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Friendships may come and go, but understanding the importance of your connections with other people is how we create a society that benefits everyone. Take this time to visualize a utopian world, and as you do so, imagine light around every person on earth and the connective thread between all of us.

**Capricorn Rising:**

Work has been quite harmonious lately for you, and your relationship with your boss has probably been the best it’s been in a while. There’s a great chance that you’ve been networking lately and meeting new connections to help you grow in your career.

With the new moon in your 10th house, this could be a good time to create a strategy for getting a raise or taking on a new role. You may want to take the next few days and write out all of your accomplishments, especially those that display your contributions to the team and how well you work with your teammates.

If you and your romantic partner have not been out on a date lately, this is a great time to do so. This could be a romantic and nurturing time for the two of you, and you may even explore activities like tango dancing or playful outings. You don’t have to go too far out of your comfort zone to have fun; just make sure the two of you are on the same page and feel safe.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Focus on your dream career and how you want to be known for the work that you do. How can you have a work environment that is peaceful yet productive, harmonious yet profitable? Understanding that you can bring balance into the trajectory of your career can help you achieve your goals without frustration.

**Aquarius Rising:**

Have you been thinking about going to a retreat or vacation? You could be yearning for a place to unwind and relax. You may have a desire to visit museums, especially ones that host art or cultural artifacts.

With the Libra new moon in your 9th house, a change of scenery may do you good. You don’t necessarily have to travel far, but going somewhere new, especially somewhere that expands your mind or gives you an appreciation for another culture, could be a great way to add equilibrium to your life.

Work has been quite busy for you, and your day-to-day tasks are keeping you hopping. You’re happy that the days are going fast, but you crave something different to do. You may also have had extra responsibilities added to your workload or needed to give a presentation about your department’s successes or challenges.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Take the time to gain a new perspective on diversity in the world. Esoterically, you understand that we all have many similarities. However, understanding and appreciating the differences can show you how the world balances itself by hosting a variety of beliefs, cultures, and practices.

**Pisces Rising:**

There may have been a recent increase of income for you or your partner. If neither of you has received a raise, you may want to check out your investments or the value of your property. Even if your finances are doing well, you may want to ensure that your portfolio is balanced and schedule an appointment with a financial advisor to keep the surplus intact.

With the new moon in your 8th house, it is about your joint resources. You may want to beautify any property that you own. If you have family heirlooms or antiques, consider having insurance on them or keeping them in a safe place.

You could feel like you are carrying the weight on your shoulders when it comes to practical matters, something that you’re not the most comfortable doing. However, taking responsibility now can help you prepare for the immediate future. If you have children, you most likely have been in deep conversations with them and could be thinking about your legacy and what you will pass down someday.

**Meditate or Reflect on:** Thinking about the past and times of turmoil can actually help you find balance in your current situation. Throughout life, we tend to have highs and lows. Unfortunately, we rarely prepare for the lows while enjoying the highs. Since you may have had many blessings recently, saving for a rainy day or even a drought can help you through rough times. Ask for guidance from professionals if needed; otherwise, write out a personal plan that can bring you a sense of peace and practicality.

# Recap on the Current Energy and Final Thoughts

The world is going through great change due to the cycles of the outer planets. These are not the easiest of times, but the new moon in Libra is teaching us that we can find different ways to create our own sense of harmony and balance. The key here is to accept that the times are changing.

Now, does this mean you have to accept injustices or unlawful acts? No, it does not. But clutching onto the past will not aid you in your journey. Think of the hermit crab leaving its prior shell. Perhaps the crab discovers that someone damaged its new shell or that it wasn’t what it thought it would be. Going back to the old, cramped, and useless shell would not be the best decision. Instead, our little friend would be best served to have vision and reimagine another shell or home, and take residence in something it hasn’t yet experienced.

Some astrologers paint the future as bleak. Others think we are all going to ascend to another dimension. Personally, I don’t see either. But it takes all of us to envision something that fits our current times and considers how we can have peace and greater equity.

So where do we start? Starting with ourselves is the first step. When we are emotionally, mentally, and physically balanced, we can make the best decisions going forth. It is difficult to cause harm to others when you genuinely love yourself and that love overflows to the rest of the world. Embrace your values and visualize a shell that can fit the entire world in comfort, peace, love, and understanding.

Next step feels like roasting, but I’m wondering if there’s anything that is just stupid easy. Set it up, dial in and then push a button, let it do its thing, type thing.

In law roasts their own coffee, uses a Behmer, seems easy enough but the “have to be there to push on again after x minutes or it’ll just turn off” and listening for first crack are things that will be challenging with the chaos our home can contain.

I drink 12oz a week, am OK doing 1-2 batches a week, but would like a set up and forget type experience.

1oacv98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oacv98,Building Blackjack Flash - A polished Blackjack game built natively for Apple Watch,"**Context**

Like many of you, I'm an Apple Watch enthusiast. I’ve owned an Apple Watch since 2018, and I’ve always felt that most apps and games on watchOS were… well, afterthoughts. Either companion apps or stripped-down demos.

As a Software Engineering student, I wanted to put my skills to use and build something actually designed for the Watch — quick, satisfying, and designed for the small screen.

That’s how **Blackjack Flash** was born.

**Why Blackjack?**

A hand lasts only 5–20 seconds — which I believe is perfect for the wrist. No one sits down to “game for hours” on an Apple Watch, but a short hand of blackjack? That works.

When I checked the App Store, most watch Blackjack games were either bland or paywalled right away. So I spent the last 3 months building a high-quality, **watch-first** blackjack experience.

**“Why would I play Blackjack on a watch, or better yet, why would I spend 1$ on Premium instead of my coffee?”**

* Quality animations optimized for the watch display
* Over **70 unlockable cosmetics** — card faces, card backs, table themes, and win animations
* **Haptic feedback** that feels great on each deal
* A **clean, intuitive UI** that doesn’t feel cramped
* 60+ Achievements to unlock alongside their coin rewards
* Progression/Statistics systems

**Betting...**

Now before you throw tomatoes at me, let me briefly explain why there is no simulated betting system. I did in fact build an entire betting system with chips, a bankroll, and related unlocks... only to have Apple reject it because simulated gambling isn't allowed for individual developer accounts.

I had to scrap arguably my proudest feature. However, I did make up for it with coin rewards when you do win, giving a new meaningful winning satisfaction.

**Free vs Premium**

**Free Version (v1.1)**

* Play up to **20 hands per day** (resets daily) -NOTE: As of writing, v1.1 is in App Review and should be released within 48hrs. Previous version 1.0.2 had a limit of 10 hands per day
* Access a limited shop and a few cosmetics
* Earn coins through gameplay

**Premium ($0.99)**

* **Unlimited hands** — play as much as you want
* Full access to achievement and progression/statistics systems
* Complete shop access with all 70+ cosmetics
* Earn coins through gameplay

**Monetization**

As you can expect, developing apps for the Apple Watch is extremely tedious and time consuming. I'm on a mission to keep developing quality apps for the Apple Watch, but I can't do it for free and needed to implement monetization somewhere.

I hate paid apps that don't offer a way to try the app before making a purchase, that's why I made the app free with in-app purchases. This allows users to try it first — then decide. I did my best to provide a great experience for free users, and I figured the 0.99$ Premium price tag is very accessible for everyone.

**Looking for Feedback**

As this is my first app, I'd genuinely love your honest feedback! You can find my app here: [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/blackjack-flash/id6748754932](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/blackjack-flash/id6748754932)

*   Does the UI feel intuitive on your wrist?
*   Is 10-20 hands a day enough to evaluate the app, or too stingy?
*   What would make you keep playing vs. deleting?

I hope you all enjoy my app! Any feedback is welcome!",4,1760836436.0,AppleWatch,1,0.75,False
1oacups,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oacups/to_those_who_avoid/,to those who avoid,"Okay, I was with my boyfriend for about eight months. We met in college and it was really the sweetest getting-to-know-you story ever.  However, after a good six months things changed. At first it gave me a lot of confirmation. He made small gestures, gave me little things or wrote that he would miss me or something like that. However, things got a little more stressful for him with university and I noticed that his energy towards me had also changed. I knew that time was a little more limited and I didn't expect much, especially not as much as at the beginning. However, I noticed that I received much less validation and attention. A kind of distance built up between us. We didn't talk much. I tried to have conversations, but he blocked them or they were very short and superficial. You have to say about my boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend, that he comes from very difficult family circumstances. His father was an alcoholic and beat his mother. He never saw his stepfather as a son. Both died, also quite close to each other. The father also ended up with cancer. As a result, he had the problem that he could never really say that he loved me. He never said I love you and could never say those words in general. He told me that I was the first person in his life that I could ever miss, and told me about his fears and that I wouldn't take it so seriously with him. That was all, but at the beginning before that stressful phase at university. But I also became more insecure with him. I questioned a lot and often, when he was calmer and thoughtful, asked what was going on. That annoyed him, which led to arguments because he usually always said that nothing was going on and, as a rule, there really was nothing going on. But he was just a quiet type of person, but somehow because of this waning attention I no longer felt so loved - my insecurities become distant with you. 
he was overwhelmed by my insecurities. At first he tried really hard to continue to reassure me. At some point I realized that he didn't feel like it either. I often even suggested solutions and put a pen and paper on the table so that everyone could write down their problems. However, he has never had such great motivation to implement anything on his part. Then he was away for work for a month. At first we agreed that we would visit each other. However, after the arguments increased, he told me in a conversation that I should use these four weeks to concentrate on myself, to pursue my hobbies, so that I can find my old personality again, who feels that I was no longer the same as I was at the beginning because of all the insecurities. I tried to take this advice, but I felt extremely bad while he was away. He contacted me sporadically, answered immediately, but I had the feeling that it wasn't hurtful on his part or that it was just superficial. After four weeks he came back. Slept with me and when I asked him about why he changed his phone wallpaper and it hurt me because I felt like he was hiding me at work or wouldn't show me to other people when he was out of town. I also asked him that he had met an old friend who had feelings for him and said that I thought it was stupid that he had kept that a secret from me. Then I was in tears. So when I wanted to talk to him and tell him, when he came back that I had been feeling extremely badly for four weeks, he told me that he had noticed that I wasn't happy in the relationship and, above all, that I wasn't as happy as I was before the relationship, and said that the relationship wasn't doing me any good. I then asked but wanted to break up. He doesn't answer for a long time and then says yes. When I asked him if he still loved me or if he was the last few months he said yes again and still. But the cycle between us never ends. then I hug him again. We kiss again and I told him I didn't understand his reasons. He said he had already explained it to me, I left and said weak reasons, baby. Three days later I saw him again because he brought his keys. He looked very exhausted and when I asked him how he was doing he said it was fine. 
However, I really wanted to talk to him again a few days later and try to talk about protein again so that we could try it again. I had that too, but in the conversation he was completely different than before. This was about a week after the breakup. He seemed very selfish and very closed, had given his reasons again and said that he couldn't imagine trying that again. When I asked if there could be a future for him between us at some point, he said no and that I should put an end to it, then I wanted to cry and kiss him again. He said no and that I should make it even harder for him than it already is, then I left. We were no longer in contact. Until Monday that was about a month and a half of no contact. I saw him on Monday and I just picked up my clothes. We talked briefly. He asked if I would like to come in for a moment. Really very self-confident in the conversation, or at least trying to be, but the conversation came more from my side. I ask questions all the time about how he's doing, what he's doing, how university and work are going and he doesn't ask any questions about my information. When I left, I asked whether he could imagine us meeting for a relaxed coffee in the near future or whether he wanted to go completely no contact. He said we could meet for coffee. I'm just wondering now with the whole story. Based on experience. What is it like guys really finished after such a time. Could it be that he really could never love, even if he first said, what else do I love? And how could he have closure so quickly when he himself had feelings about the breakup? I know the mistakes I've made in a relationship towards the end, not direct mistakes, but I've often tried to get his attention by being a bit toxic and trying to make him jealous through the attention of other guys. I never meant it in a bad way. It was more of a kind of emergency act when everything was going so badly and I so desperately longed for his attention. And I wonder if things would have been different if I hadn't done that or if I had given him more freedom. But most of the time I wonder how an avoidant boy feels about such a situation, even if it doesn't really concern me anymore.",0,1760836391.0,BreakUps,0,0.5,False
