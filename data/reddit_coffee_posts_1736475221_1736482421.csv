I’m looking to expand my social circle with some genuine connections (or as close as you can get from posting on Reddit lol), so here's a little bit about me:

I’m an East Coast-based, city-dwelling introvert here. I'm a homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being childfree—doing what I want, when I want (even if that's nothing at all!): curling up with a good book, occasional gaming sessions, binge-watching shows, planning my next vacation spot, trying new recipes or perfecting old favorites, hanging out with my two cats, and taking quality naps. 

While I can be outgoing when necessary, I ultimately need my downtime to recharge. You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon—I prefer my adventures in or near civilization with air conditioning, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea.

So, yeah, that's the basic summary of me. I'm looking for like-minded people (preferably between 25-35) who are educated, kind, funny, and understand the value of genuine connections.

**Yearly Overview**: Mood tracker!! I'm using a 1-5 scale with 5 being excellent and 1 being poor. I chose to use numbers so I can take a mean score at the end of each month (and eventually the year) to see how my mood averages. The colors just make it look pretty.

**Monthly Spread**: I'm using my monthly spread for ""big goals"". Each goal has a color and I break the goal down into smaller, more easily accomplished tasks so that I don't get overwhelmed trying to do everything at once. For the month of January, my goals are to reset and organize my home, get my clothing collection under control, and finish publishing the research paper I've been working on. Each day has a task that works towards one of these goals and is color coded as such. I also throw things like meetings, appointments, and other plans onto this page so that I can reference it when I go to create my weekly spread! 

**Unused weeklys**: I started my planner the first week of January so I had 5 unused weekly spreads (last week of Nov + all of Dec). I used 1 weekly to do a ""swatch sheet"" because NOTHING is worse than picking the wrong color after slaving over a weekly spread for an hour+!! For the remaining 4, I chose to track the following ""activities"":

* Coffee shop visits (with ratings) - my goal is to visit at least one new coffee shop per month 
* Restaurant visits (+ a bucket list of resultants I'd like to try) - again, one new one per month
* Books I'm reading (shooting for at least 1 book per month) 
* Movies and tv shows I'm watching (this is just for fun & bc I can never remember the names when I want to tell someone about them, lol)

**Blank grids**: The hobonichi weeks has 73 blank pages so I've allocated them as follows: 

* Pages 1 - 12: Monthly budget. 1 page per month. Here I track my income streams, monthly expenses, and savings goals
* Pages 13 - 64: Weekly shopping lists. One page per week, includes a running list of groceries and home goods that I need along with the associated store. I generally update this starting the week prior and until the day I go shopping
* Pages 65 & 66 (Not pictured): ""Wants"". These are things I want but do not need. Like cute shoes or knick knacks. I keep this page because I find it helps me with impulse spending. When I have extra money to spend or am just in the mood to shop, I can browse through here and see if there are things I actually still want or if they were items I just thought were cool at the time. This one really helps me be more intentional about how I spend my money! 
* Pages 67 - 73: These ones are still unused!! Still deciding what I want to do with them, but thinking I'd like to turn them into mini collages of pictures from the year

1hxvwcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeikoMods/comments/1hxvwcn/regulating_a_movement/,Regulating a movement ,"Learning to regulate a movement.
 
Maybe these tips can help someone else, or perhaps someone can offer me advice, which I would humbly accept since I have no formal training and am self-taught. 

I couldn’t find any good videos on YouTube for regulating NH35 movements, so I learned through trial and error, spending hours adjusting the beat error and rate. Eventually, I developed my own system and achieved an accuracy of +/- 8 seconds a day or better. Here’s my method:

**The Basics**
1. Clean work area
2. Exceptional lighting
3. Magnification headset
4. Good tools
5. Coffee
6. Patience 

Here’s a breakdown of #'s 1-6 :

#1. **Clean Work Area **
#2 ** Exceptional Lighting**: 
These are self-explanatory.

#3. **Magnification**
 I had to experiment with several different types of visual magnification devices to find what worked for me. It varies for everyone.

#4. **Good Tools**
I didn’t like using a phone app, so I purchased a Weishei 1000 timegrapher machine. It was worth the $120. There are better machines out there, but my budget is limited. The Weishei 1000 doesn’t pick up background noise, the watch case holder is secure, and it allows for multiple positions to regulate the movement from various angles.
 For stability, I grasp the holder and watch case with my non-dominant hand while using my dominant hand to make adjustments with a pencil-shaped, hard plastic tool that has a small flathead screwdriver end. This tool is sturdy and won’t scratch the movement.

#5. **Coffee** 
By this, I mean that I need to be fully alert and laser-focused, without distractions, and not in a hurry, with steady and intentional hands.

**Using the Timegrapher** (Just the Basics for New Movements)

First, fully wind the movement; this will be shown as ""Amplitude"" on the timegrapher. Second, set the lift angle for the movement (you can look this up online). 

Next, observe the timegraph display to check the current status of the movement. At this point, I use my limited experience and knowledge to determine my starting point. Depending on what the graph displays, I might begin with either the beat error or the rate.

When I make adjustments, I press parallel to the movement, not perpendicular. In other words, I avoid pushing towards the hairspring. This way, if my tool slips, it won't damage the movement by jamming into the hairspring. 

I make micro-adjustments—smaller than micro-adjustments. Then, I watch the graph, sometimes for a moment and other times for several minutes. Sometimes I see immediate changes, while other times, the watch needs time to settle after the adjustment, taking a minute to level out.

#6 **Patience **
 This could take a while. 
I have gotten faster with practice, 30 minutes to an hour is an average time for me to regulate a movement.

when we met at a party we just hit it off instantly and ended up making out a lot, she stayed at my flat and slept in my bed with me, but nothing happened other than just kissing.

we keep talking after this and realise that we have a lot in common and like each other quite a bit, so I invite her out on a date.

we had said date yesterday and it went really well, we met at a coffee shop at 2pm, got kicked out at 4pm because it shut and went back to hers until 7:30pm.

it was a really good date, we just talked so much, there was never really any awkward silence.

when it ended, she said goodbye and gave me a hug, and invited me out again on a night out with her friends tomorrow.

I'm trying to figure out what this means, as I'd take this as she wants me to make a move, but we kinda talked about sex before and agreed that we didn't want that to be the core of our relationship 

I remember her actually saying on text once when we were flirting back and forth that if I tried anything when she was planning to show me her flat she'd kick me out ;)

but I've been to her flat now, and I'm kinda confused, does she want me to make a move? or does she still not want that. it's so hard for me to tell

I’m not sure if this is a good place to post this, I posted something similar in travel partners as well but it seems a bit dead there. 

I’m a Canadian girl looking for someone to travel with. Basically, I’ll be heading to Australia (Perth) around the 11th or 13th of March to attend a wedding. I will leave Perth on March 25th or so, and head to Sydney. At this point I have no solid plan but I do have some ideas of things I want to do and would love to either meet up with someone who might want to show me around / travel with me or maybe you’re not even from Australia but might want to go to Australia or meet me there to have someone to explore with.


A bit about me:
- 33F from Toronto, Canada
- petite, brunette, active / slim
- some of my interests are music, dogs / animals, fitness, yoga, matcha, coffee, art, fashion
- I’m friendly, easy to talk to, get along well with most people 
- I don’t smoke or do drugs, would appreciate the same


If any of this sounds interesting to you then I’d love to hear from you.


Just to add, I’m not looking for hookups. I am single and straight, so I wouldn’t rule out anything, but that’s not my main goal here and would hope that there are no expectations. I’d just really like to find someone (or people) to spend some days travelling with while in Australia. I did consider maybe NZ as well, but I also don’t want to go alone, so that could be an option still. ",1,1736481560.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

While the layers aren’t perfect, I’m thrilled with how it turned out!

The flavours are *divine*, and it was surprisingly easy to make! Part of that was due to using a really awesome recipe - which had a video I could use for reference if needed (I’ll post in the comments).

From top to bottom, this cake has a chocolate croustillant base, layers of coffee syrup soaked almond jaconde sponge, coffee buttercream, and chocolate ganache, topped with a chocolate glaze.

I even made my own paillette feuilletine for the croustillant base! It was super easy and really took the whole dessert up a notch.

I also added some to the second layer of French buttercream, which broke up the soft textures really nicely. 

The only snag I ran into was with the sponge. I only had one correctly sized pan, so I could only bake one sheet at a time. I realized this right before I was going to bake, so in my haste, I forgot to add the melted butter! 

Thankfully I realized before I baked both sheets and was able to add it to the second batch! I think this is why the bottom layer of sponge got so squished (as evidenced by the teeeeeny layer). 

Even though I was intimidated by this recipe, I really enjoyed making it.

I eat out. I do everything!

Because I'm bigger than it! And I know mine isn't as bad as some people's. I have my days. Sometimes I do have nightmares or worried about when it'll happen.

They embody the principles of minimizing costs, reducing risk, and leveraging market efficiency. Let me break this down, but first, let’s clarify what “game theory” means.

# What is Game Theory?

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. Initially applied to zero-sum games, where one player's gain equals another's loss, it has since expanded to non-zero-sum games and those with ""imperfect information,"" like poker.

The other common example is the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw&ab_channel=ThisPlace). This gave rise to the concept of 'Game Theory Optimal' (GTO) strategies such as in Poker (explained in this video [GTO Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx0iJ7h_b8o&ab_channel=FindingEquilibrium), which aim to minimize losses regardless of opponents' actions. This led to the development of multiple Poker AI which beat the majority of professional players in heads-up Poker discussed in this podcast: [Poker AI vs. Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oHH4aClJQs&ab_channel=LexFridmanwhich). However, in investing, GTO is about maximizing risk-adjusted returns, not just minimizing risk.

# How Does This Relate to the Stock Market and ETFs?

The concept of *Nash equilibrium* is crucial here. In a Nash equilibrium, players make optimal decisions considering others’ actions, and no one can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. For example, imagine two coffee shops on the same street. If both set prices such that neither gains more customers or profit by adjusting their price alone, they’re in a Nash equilibrium. Here is a video showcasing this in action: [Simulating Supply and Demand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&ab_channel=Primer).

An example in the stock market, similar dynamics occur where participants (buyers, sellers, and investors) interact in the market. If an investor buys an undervalued stock and its price rises to reflect its true value, the market eventually reaches equilibrium. At this point, buyers have no incentive to pay more, and sellers see no benefit in lowering their price, as the stock is now fairly valued. This balance persists until new information or external factors disrupt the market dynamics.

# The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

The 'efficient market hypothesis' is a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all available information and consistent alpha generation is impossible. 'Alpha' is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its “edge.” Many state that the market behaves this way and approaches an 'efficient market' behaviour such that 'alpha' approaches an asymptote of zero. This is explained well in this video: [Ben Felix - Is The Market Efficient?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix)

['Factor investing'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTnIebSzj4&ab_channel=BenFelix), such as tilting towards small-cap stocks for their historical premium, can theoretically improve absolute returns. However, these 'factor premiums' come with additional risk, which may not be proportional to their returns. Moreover, as more investors adopt such strategies, their effectiveness diminishes due to crowding. Efficient markets ensure that higher returns at a cheaper price are compensation for higher risk, but they're not a “free lunch.” They are explained in the linked video.

Studies by Fama and French conducting backtesting of data, show that most returns come from market beta, which accounts for >80% of returns (which captures overall market movement), while factors (such as value, momentum, profit and size) contribute the remaining \~18% and 1-2% remains unaccounted for without inclusion of other factors or human behaviour. This is mentioned at 2 mins in by Rick Ferri in this video: [The Case Against Factor Investing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_MFyltNt4)

As an example: tilting toward smaller companies (e.g., small-cap weighting) is based on the small-cap premium hypothesis which is based on the 'size' factor. This is from the observation that historically, smaller companies have delivered higher returns than larger companies, i.e. the small-cap 'premium'. However, these premiums necessarily come with more risk and are not 'free' by increasing risk-adjusted returns with no consequence. Because no 'free lunch' exists; you can’t gain higher returns without taking on proportionate or higher than proportionate risks. As such, higher risk does not translate into higher risk-adjusted returns, only higher absolute returns to compensate for their risks. Passive ETFs guarantee the market at low cost.

# Why ETFs Are GTO ('Game Theory' Optimal):

ETFs provide market-average returns (beta) at low cost, avoiding the risks and expenses of active management. As markets become more efficient, alpha opportunities shrink, and active strategies yield diminishing returns and attempting to seek alpha results in reduced risk-adjusted returns.. Passive strategies, therefore, dominate by capturing an efficient or near efficient market's return whilst maximising risk-adjusted returns by minimizing unnecessary risk and fees.

# Caveats to consider:

Real-world markets aren’t perfect:

1. There is imperfect Information. Not all participants have full access to accurate information, leading to inefficiencies. Some participants have more information than others. However, we are assuming there is no Nancy Pelosi or insider trading going on.
2. There is diversity and lack of heterogeneity. Risk preferences, time horizons, and available resources vary among investors. Many are subject to behavioural biases.
3. Market dynamics are ever present. Although the market is usually quick to price this in, changing economic conditions, policy decisions, and external shocks, can disrupt equilibrium states.

# Active vs. Passive Investors:

Active investors play a role in price discovery, correcting mispricings by buying undervalued assets or selling overvalued ones. Yet, as alpha becomes harder to find, passive strategies gain appeal. Over time, as markets become more efficient, a Nash equilibrium forms between active and passive investors. The more efficient the market, the tougher it is for active investors to outperform without assuming disproportionate risk. In stock trading, buyers and sellers anticipate each other’s decisions, leading to equilibrium prices where supply matches demand. If the 'efficient market hypothesis' is valid for the stock market, this means that stocks are correctly priced for their risk and the market generally behaves this way. Does this not imply that a 'passive' market-cap-weighted portfolio (i.e. buying the market) represents a game theory optimal strategy by definition?

In actuality, passive investors are a very small portion of the market, however the more passive investors there are, the more active investors attempt to seek 'alpha' are rewarded who help stabilise price discovery. Where active investors are identifying and correcting mispricing in the market by buying undervalued assets or selling overvalued ones (by assuming more risk). This assumes that 'alpha' gets larger as less active investors seek to capitalise on it with new information and as a consequence this price discovery ensures that 'factors' such as 'value' are priced appropriately given their excess risk.

In a market where risk is always present and returns are not guaranteed, minimising risk while capturing the returns of the market is the dominant strategy. ETFs achieve this through diversification based on market-cap weighting, whilst active investors take on unnecessary risk in the hope of outperforming. As more active investors are enter the market and hypothetically only 3/10 active investors get rewarded for seeking alpha,  this eventually becomes 1/10 investors who outperform the index. This  then eventually favour passive investors as they receive optimised risk-adjusted returns, as there they are assuming less risk as assets eventually become appropriately priced as 'alpha' approaches zero. This will then lead to its own 'Nash equilibrium' then with passive investors and active investors. Although if we are the believe that market are indeed efficient and that markets incorporate information quickly, there is little room for active investors to find 'alpha' without taking on disproportionate risk. The more efficient the market, the harder it is for active investors to outperform, despite employing the more aggressive strategy. This particular Nash Equillibrium is similar to this video:  [Simulating the Evolution of Aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w&ab_channel=Primer). Therefore, ETFs are dominant because they align with the market’s average and avoid the cost of failed attempts to beat it by copying the market sentiment (i.e. buying the proverbial 'haystack').

# Active Management Risks and Fees

The asset management industry may exploit inefficiencies to generate alpha, but their fees and payment structure usually mean that they don't end up passing on meaningful benefits to investors after using their money to take on more risk. Rather, it seems to be going to the fund managers themselves, unless they significantly outperform the market over time. However, that is not to mention the added risk involved of doing so depending on their strategy. As an example of the above, I have a mate who invests in an actively managed fund of around 20-30 stocks which charges 1-2% fee as well as a performance fee (20% of returns), so they are the one pocketing all the 'alpha' in excess of market returns. Strategies like HFT quant shops may unintentionally contribute to price efficiency by addressing short-term market imbalances, even if that isn’t their primary aim and aren't tied to intrinsic value analysis or fundamentals.

# The Bottom Line

""In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine."" - Benjamin Graham. Where, in the short term, prices are driven by market sentiment and in the long-term 'reversion to the mean' helps uncover the true intrinsic ""value"" of a company.

As a consequence, active more aggressive strategies (including stock-picking and timing the market) becomes a short-term strategy like day-trading and passive indexing becomes a more reliable strategy suited towards long-term investing and is ideal 'game theory optimal' strategy.

Passive and diversified broad-index funds or ETFs represent a game-theory optimal (GTO) approach to investing in real-world markets. They embody the principles of minimizing costs, reducing risk, and leveraging market efficiency. Let me break this down, but first, let’s clarify what “game theory” means.

# What is Game Theory?

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. Initially applied to zero-sum games, where one player's gain equals another's loss, it has since expanded to non-zero-sum games and those with ""imperfect information,"" like poker. This is a clip from [A beautiful mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xe9U0D9xY8&ab_channel=BingeSociety) which show cases a crude example of a type of game theory strategy.

***(B)(S)(F)***

**GO!**

Maddock had just left the shower and jumped to his room with only a half towel around his waist when his phone went off. It was another message from Karma with a countdown and several incendiary emojis for the date in a few hours. He was happy to admit that he was feeling something other than despair, even if that emotion was panic and desperation. Cardinal had lent him some cologne and Spaz had made sure to iron out his clothes for the evening while Raine and Elbee had promised to take patrols for the night. He took a breath as he got into his clothes and looked at his centuries old vest that he had last worn when the west of America was wild and he had first met the crazy bastard that was Smiles, who would become the Revenant of Avarice. He shuddered and pushed that thought to the back of his mind, he couldn’t let that psychopath live in his head anymore.

He put the vest down and instead grabbed a new jacket that Spaz had suggested. Like most things of his, it was green, he had always liked the color and preferred it on most of his things. This still hadn’t ever gotten him linked to being the Wraith and he was still confused as to why. He quickly got dressed and rushed to the kitchen to prepare a cup of coffee, but as he stepped foot out of the hall a bolt of electricity spat Elbee out into their living room. The young revenant screamed in agony and Maddock’s heart went into free fall as he warped through the shadow’s to his younger brother’s side.

“What’s wrong, _deartháir_!” Maddock pulled his brother up and watched his brother’s left arm flop around as his bones weren’t there.

“Goddammnit.” Elbee shrieked. “Stupid Rabbit!” 

“The Mercenary, the speedy one?” Maddock asked as he lifted his brother and carried him to his bed. “Who?” 

“The crazy creature!” Elbee hissed, “He had so many weapons...” 

Maddock sat his brother on his bed. “Rest, don’t move, let your power heal it.” 

“I have been for ten minutes!” Elbee snapped. “It won’t heal!” 

«_Leathchúpla_.» Maddock pushed the call to his sister and in a flash she was in the room, walking through a shadow he had sent for her. 

“Oh god...” Raine pulled back her hood and her armor and cloak flowed and pulsed as it vanished back into her body. “What happened?” 

“March-Hare.” Maddock said darkly as shadows twisted around him and donned his cloak and hood upon him once more. “Keep an eye on him, I’m going to get answers.” 

Raine nodded, “Stay sane.” 

“This isn’t the curse. This is your brother protecting his family.” Maddock stepped back into a shadow and vanished.

“Did he seem different to you?” Elbee hissed. “Like...” He opened his mouth to scream, but silenced himself, “... like I was all that mattered.” 

“You are _deartháir_, at this moment, you are.” Raine sat down and helped her brother out of his own armor and gear.

**---B)(S)(F---**

Maddock watched the darkness in the city, he couldn’t directly sense March-Hare as the insane thing drove the dead away from him. Even spirits that wanted vengeance refused to gather around him and that left Maddock without any real leads to follow, so he had to search far and wide over the city. He found himself racing over the rooftops trying to catch a glimpse of anything that could give him a clue. Pain was all he saw in the city and he could feel his curse welling up, but he forced it back down, his brother was in danger and he had to do something.

Then gunfire broke through the night. He wanted to ignore it, but he heard a distant voice shout out curses. It was a voice he hadn’t heard in ages, at least a couple of hundred years. His feet carried him to the sounds of fighting and he perched over a Revenant decked out in guns with a bandana covering his face, a twisted smile painted over the rather loose disguise, it was Smiles. The other combatant was March-Hare and the mad freak was wielding a flintlock pistol that Maddock recognized all too quickly. 

He dropped silently next to Smiles who was reloading a rifle. The revenant quickly spun on him and stopped as his eyes widened in joy.

“Maddy!” Smiles laughed, “Good to see you.” 

“We aren’t friends.” Maddock growled, “But as always we seem to have a common enemy.”

“What’d...” A chunk of his cover was blown away and Smiles quickly moved away. “What’d he do to you?” 

“He hurt my brother and it’s not healing.” Maddock said. 

“Gunshot?” Smiles asked.

Maddock shook his head.

“Damn, can’t help there then. Bastard stole my weapon so be careful.” Smiles chuckled, “Your pa’s fine by the way.”

“I’ll deal with him later.” Maddock leaned around a corner and watched a chunk of it explode. “His aim is terrible.” 

“By all accounts he’s a better melee fighter.” Smiles nodded. “Say, you help me get my baby back and he’s all yours.” 

“I’ll go high. Try not to kill him please.” Maddock sighed as he vanished into the shadows and popped out behind the mad hybrid and sent him sailing from his hiding spot. 

As the hybrid man sailed under a series of broken ceiling and rafters, Maddock appeared above him and grabbed him by the legs and flung him through a shattered roof. Then as March-Hare rose into the sky Maddock was directly under him and put the hybrid into a sleeper hold as they plunged back to the ground. A single shot rang out and Maddock felt the hybrid go slack. They landed with a thud and Smiles traipsed over.

“Damnit, I wasn’t going for a headshot!” Smiles snarled as he bent down to grab his pistol.

As Smiles did so, Maddock felt the body kick back to life and tried to hold it strong. Smiles managed to stumble back but not before his pistol was tossed to the other side of the room along with Maddock. Smiles gave a barking laugh as he ran after both his prizes.

Maddock rolled and grabbed the old flintlock pistol as he skipped along the floor. He stood and Smiles was running at him. The Revenant of Avarice’s eye lit up as he jumped for the pistol, but Maddock moved away faster as he met the other Revenant’s gaze.

“We work together to stop him, he’s dangerous.” Maddock said sharply, “Then you can have it back.” 

Smiles held his fingers over his mask to make a frown, but then nodded, “Fine, Maddy. You want him captured, or down?” 

“You hit his brain. I don’t think he stays down long. But, I need him to stay still long enough for a chat.” Maddock nodded.

Smiles pulled down his bandana to reveal a real smile, “Oh, I got what the doctor ordered. Get him focused on you. Like really focused, this is a dart gun.” 

Maddock nodded.

“Hey, where’s your shadows?” Smiles asked, nodding to Maddock’s hood. 

“This isn’t the curse. This is me. The big brother. Maddock.” Maddock said as he stepped forward and through a shadow and delivered a hay-maker to March-Hare as a surprise attack. 

March-Hare glared and countered with a swift sweeping claw that dug into Maddock’s face. For a moment Maddock felt blood roll down his face, then it quickly healed as shadows passed over him while he spun and dodged his foe. He grabbed a dagger from his side and dropped it before he kicked it directly into the calf of the hybrid.

March-Hare rolled and grasped at the dagger, trying to pull it out the blackened dagger. It seemed glued to him and refused to budge.

“That is the dagger named The Wages of Sin. It is death and it can only be removed by me.” Maddock said as he stalked closer, and drew out a dagger with a white grip and a much sleeker design. “This is The Beckoning of Mercy, she ends the guilty who have accepted...” He paused and looked at the dagger trying to place in his mind when he had last used it.

“Don’t care!” March-Hare took his claws and ripped out the flesh that the dark dagger had been buried in and tossed it back at Maddock. 

Maddock merely caught his blade with ease and without looking, then glared at the hybrid.

“You harmed a revenant earlier this night. He is young in appearance.” Maddock snarled, “What did you do to him?” 

“This is about Tweedle-dumb, you must be Tweedle-dee!” March-Hare laughed, “Then again all of you are just oysters waiting for the end...” 

“What are you on about?” Maddock asked in confusion.

“It doesn’t matter, you won’t be around to care!” March-Hare pulled out a robotic arm attached to a weapon and somehow triggered it to fire.

Maddock dove backwards and rolled, avoiding the first blast. Then rolled into shadows to avoid the next few, but March-Hare was able to keep track of him the entire time. It was definitely inhuman and dangerous. Maddock gave a huff and called the shadows to his face and body and stepped out to face his deranged foe.

“What, you’re standing still?” March-Hare paused, “Good. Die!” 

The blast went off and struck Maddock hard in the chest, but the shadows held firm to him. Then another blast echoed around him. Then a third before March-Hare tossed the weapon away in frustration. 

“What are you?!” He pulled out a police issued shotgun. 

“I am The Wraith, Revenant of...” He paused trying to find the words before finally settling on, “...I am here to protect the innocent and avenge those that justice has been denied.”

“Pretty words.” March-Hare fired and the shotgun ripped into Maddock’s armored form, but he never flinched. “Why won’t you die?!”

“We’re already dead.” Maddock snarled. 

March-Hare froze. “Even Alice?” 

Two darts smacked into March-Hare’s skull. 

“Ow.” March Hare said as he fell to the ground.

“Doctor says that should hold him for a few minutes.” Smiles said as he walked over. “Did he even hurt you?”

Maddock glared at Smiles but handed him the pistol.

“As always, it has been a pleasure.” Smiles laughed as he lit his lighter and disappeared into the flames in a spiraling flash.

Maddock looked over his quarry, he was covered in stolen gear and tools. Maddock quickly relieved him of all his gear, but stopped when he touched a length of wrapped bandages.

“Ha!” March-Hare mumbled. “Got those from the mummy-lord’s lackey!” 

Maddock called shadows forward and had them lift the bandage up. He looked it over and felt the dark magics pouring from it. He glared at it and understood that this was what hurt his brothers.

“How does it work?” Maddock asked.

“No clue.” March-Hare laughed. “Just makes people feel paiiin.” He chuckled and Maddock watched his hands twitch.

“That include you?” Maddock asked as the shadows tied the bandages in a knot around his hands.

“What?” March-Hare asked as he felt pain coursing through his hands. March-Hare began to scream and continued to do so as Maddock walked away. “GET BACK HERE YOU GREEN BASTARD! YOU PETER PAN WANNABE! I’ll RIP YOU APART! YOU AND YOUR STUPID LOST FUCKS!” 

Maddock walked away calmly, the madness that March-Hare was suffering was deep and satisfying for the Revenant to feel radiate off the sickening creature. He was satisfied that the monster would be taken in soon. In the meantime he had to make a trip to the docks.

**---B)(S)(F---**

Maddock walked the roofs of the buildings on the south-eastern docks. Pharaoh had claimed and held this territory for a long time. Even in his slumber he felt the city recoil and shriek in fear from the entity. He would have to take the time later to push back at the monster, but for now he had a purpose beyond himself and his curse. 

He walked quietly and quickly spotted two agents of the undead lord’s employ. The news had called the one wrapped in bandages Khalis. He was a madman in his own right, a sycophant of a servant with modern weapons training. The other was one that Elbee had warned him about, Sight Beyond Sight, an oracle that fervently followed the undead lord and believed in him and his goals. Maddock grinned, he had always been a bane of oracles and clairvoyants, as no one could ever fully know what lay in a shadow.

He leaped off the roof and popped up from the shadow of a light pole that had been between the two as they were talking about making an attack on some crime families. As he rose from the shadows, the shadows themselves formed hands and pushed them both away, but several grabbed onto Khalis and held him as Maddock approached.

“What...” Khalis struggled, “We ain’t killed no-one!” 

Maddock’s blood boiled and he pulled off the glove on his right hand and put it on Khalis’ bandaged and undead face. He never said a word as he poured the pain of hundreds slain by the undead monster, right back into the beast’s mind. Khalis thrashed and roared and went silent.

“You dare!” Sight Beyond Sight lashed out with a green tendril of viscous energy, but Maddock stepped into a shadow and phased through it. 

It swung back again, and he repeated the action. It was one he had practiced many times over a millenia. One that he knew all too well and on the third swing he rushed past the tendril and drove the blade of his white hilted dagger into the other monster’s chest. The creature shrieked and in a flash it vanished leaving red blood on it. Maddock stared at the blood, it told him all he needed to know, something dangerous was riding in a human. He felt something try to compel him forward, but he turned back to Khalis, he had a mission and time was running low.

As he stalked back to Khalis a cloud of black smoke billowed up around the mummy and another undead being pulled the catatonic undead from Maddock’s shadow’s grasp. The catatonic mummy vanished as Pharaoh turned and faced Maddock.

“The Wraith, leader of the Family of Wrath. What have I done to invite your ire?” Pharaoh stepped towards the Revenant.

“I could list a holocaust of those dead because of you, but today I’m here on a personal errand. Your minion’s weapons were used to hurt my family.” Maddock kept a grip on his dagger and did not sheath it, but kept it pressed against his forearm and ready to use.

“And you assault us as a result.” Pharaoh snapped and launched a spell at the undead avenger.

Maddock let the shadows pull him in and he appeared behind the Mummy and dropped a kick into his back faster than the other undead could react. Pharaoh stumbled forward and turned to glare at the revenant, then produced a staff and cast a beam forward at the revenant. The beam struck true, and brought Maddock to his knees.

“Good, you know how to bow.” Pharaoh sneered.

“I bow to one Lord!” Maddock forced himself to his knees and let the shadows take him for the moment, The Wraith had been called to fight.

Pharaoh stumbled back again and stared at the Revenant.  “True faith from one as cursed as you? So I will use my true faith.” He sneered as he pressed a button on a device on his wrist and black armor cascaded out puffs of black smoke and built up around the undead lord.

The Wraith glared back at the undead creature encased in armor and Maddock grimaced beneath his own mask. This night was getting interesting, but it was taking too much time. He bolted forward and switched his dagger to The Wages of Sin and it dug deep past the metal armor.  Missiles followed him as he continued to run along the docks, he opened a portal of shadow and let them follow him.  When he came out he was behind his enemy and he flipped over the head of Pharaoh and the missiles attempted to follow but slammed into their owner, oddly not detonating as they did so, but went inert anyway.

“As if I would let my own weapons harm me!” Pharoah raised his arm and a canon popped out and focused on The Wraith.

A flash of steel and shadow later and the canon was in four pieces. 

“How are you this powerful?!” Pharaoh snarled.

The Wraith stalked forward and shadows ensnared the armor around Pharaoh and peeled it from his body.

“I am nigh a millennia old, charged by my Lord to bring the wicked to Him.” The Wraith snarled and froze as Maddock forced himself back to the surface over the desires of the curse and the thrall. “For now give me an answer and I will move on, or I could remind you of Moses’ own warnings.” 

Pharaoh glared at the revenant. “I need my hands.” 

Maddock let the mummy’s arms free .

Pharaoh produced a wrapping and three seeds. “Mix these with water enough to make a paste and apply it to the wound.” 

Maddock took the items and released Pharaoh.

The mummy stood and glared as the revenant looked the items over. “Be careful to invoke names that no longer listen, revenant.” 

“He listens.” Maddock hissed, “I am simply unworthy.” He stepped back into shadow and rolled out into his bathroom and pulled out a mortar and pestle that Raine always kept with the family. 

He put in the ingredients and mixed them at a feverish pace until he had a thick paste. Then he rushed to Elbee’s room and saw his brother asleep, he assumed from all the pain. He moved to apply the paste but quickly saw that the wounds had been healed and the damage was gone. Then he heard Raine’s voice in the living room and he bolted out to see what had happened.

He ran out to see his sister sitting on the couch with Karma, enjoying some tea. He stared in slight shock and froze.

“Maddock!” Raine smiled and her face slightly faltered. “Karma helped out.” 

“I have healing powers.” Karma held up her hands and they gave a golden glow but there were marks on her arm. “I’m not really registered though and I don’t want to be.” 

“You took his pain?” Maddock asked.

“Part of it, not all.” Karma smiled and cleared her throat. “Nice cloak.” 

Maddock paused as his brain caught up to the fact that he hadn’t slipped back into civilian clothing between all the different points of his arrival.

“FECK!” Maddock shouted.

“You want to share the story or should we wait for Elbee?” Raine smiled.

“FECK!” Maddock shouted again as he stormed off to his room. 

“He’s not good with surprises is he?” Karma asked as she sipped her drink.

“Eh, give him a minute. He got caught up and slipped up. Last time that happened we got Smiles.” Raine sneered.

Elbee walked out of his room and yawned. “Told you.” 

“Ya feckin’ did.” Raine smirked and hugged her younger sibling. 

A few moments later Maddock returned in his hoodie still holding the mortar and pestle. “I’m sorry, Karma. I’ve had a stressful night.” 

“So I gathered.” Karma nodded. “What’s that?” 

“It was to help Elbee. Now you a bit, I suppose.” Maddock offered.

“It's not the same wound. It’s my body mimicking it.” Karma smiled, “Thank you though.” 

“You probably got questions.” Maddock sighed.

“You better, I believe the word is, ‘feckin’ believe it.” Karma smiled.

“She is now a new sister.” Raine smiled, “I love her dearly.” 

I can’t feckin’ win tonight.” Maddock smiled, “It’s a long story, you should get comfortable.” He sat on the couch next to her as Elbee curled up on a recliner with a cup of cocoa. 

“I’m good here.” Karma inched closer to Maddock. 

“We were born about a millenia ago. 1099, to be exact. At least Rain and I were.” Maddock started. “I was first.” 

“He ne’er shuts up about that part.” Raine smirked.

“You wanna tell it, huh?” Maddock snapped.

“Be a bit less gloomy that way.” Raine rolled her eyes. 

Maddock snorted and then the two exploded into a fit of Irish insults and jabs. Karma just watched and smiled, then winked to Elbee.

“It’ll be a minute, you want some pointers on Irish slang?” Elbee sighed.

“Love to.” Karma giggled.

***Monday, April 23, 2079***

**Easter Afternoon**

“What about this one?” Cassandra asked as she mimicked the dress on screen, trying to help Agatha search for a dress for her upcoming prom in less than a month.

“Too frilly.” Agatha sighed.

Cassandra sighed. 

“It’s like no one really gets the vibe I want!” Agatha groaned.

“I get that because I clearly don’t.” Cassandra smirked, “I’m wondering if you do.”

Agatha tossed a pillow at her sister.

“Come on, I’m sure Cxaltho has to have found the eggs by now.” Agatha sighed, “Good idea for a distraction by the way.” 

“I mean, I had fun when I got to do it as a kid.” Cassandra smiled, “I figured he should have some fun too. And mama was so excited about it.” 

As the two headed down they saw Danny on his phone looking at tuxedos for Prom as well. He was busy changing colors and swapping designs on the screen and phased right through his sisters and the floor.

“He’s getting so annoying with that now.” Agatha huffed.

“You’re just mad you can’t slug him in the shoulder anymore.” Cassandra blew a raspberry. 

“Maybe, but...” Agatha paused, “Shut up.” 

Cassandra laughed as she felt Cxaltho re-attach to her from behind.

“I got all the eggs. Some were chocolate!” He giggled like a mad villain whose plan had succeeded. 

Alan was sitting on the couch, holding a basket full of eggs. Endara was next to him laughing happily. 

“I spent hours hiding some of these.” Alan sighed. “How...” 

Cxaltho peeked out from behind Cassandra’s hair. “I have senses you don’t. Also, chocolate.” 

Alan shook his head and sighed, “Well, I’m glad you had fun.” He looked at his eldest children as Danny phased past the couch and sat on a chair. “How’s the search going for you two?” 

“Drag me through a dessert.” Agatha gave a disgusted fake smile.

“Why do none of these colors work?!” Danny snapped.

“Because you’re trying to pick based on your skin.” Cassandra smiled, “You need contrast based on your skin tone then pick the color that goes best.” 

“Yeah, listen to the fashionista.” Agatha smirked.

“And Agatha needs to realize no designer can read her mind.” Cassandra sighed, “But if she tells me what she wants we can work together.” 

Agatha crossed her arms, “When did you get so smart about how to deal with us.” 

“I have Anna as the best ally ever.” Cassandra smiled, “Where is she anyway?” 

“Greg wanted to talk with her, they’re in the city.” Alan sighed, “Hoping that boy doesn’t crush his own friendship with her.” 

“They’ll be fine. He’s just worried about her overdoing things since Tyyrn.” Danny said as he looked at Agatha. “So, one more year?” 

“Ugh...” Agatha rolled her eyes. “Don’t remind me. Stupid laws messed up our credits just enough we need one more year of standard classes.” 

“Well at least you all get a free prom from it.” Endara smiled, “This is free, right?” 

“All T.E.A. events are technically free.” Danny explained, “but we usually put it all together as part of the student government. This is the faculty putting it all together for us. Even the lower grades get some fun in it.” 

“Anna’s going to be DJ’ing.” Agatha said, “Probably with Angie too.” 

“Well, once all these new, stupid orders from the Senate are cleared up we’ll finally have some free time and I promise some family fun.” Alan smiled, “Now. I’m going to get some lunch started. Who wants what?” 

Orders were shouted from everyone, including from an office further down the way. Alan smiled, but felt a pull off towards the city. There was a mind reeling screaming against an intense light and darkness and he couldn’t help but feel that whatever it was was going to be coming to a head soon.

I got mad and tossed my ring on the ground and now it’s dented. He got upset that I did that and took it back. Later I went to his house to talk to him and he was sitting with his parents. He just ignored me and wouldn’t respond. His parents left the room so we could talk in private and I had to beg for him to say something. He eventually gave the ring back. Today things still aren’t back to normal. He won’t talk or text much. We went and got coffee but it wasn’t fun like usual. He works overnights and tonight he hardly hugged me bye. I feel like an awful person. I know he doesn’t understand why I do the things I do and I don’t either. I was going to eat with my parents tonight -

I had the day off from my part-time job at the café, so I decided to treat myself to a rare, leisurely cup of coffee instead of rushing around like usual. Ironically, this turned out to be a huge mistake.

 The café was buzzing. I was juggling my phone between my ear and shoulder, trying to balance two steaming coffees .

“Yeah, Mom,” I said, nudging the door open with my hip. “Rent’s fine, I promise. I’m not going to end up homeless.” I glanced around the café. My favorite window spot – prime people-watching territory – was taken by some guys. Sighing, I shoved my phone in my pocket and spotted an empty table in the corner. Perfect.

Then, disaster struck. I don’t even know how it happened, but one of the coffees just launched itself. It landed, with impressive accuracy, all over this guy in what had to be the most expensive suit I’d ever seen outside of a movie.

“Oh my god! I’m so, so sorry!” I gasped, leaving the other coffee on the counter and grabbing a bunch of napkins. The guy turned around, and, wow. Piercing blue eyes, a jawline that could cut glass. But his face? Ice cold.

 “Clearly,” he said, looking at his coffee-soaked suit.

“I’ll fix it! Well, not fix it exactly, but—” I thrust a handful of napkins at him, my shaky hands knocking over the sugar dispenser, adding a cascade of sugar to the mess.

“Please,” he said, taking the napkins from me, a look of pure annoyance on his face. “This is… unfortunate.”

“More like a disaster! I just ruined your…” I gestured at his suit, quickly estimating it probably cost more than three months of my rent.

 “I’ll pay for the dry cleaning.”

He raised one  eyebrow. ""Do you regularly budget for coffee-related casualties?""

“Well, no, but I can Venmo you!” I blurted out, totally flustered.

“That won’t be necessary.” he said flatly, brushing off the droplets of coffee on his sleeve.

 I apologized again. He glanced at his watch – super fancy – and cut me off. “It’s fine,” but his tone definitely wasn’t fine. He picked up his coffee – black, of course – and headed for the door.

Then, he stopped, gave me this weird look, and then left.

The barista called out, “Hey, coffee assassin! You forgot your backup weapon!”

I turned to grab my remaining coffee and froze. Next to it was a business card. It read: Caleb Reed, Architect. And underneath, a handwritten note: *Next time, aim better.*",1,1736479627.0,stories,2,1.0,False

I was walking my dog tonight and we came across a skunk who was eating from a garbage bag. The skunk tore through the garbage and left a mess on the whole sidewalk, my dog first grabbed a coffee cup then dropped it once he saw the skunk and it ended up running away. Right at that moment another person walked by so I moved out the way and was distracted for a second when my dog grabbed some food scrap from the ground that came from the garbage. I immediately opened my dogs mouth to get it out like I usually do when he grabs stuff off the ground but he was very protective over this one and started biting me, not aggressively to draw blood more just to leave him alone but he ended up swallowing whatever he had.

We got home and before I could put him in his crate he grabbed another crumb of food on the floor near our garbage and when I tried to take it away he put up another fight. Although he did not bite me hard enough to draw blood I did get a lot of his saliva on both my hands and I immediately hand sanitized and washed.

The thing is that earlier today I pulled a cuticle from my thumb leaving a small cut. No blood came out when I pulled it but it is light red and fresh and burned when I put hand sanitizer.

My dog is a puppy about 5 and a half months old and got his rabies vaccine back in the end of November so I believe he should be good as he did not make any physical contact with the skunk. 

I’m just unsure if this skunk was rabid and if it was able to transfer the virus to the food scraps laying on the ground that my dog ended up eating. Furthermore could it have possibly transferred to me via his saliva to the cuticle cut? Once I noticed my dog has something in his mouth I tried to take it right away so the food was in his mouth along with my hands and his saliva. 

I read the FAQs. I saw the skunks face for a brief moment before it ran away and I couldn’t see any saliva drooling but he was startled after seeing my dog and backed away.

TLDR - skunk with unknown rabies status left fresh food scrap on the ground that my vaccinated dog had in his mouth and my vaccinated dogs saliva with the food scrap in his mouth made contact with a small cuticle cut on my hand, is my dog or myself in danger?",1,1736479554.0,rabies,1,1.0,False

Paulina Miczka
Coffee: 35g
Grind: 8/10
Water: 370g @ 84°C
Brewer: Inverted
Filter: Paper
Put 35g of coffee into your AeroPress
From 0:00 to 0:15, add 150g of water
From 0:15 to 0:35, stir and keep stirring
At 0:35, put filter cap (with pre-wet filter) in place
At 1:05, flip the AeroPress and start pressing
At 1:35, stop pressing. You should have now 90ml of the concentrated brew (4.5%TDS)
Add 160g - 200g of hot water and enjoy!


Buuuuut I was doing the math, and at 1%-1.5% caffeine concentration with Arabica beans, 35g is anywhere from 350-525mg, and here I am on my third cup. It doesn't make sense that 3 cups of this coffee could be equivalent to close to 8 NoDoz pills. 

I was looking for inefficiencies in the extraction process but there really aren't any. 

For reference, 35g is right up to the bottom of the 1 circle on the travel size AeroPress.

Could my caffeine consumption really be in the 1g-1.5g range? Because if so that's fucked.

My 14 year old bird has turned into a monster.,"In the last week or so, my bird has been very aggressive toward my dog. My dog is scared of him, so he has never tried to bite my bird. (My bird was in love with the dog I had before, so never a problem.) It seems to have started around New Year's, and my dog is scared to death of fireworks, which my wonderful neighbors set off for 5 days, so my dog was very clingy. I'm wondering if that triggered jealousy on my bird's part, but I don't know what to do about it. I try to give my bird extra scritches, but he doesn't want them. It also doesn't make sense because we've had my dog for almost 7 years, and we go through the fireworks nightmare twice a year.

Today, my daughter-in-law surprised me by bringing her dog with her to visit. In the past, she's always asked first, and I've always said yes because I love her dog, but it was a last minute decision. (Her dog was seriously pouting about having to stay home.) My bird is now being aggressive toward her, too, and he never had a problem with her before. They even used to play together. The thing is, she is not afraid of him, so I'm worried about what may happen. He's used to being out whenever I'm home, which is most of the time, so he screams when I put him in his cage for long, and then my husband gets pissed off. (I don't enjoy either.) And often, if he thinks he's gonna get put in his cage, he'll run and fly all over the place and I can't catch him.

I have decided that for the next three days, I will put his cage in the guest room during the day. Hopefully, getting put in his cage when he misbehaves will get the point across. Before this, he would sit on my shoulder or play on the coffee table while my dog sits on the couch next to me. Most of the time it's not a problem, but now this. 

I've seen a few other posts where someone's bird suddenly gets aggressive. Does anyone have any advice? I don't understand the sudden change, and if he keeps this up, I will have to re-home him. He doesn't like anybody but me which means he would end up in a bird sanctuary and be miserable. ",1,1736479337.0,Conures,2,1.0,False

1hxv5j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hxv5j1/i_19m_dont_feel_loved_by_my_girlfriend19f_despite/,I (19M) don’t feel loved by my girlfriend(19F) despite knowing she loves me.,"Hi all, 
Sorry for the long post but wanted to give most of the context. I’ve been struggling a bit recently on what to do because little things keep getting to me and I can’t tell if I’m being irrational anymore or not. So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a year and a few months now. Obviously I know we’re young and still in uni but I personally hate the idea that you haven’t met someone for you yet instead of working through issues but I just don’t know how much longer I can go on.
So for context: we met in first year as friends and moved in together with some of our other friends and only after choosing to move in together we had started dating. I do believe we wouldn’t hate each other or find it too awkward living together if we did break up so the fact we live together isint what keeping us together.

As the title suggests I know she loves me but most of the time I don’t feel that love. It started a few months into our relationship where I’d ask to just get a ‘love you ❤️’ every now and again or asking her to send more snaps of herself and for one or two weeks she would but it 

would never last. 
I think part of my problem boils down to something we’ve talked about together recently where she simply dosent have a love language, in the past she’d say it’s quality time together but when we’re together watching a show she’ll never turn down a call from her friends and it could last for a while, while I’m just sitting there waiting for her to finish, all the while if I call her while she is with her friends she will never pick up. 

This also ties into the fact I often feel she prioritises her friends to me. The most recent example is she had very seriously promised me that we would spend Halloween together doing matching costumes but the closer it got to Halloween the more she put it off getting a costume. And then when it was a few days away she got invited to a party (that she thought was way bigger than it was) that didn’t allow plus ones and chose to go to that as well only to leave after a couple of hours cause it was shit. 

Then later she said her love language was gifting things but she’ll only get me gifts on the big occasions like anniversaries or Christmas, and while I get we’re in uni and broke. She never cuts back on the 4th £4 coffee of the week or cuts down on Vinted shopping to buy me a little thing. 
On top of this every now and again she’ll make me feel bad (not intentionally) for liking the things I like, a few examples for reference are, I recently wanted to get (while I can admit) cringe Spider-Man hoodie for the gym but instead of simply saying she dosent like it she’ll judge it heavily and make me feel bad for liking it. 
Or on new years (originally a joke) I wanted to go to the Lego store on New Year’s Day a few hours before opening to get the new sets and while I’m not expecting her to support or like the idea, instead of just saying no again she made me feel bad for even wanting to go. and it makes me question the relationship more when my friends (who I spent new years with and have absolutely no interest in Lego) almost all agreed to go just because they knew I liked it and thought it’d be fun to wait in a queue with each other (which it was)

She’ll also never ‘dress up’ for me, while I get that what I find attractive and her style is very different I figured with how much clothes she but in over a year she could have bought something I like once. Or the fact she’ll go clubbing 1-2 time a week and half the time she dresses sexy for that and I’ll comment you should dress like that for me more often but she never does. 

Obviously this has all been from my perspective and I’m probably bias. But my girlfriend and I talk about these issues but she’ll either apologise and not change or will say ‘you’re so sensitive’ or ‘I was just joking you shouldn’t have taken it seriously’ . While I get I am probably more sensitive then the regular guy (we have a running joke of me being the woman and her being the man) that dosent just mean I don’t feel the way I feel or that I’ll stop feeling this way. 

I understand if I’m sounding needy but when she has no real way of expressing her love it just makes me feel unloved and that she dosent love me enough to make an effort.

I’m just lost right now and don’t know what to do, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Should we break up or try work through it?",1,1736479231.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1hxv31q,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1hxv31q/budget_coffee_machine_suggestions_for_a_small/,Budget Coffee Machine Suggestions for a Small Cafe/Byte Shop,"I’m planning to set up a small cafe in a rent-free space, alongside an existing bite-sized food shop (think snacks and quick meals). The coffee menu will primarily include lattes, cappuccinos, South Indian filter coffee, and instant coffee options (the latter being the main revenue driver).


Since this is a small-scale operation, I’m looking for a budget-friendly coffee machine that:

1. Can handle decent daily volume (about 20–50 milk-based drinks per day).


2. Offers reliability and consistency for espresso-based drinks.


3. Works well in a compact setup (space is limited).


4. Is easy to maintain and clean.



I’d like to keep the budget reasonable (preferably under ₹60,000, but I can stretch a bit if necessary).

If anyone has recommendations or insights from their experience, I’d love to hear them. Bonus points for tips on how to scale coffee service efficiently in a small food shop setting!

Thanks in advance!

But to be honest the cappuccino set is my least favourite out of this series, not only because of the mess I found once I opened my ball but also because the cocoa powder stencils barely worked.

1hxuxsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1hxuxsk/trip_report_taiwan_november_2024/,"Trip report! Taiwan, November 2024","I biked around Taiwan in November and had a great time! Thought I'd share a trip report in case it's useful for others who might be planning their own trip. I was in Taiwan for 23 days total, with a couple of days in Taipei at the beginning (to get over jetlag, coming in from NYC) and end (to shop for souvenirs)

I rented my bike from MathewBike- (super friendly and I was really happy with the bike, a Rikulau road bike- didn't even get a flat the whole trip). The trip mostly followed the route 1 itinerary, but I went off actual route 1 whenever possible, since it's a lot of riding along the highway, especially on the West Coast. Google Maps kinda sucked and sent me on some weird detours several times. Some of this might have been because of typhoon-related road closures (I got there the morning after typhoon Kong Rey hit), but some other times it sent me to a nonexistent bridge to cross a river etc. Added some miles to some long days, but nothing too terrible. The worst case was between Sun Moon Lake and Chiayi, and there were some other times, like between Taichung and Puli where there's some construction along the river and the bike trail ends abruptly with no warning. Another annoyance were stray dogs, which chased me a few times and gave me a bit of a scare- happened more on the East Coast.

People were super friendly, I was surprised by how little English people spoke, but a little basic Mandarin courtesy of Duolingo, + Google translate helped a lot (the image translation is a lifesaver for street food etc). One thing that also surprised me was how few people I met along the way- I hardly saw any other cyclists, except for the Giant tour groups every couple of days, so it did get a bit lonely. Hotels and food very cheap and great value- I spent about $40/ night on average for hotels with no need to book much in advance in most cases. Exceptions were in Xiaoliuqiu, but I was there during a weekend. Food was mostly delicious with lots of options, I ate at night markets a lot but even the sit down places were not expensive (nice meals for $10-15). 711 and Family Mart are everywhere and came in handy for cold drinks/ coffee/ quick lunches and fruit etc. But also lots of roadside fruit stalls (cherimoya in the south!!). Definitely carry cash- for the night markets and street food/ fruit stalls, but also some hotels I stayed at only took cash.

On the East Coast, the Shouka pass was honestly not that hard at all, but the trek after the descent towards the West Coast, along the highway to Taitung is a slog against the wind (and for me in the rain) and with constant heavy traffic, though the beautiful coastline makes up for it a bit. Taitung-Yuli-Hualien were some of my favourite riding, along with the Suhua highway (though I took the train from Hualien to Chongde, biked to Nan'ao, and took the train from there to Su'ao)- basically a bike trail at this point, I maybe saw 5 cars total. Jiaoxi-Taipei was fun too.

Overall I loved this trip (my first time bike touring!), and I would consider going back to Taiwan for sure to see Kenting National Park, and Kaohsiung, which I ended up skipping in favor of Xiaoliuqiu.

**Full biking itinerary:**

1. Taipei - Hsinchu 
2. Hsinchu - Taichung
3. Taichung - Puli 
4. Puli - Ita Thao (Sun Moon Lake)
5. Ita Thao (Sun Moon Lake) - Chiayi
6. Chiayi - Tainan (by train), bike around Tainan
7. Tainan - Xiaoliuqiu (train to Chaozhou, bike to ferry)
8. Biking around Xiaoliuqiu 
9. Xiaoliuqiu - Sichongxi
10. Sichongxi - Taitung
11. Day off in Taitung
12. Taitung - Yuli
13. Day off (typhoon) in Yuli
14. Yuli - Hualien
15. Hualien - Su'ao (train from Hualien to Chongde, bike from Chongde to Nan'ao, train to Suaoxin, bike to Su'ao)
16. Su'ao - Jiaoxi
17. Day off in Jiaoxi
18. Jiaoxi - TaipeiTotal riding around 650 miles

*I stood alone on the waterlogged gravel, the icy wind clawing at my face, and dark trees lined the road on either side. Thunder rolled in the black clouds, surreal flashes of white, yellow, and green lightning peeled through the air, and a cascade of raindrops chilled me to the bone. Strange calls rumbled through the night, and shudders rippled through the pebbles under my feet with every thunderclap, almost like the distant footfalls of some colossal giant.*

*“Come with us.” Something darted through the bushes to my left, just out of my sight within the newest flash of lightning.*

*Whirling, I choked back a cry of alarm at the hoarse whisper and peered into the gloom. “H-Hello?”*

*A twig snapped to my right, and I barely caught the outline of an arm disappear behind a tree trunk. “It’s so warm in the rain.”*

*Spinning in a slow, cautious circle, I groped for my Type 9, only to find my weapons were gone. One thing hung by my side, and I fumbled with the clumsy squarish object until my finger hit a button, and it whirred to life.*

*My camera?*

*Confused, I raised the device so the viewing screen faced my eye and swept the darkness with it. Somehow, I could see through the inky shadows better through its lens, and a shiver of alarm went through me as the viewfinder landed on a reflective pair of milk-white eyes watching from the trees.*

*“Soon you’ll see.” The bark-gray face grinned at me from the edge of the forest, and the Puppet lunged down onto all fours, speeding away up the gravel road with childish glee. “Hurry up! It’s almost time.”*

*Icy droplets trickled down the back of my neck to make my teeth chatter, but I ignored the urge to run and trudged up the long road behind the Puppet, which stayed just on the edge of my camera’s vision range. More and more eyes floated out of the trees with each step I took, their bare feet squishing on mud, fingers clawing at gravel, always just beyond my sight. Eerie giggles and snickers flitted through the night, faces popping out from behind logs, rocks, and sumps to grin at me with anticipation, only to duck back the second I turned to get a better look.*

*The longer I walked, a subtle chorus of whispers rose from them all; a single word repeated over and over, soft at first, but louder the further we went.*

*“Lost . . . lost . . . lost . . .”*

*At last, my gray-skinned guide led me off the roadway, and over a rising grass bank into a broad cleared area.*

*I froze at the top of the embankment, and a sense of recognition slithered through me. I’d been here before, or at least, had seen it somewhere before.*

*“Come on, come on, it’s so close.” The croaking voice urged, not quite human but not quite animal, and with a fluid-filled gurgle at the back of every word.*

*Out before me stretched a long grassy plain, in the center of which stood a jumble of dilapidated concrete buildings. They looked to have been some kind of coal processing facility at one point, though from the rust and overgrown foliage, I guessed that time had long since passed. A single gray elevator tower rose from all of them, a gaping hole in it halfway up, and the rest of the structure seemed to remain upright by sheer will. A blizzard of vines snaked up the side to create a dense thicket, and a heap of thick logs lay mounded against the side like giant discarded chopsticks.*

*My blood went colder than the rain, and I stifled a gasp to myself. “Whoa.”*

*It had been enormous, the legs of the being so long they almost stretched to the edge of the plain, the arms limp at its side, head slumped in the strange embrace of death. I could have stood in the center of its open four-fingered palms and not been able to reach both sides of the hand with my arms outstretched. Laid out on its back, the corpse would have been too long to fit within the crowded walls of the Ark River settlement. The Oak Walker’s skin had grown patches of black-green mold, its torso burst open where ribs would have been if it had been human. The vines around it seemed to be dying as fast as they were growing, a layer of greenery on the outside with dead standing underneath, brittle and rotten. Something about the atmosphere felt both terrifying and sad, melancholy and horrific, as if I stood on the verge of some great crime scene that no one else knew about.*

*Movement caught my eye, and I blinked in fascination as hordes of scurrying figures crept from the wilderness all around, closing in on the tower with silent reverence. They were Puppets, that I could see clearly enough in the near-constant peals of lightning, and as they drew near, each picked a spot on the marshy ground to sit, knees drawn to their chest like a child in school as they waited. They beamed at the motionless Oak Walker with nothing less than worshipful admiration, and the ones around me no longer bothered to hide as they slunk past on their way to join in.*

*A cold, clammy set of fingers worked into my free hand, and I almost screamed.*

*“Everyone’s here.” She grinned at me through brown, peg shaped teeth, a girl Puppet who could have been my age had she been human, standing fully upright, her moldy black hair drenched with rain. “We can be warm again, soon. It’s been so long.”*

*Scared out of my mind, I watched her go with the others, unable to make myself flee. Something deep inside my chest tugged, like a hook on the end of an invisible fishing line, drawing me toward the tower. My feet moved one step in front of the other, and while my mind pleaded with me to scream, to break free, to run, I couldn’t.*

*On the way, my foot kicked something hard in the mud, and I looked down to see a rusted pistol in the weeds.*

*‘Maddie, run!’ A man’s voice echoed in my mind, faint, but filled with desperate fear.*

*Leaving it in the muck, I went on, down the rows of silent Puppets, into the maze of vines, and soon found myself walking on a bridge of twisted growth that inclined upwards to the Oak Walker’s chest. The woven vines beneath my wet boots wriggled and slipped over one another in a slow, but sentient tide. Black goo oozed between them like congealed blood, and yet I never slipped, not once, as if the walkway didn’t want me to fall.*

*At the height of the ramp, a tall dark figure stood with his back to me, face shrouded by the mold-encrusted hood of his poncho. In one hand he held the book, open to the page with the knife drawing on it, the runes on the strange parchment glowing red like embers of a dying campfire. In the other, Vecitorak gripped the long, wooden dagger, its jagged blade soaked with rivers of blood that dripped onto the ground in a crimson trickle. He muttered something under his gravelly breath, words in a foreign language I’d never heard before, and the wind seemed to howl fiercer with every syllable as if it too sensed something was coming.*

*My feet stopped not far to his right, and I looked down into the chest cavity of the Oak Walker.*

*Oh no, no, no . . .*

*Panic surged in my veins, and my lungs refused to draw air for a scream, the sight too horrendous to look away from.*

*They lay heaped on top of one another, broken, mangled, and still. Chris, Jamie, Adam, Eve, Sean, and dozens of other faces I recognized lay frozen in agonized screeches of pain, their chests ripped open by deep stab wounds. Greasy slate-colored vines coiled around them, burrowed into the backs of their skulls, and pulsated like umbilical cords to pump some unseen slush into their brains. More black tendrils snaked under their torn skin, sprouted from their mouths, ears, noses, and every open wound. Red splashes of blood coated the entire platform, soaked into the bark of the Oak Walker’s flesh, and stuck to the bottom of my shoes like glue.*

*As I stared in horror, one of Chris’s eyes, now milky white, swiveled to look at me, and his root filled lips moved ever so slightly.*

*“Kill . . . me . . .”*

*Guts roiling in grievous terror, I managed to force myself to take a step backward, but this only brough my attention to the thing that hovered over the pile of sacrifices, suspended by its own web of vines.*

*A body, contorted in the spasm of its torment hung above the rest, almost completely enclosed with growth. Her hair was filled with mold, the auburn tresses clogged with matted blood, and roots slithered like worms from puncture wounds all over her body, an untold number of stabs by the hideous wooden blade. Sprouts grew from every orifice in her skull, and only the girl’s face was still uncovered, pale as a sheet. More growth wove around her face to rise in spikes above her head, resembling a twig-like crown, and her cloudy eyes were fixed on the platform in pleading desperation.*

*Kneeling in the aura of her gaze, bound and motionless in submission to Vecitorak’s blade . . . was me.*

*I stared at myself, this nightmarish version of me wrapped in vines so she couldn’t escape, bruised, bloodied, and defeated. Roots inched up the other Hannah’s neck, pried into her ears, and gouged between her lips with invasive greed. Tendrils spiderwebbed over her eyeballs to plunge into her head, and bored up her nose with the gut-wrenching sounds of crunching bone, squelching flesh, and popping sinew.*

*The other Hannah put her head back to wail in torment, and all the other bodies did the same, a cacophony of misery that made panic rise in my chest.*

*“I told you.” Vecitorak turned, seemed to see the real me standing there, and spread his arms wide like some doomsday prophet, his ragged voice brimming with triumph. “You belong to the Master. Embrace the call, and I will take away your pain.”*

*He reached for me with one half-rotted hand, and my panic reached critical levels as my legs refused to work.*

*I couldn’t move, couldn’t fight, and as Vecitorak closed in, I cried out with complete hopelessness deep inside my head.*

*Someone please, help me.*

*“Enough!” A baritone voice shook the ground under my feet, broke through the sound of thunder, wind, and whispering Puppets, enough to make the entire world go silent.*

*Golden light flooded around me, warm and bright. It drove the Puppets away with wild screeches of terror, and the growth burned to ash in its wake. Vecitorak threw up his arms to bellow in rage even as a blast of light drove him into the shadows and knocked me to my knees.*

*I covered my eyes in fear, but the rays of light hummed between my fingers, and washed over every part of me.*

*Across the air came a whisper, but not the skin-crawling tones of the void or its minions. No, this was a single voice, kind and soft, and two arms wound around my shoulders, to pull me close.*

*“Oh, filia mea.” The stranger whispered to me as he stroked my hair, and I blinked through tears in my eyes to see his luminous silver irises peering back. “After all this time, can you still not see? Look closer Hannah. Open your eyes.”*

“Open your eyes, Hannah, please.”

I jolted awake, and sucked in a sharp breath, heart pounding a million miles a minute. Faint yellow light blinded me for a moment, and I writhed out of panicked instinct, unsure of where I was.

“Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.” Gentle arms held me still, guided me back down to the soft mattress, and a soft set of lips pressed to my forehead. “You’re alright, you’re okay. I’m right here.”

Blinking, I discovered a room all around me, a furnished room with a beige carpeted floor that matched the sandstone-colored walls. A plush bed rested underneath me, and the golden radiance of an electric lamp glowed from a nightstand nearby. On the opposite wall, the room’s sole window had the curtains drawn, but I could just make out the early red splashes of dawn beyond the eggshell-colored drapes. Soft white covers lay over my chest, and the smell of lye soap filled my nose. My mouth was dry, and my body sore all over, as if it had been beaten by a baseball bat. Still, I picked up the faint aroma of chocolate cologne from the t-shirt my forehead was pressed to, and my heart leapt.

“Chris?” I gasped at seeing his face hover before mine, alive and unharmed, the images of his broken body still haunting my brain.

Stunned at my tears, he scooped me back into his arms and crawled into bed next to me, rubbing my back between the shoulder blades. “Shhh, just relax, alright? Breathe for me. You’re safe, I promise.”

*A dream. It was a dream. Thank God.*

The realization shattered me, and I wept harder than I expected, unable to purge the raw fear, pain, and grief any other way. It had been so vivid, and I still felt cold, as if the rain continued to fall on my skin form the depths of the nightmare. Chris’s warmth slowly pushed that sensation away, and he whispered sweet assurance to me over and over, stroking my hair in a way that made pleasant tingles shiver down my spine. Still, I hadn’t been this frightened, truly scared of my own mind, in a long time.

“Y-You were hurt and . . . I thought they were . . . he was going to . . .” I couldn’t manage to get a full sentence out and buried my face in his soft cotton t-shirt, terrified that somehow, the shadowy dream would come back to snatch me away.

“I’m fine.” Chris bunched the covers around us in a protective little cocoon, the sheets smelling of fabric softener, the room so much cozier than what I’d grown used to living in a tent. “I’ve got Rhodesian blood, remember? We don’t die so easy.”

Allowing my heartrate to slow down, I huddled against him, feeling drained. I hadn’t had a dream like that since my infection, and I couldn’t bear the thought of dealing with that every time I closed my eyes. I didn’t get enough sleep as it was.

*Surely it was just a one-off thing . . . right?*

He leaned into the pillows and Chris brushed some hair from my face with a warm smile. “We’ve got to stop meeting like this, Brun. How are you feeling? Any pain anywhere?”

I opened my mouth to answer, but in my head, the screams of my dying men rippled forth, along with the colossal roar of the factory crumbling around us. Everything came back in a rush of anxiety, and I sat bolt upright once more.

Panicked, I whirled to look around, my equipment and uniform gone, only a loose T-shirt and some shorts on my skinny frame. “The panel. I-It was with me, I had it on my hip. Chris the panel, where is it?”

Holding up a hand to calm me, Chris reached down beside the bed to lift a canvas sling bag into the air. “Right here.”

At the sight of the dirt-stained satchel, I let out a long groan of relief and nodded toward the door. “Fourth Platoon?”

“Bunked down on the second floor.” Chris slid the panel back into its place under the bed, though his expression bore a morose veneer. “The rest of your column got hit pretty hard. Those that are still in fighting shape I pulled off the line to refit, while the rest . . . they’re with Sandra’s people in the hospital.”

*At least some of them survived.*

“Now, stop dodging my questions.” Chris teased in a gentle tone and planted another kiss on my forehead. “Are you hurting anywhere? Anything you need me to call the nurse for?”

As the tension began to subside, I flexed my limbs, wincing a little at the stiffness. “No. I’m okay. Is there any water?”

Instead of a canteen, Chris produced a real glass of water from the bedside nightstand, and I found it ice cold to the touch.

*Ice cubes? An electric lamp? Did I fall out of a nightmare and into a good dream instead?*

He chuckled at my shock and seemed satisfied at last that I was okay. “You gave us a hell of a scare, *pragtige*. Calling in an artillery strike right on top of yourself. What kind of idiot taught you to do that?”

I caught the rhetorical sarcasm in that last part and gulped down the water with a contented sigh. Each passing second made the dream fade further from my brain, and I felt more like my old self, happy and snug within the plush bedstead. Chris and I hadn’t had a private moment for a while, and I was reminded how amazing he made me feel, just by being close to him.

“Some guy I met out in the woods. He’s a bit of a nerd, but I think it’s cute.” I made a coy shrug and handed the empty glass back to him. “So, where are we?”

“Black Oak University.” Chris waved at the room with one hand. “The dormitories used to house Organ recruits, so we took it over for a barracks. Naturally that means their power grid was left intact, and there’s even real toilet paper in the bathroom.”

*Real toilet paper? Not old newspaper, or straw, or leaves? Man, I can’t decide whether I want to use it or sell it on the market.*

I frowned, and glanced at a nearby clock, which read *05:35*. “How long was I out?”

Chris’s face reverted to a somewhat cornered grimace as he ran a gentle thumb over my cheek. “When they dug you out of the rubble, my troops couldn’t wake you. Sandra ran you through an MRI machine at the hospital and said you were fine, just . . . asleep. I had you moved here to make room in the wards for the critically wounded, since the researcher girls didn’t think you were in any serious danger.”

At that, some of the happy coziness faded, and I sat up straighter. “But if you’re with me, who’s leading the offensive?”

“The offensive ended three hours ago.” Seemingly unphased by the question, he tugged me a little closer, and one of Chris’s maple-syrup-colored eyebrows arched on his forehead. “And you’ve been in bed for six.”

“*Six hours?*” I croaked, leaning into his embrace to steady myself against the news. “But what about—”

“The provisional government surrendered.” A proud grin flickered across his lips, and Chris interlaced a set of his fingers with mine. “It seems you caught the Organs right at their primary staging area. When those shells came down, it broke their main force, and they ran. Koranti evacuated his mercs, and left the local bureaucrats behind, so they gave up as soon as our trucks rolled into their neighborhoods. We’ve captured over two hundred Organ soldiers, there’s at least eight hundred dead they left behind, and the rest went with Koranti to the northern border.”

His words sank in, and as I understood what they could mean, my hopes dared to rise. “So . . .”

“We won, Hannah.” He beamed, the happiest I’d seen Chris for weeks. “We took the northern gate, the airfield, all of it. Black Oak is ours.”

*It’s . . . over? It’s over. My God, it’s really over.*

The room seemed to tilt, my world spinning, and fresh salty tears welled in my eyes. I couldn’t stop myself, the tsunami of emotion threatened to drown me, and I curled up in his arms to break all over again. Chris seemed somewhat deflated at my response, his face a mask of regret and worry as he held me, and that look only made me feel worse. It was a frustrating experience, as if someone inside me had taken over, and unleashed everything I could feel at the same time. Relief, joy, anger, sadness, pain, grief, it all blended into a single torrent that rushed out of me in a carpet of silvery moisture on my face, crushing sobs that hurt deep in my lungs, and a weakness of my limbs that made me feel almost numb.

Wiping at my face in vain, I accepted a Kleenex from him and blew my nose to try and gain a reprieve. “I-I’m sorry I don’t . . . I don’t know what’s w-wrong with me I can’t . . . I can’t stop.”

His muscled arms crushed me to his torso, and Chris reclined so that we lay side-by-side in the comfortable shadows of the room, my head on his chest. “There’ nothing wrong with you, *pragtige.* You just had a building dropped on you, and you’ve been running on a massive sleep deficit for the past three days. You’re exhausted, we both are.”

I managed to get my breathing under control enough to shake my head, humiliated and frustrated that my stupid eyeballs wouldn’t stop emitting more teardrops. “I n-never had this problem b-before.”

He looked at me for a long moment, and Chris’s expression softened with something like pity as he cradled me against himself. “Mabe it’s a delayed reaction.”

“To what?” I gripped his shirt tight in my hands, willing myself to stabilize, but my enhanced reflexes had no bearing on the storm raging inside.

Weaving gentle fingers into my hair, Chris held my gaze, his own knowing and jaded. “New Wilderness. Jamie. Andrea. Most people go their whole lives without losing what we have in just two months. All the death, all the pain, it was going to affect you sooner or later. It’s *normal*, Hannah.”

“You’re not freaking out.” The tears began to slow, and I got my breathing down to a somewhat-regular pace.

“I got it out of my system already.” Pain rippled through his demeanor, a deep hurt that made my heart stop for a few seconds. “When they dragged you out of that rubble I . . . I thought I would die. I’ve never been so scared in all my life.”

He leaned forward to kiss my cheek for the hundredth time, but at the last moment, I turned to dab at my eye with another Kleenex. Chris instead grazed the base of my neck with his lips, and it sent a bolt of liquid fire up my back, enough that I felt my mind go a little fuzzy.

*That. I want more of that. Now.*

Ravenous for the only feeling that made the chaos in my head stop, I took his face in my hands and pressed my lips to his.

He didn’t fight me, and I relished the heat that surged through my body in a tidal wave of flame. Chris’s lips trailed down my jaw to my neck, and when his mouth hit the soft skin at the base of my throat, my brain turned molten. As if in a pendulum from the mental cascade of a few minutes ago, my body craved him now, hungry with a primal need that I felt stronger than ever before.

“Hannah . . .” Chris grunted a warning in between our feverish kisses, but I refused to hear him, knowing already what he would say.

Unable to hold myself back, I slid my hands under his shirt, felt the satin-steel of his muscled torso, and explored his broad chest. Chris sat up to pull me into his lap, my legs around his waist, our clothes the only thing keeping us from doing what our minds couldn’t prevent. His hands grasped my hips with a grip of iron, and I dared to let *the focus* slide into place.

*Wow.*

My senses sharpened, my skin alive with an electric sensation, every touch like a bomb inside my mind. I’d only ever used my capabilities for serious purposes, and they had proven very powerful in that effect, but this was an entirely new world that I didn’t know I needed. I could feel his desire tense in the skin of his chest under my palms, tasted it in his kiss, smelled it in that chocolate cologne that I wanted to drown myself in. His body moved against mine, enough strength in his muscles to rip into me like one of the Breach-adapted tigers from New Wilderness, but I could feel him holding back, his touches gentle and light. Every bit of me coiled like a spring, ready to pounce on him, and I trembled from head to toe.

“Wait.” His voice was husky and breathless, Chris’s face and neck taking on a sheen of red that looked splotchy in places from his own desire.

“No.” I kept my eyes shut, too desperate and afraid to let go. “Don’t stop. Please, Chris, just don’t stop.”

“We need to.” He worked against me now, untangled my stubborn arms from around his neck in patient sternness. “You need to rest. I don’t want to hurt you.”

Gritting my teeth in tense frustration, I tried to tackle him backward onto the mattress. “You’re not hurting me.”

For a brief moment, I gained the upper hand, landing astride him enough to cling to Chris’s toned form with all four of my shaking limbs. His resistance eased at my body pressed so close to his, an intimate position we’d never gotten to before. Both his calloused hands slid over me, hungry as mine were, and he pulled me into a kiss that made me feel ready to black out.

In a flash, the world rolled, and I was on my back, arms and legs still wrapped around him, our valiant clothes the only things aiding in Chris’s restraint.

“Do you love me?” He caught and held me down with his weight, Chris’s blue eyes sparking with a fierceness that brought my mindless urges to a standstill. Had I disappointed him? Of course, it had been wrong of me to tease him like this, especially when we’d both agreed to abide by his standards for waiting until marriage. Chris was doing his best to take care of me, and here I was, making it that much more difficult. It was a cruel thing to tempt a man willing to wait until he had a ring, and I felt enormously guilty at being so selfish.

*That’s the last thing he needs to distract him at a time like this.*

Still, he waited on my response, and something moved behind my ribs, that same need, but even deeper, a longing for him in a way that went beyond a kiss, touch, or embrace.

“With all my heart.” I breathed, staring up into his shimmering irises with mine, and my heart pounded in nervous beats.

He paused, his gaze traveled my face, and Chris leapt from the bed to dash across the room.

With the same ferocity he’d restrained between the sheets, Chris tore into his knapsack, which leaned next to mine against the far wall. Flinging various objects left and right, he searched for something as though his very life depended on it.

Part of me wondered if it was a condom or some other form of birth control, and as my rational thinking returned, so did a nervous apprehension. True, I definitely wanted him, but now that I had time to cool my raging hormones, I admitted to myself that I had as much experience in this as a carboard box. If we were going to finally do this, I discovered that I really *did* want it to be a special moment, one reserved for when I could claim his name as my own, like I’d always been taught by my mother. Even if they weren’t here, I wanted to make my parents proud, and something about making my first time as simple as getting a morning coffee didn’t feel right. Besides, with the momentary break between our entanglement, I could also feel the soreness in my bruises, my body unhappy with my decision to dump an industrial plant on it.

*If I say I’ve changed my mind, will he be mad? Can I even say no at this point? He wouldn’t hurt me, I know that, but to get him all worked up only to stop . . .*

I looked up to see him standing in front of me on the carpeted floor, in his rumpled T shirt and athletic shorts, determined eyes fixed on me. His left hand was balled around something, and I tensed, half ready to hide under the covers to avoid the inevitable confrontation.

“You mean more to me than anyone ever has.” He caught my gaze with a burning desire in his that left me breathless. “And I’ve almost lost you far too many times. When we were driving you to the hospital, I swore to myself that I wouldn’t make that mistake again, so . . . I went hunting.”

Confused, I cocked my head to one side, covers pulled to my stomach. “Hunting?”

“I figure I’ll owe someone quite a bit once the shop owners come back, but it’s worth it.” Chris dropped to one knee to reveal a little red velvet box in his unclenched fist, in which sat a silver ring with a small clear diamond set into the band. “I know I should have waited for a fancy dinner, or a nice sunset, but . . . Hannah Elizabeth Brun, will you marry me?”

Time slammed to a halt, every nervous thought vanished, and my mind exploded like a hand grenade. All my life, I’d been the skinny wallflower, the girl on the outside, the nobody who couldn’t work up the courage to talk to boys. Even with my rise to an officer in the Rangers, I’d still been self-conscious of my romantic accomplishments at times, felt inferior, ugly, clumsy. To be here with Chris, to see his hopeful face waiting on my answer with a ring in his hand, made my entire universe turn upside down.

“Hannah?” He made a nervous half smile, and I realized my mouth was hanging open, no sound coming out.

*Don’t you dare screw this up, Hannah Brun, so help me God, don’t you dare screw this up.*

Gazing into those sky-blue orbs that made my heart soar, I fought a new wave of tears, this one borne purely from joy, and nodded. “Yes. Yes, I’ll marry you.”

The look on his face made everything that much better, his winning smile like a ray of golden sunshine. Chris rose to come to me, and I flung myself off the bed in a happy bounce.

My foot caught in the tangle of blankets, and instead of sailing into his arms with grace, I stumbled into him with a surprised yelp, the two of us crashing to the carpet together.

We both exploded with laughter, red-faced kids who had no idea what they were doing but were dead set on doing it anyway. Without skipping a beat, Chris swept me up in his arms and I clung to him, dizzy visions of our future enough to wash away the evil tendrils of my nightmare.

*Should we have three kids, or two? I’m okay with three. We can plan our house in New Wilderness, once it’s rebuilt, or even Ark River. A nice log cabin with bookshelves wall-to-wall, and a big fireplace, and a soft bed covered in furs. We can spend the weekends working in the garden together, maybe even start a farm. I’d like a farm.*

Taking my left hand in his, Chris slid the little silver ring onto my finger. It fit a little loose, but I wouldn’t have traded it for the world.

“I love you.” I kissed his rose-petal lips, feeling like I could burst from the giddiness in my soul.

Chris brushed my tears away with his thumb, his forehead pressed to mine. “And I love you, *pragtige*.”

Doing my best not to disrupt the wonderful moment, I glanced back at the nearby bedstead and sighed in wistful melancholy. “So, I take it we’re done with *that* until the wedding?”

“Sadly, yes.” Chris got up to lift me into his arms, carrying me to bed with an ornery grin to counteract his ceremonious tone. “But the way I see it, a man’s got a right to torment his woman within the proper boundaries. That is, if you don’t mind, Miss Brun.”

Pulse quickening, I reached to pull him down with me, the covers burying us in a sea of cotton bliss. “By all means, Mr. Dekker.”",2,1736478504.0,u_RandomAppalachian468,0,1.0,False

1hxuwxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hxuwxy/need_outsideobjective_perspective_long_post/,Need outside/objective perspective. Long post. ,"I’ll try to give as brief an overhaul as possible. 

My husband and I have been married almost 11 years. He’s Canadian I’m American. I sponsored him to come to America. Originally he wanted me to go to Canada, but it’s too cold and depressing there and he agreed and he knew that there was no way I could leave my family and be that isolated and also it was way way more expensive to go to Canada. 

At the time we were supposed to have a little farm that the USDA was going to help us pay for, but that didn’t work out. now we live in my sister‘s house with her and my mother. The house is not tidy. My mother is a bit of a hoarder, my sister is a bit of a slob, and I have such bad OCD that I can’t function in a mess so the house is always a disaster. My husband is frustrated with it and says he’s gonna leave me and that my mom and sister and I are all crazy and retarded and lazy and etc.

The thing is is that I try so so hard. But I’m like the only one who will ever cook or clean or take out the dogs or feed the dogs or clean up after the dogs etc. my husband works from home and he stays in his office or our bedroom only. He won’t even leave the front door unless I’m there with him. He doesn’t have a drivers license or know how to drive. He doesn’t manage any of the bills or anything like that. 

He expects me because I don’t work to handle all of the household chores, make all of the food, and do all of the tasks that involve our animals (we have three cats, one of which is handicapped and needs help into the cat box and is constantly having accidents, and six dogs three of them are still puppies and going through puppy training, and two of whom are senior and incontinent)

I feel like every day is spent literally cleaning up crap and piss and taking care of chores and making sure he has food. I miss working, but I stopped after Covid my 10 year job. I’m trying to finish school. My grandmother wants to pay for it, but he says it takes too much time away from all the other stuff I have to do : taking care of the housework and finding a way to get us the F out of this house.

I have been trying for six years to find a way for us to move out, but our finances are screwed. Because he never handles any of it, he refuses to, it’s all my fault and everything is on my shoulders. We don’t make enough money for everything that we have And I’m killing myself, trying to make things work and to take care of him and our animals and my disabled mother and sister.

I also have severe depression, OCD, anxiety, PTSD, and a slew of chronic health conditions and it feels overwhelming just to get out of bed every day. I’m constantly on alert, trying to make sure that the dogs don’t make too much noise or the cats don’t meow too loud or that anything wakes him up when he’s trying to sleep. My sleep my health, my diet. Everything is screwed up and I’m bending over backwards, trying to figure out how to make things the way he wants them

He thinks that I should just be able to fix all of these things, including right now our hot water heater and gas for the house. Heat are broken and he wants me to just fix it or make it get fixed, but none of us have the money for it and he won’t help And he just expects it to be fixed. And he says that I’m ignoring it or that myself and my mother and sister have executive function disorder because we can’t just call somebody and get it fixed, but are constantly trying to find other ways to do things.

Right now he’s pissed off at me because he woke up late at like 6 PM on his day off and even though it seemed OK for a minute cause we were cuddling he asked if I had plans for dinner and I said I was going to make steamed broccoli and macaroni and cheese and grilled sausage . I thought that he would like that because he’s like a child first of all but also because that’s his favorite foods, his favorite vegetable and his favorite foods. But he just laughed and said OK what are you really making because that’s like a joke

Then he started going off about how this is the last year and he doesn’t have it in him to wait around and I need to fix everything and stop making excuses and went into his usual how I keep him worse than a dog and he’s incapable of doing any of this because we’ve made it that way. (my Mother sister and I )

He always says that he can’t contribute anything because he can’t be out here with the rest of us and stuff because of the way the house is. And he can’t talk to my mother and sister or anything because it would just be explosive and I’ve told him not to do that. But I keep asking him to just be my partner and help me and recognize that not everything can be fixed and that if he wants to make food or something, then he should be doing it and that it’s not anybody else’s fault that he can’t leave his office or room

Then he tells me I’m just like a toddler and Etc that I’m always flipping everything around on him and blah blah blah. Just FYI, I have never yelled at him or cursed at him. And even when he’s yelling and cursing at me, I always make sure that he has food and is fed And has anything else he needs. I keep his office stocked with a mini fridge and microwave and toaster oven and coffee pot. He has a burner and a pan and I wash dishes and bring them to him and keep burritos and Ramen and sandwich makings and etc. for the Office.

I feel like I don’t have the energy or the time to do everything that he wants for me and that he expects me to just wave some magic one and fix things. I feel like he wants a mother. And I know that in many ways, he’s just like a child and I love him and I’m trying to take care of him, but I’m freaking exhausted And I don’t know if he’s right and I’m just keeping him worse than a dog and that I’m abusing him and that I took him away from his family and that I’m the worst mistake he’s ever made. Etc. etc. etc..

I know that I could be a better house maker and that I could keep the house clean or that I should at least, but I feel thwarted  every direction every second of every day. I feel like he expects more than as possible and he always tells me that no normal person would do this or that, but I’m just one person.",1,1736478491.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I have a part time job at a coffee shop and work about 30-40 hours a month. I make more than enough to eat out often with friends while saving a chunk of my money. I hit well above my saving goals last year and figured I should treat myself to something nice. I always wanted a new phone every since I started working because mine is old and laggy and doesn't run games that well. I have alot of money left over even after putting a big chunk into savings and want to spash big on a phone. The problem is that my parents started freaking out when I mentioned the price(about 1100 cad) and they started saying things like ""you should think more about the family"" or that Christmas just happened so you should wait because that's how western culture is about spending. My dad on the other just flat out rejected my idea and said I should not waste my money on a phone because a phone is only meant for call and chatting so why the hell would I need a 1000 dollar phone. I feel very violated about this as I feel that I don't have any power in what I can spend my hard earned cash on. What should be the next step for me is? They also said they don't want me to pay in full because that's not how finances work here in the west. But the problem is that no carriers here have a plan with the phone I want(I think this part is just my parents not wanting me to switch away from the current brand I'm using). So I'm kinda at a lost here. Both my parents here are acting like they will have treat me alot to let me buy this phone with my money.

Fortunately I was able to borrow one from a neighbor in the townhouse next to mine. I cleaned up his and 3 others (elderly) parking spaces and their cars following the storm as I was off due to the road conditions. Trying to be a nice guy. I return home from work on tuesday to find that all of those spots are taken. I work 12 hour shifts. so be it, I slid into a spot I could get my sedan into as there are no assigned spots. I walked out in the morning to find the spot next to mine cleared, with a car parked in it and all of the snow piled on and around my vehicle. I then poured my sweet tea(gotten away from coffee) on their windshield in anger. And was able to maneuver my car out of the spot. Since then I have aquired a snow shovel and have been clearing off others parking spots nightly and repeatedly burying that neighbors car. When I get home I find their car unburried and go straight into re burying it. I am fairly certain they have me on camera doing it. I left a note tonight on the giant birm in front of their spot on a piece of cardboard that if they fuck with my car i will contune to do this nightly. Bottom line, maybe just don't be a dick or you get dicked. I placed a camera in my dash facing their spot and have been going out each hour to see if any changes have occurred. I re buried it while they were gone. I wonder what tomorrow will hold. ",221,1736478380.0,pettyrevenge,18,0.98,False

My partner bought me 3 chicks for my birthday in August and I've had the pleasure of hand raising these babies. They are now all grown up, laying daily and bring me SO. MUCH. JOY. 

Like, I have spent the last 30 mins walking around the house doing chores with Blossom under my arm having a conversation with her. I thought I'd share a few of my favourite things they do...

1) They tell me in no uncertain terms that they are ready for their morning strawberries (a recent development) while I have my coffee. But I must hold said strawberries to make nibbling easier. If they touch the ground, we get upset. 

2) They spend the majority of their day on the step of my kitchen door so they don't miss the opportunity to skip inside and make a mad dash for the comfiest spot on the back of the couch! I pretend I don't notice them (they're not ""allowed"") and sit down on the couch which delights them even more because the MOST comfy spot (my lap) just opened up!

3) I've recently taught them to jump on command (amongst other tricks) so when I collect eggs in the morning they form a little circle around me and jump in the hope of treats. They make me feel like a Disney princess!

I have had some pretty ick health issues the last year and have made an effort to make my home the most comfortable, nurturing place for me to recover. These girls and my two dogs are so much a part of that. I just adore them so freaking much and needed to gush about it. 

Please share the silly, quirky things your babies do! I'd love to hear. ",49,1736478258.0,BackYardChickens,7,0.98,False

They have very high expectations for how front desk staff are supposed to behave; excessively polite, always standing, and the front desk is never unattended. If you need to take a bathroom break, there's no putting up a Be Right Back sign. You need to get someone to cover the desk.

Well, one day I ate a bad lunch plus too much coffee and things were just not sitting right in my stomach, and things were gurgling. I was trying to get someone on the radio to come and at least stand at the desk but people kept coming up to check in and next thing I know there's a big rush, and I'm the only person checking in like 4 people, plus dealing with the phone calls, plus holding in the terrible need to shit.

I finish the last check in and I think I've got it under control while evening maintenance guy comes down to watch the desk...but I still need to let out just a little fart to relieve the pressure.

That was my mistake.

While I'm on the phone with some guest who is grilling me about a cancellation fee, a giant brown shit stain seeped through my pants and ran a little down my leg. The smell was just intolerable, and the feeling was unforgettable.

Obviously I know that having a lot of caffeine isn’t good for you so I have switched over to tea and I’m actually not drinking much, if any, caffeine at all anymore. However, I love hot drinks so much that I have been drinking 5 to 6 cups of herbal tea a day. I usually have a blend that includes peppermint, chamomile and spearmint among others. When I came across the information about herbal tea, it said to avoid peppermint and chamomile in large amounts. Well, I think 5 to 6+ cups a day is probably considered a large amount. I have PCOS as well, so I know other things could have been the cause of the miscarriage, but I’m wondering if all of this tea that I’m drinking played a role.

I started with an Aeropress and quite honestly have never gotten along with it so it’s sat in my cupboard. The second brewer I got was a trusty plastic V60 02 off Amazon and it’s been amazing for the last 5/6 during my time with specialty coffee. 

I have my brews down to a T. I use Lance Hendricks method of 20G to 300ml water - 60g bloom for 2 mins with a spoon agitation after pouring. Then a steady pour until 300g water reached. Usually brew at 95C for most beans I get - tend to always have good results and am scared to change too much. 

I grind fairly course on a Timemore C3 Pro. I tend to never adjust my grinder coz most of the time I’m happy with my coffee. 

HOWEVER - I’ve never owned a flat bottom brewer and have had like 3/4 friends tell me to get the Orea V4 coz they love the results. 

My big question is am I missing out on much with a flat bottom brewer? Am I just stuck in my ways and like the coffee I get from the V60 that I don’t wanna change? 

I’m pretty keen to hear from people who own the V4 and are enjoying it against a V60 and those who have invested all the money into an Orea setup and not used it more than their V60 (I keep thinking about a grinder update and feel like the money I’m spending on an Orea with filters and tools that I could probably get the K6)

Free People, 50% off, snagged em in both colors, I love and adore them! Ultra thin, best for summer but idc.. The cuffs on the sleeves are so pretty and delicate and sweet made from a different fabric. The buttons rounded and covered in soft cloth… remember those type of buttons.. snd the waistband made of the same material. I bought one of the Olive and two sets in the other color way. The first review was negative. She stated that they tore in the washing machine. I’ll hand wash and dry them. I hope FP will come out with different colors, but I doubt it. 

Finny had a very nice dinner 🍽️ tonight. After not eating for almost 2 days 😩 he devoured his meal. My baby was hungry! So he occasionally has gas and when that happens, he won’t eat. It doesn’t happen too often but it does happen, and it freaks me out because I can hear his tummy from across whatever room we’re in. Whole roasted chicken in the oven. I give him both white meat (breast) and dark meat mixed because he won’t eat one without the other. He won’t just eat white meat won’t just eat dark meat, but when combined, he loves it! Sweet potatoes 🍠 and a couple spoonfuls or rice. 

I caved and bought a Nespresso coffee maker. So at work, they have a professional Nespresso coffee maker snd I fell in love with their Nocciola pods. Nocciola is a beautiful nutty hazelnut coffee. I thought I was over flavored coffees… nerrrp! Their blend, this blend in particular is so so beautiful, I could cry. 🥹 Nocciola only comes in the original pods, but the machine I purchased is a newer model called a Vertuo, and they don’t sell the Nocciola pods to fit the Vertuo Next model… Soooo I had to buy the coffee pods compatible w my model. Thankfully, they sell a hazelnut that’s compatible with my machine. I based my coffee machine purchase off this flavored coffee, that’s how insanely ahhmazing it is. 

So I went a lil overboard, nothing new. Downloading the Nespresso app after said machine arrived in perfecto condition. Along with a free Nespresso milk frother, and a 12 piece free coffee pod taste tester, their best sellers… 4 espresso pods, 2 double espresso pods, 2 grand lungo, snd 4 regular coffee pods. It looked like a grown up variety of Valentine’s Day chocolate set, so pretty! The jacket I wanted from Macys was cancelled from my order after no longer being in stock… Sooo Macy’s was lovely enough to send me a 25% off coupon code for my next purchase. That coffee maker went into my basket immediately! Arrived the same day my first coffee order arrived, on this past Saturday night, I had to hook it up asap. Pair it on my phone to the app, super easy. Set up took less than 10 min. 

Their Vertuo coffee pods are only compatible with specific models. Like I couldn’t use a keurig coffee pod with this machine, which sucks because this means I am limited to the Nespresso coffee line. But! Starbucks Blonde espresso has teamed up w Nespresso and carries this blend in their pods. I CAN purchase empty pods from Amazon and fill them with my own coffee I grind at home, but I’m still so in love with what I have. It’s all so new and discovering their different varieties of coffee is so much fun. And I find that I don’t get the jitters with their coffees like I do with my beloved Starbucks house blend! ALSO I’m happy to report, the model I chose has a nice feature where you’re able to pull a shorter cup of coffee (making it stronger) from a regular coffee pod. I find the Nocciola ever so slightly different than the hazelnut fit for the vertuo model. Discovering that I am able to cut the water in half doubles its strength, so it’s customizable and I’m able to basically pull an espresso shot from a single coffee pod! That is a fucking game changer!! This means all the coffee I ordered can basically become espresso if I do chose with the double click of a button.. 😩

Ok sooo lol this is what I ordered the first time ordering their coffee from the app.. Like I said, they are pods, so they’re sold in sleeves. My 1st order was 2 sleeves of roasted hazelnut, 2 sleeves of their rich chocolate, 1 sleeve of sunny almond vanilla flavored over ice (a double espresso recommended enjoying over ice) and 1 sleeve of their double espresso dolce., finally 1 sleeve of the sweet vanilla. They are all so beautifully curated.. Technically I did not order just their regular coffee pods. Snagged their flavored coffee blends and a sleeve of just one of their unflavored espressos ☕️

Here’s where things get a lil confusing. 🫤 The pods come in different sizes to pull different sized drinks (cups of coffee) Espresso yields 1.35 fluid ounces, double espresso, 2.7 ounces, gran lungo, 5.07 ounces, coffee.. 7.77 ounces..  etc. you get the gist, right. When I went on the socials to research the machine I bought (only after I ordered it lol) I didn’t think too much about the special feature in being able to pull a shorter cup of the regular coffee, their 7.77 ounce.. however, after trying out all the flavors, I realized that they were a bit watered down for my liking. I like or I’m used to a medium/slightly stronger roast.. annd now I’m realizing, for morning coffee, I can pull a regular cuppa hazelnut and add a shorter shot of another hazelnut pod to it! 💃🏻Total game changer like I said. There are bar codes on each pod that informs the machine how much water to use. So no messing around with different settings to yield different types of sizes. Wonderful for espresso, double espresso, regular coffee and larger cups of coffees… 

I am to the moon with my new little contraption!! Yeah, yeah, it’s just coffee… but you guys know how I love and adore coffee. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there is something so romantic 🥰 about coffee to me. I can’t find the words! Sooo, I kinda put in a second order 🤷🏻‍♀️ It shipped same day and arrived less than 24 hrs later. Happy to say, I can place an order for same day pick up. Nespresso has a few stores in my area, but I opted for free shipping. They shipped from Kearny New Jersey, so that’s why it arrives so quickly. This time, I ordered several sleeves of the sunny almond vanilla over ice annnd the peppermint pinwheels only because they’re both limited edition. Had to snag more hazelnut, and try the Costa Rica 🇨🇷 blend because that’s what was especially good in the sampler pack.. So far, I’m all about the flavored blends. Will venture out and discover different blends and sizes, but for now, just so in love w the roasted hazelnut still. It’s like an adult version of hazelnut I cant quite figure out yet. Lerrrvvvv… lol. 😝

1hxuc5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1hxuc5e/herbal_tea_linked_to_miscarriage_and_i_had_no_idea/,Herbal tea linked to miscarriage and I had no idea?? ,"I recently had my second miscarriage in two months (one in November 2024 and one right before new years), and am in the process of waiting for HCG to go down. Anyway, while mentally and physically preparing myself to try again after we get some testing done, I came across some info that I’ve never heard before: herbal tea is linked to miscarriages (!?!?!). Of this I had no idea. Prior to TTC my husband and I were coffee addicts and consumed a lot of caffeine every day. Obviously I know that having a lot of caffeine isn’t good for you so I have switched over to tea and I’m actually not drinking much, if any, caffeine at all anymore. However, I love hot drinks so much that I have been drinking 5 to 6 cups of herbal tea a day. I usually have a blend that includes peppermint, chamomile and spearmint among others. When I came across the information about herbal tea, it said to avoid peppermint and chamomile in large amounts. Well, I think 5 to 6+ cups a day is probably considered a large amount. I have PCOS as well, so I know other things could have been the cause of the miscarriage, but I’m wondering if all of this tea that I’m drinking played a role. Has anyone talked with their doctor about drinking herbal teas in the first trimester? ",2,1736476687.0,Miscarriage,6,1.0,False

1hxubxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/innout/comments/1hxubxy/should_i_contact_hr/,Should I contact HR?,"For context I've been working for in n out for about 5 months already, I got hired and at the beginning it was all good, I was only getting around 2 days a week for work and 2 hours a day. After a few months I told my Store Manager that I was going through very bad times and really needed money for rent so I asked her if I could have more hours to which she said if I leveled up I could eventually but not now (by the time I already took orders on the windows I was still Lvl 1.) After a few months I got level 2 and started working on the lanes, still barely any hours (this never got better) my training was like 1 day and I barely learned anything but how to take orders and hand them out, the communication words, codes, etc, none of that was taught to me and I had to learn by watching others and by getting yelled at. I only was taught how to make tomatoes and that was it, then they would ask me to brew a coffee/tea, cut lemons, etc and get mad at me because I didn't know how to use the machines. I put up with all this either way because I need the job and the money

Later on I get my first write up for being short 5$ and a few cents, this was while my drawer was being shared by a bunch of associates and to be honest I was barely on my drawer, I tell my manager this and she says there is nothing I can do and that I'm still responsible for the money missing and that when I got hired I signed a paper accepting the responsibility for this, I say ok and we move one. 

I got 2 complaints in the span of a few months from customers both saying I was not friendly to them / gave them dirty looks (I don't remeber none of this happening but I accept it) so I tell ny managers I'll do better and be extra friendly so I can do a good job at work, I put the hard work, I smile a lot and do my best to give good customer service, one of the regulars told me I was doing great and that they will call to compliment my work. I don't want to sound prideful but i think i do a good job and most of my interactions are very good, regulars remeber me and i even got a gift once, they have tried to give me tips 3 times and ive kindly declined and in general i get a lot of in person compliments about my service. 

While this happenes I move cities because rent was too high and I never got more hours so I ask my manager to transfer, she says to talk to the new store so I do, they say they do accept transfers and that they will talk to my manager about it, I never got any updates or any help to transfer. I also never got the compliment acknowledged and I felt very frustrated by this because I worked extra hard to do better, my manager tells me she will cut my hours and not let me level up because of the last complaint I received and this will be until I improve, which I have been.

Then I get another write up one day randomly,  I get told I was short on cash for charging the wrong car on a random day last month, I was never told about this or aware of the situation and I don't even remeber this incident, every time I have a drawer I ask if I am OK on it and I always make sure they say I'm good before I leave home, that's why this is so random, 

Now today, I have a customer to which I start reading their order and they say they can't hear me because I'm wearing a mask (we are all wearing masks because of the Air quality here) so I get close to him and ask for confirmation for each of the things in the order, 1 burger with whole grilled onions, yes? 1 fry, 1 pink lemonade... etc. He confirms everything so I charge him, right after I put the card in he says, also a root beer right? I say, no, then he says his order is wrong and he asked for 2 burgers, I talk to the manager to get him a refund and charge the correct order. He says no and that he dosent want to and he just wants his food. The manager tells me to just give them the order and that I'll only be short $4 , I do as they tell me even though in confused about this. At the end of the day (and must I say my drawer was on a windows that I was not all during my whole shift after that) the manager tells me I'm $14 short, I give her the receipt from the wrong order they told me to keep and they said they won't void it and that I'll get a write up, I say this is unfair because this issue could be easily fixed and that this wasn't my fault. She says she dosent care and that they have talked to me about charging the wrong car before (the order I don't remeber about)

Anyway, I'm super frustrated by this and I really just wanted to do good at my job so I could transfer to a store closer to my new home and I keep getting nit picked and they seem to create a new rule every time I do something, i feel like they really don't like me but they also don't want to let me transfer. I am afraid of loosing my job but I also feel like this is unfair. Am I wrong?

They also didn't let me wear some pink stud earrings I had because they were pink but one of the managers wears some that are blue 😭 i haven't complained about any of this because I try to avoid confrontation,  I'm just saying this is all weird.",0,1736476671.0,innout,12,0.43,False

Good to see. With the new parking law, any new development isn't required to have a parking lot attached to the development. I think a few more (a lot more, 😉) ""new built"" developments are coming. Good things ahead.

*A hotel developer is planning to build a Hilton-branded hotel at The Heaviest Corner on Earth.*

*Ascent Hospitality is designing a Tempo by Hilton hotel to be located at 1912 First Ave. N., near the intersection of 20th Street North, according to Denise Vanderpool, regional director of operations for Ascent.*

*The project is still in a design phase, Vanderpool told the BBJ, and is slated to open by 2029. Initial plans already show the hotel will have approximately 180 rooms, a restaurant and bar and a coffee shop.*

*The property is currently a parking lot that neighbors two of Ascent’s existing hotels, Fairfield Inn & Suites Birmingham Downtown and the Elyton Hotel.*

*Fifth Dimension Architecture & Interiors is involved in the project.*

*Hilton’s Tempo brand focuses on accommodating activity and wellness, sometimes including Peloton equipment in rooms. The brand only has four hotels open in the United States. A location in Raleigh opened in the summer of 2024 and is dually branded with Homewood Suites, according to the Triangle Business Journal.*

*According to Hilton, 52 Tempo hotels are in development, including a forthcoming location in San Diego.*

*Ascent Hospitality also is currently developing a 337-room, dual-brand AC and Element by Marriott in the historic Brown Marx Tower, built in 1906, on the opposite side of 20th Street North from the Tempo site.*

It reminds me of the story in the Bible where they basically were selling coffee table books (cattle, sheep, doves, etc.) in the temple and Jesus was like ""what the heck is going on here.""

I don’t understand why people keep insisting otherwise with no proof and nothing but speculation from people who just blindly regurgitate it,"
A 2019 press release mentions McDonald’s has been using Mother Parkers since at least 1990:

> We are so proud of our ongoing partnerships and Mother Parkers’ role in the McFamily for over 30 years.

https://web.archive.org/web/20190208202810/https://www.mother-parkers.com/our-story/our-press-releases/mcdonalds-john-betts-congratulations/

And even though that is 6 years old, McDonald’s still has Mother Parkers on their website:

> Trusted Brands — We shop where our guests shop – our basket is just a bit bigger! McDonald’s buys and serves the same wholesome foods our guests use at home, supplied by brand name companies Canadians know and trust such as Cargill, Coca-Cola, Danone, McCain, Minute Maid, **MOTHER PARKERS**, Nestle, Quaker, Saputo.

The Tim Hortons CEO also squashed the bs here:

> Tim Hortons wants you to know that it did not sell any aspect of its closely-guarded coffee recipe – including its supplier, blends and beans – to its competitor, McDonald’s.- “I don’t know why this story originated, or how it grew the way it did, but I can 100 per cent confirm that it is a myth,

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-hortons-did-not-sell-coffee-recipe-to-mc-donalds-194810309.html?guccounter=1

So why does Tim’s coffee suck now? I don’t know, maybe because they were bought out by a company looking to cut costs resulting in a crappier product? Or maybe all the TFW’s don’t care and you have rose-tinted glasses on? Or maybe because Tim’s decided to build their own roasting plants which has changed the taste: 

Bought their own plant in 2001: https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/2017/11/15/who-knew-tim-hortons-coffee-roasted-rochester/863188001/

They built their another plant. Article from 2009: https://company.timhortons.com/us/en/corporate/news-release.php?id=5892

Ignoring all that, the recipe is considered proprietary. 

> In fact, he says, there are just three employees in the company that actually know the formula for blending and roasting the Tim Hortons coffee that goes into a double-double.

…

> “Our coffee recipe is the most valuable asset in the entire company,” Hancock said. “We have not sold or shared any part of our coffee business with any competitor.”

Meaning McDonald’s can’t just walk into Mother Parkers and say “gib me tim recipe plz thnx”. That’s not how it works.

Bathroom. Coffee. Drop gear in the Arby's. Go get cold breakfast burritos. Microwave.  Back to gear. A little reddit. Breakfast done. Outside to smoke. Back in to wait out the cold and charge my phones. Thought about yesterday for a minute. 'WTF? That was a new one! What a wingnut. Put it out of your mind. Done.'

'This coffee has me wired for sound! It's warming up a little.' Check weather. 37 degrees. Almost 10:00am. 'Time to get this show on the road."" Gear on. Out to onramp. Not too busy, but steady.

Two hours later a car pulls over. ""Just wanna let you know, for my safety, I've got a loaded 45 right here."" ""No worries."" ""Ok. Get in."" Gear in. Me in. ""Thanks for stopping."" ""Yeah man. No problem.""

Dude proceeds to tell me about how his son is out of control on meth. ""He gets in these rages when he comes down. I'm disabled. He'd fuckin' kill me if he got a hold of me!

He's talking. I'm listening, adding the appropriate responses throughout. He goes 60 miles past where he's going. Figures it out. Drops me off when he turns around.

'Shit. I'm on the wrong highway.' Maps. 'Everything goes to Mobile from here. Maybe there's a reason I wound up on this road. I'm in the middle of nowhere. Nothing around. Lots of cars go by for the next couple hours. 'I definitely don't want to be stuck here tonight. It's gonna rain tomorrow all day. I need to get near some food, get my tent setup, and hunker down.'

It's a little after 4:00pm. Clouds are rolling in from the storm that's coming. It's starting to get dark. 'I do not want to be here in my tent for the next fourty-eight hours.'

Can you give me a ride just to a gas station or a small town."" ""Ok. Do you mind getting in the back? I have a baby in here."" ""No worries."" Gear in truck bed. Me in truck bed. We're off. I feel like I'm going the wrong way but I'm gonna just see where I wind up. Watching maps.

'We're back on the highway I need. Sweet!' I feel a turn. Tap on glass. Point down. Get a nod. We pull into a shopping center with a walmart and bunch of places to eat, a dollar store... Everything I might need. 'Awesome!'

She proceeds to call a church to find me some help. I'm not really into it, but might as well let her try. Numbers exchanged. ""You're all set. You can go into walmart. Use the bathroom. Warm up. They'll call you.""

I head to walmart. Smoke a cigarette. Phone rings. ""Why didn't you go to the shelter?"" ""I didn't know where I was. I was trying to not get knocked off course. Ok. That's cool. You don't need me. I'll  text you a number. Call them. If it doesn't work out call me back."" ""Will do."" I call.

Message: ""Text your address and how many in your party. We'll come get you."" 'Fuck it. I'll ask questions before I go.' Text address and number of people. Immediate text back. ""Give me 30-45 minutes."" Text back. ""Will do."" Go inside walmart to warm up. Reddit. Getting close to time. Better get a smoke in. 

Outside. Finish smoke. Van pulls up. ""You looking for a place to stay?"" ""Yeah. Couple questions. Can I smoke?"" ""Yeah."" ""Can I use my phone?"" ""Yeah."" ""Fair enough."" Gear in. Me in. ""Man, you were in the right spot. You're the easiest person I've ever found."" "" I figured I'd try and make it easy. "" Dude from yesterday calls. I silence phone. 'No way I'm talking to that guy.' No message. 

Get to talking. Tell dude I'm looking for work. ""You're the most intelligent guy I've ever dealt with. They're adding on to the place. I'm gonna hook you up with the guys doing the building.  They need someone like you."" 'As long as I'm getting paid. I'm not trying to get into a shelter program.' Get to shelter. Me out. Gear out. Intake. One hitter gets tossed. 'Fuck it.' Knife in backpack. Brief search. Get anything I need for the night out. Gear in bag. Bag taken to storage.

""Are you kicking us out in the rain tomorrow."" ""This is just for tonight. Tomorrow we'll take you anywhere you want to go. We'll get you a new sleepingbag too before you go."" 'That works. I'll go back to that walmart, pitch the tent if I need to, and be on my way again after the rain. Oh yeah first guy said they hand out greyhound passes. Have to look into that. Where do I want to go?' 

Get a cot. Everybody seems relatively chill. Sermon starts. Head guy asks if I need food ""Yes."" Eat. 'That was really good.' ""Do you need some more?"" ""Nah I'm good, thanks."" ""You need a shower?"" ""I'm good"" ""No you're not."" ""Fair enough."" "" You wanna wait until after sermon?"" ""Yeah."" I just wanted a minute to chill and take in my surroundings.

'I have no need to listen to this woman's long story about doing drugs and getting saved.' Outside. Smoke.

Got a warm bed, shower, food, and a ride to right where I need to be in the morning. It will probably be raining, but that's tomorrow's problem. 'What's that? Shit. It's starting to rain.' Back inside. Fire and brimstone is better than freezing rain sometimes...",93,1736475627.0,vagabond,12,0.99,False

It’s not always about how much they can give, and I’m very grateful that he’s done so for the last few years. He was over the moon with how appreciative I was, and it just really made me ponder the smaller things in life.

I’ve never bought a power station/generator before, so I’m just curious as to whether the River 2 is the way to go. Amazon has it and the 45w solar panel for $299 (I have $100 Amazon gift card as well).

Basically, I’m looking for something to allow simple charging in case of power outages. Typically if the power goes out it’s only for maybe 2 days maximum. I’m not looking to hook a tv/system/fridge up to it, pretty much just mine and my wife’s phones (maybe a kettle as well for coffee to keep her happy).

Share ko lang experience namin ung isang tindahan dito sa Taktak. Group of siklista kami and nag order kami ng silog dito sa tindahan na'to. After namin mag laps syempre mga gutom na kaya dito ung napili namin. Umorder ako ng hungarian sausage silog and the rest of the group ay tapa. Nung na serve na ung akin, excited ako and pag kagat ko, gulat gums ko ang lamig pa. 😭 Prito outside, frozen inside. Grabee sabi ko bakit ganun, nag bayad naman ako ng tama. Pati kape sablay. Ung cold brew ginawang hot coffee jusko 😭And Then lumapit ako dun sa nag serve sakin sabi nya lang "" ah frozen po? Okay palitan ko po"" nung natapos kami kumain walang apologies akong natanggap. Huhuhu 😭😭 

Nung nag leave ako ng review sa google,, mukang binura pa ata. Grabe feeling ko kasalanan ko pa. Or parang ang bad ng nagawa ko leaving a review like that. So far, my mga issue kaming naririnig about them and other stalls. Pero bahala na sila jan basta sana maayos next time ung pag seserve nyo.

1hxty8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hxty8k/day_1_again/,Day 1 Again,"I’m back. I successfully quit caffeine for about 3-6 months a while back. I then slowly started drinking coffee again. I am now trembling after drinking about a cup and I feel sick. 

So I’m posting this for accountability. I’ll try to check in every day for the first week and maybe give some thoughts about how I’m feeling that day, then maybe once every week after that. I’m gonna do a 30 day challenge because although my goal is to stop forever, it helps me to think of it as a shorter-term thing. 

So today is day 1 of 30, I guess. It’s around 6:20 PM on January 9, so starting now. 

Rules for me:

No caffeinated coffee or tea (decaf is ok for now, may change later because sometimes coffee itself gives me stomach issues, may edit this post later)

No chocolate, at all (I have my reasons lol)

No caffeinated soda at all, noncaffeinated is fine

No energy drinks or anything else with added caffeine

Reasons for quitting:

It cannot be good to feel so stimulated you cannot even type properly lol.

Feeling sick

Gives me insomnia!!

Makes me feel like I’m high (not in a good way)

For anyone that's doing their degree online, what's your routine like for classes and where do you study at? How do you guys socialize / make friends?

I did my associate's at a community college, on campus. Doing everything online has been harder such as not being able to interact with classmates, making friends, enjoying the ""college life"", and so on. The switch up has been hard. I've been spending my time studying for hours at my public library but it just feels ""weird"" (not in a bad way) to be studying there most of the time. I like having different scenery for studying. I've tried studying at coffee shops, but it gets really pricey, real quick. I'd study at a local CC but I felt awkward having to ask for a parking pass every 2 weeks : (

For context: my university is out of state, I moved states (for family / housing reasons) and am finishing my degree online (I have 2 years left, and it's cheaper than transferring credits + have tuition rates locked in). I know this was really stupid of me, but my university was in an extremely high COL area so I could barely afford housing too. I'm also in my early to mid 20s, so off-campus housing felt more age appropriate for me, hence why I'm online lol.",3,1736475453.0,college,1,1.0,False

I read something, only one place,  that said that the cotton construction of the Kono filters is pretty porous and provides a fuller body.  Do the cotton Kono filters tend to provide a fuller body?

Which, if any, filters let more of the oils pass through to provide a fuller body.  Yes, I understand that metal filters will do this, but I want a paper-ish filter that will more limit sediment in the cup, and also be biodegradable.  ",5,1736475299.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
