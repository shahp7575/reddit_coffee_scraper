I’m 25, living in the U.S., and on a journey to connect with like-minded souls. I’ve come to cherish the beauty in simplicity—the quiet joy of walking through a park, observing life as it unfolds, or sitting in a cozy corner enjoying a cup of coffee. I find meaning in the small, unnoticed things that others might overlook.

I live with a free-spirited outlook, letting people be who they are without judgment. I believe life is about understanding and appreciating differences rather than forcing conformity. For me, connection isn’t about flashiness or perfection—it’s about honesty, kindness, and the comfort of simply being understood.

I’m a mechanical engineer and a working professional, currently working remotely. While I enjoy the freedom of my days, I’d love to connect with someone who values meaningful conversations, shares a passion for the little things, and sees the beauty in the world’s quiet moments.

If we connect and it seems to grow into something more, I’m open to exploring where it could lead. It doesn’t matter where you are from—I believe good connections can cross any distance.

So, if you enjoy deep conversations, finding peace in the ordinary, and want to share perspectives on life, let’s talk. Whether it’s about big dreams, random thoughts, or simply how the day went, I’m here to listen, share, and create something meaningful.

Drop me a message if this resonates with you. Let’s see where our paths cross.",1,1735509535.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1hp70c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hp70c8/dont_know_how_to_help_my_friend/,Don’t know how to help my friend,"This is a kind of long story. My best friend of 12+ years we’ll call him Lyle has a brother, we’ll call him Jake. Lyle has always been my best friend and Jake has always been my friend but more son from a distance. Like we can’t really hangout 1 on 1 cause it just feels awkward. 

Lyle has never really been interested in dating and Jake always seemed to be the same. Weeks ago though Jake told me that he was “on a quest to find a girlfriend” this statement weirded me out like a lot. But I brushed it off as just cringey because he has always been a cringey guy. Later he was talking about the crush he has and told me that he “picked her because she was shy” this really weirded me out. That’s not how you talk if you’re seeking a healthy relationship. The more I think about him saying that the more dangerous it sounds. In the moment I didn’t really process it so I just told him it makes sense to be attracted to someone that acts like you. He’s a junior in college and me and Lyle are both freshman to also give an idea of why I found his statement scary. I don’t trust him enough to have faith in his ability to navigate relationships. He seems to be at a complete disconnect with his emotions. Lyle has also always seemed to not care or think of his emotions. 

To further the story Jake asked the girl out kind of indirectly. He asked her to go to get coffee and she said she already had plans with friends and did not ask to try and do it a different day. Jake asked me what this meant and I said she was letting him down easy but they can and should still be friends. This make Jake cry and I felt bad for him, he told me about how he got catfished online and blackmailed into giving them money. And to top all of it off his parents are getting a divorce. He is in a terrible situation. 

We are all in a friend group of like 6 people. All of it has made him cling to us as his friends and overall put a lot of strain on our relationships with him. Me and the rest of the friend group agree that we don’t know him enough to fully support him or say the right words. He feels like a mutual through Lyle to all of us. So he hasn’t been able to get the support he requires from us and this had made him start to get aggressive with us and overall it makes all of us uncomfortable. If me and Lyle make plans for just the two of us Jake will invite himself as an example. I hate it when people do that, and the last time he invited himself he was overly touchy with me and has also kept asking specifically for validation on things. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to help this guy and honestly don’t know what to do. Me and others agreed he needs to learn how to live on his own. But at the same time I would need support in his situation. I don’t know what to do or how to help him. But I need distance from him he feels overbearing at times. ",1,1735509425.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

However last night the family went out to the pub (including the wife) leaving me alone to my own devices. 
Sitting in my room I got a bit triggered (watching YouTube videos) so I bought some NA beers, Peroni and Carlsbergs, to see if it helped. I drank a couple of each and was perfectly happy, and went to bed shortly after.
I had avoided NA beers as I thought it would drive me back to drinking regular beer, but that wasn't the case it appeared. 
My enjoyment seemed to come from satisfying the habit I think. 
Can anyone else shed any light or experience on this? I don't want to think all is good and then get blindsided into needing regular beer. ",3,1735509405.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

Our kitchen/living area gets a lot of natural light so it wasn’t dark by any means, and everything felt normal. I turned to check the time on the oven when I saw a young man sitting on the couch. My initial reaction was that someone had gotten into the house, and panicked, but by the time it took me to double take he was gone. 

I remember what he looked like very clearly. He was sat on the couch up straight, and not fully leaned back into the cushions like an uncomfortable guest. He was around 13-15, a bit tall for his age I noticed, but no taller than 5’8”. He had on a dark blue button up shirt, dark slacks, and brown dress shoes, but nothing too fancy. His hair was brushed to the side out of his face but not perfectly. It almost looked like he was dressed for church or something along those lines. He had a very neutral look and feel about him, and was an average looking kid. 

It’s also important to note that we’ve experienced cups getting knocked over and such around the house, so we’ve known of a presence. We’ve always speculated that it was two; one playful but chill, and the other a bit dark and menacing. It doesn’t happen often, but we’ve experienced fleeting but overwhelming feelings of fear, like something’s stood right behind us. We don’t like that guy, but we don’t mind the other. 

I’ve also personally seen ghosts before and it’s always really interested me. I’ve been looking into missing persons in my area in search of a connection but no luck so far. I don’t want to get rid of him as much as I’d like to know more. Does anyone have any thoughts has to why he was so neutral presenting? Does anyone have any advice on making contact or have had similar experiences? Should I just get rid of the guy or continue ignoring them like we have been? I’m definitely interested in trying to communicate in order to learn more but I also understand the dangers that could hold, especially since he’s a young man. ",2,1735509182.0,Ghosts,0,1.0,False

1hp6v3j,https://i.redd.it/y13f4gcdzu9e1.jpeg,Why Having a Spiritual Community Matters (And It’s Not Just About Religion),"Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the importance of community when it comes to spirituality. Whether you’re into meditation, prayer, nature worship, or just figuring out the meaning of life, having people to connect with can make all the difference.

For me, spirituality is a deeply personal journey, but it’s also something that thrives when shared. Here’s why I think being part of a spiritual community, whatever that looks like for you is essential. 

1.	You’re Not Alone in the Deep Stuff
Life can get overwhelming, and let’s be real, not everyone in our daily lives wants to talk about the big questions like, “What’s my purpose?” or “Why are we here?” A spiritual community can give you a safe space to explore those ideas with people who actually get it.
	2.	Accountability and Growth
Ever tell yourself you’re going to meditate every day or journal about gratitude, and then… forget? (Yep, same.) Being part of a community keeps you motivated. Seeing others do the work inspires you to keep at it too.
	3.	Diverse Perspectives = Deeper Understanding
We all see the world through our own lens, but hearing how others experience the divine, universe, or spirit can challenge and expand your own beliefs in the best way possible.
	4.	Shared Energy is Powerful
There’s something undeniably energizing about being with people who are on a similar path. Whether it’s a group meditation, a candlelit service, or just chatting over coffee, shared energy can really fill your cup.
	5.	It’s About Connection, Not Conformity
Your community doesn’t have to share every belief you hold (how boring would that be?). It’s about finding people who respect your journey and walk alongside you on their own paths.

I know for some people, spiritual community brings up bad experiences from rigid or judgmental groups. I totally get that, and I’d encourage you to look for spaces that feel inclusive, open, and supportive. Whether that’s an online group, a local meditation circle, or even a close-knit friend group.

What’s been your experience with finding (or building) a spiritual community? Do you think it’s necessary, or do you prefer walking the path solo?

I get it, mornings are great for getting work done before everyone starts pulling you in different directions. But the start of your day should be something you’re genuinely happy to do.

It doesn’t have to be fancy—maybe it’s enjoying your favorite coffee, going for a walk or a run, spending 10 minutes in the sun, hanging out with your family, praying or meditating.

We had a great coffee date—lots of shared interests and humor. She seemed outgoing, funny, and easy to talk to, and I left feeling good about the connection. I told her I’d love to see her again and gave her my number in case she felt the same.  

A few days later, I got a text from her: “Hey, it’s Nicole! I meant to get back to you sooner, but my schedule has been a little crazy. I’m going to run some errands tomorrow around 3, wanna tag along?” I agreed, and we met up in a parking lot. After she finished at one store, I offered to drive us to the next one, which was about 10 minutes down the road.  

The ride was great—she complimented my music taste, and I was feeling optimistic about getting to know her better. At Target, I started goofing off a bit—lighthearted stuff like shooting items into the cart, jokingly holding up baby clothes, and making cheesy puns about sales signs. I wasn’t being overly loud or causing a scene; it was just my way of keeping things fun. I’m an animated person, and being silly is just part of who I am. Nicole seemed outgoing during our coffee date, so I thought she’d appreciate the vibe.  

At first, she seemed fine, but when I joked about trying on a pair of heels, she snapped, “Can you stop? You’re being so extra right now; it’s honestly ridiculous.” Her tone wasn’t playful—it was annoyed and sharp. I asked what was wrong, and she replied, “Seriously? We’re in a store.”  

I was caught off guard. She hadn’t said anything about feeling uncomfortable or embarrassed before, and again, she seemed really outgoing and laid back on our first date. If social anxiety was the issue, I wish she’d communicated it instead of insulting me. Her comment reminded me of my ex, who among other things, would belittle me. That relationship was really bad for me and it took a lot of therapy and hard work to rebuild my self-esteem.  

I took a breath, kept my tone calm, and said, ""How much battery does your phone have?” She said about 50%, again oddly agitated.  I said ""Cool. If my personality is too much, I hope you find someone who’s less."" then left.  

Her car was only 10 minutes away, we were in a safe area during the day, and she could call a friend or an Uber. Part of me wonders if I should’ve driven her back to her car, but didn’t want to sit in awkward silence or risk another backhanded comment. Being called an embarrassment on date two felt like a red flag, and I didn't want any part of that. 

It felt terrifying but empowering to stand up for myself. AITA?  ",2,1735508823.0,AITAH,19,0.63,False

So I have been married for about two years. Me (33M) and my wife (32F) are at loggerheads often. I am usually a shy person and take time to gel and mingle with people specially during get-togethers. My wife usually asks me to speak up and communicate so that I don't seem to be silent and I have been taking measures to try and speak and take active measures to break the ice amongst friends of friends and people (not total strangers but more like wife's friends or friends of friends) out but somehow she still isn't happy and complains.

Apart from that, she is not happy with my upbringing as I am not hygienic, don't eat healthy, have issues with my teeth, hair etc. I agree that I have a sweet tooth and at times like to indulge in some dessert, and she is not happy at all. The other day it started with one thing of me drinking coffee everyday (which is unhealthy since it has caffeine, according to her) and I drink 2 cups usually (although a bit larger that should be ~350 ml per cup) and she fired right away with all things bad that is I am, and I honestly feel lost.

On the coffee, I did mention of me not doing more and honestly I don't feel that I have excessive consumption of coffee that would affect my health. But then, it just becomes unbearable.

And the most hurtful thing happens is after hearing I'm looking behind my shoulder and thinking that I am so flawed and it's crushing my self esteem and confidence. She is all like I'm trying to have you improve coz your parents did not focus them but I think changing a personality under the garb of improving is a bit overwhelming. And I ask her to speak assertively and say you need to improve on these things but the condescending behavior and angry meltdown over everything that I am seems just a bit much more to handle. 
I know I have my flaws and actively work on it. In order to be fit, I have started hitting the gym regularly, cook meals to be helpful in household and other things.

But at this stage, there is this shouting match which begins and I just feel like running away. Maybe I'm overreacting but its just overwhelming and draining every ounce of my energy.",0,1735508388.0,Marriage,3,0.5,False

1hp6i5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1hp6i5z/does_this_sound_like_autism/,Does this sound like autism?,"Hello everyone,

I‘m wondering whether I may be on the spectrum or I‘m just „otherwise weird“. I know what people ln the internet think does not replace a proper diagnosis but I don‘t feel confident enough with this hunch I‘m having to actually get in touch with a professional. After all, I know that there are long waiting lists and certainly people who need it more.

So, I‘m a 25-year-old woman with a first degree in a STEM field, then switched to political science. I now work as a policy administration professional for regional government. My job is in the social sector and I appreciate that I can do something for people without having to actually interact with them. I also do a lot of charity work, being a member of organisations‘ boards and commissions. That brings me to both my social issues and my special interests.
I like people. But I like them from a distance, mostly. The big exception is my partner who while not exactly able to understand my social issues and other quirks,accepts me fir who I am; I don‘t feel like I have to play pretend around him. I can do smalltalk and that stuff but I really don‘t see the point of it and have learnt what is appropriate to say and what you should ask because that helps navigate professional settings. I‘m otherwise fine with (verbal) communication, though. I do a lot of public speaking, have no trouble understanding irony and word plays. It only happens occasionally that I take things to literally. I can handle social intersctions just fine as long as they are on known territory, i.e. a clearly defined setting with a specific topic. Or coffee breaks at work where you just have to make conversations for like 10 minutes because I can come up with something for that duration. But meeting people privately? I‘m clueless and don‘t like feeling like I have to entertain anyone. It basically works because my partner is very social and does most of the topic finding and I can just chip in if I feel like I have something to say on that. 
I‘ve always had special interests. I read parts of a medical textbook at 11. at 15, I became obsessed with national politics (policy projects, processes etc.). More recently, I‘ve read a lot on my country‘s social security system. I‘ve also meticulously studied the tax declaration manual, which has earned me plenty of odd looks.
I strongly dislike crowds and noisy places in general. As a child, being taken to the mall was one of the worst things you could do to me. I preferred sitting in my room and drawing or reading. I still prefer being at home or in other quiet environments where I can concentrate on stuff.
I‘ve read that routines are important to sutistic people. This is not that much the case for me, although I‘m also not that spontaneous. For example, I want to know if we stay home or if we go out for dinner but as long as I can assume we will find a table somewhere, it‘s okay to spontaneously decide where exactly we go.
FInally, I‘m a very rational person. My partner has repeatedly pointed out that when asked about my feelings, I reply logically. On the other hand, I like watching telenovelas, which I know to be very unrealistic but still enjoy. I guess I just like the concept of „happily ever after“. 

Any thoughts on this? Does anyone have similar experiences having some traits but not others?

It started off with tachycardia just at night 3 or 4 times a week.  Then it started happening every night. Then every day, and then all day every day. We tried fludrocortisone, midodrine, metoprolol, sodium pills. It's def a good thing i can't, but I can't smoke anymore, or even have a sip of regular coffee or I am so screwed. If I take more than a light puff of a cigarette, I get bad tightness in my chest, heart races uncontrollably, hands go numb, extreme leg/arm pain, and my neck locks up. If I want coffee, it has to be decaf, and the cup must contain 2mg or less of caffeine or I get bad tachycardia. I am slowly becoming a recluse. My life is getting harder and harder. 

I also have chiari malformation, so whenever I finally get the ist in-check for the day, the chiari takes over and I have bradycardia instead of tachycardia. I assume that is what is causing the bradycardia anyway? I could be wrong? Because there is no reason my heart rate should drop so low. I'll sit down and my heart rate goes into the low 50s, sometimes even lower. I'm scared to go to bed some nights. The last time I took just a little less than half of a low dose metoprolol, I wound up in the er with chest pain and a hr of 43. I am losing my mind. I can only go for light walks. I would like to go jogging on a treadmill but if jog for more than 15 seconds, my heart rate skyrocket upward every time. I  also can't do any heavy lifting for more than 20 seconds. Bending down for something is sometimes a chore. If I want to lift light 8 pound weights, I have to be sitting down. All my exercises have to be sitting down or laying down. Anything done standing up and my heart goes faster and faster til it feels like it could give out and I get bad chest pain.

If anyone has any ideas, or personal experience with a fix that actually works, I am finally out of options. Please help me

I’m confused because my BF seems to be so in love with me, I’m sure he’s considering proposing. But am I ready for marriage? I know it’s going to hurt him if I end things or if he finds out.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious shoppers who want a visually colorless diamond
* Those prioritizing cut quality and overall appearance over technical color grades
* Buyers looking for the best value in white diamonds

# Who is this not for?

* Collectors or buyers insisting on only the highest color grades
* Those extremely sensitive to slight color differences
* Shoppers with unlimited budgets who prefer D-F colors

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Appears colorless in most settings
* Significant savings compared to D-F diamonds
* Versatile for various jewelry styles

Cons:

* Slight color may be visible in larger stones or certain cuts
* Not as rare or valuable as D-F diamonds

# Recommendations for Smart Buying:

1. Prioritize cut quality - an excellent cut can make a G color diamond look whiter
2. Consider round brilliant cuts, which hide color better than other shapes
3. Choose white metal settings (platinum, white gold) to enhance colorless appearance
4. Compare G diamonds to F and H to find the best value for your eye
5. For larger stones (2+ carats), consider moving up to F color if budget allows

# FAQ

Q: Can I see the difference between G and D-F colors?

A: In most cases, no. The difference is minimal and usually undetectable without specialized equipment.

Q: Are G color diamonds good for engagement rings?

A: Yes, they're an excellent choice, offering a colorless appearance at a better value than D-F diamonds.

Q: How does a G color look in yellow gold?

A: While G colors look best in white metals, they can still appear beautiful in yellow gold, especially with smaller stones.

Q: Is the price difference between G and H significant?

A: There's about a 15% price difference, but visually, they're very similar. H can offer even better value if you're not color-sensitive.

Remember, while color is important, cut quality has the biggest impact on a diamond's beauty. A well-cut G color diamond can outshine a poorly cut D color stone. Focus on overall appearance and value rather than just the color grade.

### Why Water is Essential for Your Skin

Our skin is the largest organ of our body, and like our other organs, it needs adequate hydration to function correctly. Here are some key reasons why drinking water is vital for your skin:

- **Boosts Elasticity:** Drinking enough water enhances the skin's elasticity, helping it to maintain its shape. When hydrated, your skin appears plumper and firmer.
- **Reduces Puffiness:** Proper hydration can minimize puffiness and swelling, especially around the eyes, giving you a fresh, youthful look.
- **Improves Complexion:** Sufficient water intake can lead to a more luminous complexion. A well-hydrated skin barrier reflects light better, making your skin appear radiant.
- **Flushes Toxins:** Drinking water aids in flushing out the toxins from your body. When your body is detoxified, it reflects on your skin, reducing breakouts and blemishes.
- **Prevents Dryness:** Dry skin can lead to irritation and flakiness. Hydrated skin, on the other hand, remains smooth and supple.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

The amount of water needed varies from person to person based on factors such as activity level, climate, and overall health. However, a commonly suggested guideline is:

- **Eight 8-ounce glasses:** This is known as the “8x8” rule and is easy to remember.
- **Adjust for Exercise:** If you’re exercising or sweating, increase your water intake before, during, and after workouts.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Thirst is a sign that your body needs water. Pay attention to it and drink according to your body's hydration needs.

### Effects of Dehydration on Your Skin

Neglecting your water intake can quickly lead to dehydration, which presents several negative effects on your skin:

- **Dull Appearance:** Without enough hydration, your skin can appear lifeless and lacking in vitality.
- **Increased Fine Lines:** Dehydrated skin may enhance the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, making you look older than your years.
- **Dry Patches:** Insufficient water can lead to flaking and rough patches, as your skin's barrier function becomes compromised.
- **Pore Clogging:** Dehydrated skin may produce excess oil to compensate for the lack of moisture, resulting in clogged pores and acne breakouts.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

To ensure your skin benefits from adequate hydration, consider these practical tips:

- **Start Your Day with Water:** Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning to kickstart your hydration.

- **Add Flavor:** If plain water isn’t appealing, infuse it with fruits like lemon, cucumber, or berries for a refreshing twist.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables high in water content, such as watermelon, cucumber, and oranges, into your diet.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or apps to remind you to take hydration breaks throughout the day.

Exploring the Connection Between Hydration and Weight Management
----------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for your overall health and well-being. But did you know that hydration plays a vital role in weight management? Drinking water can have a significant impact on how effectively your body sheds pounds and maintains a healthy weight. Let's dive into the fascinating connection between hydration and weight management.

### The Role of Water in Metabolism

Water is crucial for all metabolic processes. When you're well-hydrated, your metabolism functions optimally. This means your body can efficiently burn calories and utilize nutrients effectively. In contrast, even mild dehydration can slow down your metabolism, making weight loss more challenging.

### Water and Appetite Control

One of the most powerful effects of drinking water is its ability to help control your appetite. When you drink water before meals, it fills your stomach, which can lead you to eat less. This simple practice can help reduce calorie intake significantly. Research shows that people who drink about 16 ounces of water before meals consume fewer calories overall during the meal.

#### Understanding the Science Behind Appetite Control

Here's how it works:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Stomach Stretching:** Water takes up space in your stomach, signaling to your brain that you’re full.
- **Hydration Signals:** Sometimes, your body confuses thirst for hunger. Drinking water can help you differentiate between the two feelings.
- **Reduced Cravings:** A well-hydrated body often craves healthier foods rather than high-calorie, sugary snacks.

### Water as a Calorie-Free Beverage

Choosing water over sugary drinks is a game-changer when it comes to weight management. Soft drinks, fruit juices, and energy drinks can be loaded with calories and sugars. By opting for water instead, you cut out unnecessary calories, which can lead to a significant reduction in your daily calorie intake.

#### Caloric Comparison

Consider this:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- One can of soda can contain around 150 calories.
- A typical fruit juice might have around 120 calories per cup.
- Water: 0 calories.

By replacing just one sugary beverage with water each day, you could easily save hundreds of calories weekly, supporting your weight-loss efforts.

### Hydration and Physical Activity

Your level of hydration also affects how well you perform during exercise. Staying properly hydrated keeps your energy levels high and can enhance endurance. When you’re adequately hydrated, your body regulates temperature better and offers improved blood flow to your muscles. This means you'll likely work out harder and longer, burning more calories in the process.

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Always keep a reusable water bottle with you. This will remind you to sip consistently.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or apps to set reminders for when to drink water.
- **Infuse for Flavor:** If plain water isn’t appealing, add fruits or herbs like lemon, mint, or cucumber for added flavor.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Make it a habit to drink a glass of water before your meals.


The connection between hydration and weight management is clear. By prioritizing your water intake, you can boost your metabolism, control your appetite, and enhance your exercise performance. Make drinking water a part of your daily routine, and watch how it transforms your health and wellness. Remember, with each sip, you’re taking a step closer to achieving your weight management goals.

Me, (M, 24) is currently attracted to a girl I met at work in a BPO (F,23). How we met and how I viewed her at first was a little snowflake that couldn't handle taking in phone calls as a customer service rep, I can still remember her saying ""Ayoko na, di ko na kaya 'to, dapat nag <insert her job related to her taken course here> nalang ako!"" among other things. But then again this is the same snowflake that was assigned to me as a side barge because I was the more senior agents sa account. So I basically did my part naman on helping her out, and over time, medyo naging closer kami dahil dun, and over time I developed feelings sa kaniya because of it. And I was pretty comfortable to pursue her at first kasi she was joking about how single she is especially when I was eating with her and her friends during lunch breaks, and over time when she was able to be endorsed to production, when our schedules aligned we would have lunch together na kami lang, she would talk more about her problems sa fam niya, her bad experience with her EX, her diagnosis of being medically depressed and stuff. (Yes I know these are kinda red flags pero, I was willing to be there para lang meron siyang tatakbuhan ganun, Being there for her when she needs help)   
  
There was even a time nga that I asked her out and she was G for it but we couldn't schedule it correctly. Pero we're at the level of closeness where I just treat her sometimes, if you even call that close. I know some of you will call this out but since I'm the one always initiating convos and I'm also the one being left on delivered... I didn't really wanted to think about her not being interested because I thought it was normal, she's still repairing herself, ganun.

  
There was 1 fuck-up that I did though, was during Christmas. Kasi we still had pasok on that day eh, it was around 2am when I was messaging her kung nasaan ba siya and I inadvertently pissed her off because of me being concerned of her showing up that day. Good thing she was able to, but yeah, I fucked it up there.

I gave it some time, mga a day of no contact, just to give it a rest muna. Then I just apologized to her a day after and confirmed we're good. But then after that time, something changed in the nature of her posting on socmed. Had to re-check thru stalking her fb but yeah, suddenly suddenly she's posting about some guy, she's appreciating ""Emotional Intelligence"", a guy who proactively does things to make her, Meeting a guy, ""When you finally meet the guy you're looking for"",""What did I do to deserve this man?"" etc.  
  
Suddenly I'm going into panic overthinking mode, and I don't know what to do. My time with her is on a clock because she's been telling me that she's being pressured by her mom to go back home, because nagkakasakit na siya. Another thing is that ""...Wait is she talking about me and I don't know it"" delulu thoughts are kinda popping into my head kasi I'm sure that I am able to do the things that she's posting about. Some parts of me are saying to just accelerate the process to find out to get it over with, some other parts of me are just saying ""she's not interested, but I still want to confirm it myself"", some other parts are saying ""You're starting to be creepy ngl and you should stop"" and some other parts of me are thinking na... still be there for her REGARDLESS IF SHE'S INTERESTED OR NOT because it's the right thing to do, kasi kahit friendzoned lang, the word ""Friend"" is there.

At this point I don't really know, I'll try asking her out again, maybe. Our schedules are never meeting alignment at work and when I asked her out before, the days were not aligning and we couldnt get a schedule together. But this time I think I should be more definite, and upfront. Kahit simple coffee date since she's a regular at Mcdo for Vanilla large coffee.",2,1735507498.0,OffMyChestPH,4,1.0,False

Current attendees here. We founded a startup, and are looking to contract out the animation of a GIF (or a few) and possibly a banner (or a few) for our website, LinkedIn, etc.

We have some ideas in mind as to what we want - a rough storyboard - and some style references. The work would involve the (drawn or 3D) animation of an invention, the (drawn or 3D) animation of various weather conditions around said invention, and possibly the (drawn or 3D) swapping out of parts on the invention. 

We want to keep our investment local to our own uni ecosystem, so we would be super interested in hearing about and connecting with anyone who may be interested in doing work like this, be it current students or alumni. **Our current budget range is $250 to $500 CAD**, and we are bootstrapping at the moment. We would ultimately like to walk away with *part of* the following:

* an animated gif or gifset
* a drawn / 3D product animation
* banner / cover art (landscape)
* founder / team art \[?\] (this is out of scope for our current budget, but would still be interesting to learn more about)

*Any* advice, guidance, or networking related to this would be super duper kisses and hugs and coffee mugs appreciated. If you folks know someone great who would do this work at a higher cost, please also let us know about it - so that we may possibly return when our budget is higher. We ***do not*** plan for our current budget to cover all of the above, but we would like to start somewhere. We do not have a comprehensive cross-section of what pricing standards are for work like this, and do not want to go the Fiverr route atm. If your recommendation uses AI for anything more than ideation, please do not recommend it to us.

1hp6741,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1hp6741/devastated_emotions_out_of_whack/,"Devastated, emotions out of whack… ","I miscarried my first pregnancy at 7 weeks on Christmas eve and Christmas day in the presence of my entire family while out of town and it was horrible. Nobody knew I was pregnant other than my husband and my parents and I tried to keep it a secret and keep a smile on my face as to not taint the Christmas joy. I was in so much pain and so removed from my body.

My cousin is also pregnant with twins was 2 months ahead of me. It was so hard to pretend to be happy while everyone was feeling her bump and so excited for her. 
I am so freaking sad and my emotions are all over the place. I can’t stop crying even though I had accepted everything that happened. I am so numb and depressed. 

The kicker was also going to meet my friends’s new baby and seeing how happy they are and how much joy the baby brought. I literally couldn’t hold it and tried to be happy for them. It was torture. It felt like a knife in my gut. 

I am so scared that this is going to happen again that I almost just don’t want to try again because I am so traumatized by it all. I am so scared of it happening again. I don’t care how much people tell me it wasn’t my fault. I am convinced it was my fault for exercising, letting myself have 1 cup of coffee a day…etc. 

 I don’t want to be around people. I just want to be alone. My husband doesn’t understand.",3,1735507299.0,Miscarriage,2,1.0,False

1hp66x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MySummerCar/comments/1hp66x2/i_broke_the_island_sauna_and_it_is_perfect/,I broke the island sauna and it is perfect,"On my now ~120 day long Mortal playthrough I got the Gifu up to 100kph on the dirt road and had no chance to dodge cousin's Fiat. I took the jail time. Five days. I drank three pots of perfect coffee while waiting for the cops to pick me up, for the increased fatigue rate from caffeine overdosing. 

To pass time in jail I decided to see how many cigarettes it takes to trigger the nicotine addiction achievement. I had already smoked well over a hundred cigarettes on this save but that makes for about two per day which isn't going to add up faster than the stress rate. It took me 60 cigs to trigger the achievement. 

I left jail with a stress rate of 8+ stress every 45sec which is unplayable. My solution is to detox at the island which led me to this funny discovery: by filling the sauna furnace with about 20 pieces of wood and a whole bunch more in the fireplace inside the cottage, I immediately raised the temperature to 115 degrees! The furnace keeps topping itself off with the superfluous wood. I ran this for a whole in-game day, just bathing and running outside to drink to avoid dehydration. After saving the game the temperature at the back of the sauna is permanently at 110 degrees even without fire. Sitting there quickly drains stress and raises thirst... forever. It never gets cold, even after closing the game and loading the save.

Another great and less obscure discovery I've made is that the sauna furnace can instantly be used to grill pike without waiting for the firewood to turn to cinder. You can easily grill two fishes at the same time. The island rocks!",4,1735507286.0,MySummerCar,2,1.0,False

During the past few days (maybe a week or slightly more) I've been feeling kind of tired with occasional flu pains in my legs and arms, and I've occasionally felt weak. I've kept track of my body temperature (which only reached 37°C on one evening but has always been below that), blood pressure (almost normal, slightly low at times) and bpm (always between 60 and 80).

However as I said in the title I've been feeling my heart heavily pounding in my chest and its surroundings with very little times off: it sometimes went away (or maybe I stopped noticing it) but I can't tell in which contest this happened.

I've been quite tense and anxious (undiagnosed) lately so that could play a role(?), but I also suffered from endocarditis when I was young (13yo) caused by bacteria and I remember feeling in a similar way.

I do aerobic intensive sports but I haven't been training for about 2 weeks now (last time was several days before the heart thing started). I don't smoke, I hardly ever drink.

I regularly take valpinax (15-20 drops in a glass of water before bed) to help with IBS and insomnia and I've been taking ibuprofen (one 400mg tablet a day yesterday and today) which helped with flu pain and weakness.

Should I be concerned? Is it just the anxiety or should I pay a visit to a cardiologist? I did all my heart routine exams (ecg and ultrasound, blood tests and throat swab) a few months ago and everything was normal.

Thanks for your help, let me know if I should add information

I’m 33, 6’0”, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Fun fact: Maine has the deepest lake in New England, Sebago Lake, which plunges down to 316 feet. It’s the kind of place where hidden gems are just waiting to be discovered, much like me.

Now, onto me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you enjoy laid-back mornings. I’m all about lazy Sundays, relaxing, and making memories over shared experiences.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Consistency: I want someone who’s invested in making our connection strong every single day, no ghosting, no playing games. Consistent effort and genuine affection are non-negotiable for me. If you’re the type who stays engaged and interested, we’ll have something real and lasting.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m open to long-distance relationships and even the idea of living in another state or country someday, as long as we can visit each other and build our connection. I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark.

Hey everyone!

I wanted to share my little victory with you all. Before this semester, I was in deep trouble. I had fewer credits than required, and I needed to catch up this term or else face a penalty. On top of that, I had no actual skills and had joined a team where most of my assigned tasks were overdue. Basically, I had only 3 months to fix everything or my life would have gone downhill fast.

So I made a plan. I decided to clear everything out and, most importantly, study every day. It wasn't easy—there were days when I could barely get one thing done, and there were many nights I had to pull all-nighters (shoutout to coffee for being my true MVP). I even had some stormy nights where I cried and let my worst-case thoughts take over.

But despite all that, I kept pushing through. I gave it everything I had, like my life depended on it. And now, 3 months later, I'm beyond happy to share that:

1. I earned a significant number of credits(not enough to meet the target, but about 95% of the way there) and to my surprise I also topped in 2 courses. YAY!

2. I completed all the overdue assignments I was assigned (this was HUGE for me).

3. I made progress on the skills I lacked, even though I didn't fully finish the task—I'm about 40% done, which means I'm 40% better than I was when I started.

4. And most importantly, I'm WAY happier than before, and my family is too!

Also, this was the first time in my life where I myself took control of the situation by working towards the solution and to be honest it feels great to know that I am warrior and I am able to fight the situation which life threw at me. Now I am working on goals for next 3 months.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has supported me along the way. If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed like I was, trust me, it gets better. The key is to make a plan and stick to it. I could’ve easily gotten lost in my worries and done nothing, but instead, I focused on getting the work done, little by little. If I can do it, so can you.

Thank you all for the encouragement and love! Keep going, don’t give up on yourself. You’re capable of more than you think.

Mans was a menace, always chasing shit he shouldn’t, being fine with a trigger the one minute and then trying to bite it the next, could not be trusted to greet people without heavy management or he would try to nip their ankles and hump, loosing his shit at every dog he saw, ignoring food, constantly overstimulated.

Now hes 20 months old and its like a light switched, hes listening to me, even around the apartment building door i can now hold it open for people and so long as i ask him to sit behind me for the person to pass he (which was one of his biggest triggers) and with me i can now trust he wont try to nip their ankles or sleeves, most dogs now he will be a bit curious but counter conditioning has been working amazingly (biggest issue now is him reacting defensively); his loose leash walking 1:1 is great and walking with family its going great, i can completely trust him to not try and chase motorbikes or people passing by us and especially carts, bicycles, people running. 

Its like he’s a different dog lmfao. He isnt an easy dog but im at a point where im satisfied with how things are. Now i just need to make sure to travel with him every month as it seems to help him a lot for some reason; traveling with him has for some reason made a world of difference for his dog reactivity. Its so nice to be able to be on a walk and trust he wont throw me into traffic or chase after a shopping cart or runner or cyclist. I can stop by my fav coffee shop and the owner lets finn come inside and he settles so well while im talking with my friend; and at the talho he behaves amazingly to and the owners of the place love him

Polish Potatoes - I get oud first, then it dries down to a lovely warm hay scent. Maybe a hint of cooked potatoes and beets. Not as earthy/potato-forward as I had hoped, but it’s still really beautiful and way more understated and “wearable” than I thought it would be lol

Coffee White Flowers - bold bitter black coffee, the white florals slowly come into focus but they stay very much in the background. Smells like a coffee shop with a few bouquets around. Lovely, delightful! 

Wild Carrot Oud - freshly turned dirt, a hint of sweet carrot. Extremely earthy, very little of the sweetness I’d expect from a carrot scent. Still, I do love a good dirty petrichor and this delivers! 

Magic Mushrooms - this one seems highly conceptual to me, smells kind of like how doing mushrooms feels lol. Slightly grimey, but overwhelmingly fun and colorful. Has an effervescent quality, slightly umami, much sweeter smelling than I would have expected. Really interesting!!

Sometimes I'd go through phases without coffee, but then I'd always come back. Through it all, I was always a poor sleeper, pushing through most days as an exhausted man thinking this was somehow just my normal. I blamed it on stress, anxiety and poor sleep hygeine (i.e. screens too close to bedtime), etc. Never really thought one single cup of coffee around 9am would be the culprit. Then I started realizing that I was also a big fan of iced tea ever since I gave up soda. I also binged on chocolate more often than not. Still, I estimate that I never went above 200mg of caffeine most days. Though it should be noted that I'd have iced tea with dinner occasionally which would be much later in the day. Either way, I decided to finally cut out coffee and all caffeine to see what happened.

I'm caffeine free for 3 weeks now and in one of the more shocking things I've ever experienced in my life, I'm not only sleeping better, but I can now function almost fine on shorter nights of sleep, not experiencing brain fog for the entire day. The thing is though, I never realized that it was in fact brain fog. I just figured this is what someone feels like when they are sleep deprived/exhausted. So now I'm left wondering, if I had a caffeine sensitivity that was THIS extreme, what was actually happening all along? And by that I mean, scientifically speaking. Why was I experiencing brain fog day in and day out from just one single cup of coffee every morning. Why is it now that I've cut out coffee, even on days when I haven't gotten a ton of sleep (i'm still a work in progress), I simply feel just a bit tired and not completely shot with brain fog?

Sure, we all know it’s about “privacy” and “security,” but let’s get real—what does that look like? Here are 5 simple scenarios where a VPN can be your best friend:

1. **Using Public Wi-Fi:** Coffee shops, airports, hotels... Public Wi-Fi is super handy, but also a hacker’s playground. A VPN keeps your connection private so you can browse without worry.
2. **Accessing Blocked Content:** Want to watch that show that’s only available in another country? Or access a video your region blocks? A VPN makes it happen—problem solved!
3. **Finding Cheaper Deals:** Flight tickets and online shopping prices can change based on your location. Switch your virtual location with a VPN and score the best deals.
4. **Keeping Your Browsing Private:** Tired of ads stalking you based on what you just searched? A VPN hides your online activities, so you can browse in peace.
5. **Bypassing Censorship:** If a site or app is blocked in your area, a VPN can help you get around it. Stay connected to the world, no matter where you are.

Secyber VPN is here for all of this—free to use, supported by ads (no, we don’t touch your data!). It’s simple, safe, and gets the job done. How do you use your VPN? Let’s hear your stories in the comments!

1hp5oul,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hp5oul/code_chaos_and_finding_truth_a_journey_to_digital/,"Code, Chaos, and Finding Truth: A Journey to Digital Wasteland","Two months ago, I sat in my room staring at my resignation letter, knowing I was about to throw away a perfectly good backend developer career. Why? Because I finally understood something that would change everything: most of what we're taught about building tech products is beautiful, polished garbage – the kind that keeps you up at 3 AM, your mind screaming that something's fundamentally wrong.

**The Breaking Point**

You know that moment when you realize you've been living someone else's dream? There I was, surrounded by browser tabs full of entrepreneurship courses, market research guides, and growth hacking strategies. My desk looked like a shrine to startup culture – sticky notes with ""MVP"" and ""SCALE"" plastered everywhere. Man, I even had one of those ""HUSTLE"" posters. What a joke. Every night, I'd lie in bed with this sick feeling in my gut, my thoughts racing: ""This isn't us, man. We can't do this bs. It's not who we are.”

Here's what they want you to believe (and what kept me tossing and turning):

* You pick a profitable niche (that bores you to tears)
* You research your ""target audience"" (people you'd never want to have coffee with)
* You ""provide value"" (whatever that means)
* You ""scale"" (while your soul slowly dies)
* You ""succeed"" (but can't look at yourself in the mirror)

Each time I tried to follow these ""proven strategies,"" it felt like swallowing poison. My subconscious would revolt at night.

**The Moment Everything Changed**

One day, I just snapped. Threw all that conventional wisdom out the window. Because here's the truth: I don't want to build for people with fat wallets. I want to build for the misfits, the artists, the code poets. My people – the ones who live for software, electronic music, art, and design. Then came the real questions. When I stopped trying to be what I'm not, these started haunting me:

* What if the process matters more than the end goal?
* What if authenticity isn't just a buzzword?
* What if building something true is better than building something profitable?
* What if our daily frustrations are actually pointing to what we should create?

**Finding My Own Madness**

Then I stumbled upon Greg Isenberg's idea that everything we do is a product. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I stopped looking outward and started looking inward, into the chaos of my own mind. Because maybe, just maybe, the answers weren't in some mentor's PDF guide but in the things that kept me up at night.

**The Daily Grind's Hidden Gems**

Now I question everything I touch in my daily life. Every app that annoys me, every workflow that feels wrong, every tool that doesn't quite fit. These aren't just irritations – they're breadcrumbs leading to something real.

**What's Actually Working**

Here's what I've learned from my time in the wilderness:

* Trust your gut when something feels off
* Build for people you actually give a damn about
* Make the process as important as the product
* Let authenticity guide you before money
* Question the mundane – it's hiding gold

**The Road Ahead**

I'm working on something different now – a collection of weird, organic ways to find inspiration for tech projects. Not your usual ""validate your MVP"" bs, but real, raw methods that might help you find your own path through this maze.

Maybe you're like me – tired of the same old advice that feels hollow. If you've found your own twisted path through this entrepreneurial jungle, I'd love to hear about it. After all, we're all just trying to build something true in this digital wasteland.",4,1735506006.0,startups,1,0.83,False
1hp5of9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1hp5of9/charlotte_dating_an_introverts_journey_seeking/,"Charlotte Dating: An Introvert's Journey, Seeking Advice","I (30M) have given up on dating apps, It was a mental drain. I decided to try to just go out and try to meet more people organically and maybe I’ll meet someone along the way. I thought it be a good idea to meet women that share common hobbies/interest by just hanging out at places I like and doing things I enjoy. These include: 

1. Coffee Shop
2. Video game Stores
3. Plant Stores
4. Book Stores
5. Anime/manga Club
6. Running Club
7. Gym

I haven’t had much luck with this either but I’m still having a good time meeting new people. I just wish I could meet a potential romantic partner. I don’t really approach women directly, but I can hold a conversation. I'm too introverted at times. You can’t find love if you don’t try. I guess, I just have no idea what I’m doing out here.

Am I going about this the wrong way? How Are You All Meeting People Outside of Dating Apps?

1hp5nu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hp5nu2/whats_up_with_men_wanting_things_but_not_work_for/,What’s up with men wanting things but not work for them?,"This is a long rant so apologies ahead of time. After a divorce, I started dating again, I missed the companionship and wanted to see what’s out there these days. And so far, I have been disappointed more than anything. Mostly about this: men say they want things out of a relationship, but never work towards it. 

Man #1: wants kids, a wife, and a home. Okay that’s fair I can work with that. But he won’t give up smoking, won’t get a better job, stays up late every night playing games and doing random things, that causes him to sleep in very late, never texts first or texts back unless he needs something. Buddy you won’t be ready for a child until you know what it’s like to lose your sleep and freedom, and prioritise someone’s else health over your habits. I dated him for 5 months because I was okay with who he is, until he started talking about plans but showed no effort for them, it just seemed like I will be the one doing all the work to make them happen. 

Man #2: already has a kid, just wants a stable relationship where we can go on dates and just have fun. Okay I can work with that. But he shares a house with his ex (red flag I know) for housing and childcare purposes. The thing is, I believe that they are both mature enough to not have any feelings towards each other and they are strictly platonic. But every time we make a plan, it gets canceled due to his ex not being at home to watch the kid, something always comes up to keep him home with the kid. I have a kid too and I have a clear custody plan in place, so I know exactly what time is my good time for dating, and when I have my son will be time just for him. But the man would not understand that, he thinks I should be patient to sit around and wait for his life to be free enough for me, while he can’t even make a clear cut with his own life. I went on 1 date with him and texted for 5 weeks, lots of canceled plans and I decided to have some self respect to just end things. 

Man #3: no kids, has a place, has a good job, wants to just date. Sounds great, right? Well he can’t even make a plan to save his life. When we texted, he talked a good game about how the first date is going to be so magical with flowers and what not, but when it comes to actually making plans, he cannot set a date or time. Coffee on the weekend? No that’s too much driving just for coffee. Hike? Too much work. Like why are you even dating if you can’t be arsed enough to make plans? After 4 weeks of not meeting, I feel like he just wants someone to text to lol. I stopped texting him after 4 weeks. 

Mind you, all these men are over 30. You can see that I started to lose my patience and start to grow some self respect lol. I do want a relationship and show my effort to whoever I’m with, so long as they put in the same amount of energy, or at least a crumb of respect. But none so far has impressed me. I don’t think I’m asking for too much, just want to see someone who actually sticks to his words. Why keep a girl on the hook for maybes just so you feel better about yourself. So I think I’m off dating for a while, until someone actually wants to make an effort to have a real relationship. And frankly enough, I’m okay with not ever finding that person as well.

1hp5n9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1hp5n9q/scraped_by_and_finally_got_some_breathing_room/,Scraped by and finally got some breathing room this year,"I started this year barely hanging on. I was behind on rent, had $38 in my bank account, and no clue how I was going to make it to the next paycheck. I was so stressed all the time - like, physically sick from it.

I didn’t really have a plan. I just started doing whatever I could to keep my head above water. I called the utility company to get on a payment plan so they wouldn’t shut me off. I went to a food pantry (which honestly felt really embarrassing at first, but everyone there was so kind, and it helped so much). I picked up a second job, working nights, and yeah, it was exhausting, but I didn’t have a choice.

There was one week in February when I got a flat tire, and I sat in my car cursing at myself because I literally didn’t have $20 to spare to fix it. A coworker I barely knew offered to help me patch it up.

In March, my phone got shut off for two days because I forgot to pay the bill, and I remember sitting in the dark, scrolling through old pictures on it, trying to distract myself from panicking. I ended up finding a photo of me with a big, goofy grin from a few years ago, and it made me realize how long it had been since I felt like that person. I saved it as my lock screen to remind myself of what I was working toward.

For the first few months, it felt like nothing was getting better. One time, I spent $12 on a pack of laundry pods, and when I realized how much it had set me back, I had a mini meltdown in the detergent aisle. But I kept going.

By summer, I had saved up $500 in an emergency fund. I know that’s not a lot, but for me, it was HUGE. I finally felt like I had a tiny bit of breathing room. I even bought myself a $7 iced coffee one morning to celebrate, and it was the best thing I’d tasted all year.

A couple months ago, I paid off all my credit cards, and I splurged on a quality secondhand jacket from Goodwill because I needed something warmer. 

Now it’s the end of the year, and for the first time in forever, I’m not behind on a single bill. I’m still broke, I’m still working two jobs, but I’m not constantly terrified of what’s coming next.

If you’re in it right now, I get it. It sucks. It’s hard. But even the smallest steps help. You don’t have to figure it all out at once too. Just keep going.

This was my first machine and the entry to this expensive hobby haha .

The Dedica fails to extract proper notes from the coffee most of the time and i have to stick to darker roasts and the inconsistency in shots is just a sheer disappointment 

Im confused between getting a bean to cup or a machine+ grinder combo ( ive been eyeing a barista touch impress and a profitec Go)

I want something thats easy to dial in and gives consistent shots so that i dont have to keep worrying about spending too much time on adjusting the ratios and grind settings all the time everyday (plus tasty shot ofcourse since im tired of the bitter shots of the dedica due to the temperature differences all the time)

Would love everyone’s suggestions and recommendations here !

1hp5lri,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/1hp5lri/is_this_really_tmjd/,Is this really TMJD?,"TLDR: Last August, I began experiencing sudden vertigo, brain fog, and dizziness after brushing my teeth and drinking coffee. In a couple of weeks, symptoms worsened to include severe headaches, jaw and neck pain, dizziness, fatigue, swallowing difficulties, and nerve pain in my arms and legs. Despite extensive testing (MRIs, EMGs, blood work) and treatments (physiotherapy, vestibular rehab, TMJ therapy), no clear diagnosis has been made. Suspected TMJD and vestibular issues only partially explain my symptoms. After a year of relentless testing and being dismissed by doctors, I’m left with no answers and no clear path forward.

Any other cases like mine with almost same symptoms and sudden onset? 

·  **Initial Onset - August (Last Year)**

* Morning routine: after brushing my teeth, I experienced sudden vertigo, brain fog, inability to stand, and hypersensitivity to surroundings.
* Episode lasted 2–3 hours; ambulance confirmed vital signs were normal.

·  **Day 2**

* Same symptoms recurred immediately after brushing teeth and drinking coffee.

·  **Following Days**

* Developed persistent symptoms:
   * Headaches (temporal, (sub-) occipital, and neck region).
   * Jaw pain, eye pain, arm nerve pain, and nose pain.
   * Dizziness throughout the day, worsened by moving images on screens (TV, phone).
   * Difficulty swallowing and severe neck/cervical pain during talking or eating.
   * Night sweats (only in the neck area) during the first hour of sleep.
   * Extreme fatigue, difficulty eating due to muscle exhaustion, and persistent hand pain.

·  **September**

* **MRI (brain and cervical):** revealed a thoracic herniated disk and poor cervical posture, but doctors ruled these out as causes of symptoms.
* Began kinesiotherapy and physiotherapy: minor improvements in cervical symptoms.

·  **Neurological and Autoimmune Testing**

* Autoimmune disease testing: normal.
* **First EMG:** normal.
* Explored rare neuromuscular and autoimmune conditions: no abnormalities found.

·  **Two Months After Onset**

* New symptoms emerged:
   * Food began getting stuck in the throat.
   * Persistent ear fullness and pain.
* Tests for potential causes, including LPR, returned inconclusive results. Suspected LPR caused by NSAID use.
* Extreme fatigue persisted, often requiring bed rest.

·  **Five to Six Months After Onset**

* Developed leg pain and stiffness, leading to difficulty walking.
* **Second EMG:** normal.
* Continued severe dizziness, especially in malls or supermarkets, alleviated by lying down with eyes closed.
* **Vestibular Testing:** diagnosed with left nystagmus (partially compensated) and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).
* Started vestibular rehabilitation, which provided temporary relief for 1–2 months.

·  **One Year of Testing and Treatment**

* Underwent:
   * 3 MRIs, 3 EMGs, TMJ CT scan, and dozens of blood tests.
   * Dry needling, massage, laser therapy, and physiotherapy.
   * TMJ flat plane splint therapy, meditation, and other treatments.
* Symptoms persisted, with no definitive diagnosis.

·  **Suspected TMJD**

* Considering I wore braces for 3 years (2019-2022), TMJD was suspected due to:
   * Clicking in the ear, hyperacusis (my ear gets irritated when I hear sounds like a spoon hitting a cup), lateral pterygoid pain (7/10), and mild masseter pain (4/5).
   * General fatigue while chewing and persistent eye pain.
   * Ongoing mild cervical pain and dizziness in busy environments (""Supermarket Syndrome"").
* Dentist and orthodontist ruled out TMJD as the sole cause, leaving other symptoms unexplained. Same with my neuro.

·  **Currently:**

* Overwhelmed by persistent symptoms, inconclusive tests, and the inability to connect the dots.
* Struggling to find direction or clarity on the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.
* Being gaslighted by everyone, from doctors to family and friends

 

I feel lost in my symptoms and unable to manage the endless tests, doctor visits, and especially explanations as this is a cross-problem. I don’t know where to go from here, and I'm not 100% convinced this is an exclusively TMJ-related problem (or at least is TMJ ""THE"" problem to solve?).

When I was around 10, I was really obsessed with LPS YouTubers and would constantly watch them after school with some of my favourite Minecraft YouTubers like stampy cat. It was a huge secret of mine. I think back then I would feel so embarrassed if anyone found out my secret. I spent my birthday money on old lps back then and made my own videos using iMovie. This girl named Abby went to the same elementary school she was known as a trouble maker back then, and one day we hung out at my house. I don’t think I could forget, as silly as it sounds. She saw my lps but more specifically #675 the Dachshund lps if you’ve watched LPS popular you know. She grabbed my iPod and told me that she would send the iMovie videos to everyone at school if she didn’t give me that LPS and I was so afraid that she would that I gave in. During the time it was my prized position because of how popular that lps is and how long it took me to get it. It was stuck in my mind for years. 

Many years later, I’m back for winter break and I’m working a part time job at a small coffee shop rn. She’s my coworker, we didn’t talk at all, until today.

With only a couple of days to go before I hit the finish line, I thought it'd be interesting to review how it went.

First, a primer on the rules I set myself:

1. Anything that doesn't get consumed or worn down counts as stuff.

2. Replacements were permitted on a one-in/one-out basis as needed.

3. I was still free to buy stuff as gifts for other people, or to receive stuff as gifts from other people.

So: how did the year go?

I spent a small but noticeable amount on replacements for clothing in particular: three pairs of shoes (pretty much all of my shoes were badly worn by then, and were all replaced in response to a niggling foot injury which then cleared up), and three pairs of socks (which was one or two pairs fewer than the number I had to retire this year.) My nonstick frying pan gave up the ghost, and so I replaced it with an enamelled cast iron model. 

I continued to spend money on fancy consumables; I attended some very enjoyable whiskey tastings, and my coffee preferences continue to run to the expensive end of the spectrum. I didn't notice any major effect on my spending, which I'm not shocked by; my spending on stuff was already quite low, so dropping it to nil was never going to do much by itself.

What did I miss? Pretty much what I expected; band tees and vinyl from artists I like, and paperback books. I lost a very nice double-walled travel mug early in the year, but I actually haven't missed that, and didn't bother replacing it.

Was this some privileged bullshit? Yes, absolutely. I have no intention of claiming otherwise.

He’s been locked up for a year being tortured, got stuck with a demon he’s terrified of losing control of, comes out of the prison with an attack on what remains of his family, and has a new contract immediately. Can we give the man some room to breathe and come to terms with his new life? Even then, he flirts with Rook but is obviously ashamed about losing control of Spite and makes it clear he’s afraid to get close to someone because of it and the rest of the mess in his life. He doesn’t think he deserves something good. So when he finally starts to make peace with Spite, that’s when he goes for it with Rook (or Neve). Only after he’s started to accept himself and not be so worried about losing control and hurting someone. 

And it’s a casual dinner, a covert inclusion of intent which he firmly puts in Rook’s court. No pressure, he doesn’t ask for a relationship, he simply remembers Rook’s favorite drink and made dessert. Rook picks up on it and Lucanis says the dinner isn’t enough, to which Rook says it is, and Lucanis is enough. 

People say Lucanis gets so many fewer scenes but this isn’t true. Harding definitely gets the least, at least in my 4 playthroughs so far. Lucanis comes in, gets several missions and scenes out the gate, you flirt with him more times than is offered for the other 3 in your party at this point, then obviously takes a backseat until you recruit more, but same with the others. And as you recruit others, they obviously each have missions and scenes to get them on track bond wise, so obviously Lucanis has fewer things to do at that point. But Neve and Harding have just as few missions and scenes here too. Davrin, Taash, and Emmrich take precedence to get them established. Then you do Weisshaupt and everyone is back on track, Lucanis has stuff again along with everyone else. I think people just see the gap while engaging with the newer members and think he just doesn’t have content. I’ve seen the same issue in other games. 

And when you do commit to him, there isn’t a kiss scene. So? He’s still struggling with Spite somewhat and from his dialogue with you and others, is clearly inept at relationships considering you’d be his first one. He’s somewhat awkward with normal things all the time, especially with flirting and anything to do with a relationship. He even notes that Illario was trained to charm and flirt and talk to people while Lucanis was obviously given more fighting training and focus, so of course he doesn’t really know how to do it right. His lack of forwardness makes sense for his character. And so what if they don’t kiss then? Since when does romance have to be about pda or touching? 

IMO, he makes up for it in other ways. Remembering an offhand comment about your drink preference, cooking you food specifically, being the only one concerned for you at Weisshaupt, etc. his love language is acts of service. Just because someone has a different way of showing care instead of physical intimacy and flirting doesn’t mean they are wrong or otherwise inadequate. I mean he even goes out of his way to get the team gifts and helps Harding with her bad dreams long before Harding even tells us about dreaming or having nightmares, but Lucanis noticed and gave her something to help. He fixes coffee for Neve so she doesn’t drink garbage, he cooks fried things for Taash, he cooks secondary meals for Emmrich because he doesn’t eat meat, etc. Why would his romance suddenly be different in how he expresses his care? 

So I think people just expected his romance to go one way or be a specific way like other romances and just saw his way as inferior and wrong. Which is entirely inaccurate. 

Everyone else gets handsy or physical with their care but that was never Lucanis’s way so to try and want him be like the other romances completely misses the point. And he romances Neve the same way. 

On the topic of Neve, he is absolute trash at flirting and didn’t even seem to see it as flirting. I brought them with me a lot in my first playthrough and just saw it as friendship with Neve teasing and Lucanis being awkward about normal social interactions. I never once saw it as flirting until later when they got together but by that point it just felt like friends to lovers, and he doesn’t even act that serious about it, neither does Neve. It feels very much like they are simply being there for each other and try to give it a shot, but his dialogue with romanced Rook is way more vulnerable and meaningful if you know how to listen. 

I found his romance very fulfilling and is my favorite right now. I also romanced Davrin and Emmrich, which I found different problems with but that’s mostly because their love languages don’t speak to me as much. Emmrich has words of affirmation and Davrin has the one which name always escapes me but he is more physical/intimate in that he talks about sex, alludes to it, and Rook even cheers him up by the promise of having “fun” later. If you like these languages, then obviously you are going to be more connected to them. 

Lucanis’s romance isn’t lacking, it’s just not the romance for you. And I wish people would stop saying his romance is just wrong or not worthwhile. Just because it’s not your love language doesn’t make it any less valid. 

Meanwhile, Davrin and Emmrich were good to a point for me. Words and physical intimacy only get me so far. But for me, Lucanis is speaking my language and it’s fun to listen. ",0,1735504714.0,dragonage,18,0.42,False

He comes to get a hug when he wants one, grabs my boobs or butt when he wants sex, but when I want one or initiate there's no one there.\
He tells me about work and his day but I don't feel like sharing that anymore, I feel like a burden.\
I decided a while ago to just say yes to sex whenever he wants and that might change things and make me feel less sexually frustrated. It seemed better but then just abruptly stopped. 
He gets regular blowjobs, kids are taken care of- driven to and from wherever,  all meals are homemade, fresh daily homemade bread, house is pretty much tidy, the house is fully stocked, presents/bdays are all taken care of, there are always clean clothes/towels/sheets. I do everything without complaining with no day off, I thought it's best to just accept everything and it will be easier for me and it is but every now and then I realize how fucked up that sounds.\
I greet him and ask him how his day was, buy him his favorite pasteries when I'm out, make him coffee, put my hand on his thigh in the car for affection (it feels so fake for me though because he doesn't even react)  I compliment him. I just don't know what to do anymore to get anything in return.\
He says he loves me and that should be enough, if I want something I should tell him. I don't know if that's true and some men are just like that or I'm dumb to believe that.\
What am I missing? What is that little thing, that sign of affection that I am missing? That husbands want at the end of the day? I'm starting to feel like it might just be time to just move on.\
Editing to add that sex or lack of isn't the issue. I just want some recognition and affection. ",0,1735504714.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

Little back story - Been suffering with this since the first time I can remember it happening which is back in the 7th grade. It certainly has not gotten better as I grew older, in fact, I would argue that now in my mid 30’s, I am more hypersensitive to situations which would make me turn red. Like most of us, just thinking about it in almost any situation will make me go as red as a tomato. For me, it is also accompanied by sweaty palms. For example, last week I had to meet with my boss and when I left the meeting we shook hands and mine was like a wet rag. I could see him wipe his hand on his jeans so he obviously noticed it too. Just thinking about having to shake hands will make my palms clammy. My armpits will get sweaty too in situations like this and often show through my shirt. 

I’m wondering if anyone has seen any improvement with completely cutting out caffeine and alcohol? I’m certain I have an overactive sympathetic nervous system which plays a big part in these symptoms. I do drink a decent amount of coffee everyday (2-3 cups) especially when at work as I do long 11 hour shifts Mon - Fri. Sometimes I do notice my palms getting clammy just from sitting there after having maybe half a cup of coffee. I also usually have a few drinks on a Friday and Saturday night on my days off. I am seriously considering trying cutting both right out to see what improvements, if any, it may have on these symptoms. 

Any feedback/insight would be greatly appreciated!

Part 1,"Hello Snarkers, the Fourth Day of Snarkmas is giving to you the first part of Janny Nine Nails’ wedding. And…well. I was left speechless at one particular segment involving First Looks and…let’s just get to it. Oh! Also, I had miscounted on bridesmaids due to Jingle not jangling her way into town for the full week prior. She has since appeared and is now wearing a gigantic silk napkin as a bridesmaid dress, bringing the total number of Dancing ~~Princesses~~ Bridesmaids to 6.

After a montage of the venue, we begin at the get-ready room, where CinderJana gives her most professional intro and covering the schedule of the day. “THE BIG DAY” I mean, I get it. I wasn’t married in my twenties either, but I also didn’t make a 40 minute 2-part YouTube Vlog about it either. But back to the show. CinderJana, aka Janny Nine Nails, lists out things to look ~~out for~~  forward to seeing like hair and make-up, pictures and her First Look with the groom, then guests and weddings. Is she trying to launch her own Fundie lifestyle channel and become the Joanna Gaines of Nebraska? I really hope not. ANY-hoo, she’s not too stressed because everything else that can happen, kinda has. She’s not wrong because she is one toenail down and has not loved her dress or her fingernails. She feels good though.

Music takes over as she discusses her wedding day look with her makeup artiste, Josie Bates Balka. The videographer spins around showing the makeup application front and back. The video and music pause to let CinderJana ask if she should just get married with the golden undereye patches on. Josie comes back to press the eye patches on better as the video goes to check on the groom. Nebraskans abound as a couple of the Wiss-ters appear at the end of a very fancy locker room with cubbies for every groomsman. There’s also a pool table in their room but no one is playing pool, they’re passing around the Bunk Baby B-squad and a couple of other assorted munchkins. A mic’d up Prince Preaching gives his run-down into his morning and mood. He’s a bit nervous but thinks only his family can tell. He also says he and Janny Nine Nails shared a cup of coffee this morning, despite his not knowing how to make a latte and not being a coffee drinker in the last vlog. Does he like ~~books~~ coffee now because he likes ~~JereMaw~~ CInderJana and she likes ~~books~~ coffee?  It was relaxing and, yeah, he’s uh, enjoying the day. Oh shit, is she going to post his sermons? The groomsmen dance and their Wiss-ters laugh admiringly while holding small blonde children. Norman Rockwell, eat your heart out.

Back to the bride’s side of the venue. The video walks up behind CinderJana in a chair and then goes to J’Blessa $eeWorld, Matron of honor. Man, the fine print in that jewelry box sacrifice to make J’Blessa be nice must have been extensive. I wonder what else was in there? Does the bottom of the jewelry box have “ J’Blessa is also entitled CinderJana’s services pertaining to home remodeling, and babysitting while CinderJana also agrees to give J’Blessa exclusive rights to top bridesmaid and first offer as godmother of any subsequent children born to CinderJana in perpetuity.”? If so, she must have spent a lot of time listening in on Rimmy J’s negotiation with TLC. The montage and music continue as we see J17 in jeans holding a J’Grand, presumably Pastor GAS since he was already confirmed to be in his Doona. Next is Ofnostrils and OfPLanes, who is rocking the same hairstyle I did sophomore year as she sits on the floor with her Juggalette-In-Love to steam their non-descript grey satin napkins in dress form. Seriously, OfPlanes looks like she just shoved a bunch of mousse in it, then held it in a bunch with one hand and quickly shoved hairpins in with the other. I know, I used to do this when I had “7 day” perm that lasted 7 months before I just gave up and chopped it off. J19 helps a Duggalette put a bracelet on as Jingle slaps on a couple of the gold eye-mask patches. OfPlanes has a set applied also as the next shot centers on a fruit tray and Chick-Fil-A nuggets that have been delivered to both rooms. We jump back into the groom’s room to see that now that the Wiss-ters have taken their children out of the room, they are playing pool and talking and eating.

Back with the bridesmaids, no wait, bridesmatrons, OfPlanes is having foundation dotted all over her face. J16 and OfPlanes are now getting blended and J’Blessa jumpscares the world with a quick shot of her holding her hair around a curling iron and laughing with her face scrunched up baring her teeth. CinderJana sits getting her makeup blended in as she has a heart to heart with her top bridesmatron. Their conversation centers around the missing toenail, the lack of stress today, shoes and the fact that at least she will be married by the end of the day.  Back to a makeup montage and at least CinderJana likes this part of the wedding prep. She walks over to the other side of the room where she squeals at the rescue seamstress, thanks her, and then spends far too long yammering about the iron.

 

In the men’s area it’s time for Prince Preaching to be Prince of Pomade. He likes to work it in to get it real close to the scalp and then comb it. He doesn’t say whether he’s a Dapper Dan man or not though. He goes on to say that Janny Nine Nails laid down the law and told him to not cut his own hair. He saw a barber and now he’s here. His brother is mystified that Prince Preaching has cut his own hair since turning 18 and says it must be because he didn’t care.

Meech shows up while CInderJana is getting her hair curled and asks about the toe. Le sigh. Let’s break this down, shall we? CinderJana’s she shed apartment is across the driveway from TTH. We know that CinderJana and Meech saw each other at the rehearsal the night before and we know that CinderJana had Prince Preaching in her apartment, sans chaperone, ***before*** she had her coffee. Where the fuck was Perm? Where was this broad at that she couldn’t go check on her injured daughter the day before the wedding? Watching her other kids? They’ve been at the venue for hours already, they drove themselves. We’ve seen the Duggalettes leave the children who aren’t on the tit with the headships, especially at weddings so it’s probably not the J’grands either. Anyways. CinderJana gives a final lieutenant’s report to Perm, stating that it could have been infected from the pedicure before Prince Preaching’s dance practice moves took the toenail out. CinderJana states that she thinks she put her foot under his and that’s what actually happened. Sure, Jan…a. But she thinks it can only go up from here and Perm says they are praying that’s the case. CinderJana hops over as Perm turns around in the most non-descript neutral tone to ever exist. Seriously, it was a whole discussion. We couldn’t agree on a color term, so here goes. Perm’s satin covered lace dress looks like she stole my granny’s living room lace sheers (interior lace curtains) and let them sit in lint water before making them into a dress. Oh, and her hair is flat. She must have been desperately looking for someone to touch up that perm and didn’t have time. Perm thwaps on too much mascara, creating God-honoring spider lashes as she exclaims they’ve prayed and prayed and waited for this day. Remember when Janny Nine Nails said nothing else could go wrong? Perm is trying to put that to the test with a couple of last minute ego shots. Perm’s orange makeup makes the lintwater hue of her dress even more non-descript as she flounces out CinderJana’s skirt after helping her dress. CinderJana poses and Perm leaves telling her “see you in a few hours”. We watch Pastor Preaching get ready and I’m 95% positive he either put on Axe or had a decanter of a cologne. Back to CinderJana, all dressed and ready and waiting to do her First Look. A door opens and in walks…RIM JOB? Did he just spoil the First Look? Nope. Rimmy J stands with his back turned as CinderJana walks up behind him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Did she even bother to google this? That’s not how First Looks work. The father of the bride isn’t supposed to have anything to do with this whole part. Anyways, it’s his usual cringey blessing, and as if Perm screeching “finally!” wasn’t enough, it’s Sperm taking the credit for this happy miracle. He specifically prayed for “this to happen at the beginning of the year”.  Well, just so long as she knows who to really thank, and it ain’t God. CinderJana explains she’s now going to do a First Look and she means to say “another First Look”. Maybe she’s misunderstanding the whole thing?  Now, she does a First Look with her bridesmatrons (let’s be honest, J16 and J18 are so close to the marriage market that they count). For their part, the collection of Duggalettes are wearing a shade that they’d call champagne and I’d call opaque clear. It’s like the absence of pigment in these…they just look like they bought giant napkins to drape over themselves. They giggle as they wait and CinderJana hopes they are all praying for her.  They open their eyes and exclamations abound. I don’t think she knows what a First Look is.

We quickly get rushed over to the groom’s locker room where they pose around the pool table and take various group photos before going back to CInderJana’s room where her bridesmatrons group around her and laugh and fawn before taking the usual conga-line esque pose group photo. We are following a groomsman to the ceremony location. He seems to be rushing, presumably to ask Prince Preaching to wait until CinderJana does her third First Look with him. Oh, wait. It’s a prank. Too bad the photog is a pro and has told Prince Preaching when she will give him the signal CinderJana is on her way. Now onto the only First Look she should have had, Prince Preaching. She shares all 90 seconds of the footage and my God, keep something to yourself. Now. RimJob reappears and CinderJana forgot to give him a momento at “their” First Look. Okay, she’s just the Fundie bride version of Oprah, handing out First Looks like they’re blenders or cars. They have another cringey, forced chuckle convo and we mercifully get switched to the couple of the day, chuckling and holding hands in the bride’s get ready room. Rimmy J runs over with Listerine Breath Strips and passes them out like he’s at an alternate universe 70’s concert. Turns out they go right up into their noses acting like a non-habit forming popper. CinderJana and her Prince Preaching side hug to pray before going to their places. On the way, they stop for more pictures. It appears every young niece is a bridesmaid, dressed in white. Rimmy J reappears and gives his third bland ass blessing of the hour. He hands CinderJana a bouquet of white roses. With a final kiss to the forehead, the teaser scene for Part 2. Instead of cropping it with doors shut, she includes her first steps down the aisle. Did she just not learn how to do a cliffhanger?

Anywho, there it is. I will have Part 3 when she releases Part 2 and there will be another installment of Snarkmas today. Have a great day, everyone!",2,1735504600.0,SnarkyRecapsBySwiss,0,1.0,False

1hp55ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1hp55ol/angry_diet_plan_tells_exactly_what_to_eat/,Angry Diet Plan - Tells Exactly What to Eat,"(51M) Back before Covid I had my diet totally dialed in. I was lean and looked great. Throughout Covid I just let my diet go and ate whatever I wanted and I gained 25 lbs.

For years I tried different diets and eating styles to lose weight. I thought I was being serious at multiple stages but I just wasn't as serious as I thought I was.

Because reasons, my wife and I decided to separate this past June. I was angry that I'd let myself gain weight and I told myself I didn't want to be dating at this weight. My anger gave me more determination than any of my previous attempts. Sometimes it feels good to be angry.

I like to eat - a lot. Everyone who knows me knows that. I like to have big meals and I don't like small portions. Fuck small portions! However, for whatever reason, I'm 100% fine just eating 2 meals per day. Lunch is just a waste of time and effort.

With anger as my motivation, here's the diet I used to lose 25 lbs in about 5 months. I look fantastic. If you don't believe me, DM me and I'll send photos. I'm 6'3"". I was 210 lbs; now I'm 185 lbs. I feel like I can keep this diet, with obvious occasional exceptions, for the rest of my life.

Just for reference, I walk briskly 4x per week for 45 minutes and lift weights twice a week.

Like many people I have a few pounds to lose post-Christmas but I'm back on my plan again.

BREAKFAST (eggs & oatmeal)

Eggs: 7 eggs (scrambled or fried) with a small amount of olive oil, salt, and a very generous helping of Za'atar spice powder sprinkled on top. Sometimes I'll only eat 5 eggs but also add some steak with the eggs. God damn I love eggs!

Oatmeal: 3/4 cup of rolled oats, 1 - 2 tbsp of chia seeds. Small to medium handful of walnuts. Big handful of fresh blueberries, 1 banana (cut up). I pour boiling water in the bowl with the oatmeal and chia, then I microwave that for 2 minutes and after, I add the fruit and nuts.

Coffee: Two large cups of coffee with a little half and half and a scoop of Allulose powder for sweetener. Allulose is by far the best sweetener health-wise, and you can buy it on Amazon.

DINNER (""gloop"")

Ok, this gloop tastes great (to me) but I'm not overly concerned about taste. I'm angry and I want to get lean and strong and I don't care about taste so much. It is quite tasty though. Don't knock it 'till you try it.

In a frying pan, I combine:

A little olive oil (don't put too much)  
Beans: either half a can of chick peas and half a can of black beans or a whole can of mixed beans  
A can of pre-cooked chicken chunks (pour out the water first)  
A can of sardines (pour out the oil first), (once every 3 - 4 days, don't include the sardines for a day or two because of a low chance of some toxins)  
Half a bag of: frozen spinach or frozen brussels sprouts or frozen mixed vegetables  
Kalamata olives (optional)  
Hot sauce (optional)

Other than water (or sugar-free sparkling water) I eat no other food whatsoever during the day. No alcohol except on special occasions. If I'm dying for a snack after dinner, I'll eat 1 - 2 bananas and some sugar-free peanut butter. Or, I eat some sugar-free Greek yogurt with Allulose powder sprinkled on it.  I try to avoid the snack most days if I can though.  
  
This diet is awesome because it provides plenty of protein, healthy carbs, and plenty of fiber. I have huge, powerful shits and I feel great all day.

1hp54be,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NoInitiative9533/comments/1hp54be/lucanis_romance_isnt_lacking_hes_just_speaking/,"Lucanis romance isn’t lacking, he’s just speaking another language and it might not be for you (SPOILERS)","Everyone likes to harp on the Lucanis romance but I found his very good, but I also have a thing for tragic characters. He’s been locked up for a year being tortured, got stuck with a demon he’s terrified of losing control of, comes out of the prison with an attack on what remains of his family, and has a new contract immediately. Can we give the man some room to breathe and come to terms with his new life? Even then, he flirts with Rook but is obviously ashamed about losing control of Spite and makes it clear he’s afraid to get close to someone because of it and the rest of the mess in his life. He doesn’t think he deserves something good. So when he finally starts to make peace with Spite, that’s when he goes for it with Rook (or Neve). Only after he’s started to accept himself and not be so worried about losing control and hurting someone. 

And it’s a casual dinner, a covert inclusion of intent which he firmly puts in Rook’s court. No pressure, he doesn’t ask for a relationship, he simply remembers Rook’s favorite drink and made dessert. Rook picks up on it and Lucanis says the dinner isn’t enough, to which Rook says it is, and Lucanis is enough. 

People say Lucanis gets so many fewer scenes but this isn’t true. Harding definitely gets the least, at least in my 4 playthroughs so far. Lucanis comes in, gets several missions and scenes out the gate, you flirt with him more times than is offered for the other 3 in your party at this point, then obviously takes a backseat until you recruit more, but same with the others. And as you recruit others, they obviously each have missions and scenes to get them on track bond wise, so obviously Lucanis has fewer things to do at that point. But Neve and Harding have just as few missions and scenes here too. Davrin, Taash, and Emmrich take precedence to get them established. Then you do Weisshaupt and everyone is back on track, Lucanis has stuff again along with everyone else. I think people just see the gap while engaging with the newer members and think he just doesn’t have content. I’ve seen the same issue in other games. 

And when you do commit to him, there isn’t a kiss scene. So? He’s still struggling with Spite somewhat and from his dialogue with you and others, is clearly inept at relationships considering you’d be his first one. He’s somewhat awkward with normal things all the time, especially with flirting and anything to do with a relationship. He even notes that Illario was trained to charm and flirt and talk to people while Lucanis was obviously given more fighting training and focus, so of course he doesn’t really know how to do it right. His lack of forwardness makes sense for his character. And so what if they don’t kiss then? Since when does romance have to be about pda or touching? 

IMO, he makes up for it in other ways. Remembering an offhand comment about your drink preference, cooking you food specifically, being the only one concerned for you at Weisshaupt, etc. his love language is acts of service. Just because someone has a different way of showing care instead of physical intimacy and flirting doesn’t mean they are wrong or otherwise inadequate. I mean he even goes out of his way to get the team gifts and helps Harding with her bad dreams long before Harding even tells us about dreaming or having nightmares, but Lucanis noticed and gave her something to help. He fixes coffee for Neve so she doesn’t drink garbage, he cooks fried things for Taash, he cooks secondary meals for Emmrich because he doesn’t eat meat, etc. Why would his romance suddenly be different in how he expresses his care? 

So I think people just expected his romance to go one way or be a specific way like other romances and just saw his way as inferior and wrong. Which is entirely inaccurate. 

Everyone else gets handsy or physical with their care but that was never Lucanis’s way so to try and want him be like the other romances completely misses the point. And he romances Neve the same way. 

On the topic of Neve, he is absolute trash at flirting and didn’t even seem to see it as flirting. I brought them with me a lot in my first playthrough and just saw it as friendship with Neve teasing and Lucanis being awkward about normal social interactions. I never once saw it as flirting until later when they got together but by that point it just felt like friends to lovers, and he doesn’t even act that serious about it, neither does Neve. It feels very much like they are simply being there for each other and try to give it a shot, but his dialogue with romanced Rook is way more vulnerable and meaningful if you know how to listen. 

I found his romance very fulfilling and is my favorite right now. I also romanced Davrin and Emmrich, which I found different problems with but that’s mostly because their love languages don’t speak to me as much. Emmrich has words of affirmation and Davrin has the one which name always escapes me but he is more physical/intimate in that he talks about sex, alludes to it, and Rook even cheers him up by the promise of having “fun” later. If you like these languages, then obviously you are going to be more connected to them. 

Lucanis’s romance isn’t lacking, it’s just not the romance for you. And I wish people would stop saying his romance is just wrong or not worthwhile. Just because it’s not your love language doesn’t make it any less valid. 

Meanwhile, Davrin and Emmrich were good to a point for me. Words and physical intimacy only get me so far. But for me, Lucanis is speaking my language and it’s fun to listen. ",1,1735504460.0,u_NoInitiative9533,0,1.0,False

To me it always was a both partners things, but now I’m realizing I can’t worry about my partners only advise them and just protect myself fully.

I had an appointment with my provider, and he prescribed me Descovy and DoxyPEP. My insurance rejected Descovy, so my provider now filled for Truvada, two weeks later.

Can I get your advice?

1. I’ve read Truvada contributes to osteopenia and reduced bone density. Are there any things I can do to counteract that side effect? My doctor told me yes to be on Descovy instead, but my insurance won’t cover.

2. Doxycycline has made me throw up in the past. I’m nervous to take it. Do you have a personal tips on how to take it and when? Do you take it if you give oral and swallow? Do you even take it or use prep and condoms only? They say to avoid dairy. I have coffee with creamer every morning. Is switching to like a dairy-free creamer enough? I also guess that means take in the evening if so have sex that day.

1hp4yen,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1hp4yen/prediction_miami_dolphins_vs_cleveland_browns/,Prediction: Miami Dolphins VS Cleveland Browns 2024-12-29 16,"Ah, the Miami Dolphins versus the Cleveland Browns, a matchup that promises all the excitement of a lukewarm cup of decaf coffee. The Dolphins, sitting at 7-8, are clinging to their playoff hopes like a cat to a curtain, while the Browns, at 3-12, are already planning their offseason golf outings. 

The Dolphins are favored by 3 points, which is about as surprising as finding out water is wet. Miami's offense is ranked 17th, which is like being the 17th best ice cream flavor—good, but not exactly Rocky Road. Meanwhile, the Browns' offense is ranked 32nd, which is basically the NFL equivalent of getting a participation trophy.

On the defensive side, the Dolphins are the stingy seventh-best, allowing just 312.9 yards per game. The Browns, however, are ranked 19th, which is about as effective as using a colander to carry water.

The Dolphins are priced at 1.57 on the moneyline, while the Browns are the underdog at 2.55. Given that underdogs win about 35% of the time in football, there's a glimmer of hope for Cleveland fans—though it's about as bright as a flashlight with dying batteries.

The over/under is set at 32.5 points, which suggests this game might be a defensive slugfest or, more likely, an offensive snooze fest. We're leaning towards the under, because expecting these offenses to light up the scoreboard is like expecting a sloth to win a 100-meter dash.

So, what's the best bet here? Take the Dolphins to cover the spread at -3.0. While the Browns have covered the spread twice at home this season, the Dolphins' defense should be enough to keep Cleveland's offense in check. And if you're feeling adventurous, maybe sprinkle a little on the under. After all, this game might just be the perfect cure for insomnia.",1,1735504003.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

When I started my journey with Zepbound nearly a year ago, I never imagined how much it would change not just my body, but my entire life. At one point, I assumed I was around 360 pounds, but honestly, it could’ve been higher—when you’re actively avoiding scales, mirrors, and anything that might reflect a hint of reality, the actual number is anyone’s guess! If denial were an Olympic sport, I’d have a gold medal on my mantel.

In December 2021, a PTSD re-triggering event forced me to confront trauma I had stuffed away for years. It was devastating—yet it sparked the turning point I desperately needed. Suddenly, I had no choice but to really look at my life, seek therapy, and address the very things I’d been trying to outrun (or outwork) for so long.

For the longest time, I poured myself into work as if I were competing on a reality show called *Who Can Work The Most?* On the surface, I was a successful insurance professional, but behind the scenes, I was unraveling faster than a ball of yarn at a cat convention (I know poor humor - its an occupational hazard of being over 40 and male). Things got especially bad when I stood up against unethical practices at work and faced relentless retaliation. My self-esteem took a nosedive, and I realized I had let my job steal my joy—something I wouldn’t recommend to anyone, unless “joy theft” is the new office hobby (hint: it shouldn’t be).

Looking back, I wish I had sought therapy sooner, particularly when things at work were at their worst. It might’ve saved me from thinking and agonizing about the fact that maybe I was wrong for standing up for ethics and accountability, but I knew that wasn't me and that while I had a very low opinion of myself, I could never reject ethics. Thankfully, societal views on mental health are changing. Therapy isn’t just for “other people”—it’s for anyone who wants a healthier mind and a better outlook on life.

Eventually, I made my grand escape from that toxic environment and found a new job with an employer that actually celebrates ethics. Imagine that—doing the right thing is (*gasp)* encouraged! They also remind me of my worth on a regular basis, which still feels a little weird, but I’m learning to accept compliments without asking, “Are you sure you meant me?” Baby steps.

Zepbound became a crucial part of my journey toward better mental and physical health. I’m now at 228 pounds, but more importantly, I’m stronger, more confident, and living with a renewed sense of purpose (and fewer questionable office potlucks). Through therapy and self-compassion, I’ve discovered the power of asking for help—whether that’s a professional counselor, a support group, or a friend who’s willing to listen without judgment.

If you’re feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or clueless about where to start, remember: it’s okay to take small steps. It’s okay to ask for help. And it’s not just okay—it’s necessary—to choose yourself and your well-being, especially when the office coffee is more bitter than your morning commute.

Thank you to this incredible community for all your support and cheerleading. Let’s keep breaking down stigmas, sharing the victories (and even the not-so-great moments), and reminding each other we all deserve a life filled with health, hope, and maybe a dash of humor, too",15,1735503971.0,Zepbound,2,0.95,False

I’m kind of kicking myself over a situation that happened last night haha hence the post.

At 27 years old, I only just start going out to bars. Never liked them but I grew tired of being home all day playing video games and watching films. So I’ve made an effort to do more stuff outside such as the gym, library, coffee shops and yes of course going out on weekends to bars and clubs. Have only done so these last few months. Point I’m getting as is, it’s still a new environment to me even if I have grown to like them and some have become comfort zone.

But I never in my life have hooked up or began dating a woman I’ve met in person. My whole dating life has been OLD. On top of that, I’ve never been a particularly attractive person. At least not enough to get attention. Even now I wouldn’t say I’m a looker. 

But the gym, on top of some cosmetic changes, has put in a better league than I was a year ago. 

 It’s happened to me a few times where I find myself talking to a woman at the club, whether an old class mate I knew, or a OLD match who approached me when she recognized me, or an older drunk lady clearly trying to get it on, but I end up cutting the conversation short cause I panic and don’t know what to say. 

I don’t have this issue much in calmer places. Several weeks ago I talked it up with a girl at the coffee shop and was able to hold a convo just fine. Thing is, that’s a chill place where talking about your career, hobbies, daily life activities, general convo is accepted.

At the club though people are hyped and getting tipsy/drunk. There’s a fun vibe one needs to possess. A vibe Im not used to having. Again, I’m more introvert by nature and even my demeanor it’s naturally being laid back…. Unless a good song is put at the club haha. 

Last night I’m kicking myself causes I was staring into space at the club, and it happens I was looking at this beautiful girl. She turns to me and I realize we’re eye fucking each other. But like bad. Borderline becoming a starting contest. We stared at each other for at least a good solid 10 seconds. I never shy away from eye contact but this time she truly was looking into soul and starting feeling anxious. And the rest of the night I caught her looking at me. When she went up to do some karaoke, she came back down, walked passed me and I high fived her and she really held on as long as she could haha.

But again, didn’t do anything. What I’m asking is, how do I built “club speak” skills ? What does it entail? What do you usually say? How does a hook up process usually go down? 

Sadly I’m one of those people that needs instructions on how to… well do anything really haha: ",1,1735503894.0,dating,5,0.6,False

1hp4uoh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hp4uoh,Need some help.,"I have a 5-gallon cycled tank with a betta that I've been maintaining for a couple of months now. I've been adding plants gradually; some are doing well while others are not. The red roots were thriving until I added a top light, which led to the development of brown algae.

I got a Nerite snail a few days ago, but as you can see from the lack of a lid on the tank, it managed to escape and has never been found again—no joke! After that, I began using Flourish Excel, being cautious with the dosing, and I’ve mostly been using it every other day.

I also made some homemade fertilizer with banana peels, ground coffee, and eggshells, which seemed to help a bit. However, after I stopped using it, the leaves appeared to get thinner and started to melt. Although I see new leaf growth, I'm wondering if it's normal for older leaves to melt. There are some anubias, swords, guppy grass, moss ball in the tank. Also some big plant on top of the tank seem not to do great. Most of them are just tucked in the wood, gravel, or tied with fish. This tank does not get great direct natural light. Window is on the opposite side of the room and orientation of the window does not supply great natural light. Just the light on top of it and some indoor light bulbs.

Additionally, there is a problem with biofilm. I understand that it's not harmful, but I remove it almost daily. I replace the water and filter it through a paper towel to catch the biofilm.

Dark tannin water is from Mopani wood, oak leaves, and Roiibus tea.

So I would appreciate it if you guys could help improve this tank with any suggestions adding/removing stuff. Scuze the glass stains. Also needs some suggestions on glass cleaners. Btw, I do have that Api Master Kit for parameters.",1,1735503730.0,PlantedTank,0,1.0,False

**Automated transmission from the Orsipian-X3 listening station;**  

At approximately 03:36 (*GMT*) on 20/06/2003 \[Local Sector Time\], three ships bearing unknown IFF signals breached local space, rousing \[Me\] up from my semi-hibernated state. Following their unauthorized entry, two subsequent radiation surges were detected, most likely indicating that at least two of the ships had suffered critical reactor failures upon arrival. 

As the current station watch \[I\] attempted to hail one of the unknown ships. After seven consecutive attempts to hail one of the intruders, the call was picked up by a \[Redacted\], whose uniform insignia—though partially obscured by the distinct yellow blood of the \[Redacted\] species—was identifiable as belonging to the ship’s Executive Admin Assistant. The following is the transcript of our communications. 

\---------\\ 

**Orsipian-X3**: Greetings. As per the decree of King XI Vlurant, yo— 

**\[Redacted\]**: Shut the klark up! Who are you? What are you? I can't see you, we need help. I need help right now—\[unintelligible noises\] \[banging on unknown objects\]. Is this working? Hey, are you there? We need help right klarking now! 

**Orsipian-X3**: Greetings. As per the decree of King XI Vlurant, you are currently trespassing on crown lands of the the Conglomerated Empire of Tratcki. As the local control station, I request that you identify yourself and return to your point of origin immediately. 

\---------/

Aforementioned communications had only lasted 23 seconds. Whilst on my second attempt at following protocol, the visual feed of the unknown ship cut out, and interruptive expletives were shouted, which have been deemed unnecessary for the report and have been left out. 

After informing the unknown vessel of their obligations under galactic law, the distinct sound of a ship's door maglocks giving way was heard. Succeeding this, untranscribable noises were recorded; sounds of explosions, similar to the standard issue arms of the \[Redacted\], and similarly incoherent speech, sharing similarities with that of the same species. were heard. 

Further hazarding potentially inaccurate calculations, the random noises may have been a group of \[Redacted\] emitting noises similar to purposeless growls rather than any coherent vocalization or galactic common thus rendering their attempt at communicating incomprehensible. Mentioned gunfire ceased 12 seconds later, giving way to unknown wet crunching noises and the priorly established growls. 

At 03:38 (*GMT*) \[I\] terminated the communications line due to the ship’s failure to acknowledge directives. Consequently, I painted their IFFs as hostile and classified the vessels as Zlato-1, Zlato-2, and Zlato-3, respectively. 

From limited observations, local sentients appear unaware of the stated events. Requesting further authorization regarding the use of primary sensors. The trajectories of the hostile ships suggest they are approaching Umbrian Iupater. Their approach, if uncontrolled, remains uncertain. 

At 09:55 (*GMT*), Zlato-2 had been nearing the orbit of the gas giant at a nearly stationary speed. However, Zlato-1 and Zlato-3 were caught in a gravity slingshot effect due to the planet's gravity well, causing their trajectories to intersect, resulting in a collision. Causing the ships to alter paths, leading the ships into a new heading. Calculation software predicts that the ships will collide with the third planet from the system's star, with seemingly no attempt from either ship to correct this trajectory. Currently unable to stop the assumed impact event, nor have hailing attempts to the vessels been successful. By 10:03 (*GMT*), the allocated emergency response power had been depleted, resulting in operations reverting to \[My\] hibernation and switching to passive sector monitoring. 

At 10:05 (*GMT*), this report now classified as \[0-114CK\] was prepared, updated, and sent. Operations resume as normal. Standing by for further directives.

***10:26 (GMT-7) 18/9/2003 Cheyenne Mountain AFB's Space Surveillance Operations Center*** 

**Radar Systems Technician Sergeant Olivia Brooks** 

The day had started like any other thursday. I had been running on autopilot since my alarm blared at 07:30, prompting a five-minute shower and a protein bar hastily washed down with stale coffee. It was almost routine by now, ever since I assumed my new position just a week ago. 

After transporting myself into the SOC, I quickly reacquainted myself with my terminal, a strange mix of pride and apprehension making the groggy morning slightly better. Memories of my previous station at Dyess crept into my mind—a place where there was nothing remotely interesting to do. Driving back and forth between Dallas and Dyess on endless open roads was sometimes amusing but mostly monotonous when you realised that it was your life now. Shaking off the thought, I scratched my head and refocused, inserting my CAC card into the terminal, entering my password, and adjusting to the radar's perspective on the screen. 

Something odd was bothering me though, the unusually quiet room. I turned around and noticed some radar personnel staring at their terminals while a few officers exchanged glances over their shoulders. Was I missing something? 

Turning back to my screen, I came face-to-face with an indescribable sensation of fear and disbelief. An object on a confirmed impact course with Earth was displayed on my radar. My heart raced as I instinctively glanced at the orbital tracking specialist beside me. He was focused intently on his terminal, typing away with an intensity that mirrored my growing dread. 

""Is it the Russians?"" I managed to ask before realising how stupid that question was, my voice barely above a whisper. The quiet tapping of keys abruptly stopped. He turned to face me, shook his head, and replied, ""It doesn’t seem to be, it wouldnt be this slow if it was."" He then proceeded to show me the esitmated time, pointing it out on his screen for me. I was taken aback by him dignifying such a question. I nodded and then turned back to my screen, as he did the same. The room’s unsettling stillness continuing to press down on me like a weight. 

I was at a loss for words, unable to process what to do. I directed my attention to the information on the tracked object, only to be met with an enormous readout: two hundred meters wide and a fucking kilometer long. Exactly two minutes had passed since we first spotted it, and the room was still as silent as a recruit caught without his rifle in basic. 

This being only my first week in the position I found myself lost on what to do. I—and likely everyone else—was waiting for Hartz, our space surveillance officer, to say something that would explain this away as just a fluke, a glitch in the system. Surely, he’d start cursing out the faulty radars or blame it on the sun’s rays interfering with our readings, any second now. Yet, Hartz was as silent as the rest of us. 

The double doors to the uneasy room blasted open, cutting through the thick air like a knife, reeling me out of my blank state and causing half of the room to notice and get up. They either saluted the CO or put on their covers to do so, alerting the rest of the staff to follow suit, even amidst their alarmed senses and disbelief. Our CO’s conditioning led to such autonomous movements from us. Almost as instantly as our salutes were given, 'At ease' was heard, making me nearly fall back into my chair. Vance Bennett, as he was, was a pissed off man, and at first, it looked like someone was about to get chewed out, he seemed furious to be called into the operations center. Yet all of that went away, as if he had caught malaria, when the Ops officer, urgently walked up, and gave him the breakdown of the shit we were in. 

""Sir, we’ve confirmed an object on an impact course with earth that will hit near the gulf of mexico in fifteen days,"" the Ops officer said, his voice steady but tight with tension. ""Radar declares its dimensions as one kilometer long and two hundred meters wide. We’ve run the numbers through our systems, and it doesn’t appear to be a fluke or an action by any nation, sir. It’s most likely a rogue asteroid."" 

He paused for a moment, then continued, ""The current prediction places the impact point directly between Florida and Cuba. The outcome will be catastrophic if it hits as projected. We're looking at potential flooding across the Florida shoreline."" 

Bennett’s eyes locked on the Ops officer for a split second, as if to confirm the severity of the situation. ""What are our intercept options?"" he barked at the officer, who must have felt the tiny impacts of Bennett’s spit. ""Sir, conventional missiles are out of the question. The size alone means we don’t have the capability to stop it with what’s currently available,"" the Ops officer replied. 

Bennett’s face hardened, Without missing a beat, he turned to one of the communications officers. ""Get the Florida National Guard on the line. I want them prepping for evacuation scenarios. Tell them it’s a drill for potential flooding if you must, but get them moving."" Following this the Communications Officer immediately sprang into action, promptly dialing out. 

""Sergeant Brooks,"" Bennett turned to me, his tone just as cold as before, ""Keep tracking. I want updates on the minute. If anything changes, you let me know."" I nodded quickly. ""Understood, sir."" Turning back to my terminal, I trained my eyes back on to the bright screen checking and double checking to see if the object had any changes to its trajectory or if the tracking software came up with an alternate scenario, to seemingly no success. 

Bennett, meanwhile, was already barking orders to the Ops officer. ""Get me the Chiefs of Staff. We need contingency plans on my desk yesterday. If escalation is the only way, I want to know what the hell we’re going to be escalating with."" The Ops officer and other techs rushed to their terminals, either scanning the data or following the myriad of orders I was too unfocused to hear him bark out. 

After a brief pause, Bennett’s voice cut through the room again, more stable than before. ""I trust that the sudden shock hasn’t rendered all of you impotent. Nevertheless, I’ll make this clear, even if you have family or contacts in Florida, you are not allowed to discuss or inform them about anything that just transpired here. Neither the President nor the already overburdened logistics teams can afford that kind of panic. God forbid the half-standing National Guard, most of them have already been mothballed or rotated elsewhere.""         

Everyone knew exactly what he meant, even if some were more or less affected than others. We were on the verge of something potentially catastrophic, and the last thing anyone needed was people bogging down highways and jamming every other road in the state. 

I sat warily at my station, meticulously working with the software for any additional information it could provide. The rest of the room followed suit, everyone absorbed in their tasks and orders. The tension was palpable just as it had been before Bennett walked in. Nobody knew what might happen in two weeks, but the weight of uncertainty seemed to darken all the tones of colors for everyone that had been in the operations center.

***05:06 (FRT) 10.6.N301 Outter rims Listening Hub, Orsipian Arm.*** 

**Orsipian Sector Overwatch Director Kituth Va'ons** 

What I had in my hands would have been nothing out of the ordinary, considering breaches in our empire's crownlands or unknown vessels jumping into observed sectors had become something of a fad during our current queen's rule. She lacked the poise to secure the so-called 'protected sectors' of our once grand empire. I stopped myself, practically slapping my face as I realized the traitorous venom I had just spouted to myself without thinking. 

Waiting in this cramped room with the noisy air control units had started to get to me. Seeing the strained faces of other personnel around me I could feel the tension was shared with everyone in the room. A Laxton sitting next to me gave me a dumbfounded look, its faint purple hue making its reaction unmistakable. Considering I had just slapped myself, I couldn’t blame the weird look. Praising the late King Vulrant, I was grateful that only one person had noticed my short-lived breakdown. 

After what felt like ages, I straightened up as the secretary called my name, signaling it was finally my turn to meet with the Orsipian Operations Fleet Commander. His rank, at this point, amounted to little more than that of a planetside shore guard, thanks to the scrapping or redirection of our main forces, driven by certain bureaucratic decisions and the constant siphoning of our budget. Yet, he was the only person both important enough to do something about the current situation while being someone I could actually reach. 

I stepped into his office, waiting the extra second for his quirky door to fully open. 

The fair commander didn’t appear to be enjoying his morning, as evidenced by the scattered papers flung across the room—a telltale sign that the Imperial Bureau of Transcripts had once again conducted a surprise inspection. It certainly wasn’t going to be fun being the one to bring him even more bad news now. Finally, I opened my mouth and broke my salute as he gave me a certain look with his eyes that said, Get on with it. “Sir, you have to see this. There’s an extremely important situation brewing in the X3 sector,” I said, handing him the documents as his arm extended toward me. I continued, “Sir, we’ve been informed by our AI in the sector that three unidentified sh—”­ 

The sharp thwack of the fleet commander’s appendage holding the dossier hitting his desk stopped me mid-sentence. His face wore a distinct expression of I’m so done with this Faxel as he began to speak. “Do you even know how many patrol vessels I have left under my command? DO YOU?” 

I couldn’t immediately answer. The last I remembered, we had five Lekran-class destroyers and two Juvian E-class cruisers—seven ships in total, far below our maximum allowed force capacity of twenty-five ships, regardless of class or tonnage. “I think seven ships in total, sir,” I finally replied. 

The fleet commander performed a brief breathing exercise to calm himself before responding. “Well, as of two days ago, another listening post requested assistance, so I had to reassign three of our destroyers and a cruiser.” Hearing this, I was taken aback. The Colonial Strategic Management (**CSM**) knew we were already lacking ships, yet we were tasked with sending support to another system? This wasn’t right—even for the **CSM**. 

My thoughts were cut short as the commander interrupted my ship-wreck of thoughts. “I know what’s on your mind. I’ve been pestering myself with the same whys—right before those IBT pencil-pushers decided to bust down my door for a ‘paperwork accountability inspection.’” 

As soon as he paused, I jumped in. “Something isn’t right.” 

He must have anticipated my words because he comedically said the exact same thing at the same time. “Either something is going on with our neighboring sector, or...” He trailed off, visibly pondering his next words before changing his tone. “Well, either way, there’s no chance I’m approving a border patrol mission that leaves our port in the sector unguarded. You’re aware, of course, that standard protocol dictates formations of at least three ships for missions involving '*potential* military aggression.’” 

He practically spat the last words out, his voice laced with disdain. I couldn’t blame him—it was almost laughable how the Empire used vague terms like ""potential military aggression"" when our crown lands were being breached, and borders disregarded on a regular basis. 

Well, sir, if I had the chance to explain, this isn’t just a breach-and-go. The ships are potentially suffering some sort of malfunction, as detailed in the report. At least two of the three vessels are on a crash course with an inhabited planet of uncontacted sapients. If this happens, all our intel-gathering efforts—without revealing ourselves—will be in vain. The listening post only went operational a cycle ago. **CSM** will be reprimanded for such a loss, and they’ll label this a failure, cutting our funding even further."" 

The mention of funding being taken away had an immediate effect. The commander’s eyes widened, and his posture stiffened. Clearing his throat, he barked, “Klist’s sake, Director, why didn’t you lead with that?” 

Snatching up the dossier, he sat down with a motion reminiscent of a ship re-entering orbit, leading the chair to groan in protest. His fingers flew over the keyboard, no doubt drafting a message to **CSM** to request additional vessels and inform them of the current situation. 

After a while of typing, the commander picked up a scanner and attached the report to his message, digitalizing it. With a tiny thunk, he pressed a key, presumably hitting the send button before deflating slightly in his chair. Curiously, he began to read through the now-open file. Following his gaze, I noted to myself that he was either skimming or reading remarkably fast for a K'axian. Then again, it was foolish to think this one was an average K'axian, he was my superior, after all. 

A short moment later, he chuckled and said, “Well, this is odd. I assume you read it fully yourself, but the redaction of the species name is ridiculous, especially since the AI outright blurts their ‘distinct’ blood color and that silly phrase they commonly use: ‘Klark.’” He chuckled briefly, shaking his head. “They sure don’t know how to cuss.” 

Hearing that made me pause, thinking back to the details I’d skimmed over earlier. “Yes, sir,” I replied, “It seems like we might need to refine the software on our listening station AIs to prevent more issues like this. At least four other stations... well, at least the code revision can be made in-house, so there shouldn’t be any major funding requirements.” 

He shook his head in a manner that meant he was happy, which made me happy in turn. He stated, 'Perhaps if we fix such an error without the **CSM** being informed, we might get a pay rise.' I agreed—keeping this quiet and reaping the common rewards for a branch's success in helping strengthen the empire was a no-brainer. I replied to his non-question, 'Yes, sir, I will be letting the techies know to keep quiet.' He nodded, agreeing. 

After a few seconds, silence filled the room as I waited for the commander to say something, and he himself seemed to be waiting for the report to be sent through—or at least, I assumed so, based on how he had been looking at the screen of his data station. After a few more seconds, he must have felt frustrated, because he did the most expected thing from a K’axian and decided to hit his screen in a fashion I’d call 'not so gentle.' 

It was a curious sight to behold: both the commander’s reaction and the fact that the electronics were apparently giving him trouble. This was odd, considering they were supposed to be idiot-proof and extremely reliable. The empire wanted to mass-produce them but still considered the data stations sent out to outer-rim control personnel important enough to spend the extra money on the setups. Which I was very thankful for, The station crashing only because I had opened four applications at once was downright annoying and since my new 'promotion’s' prize was sitting at a desk for half a cycle. Having multi-pages for both work and entertainment open, even if technically not allowed, made the hours pass much quicker. 

After another audible tap, the commander looked satisfied with the results. 

I had almost dozed off in thought when he started humming, which made me turn my full attention back to him, his eyes visibly scanning the report again. “Do you have any idea why the species name was censored in the first place?” 

I thought for a second but came up short. “No clue, sir. It’s not like any unauthorized personnel gets to see these reports. The redaction seems pointless.” 

There was a brief pause as the commander appeared lost in thought. Taking the opportunity, I ventured a question. “Sir, I was curious about one thing.” 

He gestured for me to continue. 

“Why would ships probably belonging to the R’ho—” 

My question was abruptly cut short by the forceful impact of the office’s sliding doors colliding with the roof. Startled, I turned just in time to see someone in the final motion of forcefully sliding the door open. Three individuals in formal wear stepped through, their faces not readable. 

Before I could process what was happening, one of them began to speak, but their declaration was swiftly drowned out by the furious roar of the fleet commander. 

“What in the Queen’s name is going on?! I should have you all sh—” 

He never finished his sentence. One of the suited individuals raised a shock gun, firing without hesitation. Electric wires sprang to life, tethering the commander to the device, his body seizing in painful jerks. 

Instinctively, I tried to back away from the visible wires, but I only managed to stumble into the waiting arms of another suit. Their grip was iron-tight as they restrained me. The suit from before resumed his previously interrupted statement.""Imperial Intelligence Agency. Hand over any and all communicative devices on your persons and provide the 0-114CK folder immediately."" As the third suit moved to close the doors behind us, I pointed hesitantly at the file on the commander's desk. This prompted the free agent to stride over, snatch the file, and fold the writing tablet a few times before tucking it swiftly into her suit pocket. 

Meanwhile, the agent who had incapacitated the commander knelt beside him, carefully extracting the prongs of the stun gun with visible concern, and checking his heart rate. I couldn’t help but wonder if that was standard procedure, but I kept my thoughts to myself, as I had no desire to join the commander on the floor. 

The agent with the file spoke again, her voice uncaring. ""By CSMs orders both of you are to come with us"" Following this statement, our persons were searched, and a moment later we were escorted, or in the commander's case, carried into a waiting sub-orbital craft which then promptly took off, leading me to question whether I had really made the right call by accepting this so called 'promotion.'

1hp4tp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1hp4tp1/ukpf_would_this_be_of_interest_spreadsheet_tracker/,"Ukpf, would this be of interest? Spreadsheet tracker","Hi UKPF, long time lurker. I just wanted to gauge some interest in a tool.

I used to track my bank accounts and transactions using moneydashboard which is now shut. Even when MoneyDashboard was open i used to keep track of monthly spendings and  assets snd liabilities in a google sheet.

When Moneydashboard shut down, i ended up building a tool that uses open banking apis to fetch transactions from my banks and credit cards and track within my spreadsheet automatically. Its been really efficient way as previously i used to tally up the transactions in money dashboard and put it in my spreadsheet. Now it’s all done automatically i just need to categorise my transactions. 

Currently my software will go and fetch all transactions and balances and update my spreadsheet and then i have dashboards in my spreadsheet showing different views like monthly spendings on different categories and networth over the years etc.

The big benefit for me of spreadsheets are that i can build whatever i want based of this data vs using a 3rd party app because generally its what is built into the app unless they provide a export option even in that case its a manual process.

Would something like this interest folks? I think the product would probably have a small monthly fee just to keep it going and cover the costs. I need to look into it but something like 1.99-4.99 a month range depending on the costs ill occur. But want to get some feedback if this is actually worth building out further so others can also use. The idea for expanding this out actually came from a few friends over coffee recently as they are interested.

Feel free to discuss or question whatever in this topic as i want to get as much feedback possible st this stage.",0,1735503654.0,UKPersonalFinance,3,0.5,False

Picture Frames: I want 4 frames on top, but most I’ve found are too expensive. Any suggestions for budget-friendly options or where to buy them?
Airtight Canisters: I need airtight canisters for coffee beans and ground coffee, but the black ones I like are $35+ for a set of 2-3. Any cheaper alternatives?
Tray: I’m looking for a wooden or neutral-colored tray (may be I need 2) to hold the canisters and coffee grinder, but most are out of my budget. Does anyone know where I can find an affordable option?
Absorbent mat: thinking to place mat on top and on the open self to keep coffee machine and coffee mugs. Any suggestions/links for black ones or any advice what I can use instead ?

After one software project, I was left with a Surface Pro 3 (the lowest-end version with 4 GB of RAM), and I started using that for coffee shop work.

It's wonderful.

There's barely enough RAM to open three tabs on Edge. If I get lucky I can run Outlook or Teams (but not both) and still get something done.  Any Windows feature update requires me to uninstall almost all apps in order to gain enough hard drive space to succeed. And forget about code reviews...Visual Studio requires at least 16GB RAM.

But the form factor is great for me.

After another round of uninstalling apps, scavenging for hard drive space, then getting everything working again, I'm thinking about an upgrade.

But what to upgrade to? I wish there was a Surface Go 4 with 32 GB of RAM. Maybe I could get by with 8 GB. But the Surface Go 4 seems kinda old now, and is only available in business editions. Maybe Microsoft is phasing out 10"" models? Or if I wait maybe they'll offer a 10"" model with at least 16 GB or RAM?

I'm tired of the cycle I am currently in: impulsively buying makeup, then a moment of regret 'I shouldn't have bought that', then returning unopened items back to store. And then being distracted by another shiny thing.

I have sold or donated makeup that I didn't like the colour, finish, or performance, or broke me out. Which leads me to think I have sensitive skin 'cause more often that not I break out from new products, especially foundation and powders. You'd think I'll learn my lesson to think twice before purchasing but I still go out to buy more.

So to help keep myself accountable I want to post here, to commit to my Replacement Only Buy 2025 on makeup, skincare, perfumes, books. And a Low Buy on take away food and coffee (only allowed 1x/week).

I want to save for a goal that I have and I really need to be saving as much as I could spare. I have promised my partner not to be frivolous with my money.

My focus this year, makeup wise, will be to enjoy my collection by using it, practice my skills, and be content with what I have. 💖

* The Bianca is much larger than the Ascaso, which is problematic. I would need to place the water tank on the side
* In the store, they told me that the Lelit is made with cheaper internal components compared to the Ascaso and tends to have more frequent issues
* The problem with limescale primarily affects boilers
* I keep reading that the Ascaso is overpriced and should cost much less
* I don’t think I’ll use the flow control on the Bianca; I’ll already have enough trouble making good coffee, and the fewer variables, the better

A couple rifles, shot guns, and a few hand guns.  I  got a had no clue what what was in it.  All i knew was i had a safe, and  a shit load of  guns.  I needed a front until I get rid of some of these things. My plug was being stubborn at first like “I got to see if i can” whatever bro knowing dam well he could.  The safe had about $10,000 cash in it 1that I had to split 3-ways because I had co-defendants(if you ever break the law dont have co-defendants unless necessary because they will fuck you over, write statements, tell lies to make you look like your really not, and worst of all  try to fuck your girl).  So I got a room near by and pick-up some girl we go out to eat at red lobster, go see the new nightmare on elm street, go back to the room get high(my thing was coke and heroin), get weird(fuck), then goto sleep.  Check-out was at 11am i left about 8am left the girl at the room I dont know why I didnt pay for the room fuck I had the cash.  I left her because i was gonna break in to another house hit another 

 lick ( rob some one).  So I leave break in another house I have my co-defendants with me 2 guys im not gonna say there names because im not a fucking tattle tale.  FUCK the hotel is calling me numerous times I told them im on the way back to pay for another night I will pay extra just please let me make it.  When we got back to the hotel there was cops everywhere.  I panicked because i was high and told the driver fuck keep going.  I seen someone run out of the office pointing at our truck and talking to the cops next thing I know 2 squad cars are behind us.  This fucker pulled over like a law abing citizen.  I would of kept going at least run but I was riding bitch(the middle seat of a bench seat).  The cops got out,  guns drawn, yelling turn off the truck, get out hands with your hands up.  I was talking big shit tried to run got pepper sprayed, threw up, hand cuffed still talking shit.  Saying your a bitch in a badge, only a fucking pussy would pull a gun and pepper spray me. Just talking shit  but 2 cops had to carry me 1 on my left dragging me and 1 on my right dragging me throwing me in the back of a squad car.  I couldnt see hardly anything because of the mase, and vomit on my shirt banging my head on the window of the cop car trying to break it no action at all just knotted up my fore head.  We finally left and went to the city jail a real old timey place real shitty old school jail bars a hole in the ground for a restroom and a mat. My co-defendants where there obviously and that girl from the hotel.  I told my co1-defedants and that girl from the hotel dont co-opperate with the police, dont tell on yourself. I asked the girl what happened?  She said I dont know I was in the shower and cops came in the bathroom and told me get out and dry off and get dressed.  After A couple hours we got transferred to county jail.  All of us said that girl had nothing to do with it really anything she was just there getting high so they let her go.  We was at the county jail the jailer was asking my information I was like fuck you figure it out I was so uncooperative they put me in seg after searching me.  They threw some cloths in my room and told me to change so I took my clothes off and stayed butt ass naked baging on the door pushing the button everytime they would come on the intercom can I help you i would say help me please like something was wrong, when a guard would come and see whats wrong I would yell fuck off and shoot him the middle finger still butt ass naked.  They came and got my clothes pretty quick but they wouldnt come for anything else.  After a few hours they brought me a suicide vest I was argueing im not suicidal but they didnt care.  They gave me a suicide blanket I went to sleep.  I woke up for chow it was breakfast they gave me a cup of coffee and a tray of food.  So i drank and ate and pissed in the cup.  I was waiting by the door with the piss just waiting because when they open the is door im going to dash the officer in the face and try to run probably get restrained but fuck it.  Well my planned worked as soon as the cop opened up the door I dashed him in the face with piss pushed open the door and ran.  I didnt get very far before I got tased with the gun I fell instantly a swarm of guards came to surrounded me. Dragged me to medical put in a restraint chair with a spit guard for 12 hours they told me if i cooperate they will let me out after 12 hours.  So I did they let me out put me back in the same cell.  I ate dinner covered the window of the door with toilet paper.  They got the tray through the bean shoot this time.  They came by every 15 minutes to do a scan they would beat on the door telling me to take down the toilet paper down.  But fuck that im being really defiant.  After some hours they sent some trustys in to take it down.  As soon as they shut the door i put it right back up.  I did this multiple times finally they put me in general population.  I was in seg about 5 days. I was in general population like 3 days I got really cool with some white dude.  We made a plan to steal some commissary from some sex offender when lights go out.  So he stole the stuff when lights went out and split it with me .  When the  tank awoke  for breakfast the guy noticed his missing commissary. Made an announcement to tank that someone stole his comassarry when was asleep so be on the lookout. They was saying no one likes a jail house thief.  Some black dude pointed at him and I and said it was them. The whole tank was mad i mean everyone, The whole tank I think 46 people started surrounding us talking shit.  There was an officer in the tank so he called for backup.  They moved us to another tank I was in one he was across the hall.  I was in there a couple days there was a riot over a fucking sex offender between the blacks and the whites I got pepper sprayed again, handcuffed, and put in seg.  I was in there for a day then I was fucking with the sprinkler til it went off.  Water was up to my knees I got taken out hand cuffed again dragged to medical this time they put me in a bed with restraints they told me cooperate they would only give me 12 hours.  So i did they let me go after 12 hours back to the cell in seg.  I was good for like 3 days then I started fucking with the sprinkler again flooded my cell hand cuffed again and dragged to medical put back in the restraint bed for 12 hours.  They let me go back to my seg cell I cooperated did good for a couple days then set the sprinkler off again got hand cuffed went to medical restrained to the bed again for 12 hours.  I was good they let me free after 12 hours back to my cell in seg.  After about a week I went back to gen pop where I stayed out of the way on the spade and poker table gambling just doing time. After like 2 months I got a letter from that girl at the hotel saying that one of co-defendants text her at 3 am im assuming he was trying to fuck, a late night booty call but thats an assumption.  Both my co-defendants bonded out the first week left me in there didnt put any money on my books or visit fucking hoes.  That girl from the hotel would visit every 2 or 3 weeks, put $20 or $30 on my books, wrote me sent pics, even came to my court date.  Being super supportive my fucking family didnt even support me send me any money or write.  I was really surprised because they always seemed real worried when I was out asking me for money and stuff.  It might not sound like alot but it does mean alot to someone incarcerated.  I stayed in county jail for 5 months before I went to court date my court appointed attorney said the D.A. offered me 10 years regular probation or 3 years prison I was like fuck no.  I did ask my attorney do I have any charges or warrants any where else before i sign, she said no.  So I went back disappointed.  I went back a month later and signed, finally I was getting out.  I signed for 5 years regular probation but before i signed I asked my attorney multiple times if I have other charges or warrants in other counties she assured me I dont but something told me I did.  So I went back to my tank excited giving away my stuff packed all my stuff put it by the door where I waited several hours just for disappointment.  After 6 hours I relised I wasnt getting out.  I had to ask for my bunk back and my stuff I gave away.  The next day I got arraigned $100,000 bond waiting for transport.  I got transferred after 6 days I felt so betrayed and lied to by my attorney but couldnt do shit about it.  I finally got transfered I was so happy finally the next step I should of signed for the prison time I would have if I would have known the process.  After I got to the new county I got arraigned this time my bond was A $10,000 $1,000 to get out.  I got on the phone from the holding cells called my aunt and said You better bond me out for $1,000 I know im worth that  I will get a job and be in debt but please come on she said yes.  After like 6 hours the guards told me to roll it up i bonded out finally free.  I felt so relieved my aunt picked me up I could’nt stop hugging her and kissing her fore head I was so happy. My aunt took me to get chinese food I used her phone to call that girl from the hotel on messenger.  Gave her my aunts apartment address she showed up in a fucking benz.  I was like what are you doing because I know you cant afford this.  I  thought she was doing prostitution.  She told me that she was staying with some guy which I didnt care we wasnt together but he was doing some scandalous shit with the airport and the car rental place i dont didnt care and I wanted no part of it.  We got weird in the back seat I think I lasted like 4 minutes a long way from what i used to be at the hotel but fuck it I was so happy how could this day get any better.  She left I couldnt get high like I wanted so i had to just go to sleep so I drank wine with my aunt fuck I had to do something.  I got drunk and fell asleep.  I got a job at sonic to pay off my debt.  So I went to my great grandparents house because I dont have a mom or dad they both died when i was still a toddler or some shit growing up I had hell without them but what ever fuck it right it is what it is.  I stayed clean off drugs and out of trouble for like 2 months I went to court the first time my attorney told me 10 years prison no probation, I went to court 30 days later 8 years prison no probation, I went to court 30 days later 7 years no probation if you don't sign today and take this offer your going to have to goto trial which you will lose theirs more than enough evidence for you to lose there's statements the witnesses wrote and they caught you with the stuff so you will lose.  I was like show me the statements.  My hoe ass co-defendants wrote fucking statements on me told a bunch of shit that dont matter what a bunch of bitches.  They even wrote some shit about me that literally had nothing to do with the case.  My attorney told me 1 of my co-defendats got 1 year of probation the other got 3 years probation for cooperating i said they got probation why cant I?   The attorney told me they are not punishing you for your  crime they are punishing for that kid that died(my bestfriend overdosed a couple years back at my house)well his grandmother is the court reporter for this court.  I was like cant I get moved over to another court for a conflict of intrest?  He said no because shes not a judge, D.A., or a member of the jury so you dont qualify.  I said fuck it set it up for trial and left called my aunt asking what do I do please help she didnt know what to say or tell me because she has never been in this position.  I was like dam this is super fucked up I got to get high now.  So I went to get some heroin I made cheese and got drunk this is so fucked up.  I pleaded with my bestfriend who died dont do it goto the hospital but no because he will get kicked out of the military.  I tried to revive him but got foam all over my forearms pumping his chest, I even had to give the news to his mom.   It was his choice I didnt force him to do it I tried to convince him not to I still have flashbacks to that day even suicide attempts but whatever several suicide attempts. Now im getting punishment for some shit I really didnt do yea i defintly got to get high.  So I did called some attorney got some prices all over $5,000 theres only one way I know of to make that much money that quick breaking in houses.  So I started getting high again and breaking in houses to deal with reality of the situation, myself, and the flashbacks because I was truly in a fucked up situation.  So I do my thing a couple months my drug habit got really bad like $200 a day bad my dealer told me one time I was his best customer if it wasnt for me He wouldnt have the money to re-up several times.  So I was in this house one time It was almost empty but I found a gun I thought it was a fucking airsoft gun the back door was open some lady started yelling at me she had a broom running toward me  but the couch was in the way of the front door.  So I ran towards her she got out of the way hitting me with the broom when I got outside there was some guy on a lawnmower i guess trying to block me in.  I ran to my car and left I was only a few miles from my great grandparents house.  They had multiple cars like 5 I think my grandpa asked if I would help him with this bolt real quick he was working on a car I told him hold on let me get some water.  So I went inside to get some water and something  told me to get the fuck out of there.  So I changed keys and told him I cant help him right now I will when I get back and left hauling ass out of that county.  My grandma called me 10 minutes later saying what did you do because theres cops everywhere and where i was at?  I told her im around I didnt do anything and I will call her later.  I called my dealer or plug who was like 45 minutes away asked if I could come by of course he said yes.  I got high and told him what happened crying and asking if I could stay with him for a little while.  He said chill the fuck out I got you , you dont have to pay just get high and chill.   I have an apartment that I trap out sometimes you can serve people and stay there get high all you want and i got the rent just chill out.  So I stayed at the apartment like a month he showed me how to weigh heroin and bag up work in a walmart bag like little strips you can just tear off gave me a gun.  Told me that when heroin adicts get sick they can be violent because fuck their sick and will literally do anything for another hit.  1 morning I was really high on heroin, meth, and coke it was like 5am or something so walked to the doughnut shop.  I got stopped on the way there by a cop I thought I was a goner.  I didnt have any warrants yet so lucky but the cop said Your going to the drunk tank he wouldnt just let me go home.  So I went to the drunk tank it was super cold and i was wearing a tank top and basketball shorts.  I wrapped myself like a mummy with toilet paper and went to sleep.  Some guard said your free to go I left called my aunt she came to get me I stayed at her house a couple days after a couple days she was like lets goto this new club so I went.  When we got there we walked around a little bit stood in line waiting to get in.  I seen my co-defendant I was being super friendly with him we went in I told my aunt please let me borrow your car so she gave me her keys I went to her apartment grabbed some socks she had a light up mask from the rave club i took one of her shoe laces and a knife. Came back like nothing was wrong it was cold so I was wearing a hoodie.  When I got back i went in and left all that stuff in her car fuck I had a plan.  I had a wristband so I got right in I took her her keys and told her pick me up up the street when this place closes up dont ask no questions just please you cant tell anyone what you dont know.  So I made plans with my co-defendant to goto his house when this place closes we exchanged numbers fucking hoe.  I left her car unlocked about 30 minutes before closing time I went outside went to her car she had a pink hoodie in the backseat i changed in to, tied the shoe lace around my wrist tied the knife with the other end put, the mask on put on the socks on my hands. Went by his car waiting when the place closed and he came to his car I stabbed him mutiple times then ran some people tried to grab me I was like get the fuck off me and kept running I must of ran like 2 miles my aunt picked me up like I asked there  was an ambulance and cops there she said there was cops and and  an ambulance there, something must of happened you dont know anything right?  Fuck no!  We Went to some gas station and got like 50 cents worth of gas in a water bottle.  I called him like 3 times no answer though.  We went to some side street where i poured gas on the hoodie mask socks shoe lace and knife and burned them.  On the way to her apartment someone called saying my co-defendant was in the icu so we went to the hospital like what happened?  Apparently he got stabbed like 7 times hes gonna live though but he has to go in to surgery.  I told his mom it was probably over drugs or something i have no idea.  He was unconscious in icu.  If we can do anything to help let us know.  She called later that day saying  his lung was puncered and hes gonna have a shit bag but hes gonna be alright.  Some investigator called me with a bunch of questions I told him if you have enough evidence lock me up if not lose my number.  We had tickets to edc in Dallas so I ate some shrooms, smoked some weed, took some oxycontin, some ecstasy, and some bars.  I had a good night but I remember specifically I was on the swings on chains that go in a circle(I hope I am explaining right).  But i remember looking at people they where so fucking happy like I have never been that happy NEVER and I was about to goto prison.  We left to her apartment she lived in a townhome.  It was 4 am so I called that girl from the hotel no answer i think I called 2 more girls didnt have no action no answer finally 1 girl answered.  I got her to come over we got weird like immediately she started sucking me up and started fucking.  I was so fucked up I thought I was somewhere else I told her while we are fucking “hey pass me that oil filter wrench “ she was like what I said nevermind she laughed at me.  Then I said “this sheetrock needs to be changed” she was like what I said nevermind.  I said “that tire is going low” she was like what i said nevermind. I was hitting from it from the back i seen blood I was like what the fuck are you on your period your bleeding so we stopped she looked back and was like your bleeding from your nose.  So we was butt naked both in the kitchen cleaning my bloody ass nose with paper towels.  Totally killed the mood we tried but no it was dead for us both wasn't feeling it no more.  I was like you hungry I took her to a taqueria to get her some tacos I didnt get no food just a snow cone.  She left when we got 1back I went to sleep my cousin called me later that day saying something about a cookout so he picked me up we went to la michoacana to get some fajita meat then back to his apartment we started cooking I asked my aunt if she wanted to go she didn't.  When we got there his half brother was there, his half brothers son, my cousins girl.  We was out of liquor his half brother was like we need more alcohol so asked me to goto to the liquor store. My cousin was begging me dont go but I went anyway.  It was me, my cousins half brother, he took his fucking son with him we were drunk.  We got in the car right when we was pulling out of the apartments a cop just drives by this brilliant mother fucker put the car in reverse being all obvious and shit.  I was like what the fuck are you doing?  He said going back its a bad idea.  So we was going back to the apartment and got rolled by the cop. I was gonna run but he had a kid with him and I might not have warrants.  So the cop came to the window got our ids went back came to my side of the car pulled out the gun told me to get out.  Get on the ground  hands behind my back here comes the handcuffs in the back of the squad car I went to.  I asked why I'm going to jail. He only said I have 1 warrant but when I got to jail I had 5 warrants out of Kaufman county. Fuck, fuck, fuck whats going to happen to me I really fucked up this time.  This little bitch was crying over a state jail felony which is punishable with 6 months to 2 years state jail fucking vagine I figured I was facing a fuck load of time I thought. I got sent to kaufman county jail I stayed there like 8 months after 2 weeks I finally made trusty i was a kitchen trusty at first I fucking hated it so I quit put back in general population.  I really didnt like it there either some dude woke me up and the first thing he said “have you ever done k2?”  I mean I barely opened my eyes.  So I got up went to the corner with everyone(there was 8 people to a cell).  I hit the k2 stick 3 times I was really high I forgot I was in jail literally I was looking for my cell phone telling the person who slept underneath me fuck they are gonna get me the cops.  My celly laughed at me and was like “dude you should go to sleep”.  So I went to my top bunk and went to sleep. I was so paranoid from where I was I rubbed the tip of my nose raw red people was calling me reudolph for like a week or 2 well until it healed.  After 2 weeks i made trusty I was so happy at first they put me in kitchen I fucking hated it.  So after 2 weeks I threatened to quit again but they was plea bargaining no dont quit  i can move you. So they moved me to red suits a floor feeder I loved it i got to pass out trays,  give extra trays, and push the button and make up something they didn't really need and they would ask no question.   Just let me out it was like heaven or something  It was like freedom but locked up.  I put a up a calendar just because we was in a 4 man tank i noticed somebody was marking their days I was super fucked up about it so I waited until everybody was in there eating.  I got everybodys attention and said who the fucked up did this shit maked on my calender?  Some mexican said he did It i was out ragged so I threw his tray the fight began dude got the best of me I give him that but i'm not the type to hold a grudge if you win i would be like damn you got me and shake your hand. A week passes by the mexican and I was still arguing you could feel the tension we still had beef or a conflict.  Well one day passes and its just me and him in the cell he was asleep so I got on the phone with my gma theres a partition separating the shitter from the phone.  I was talking on the phone right next to me someone could be shitting while im talking to basically my mom, smelling shit.  He was courtesy flushing but that shit is still a loud smell you could imagine. I could only think one thing when *i* get of the phone im gonna whoop his ass.  So I got off the phone he got done shitting while he was washing his hands I was so mad i took a cheep shot to the back of his head it was wrong but I was mad .  So the fight begain he wrestled me in the shower no gay shit just fighting,  cought him with a right hook and hit him with a mean as left elbow fucking bitch his head hit the cinderblock wall.  I put my hands up to stop or surrender like ok lets stop you win whatever because he was bleeding really bad from that elbow like 3 towels covered in blood straight gushing we had to tell a co because you could see the white meat we thought he me might need stitches. But he didnt just got band-aid and a lose of job. I was fucked up because he was a good ass worker.  But he like a physco  ex girlfriend “the sky is green”  “um no its not” their goes the swinging.  Anyways it was like 2 months go bye and I finally caught chain to Texas Department Of Corrections(prison) I was so fucking happy a new scene.  They changed me out to all white and shackled me up and put me in a blue bird (the bus).  It was a good 4 hour drive basically on a school bus they were basically the same thing.  We got there there was a high ass fence with razor wire rows we got off start to walk in to some building with concrete floors it was cold as fuck december sometime we where at sissy ass gurney random people and my name got called “i asked where we are going the dude said “beto 1” that place is known for riots and stabbings like everyday.  I said there has to be a mistake.  The driver said no yall take medication you have to detox from and beto 1 is the only place with a built in hospital shut the fuck up with questions and get in the van.  In the van the driver said good luck somebody gets care flighted everyday here so watch your back because your friends will fuck you up the hardest.  That motherfucker didnt have to tell us that.  I got to my cell I was so happy because I was so tired they didnt even search us just took off our shackles.  I went sleep and woke up to the guy next door crying like little bitch like crying for his mom and like for real scared so I tried to calmed him down because in places like this its easy to get extorted or having to literally pay commissary to get beat up.

I got a nepresso vertuo pop and got the different coffee selection. However, I prefer ‘blonde roast’ coffee but I can’t seem to find the pod for this. I know there is a Starbucks version but it isn’t for the vertuo. 

Any help? 

Thanks. ☺️ ",2,1735502964.0,nespresso,7,1.0,False
