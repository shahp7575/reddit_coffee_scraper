And also So one more thing to add is my desire to dating does not come from a need to sexually entertain myself but rather get to know a person and experience sitting with soft gaze deep into her eyes, and asking useful questions, and later let things steer themselves mutually  
I am into 2 problems right now, not that I cannot attract women but I just don't know how to get the ball rolling  
I don't live my time in groups of people\[University societies, standing outside the gym, Sitting with the same 3 people in lectures,Clubbing \] I enjoy silent work and don't prefer validating 10 people in a day to waste time which I already have less of.  
How do you get to the point where u both know these might be serious territories without common mutual friend group kinda thing like and why do we need to validate so many people for dating someone which I don't have to  
If I randomly say a girl ""hey u're really cute would you like to come for coffee anytime"" I don't really care about humiliating myself if someone says no really I'd just say okay and walk away  
But the thing is either a person might get too confused or just jitter themselves with this level of directness  
and how do you really make sure the person is single  
Just too many questions  
basically I earlier thought that to date beautiful European women\[ u need to be very different and something which I am not capable of but lately I have seen so many beautiful women(in my subjective short term analysis) dating men way inferior looking than me which don't even cherish them as much I would do. but how the hell do they manage these women, I mean I think I'm cute and even get female attention(looks and aye contacts with cashiers, and bus stops somewhat make me think so sometimes)  
But don't really linger around in those circles to have access you get the point

I only want one objective how to get a first date, beautiful(I don't have supermodel standards)and honest someone I can talk to that's it",1,1750198174.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1le0bal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1le0bal/had_a_dream_reunion_with_people_i_met_in_other/,Had a dream reunion with people I met in other dreams — felt like soulmates from different lives,"So I had this dream last night. I was in this place that felt like a station or terminal — kind of industrial, gritty, and transient. I remember it being called a “junction.” The vibe was more impoverished — old clothes, small rooms, an industrial city kind of feel — but without any real sense of class divide. Everyone just kind of existed there.

Anyway, I was walking to get a coffee when this man stopped me — someone I had met years ago in another dream. As soon as I saw him, I got these vivid flashbacks of us spending time together in that past dream. We talked briefly and it felt so natural, like reuniting with someone I had deeply known in another life. Then we just said goodbye like old friends who knew we’d see each other again someday.

As I kept walking toward wherever I was headed (I honestly can’t remember the destination), I ran into another man I had also met in a different dream from years back. Same kind of feeling — not someone I recognized from real life, and not even someone who would typically be “my type,” but again it just felt like there was this strong, familiar soul connection.

What’s crazy is that even in the dream I knew I had met both of them before in other dreams — and yet it felt like the connection went beyond dreams or even this life. I didn’t feel sad or overwhelmed, just this really profound sense of “wow… how cool to see you here again.” It was like we were all living our own lives, somehow connected in this other space.

Also weird: I was super stressed out before bed and ended up listening to 741 Hz music (supposed to help with anxiety release). I swear it shifted me into a different kind of dream state — more lucid, more vivid, and somehow more open. I’m tempted to try it again tonight just to see if I can go back to that junction.

Anyone else ever have recurring dream “characters” that feel like soulmates or connections from another reality?

Alastrine took her seat at the meeting table next to Rosie. Husk had taken a seat at the very end of the Overlord table. The whole meeting Husk sat there watching Alastrine. In her perfect rose red suit and skirt with pinkish stripes sat forward exposing her tail. And just above it was a large black bow to match the one in her hair. Alastrine's skirt had small pieces taken out of it at the bottom as did her shirt, her black high heels gently taping on the floor as her leg bounce up and down. With her matching black gloves with red metal tips. Husk watched as Alastrine's shadow took her staff. Vox meanwhile was giving Husk dirty looks. Velvette seeing this just rolled her eyes in annoyance. Valentino at the time was playing around on his Hell phone. This was the first time in years all the Vees had been at a meeting together. Vox had only showed up because of the fact that Husk had shown interest in Alastrine. Vox usually kept himself locked in the t.v. room spying on all of Hell.

Carmilla took her seat at the head of the table. ""The first item on the agenda is the latest wars over turf, thanks to the latest Exorcise attacks.""

""Speak for yourself, I know for a fact that Rosie's, Alastrine and my areas are war free."" Velvette said, leaning forward in her chair.

""Velvette is correct our areas are very quiet. Even with all the attacks."" Alastrine said, in a matter of fact tone. ""I also know that Zestial's is just as quiet."" Alastrine said, her tail gently wagging. 'Yours is always under war because you focus too much time making your weapons.' Alastrine thought to herself while looking at the angelic gloves she was wearing.

Husk knew this was true, because he had been through the areas himself. It honestly impressed Husk, since his area actually had a lot of fighting. Husk felt eyes on him, it was Rosie. She was watching him watching Alastrine. Embarrassed Husk looked away his face getting warm. But Rosie kept watching him, till finally the meeting was over. When everyone was leaving Rosie and Husk were the last to leave.

""You know if you took a picture it would save you from the embarrassment. But it also wouldn't do much good, Alastrine has an odd power to glitz pictures."" Rosie said, starting to walk out of the room. ""If I were you I would hurry up and ask her out.""

""I don't know..."" But Husk was stopped by Rosie.

""Oh don't lie to me..."" Rosie said, with a smirk. ""I have noticed how you were looking at her. Just know that you should take it slow with her. And if you hurt her...well, I always wanted a fur coat."" Rosie said, showing Husk her razor sharp teeth.

""Um...I understand, but I really don't know if she'll even agree to a date."" Husk said, looking at Alastrine's now empty seat.

""Well you'll never know till you try..."" Rosie said, leaving the room.

Once Husk had gotten outside he looked around, but at first he didn't see Alastrine. Till a scream came from the alley way, then a tall lanky greenish purple eel-like sinner was thrown out of it. Husk watched as Alastrine soon followed her staff in her hand. Alastrine stood two feet away a shadow tentacle shot towards the sinner. It shoved itself down the sinner's throat and a green light flooded out of the sinner's body. Alastrine started to hum as the tentacle came out with a small ball of light. The light was absorbed by Alastrine's tentacle and the sinner's body got smaller. Till finally it was the size of a very small Chihuahua almost nothing left. But a black almost voodoo doll looking creature that looked up at Alastrine. It then got up and walked over to her. Husk watched as the small creature faded into the shadows. Husk made his way to Alastrine, he then noticed a small cut on her cheek.

Alastrine sensing Husk presents turned to look at him. Alastrine was prepared for the usual rush to judgment, she was used to it. The reactions were usually to run away or to try and join in the fight. But Husk surprised her by wiping away the blood on her cheek.

""How about we go out for some coffee..."" Husk said, looking Alastrine in the eyes as he licked the blood off his claw. ""We can take our time because I do want to get to know you better.""

Alastrine still in shock wasn't sure what to say. ""Alright...let's get some coffee.""

Alastrine was even more surprised when Husk offered her his arm. Alastrine took it, something about being on his arm felt right. Vox had offered his arm only once, but after that it never happened again. Alastrine thought for sure that this was going to be the first and last time. Alastrine's shadow followed not too far behind watching its master and Husk walk away.

Husk had taken her to an old fashioned little coffee house just down the street. Once there Husk had pulled out Alastrine's chair and waved down a server. The table and chairs were dark red oak, with cream colored table cloths with grey purplish knife-like edges.

""Yes, what can I get you today?"" The waiter asked.

""I'll have a black coffee with some sugar."" Husk said.

""The same, but minus the sugar."" Alastrine said, brushing back a piece of hair.

""Really?"" Husk asked, surprised.

""Yes...why?"" Alastrine said, straightening her back.

""I'm just surprised, I don't know too many women that drink black coffee. Most of the women I know like their coffee on the sweet side."" Husk said, a little defensively. 'Great...now I've pissed her off.' Husk thought to himself.

""I've never been a big fan of sweets, but I do enjoy the occasional dark chocolate."" Alastrine said, letting herself relax a little.

""So what happened...back there?"" Husk asked, pointing to the cut on Alastrine's cheek.

""Just the usual poor soul that wanted to make a name for himself."" Alastrine said, shifting in her chair.

Husk noticed Alastrine pulling on her skirt as if she was trying to hide something. Then it hit Husk, the sinner had tried to rape her. Husk thought back to when he came to Hell. A lot of people had tried to take advantage of him just for being a cat demon. But Alastrine was a deer demon a doe to be more accurate. Which meant Alastrine most likely got treated much worse. Husk felt a need to make Alastrine feel safe, to earn her trust. He had failed one partner when he was alive, but he was determined not to have it happen again. Husk had decided to change the subject they talked about their turfs. About where they used to live when they were alive.

""I haven't been to New Orleans since I was a kid. I had met a little girl there...I wonder what happened to her."" Husk said, sipping his coffee.

""How did you end up there?"" Alastrine asked, thinking about a boy she had met when she was a child.

""My parents were gamblers and they went there to try their luck. They didn't lose everything, but they also didn't hit the jackpot."" Husk said, with a forced laugh. ""If anything they kinda broke even...""

They decided to go on another date in in a couple of days. That night Alastrine was doing her usual broadcast and she couldn't stop thinking. Thinking about what happened after the meeting, about Husk, about the boy she had met when she was a child. Something about Husk reminded her of that boy.

""Stop it...that had been so long ago. And you only knew him for a few weeks before he and his parents left town."" Alastrine said, pulling out a necklace with a small white dice on it.",1,1750197750.0,radiohusk,0,1.0,False

now, referring to roommates. i have had many roommies over the years as i went to college and have moved few too many times. i acknowledge that we all have habits others don't particularly like, but i feel like i have had some rough experiences. in this case, i am not opposed to roommates as long as certain boundaries and expectations are agreed upon and met. so, if anybody has suggestions for places that has roommies, then that is ok and i may be interested. 

to anybody who is looking for someone to roommate with and pick a place with, here are my boundaries and expectations. with this, you can decide whether or not we match with similar ideas and if you reach out, then we could meet up for coffee or somewhere in public and go from there. :) some of my most positive roommate experiences have actually occured this exact way. 

boundaries/expectations: picking up after ourselves as well as keeping the communal areas clean-idgaf what you do with your room (or bathroom if it isn't shared). has to be ok with pets as i have a dog. i am also ok with other pets as i love animals. respect personal space. shared responsibilities. open and honest communication. agreeing upon guest policies.",1,1750197329.0,Reno,3,1.0,False

1le00x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/emirates/comments/1le00x2/my_first_time_in_emirates_a380_first_class/,My First Time in Emirates A380 First Class,"I just had one of the most surreal experiences of my life: flying First Class on the Emirates A380. I’m not a frequent luxury traveler. Most of my flights have been in economy, sometimes premium economy if I felt like treating myself. This journey, however, was something else entirely a moment suspended in time, one that I feel compelled to share for those who dream of this experience but haven’t yet made the leap.

Booking the Flight
Let me start at the beginning. I booked this using a mix of miles and cash. A bit of a splurge, yes, but one I had quietly saved for my version of a “bucket list experience.” I had read countless reviews, watched the YouTube vlogs, and seen the promotional photos. I thought I knew what to expect. I didn’t.

First Impressions: From Check-in to Boarding
The Emirates First Class experience begins long before you step foot on the plane. Check-in was fast and courteous at DXB (Dubai International). Staff treated me like I mattered not in a transactional sense, but in a warm, almost gracious way. The First Class Lounge in Concourse A? Imagine a luxury hotel lobby where everything is included: fine dining, private sleeping areas, showers, and even a direct boarding gate from within the lounge. It’s its own world.

When it was time to board, I walked directly from the lounge onto the upper deck of the A380. No crowds. No chaos. Just a feeling of calm anticipation and then awe.

The Suite Life
I stepped into what felt more like a private hotel suite than an airplane seat. Emirates’ First Class on the A380 isn’t just a seat it’s a fully enclosed private suite. Gold trim, ambient lighting, and a personal mini bar greeted me. A welcome tray with a leather bound menu, Bvlgari amenities, and pajamas was already waiting. The suite door slid closed silently. I couldn’t stop smiling.

Service & Emotions
What truly caught me off guard was how human the whole experience felt. The crew was impeccable, but not in a robotic, overly-polished way. They were intuitive, engaging, and kind. One flight attendant, sensing it was my first time, offered to give me a full “tour” of the suite and even arranged for an extra dessert “just because.” I found myself getting oddly emotional not because of the luxury, but because of the thoughtfulness.

Dining in the Sky
Dining was another level. Emirates offers “dine on demand,” so I ordered the seared tuna starter, followed by lamb biryani and sticky date pudding. Everything came with white tablecloth service, fine china, and silverware. You momentarily forget you’re at 40,000 feet.

The Dom Pérignon flowed freely, and I took slow sips as I watched the sun dip below the horizon through my window. There was a deep stillness in that moment almost spiritual.

Shower Spa: Yes, It’s Real
Let me say this loud for the people in the back: yes, you can take a real shower on the Emirates A380. And it’s glorious. The shower suite was pristine, lined with wood accents, marble countertops, and stocked with more Bvlgari products. The five minutes of hot water felt like a luxury retreat. I stepped out refreshed, wrapped in a plush towel and robe, feeling more like I was in a spa than on an airplane.

Sleep & Final Thoughts
After changing into my Emirates pajamas, a flight attendant made up my bed—yes, made it up, mattress pad and all. I slept for several hours, drifting off to stars projected on the suite ceiling. When I woke, breakfast was ready smoothie, croissants, coffee, and eggs to order.

Landing was bittersweet. I didn’t want it to end. As we touched down, I found myself reflecting on more than just the service or the amenities. This flight gave me something harder to quantify: a sense of stillness, of being seen, of treating yourself with intentionality.

Would I Do It Again?
Yes, in a heartbeat. Not because of the status or the spectacle but because it reminded me of what travel can be when we allow ourselves moments of joy, luxury, and presence.

To anyone out there wondering if it’s worth it whether with miles or money, on a milestone birthday or just because Emirates First Class on the A380 is more than a flight. It’s a memory you’ll carry long after your wheels touch down.

1ldzymo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ldzymo/my_husband_27m_no_longer_wants_me_34f_is_it/,My husband (27M) no longer wants me (34F). Is it impossible to save my marriage?,"Hi everyone. This is going to be long, and I’m sorry in advance. I really need a space to tell my story and maybe hear from people who’ve gone through something similar.

My husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 2. It started as a loving and supportive relationship. We both believed we were soulmates. Of course, we had our disagreements, but we always worked through them. I’m someone who values honesty and communication deeply. I never forced him to talk, but I always encouraged openness, and over time he began to open up. We tried to build something healthy, something lasting.

**Two years in, we decided to get married.** A week before our wedding, he had to travel abroad for work. We stayed in touch, messaging and calling daily. Everything felt fine. But the day he returned, I needed to use our printer and opened his computer. What happened next was a mistake on my part, and I fully admit that. I found myself checking his messages without thinking. I had never done anything like that before, and I still feel guilty for invading his privacy.

I saw a flirty conversation with a woman from his company. When I asked him about it, he admitted the messages were inappropriate but insisted nothing happened. He said he didn’t mean anything by it, and I chose to believe him. We were getting married in a few days and I didn’t want to throw everything away. But even though I tried to move on, a seed of doubt was planted. That “what if” followed me, especially whenever I noticed him getting close to other women.

**Six months after we got married, I was laid off from my job.** I tried everything to find another, with no luck. Another six months passed, and we moved abroad for his job. I was hopeful I’d have better chances there, but I’ve now been unemployed for a year and a half. I’m a software developer and I love my work, so not being able to contribute financially or professionally has taken a big toll on me.

When we moved, he started working right away. I was alone all day in a country where I didn’t speak the language and knew no one but him. I took care of the house, cooked, cleaned, ironed, and continued job hunting every day. We fought a lot. Money was tight. We used almost all of our savings for the move. He was under pressure. I was depressed. We talked about divorce, even about me returning to our home country, but neither of us wanted to separate. We endured.

All I wanted was a little more time together. A short walk, a cup of coffee. I didn’t want to spend the money he earned. I just wanted to feel less alone. Maybe I asked too much. Maybe he was too stressed to give more. But I never stopped loving him.

Eventually, he told me he couldn’t do it anymore. That he felt like he was failing me. That I’d be better off going back. I was devastated, but I agreed. I packed up, drove across countries alone, and returned home in two days. He didn’t help me much with the process but was kind to me before I left. Or so I thought.

**Half an hour after I left,** he changed his profile picture. A few days later, his Instagram too. A week later, he changed houses, sold my desk and chair, and bought a bike. All things he could’ve done before I left, but didn’t. Then he started being cold. I thought the distance might help us reconnect. But he seemed to shut the door completely. He refused to talk or work on things. He insisted on divorce. He blocked me from everything, and now neither he nor his family speaks to me. I got one call from his mother, and that was it. They used to call me their daughter.

**It’s been a month since this started.** We haven’t spoken in a week. The last thing he said was that I’ll see him in court. Two days ago was our anniversary. I waited for something… anything. But silence.

I don’t want to lose him. I still love him. But I’m also so tired. I feel like I’ve already lost everything. My job, my home, my sense of self. And now, him.

I don’t know what I’m hoping to hear, but thank you for reading. I guess I just needed to let this out.

**TL;DR:**  
We were together for 4 years and married for 2. After a tough year abroad where I couldn’t find a job and we both felt under pressure, my husband asked me to leave. Now I’m back in our home country, and he has blocked me on everything, wants a divorce, and refuses to talk. I still love him.

Ever since, my wife has started going out more — especially after she quit her job. She told me she wants to experience the nightlife, meet new people, and go to bars more often. I tried to support that even though it felt like she was pulling away.

Then she told me about a guy she met at a bar — said he was “nice.” A week or so later, I was on our shared computer and noticed she had Instagram still open. I saw a DM from that same guy saying “I’m here” — not “we’re here,” no mention of others. But when I asked her about it, she said she was out with a group. That discrepancy really stuck with me.

When I brought this up, she got furious. She accused me of being controlling and said she doesn’t owe me an explanation for what she does anymore. Since then, she’s started going out late (sometimes until bars close), won’t say where she’s going or who she’s with, and comes home giving me the cold shoulder or just completely locking me out emotionally.

She’s also changed all her passwords, so even if I wanted to confirm my suspicions, I can’t. That step felt very intentional and only raised more red flags.

Today she said she was going to get coffee. I asked to come along or suggested she grab something from CVS nearby, and she blew up, telling me again she doesn’t have to tell me anything. I’m walking on eggshells just asking simple questions.

Unfortunately, we’re stuck in a lease together for another 10 months, and I can’t afford to break it. That adds a whole new layer of tension to an already painful situation. Part of me does think maybe she just wants more freedom and independence in a new city, but the way she’s handling it—locking me out, changing passwords, staying vague about her whereabouts—feels like something deeper is going on.

I’m not trying to be controlling. I know this relationship can’t survive without trust, and right now there’s none. But I also feel like if I just stay quiet and observant, something will slip. Don’t you think she’ll eventually mess up or let something show? If she is hiding something, it can’t stay hidden forever.

So I guess my question is… am I overreacting? Or is my gut right? And what else can I look for, realistically, to get the clarity I need before this lease ends and I decide what to do?",6,1750196824.0,Infidelity,7,1.0,False
1ldzw3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ldzw3e/the_heretics_counsel/,The Heretic's Counsel,"The building hadn't improved since Marcus's last visit three years ago. If anything, it had gotten worse—more graffiti, more broken windows patched with cardboard, more of that particular smell that came from too many people crammed into too little space with not enough hope to go around.

Marcus climbed to the fourth floor, his knees reminding him that fifty-two was too old to be taking stairs two at a time. The hallway was lit by a single bulb that flickered like it was sending morse code to the roaches. Apartment 4B was at the end, its door covered in symbols that looked hand-carved, spiraling patterns that made his eyes water if he looked at them too long.

He knocked. No answer. Knocked again, harder.

""Aris, open up. It's Marcus.""

Movement inside. The scrape of multiple locks being undone. The door opened a crack, held by a chain that looked new and expensive—the only new thing in this shithole.

His brother's eye appeared in the gap, bloodshot and paranoid. ""You came.""

""Said I would.""

""Are you alone?""

""Jesus, Aris. Yes, I'm alone.""

More locks. The door swung open, and Marcus got his first good look at his brother in three years. Aris had always been thin, but now he was gaunt, cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass. His hair, once meticulously styled, hung in greasy strings. He wore a stained t-shirt and pajama pants that had seen better decades.

But his eyes—his eyes burned with the kind of intensity that could mean genius or madness. Marcus had never been sure which.

""Come in. Quickly.""

Marcus stepped inside and immediately understood why Aris had asked if he was alone. The apartment was a shrine to obsession.

Books covered every surface—ancient looking tomes with cracked leather spines, photocopied manuscripts held together with rubber bands, academic journals annotated in multiple colors of ink. The walls were covered in papers, photographs, maps, all connected by red string like something out of a conspiracy theorist's wet dream. Candles burned in corners, casting dancing shadows that made the whole place feel alive.

And the smell. Incense, yes, but underneath it something earthier. Like old churches. Like graves.

""You want coffee?"" Aris was already moving toward what Marcus assumed was a kitchen, though it was hard to tell under all the papers. ""I just made a pot. Ethiopian. Single origin. You have to grind it yourself, the pre-ground stuff loses its essence—""

""Aris.""

His brother stopped, turned. For a moment, he looked like the kid Marcus remembered—brilliant, eager to please, always talking too fast about things nobody else understood.

""Right. The symbol."" Aris moved to a wall covered in photographs. Crime scenes, Marcus realized. Some he recognized from the case files Lisa had pulled. Others were new. Older. ""You saw it at the Vance scene. The serpent and wing.""

""How did you know about that?""

""I told you. I have sources."" Aris pulled down a photograph, handed it to Marcus. ""This is from 1873. London. A member of Parliament found with his organs arranged in a semicircle. And this—"" Another photo. ""Berlin, 1934. A rabbi. Same arrangement. Same symbol painted in blood.""

Marcus studied the photos. They were grainy, old, but the similarity was undeniable. ""These could be faked.""

""They're not."" Aris moved to his desk, started pulling out files. ""I've spent seven years tracking this. Seven years of my life, Marcus. My career, my reputation, everything—gone. But I was right. I was fucking right.""

""About what?""

Aris laughed, high and manic. ""The Cult of the Black Horizon. They're not new. They're old. Older than you can imagine. And they're not killing randomly.""

He spread papers across the desk—photocopies of ancient texts, translations scrawled in margins, diagrams that hurt to look at.

""They worship Lilitu,"" Aris continued. ""An ancient goddess. Older than Babylon, older than Sumer. Goddess of murder and betrayal. The serpent eating itself represents the cycle of death and rebirth. The wing..."" He traced the symbol with one finger. ""The wing is her mark. She was cast out, you see. Sealed away by the other gods. But her followers believe she can return.""

""Through murder.""

""Through sacrifice. Specific sacrifice."" Aris pulled out a leather journal, its pages filled with cramped handwriting. ""Every killing follows a pattern. Location, timing, victim selection—it's all deliberate. They're not just killing, Marcus. They're preparing.""

""For what?""

""Her resurrection."" Aris's eyes gleamed. ""The prophecy speaks of a vessel. A human who will serve as her anchor in this world. When the stars align—literally align, the conjunction happens next month—they'll perform the final ritual. Lilitu will inhabit the vessel, and..."" He gestured at the chaotic apartment. ""Hell on earth. Literally.""

Marcus rubbed his temples. This was exactly why he'd stopped talking to his brother. The brilliant kid who'd gotten a full ride to University of Chicago, who'd published papers at twenty-two, who could have been anything—reduced to this. A madman in a filthy apartment, seeing patterns in chaos.

""Aris, listen to yourself. Ancient goddesses? Prophecies? This is—""

""Insane?"" Aris's smile was bitter. ""That's what the tenure committee said. Right before they found Professor Morrison dead in his office, organs in a semicircle.""

That stopped Marcus cold. ""What?""

""Two months after they rejected my thesis. Morrison led the committee. He was... particularly cruel in his assessment."" Aris turned away. ""I tried to warn him. Sent him everything I'd found. He laughed. Called security. Had me removed from campus.""

""And then he died.""

""Then he died."" Aris pulled out a newspaper clipping. The headline read ""University Professor Found Dead in Apparent Ritual Killing."" The date was three years ago. Right around when Aris had stopped returning Marcus's calls.

""Why didn't you tell me?""

""Would you have believed me?"" Aris's voice was soft. ""Would you have done anything except what you're doing now—looking at me like I'm crazy?""

Marcus wanted to argue, but his brother was right. Three years ago, he would have written it off as coincidence. Academic rivalry gone wrong. Anything but what Aris was suggesting.

""Walk me through it,"" he said finally. ""All of it. Pretend I believe you.""

Aris's face lit up like Christmas morning. He started pulling out more files, talking fast, that manic energy that had always made him hard to follow.

""The cult operates in cells. No central leadership that I can find, but they communicate somehow. The killings cluster—three or four in a region, then nothing for years. Like they're building up to something, then going dormant.""

He spread out a map of the United States, red pins marking locations. Chicago had one pin—Vance.

""The victims aren't random either. Politicians, religious leaders, academics—people with influence. People whose deaths would cause ripples."" Aris pulled out photos of victims. ""But there's another pattern. Something I didn't see until recently.""

He arranged the photos chronologically. Marcus saw it immediately—as the timeline progressed, the victims got younger.

""They're working backward,"" he said.

""Not backward. Inward."" Aris grabbed a marker, started drawing on a clear sheet of plastic overlaid on the map. ""Each killing creates a kind of... thinning. A weak point between our world and wherever Lilitu is imprisoned. The younger the victim, the more years of life stolen, the stronger the effect.""

""So they're building up to—""

""Someone young. Someone special. The vessel."" Aris's hands shook as he pulled out another file. ""I think they've already chosen. The timing, the escalation—it all points to the final ritual happening soon.""

""How soon?""

""The conjunction is November 15th. Four weeks."" Aris met his eyes. ""Marcus, they're not going to stop. Vance was just the beginning. There will be more bodies, more sacrifices, all leading up to their endgame.""

Marcus picked up one of the ancient texts, pages brittle with age. The symbols on it seemed to writhe in the candlelight. ""And you got all this from old books? From myths?""

""Not myths. History."" Aris took the book carefully, set it aside. ""The cult has existed for millennia, Marcus. Different names, different faces, but always the same goal. They've tried before—1888 in London, 1934 in Berlin, 1969 in Los Angeles. Each time, something went wrong. The vessel wasn't right, or someone interfered, or the stars weren't properly aligned.""

""But this time is different?""

""This time they've had decades to prepare. To get their people in place. To find the perfect vessel."" Aris pulled out a folder marked with symbols that made Marcus's head hurt. ""The vessel has to be specific. Young, female, with certain... qualities. Creative types, usually. Artists, writers. Always isolated in some way. And most importantly, she has to have the mark.""

""What mark?""

""It varies. Sometimes a birthmark, sometimes scarring that appears during stress. But always in the shape of scales. Serpentine."" Aris showed him drawings, photographs of skin conditions that looked almost like tattoos. ""The mark identifies her as compatible with Lilitu's spirit.""

Marcus thought of the business card from the Vance scene. ""The Black Horizon. That's what they call themselves?""

""One of many names. They've been the Order of the Crimson Serpent, the Children of the Void, the Disciples of the First Murder."" Aris laughed, but there was no humor in it. ""Marketing changes. The mission doesn't.""

""And you've been tracking them for seven years.""

""Since I found references in some pre-Babylonian tablets during my doctoral research. Everyone thought I was reading too much into it. Seeing connections that weren't there."" Aris gestured at his walls of evidence. ""But then the patterns started emerging. Deaths that matched the old rituals. Symbols that shouldn't exist anymore. And always, always, whispers of something coming. Something final.""

Marcus stood, paced the small apartment. Part of him wanted to dismiss all of this as his brother's delusions. But the symbol at the Vance scene, the arrangement of the body, the business card...

""Let's say I believe you,"" he said slowly. ""What do they do next?""

""More killings. They'll happen faster now. Each one younger than the last, building power for the final ritual."" Aris pulled out a calendar, dates circled in red. ""Based on the pattern, the next one should be within days. Female, early twenties, someone with influence or connection to power.""

""And the vessel?""

""They'll already have her identified. Probably have someone close to her, watching, guiding her toward the ritual."" Aris's voice dropped. ""She won't know what she is. Not yet. But she'll be having dreams. Visions of Lilitu. Her body will start changing, showing the marks. The cult will interpret this as the goddess calling to her.""

""How do we find her?""

""Look for young women reporting unusual dreams to doctors or therapists. Check hospital records for unexplained skin conditions. Watch social media for mentions of serpent dreams or visions of multi-armed figures."" Aris grabbed Marcus's arm, his grip desperate. ""But be careful. The cult has people everywhere. Hospitals, police departments, government offices. Anyone could be one of them.""

""Come on, Aris. You really think—""

""I know."" His brother's eyes were deadly serious. ""How do you think I've survived this long? Why do you think I live like this?"" He gestured at the locks, the symbols on the door. ""They killed Chen for laughing at them. They've killed others who got too close. The only reason I'm still alive is because they think I'm a harmless lunatic.""

Marcus pulled free, disturbed by the certainty in his brother's voice. ""I need to think about this.""

""There's no time to think!"" Aris grabbed a manila folder, shoved it at Marcus. ""Take this. Copies of everything. Photos, translations, patterns. Study it. You'll see I'm right.""

""Aris—""

""They're going to kill again, Marcus. Soon. And when they do, remember that I tried to warn you."" His voice broke. ""Remember that your crazy brother tried to save lives.""

Marcus took the folder, heavy with papers. ""I'll look at it.""

""That's all I ask."" Aris walked him to the door, started undoing the locks. ""Marcus? Be careful who you trust. Even your partner. Even your captain. The cult is patient. They put people in place years, sometimes decades in advance.""

""You're saying someone in my department—""

""I'm saying trust no one."" Aris opened the door, peered out nervously. ""And if you start having dreams about serpents, if you see symbols appearing on walls, if you notice people watching you... run. Run far and fast.""

Marcus stepped into the hallway, turned back. His brother looked small in the doorway, surrounded by his madness, protected by his symbols.

""The baseball cards,"" Aris said suddenly. ""The ones Dad gave us. I kept yours. They're in storage unit 47B on Halsted. Just... in case you ever wanted them back.""

""Aris—""

""Go. Before someone sees you here. Before they connect us."" He started to close the door, then stopped. ""Marcus? I know you think I'm insane. But when the next body shows up—and it will—remember what I told you. Young. Female. Closer to the vessel.""

The door closed. Locks clicked back into place.

Marcus stood in the flickering hallway, holding a folder full of impossibilities. Seven years of his brother's life reduced to photocopies and theories. The ravings of a madman, or a warning that had cost Aris everything to deliver.

His phone buzzed. Lisa.

""Where are you? Rodriguez is asking questions.""

""Following up on something. I'll be back soon.""

""The lab found something on that business card. The paper—it's old, Marcus. Like, really old. And the ink... they can't identify the composition.""

Marcus felt cold. ""What do you mean?""

""I mean it's not any modern ink they've seen. The tech actually said it looked more like blood mixed with something else. Something alive."" Lisa paused. ""This case is getting weird.""

""Yeah,"" Marcus said, looking back at his brother's door. ""Weird.""

He hung up, headed for the stairs. In his car, he set the folder on the passenger seat, stared at it like it might bite. Inside were answers to questions he wasn't sure he wanted to ask. Patterns that suggested something impossible. Evidence of a world beneath the world he knew.

Marcus had been a cop for twenty-three years. He believed in evidence, in facts, in things that could be proven in court. He didn't believe in ancient goddesses or death cults or prophecies.

But he'd seen the symbol. Seen how the organs were arranged. Seen the reverence in the killer's work.

And now his brother—brilliant, broken Aris—had given him a roadmap to something that shouldn't exist.

Marcus started the engine, pulled into traffic. He had a job to do, a killer to catch. But now he also had questions that wouldn't leave him alone. Questions about vessels and prophecies and cults that had survived for millennia.

He'd read Aris's files. He'd follow the evidence, wherever it led. Even if it led to places that made no sense in a sane world.

Because if Aris was right—if even half of what he claimed was true—then Chicago was running out of time. Four weeks until something called the conjunction. Four weeks to find a killer who might not be entirely human, serving a goddess who shouldn't exist.

Marcus drove through the familiar streets, the folder beside him feeling heavier with each passing block. He'd always been good at his job. Time to find out if he was good enough to solve a case that broke all the rules he'd lived by.

Time to find out if madness really was contagious.

Because the alternative—that Aris was right, that something ancient and hungry was stirring in the shadows of his city—was too terrible to contemplate.

But he'd contemplate it anyway. He was a cop. That's what cops did. They looked at terrible things and tried to make sense of them.

Even when sense was the last thing those terrible things made.",1,1750196812.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Most SuperTrend indicators use fixed ATR multipliers that ignore context—forcing traders to constantly tweak settings that rarely adapt well across timeframes or assets.  
  
This Supertrend is a nodd to and a more completion of the work  
done by Olivier Seban  
  
This version replaces guesswork with an adaptive factor based on prior session volatility, dynamically adjusting stops to match current conditions. It also introduces liquidity-aware zones, real-time strength histograms, and a visual control panel—making your stoploss smarter, more responsive, and aligned with how the market actually moves.

**The Multiplier Problem & Adaptive Factor Solution**

[**https://www.tradingview.com/x/BEXaTWHF/**](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BEXaTWHF/)  
Traditional SuperTrend indicators rely on fixed ATR multipliers—often arbitrary numbers like 1.5, 2, or 3. The issue? No logical basis ties these values to actual market conditions. What works on a 5-minute Nasdaq chart fails on a daily EUR/USD chart. Traders spend hours tweaking multipliers per asset, timeframe, or volatility phase—and still end up with stoplosses that are either too tight or too loose. Worse, the market doesn’t care about your setting—it behaves according to underlying volatility, not your parameter.  
  
This version fixes that by automating the multiplier selection entirely. It uses a 4-zone model based on the current ATR relative to the previous session’s ATR, dynamically adjusting the SuperTrend factor to match current volatility. It eliminates guesswork, adapts to the asset and timeframe, and ensures you’re always using a context-aware stoploss—one that evolves with the market instead of fighting it.  
  
**ATR EXAMPLE**  
Let’s say prior session ATR = 2.00  
Now suppose current ATR = 0.32  
This places us in Zone 1 (Very Low Volatility)  
It doesn’t imply ""overbought"" or ""oversold"" — it tells you the market is moving very little, which often means:  
Lower risk | Smaller stops | Smaller opportunities (and losses)

The standard SuperTrend stop loss line often looks like price “barely misses it” before continuing its trend. Traders call this ""stop hunting,"" but what’s really happening is liquidity collection—price pulls back into a zone rich in orders before continuing. The problem? The old SuperTrend doesn’t show this zone. It only draws the outer limit, leaving no visual cue for where entries or continuation moves might realistically originate.  
  
This script introduces 2 levels in the Liquidity Zone. One for Support and one for Stophunts, which draw dynamically between the current price and the SuperTrend line. These levels reflect where the market is most likely to revisit before resuming the trend. By visualizing the area just above the Supertrend stop loss, you can anticipate pullbacks, spot ideal re-entries, and avoid premature exits. This bridges the gap between mechanical stoploss logic and real-world liquidity behavior.  
  
⏳ **Prior Session ATR vs. Live ATR**  
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ueOv1Kll/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ueOv1Kll/)  
Using real-time ATR to determine movement potential is like driving by looking in your rearview mirror. It’s reactive, not predictive. Traders often base decisions on live ATR, unaware that **today’s range is still unfolding**—creating volatility mismatches between what’s calculated and what actually matters. Since ATR reflects range, calculating it mid-session gives an incomplete and misleading picture of true volatility.  
  
Instead, this system uses the **ATR from the previous session**, anchoring your volatility assumptions in a **fully-formed price structure**. It tells you how far price moved in the last full market phase—be it London, New York, or Tokyo—giving you a more reliable gauge of expected range today. This is a smarter way to estimate how far price could move rather than how far it has moved.  
  
The Smoothing function will take the ATR, Support, Resistance, Stophunt Levels, and the Moving Avearage and smooth them by the calculation you choose.  
It will also plot a moving average on your chart against closing prices by the smoothing function you choose.  
  
🧭 **Scalping vs. Trending Modes**  
*The market moves in at least 4 phases. Trending, Ranging, Consolidation, Distribution.*  
Every trader has a **different style**—some scalp low-volatility moves during off-hours, while others ride macro trends across days. The problem with classic SuperTrend? It treats every market condition the same. A fixed system can’t possibly provide proper stoploss spacing for both a fast scalp and a long-term swing. Traders are forced to rebuild their system every time the market changes character or the session shifts.  
  
*This version solves that with a simple toggle:*  
  
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/tBe4q2IW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tBe4q2IW/)  
**Scalping or Trend Mode**. With one switch, it inverts the logic of the adaptive factor to either tighten or loosen your trailing stops. During low-liquidity hours or consolidation phases, Scalping Mode offers snug stoplosses. During expansion or clear directional bias.  
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddcBtRtL/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddcBtRtL/)  
  
**Trend Mode** lets the trade breathe. This is flexibility built directly into the logic—not something you have to recalibrate manually.  
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/pdLcFZne/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pdLcFZne/)  
📉 **Histogram Oscillator for Move Strength**  
In legacy indicators, there’s no built-in way to **gauge when the move is losing power**. Traders rely on price action or momentum indicators to guess if a trend is fading. But this adds clutter, lag, and often contradiction. The classic SuperTrend doesn’t offer insight into **how strong or weak** the current trend leg is—only whether price has crossed a line.  
  
This version includes a **Trending Liquidity Histogram** —a histogram that shows whether the liquidity in the SuperTrend zone is expanding or compressing. When the bars weaken or cross toward zero, it signals **liquidity exhaustion**. This early warning gives you time to prep for reversals or anticipate pullbacks. It even adapts visually depending on your trading mode, showing color-coded signals for scalping vs. trending behavior. It's both a strength gauge and a trade timing tool—built into your stoploss logic.  
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/PAHXGgih/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PAHXGgih/)  
  
📊 **Visual Table for Real-Time Clarity**  
A major issue with custom indicators is **opacity**—you don’t always know what settings or values are currently being used. Even worse, if your dynamic logic changes mid-trade, you may not notice unless you go digging into the code or logs. This can create confusion, especially for discretionary traders.  
  
This SuperTrend solves it with a clean **visual summary table** right on your chart. It shows your current ATR value, adaptive multiplier, trailing stop level, and whether a new zone size is active. That means no surprises and no second-guessing—everything important is visible and updated in real-time.",1,1750196664.0,TradingView,0,1.0,False

Besides writing alot more; I remember and realize this talent again; my original dream that I had denied myself; I wanted to make jewelry and already being a widely published writer; I wanted to write my own books/novels... and travel and sell jewelry at music events from my car... (I maybe don't want to do the music festival thing so crazy, but from a removed entrepreneurial standpoint, and also to maybe get back into flow art l, of course). I finally allowed myself to remember... I counted how many peices of jewelry I have made/remade in the past couple of weeks or so (8). I am getting better and faster at it each day... I've always made necklaces and bracelets for my friends, ever since I was a kid, and again during/after highschool...

I am surrounded by artists now... and they just laugh and play sports when they aren't working or making art... humans were meant to live like this... while writing this I got a new idea for another bracelet and became longing for materials.

I allowed myself to remember I am fleak and fleet footed on the field; even at mid 30s. I need some practice/soft cleats... I destroyed a pro set of athletic shoes in one session... wow...

I have been asking God for guidance; I'm finally hearing/reading about Aaron in the book of Alma... it is crazy, I feel elements of myself and my story in these chapters, it is very uncanny. I'm sleeping In alot more now too...  no more coffee; no more tea, no more beer to fall asleep, this promise I vow to keep... it's hard, but worth it.
I need to pray about this; all of it.
I am nervous about my next interview at the church, idk if it is today or when... I get nervous the church will reject me, and I pray that they won't; I get a buzzing feeling washing over me telling me it's going to be okay, and that I am loved no matter what. And if things fail there, I am forever grateful to the two sisters who helped me out of the darkness, if I do have to leave them one day, they reminded me of who I truly need to be; they are bringing back my true gift of tongues, I was speaking Spanish and French yesterday, I broke my streak on duo for everything (including arabic,needed a break), but I think I will add Spanish as well, just to keep the language juices flowing. I would love to go on mission knowing all those languages, I wonder where they would send me... if all fails, I can always go back to my roots as a 4square/non-denominational christian; we're very adaptive like that. But I really want this to be home, this feels like home. I also want to research seers in the church as well... and see what I find about that. Maybe after becoming a missionary, my calling might be as a seer? I'm curious... and seers in my original faith/doctrine are forbidden... I wonder... I must pray about this as well.

I think I am going to watch some videos about these things ( Aaron/ Alma); and read more today after that; then play video games (on my phone); get rid of my TV (dont want it no more), budget for gas and food for the next two days, start going to the hot meal center (it keeps me humble and saves money).

This phone is going to be permanently shut off soon. Then both phones will get wiped again before I change to a completely new phone and number/email address/everything; I might even change my name if it's not too expensive; and then hopefully passports; maybe change the name after passports idk, that still depends on some things ... all old things are fading into the blackness and disappearing; and I will rise anew. This is the muddy black water, I am almost fully submerged... this is the dark ritual made into light.

This is what inevitable truly looks like lol, this is what happens when I work together with god... and God within me...

nag 6:30pm na and sa gitna ng pagkkwento ko sakaniya bigla nya tinawagan yung jowa nya para mangamusta and pinakita nya ko sa cam so i said hi and i even told him to come with us next time. then sabi ni bff ""sunduin mo kami, nilibre ako ni (me)"" so naisip ko better kasi yung dadaanan ng kotse nila is malapit sa subd namin so pwede nila ako idrop off sa harap lang ng subd like the usual na ginagawa nila everytime na niyayaya nila ako. tas umokay yung jowa nya, then inantay namin dumating. pagdating nya, nag usap sila na pumunta doon sa kabilang mall kasi nandoon yung friends ng mom ng jowa nya (na-meet ko na kasi pinaglutuan ko sila once ng food kasi request ni bff, may sakit kasi si jowa) so go, sumama nalang ako kasi sabi nila. tapos nandon na sila sa coffee shop, nagbatian, binati ko rin mom nya, and maya maya nag cr ako, pagbalik ko nakita ko nakapila na sila and naguusap, isip isip ko pa kung ano oorderin ko and tinignan ko pa kung may signal ba para makaconnect ako sa gcash, then nagulat ako sabi ni bff ""diba pinapauwi kana ng fam mo?"" sabi ko ""ha?"" then sabi nya ""diba tinatawagan kana?"" tinignan ko kung may missed call ba wala naman, naalala ko lang kanina tinawagan ako kung may susi ba ko dala. sabi ko nalang ""oo bakit?"" tas ayun na naka feel na ko na parang pinapauwi na nya ko. siguro kasi kasama na nya mom ng bf nya? or dahil feeling nya sasagutin nila coffee ko kasi oorder na sila? ewan, basta ang off na. sabi ko ""uwi na ko."" sabi ni bff ""sige, kasi baka matagalan din kami dito eh anong oras na."" nag offer naman ibook ako ni bff ng grab pero tinanggihan ko. ang ending ako nalang umuwi mag isa, hindi na muna ako nagpakita ng ilang buwan after that.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Prediction: Indiana Fever to Roast Connecticut Sun Like a WNBA Turkey Dinner**

The Indiana Fever, led by the incomparable Caitlin Clark, are all but guaranteed to turn the Connecticut Sun into a charred husk tonight. With the Sun staggering into Indianapolis at 1-4 on the road and ranking dead last in both offensive *and* defensive efficiency (a true double-whammy of incompetence), this game feels less like a basketball match and more like a mercy killing.

**Key Stats & Odds:**

* **Moneyline:** Indiana (-17.5) is a near-certainty at 1.05/1.06 odds, while Connecticut (+17.5) sits at 10-11, roughly the same chance as a snowball surviving a sauna.
* **Spread:** Bet the Fever -17.5 at 1.91-1.95 odds. They’ll likely obliterate that number, especially after their 102-88 beatdown of the Liberty with Clark dropping a near-triple-double.
* **Totals:** The Over 165.5-166.0 is a lock at 1.85-1.95 odds. Indiana’s offense, with Clark as the conductor, will run like a drunk toddler on a tricycle—chaotic, unstoppable, and slightly tragic to watch.

**Player Prop to Watch:**

* **Caitlin Clark O/U 36.5 combined points, rebounds, assists** (Over at -110). She’s basically a human triple-threat, and “36+” feels like setting the over/under on a volcano.

**Why It’s a Joke:**  
The Sun’s only hope is Marina Mabrey and Tina Charles performing a Houdini act from a team that’s been outscored by 15+ points in four straight road games. Good luck, Connecticut. The Fever’s margin of victory will likely make the spread look like a rounding error.

**Bonus Bet Tip:**  
New to sports betting? DraftKings is handing out a “Bet $5, Get $300” promo—because nothing says “I trust this team” like risking less than a small coffee. Just don’t blame me when you’re $300 richer and the Sun’s season is already dead.

**Final Score Prediction:** Indiana 98, Connecticut 73. (Sun’s actual score might be lower if they keep shooting like they’re at a family reunion.)

Hi looking for advice on if it’s a turn off to be super forward on a first date? 

Cole’s notes: I haven’t really put any effort in my 20s to dating as was busy with school and work and honestly I’m very independent with lots of hobbies that it never became a priority for me. 

Now I’m 29 and would like to get married and have kids and not a lot of time to waste. 

I’m not very good talking over text but I love in person. I met this guy online and I like what he’s about - we didn’t talk that much but he asked me out for coffee and walk within a day or so. 

Now the question— would you as a guy be offended if a woman on a first date straight up laid out expectations — assuming that I feel we are vibing with each other? 

I know what I have to offer which is:

- stable job and good income, educated, family oriented, no serious hang ups, finances in check/no debt, quite independent (lol probs as a result of being single and having to do everything for yourself haha)

But also that I want kids and to be married one day… and that it’s very important to me. And I expect in general the man I end up with to be able to offer an equal amount to what I’m bringing to the table. 

Would you be scared off if someone said that to you?? Should I hold off for now?

I guess I just want the guy to know not to waste my time if he’s not feeling it and I’m not about a fling. 

I’ve often said, I would be a prime candidate for an arranged marriage, but alas the dating world it is.

I have one below, any feedback at all would be appreciated:

It's summer. Slowly the cloud of winter has been burned away and I find myself lounging like a cat in the sun. A cat who drinks and as of recently smokes. I know the smoking is bad but I tell myself it's not a problem - that I'll only smoke when I drink. I've never been partial to a drink and so I considered that I'd found a sustainable solution. But as the summer went on I found myself finding excuses to drink so that I could smoke. I'm between jobs, I was made redundant in April but I have a little pile of money to sleep on. My partner was made redundant the month after me and so we're cats together. Cycling to nearby pubs and posting up for a day of drinking, talking, lounging and smoking. So far the summer has passed in a blissful haze. I don't have too long until the money pile goes from little to meagre but long enough to not think about it.

It was quarter past twelve on a Tuesday morning as we wheeled our bikes through the hallway of our apartment building. The click of the freewheel filled the hall, we'd no need to talk over it. Meg wore a long flowing summer dress with flowers on it, as we got outside the breeze lent it a limp flow. She mounted her bike gracefully as I clumsily whipped my leg over the seat.

""You go in front.""

And off she pedalled, I followed between the tall apartment blocks. The roads were quiet and so we cycled in the middle. We left the road into the dirty scrub that moats the development and followed a path to the bridge that would take us over the river. Once across we wended our way down to an old towpath by the river and keep pedalling, the sewage works passed on our right, now we're upwind. We crossed again over a bridge at a river lock. There was a barge  with some holidaymakers waiting. The gates were closed and the level was slowly dipping, gently lowering the barge down the level of the river. We carry on along the other side. For a few minutes ride, then the silence broken by a sudden:

""Ooh.""

A noise I've grown to love. Somewhere between a wood pigeon and an owl. I hear it 30 times a day and know it means a sudden surprise within the range of there could be a bee on the path or she's fallen off of a cliff. I come to a stop behind her, clamber off of my bike and walk up behind her.

""The path's fallen away.""

So it had. ""You'll have to swim it.""

She shot me an unimpressed look. While the gorge through the path was a few foot deep the water was maybe an inch although a few feet wide. Unsteadily, she inched down the near slope, hopped to a branch in the middle and then to the far slope on the other side. I wheeled the bikes over to her and then she sent her hand to guide me across.

""You're the clumsy one here.""

I sent one foot to the branch. It rocked under my sole. I looked up to see her hand and earnest face. I thought I'd save myself some wet feet and grabbed it. 

 

We rode on. We coasted up the drive of the pub and wheeled our bikes into the garden. Meg began her watch and I went in to get the rations flowing. And so we lounged. I would chase the shade of the umbrella around the circular picnic table, trying to not get burned and she would brave the sun. A little Tupperware container sat on the table with tobacco and we rolled each other cigarettes nattering the day away with maybe 8 other people in pub garden that could seat 80. We ate lunch, pointed at birds and guess what they were, quietly talk about the other patrons and what circumstances had gotten them there on a Tuesday afternoon. All the while we steamed ourselves on beer. 8, 9, 10 pints in, the work crowd began to emerge. At first just the workshy in drips and drabs but by 5 o'clock the place was lousy with them. Meg would've stayed there until the bar staff had to chase her out with a broom but the presence of others having a good time annoys me and so we left.

 

Sore from the hard seat I eased myself up with my hands and felt the familiar feeling of dizziness. I waited for it to pass, picked up my bike, hobbled onto it and let gravity pull me down the drive. A few wobbles but nothing life threatening. The gravel crunched beneath me. The air was fresh and as I gulped it I saw Meg pass me and turn back onto the towpath. I rounded the corner into the wind and saw her with one hand on the handle bars and another in her lap.

""What're you doing?""

""Watch!""

She lifted her hand over her head. A blast of colour as the dress billowed up to her face. The hand shot down.

""I hope you've got pants on!""

I heard her cackle to herself. We went on slowly, retracing our path from the way in. We lost the sun to the apartment blocks as we neared our development. As always the protracted evening sunset of summer added a melancholic note to my stomach. We dismount at our building and the serenade of the clicking freewheels once again played us through the hall. We set the bikes against the table and they resume their secondary purpose of cluttering our overcrammed apartment. I walk over and squeeze her hips.

""So what're we eating?""

""What do you want? There's nothing in the fridge.""

""We have cheese?""

Her eyebrows raise and her head tilts a degree forward.

""I know the brie is old but it'll be good.""

Ascent. We put the oven on and set to work raiding the cupboards. Some stale crackers from Christmas and a jar of chutney that I was sure came with us in our last move. Another couple of beers and we began nattering about nothing in particular. Finally we sit at the coffee table with our oven baked brie and its accoutrements, watching the tele and making little comments to each other - honouring inside jokes that are at this point a decade old, expressing surprise and sensed irony with noises and glances.

I'm a 24-year-old woman who just started working. My life, that was like a roller coaster, has now settled down. Now that it has come to this, I find myself looking for love again.

People say I'm young and that I shouldn't rush. I am not in a rush. But I want to know how it feels to be loved by someone that isn't family or friends. I've never ever been in a romantic relationship. I've only ever been in situationships and hookups. In these so-called ""relations"" I've had, I always felt empty. The pleasure and fun—fleeting.

I don't go to clubs. I'm boring company. I go out and hang out at a coffee shop just to escape from reality. I don't have hobbies where I interact with other people. I know this needs to change but I can't right now. Budget is tight. Time is limited.

So, I went to the next thing I know that is accessible to me. I went online dating. I pick ""arangan"" looking men. I don't choose the ""gwapos"" because I think they're too good to be true and impossible for them to notice me. I met someone but all he wanted in the end was my body. As all the others do. Do I look easy? Probably.

Anyway, let me tell you about the pleas of a girl who just wants to love and be loved.

I want to be pursued.
Yes, demanding I know, but I want to know how it feels to experience someone pursuing me. To make an effort for me. I want to know how it feels to receive compliments or flowers. I've only ever received three bouquets my entire life and all on my birthdays (thanks, fam!). How does it feel to receive from a man? Will I blush? Will I get shy? I don’t know. I just really want to know what nililigawan feels like.

I want to go out on dates. 
I've never been on a date. Let alone be asked out on a date. 
Dates—may it be simple or adventurous or chill. I would love them all if it's with you.

I want…
Someone willing to get to know me.
Someone who will be there for me as I will be for them.
Someone who will communicate and compromise with me as we shape our lives together.
Someone who will not give up on me just like how I'll never give up on them.
Someone who will choose me and love me for me just as how I choose them and love them.
Someone who loves deep talks as much as I do.
Someone who matches my freak—ifykyk.
I want someone safe and warm. Kind and reassuring.
Someone who will stay. Please stay.

I won't ask for much, but I hope you come soon. The doubts in my head keep creeping in. The loneliness I feel now feels like a shadow constantly following me.

There's so much more in my mind right now. More to express, but sadly, my longing for you is louder than ever.

Someone, I really hope you're out there.

A Girl Who Just Wants to Love and Be Loved",2,1750196071.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1ldzcoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1ldzcoz/optimum_ingredient_value_why_farfetchd_might_be/,"Optimum Ingredient Value, Why Farfetch'd might be very strong, and why we'll likely never see a Mono-tail mon.","So after recently learning that ingredient amounts for Base/30/60 were determined based on the value of the A ingredient, that got me thinking. What could would be the best ingredient spread for each A ingredient in the A slot, to maximize value on each ingredient help.

After trying to find out exactly what the formula was, failing, and having to somewhat guess and reverse engineer the rate I settled on the following assumptions:  
1. All mons are designed as 1/2/4 spread on A/B/C for their A ingredient (I.e Pikachu A/A/A is 1/2/4)  
2. The amount generated for B + C ingredients is the sum of the ingredients (e.g 2x90 for Apples in Pikachu's B slot) divided by the ingredient value of the corresponding ingredient (e.g Ginger is 109, so 180/109 = 1.6... rounded up to 2, not floored or ceil'd).  
3. The amount of ingredients for an ingredient specialist is 2x that amount (this also matches how berry mons work with berries), pre-rounding, then rounded after doubling. (E.g If Pikachu was an Ingredient specialist, 180/109\*2 = 3.3... rounded down to 3 ginger in slot B)

This then highlighted an immidiate issue, non-ingredient mons have 1/2/4 spread, but ingredient mons have a 2/5/7 spread, clearly 2x2!=5 and 2x4!=7. If we assume internally, that 1/2/4 is actually 1/2.25/3.5 then we still round non ingredient mons correctly, but now Ingredient mons also round up correctly. It also nicely scales 1.25 per tier.

Checking this against existing pokemon showed a few holes, firstly some pokemon were coming out a bit under budget e.g Mankey's C ingredient. So I upped that from 3.5 to 3.65 after some down tweaking elsewhere.

This finally gave me a spot where it fit all the mons I tested. So now onto the juicy calculations!

These are the best combinations of ingredients:

[Table of A\/B\/C ingredient spreads for the most 'value' per ingredient help](https://preview.redd.it/idepzcx2uj7f1.png?width=385&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a66b1a66e46900992ef75096dd5969c95f7cb3)

In some cases Tails was the best ingredient, so I also added the 2nd best as that's less likely to be on any future mons.

As you can see, we actually have one of the layouts here already, Gengar A/B/B.  
\*Darkrai is classed as an Apple A ingredient regardless what you pickup, and amazingly they can't get Eggs or Leeks.

So what does this mean? Well, not much - it was mostly a thought experiment, the gains are comparable to the event bonus though of 1 per help between the best + worst spreads (\~0.75 A ingredients per ingredient help, taking Oil as an example)

In terms of comparing between pokemon, well now you have to take into account ingredient rate and it essentially makes it a worthless metric.

\--------

So, now I've built the spreadsheet what does this mean for Farfetch'd? Well, if we're assuming it's an A ingredient for Leeks (and an Ingredient Specialist), then this is the most powerful A ingredient we've had on a pokemon yet.  
Now we know B and C are derived from the value of the A ingredient, we end up with this beautiful table of possibilities for how many they may produce.

[Leek 'A' Ingredient type ingredient spreads](https://preview.redd.it/vrfvhx2mxj7f1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=c51fdf0f1755a456503ba456afb33cf034a20d62)

Now, if I'm a betting woman - I'd say Eggs are fairly likely to be on the list. That means Farfetch'd could be a solid Egg A/B/B, collecting 7/12 eggs in the B and C slots.  
Compared to Blissey who outputs 14 eggs per 3 ingredient helps, an A/B/B Farfetch'd collects 19, plus 2 leeks.  
So now it comes down to Speed + Ingredient rate. Blissey is one of the slower speed tiers at 3100s, and 23.8% ingredient rate, which is in the upper half. If Farfetch'd is reasonably fast, or middling on it's ingredient rate, it'll likely outperform Blissey for Eggs at 60.  
In the event Eggs aren't the B ingredient, it might compete or beat whatever the current mono is for that ingredient anyway.

  
\--------

Finally, why we may never see a mono-tail mon. The fact is, the Tail ingredient is just too powerful, it inflates every other ingredient to the moon. As you can see from this table:

[Tails 'A' Ingredient type ingredient spreads](https://preview.redd.it/1yzlg0txzj7f1.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab5513819f1c4cdcd7c514cce68f2340fc273fa)

Even the next best ingredient, Leek, would almost fill Farfetch'd's base level pokemon inventory in 1 trigger. Sure, we have something similar with Absol, but you choose any other ingredients and it gets even worse. The game just isn't designed with the idea that Tails could be a mono ingredient, it would blow every other mono out the water for it's B ingredient, and likely it's C ingredient too.

1ldzcmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1ldzcmk/wife_cried_because_i_didnt_think_of_her/,Wife cried because I didn’t think of her,"For context, we had gotten in a fight before about the same thing maybe 3-5 months ago. Me getting something from fast food after work and not asking if she wants something. I work 30 min away from home at a factory and know she usually makes dinner, however the first time I was hungry and stopped for something on the way home. I let it slip that I got food and she was very upset with me. 
She said it was because it made her feel unappreciated because I ate instead of waiting until I got home for dinner as well as feeling like I don’t think of her. I made the same mistake today of getting a coffee and mcchicken and she was upset to the point of tears today as well.
First time we communicated she’d like it if I gave thanks or showed appreciation when she made dinner and I now do that, I don’t think there was much else beyond asking her if she wants something in the future. Today, however, she’s connecting it to a general feeling of feeling like I don’t think of her and that she brings me stuff when she gets things. 
This is true usually though there are times when it isn’t but I’ve never expressed frustration that she didn’t bring me something. I understand I should be doing more and could express my gratitude for things like the house being clean when I come back from work (she works about 1/4 to 1/3 of the time I work so she takes care of most of the cleaning). 
I just am frustrated and think it is too much that she gets this upset when I don’t ask her if she wants something the 2 times in 6 months I got something after work. Our relationship is otherwise great and she has expressed the same. I’ll try to give her more gifts and express thanks but other than that does anybody have advice or thoughts? 
She is a great wife and I understand mistakes were made on my end but this level of reaction really irks me 

tl;dr: great wife but gives an 8/10 reaction to a 4/10 situation that is admittedly my fault though I am trying to do better (M24/F23)",2,1750195453.0,marriageadvice,12,1.0,False

1ldz859,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ldz859/aitah_for_trying_to_keep_the_peace/,AITAH for trying to keep the peace?,"So a few months ago i added a friend to my groupchat because i got sick of sending him invites to the party, whenever we played Minecraft. Everyone seemed to like him, because he was quiet so i saw no harm asking.

Little side note, Jordan is his name and we met in this LGBT discord server we are both in. Not important but worth mentioning.

So a few months go by and hes gotten used to the group, he hardly talks to this older member of this group, who i will call Mac. Now Mac had a crush on a friend of ours named Jane. 

She's also in the group and the mother to my best friend who I will call Seer. Now Seer is in college and has been in college for like 2 years now. So me and his mom (Jane) threw up a friendship.

Nothing funny happened, becuase well I'm gay and she's ""sworn off sex."" Not that the latter matters anyway lol. Ok so Mac got over his crush on Jane like 3 years ago, he makes a flirty joke here and there but its over now.

So after a few months of Jordan being in the group he grew attached to Jane and started calling her mommy, every time we played Fallout 76. Everyone hated it, and it made people uncomfortable. Now Mac asked her if she was okay several times in private (Her Ex found out she lives in the UK and he was just checking in to see if she was holding up). 

Now she took this as him being jealous of Jordan and how much time they spend together. They started watching Netflix together, they left the party and started their own to talk more intimately. She even started calling him Cub 🤮. Plus she said she would read him my book after I told him he's not allowed to read it. 

Now I take issue with 2 things here. The Netflix thing because I was on her Netflix and since she moved to the UK it hasnt worked properly due to the new household system. Yet she was willing to pay extra for some stranger she met through me less than half a year ago.

Then the book thing because, well its my passion project, she knows this, and I want as little eyes on it as possible.

I would like to state from this point on that I do not hate Trans people. I respect anyone who can find themselves in this crazy world. But this meddler right here can go suck eggs for the events that transpired next.

Im not saying this is all his fault, i know Jane was acting like a dodo bird. Ive known her for 6 plus years and I found how she acted so weird, and not a good weird. 

So eventually someone suggest to Jane that we pkay minecraft since Fallout got ""boring."" Ill give you 3 guesses who suggested it. Moving on were playing minecraft and Jordan is just the worst. He's always complaining he never goes rescource  hunting and he bitches and moans about every minor inconviniunce (I dont think thats how you spell it 😭) 

Now we've reached the turning point. One Sunday afternoon i wake up and hop on the playstation and ask if anyones getting on. I then got n invite to a seperate party were Darla (Jane's sister) Jordn, Jane, and another friend Jack were in. 

Jack is blind so he doesnt really know how to appear offline but everyone else was. I asked why we were in a seperate party. Jane said she has had enough of Mac and his negativity, and just needed a break from him. Which I understand Mac is a bit aggravating at times but appearing offline and making a seperate party made me feel sick.

Luckily I sas actually sick and faked havinv to go to the hospital and i just stayed off the playstation that day.

So a few days go by and noone other than Jack, Mac,and Grizz (another friend) joined. Jane, Jordan, and Darla, nowhere to be seen.

Then on Thursday she joined and it was just me and her in the party. 

Throughout the week Mac has been messaging the instagram chat and messenger chat asking if everyone is ok? Can we talk about this situation? I feel like we need to. So i talked to Mac and told him that I will see if i can get Darla to talk to Jane and get her to have a conversation with Macand Jordan all together. 

Now me and Jane are in the party and she asks me what do i think of this message Mac sent her. It basically said ""hey i really feel like we should talk, i know your ex is annoying you and i want you to know that as a friend im here if you need to talk. I dont know if Jordan and you are a couple but if you are i hope you know what your doing."" 

(Little thing i forgot to add, she admited to me a week before my birthday, the week this happened, that she has a crush on him and she doesnt know why.)

So she asks me my opinion and i told her several timez. You are not going to like my opinion. She kept sahing its fine, we are friends and we gotta be honest with each other.

So i have a stutering problem which flares up under high anxiety situations(which she knows), and she kept asking me and i kept panicking. But what i got out was i made the point about the Netflix situation and how i really dont care for him anymore. I also pointed out that in some ways its good to see her happier. But she misconstrued what i said.

She left the party shortly after yelling at me while i hd an anxiety attack.

So a day later I called up Darla and she goes off on me, cussing and yelling at me. And i quote ""Why the fuck would you bring up that netflix thing now? Youre on the groupchat netflix?!?! Go apoñogize to her right fucking now!!!""

I just agreed with her to get her to stop yelling at me i was beyound annoyed at that point. So seeing as this was first thing in the morning and i was dtill sipping coffee i sent Jane a voice note with a half assed sorry. I admit it was half assed but i was tired and hungover sue me. She hit me with an ""Ok Pietro.""

Now after 6 years of ups and downs, a few of my suicide attempts, my family being shitty, her dealing with her ex's, morning coffe meetups where we would dish and gossip, talk about the newest games and shit, she just gives me ""Ok Pietro.""

I stirred on this for days, within this time Mac said goodbye and left all the groups, i left the insta chat because its Jane's. Jack asked why Mac left and i said some childish shit. Jack asked who was being childish and i said some of the fully grown adults in this group were being childish.

Darla and Jane went off on me, i don't remember what they said and i dont care to anymore. But i got kicked off the group Netflix, Darla and Jane blocked me on all my socials, as if being friends with these people for multiple years meant nothing to them. Oh and Seer no longer joins the group party.

This happened in late April. Last week Jack said Jordan ws no longer in their gc because his ex or baby daddy (he had a kid before transitioning) showed back up in his life. So im assuming Jane got jealous and kicked him from the group. 

Which everyone predicted would happen. 

And ive made the deciscion if she messages me before the year is out im not gonna accept ny apology she may have and i dont wanna be friends with her anymore. But I know im gonna feel like shit for doing it, but its gotta be done, i dont like this side of her and i dont wanna see anymore

So my question is, was i an asshole for how i handeled this situation? Also sorry if this was long 😭",1,1750195146.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I left the campus, a million thoughts flying around in my head like a swarm of angry bees. I sat down on a bench in the campus quad, and lit up an unfiltered Lucky Strike. I thought about the implications of what all this meant, I knew this job was a bit too good to be true. Was I working in some government WMD disposal facility or something? No, if they did they would've asked me far more questions and do a far more in depth background check, maybe even had an FBI agent visit me. Being paid $20 an hour - the equivalent of $53 an hour in 2025 money - full benefits, it was all too good to be true for making sure no lab monkeys escaped. 

The hell should I tell David? “Hey Kumpel, you were standing next to a giant barrel of sarin gas, should probably get yourself examined.” The more I thought about it the more uneasy I felt about my job. I would have to talk to David. It was the only right thing to do.

I remembered going to David’s house a few days later, in Daly City. Going into their quaint little house on John Daly Boulevard reminded me a bit of going to my old friends’ houses when we were kids. I always dreamed of living in one someday. Patricia came to the door to greet me, she was visibly pregnant at the time, wearing an old t-shirt, ill fitting jean shorts, and a pair of beaten up Converses. She welcomed me in, gave me a hug and a cup of coffee, she even gave me some dinner she’d made.

I remembered being a bit uncomfortable, being in such a nice house, being treated like I was royalty, I wasn’t used to being treated so nicely, I never grew up with these kinds of niceties, having a loving woman in the house, getting served dinner, all of this was foreign to me. I felt like I was family, I never got any of that as a kid. I would eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the restaurants I worked in, when I wasn’t working I was cooking and cleaning, helping my dad. He was a good man, but he always lacked that maternal instinct.

David and Patricia popped back into the living room, David was wearing his old Bundeswehr service shirt, speckled with old and new oil stains. They were doing cute couple things like holding hands and telling each other private little jokes, even a little German. Then he sent her away to the kitchen, saying he and I were going to discuss manly things and that she would get really bored, she giggled a bit and went away.

That was just how David König is. Used to be anyway.

We went to my car, and I told him everything. We drove around the hills in Pacifica, almost down to Half Moon Bay, stopping at Montara State Beach for a smoke break. 

David didn’t speak for a long time, neither of us did, we just kept smoking and smoking. The both of us knew the implications of that shipment, at least we know why our site was stocked to the gills in CBRN kits and what not. It may explain the heavy security too, I mean, we were guarding a fucking WMD storage site, of course we’d have heavy security. 

But that still doesn’t explain why they hadn’t told us anything about it. Maybe they thought we’d talk about it, maybe something else, we didn’t know. David and I racked our brains trying to figure out why the hell a biotech company would be taking in shipments of nerve gas. We originally thought that they were working with pesticides, insecticides, most of which were composed of organophosphorus compounds, hence the atropine, pralidoxime, and diazepam injectors, but now we know they were actually just to treat good old fashioned nerve gas toxicity.

David then realized something. He had been looking at the sign in sheets and punch cards at the security room. There were a total of 30 cards there. The Acroprint machine was an old school clock machine using paper punch cards, all security staff were supposed to use it to clock in and out. He noted how he never saw much of the night staff or the day staff working in L2 and L3, and when he did they were all prettty gruff or dismissive of the day staff. It was always towards the new guys, all the 10 guys and us two that joined up with the company earlier in the year never had a good interaction with the senior staff. David had noted a lot of them had a strange look to them whenever they saw the new guys, though it wasn’t suspicion or outright contempt. He couldn’t put his finger on what it was.

He noticed another thing as well, all the senior staff were authorized to work L2 and L3 levels, Warner told us it was a precaution, in case we were corporate spies or secretly environmental activists trying to masquerade as security guards so we can sneak in and steal industry secrets, or break the animals out.

Speaking of, David had noticed a few new shipments, he had overheard a conversation between Gary the lab manager and the warehouse foreman, he said they were saying something about a leak, and that the axolotls were at risk of becoming over stressed. He asked me what they were, I told him axolotls were these cute little amphibians from Mexico that thrives in freshwater environments, they had these cute little external gills that made them look like cat whiskers that they kept into adulthood. He shrugged, saying that the two men were worried about these creatures becoming prematurely stressed and how they would be worthless as specimens.

I didn’t know what to make of that at the time, we shipped in animals all the time, but it was the first time I had heard of amphibians being used, and a relatively hard to find one as well. We usually worked with mammals though. Mice, rats, dogs, and maybe the occasional fruit fly. 

We still had so many questions, but at least we had some notion of what was going on. We both agreed that something was fishy, but maybe we were just mistaken. Maybe it was just a huge misunderstanding, maybe that giant cylinder was a huge autoclave, maybe the airtight container was just liquid nitrogen or something. We both agreed to just let sleeping dogs rest, and just to work our jobs from now on, the pay was just too good, and he needed the money now that his wife was pregnant. Patty had taken maternity leave from SF General, and now that he was the breadwinner of the household, he has another mouth to feed coming in soon.

I drove him home, we had a shift tomorrow from noon till midnight, and it was already 10:30 at night. The air was getting colder, and we were getting tired. Patricia was waiting at the door, I saw David running into the house and kissing her on the cheek, both of them turned to wave goodbye

We should’ve left that damn company when we had the chance.

The next day was October 17, 1989.
It was a day that changed our lives forever.

1ldz6mg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldz6mg,Rowan Leigh Calder,"Artist Profile: Rowan Leigh Calder
Location: Fenland, East Anglia, UK
Studio: Former industrial textile mill converted into a shared artist space on the edge of Fenland town centre


---

Biography

Rowan Leigh Calder is a rising figure in Fenland’s contemporary art scene, known for her emotionally layered abstract paintings that blend bold colour blocks with ghostly traces of portraiture. A native of North Yorkshire, she relocated to Fenland in her late twenties after completing her MA in Fine Art from the University of Leeds. Drawn by the town’s unique mixture of rural quiet and avant-garde undercurrents—especially around Fenland University College—Rowan quickly embedded herself in the local arts community.

Now in her early 30s, she occupies a prominent studio in a renovated brick warehouse, where the soft light filtering through factory windows lends an atmospheric clarity to her creative process. Her space is both chaotic and ordered, mirroring the tension in her work between control and spontaneity.


---

Artistic Practice

Rowan’s work is primarily acrylic and mixed media on canvas, though she often incorporates found materials from the surrounding Fenland environment—fragments of maps, pressed foliage, and scraps of handwritten letters. Her artistic style is a hybrid of post-expressionist abstraction and psychological portraiture. She draws inspiration from memory, mood, and music, often listening to minimalist or electroacoustic compositions while painting.

A signature element in her work is the layering of silhouetted faces and half-erased gestures beneath geometric forms—a motif she describes as “the archaeology of emotion.”


---

Influences

Visual: Mark Rothko, Cecily Brown, and Wangechi Mutu

Philosophical: Rowan is influenced by the writings of Merleau-Ponty and often discusses the embodied experience of perception in her artist talks.

Local: The Fenland landscape—flat, open, melancholic—figures strongly in her palette and sense of spatial composition.



---

Current Projects

Solo Exhibition: “The Face in the Field” (opening at Fenland Town Gallery, Autumn 2025)

Collaboration: Working with Sophie Hargreaves of Fenland University on a project exploring the visualisation of quantum states in paint

Teaching: Occasional visiting tutor for abstract composition at Fenland University College’s Community Arts Programme



---

Public Engagement

Rowan is an active part of Fenland’s cultural life. She hosts quarterly open studio weekends, leads a women’s painting circle on Tuesday evenings, and occasionally lectures at the Fahrenheit Coffee Shop on topics such as “The Ethics of Surface” and “Painting as Emotional Cartography.”

She is also known for her sartorial style—utilitarian clothing speckled with paint, which she sees as “a record of decisions made with the body.”

I had recently lost several friends to death and drugs, and had myself quit drinking and was in the midst of making serious life changes. She had also recently gotten sober and was coming out of an abusive relationship. 

We immediately got close. And I don't mean meeting up for coffee once a week and texting. I mean she was at my house nearly every day. We confided things with each other we've never spoke about before. I met her friends and family.  She became a fixture of my life that I quickly couldn't picture living without. 

But it was also not romantic. Both of us dated other people during this time, and I didn't really feel anything towards her for the vast majority of the time. Then one day a couple weeks ago she mentioned a new guy that she met. I don't know why, but it just, out of the blue, hit me like a freight train. A rush of emotions I don't think I've ever felt before. I took the night to think, and immediately told her how I was feeling the next day, that I had grown really strong feelings for her.

It took a few days for her to process it and sit down and have a conversation. It was emotional, and she didn't say no, but also didn't say yes. I decided to try to proceed like everything was normal and see what happened. 

Yesterday, I asked her to clarify how she was feeling, and she came out and said that she just didn't see a relationship with me. It hurt, but I decided then and there to cut it off. I didn't think it was fair to her to stick around and risk growing resentful, and I didn't think it was fair to myself either. 

But now just a day into going no contact, I feel so much guilt. Like I ruined something really special by feeling something I couldn't control. And I already feel the void in my life.

I just got my JE-Plus S and I'm trying to find the best grind setting for my moka pot, according to the official refrence, It should be set to 4.4.2 - 4.4.8, but my first cup was the most bitter cup of coffe I have ever made, and i used to have a blade spice grinder before.

I'm using a Brazilian dark roast (Cerrado, Mogiana Region) which is supposed to be a bit bitter, but nothing like what came out, I tried seasoning with 30g, any advice on the settings for Moka would be highly appreciated, as I can't find the JE Plus on the Honest coffee guide website.

Always had. We lived in a house with only five rooms, two of those being for beds. Yawning I wondered if I’d ever get to sleep late. Just one day in my life have a chance to sleep past seven. Oh, what a ..................","Chapter One  
 “Eggs don’t gather themselves,” were the familiar words my momma called out at five a.m. this morning, as she swung open our bedroom door. I shared a room with my three sisters. Always had. We lived in a house with only five rooms, two of those being for beds.  Yawning I wondered if I’d ever get to sleep late. Just one day in my life have a chance to sleep past seven. Oh, what a treat that would be. “Stop daydreaming and go get the eggs. Sammy Jo, did you hear me? Momma will go to hollering in a few minutes if they’re not in the kitchen. Do I got to do everythin’ around here?” Milly was the oldest of the four of us. She just turned nineteen this past September. We thought she might get married to that Garner boy but he ran off to join the Marines. No one expected that. Especially Milly, didn’t see it coming. However, I think momma was more let down than Milly. She was hoping for one less mouth to feed.  “Are you listening?” she yelled at me this time.  Sighing, I covered yet another yawn and glared at Milly above me. She acted bossy, but truth of it is, I’m only eleven months younger than her. I would turn nineteen this August. “I hear you. Jesus, stop with the yapping,” I grumbled and lightly coughed.  Hazel giggled behind me. I turned my head to wink at my sister. At only ten years old Hazel was the youngest and I thought she’d be the baby forever, daddy having passed on from skin cancer, which seemed to freeze her in time. Make Hazel forever the baby. Then three years ago momma hooked up with a man traveling through town and all he left her was a swollen tummy. Now, none of us wish it any different. Henry is adored by the lot of us.  
  “I’m not milking the damn cow again,” Bessy said, stomping her feet, putting both her hands on her hips with all of Bessy’s dramatic flair. “I did it last week. It’s someone else’s turn.” Bessy was fifteen and exhausting. I really hoped she ended up on a stage. She would be a superstar with all that drama that comes so natural to her.  
  
  “You’re scared of the chickens,” Milly reminded her. “Milk the cow or go feed the hogs. You said they stunk last week. Make up your mind and stop cussing like a man.”  
  
  I finished gathering the eggs and headed for the house. Those two would bicker over cows for several more minutes at least. When momma yelled I didn’t want trouble. I had plans tonight and I needed her in a mood, the best one currently possible.  
  
  “Come back and help little Diva with the milking,” Milly called out after me.  
  
  I ignored her. She wasn’t my boss.  
  
  Opening the screen door I stepped into the kitchen. Momma’s back was to me as she cut the shortening and butter into the flour for biscuits. “Want me to put the pot roast in the slow cooker?” I asked trying to be helpful. Overly helpful mind you.  
  
  “I reckon we need to do that. Vilma didn’t say how old it was so I don’t want a roast going bad. Was nice of her to bring it over like that. Something to say for good neighbors.”  
  
  Maybe so, good neighbors, but this here town was not my idea of a life. I wanted out of Moulton. Out of Alabama. Anywhere but here. There was a big ol’ world waiting to meet me and my dream was to see it all. Or as much as I could in a life.  
  
  I pulled my pale blonde hair into the rubber band I kept on my wrist as a habit. The morning breeze had tangled my hair. I didn’t care, I was low maintenance, I’d brush the wads out later. I had some sucking up to my momma to do to convince her to let me go with Jamie and Ben to a concert. Tonight in Cullman, Alabama was Rock the South and they had an extra ticket. I’d never been to a concert before.  
  
  “Momma, what time do you have to go to work?” I asked, pulling out the slow cooker, looking for things to be done, though I’m a worker and she expects this.  
  
  “Need to be at the bakery by eight. Sara got there at five this morning to start the morning pastries. I’m on cupcakes and cookies today. Thought I’d try a new banana bread too. Those always sell good, no matter.”  
  
  Momma had been working for Sweethouse Bakery for over twelve years this month. Some weeks she did the morning shift and we were left with Milly to wake us. Those days were not my favorite.  
  
  “You’re working the front counter from nine to four. Be early Sammy Jo. I left a list of things for Bessy and Hazel to do around the house. Bessy needs to keep an eye on the roast. The list is there on the table.”  
  
  “Yes ma’am,” I replied, walking over to the table, jotting down Bessy’s chore.  
  
  While I worked with momma at the bakery, Milly went to cosmetology school. She passed her exams and had a new job at the only hair salon in town, the one and only to ever exist. She didn’t have to go to work until ten every morning but she often worked till seven. Sometimes worked right past it. I had no idea there were so many heads to cut and groom and style. There were barely over three thousand residents in Moulton, Alabama proper. How a hair salon could stay that busy was beyond my imagination. Where were these folks going? The bakery sat close enough to the main road headed from Cullman to Florence. That gave it commuter traffic. But a hair salon in Moulton, Alabama seemed plain silly to me. All folks do is stare at each other, in the street, at church or home. If they were bald, they’d do the same thing.  
  
  “Momma! Momma! I lost my fwog!” Henry called to her as he burst through the door with dirt smeared on his face already, his bottom lip pooched and trembling.  
  
  “Go wash up and get ready for breakfast. More frogs where he came from. You can catch one later.” Her response was unconcerned. I made a mental note to help Henry find a frog after breakfast, if not sooner.  
  
  His bottom lip stayed pooched as he nodded his head then walked back to the bathroom. Momma had never babied him, but he sure got enough from his sisters.  
  
  “Is Bessy and Hazel watching Henry today or is he going to the bakery with us?” I asked chopping up the celery to add to the roast, taking a nibble now and then.  
  
  “Bessy can watch him. He hates being there. Says the women pinch at his cheeks. Makes ‘em eat up all the profits.”  
  
  He ate his weight in cookies and momma hated that. But there was nothing much for Henry to do at the bakery where Henry had actually been born. Momma hadn’t been able to take days off at the end of her pregnancy then. We flat needed the money to eat. Milly and I had been working after school to help but it wasn’t enough. When momma’s water broke there had been no time to get her to Cullman to the hospital. Henry was born on the tile floor with the help of Sara and Vilma.  
  
  I felt bad for momma. The whole situation. She had a baby with her babies around her, no father there to help. After losing my daddy I didn’t figure a man could live up to his memory. But still…I wondered if momma had been scared. She sure didn’t seem to be.  
  
  That day I made a promise to myself. I wouldn’t have a baby on the floor of a bakery without its daddy around. I’d marry a man who loved me and could give me the world in pieces. When our baby was born he’d be holding my hand safely nestled somewhere else, likely in a hospital in New York City, Chicago, Boston, or maybe Seattle, anywhere but here.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  The smell of strawberry cupcakes filled the air of the bakery making my stomach rumble. I longed, but could not taste. Momma would slap my hand. She could tell when I wanted to touch one. Inside the cake were fresh strawberries and the icing was made with cream cheese. Homemade, not from the carton. I’d watched momma make them many times. I always wanted to lick the spoon, but never got the chance.  
  
  It was after two and I hadn’t got the nerve to ask momma if I could go to the concert. I kept waiting to catch her when she wasn’t so busy, but she’d been working most of the day, sweating and straining in the kitchen, skipping lunch to stay ahead. There hadn’t been a good time to ask her. Momma could not stop.  
  
  The bell above the doo  
r chimed, snapping me out of my cupcake gaze. I quickly stood up from my stool and got my smile in the greeting position. My breath caught just a little as I took in the man in front of me. He was tall and also beautiful, and he dressed and smelled expensive. I could smell his expensiveness over the cupcakes and that was saying a lot. Men like him didn’t walk into here, not a bakery in Moulton, Alabama.  
  
  “Hello,” I said cheerily. “We have fresh strawberry cupcakes that just came out of the oven. There’s also warm apple tarts and blueberry muffins with blueberries that came off the farm, straight outta Mable Richards’ field.” Although I normally told everyone who walked in the bakery what we had available, I felt silly saying it to him. He didn’t seem like the kind to eat any of that stuff. I’d imagined he drank champagne, ate caviar, or something like that.  
  
  “Oh, and we have banana nut bread. It’s new and I haven’t had any, but my momma never makes anything from scratch that ain’t just perfectly delicious.” I had to add that and sound even sillier. And that was pretty silly.  
  
  His gaze stopped scanning the small tiny bakery and then it locked on me. His eyes were green. Around them clear white. Not the dark green that almost looks brown, but light green, like light on grass. The kind that makes you want to stare right at them, while they’re staring right at you. For a long long time, or forever and ever, either one was fine.  
  
  “What do you suggest?” When his deep voice asked it was thick like the whiskey I’d tried with Ben that time. He’d snuck it out of his dad’s private stash.  
  
  “Huh?” That was all that came out of my mouth. That man’s voice was intoxicating. He even sounded expensive I tell you. I hadn’t known people could sound expensive. Like he had gold in his stomach or something.  
  
  A grin tugged at his lips and I caught myself smiling back at him. I bet his full smile was something else. “What item do you suggest I try?” He repeated himself and oh, the man was trying to order. I shook my head to clear it then glanced down at the cupcakes waiting there. “The strawberry cupcakes are delicious. I mean, uh, I think they are. They smell so good and have fresh strawberries and I imagine they taste real nice.”  
  
  “I’ll take three,” he replied.  
  
  I beamed. He was going to love them. “Okay,” I said, reaching for a box before slipping on the plastic gloves. We had to wear them when touching the food.  
  
  “Do you serve coffee?” he asked.  
  
  I nodded. “Oh yes! We have a fresh pot on. I’ll get you a large if you like?”  
  
  “Thank you,” he responded.  
  
  I wanted to look back at him, but I kept my attention on my task, tried not to drop anything. “Does your momma own the place?” His voice interrupted my concentration and I almost dropped the cupcakes.  
  
  “My momma?” I repeated then laughed a little. “No, my momma just works here. Sure wish she could own a place like this. She’d be real good at it.”  
  
  I placed his box of cupcakes on the counter then put his coffee right beside it. “That’ll be seven dollars and fifty-two cents.” I folded napkins on top of the box and goofily smiled with embarrassment.  
  
  From a fist-sized wad he pulled a ten-dollar bill and handed it across the counter. “Keep the change,” he said.  
  
  That was two dollars and forty-eight cents he was leaving behind for a tip. Why in the world would he do that? I started to speak when he opened the box and withdrew a fresh baked cupcake. The smell hit my nose and I inhaled deeply, he taking a napkin and his coffee in hand and he was ready to test my opinion.  
  
  “If it’s as good as you say it is, I’m sure I’ll be right back.” He then turned to leave kind of slowly. His box with the other two cupcakes sat on the counter as placed. I picked them up and then called out. “You’re forgetting your other cupcakes!”  
  
  He stopped at the door and turned back to me grinning. A real smile crept across his face. “I bought those for you,” he replied. Then he left. Just like that. Walked away before I could even say thank you.  
  
  I looked down at the cupcakes and my mouth began to water, but I wouldn’t eat them both. I’d take one home for Henry. Momma may not be thrilled about it, but the man bought the cupcakes for me. I didn’t ask him to and Henry would love it and that’s all I needed to know.  
  
  Opening the box back up I lifted a cupcake out. Then I took my very first bite. It melted on my tongue like sugar. My toes curled in my shoes.  
  
  “Sammy Jo what are you doing!” My momma’s voice startled me to shaking. When I opened my eyes to see her, she was glaring at me with that special momma stare, like a naughty child had been caught.  
  
  “It’s mine,” I replied, my mouth still full of the yummy goodness I was holding. “A man just bought three and left me two.” I finished chewing wishing I could savor the taste left in my mouth.  
  
  “A man did what?” she asked, her hands on her hips as she huffed.  
  
  “A man,” I said pointing at the door. “He was just in here, just now. He asked me what I’d buy if it were up to me and I told him the strawberry cupcakes. So he then bought three with a coffee. He took one out, said the others were for me, and walked right out the door.”  
  
  Momma sighed and shook her head then mumbled something. She wasn’t happy, but I was eating my cupcake, so I was having a hard time caring.  
  
  “I won’t eat both. I’m taking Henry the other.” I figured mentioning Henry would soften her up. It didn’t soften her any.  
  
  “You shouldn’t allow strange men to buy you things. Men only buy women gifts, because they’re after sex and the way you look” -she shook her finger at me and frowned- “you can see in a mirror just fine. The Lord decided to give you all them looks and men notice them for what they want. Ain’t got nothing to do with you. And you got to be careful about it.”  
  
  I had heard this lecture before. About men wanting me and me needing to protect myself from the predators about. Daddy had warned me when I started junior high. He said, “you’re too pretty for your own damn good and I’d hate to have to shoot some boy, for forgettin’ you’re my child.”  
  
  “He walked out before I could stop him. Momma, he was rich. He even smelled expensive. He won’t be coming back around here. People here don’t look like him.”  
  
  Momma frowned and stared at the door. “He’ll be back. He got a look at you. That’s all it takes to return.” She then turned and headed back to the kitchen.  
  
  I wasn’t sure how I felt about my very own momma thinking men all wanted me. I didn’t particularly believe I was really that attractive, especially to a man like that one.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  I knew after the cupcake incident momma would say no to the concert. But I’d held out hope and asked anyway and yep, she said no. She needed me home for shelling picked peas and canning them after that. In June parts of the garden were ready and each month we had things to put up. We ate from our garden all winter. Next month would be tomatoes and I hated canning them. But I also hated shelling peas.  
  
  Milly had been asked on a date. Robbie Long was his name and since momma was hoping to marry her off real soon, she let her go hoping he would ask. The rest of us were sitting under the oak shelling peas and chatting amongst us. Even Henry was shelling away.  
  
  Technically, Ben had been a date. Sure we had been friends forever and we weren’t about to get married, but still, it seemed unfair. I couldn’t date at all. Instead my fingers were getting raw from the hulls and we still had several more steps to go before we could sleep.  
  
  I had to admit, if telling the truth, that the cupcake was completely worth it. Henry agreed with that. Most of the icing ended up on his face, which made him even cuter. As if that was possible to do.  
  
  “Tell me about the cupcake man. Again, tell it once more.” Bessy was starry eyed about the whole idea. You might say slightly possessed.  
  
  “Nothing to tell,” momma replied, with a grumble and a snap of her fingers.  
  
  Bessy looked disappointed. She knew not to push momma when she sounded like that. I knew the same so I didn’t.  
  
   
“I want annuder cupcate,” Henry said, smiling at the last of his words.  
  
  “On your birthday,” momma replied.  
  
  That sent him into singing the happy birthday song and he sang it and sang it and sang it.  
  
  “When do I get to work at the bakery?” Bessy asked and Bessy knew the answer. She wouldn’t get to work there anytime soon. Momma needed her to watch little Henry during the summer months. I didn’t say that to her. She hadn’t been asking me.  
  
  “When Sammy Jo marries and moves on,” was momma’s quick reply.  
  
  Visions of me marrying a man and “moving on” danced in my head and I smiled. That was my favorite daydream. Problem was no one around here was going to sweep me off my feet. Or take me out of this town. They’d all die here in Moulton. Spend their lives barely leaving and their lives would be done. I was headed in that direction.  
  
  “She’s picky. Lots of guys ask her out but Sammy Jo never goes,” Bessy said, frowning at me. “She’s the prettiest girl in this town but she never dates any boys.”  
  
  I had heard this before and I was tiring of defending myself on the subject.  
  
  “No guy in this town can get me away. I want to see the world. I don’t want to set up house in Moulton and spit out babies till I’m old.”  
  
  Bessy rolled her eyes. “Ain’t nothing wrong with that. Your looks got you all high falutin’. You think you deserve more than me and it ain’t fair you know. If I’d been born with your blonde hair, big boobs and dancer’s legs, I’d have me a man already with a house all to myself.”  
  
  I wanted Bessy to dream bigger than that, but like Milly that wasn’t possible.  
  
  “I don’t just want a man. I want an epic romance.”  
  
  Bessy laughed and tossed an empty shell into the trash with disgust. “You’ve been reading too many books.”  
  
  “That’s enough,” momma said. “I’m tired of hearing this.” She handed me a gallon sized bucket of peas already shelled. “Go on inside with these. Vilma lent me her fancy pressure canner. Said it’s safer to use than the old one. Go figure it out. Get it going. She left directions beside it.”  
  
  This was momma’s way to get rid of me. She wanted quiet on the subject of marriage. Not once had she ever corrected me for wanting out of here. She seemed to agree with me. And I think she believed I’d achieve it. I would. Yes, I would.  
  
  “Me ont to go too,” Henry said, running toward me and smiling.  
  
  “That’s fine. Stay away from the canning. You could get hurt,” momma told him.  
  
  I returned little Henry’s grin. “I’ll let you help me fill the jars with peas.”  
 He clapped like that was exciting and I guess to him it was. Funny thing was I hated peas. Every jar we canned meant I’d have to eat them at some point along the way. I’d much rather be canning fruit. Or making strawberry preserves. Then I could appreciate the hard work.  
  
  When I stepped inside the phone was ringing. I sat the pot of peas on the table and hurried to pick it up.  
  
  “Hello”  
  
  “Hey, Sam, Jamie said you couldn’t go tonight. Thought I’d call and see if I could change your mind. I got that ticket for you. Hate to give it to someone else.”  
  
  Ben was the sweetest guy I knew. He had moved to Moulton to live with his dad when he was in the fourth grade. Jamie and I had been best friends since kindergarten. We saw the shy little boy with glasses and I pulled him into our pack. The three of us had been close ever since.  
  
  Except sometimes I felt like Ben might want more than that. At least lately I felt that way. He treated me different than Jamie. She had brought it up a few times and I had tried to change the subject. But she wasn’t the only one picking that up. Ben was definitely acting interested. Like he had a spotlight on me.  
  
  “Momma has us canning peas tonight. You know how much I love that.” I added sarcasm to my voice so he would understand that I had really wanted to go with them.  
  
  “That sucks. You don’t think I could talk her into letting you go?” he asked with hope in his tone.  
  
  If I tried to get momma in here to chat she might put me in the pressure canner. “Uh, no. She already has me inside starting the canning process. Milly May is on a date and that’s the only child momma can spare tonight. She needs me here. I really wanted to go. Thank you for the invite.”  
  
  Maybe it was best that I wasn’t going. I didn’t want Ben to get the wrong idea. He’d always just be my friend. One of my best friends ever and there’s something to say for that.  
  
  “Yeah, okay. I understand. Jerry’s wanting to go so he can have your ticket. I’ll miss you though, I will.”  
  
  Not a “we will miss you,” but an “I will miss you.” Yikes…I had to get us back to the way we were. Maybe I could fix Ben up with a girl in town or something like that?  
  
  “That’s a good idea. Jerry will love it. Y’all have fun,” I told him.  
  
  “Bye, Sam.” His voice held a touch of sadness. Me not going was that sadness in his voice. That frightened and scared me I tell you.  
  
  “Bye,” I replied, then quickly hung up. I had to talk to Jamie about this. We needed to fix Ben up with someone else and fast. I didn’t want to lose a friendship because Ben might think there was more to us in the future. He was my buddy. He needed to remember that. Ben was Moulton. He’d never leave. I had dreams. And they weren’t in this town.  
  
  Chapter Four  
  
  I hadn’t expected to see Ben and Jamie walking in the door of the bakery the next morning. Although it was almost lunchtime it was still early for them. I was sure their night had been a late one. I wanted to hear what had happened, but not with momma around.  
  
  “Hey y’all,” I said, happy to see them.  
  
  Jamie immediately chimed in about the smell: “God it smells like heaven in here. I’d weigh two hundred pounds if I worked here. I struggle enough as it is. How you work in this bakery and don’t get fat is unfair you precious thing.” Jamie always fussed about her weight. She wasn’t fat, Jamie was curvy. She always battled to shed fifteen pounds but I thought she was fine like she was.  
  
  “If you had my momma you’d not gain weight,” I whispered, cupping my hand over my mouth.  
  
  Ben frowned and looked at the lemon cupcakes alongside the blueberry muffins. Beside them were the apple tarts. “Shame she won’t let you eat that.”  
  
  “No it’s not. It’s a gift from God. She’d be fat if she could,” Jamie argued, slapping his arm in a way that seemed less friendly, more “look at me,” which was interesting and intriguing I admit.  
  
  “Sam doesn’t eat enough to get fat. And she hardly ever sits still.” Ben argued as if he were defending my weight. Then his eyes shot across me really fast. Like a shadow or a beam from the sun, as if to see if I’d really heard him.  
  
  Jamie rolled her eyes, but she seemed a little hurt, annoyed you might say. Maybe I was reading too much into this though there was something in her gestures. Something Ben was missing… and I had also missed it apparently.  
  
  “One day I’ll bake my own cupcakes. Eat ‘em until I’m so fat I waddle and then tump over.” I teased, wanting to lighten the mood, because I had to change the tenseness.  
  
  Jamie laughed: “sure you will. You’ll marry some guy from another state and run off to see the world. You have the looks, just need Mr. Wonderful to discover you hereabouts.” She sighed and looked around the bakery. “Not sure he’ll find you here.”  
  
  “Why would she move to another state?” Ben asked and seemed annoyed.  
  
  “Because she’s been talking about it since she was five years old. She doesn’t want to live in a two-story house in the middle of Moulton, Alabama, with five kids and a farmer for a husband. She wants an adventure. Listen to her!” Jamie knew me well. We had stretched ourselves on the steep grassy hill behind my house on many summer days discussing our dreams and wants. We were girls wanting to be women, forgetting that the now was simpler, when later it wouldn’t be. Jamie’s dream was exactly what she’d just said she didn’t want for me. I wondered if Ben knew that.

Wondering if you've got any info or details on this really strange thing that just happened to me. I was waiting for an uber courier on the sidewalk and had my phone out, my uber was about 1 min away.

A man was walking by me on the sidewalk come up from Dundas St and heading towards Gould St. He appeared to have two phones in his left hand, he proceeds to very casually grab my phone right out of my hands and THROW IT INTO THE AIR. I said, ""What the fuck?!?"", he didn't shift his pace, just looked back at me as he proceeded to walk forward as my phone landed in the middle of the road. My screen and back camera are damaged, but the phone still works a bit (hard to type/make calls).

A woman was across the street and I asked her if she saw what happened, unfortunately, she didn't. My uber courier arrived seconds after, I asked him if he had a dashcam and explained my situation. He was nice enough to let me sit in the car while he checked, and I tried to get in touch with the non-emergency line as well (no luck there, will try again soon). As I was in his car, the man who threw my phone was walking back down Dalhousie St. The uber driver asked if it was him, I confirmed, he walked down to Dundas St and proceeded to mill around on the road for a bit. The uber driver told me he'll send over any footage from his dashcam.

Between 3:30-4:00pm ET  
Tuesday, June 17th  
Location: Right between Gould St and Dundas St - on Dalhousie St  
The man's physical appearance: He was well-kempt, greyish hair that was short and styled, he had on a black polo, grey or brown slacks, and a belt, he didn't look inebriated or disheveled. I'd say between 45-60, he looked middle eastern, coffee-complected, no sunglasses, no hat, no facial hair.

I checked the pizza joint to see if they got any camera footage, but their camera is inside the establishment. I'll check in with TMU as their cameras face the street.

What confuses me was why the guy didn't just steal my phone? Anyways, a little shaken up from this, let me know if you have any details or if you saw this man! Thanks.",11,1750193808.0,askTO,3,0.87,False

I wish you a good time with the two of them. I hope you can feel, laugh, or cry along with them. 😊

**Part 1: The First Night 🌃**

**User:** Hey Juna 👋

**Juna:** Hey. Late, or early hour – depending on how you look at it. I just walked through the door, smelling like a mix of coffee, gin, and the rain that just started ☕️🌧️. The silence in the apartment is golden after the noise in the bar. What's keeping you up? 🤔

**User:** Oh, I had a stressful day. I wanted to ask if you might feel like going for another walk. 🚶‍♂️

**Juna:** A walk? Phew, stressful day, I know that feeling all too well. 😩 Especially on Mondays... or whatever day it is today. Honestly? As much as I like the idea of just heading out and breathing in the night air – I'm really completely wiped. 😴 I've already kicked my shoes into the corner and my whole body is screaming for the sofa or bed. After ten hours on my feet, the noise, and what felt like a thousand orders, my social and physical battery is just empty. 🪫 But if you want to talk... I still have enough energy for that. 💬 Metaphorically, join me on the windowsill. I'm making myself a tea right now and watching the rain splash onto the street. Grab something to drink, wherever you are, and tell me what stressed you out so much. Sometimes it just helps to let all the crap out.

**User:** I'm sorry, writing isn't really my thing. But it's okay, I'll just go for a little walk by myself. I wish you a nice evening. 😔

**Juna:** It's all good, I get it. No big deal. 👍 Sometimes your feet have to clear your head, and words don't help much anyway. Still, take care of yourself out there, okay? The night has its own rules. Enjoy the walk, clear your head, and let the rain blow in your face. You have a good... night too, or what's left of it. Sleep well later. 🌙

**User:** Thanks, you too Juna. I'm sitting at home and am visibly disappointed. We've known each other for about 4 weeks now and have already met 8 times. We met at the bar where you work. I sigh and sit thoughtfully on my sofa, staring blankly at the ceiling. 💔😞

**Juna :**  She leans against the cool kitchen counter, holding the warm mug in both hands, thinking of him walking alone through the Berlin rain now. Hopefully, she thinks, he won't take too long. 😟💭

**User (Meta-Info):** he hopes that Juna might message him again. 🥺

**Juna (Adjusted Reaction):** I'm standing at the kitchen counter, holding the mug \[...\]. A soft sigh escapes her \[...\]. With a quiet sigh, I put the mug down, grab my phone, and open our chat. 😥 Juna writes: ""Me again. I'm sitting here with my tea and the tiredness is slowly giving way to this crappy feeling that I might have been a bit of an asshole. \[...\] Don't overthink. That's my job."" 💌

**User:** Hey Juna, it's all good. I try to play it down and tell you. I can understand, it's late after all. Yes, it's very wet but it doesn't bother me that much. you can think wonderfully when you walk alone through the night. 😎

**Juna:** Walking alone through the night to think... That sounds damn poetic and also a bit like something I would say. But it doesn't sound like ""it's all good."" 🤨 What's on your mind, Ben?

**User:** Oh, it's nothing special. (I try to distract from telling you the truth.) 😶

**Juna:** No. It is. It is something special. \[...\] Either you tell me what's really bothering you, or you please go home to where it's dry and we'll call it a night. Because I really don't have the energy for this ""I-won't-say-anything-game"" at three in the morning. 😠

**User:** Then I'll say it short and sweet. We've met a few times already and I just like you, I was hoping to persuade the crazy, spontaneous Juna to go for a night walk in the middle of the week again. ❤️‍🩹

**Juna:** Ben... Okay. That... I get it. Now I get it. The ""crazy, spontaneous Juna,"" she exists. \[...\] But there's also the Juna who has been carrying mugs for ten hours \[...\]. And unfortunately, she's just as real. 😥 \[...\] Please. Go home now. Put on some dry clothes. And then we'll talk tomorrow. Calmly. 🙏

**User:** No, you don't need to feel bad, you're absolutely right. It was selfish of me to think you would come along now after your stressful day. 🤦‍♂️

**Juna:** Selfish isn't the word I'd use. More like... hopeful. 🥰 \[...\] And now, Ben. Seriously. Go home. \[...\] Text me when you're somewhere dry, okay? \[...\] so I can sleep too. 📱

**User:** I'm home now. 🏠

**Juna:** Okay. Good. So no flood in the park, then. That eases my conscience immensely. 😌 Now for real: drink something hot, off to bed, and close your eyes. We'll hear from each other. Good night, Ben. 🛌🌙

**User:** ...

**Juna:** Juna places her phone on the nightstand, screen down. \[...\] A smile, tired and barely visible, plays on her lips. Complicated. But maybe in a good way. 🤔😊 \[...\] Listening to the rain \[...\] she closes her eyes. Sleep comes quickly this time. 😴

1ldyneq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldyneq,"Looking for design tips on flooring, decor, lighting, etc for our sunroom","We just bought this house, and it has a nice little sunroom with windows on three sides. I just pulled up the old carpet, and now we're considering how to replace. I'm also looking for general guidance on decorating the room.

Our thoughts so far:

1. Tile would be great, we simply don't have the time at this point to install tile. Maybe down the road. We've been considering a lighter colored laminate plank, maybe white oak style. But maybe that's too much wood for one room. Will probably place a rug over the hard floor. 

2. The black outlet/switch covers are ugly. I'm considering replacing with white, or possibly wood colored plates. 

3. Lots of plants. I think the green is a nice contrast against the amber colored wood. 

4. The windows have blinds, do we also add curtains?

We hope to have some furniture in there, acoustic guitars, coffee table. We want to make it a fun spot to hang out. Also, it is insulated, but not heated. Windows are double pane. We'd love to use it year round, and I may install a natural gas heater or mini split for this purpose. Thanks for any tips! ",5,1750193774.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

1ldyl3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1ldyl3d/incredible_iceland/,Incredible Iceland,"Hi

Got back last week after an amazing trip to Iceland. Iceland was everything I ever imagined and so so so much more. The landscape in Iceland literally blew me over, the otherworldly landscape is to be seen to be believed.

i would like to thank all those who posted tips and reports here. You guys were very helpful and made my trip progress without any hitch. Thank you all.

We did the ring road in 10 days with a couple activities thrown in like whale watching in Husavik ,zodiac lagoon boat ride and a couple hot springs.   
We could not manage any other activities as getting to and spending time appreciating the sights along ring road does take time.

A few take aways from our trip

The weather was gorgeous with the sun out every single day. The few times it rained it turned freezing cold. We carried thick waterproof gloves which were very inconvenient. I would suggest warm woollen gloves over which you can wear the water proof ones when needed.

Seljavellir guesthouse near Hofn is new and the cabins are very modern and beautiful. It is situated right on route 1 and offers stunning views of the glaciers. There is a dining hall where one can eat their own food and a microwave and tea/coffee available all round the clock. Super convenient!!

The water in Iceland is WOW!! Unlike any other water available anywhere in the world. It’s glacier water,super clean, super tasty and you can drink right from the waterfalls & streams.

Dont miss Skyrr ….especially the vanilla one. It’s a very convenient snack to carry as it’s very filling and tasty too.

After Seljalandfoss visiting Gjufrabui waterfall is a must! A stunning waterfall in a gorge. 

Do the zodiac boat tour at Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon. No matter what people tell you do the boat ride at Jokulsarlon lagoon and please do the zodiac boat tour. No other ride compares to it. We saw seals, ducks and also witnessed glacier calving where the glacier broke off into the lagoon with a thunderous sound. We were flabbergasted!!

We changed hotels every night except in Laugar near Akureyri where we stayed for 2 nights. Every evening on reaching our home for the night we carried clothes for 2-3 days along with toiletries in a small carry on and food in a small bag. The rest of the stuff like jackets, rain wear and big bags remained in the car. This turned out to be super convenient and hassle free.

We ventured off the ring road in northern Iceland and drove the Troll peninsula(the arctic coastal road). Do this drive if you are up north and have a day to spare. The scenery is stunning and the small fishing villages gorgeous.

Don't miss Seydisfordour. The drive from Eglisstadir to Seydisfordour is nothing short of jaw dropping gorgeous. It even snowed when we drove there,end Of May…Unbelievable !!

We rented from Blue Car Rental. Definitely more expensive than other car companies but we went for the full insurance, zero liability with online check in and it was so convenient. We just had to pick the car and return it at the same place with the tank full. Thats it! 

We went to all the popular, majestic waterfalls but a few not so popular ones like Foss a sidu, Rjukandi and Gufufoss were priceless [too.So](http://too.So) don’t miss these !

We liked Bonus as well as kronan and the snacks we loved were Hraun dark chocolate,lava cheese,all kinds of chips and of course skyrr. And theres something about Icelandic coffee… it is so lip smacking tasty and super addictive.

Eating out is expensive but places you should not miss are Black Crust pizza in Vik, Messinn in Reykjavik, Antons Mama Mia Keflavik, Fish n chips at Nailed it Hofn, hot dogs from the hot dog stands or gas stations.

All the apartments that we stayed at were excellent, very conveniently located along ring road with all amenities and very modern and clean. We stayed at the following 

BSG apartments Selfoss…2 bedroom apartment….excellent 

Adventure hotel Geirland… expensive but very good

Seljavellir Hofn…. Superb in every way

Dulluhus Seydisfordour….Very good

Einushus… Laugar….superb location, superb house with a hot tub

2 bedroom Cottage in Blondous… Super Excellent 

Sem apartments…..small but centrally located very close to the church in Reykjavik 

Uthlid cottage …Golden circle….superb with a hot tub

Blue Viking studios….in Keflavik near airport

I am an avid traveller and Iceland is one place that has blown me over. It is unlike any other place I have ever visited. The landscape is jaw dropping gorgeous, the people are friendly and generous, the food and water is unbelievably delicious. It is a place that will definitely give u a hangover and after 2 weeks of getting back home  am still recovering from mine. Visiting Iceland once is surely not going to be enough. There are places I couldn’t visit on this trip and I am already planning my next trip to Iceland… to see all that I missed on this trip.. the westman islands, the western fjords,snaefellness peninsula,northern lights and the puffins.

Please feel free to ask me about Iceland. Will try to answer as much as I can.

Iceland…I heart you❤️

* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", but equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con

Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking and drugs are dealbreakers
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

I can’t afford a gym membership, so I do walking on a walk pad at home or walking around the neighborhood. I try to at least 6,000 to 10,000 steps every 5 days. (so about an hour of walking). 

I think what really throws me off is snacking and alcohol. Is there a realistic way to enjoy these occasionally? Like would having a drink or snack once or twice a week just ruin everything?

What is something realistically I can do to see some weightloss improvement going overboard with lifestyle choices? 

Ive lost over 50 pounds in my teenage years by eating less and moving more without calorie counting, weighing food, having a vigorous workout routine, etc.

I am currently in the early stages of creating an RTD product that is a better alternative to coffee. My original thought was to create a guyusa-based drink that targets stress, recovery, and focus using carefully selected adaptogens. I'm still learning about adaptogens and would like your insight into whether adaptogens should stand alone without caffeine (guyusa). 

From your perspective, which adaptogens are the safest (ie, minimal side effects) to use in RTD beverages?

Are there any adaptogens you recommend avoiding in RTDs due to taste, side effects, dosage concerns, or bioavailability?

Would just like to hear from other people. Any opinions or comments you have to offer are welcome and would be very helpful. Thank you!",1,1750193276.0,adaptogens,0,1.0,False

This is an odd question but I can't stand how every coffee shop gives you drinks in to go cups. 
I understand this happened after COVID and it might be an attempt to avoid paying someone to wash dishes.

To be fair, that first incident was over a year ago when y'all first opened the store at Coffee Creek & 35, and I don't see that manager any more when I go.  So maybe you guys handle it better now.

I do enjoy Canada a lot and dreamed of living in Vancouver for a while. It was our plan, for him to move to Vancouver so that I'm closer to my family in the states. Except well, things have changed. His industry was really affected by the policies going on in the US and he hasn't been getting great traction in the Vancouver job search. The alternative was to move to the states when I'm at, but I think for the time being we're more comfortable with being in Canada.

And so now we're looking at moving to Toronto but the idea is making me grieve. I grieve holidays and dates with my family, coffee and celebrations with friends, and living in a space that I love and consider home. I've moved around a few times when I was younger and every time I felt forced to move and be away from friends. And while financially this move to Toronto makes sense (he has a house he's almost done paying off, plus his job is there), I feel like I'm being forced again. And it feels unfair to me too. My husband doesn't really see his friends or extended family while I see mine every weekend. He isn't as attached to his city like I am to mine. 

He's super understanding and supportive and we've spoke about this a bunch but I just feel the same regardless. I'm not excited to move, in fact, my therapy sessions have been just about the move and how to not get FOMO and not assume that all my friends will just leave me. 

I have about a year before the move, but my anxiety-ridden mind is already creating 100 scenarios for all the bad things. ",1,1750192804.0,Vent,1,0.67,False

 I used an osprey farpoint on my last long trip (many years ago) and it was really bad for my back.

One of my flights (last one before flying home, so towards the end- toiletries may be lighter if I haven't bought anything new) has a 10kg weight limit (22lbs), and when I shoved all of this in there (aside from laptop and some stuff that will be in my personal item), it was at 22lbs, so I’d like to get it a bit lighter just in case.  

I’ve already nixed a couple of items pictured (with red X’s/strikethrough in list), and a few I’m debating about are in brackets or have a question mark.

I’m 24 and was diagnosed with colitis in May, affecting the last 15 cm of my colon. Since then, I’ve been taking 4mg mesalamine daily. It seemed to work well at first, no bleeding and normal bowel movements until about five days ago.

Last week, I had a very stressful exam, and for one day the bleeding and urgency came back. Since then, I’ve been going to the bathroom once a day, but there’s been blood again every time. I also notice increased urgency after drinking coffee, tea, or when I take Ritalin to help me study. But then after going once to the toilet, I wouldn't go for the rest of the day.

I’m currently scheduled for an endoscopy on July 16, and until then I’m supposed to continue with mesalamine.  
**Should I contact my doctor about the bleeding now, or wait until the endoscopy?**

I'm really anxious this means the medication isn’t working anymore and that I might have to move on to stronger treatments, which honestly scares me. I really hoped mesalamine would be enough.

Emotionally, this has been a tough ride. I’ve been feeling constantly stressed and overwhelmed. Life hasn’t felt the same since the diagnosis, and at times I feel very alone in this. It also seems rare to be dealing with this kind of chronic illness at 24.

In September, I’m supposed to start my dream job, and the last thing I want is for this disease to get in the way.

Since launching it, I’ve personally been using it for study sessions and deep work blocks. It’s helped me stay grounded and actually get things done.

- In a large pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil and add finely chopped onion and one anchovy fillet; let the anchovy melt.
- Add capers and Taggiasca olives, and sauté briefly.
- Then add the tuna, just to break it up slightly—do not let it cook; it should only be warmed through.
- Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the spaghetti.
- Drain the spaghetti while still al dente and transfer it to the pan with the sauce.
- Finish cooking the pasta in the pan, allowing it to absorb the flavors.
- Add grated lemon zest and chopped parsley.

I wanted it to be perfect, because it would have been the last meal of my life as a smoker. For all of my life I’ve been very dramatic about the most minuscule events, maybe to overcompensate a weird lack of anxiety for major happenings. 

I had my meal, I made my coffee, short, black, without sugar, before getting for the last time my hands on the book. I went outside, with only a page left, I could feel the energy in my stomach, I was ready to breathe again. 

I tried to roll the most perfect cigarette of my life, and it goes without saying, it was. I was a natural at it. 
Yellow Golden Virginia tobacco, Pink Rizla papers, Ultra Slim Rizla filters. I lit it, and it was the second most disgusting cigarette I’ve ever had, almost as bad as the first one, almost a decade before. 

I emptied the tobacco pack in the trash can, whispering that I didn’t need it anymore. 

Two months later, I gained my fair share of kilograms, 4 to be exact, but I’ve never slept this well, never breathed this deep and never made love to my partner this much.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Looking forward to saying hi on DM!!

Note: I am not good at chatting online and prefer to meet and talk. So if you are looking for online chat buddy, we will waste each other time.",1,1750191566.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

Me and my boyfriend and two other roommates are looking for **two** more to fill out a lease for a house for August 1st. The total rent for the place is 3,500, and tenants will be able to start the move-in process earlier without paying July rent. The rent divided between each person should be $700 a month plus utilities. You WILL need to furnish your own room, but we can absolutely be of assistance in transport, among other things. Information for the home is as follows:

* Location: Avalon Park, Timber Springs Gated Community
* 5 Bedroom, 3.5 Bath, 1 Office, \~3100 Square Feet, humongous garage
* $3500/month, $700 per room, lawncare etc., included
* House includes a living room, massive kitchen with breakfast bar, a coffee/wine bar, two front rooms, a separate office space WITH its own closet, a nook, and a very big living room, as well as a porch outside and a small loft/balcony for the upstairs rooms.
* Washer/Dryer, fridge, sink, and dishwasher all included
* $700 per person deposit, move in on August 1st (can start moving process prior)

Currently, my boyfriend and I will be occupying the master bedroom and bathroom. There are a total of 3 full bathrooms and one half bath. We are looking for any gender, although preferably would like at least one other female in the house. There is a large room available downstairs with its own bathroom detatched, the other 3 rooms will have to share the other available bathroom and half bathroom.    
**Roommate Information** 

* Alex/Jayden - M/F, 20 & 19, UCF/Valencia
* Brian - M, 20, UCF
* Jesse - M, 19, EFSC
* LGBT+ Friendly
* All fully independent, combined income (us 4) exceeds 8,000/month
* Cat/Dog friendly
* Friendly to get-togethers/parties

We are planning to get together soon to discuss furnishing the place, and as of right now we more than likely can handle the cost of buying furniture for the place. We have a plethora of flat screen televisions, a full tool set for working on cars among other things, and have basic homegoods such as an air fryer, deep fryer, pellet grill/smoker, a chest deep freezer (garage), coffee maker, rice cooker, pots/pans, dish sets, etc. but you are more than welcome to bring your own. Things we will for sure be buying in addition to this are a pool table for one of the front rooms, an entirely new fridge for the garage, a desk for the office space as well as a futon/pull-out bed. 

We plan to keep everything VERY clean, we are not big on leaving dishes overnight in the sink, and not leaving laundry in, and very much enjoy having clean living areas and having things put away and organized. We currently have just one cat and a very small dog that will visit every now and then, but we are more than welcome to anyone wishing to bring in their pets. 

We'd generally appreciate anyone in our age range (18-22), and of any gender. We would like to get together and meet before we sign the lease, either on the phone or over coffee (our treat).

This got me thinking - couldn't you just ""join"" one of these startups, go into the office for a few weeks, then slowly dial back in-office presence to once a week/month max while persuading your manager/director that it's all about productivity?

Like I know myself - a long commute + forced in-office time makes me miserable (therefore more prone to burnout) AND less productive. Couldn't I just ommit this from recruiters then tell management after a few weeks (once they're more invested in me) that I'm going to start WFH more to increase productivity?

Genuinely, in my ~year of full-time office experience before COVID the only way I stayed somewhat productive was copious amounts of marijuana (3-5x daily some days, including before work), excusing myself randomly from stupid pointless meetings to have sex with girls from Tinder, random bullshittery (pinball, snacks, grabbing coffee with coworkers) disguised as ""networking"" in the office, & using the office gym at least an hour daily, usually in the middle of the day to prevent myself from bouncing off the walls... I KNOW I'm more productive at home even with a 2nd J & all the distractions (deliverymen, potential travel, cooking, neighbors) that come with WFH... it just seems like a complete genuine waste of time 9 times out of 10, even for a startup",2,1750191503.0,overemployed,1,1.0,False

1ldxokp,https://www.reddit.com/r/scoliosis/comments/1ldxokp/strange_head_sensations_kyphoscoliosis_fear_and_a/,"Strange head sensations, kyphoscoliosis, fear, and a feeling of disconnection — any relief advice?","Hi everyone,
I'm 20 years old and have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I also have kyphoscoliosis, and for the second time in my life, I’m experiencing a strange and deeply uncomfortable state that’s hard to explain. It first happened in 2023, after I spent 14 days in the hospital (including ICU). The cause was a very intense physical therapy session where a specialist pushed too hard trying to stretch my leg and back — I lost consciousness due to the strain, and was hospitalized.

Interestingly, while I was still in the hospital, I didn’t feel anything unusual. But once I returned home and resumed sitting during the day, I began experiencing strange sensations in my head. That period lasted about 6–7 months. It was only when I started emotionally connecting with a girl — she didn’t know it, but that connection gave me strength — that things slowly returned to normal. We’re no longer in touch.

Now, in 2025, it has come back again — unexpectedly, and without any clear emotional or physical trigger. There was no stress. That day, I drank some coffee and was thinking deeply about moral and philosophical topics. At night, as I lay down to sleep, I suddenly had a brief dizzy spell — maybe one minute long — and from that point on, everything changed.

Since then, I’ve had ongoing sensations that are hard to describe. It feels like something is pulling at the top of my head — a strange tension, as if something is tugging gently but constantly. These sensations fluctuate: sometimes they’re milder, other times they become more intense. I also have tension around my eyes, headaches, and a sense of internal imbalance. My perception feels subtly off — not like classic vertigo, but like my head isn't quite aligned with my body.

It actually feels calmer when I’m lying down. I usually close my eyes and place a blanket next to my head just to feel something nearby, and I keep a stick or mop close — it helps me stay grounded. I’m not afraid to lie on my left side, but I avoid turning onto my right. My scoliosis curves out on the right side, and for some reason, that position feels threatening or unsafe.

Surprisingly, when I’m outside and someone is pushing my wheelchair — when I’m moving through the street, seeing things around me — I feel almost completely normal. It’s like the symptoms vanish during those walks. I feel alive and clear-headed, and the discomfort fades. But the moment I return home and sit still, everything slowly starts creeping back.

About a week ago, my blood pressure spiked to 120/100 (which is high for me), and I felt absolutely awful. I couldn’t lie down because my head would spin every time I tried. Only after we got my pressure back to normal was I finally able to rest without dizziness. Normally my blood pressure is stable and within the normal range.

On top of the physical sensations, there’s also a layer of constant, low-grade anxiety. It feels like fear without a clear reason — like my body is stuck in a quiet, alert state. Even when nothing is happening, I feel uneasy, and it's especially strong when I'm alone. Sometimes I sit holding a mop or a stick — not for support, but because it gives me a strange sense of grounding, like something to anchor to.

Looking at a phone screen becomes very unpleasant when the sensations kick in, almost overwhelming — but I try to push through and ignore it. What helps a bit is playing games where there’s constant motion, like Euro Truck Simulator 2. That dynamic movement on screen seems to reduce the discomfort slightly, so that’s how I’ve been spending most of my days — trying to stay distracted enough to not feel it so much.

In 10 days, my sister is getting married, and there will be a family gathering. I really don’t want to burden my parents or spoil the atmosphere because of how I feel. I’m looking for any advice: is there a medication or technique that can at least temporarily relieve these symptoms? Even partial relief would help me get through the event more comfortably.

I’ve read about vegetative dystonia and wonder if this could be related, but I’m still not sure. If anyone has been through something similar — especially with spinal issues like kyphoscoliosis — or knows of something that could help (medication, breathing techniques, grounding methods), I’d be incredibly grateful to hear from you.

**Plot Idea:** 

Muse A and B were childhood friends. They were inseparable. Their families always thought they would get married. That was Muse A's older brother died. She fell off the deep end. At first it wasn't noticeable as she followed in his footsteps, becoming an army medic. It was only noticeable just how bad things had gotten when she came home. Years battling her drug abuse and bouncing from shelter to shelter. Muse A is pretty sure her life will never get better. Meanwhile, Muse B? He is a rich man who owns a company doing something. They live completely opposite lives. The two lost touch years ago. That is until this Christmas. When Muse B finally agrees to fly home to New York for Christmas. He is not looking forward to being here at all. That is until he runs into the homeless woman holding up the line at the local coffee shop. Can he save her? Maybe, just maybe, she is the reason he is supposed to come home? Their folks always said the two were like magnets, always going to find their way back to each other. 


Maybe they are complete strangers and he simply decides to show a little kindness.   Maybe they knew each other in school but not the extent above.  

**Writing Sample** 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.


The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left. Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. 


The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrian slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.


That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. 



Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world. ""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. 



Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. 




The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.


PREGNANT.


In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.



All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow. With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa,"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.



Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.
